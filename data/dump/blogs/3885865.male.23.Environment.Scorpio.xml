      " I have  no  friends" : A bitter tale of betrayal  I hard a hard childhood. Begging for scraps like some kind of irishman, bumming cigarettes off tramps to keep me warm on those arctic winters in South Herts. Sometimes I would dream about the regular meals and relative luxury of a Siberian gulag. Yes, my friends, my upbringing was harsh - but I don't my resent being brought into this thankless world. I embraced the challenges my deprived youth offered me. They made me stronger - I fed off my own cruel memories. Fear was for the weak, and the weak were damned. And then hope appeared to me in the form of a generally raggedy binch of scallywags who i learned to call friends. For many years we toiled under the same roof, shared baths and Padre Hordanez broke bread with us all. They were my kin. And no more did I turn back to those breadless winters of my past.   Years later our lives all underwent a similar magintude of transformation. We found religion. Rather, that is, religion found us. Religion perhaps does not best descibe what we found. Others may think of more colourful descriptions: craze, fad... some even called it a cult. Ingrates! What beligerance! After the all the great G'Nre had done to change our world, to make it more ordered and obviously categorised. How could they not see. This great Power had taught me many skills and lessons - a code of living that will stay with me always. And we all loved the great G'Nre equally. We all practised the sacred arts together and with complete priority. There was not a single stray musical note that did not have its place in our corpus of melody. The sincerity with which we completed our tasks was unflinching. But the Work could not be done alone; bonds were formed, alliances made - even within our tight brotherhood. And after many sessions of genrenical toil, I found new levels of trust and understanding with two brothers of the Faith: Brother Danielus and Brother Jamiens. And together we reached new levels of musical piety. We were as close to Genre perfection as we thought possible. Or so I thought.  Everything seemed to be in place. Not a stray note. There were disagreements obviously, it wasn't a science. But we were knee deep in pure musical categorisation. This was the stuff that filled the rivers of Heaven. The ambrosia of melody and rhythm. We were so close. So close to the final card in this fragile pyramid of order and musical classification. And then one day the dream ended. The cunning house of cards came tumbling down. Somebody had pulled the foundations from my world. My genres had been tampered with and my hope destroyed. But who could have have been behind this heinous act. On some level, I had hoped that human hands could not have been to blame...but I knew. In my shattered heart I knew where the responsibilty lay. In the only place it could my faithful readers, the two brothers whom I had once called my kin. There treachery was complete. I had now only the Genres by my side. I have no friends.

      I want to piss on your proverbial fire-of-bon and say that the crack ho den phone has had the small, yet neccesary part that allows you to hang up (mmm important i hear you mutter) has been yoinked by al cos he lost the one on his. So i suggest that we leave the phones as they are. amen.

      I do in fact agree with my good friend Dr J, £1.79 for the coldest winter in the history is very reasonable. Sadly it also makes me wish that we had the heating on for a bit longer, maybe paid £5.79 each for a slightly more pleasant winter. Just dangling a carrot........  And while I'm here and blogging away to my little "morning off" heart's content, I wish to blog an audible "nay" against the motion to swap phone bad for phone portable. My reasons are four-fold:  1. Phone Portable, in its broken-backed and loose aerial state of affairs is also damn ugleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, thus making a swap for a device considered to be marginally less, shall we say easy on the eye, a little pointless.  2. Phone Portable, as implied in the name, is a portable phone. This has consequences similar to those demonstrated by the disappearance of the TV remote in the recent past. Need I remind you of the suspicions directed at a certain person and her ass.  3. Further to point 3 above, the nature of Phone Portable will also create problems with battery power levels not being consistent with long distance conversation.  4. My final point is that Phone Portable has for a long time now not been carrying out its duties as a phone despite being plugged in. The reasons behind this are that it doesn't ring and the reception is poo. Thus it would not be a good move to put it in the lounge.   I therefore propose that Phone Crack Den Landing, a truly aesthetically pleasing device, be moved to the lounge, Phone Bad be moved to the middle landing and Phone Portable be removed from the Telecommunications Gene Pool.  All those in favour scream "Oh Fo' Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure"

      Right Honourable and Learned friends, I've noticed that there are two functional phones that are going wholly unused, while our main House phone is antiquated, cumbersome, upsetting to some, annoying to all and damn uuuuugleeeeeeee. I move to install the portable phone in the lounge thereby replacing Phone Bad. Furthermore, I move to move the blue phone on the Crack Den landing to the wall of the first floor above the current position of the portable phone. In so doing we will rid ourselves of a bad thing, gain access to another functional phone, plus we'll also have more space on the upper floors for leafy plants and Josh's stuff. Finally, I move to throw a stone at lots of birds.   All those in favour say Aye.

      wow wasssuuuupp.  £1.79? has someone plumbed our gas into bridgids? very reasonable for the winter period ideeeed.  Jordan i brought your footba back from the party, it was in your room, in fact im sure we used it at a practice since... maybe it went missing there?  anyway so today i stood for two hours in my football top outside the union asking anyone i knew (embarrissingly few) for money , so that Jordan (not there) and i can go admittedly with the rest of the american football team, to Staffordshire for our playoff game.  We raised about £20 and some of that was in book tokens... never mind it was funny if a little cold.  someone gave us a packet of minieggs, twas a bit like jack and the beanstalk, but we just ate them, so no magical beanstalk to stoke on trent. (note to self write to government about alternative vegetable transport scenarios) does anyone think we will go to war in February? i reckon March if ever. Ciao.

      Dudes, I'm afraid we've just received the gas bill for the last quarter. Those scrofulous rogues at npower want £10.71 of our hard-earned pennies. That's £10.71 as a household - £1.79 each for the witless amongst ye. Payments to yours truly, please. I would post it conventionally on our notice board, but some people have no respect for such things.  Also, has anyone seen my American football? I remember lending it someone but I can't remember who. What ever happened to it after the Superbowl?

      Mr Hersheson, I remind you that the sequestration of House Mandates and Orders within one's room, whether intentional or not, brings with it the penalty of taking out the rubbish. You can avoid this penalty by taking out the rubbish.

      It has been brought to my attention that Mr J. Hersheson has been posting information on the web regarding the HGV. I must urgently inform all readers that the information is FALSE. As a keen observer of behaviour, I have notice that Mr Hersheson is displaying traits which I have seen before in aHGV (acute HGV) patients. Mr Hersheson is commonly know to have what are refered to as 'wet' symptoms. A classic example of these symptoms is the taking of baths to soothe minor aches after 'horseing around'. Another classic example is the inability to erect a simple structure, such as a clothes horse. These symptoms are clearly very disabling. The posting of false medical information represents the classical behavioural trait of HGV patients. That is the attempt to draw attention away from his own illness. Mr. Hersheson is clearly struggling with the state of his health. I feel that as a household we should try to offer him support. I have offered some areas for focus below.   1.The patient feels that his illness is his own fault.                     The illness is the patients own fault, he should not of become a cock jockey. However as the therapist you should try, through guided discovery, to place the blame on the person who was responsible for transmission. This will put the replace the patients deep seated feelings of failure and guit with a much more healthy deep seated feeling of intense anger.   2. The patient feels isolated with his shameful illness.                    Through educational programmes, the patient will be able to learn that they are not alone and this will help to reduce their feelings of stigmatization through normalisation. The removal of the shameful feelings should be determined by the therapist on consideration of the patients history of the illness. In the case of Mr. Hersheson I would recommend that shame he feels is deserved since he became a regular attendent at 'bare back' orgies after the contraction of HGV.   3. The patient may be concerned about how harmful they are to others.                     Sadly not all HGV patients have these concerns. However to those who do, again through educational programmes, the patients can be taught the current guidelines for contact and interaction with the normal population. As the therapist you should try to make clear the extent of the danger they pose, will not compromising efforts to normalise their situation.   As this is a very important and delicate situation, I will be keeping my support and helpline open for extended hours. I can be contact at any time in the evening before 11pm.

      My first Blog has gone wrong. After a comprehensive discourse on the power politics within the upper echelons of Genre Gurus and my deep yearning to have my own Teeny-Bop-Boy-Group-Pop recognised, I accidentally pressed the Delete-All-Insightful-Writ-And-Go-To-RobbsCelebs button on my keyboard. So my moment of inspiration has gone. I shall simply go back to pondering over the hilarity of the word 'poop' and wonder why it is indeed so tempting to say 'lingerie' in a packed lift. Anyway, I have been excluded from the Genre movement, and so for fear of being blacklisted further I shall not comment on current issues.

      Whilst a strolling through the ICD-10 one day, in the very merry month of may. I chanced upon the diagnostic criteria for a rarely diagnosed but very common disease transmitted by the HGV (Human Gay Virus). These criteria include:  - preoccupation with substandard television programmes specifically romantic comedies - having one's hair 'done' - buying oneself flowers  This virus is currently enjoying an epidemic in certain parts of San Francisco, USA and Sydney, Australia and fears are that it may have spread to parts of northern England. Do not attempt to make close contact with anyone who displays these symptoms as it is highly contagious. Anyone thought to have been infected should be paidly referred to the nearest heterosex re-education centre for immediate remasculinization. Be afraid.

      The Art of War: A brief essay in covert tactics  It was cold that day...too cold. Weaker men would have packed up their toy guns and gone home. Weaker men would have wet their panties. Weaker men might have even started to cry. But this was no time for cowardice, this was a time to stand up to the enemy, look him square in the nose and say "mofo, yo ass goin' down". Unfortunately, fear got the better of me and I waited there, surrounded on all sides by paint wielding marksmen who cared nothing about my cold fingers and soiled pants. I wanted to cry, I wanted to put my arm in the air and scream "Don't shoot me I'm full of chocolate". But I didn't, I waited there, amidst the phut of glycerine balls just waiting to pop my eyes like grapes. I waited and I waited, occasionally firing a salvo of badly aimed shots at moving targets, occasionally hitting the odd tree or barricade but never my intended victim. And so the stalemate continued. I sat there, moist from my own urine - more afraid of mortal pain than a tuppenny whore with consumption, whilst my comrades got slaughtered like sambos on lynchin' day. I popped my head around the corner of my barricade. Speeding paint nearly put me out of the game but somehow missed, taking out more of my brothers in arms as they impacted. Whilst my brutal foe powdered their muskets, my goal became clear - the target was in site. I knew what must be done. 'Their's not to reason why but to do and die". And so bodly I rode and well, into the jaws of Death into the mouth of Hell. The crimson flag was in my grasp - victory i cried, victory was surely ours. (and it was - THE END).

      I would like to object to the use of any standardized genre system. As a member of the Covert Unified Non-conformist Troop, I refuse to arrange any of my data into genres. Our Troop feels that systemised genre use represents the over genre-ization of the modern world. It is this genre-ization that is making us slaves to the government. Our time is here. The future lies in our hands. This is it. We must be strong. We have to make our stance. Stand with me. Come with me. Lets take it to them.

It has come to my attention that certain elements in this house have not been abiding by the code of genre practise laid out in the document written entirely under the influence of pyschoactive herbs. I don't think it would be appropriate to name names, you know who you are. Sort it out or i'll sort you out.  Genremaster General

      Maiden Blog.  Messrs Strachan and Hersheson! You threw down the gauntlet...issued me with an edict...I am expected to generate a dazzling literary creation, against which my worthiness in joining your exclusive bloggers circle would be judged. Alas, due to extenuating circumstances (namely whoring myself on the mean and gritty streets of Newcastle Upon Tyne, trying to find gainful employment, and the general malaise and exhaustion that results from such activities) - you will read no such creation today. However, I do feel that as I was the one who pointed out to Mr Hersheson the quote that graces the title page of your worthy weblog, I should be allowed some leeway. AND, perusal of blog archives have left me with more pressing matters to attend to.  Brother Hellyer, you no longer have to stand alone in your fight against genre-isation! Yes, breathe a sigh of relief, as I too abhor this filthy practice that festers in the hotbed of categorisation that is 12 Claremont Street. Insidious ritual it is, and I commend your valour and bravery for not giving in to the 'other side'. The world is not neat and ordered, so nor should our music be! Stand strong, soldier, you now have an ANZAC on your side! (and yes, Josh, I do realise I am not both an Australian AND a New Zealander, but allow me some poetic license, please)... And if anyone can actually articulate to me exactly what trip-hop is, I'll........I'll be impressed, and perhaps buy you a present.  Daniel, may I enquire as to what a pikey is? I like your list idea - please find below ten of my most reviled things. 1. Snakes 2. People eating with their mouths open 3. Sniffing 4. Tight Arses 5. Brits asking me about 'Neighbours'. And also thinking that saying 'G'day Cobber!' to me is the height of wit and hilarity. It's not. 6. Incorrect grammar and spelling 7. Celery 8. Women wearing tights with open toe-d shoes. There is no circumstance where this is acceptable. 9. Insincerity 10. The Olsen twins...Mary Kate and Ashley. Grrr (did you guys get that sitcom over here? 'Full House'?)...  I'll end with a question...how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood???

      Good blog brother Danielus.  I have to say i am in agreement with some, but not all of your ideas, concerns and expectations.  In this article i will discuss a novel mechanism for addressing these points with my opinion: (if any fucker picks me up on my spelling i will bar-b-q their head)  1. What about raw chicken. this is surely worse, it can kill a man at fifty paces and has been known to be an unfortunate consequence of the "drive for dry chicken" - which incidently seems to have acompanied the drive for eastern goodness in our house - hmmm 2. Pasta is bad in the sink i agree, in fact, am considering an action group HASM housegood against sink ming to counter this 3. see point 2 4. not bad as sticking a needle in your eye bad but still uncalled for. tapioca is chicken diarroeha  5. well as a student who never arrives on time i cant comment without serious hypocrisy. i hate them too. 6. mmm remote control. but i dont mind losing stuff too much cos if i loose it it is generally lost. not like Josh "where are my keys - they're in your hands" Hersheson 7. Pikeys do smell but i'd like to point out that chinese people also annoy me coming over here with their stir in sauces. oh HOW conveeeenient. 8. uh hu i hear you brother 9. the skin to skin itch debate. oh how satisfying oh how inappropriate 10. well i love busted but hate girls forever or whatever they are called. TATU. good or bad, i just think its an open debate that one dan.  Thanks for your time. I await further series of my (least) favorite things dan, keep it up!

      I do... I have invited heidi and TomShaw/Johnsstelle to be members in an attempt to spark some life into this blog. If they are poor then we can kill them in an internet way. anyway enjoy: Discuss how gene mutation can affect control of the cell cycle.  The sequence of stages that a cell passes through between one cell division and the next is known as the cell cycle.  The growth phase is split into G1, S and G2 and they are collectively known as interphase, with cell division (mitosis) as M.  Cell cycle control is characterised by checkpoints; points in the cell cycle at which the cell must meet certain criteria to proceed.  These include the G2 checkpoint, passing which triggers mitosis machinery and the cell enters ‘M’.  The DNA must be replicated by this point, the cell must be in a favourable environment and be big enough to proceed to mitosis.  The spindle checkpoint near the end of mitosis checks whether all the chromosomes are aligned on the spindle, whilst the G1 checkpoint at the start of cell division checks whether the cell has grown and is in a favourable environment before allowing it to proceed.  In mammals this checkpoint is known as the ‘restriction point’ as it triggers the replication machinery only if the cell is ready.  This G1-S transition relies firstly on a mitogenic signal and anchorage, both extracellular events.  These up regulate cyclin Ds which cascade to activate, by phosphorylation, an E2F-Rb-(P) complex .  This releases E2Fm, allowing it to activate cyclins A and E, which go on to orchestrate the genes that cause the G1-S transition.  The ‘checkpoint’ operates around this E2F activation, specifically altering the effectiveness of the positive feedback from cyclin E_CDK2.  Inappropriate mitogen stimulation or DNA damage both have the effect of upregulating a key gene: p53.  This gene causes increased levels of p21 which blocks the cyclinE feedback loop, and halting the G1-S transition at this ‘restriction point’ in the cell cycle.  P27, used in the cyclinD cascade, is also liberated on mitogen withdrawal, allowing it to inhibit cyclones effect on E2F as well.  Finally the phenotype of loss-of-function mutants in yeast homologues cdc2 (its human equivalent cdk2 complexes with cyclinE) is arrest at ‘start’, the G1-S checkpoint.  So mutations in this control checkpoint could lead to inappropriate cell progression, and this is known to associate with cancer.  For example, p53, an important tumour suppressor gene, is down-regulated in many cancers.  It’s role is to stop dangerous cells with DNA damage, from proceeding to division and replication, and as the name suggests, stops tumours or malignant cells from proliferating.  Down-regulation of this gene is part of the multi-step process in some cancers, and without it cells with DNA damage have no mechanism to arrest the cell cycle; cyclinE is allowed to potentiate E2F’s release and S-phase proceeds.  This checkpoint is particularly vulnerable to mutation, and over 90% of all cancers have a G1-S mutation.  The spindle checkpoint occurs at the metaphase-anaphase transition and is triggered by inappropriate chromosomal attachment to the spindle, via the kinetochores.  If they do not attach stably and in a bipolar arrangement then Bub and Mad, two proteins attached to the kinetochore, inhibit cdc20, an important cyclin which degrades Pds1 as part of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C).  In the case of abnormal chromosome attachment, Pds1 is not degraded and Sccc/Mcd1, a cohesin, holds the sister chromatids together, blocking cytokinesis.  The terminal mitotic cyclin Clb2p must be degraded for cytokinesis to occur, and this is inhibited both by high levels of Pds1 (when not degraded by cdc20) and through the related mitotic exit checkpoint.  The mitotic exit network’s rate limiting factor is cdc14p, a phosphatase which dephosphorylates intermediate proteins, which cause Clb2p degradation and cytokinesis to occur.  Cdc14p is active in the nucleus, but inactive when sequestered into the nucleolus by Net 1p.  Spindle defects mediated by Bub2 ad byr4 cause tem1-GTP to be transformed to the inactive Tem1GDP.  This keeps cdc14p in the nucleolus, with the end effect of halting cytokinesis.  Mutations in either of these closely related checkpoints (the spindle and mitotic exit checkpoint) could cause cells to inappropriately undergo cytokinesis leading to aneuploidy.  HBub1 controls mitotic checkpoints and segregation in yeast, and mutational activation has shown loss of this checkpoint and caused chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy.  This occurs in many human colorectal cancers, and bub mutations are thought to cause this in most cases.  A CIN breast cancer line has also been shown to have low levels of mad2, a spindle checkpoint protein.  So cancer seems to be a common result of gene mutation in control of the cell cycle.  The real result from spindle checkpoint mutational deregulation is aneuploidy, and this has been postulated to cause tumours through LOH (Loss of heterozygosity) and an increased rate of tumour suppressor gene loss.  Gene mutation in the cell cycle checkpoint components can have profound effects at initially the cellular level, and then at the tissue and whole body level with malignancies.  It achieves this through deregulation of important proteins and enzymes, allowing faulty cells to proceed where otherwise they would have arrested.  Cell cycle control is a major mechanism through which gene mutation causes cancer.

      I would just like to take a short moment to clear up any confusion surrounding my aforementioned post. It should be known that it was not my hand that penned the memo, nor did I have any part in its construction. I can only thank Mr Bowen for pointing out Mr Parkinson's unfortunate lack of editorial rigour. Spelling mistakes, especially when laden with hypocrisy are without doubt the greatest threat to our way of life since the 'garage' revolution. I do however fully agree with the sentiment of Mr Parkinson's blog and would think it a great shame if the perpetrator of those most basic mispronunciations. It must stop. For the good of humanity. Please let it stop.  A concerned blogger.

      "Anomolies"  and "alloted" look like linguistic anomalies to me. Three more and it would be the Crack Den for you, pedant, if we were to go by your draconian rules. However, I'm a proponent of showing clemency to all linguistic offenders. Furthermore, I propose a dissolution of G'Nre Consultancy, for I see not how a governing body can be disinterested and fair if it has to answer to its shareholders. So let there be a prompt end to your acerbic sciolist rantings and hasty judgements, Mr Impostor, lest you want a right and proper shooing from my four-foot ithyphallic priapism so hard that you lose all will to reprimand me for my pleonastic tautologies.

      Internal House Memo:   It has come to the attention of the house governing body, G'Nre Consultancy Ltd, that members of Housegood (we cannot at this point name any names for security reasons) have been guilty of improper utilisation of the language English. This notice comes to you following a 7 month period of intensive research at regular events of inter-house conversations. The current Policy states that any individual bound by contract as a legal resident of Housegood is entitled to a maximum of 5 linguistic anomolies per 30 day period. In the event of a House Member breeching his alloted errors, the Policy requires the responsible individual to be disciplined by the remaining Members of the House. The Individual involved in this instance was found to be guilty of repeated misuse of the word "Emoticon". Serial mispronunciation, particularly "Emoshicons" was recorded in the research.  The Policy also states that guilty parties are entitled to their anonymity in all Internal Memos, as all parties are involved in the research. On the grounds that the individual involved is aware of his mistakes, the governing body G'Nre Consultancy Ltd have issued a demand that the perpetrator be held in the nearest available Crack Den for a period of no less than 24 hours. The remaining House Members are formerly empowered to implement this judicial process. Throughout his detention the Individual shall receive only 35 minutes of artificial light, 200ml of pure water and 1 small tube of Primula cheese. Should the Individual at any point attempt an escape, a nominated Member of the House may formerly administer a "right" and "proper shooing" with any impliment contained within the walls of Housegood, provided it exceeds a minimum length of 120cm. Upon completion of the 24 hour detention, the House Member shall be released to his chambers for a period of reflection, until he feels that he has benefited from this correction process.  G'Nre Consultancy Ltd trust that this matter will be dealt with accordingly.  Thankyou for your attention.

      Someone loses a number of marbles for changing the aphorism at the top of this page. I quite liked the old one and I'm pretty sure that no other member of House Good objected to it, which is appropriate given that such an epigram is on a collective page, and therefore representative of us all. It has now been changed to something which is not representative of all of us. Without undermining the importance of the issue, I humbly request that we leave such contentious judgements off the collective page, reserve them for personal blogs or debate (or just privately held convictions) and return to the old hospitable bon mot.

      I propose a collective embargo on all things Josh. Henceforth heretofore any contributions of his shall be vetoed unless he makes a contribution. This also means that we put heavy heavy pressure on him to stop perpetually sleeping. I humbly suggest that Dan the Grand Communicator be empowered to enforce these sanctions. In particular, for Dan El Gran Communicador to use both force and power to poke Josh's testicles with a toothpick whenever he is in direct contravention of these decrees (a koala should be made to fart on his head if there is merely indirect contravententation).  Dan Le Grand Communicateur should also be promoted to Yogi status at next opportunity.  Also, Jamie gets a marble for good use of multimedia.

      It seems that this blog's main benefactor is Parky (witty and diligent - willigent). Although the blog is also a beneficiary of Jamie's unhinged insomniac contributions, there doesn't appear to be much in the way of house news. So for the benefit of the travellers here is a brief summary of recent events in haiku.  Thieves next door! Tom chased. Nothing taken. Blame gypsies. Might we go to Spain?  Let's watch England play. Tense. Watch Tom's BP. Oh no! God, please heal Tom's stroke.  Jamie buys much fruit. Tessa, where has it all gone? Squits all over floor.  Steelez, how are you? Steelez, here again? What fun. Steelez, leave our home.

      Raise your small withered arm if you have been made to feel this big (imagine the distance between an outstretch fore finger and a thumb) by a rather attractive South African psychiatrist this morning.  Jamie attempts to raise his arm, but the shear weight of it throws him to the ground, as if weilding a large pork steak (large).  Good. Parky i rate your change in question every time you blog. no end of mirth.

      All those who have been out for a 300g steak that was ordered rare and was actually delivered rare, and only cost $11 (which at roughly 2.5 dollars to the pound works out as.....cheap) raise your left arm and smile.  Parky hesitates no more, grinning from ear to ear with the satisfied feeling of lots of steak in his belly and plenty of change in his pocket!! HA HA

      There once were six men, not one was a gay, They all were close friends, but not in a gay way.  Some liked cooking and sleeping, others wrestling and beer, They often showered together, but not one was a queer.  But what united them most, brought them closer than that, Was putting up with the smell, of each other's crap.  One man's doodoo smelt awful, not of roses or vanilla, He wasn't really blamed, cos he did have salmonella.  Another would be grumpy, if by ten he hadn't poo'd, Which goes some way in explaining his perpetual bad mood.  The third would ponder the merits, while sitting on the pot, Of terrine de poule Bresse with sea urchin compôte.  Number four had to be quick, or he'd be an unhappy camper, He'd mutter a little something, do a jerky jobby and then scamper.  The fifth had odourless defecations, in making a smell he was remiss, But he took particular pleasure, whenever he experienced Poseidon's kiss.  The final man suffered, if a lady's visit was anticipated, If she stayed more than a day, he'd be awfully constipated.  The men's house was permeated, by the combined faecal essences, And in this redolent bouquet, all were comforted by the six presences.  But now the same fragrances do not mingle or coalesce, For two have departed, taking their feculent incense.  And only four are now left, who with a moan and a curse, Imagine the Antipodean two, watching their turds flush in reverse.

      well well well  thanks Al for the strong hello, it was so strong I felt it all the way over here in Fremantle, like a wind blowing up me particulars! News report then...... last week was cool, went up to Ningaloo reef up north in the old faithful hire car (all 2 days of driving) saw lots of dead kangaroos in the road that had interfaced with trucks and the like, with disasterous results. We didn't hit any though. The reef was awesome, a little place called coral bay, with a beach called Paradise Beach.....yeah!! did some snorkeling and saw some fish and a ray, said hi Ray and swallowed lots of water. Why does the sea air make stuff smell so bad? I think its the salt...fuller flavour. Anyway caught some sun too, they just have wet and dry seasons up there in the tropics so it was boiling (ie dry season). Started int hospital yesterday and it sucked - we had to get up at 6.45 to get there for 9, and our supervisor wasnt even there so we just milled about and took a couple of histories and had a long lunch etc. Today we had to be in at 8.30 for a teachin session on spider, snake, fish and jellyfish stings etc which was funny (the docs are all quality chaps and chapesses). Due to unacceptable time of waking we have moved out of Heidis and into a hostel near the hospital for the week, prob go back at weekends etc. Today not much going on in hosp so we played with tropicamide drops and then walked round town in the sun - we both have raging headaches now so may go and sleep in a dark room for a bit then go back to work....maybe! Winter MY ARSE!! Catch y'all on the flip side, going tat shopping now......

      well yeah...   another week goes by and Housegood is up to its old tricks.  Having put a football ( a coca cola football, won by our very own tom - 1 in a million as he says... no there were a million footballs tom and you got one of them... i spose that makes you 1 in something though... no too complicated to work out... one in a million will do?) through a window, well through two pains of alexanders window, the temporary boarding up is still there a week later, and al is living in complete darkness and its raining and cold as well.  Jordan is scampering about on the phone to SJ about as often as when they were in the same country, which is sweet.  and i am hanging around with steelez playing computer games til 4 in the morning at the weekends.  oh well actually clems 21st this friday and we went out to the forth in town, and steelez and me were utter heroes saving twiggys marriage by going out to revolution.  but i met this guy who was mates with sheban the landlord, and he was telling me tales of what a shady character he is, having relatives beaten up and the like... yeah so i reckon don't put your photos in the restaurant josh, you might die.  Yeah anyway had fun with clem, and her mates; lots of sluts in newcastle still dan if Perth's not doing it for you...  Other news is hard to come by as revision is kicking in at the mo.  blog off the lot of you. Love love love... do do do love love love do do do as the beatles so succinctly quipped, Jamie

      Hey my boys, how you doing? I have done so well, I'm blogging by myself! Well actually Jamie had to get me going. You will be pleased to know that we are making good use for your spare rooms. Josh, in your room we are keeping a growing number of poodles ( we are up to 49 and due to purchase two more on Monday) and Dan, in your room we are holding weekly local "ultimate fighting" competitions. A local lad known as "Dom the Destroyer" is the current title holder after inflicting a humiliating defeat on Jamie on Thursday night. I how ever won £50 on betting against Jamie (sorry mate).  Hope you boys are being safe in Oz. Tom

      la la la, la la la la la, la la, la la la  make up your own tune, the words still fit. Australia.....very slooooow pace of life, clear blue sky, hot sun during the day (winter my arse) pretty chilly in t'evening but hey its winter (my arse). Not too much jet lag but can't really get my head round the time. It gets dark at about 6pm cos its winter (arse, mine) so we keep expecting dark = bed time a la newcastle in summer, but no. Hired a car, I drove not josh and no crashes so far. and its an automatic with power stearing so don't really need my left leg, gonna chop it off tomorrw. Due to our "arrangement" with the hospital we don't start til monday so the three of us are doing a road trip up north tomorrow, miles from anywhere (I tells ya, the west coast is prety isolated) which will be coooool (but also hot, as its winter, and this is opposite land). No exciting news as yet, still tryin to line up some hot aussie chicks - went out this eve but town was dead, and apparently stays that way til thursday.....boo. sydney should offer more in the way of sluts.  By the way the films on the plane were SHIT but the rest went well.  Hope the house is going well, I'll check with josh about the card. Hope all you other folks round the globe are all good. Steelez, well done son!   Laters potaters

This time tomorrow I will not be on any soil but several thousand feet up in the skydom, being very bored of the skydom and longing for some soil I would think. I hope there are some good films on. I hope I sleep through most of it. I hope they serve free drinks. I hope the food isn't crap. I hope I don't end up sitting next to some sweaty fatty. I hope there are no delays. I hope I remember the tickets. I think we are gonna drop a couple of aspirin at the airport and have a wild trip, we are THAT cray. 3 months, 2 continents, 4 countries, 5 pairs of boxers.....awesome. Catch you all on the flip side. Love Dan

I arrive in delhi at 11pm and I have booked a place for the night which will send a driver to pick me up. I am therefore feeling confident that my first night will run smoothly avoiding any muggings or buggerings. so toodle-pops, I shall keep you informed of my movements. just make sure you all stay safe.

      I must confirm that this place in the jungle is indeed packed to the rafters with loonies, weirdos and other odd characters. I think the jungle must bring out crazies the world over - remember the jungle in Guatemala, Jordan??  Has anyone located Steelez yet, I worry he is being buggered senseless by some crack-head behind the chemical toilets.  Amy - i'll let you know in my next post money running out...

      Firstly, well done to all the boys. Yeah boys. Secondly, a large birthday man hug and shake of hands to Jordan and Twiggy. Yeah birthdays. Thirdly, this here jungle is home to officially the most evil looking spider I ever did see. ITS HUGE. And black. With yellow dots. And its not even hairy, just evil. There is something ever so slightly odd about the jungle, it brings out all the crazies. We had a guy in our room who woke up in the middle of the night yelling "hey...hey...hey...hey...hey...fuck...fuck...fuck...hey...hey" etc etc for quite a while. Odd. And some other guy was hacking coconuts and telling us how fat in its natural unprocessed form can never be bad for you. Didn't discuss the health issues of saturated fats with him, he was a hippy. And then there's the management. Psychadelic. Choice phrases include "fire is flexible, you just gotta learn to move with the fire." Yes mate, if you like. Indeed.  Right I'd better go and wash my self, clothes and all. I stink. Oh yes I do. I can smell me from here. Have fun now peeps.

      hold on hold on, whats going on the known world is collapsing around us. crash, bang, kaboom. i send apologies, somewhat late birthday greetings and tat  to all those affected.  kitty and me have finished our ´works´.  woohee holiday for me! we had a fancy dress party last night, i fulfilled a life long dream and dressed up as a pikey cardboard robot. fun, fun and then a bit more sprinkled ontop. but today i feel like a sea lion with bad farts is sitting on my head . and of sea lioñs, the other week we were walking along, looked into a fenced off garden area and saw a sea lion skegging it on a skateboard. i can tick that one off my list of mustsee things.   ps josh, i am impressed at your intuition. indeed, the secret ingredient to my marvelled tomato sauce is lashings of manjuice.

Happy Birthday also to the good Mr Bowen and Mr Blandford. Leos rule grrrrrrrrrr.  Jordan - tell SJ that I've told my brother to put a plan together to run the shadowy Health Foundation into financial ruin and make sure all of the board members are publically humiliated!!!

      lots of news to tell this evening: Firstly some of you may of heard that "the big chill" festival is going down in my area this weekend. The event is being attended by Nonnie, Hannah and John Steel. i entitled this blog "the big chill: a comedy of errors" 1. The escapades of john steel. John "i still have no job" Steel is working at the event  and was required to submit a deposit cheque to ensure he works the entire weekend. The money left johns account yet the organisers claim it bounced and have been hassling him for money. Johns phone is now without battery so he has essentially vanished from the face of the earth. 2. The escapades of Rhiannon. Nonnie came for tea at my house, the steering rack on her car failed before she was off the farm so i dropped her off at the site to put up her tent on her lonesome (they wouldn't let me in).  Am taking the car to the garage to be fixed tomorrow. 3. hannah has as yet had no escapades but was not arriving until around 11 this eve so i'm afriad will probs have fun getting the tent up in the dark and rain. 4.The escapades of twiggy. i'm going to the godskitchen festival saturday night but a friend of my sis works for the estate where the big chill is held and gets free passes for the weekend and said i could have the ticket for when they can't go which has turned out to be saturday so i can't go either, what a shit.  Other news its my birthday tomorrow, happy birthday Josh and Jordan. well done with the medicinal results See you all soon

      I also happened to leave the brownie cake that my dear mama had baked for my birthday on the train yesterday. It had pure melted chocolate instead of icing. All my birthday cards from relatives packed full of cash were left on the train with the cake. I will now bash the keyboard and rue. zsxccsdfoghadrlgha;rghaerlbadfvbnladbnladnbl'aergn'laekbnladkbn'ladfnv'adklnbl'abn'lasdfbn'lasdbn'lasnv  nlkd;akjg'SKG;\ALSK;AKBN;ADNB'AEIHJ'JHPV;'KV'LKN'PAJADP\Oo\POBJKS\OPJG'OP\OJKB\;OMB;\LADMB;'AMB;ACKMV,ACVK;kfkguieriop3kkgkdvnl;eiprg;egksdmgkdml'sdglsmgsdmgksdm,vc;ldkllsm,vm,c;sg;pantsandboobs

      Happy birthday dear Josh. Hope Dan wasn't a dick like I was when we travelled together and remembered to get you a present.  No post for Josh. Sarah-Jane was flatly refused a bursary from the Health Foundation. Tough bastards. She didn't even get a grant from the University.  Heidi gets a fair dinkum ripper marble for sending me a birthday card.  We've all passed hurrah hurrah.  Well done Dosh and Jan for not being pancakes. But Jew, I thought you hated falling. How hard did you have to scrub your panties afterwards?

      Well done my boys, I'm sure that you all passed. It's my birthday, but only for a few more hours. Perhaps you can all celebrate it for me on my behalf.   Tom S - I reckon that there is no secret ingredient in you pizza sauce. It's just a ruse to get more custom. That or it's your spunk.  House - has any mail arrived for me that looks like it could have NHS stuff in it??\\ &nbsp; Got to go money running out...

      Adventures in human flight:  "Ok, goggles on mate." "Yep." "Ok, cross your arms, head back......1,2....3" "Aaaaahhhhhwwooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hahahahahahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooyeah" "muffled wind noise" "woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo (far out) hahahahahhaaaaaaaawoooooooooooyeah" "more muffled wind, I imagine it was Far Out" "hahahahahayeahwoooooooooo I'm flying"  wooooshsnap  "wooooooooo oh shit ugh" "take your goggles off man" "cool" "how was that?" "pretty far out"  And that was that. I learnt to fly. Following the sustained adrenaline rush of voluntarily throwing yourself from a perfectly good working plane, I fell asleep. Extreme. I have a video of the whole thing so you can all see the look of fear that spreads across my face as I sit on the threshold of doom. A look which is rapidly replaced by flapping cheeks and gums and a big stoopid grin. Lovelyjubly.

      Jumped out of a plane today. Now I am officially an extreme sports enthusiast. Xtreme. I'm sure Dan will fill in the details, I'm too overwhelmed by the experience to type. Tonight I might try BASE jumping off the hostel. As for your question Jamie, flights to San Fran&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;360 poonds with Virgin. This may increase by September but we'll need to book it as early as poss. Josh out.

      I have a number of responses to make.       Kitty: The poo you describe is of course not a poo but an ancient mayan pooworm, and you now clearly have the pooworm disease so dreaded by our forefathers and mothers alike.  My question to you is what clearly rather hopeless measures have you taken to avoid getting a disease?  As a punishment you must click on this star  urlLink *        Dan: You clearly are shitting yourself about this jump, and that makes me laugh heartily. heres a tip - when on the plane with the door open, pretend to fall out - it'll give Josh the willies!! As a reward for such brave behaviour, give yourself a clap (or the clap if the rumours are true)      Josh:  Whilst on one holiday you dream of another. clearly dedicated to the party lifestyle and to your boys. i would be up for an american christmas, but tell me  what is the cost ?    Hurrah

      We all need to know if we are going to go to San Fransisco at New Year's so that we can be book it as soon as we get back. I'm up for it - hang the expense. But I won't go on my own. Have a think, dig deep and 2004/05 will be San Frantastic. All in favour say Aye. Aye.

      At some time tomorrow between lunch and around 4pm myself and Josh will be falling at a giddy pace from 14000 feet strapped to the chest of a complete stranger, who I imagine will have a goatie and will use the phrase "far out" a lot. Needless to say, I think it will be "far out". Not even remotely scared............

      taking the salty theme on a slightly different tack, you can buy packet of crisps&nbsp;in chile that contains all in one, wait for it.. doritos, nicknacks and crinkly cut crisps! a crunch too far or a fry-ghtfully good idea?  i reckon they could go all the way to the top for us indecisive types. or maybe not.

          I did the biggest poo ever of my entire life on Friday. It was a foot long and completely straight. (sorry Jordan,&nbsp;but you know I´m a lady really).  Then we went to a canyon near us which looked like Mars - big big red red hills and nothing there except rock, a salty stream (mmm), 5 trees and dinosaur footprints. Sweet.  Good work on post exam drinking. I missed naked photo - can we have it back?

      Apparently from India Head you can see Wales. This I must question. I went there and saw nothing but ocean. And for that matter, Wales is small and far far away. I should have realised she meant whales. Error on my part. But still, none of them to be seen either. However, there was a whale-fish sighting from our racing yacht as we hammered along at a silly angle. "Whale" came the shout from the skipper. Again this caused me difficulty, the nearest island in view looked a lot more tropical than Wales. I decided not to be a fool this time and went along with it - "oh yeah, cool" said I. And sure enough, a large sea beast broke the surface, winked at me suggestively and squirted salty water everywhere before diving back down to bed. A truly wonderous spectacle. I immediately ejaculated all over the deck hand, I don't think he was pleased, but I'm older than him so I got away with it. Actually that never happened. Its the sea air, fucks with you it does. Oooooooh I'll sleep tonight.

      Easy now. Well done Al for being naked on the tinterweb. Good lad. Not been a blogging for a while due to being in the middle of nowhere and the middle of the sea for a few days - Fraser Island, the largest sand island in the world, and home to many baby eating dingos, followed by sailing trip round the Whitsundays. All was top notch fun, I had the 4x4 on 3 wheels, saw some dingos, drank a bunch of beer, drank a bunch of rum, sailed, scuba dived, snorkelled, played a spot of tennis on South Molle Island and stubbed me toe. Got through 100 tabs in 3 days with Josh - because thats what&nbsp;there is to do aboard a yacht, drank a bunch more rum and pulled one of the crew (woooo). Now feeling a little dopey so not much in the way of amusing stories. Shall try harder next time! Laters.&nbsp;

      UPDATE FROM HOUSEGOOD:  FROM YOUR REPORTER ON THE INSIDE, JOHN STEEL (BA).     Several house mates have expressed different opinions on the difficulty of the exam and at one stage it did seem that a fight was about to break out between an irate Jordan and the ever defiant Alexander. A Rumor of a kiss between Jamie 'torpedo' Strachan and Tom 'too hot' Helyer was confirmed by Edward 'Twiggy' Blandford who was heard to remark; "They were really going for it, tongues and everything".

      We were faced with a problem today in Housegood. the sink was full of liquid fluid. and it wouldn't go away. So jordan said, "well i'm not Josh, i'm going to sort this out properly"      The horror of the situation unfolded, with variou (rice-based) bits and pieces found in the U-bend...     This left the bemused onlookers - Al - feeling like this       that is all.

      steelez i will fill out my profile post-haste, thanks for the reminder.  seem to have discovered something of an untapped niche in  the market here. We have a monopoly on pizza production in town, hungry eyed customers dig deep to buy into the sweet taste of pica pizza. The secret shaw family recipes that creates the mythical taste are more sought after than a ride in maxwell power. With this kind of power world domination of the small business is nigh. moohahahahhaa  tom ´el capo´ shaw   t.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.s. hello jamie.

      That was taken completely out of context, jamie was bullying me for more hannah related dirt and i eventually mentioned that there might of once been a story involving a sex festival but that i didn't know what said story was about and if hannah wants to have a sex festival then she is jolly well entitled to have such a festival at her discretion. I hope that clears things up

      Ah yes, very witty. Very clever, T.P.S.. I would probably feel foolish if I hadn't gone back and edited my last submission.  Jamie, your advertising chat is flawed. Well, I'm sure it would be if I had the wherewithall to pick your argument apart. Shall we leave future discussion to loser politicians (or classicist receptionists) and instead talk about boobs?

      well well well.       turn against me why not. i hope it makes you all feel good having a pop at me, and turning me into a release for the ideals you fail day upon day to keep.    Captalist?!  The reason i shall remove the adverts, and waste yet more of my time not revising is not because you lot are stammering about , but because one of the central premises of a free market is that people are able to make rational, informed choices about what they want to purchase.     In other words, they can compare competing products in terms of usefulness, quality and price. Big-budget brand advertising, however, bombards people with emotional psychodramas about the social desirability of the brand name, rather than conveying rational, practical quality/price information about the product.      So, as a newcomer businessperson, you may offer a better quality, lower priced product than a brand, but unless you have an advertising budget of millions, it’s unlikely that people will purchase from you. They’ll buy a brand instead, as they’ve been brainwashed to do by saturation advertising.    As a result of advertising-led choice, the big companies with huge advertising budgets become even more successful and the small fry – no matter how competitive – go bankrupt or get taken over. This is the business-world equivalent of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Ultimately it leads to mega-sized corporations and, finally, monopolies. This is why i will remove these adverts.   This forum is, and remains a free one, and if advertising has this effect on you, then my point has been proved.      blog out.

      There appears to have been a frenzy of blogging in spite of Jamie's and my reticence. I don't know if I like this...  Josh, your PADI cards are on their way to Cairns via International Signed For Service. Of course, I had to swipe them both through my natal cleft (for you non-medics: that sweet sulcus that lies betwixt the buttocks commonly known as the asscrack) as punishment for your ineptitude in publishing the same blog twice. Nice to talk to you though.  Tom, I'm glad you're still enjoying Chile. Chileans are renowned for their pingpong skills. They made me leave the country because I was crap. Also, have you seen Kitty naked yet?  Steelez, you've authored some inspired blogs, relating in particular to whale sperm (which almost vindicates you for being a parasite on our good home). However, your expositions are devoid of facts. You see, whales produce 400 gallons of sperm when they ejaculate. This is not surprising since they have 22lb testicles. However, when Daddy and Mummy Whale are busy burping the ol' worm in the mole hole, 350 gallons of semen miss the target (despite Daddy's 16 foot penis). So, all you travellers: DON'T DRINK SEAWATER ( you now know why it's salty). Also, Steelez, find a job.  Kitty, has Tom seen you a poto pelado yet?   Jamie, I fear Twiggy and Steelez are right. For those of you who haven't noticed, you can now find banners for Thomas Pink and Laz-E-Boy chairs on this blog. What used to be a free forum has now been converted into a twisted marketplace in which Jamie the capitalist running dog profits every time an unwitting proletarian clicks on the banner (and signs up and purchases a fine TP shirt). Jamie, the historical dialectic will ensure that your counter-revolutionary interests will be beaten down by the hammer and the sickle of justice...I'd quote some Marx and Trotsky at you but there's this lovely Prince of Wales check shirt that would go perfectly with my new easy chair...

      Hello my pseudo-geordie friends. I am sure that despite the tight security that i have tried to maintain word will of by now got out that i am indeed coming to visit this weekend, i know i know that could be considered favouritism but i can't visit everyone now can I? the rest of you will just have to take vicarious enjoyment of my house good visit via the medium of blog.  I would like to offer many thanks to steelez for his Sperm whale worthy facto-file, although he forgot to mention the extensive use of whales sperm as an early wood preservative, hence the common slogan: "does eaxctly what it says on the fin", bad joke but true fact. For those of you who know and love my dear friend warren (the car- not the cats, the computer or our toaster) may we just bow our heads for a minutes silence and mourn the passing of his exhaust pipe and catalytic converter, which had to be replaced in chesterfield (I know!) on sunday at a cost of £290, may we also mourn the passing of my wallet which fainted, hit its head and then had a heart attack.  Dan and josh (or Josh and Dan) have you yet seen a fabled Numbat or a Waratah? - heidi once sent me a picture of a Numbat but i am suspicious that like Hannahs friend Maya this creature does not exist and the picture was of an imposter paid to pretend to be the aforementioned marsupial.  Tommo-went climbing to stanage this weekend and lead up a really nice high HVS (which although easy enough to climb is good enough to give me something to think about while leading) + Al said all my gear placement was "bomber" which i hope means good. you getting the chance to clamber in chile?  Ho hum, best be back to work- peace to all the exiled children of newcastle and will see the rest of you on friday.  p.s Steely is right about the capitalism, i am suprised however since Housegood has always been the single example of a functioning comunist state. is this the beginning of the end? Poor Ivan.

      Hey there Tombo.&nbsp; Your smash sounds simply unfathomable, I can't believe you lost (I blame Kitty).&nbsp; E-mail me a pizza when you get the time, seafood special please.&nbsp; As for Sperm Whales, well heres the facts:  &nbsp;  The sperm whale was named for the valuable spermaceti oil (wax) that this whale produces in the spermaceti organ (located in its head).  &nbsp;  The Sperm Whale has the largest brain of any animal on the planet but still has trouble doing even the simplest sums.&nbsp; Infact if you were to ask a Sperm Whale the answer to the sum 3+2 he/she would probably get it wrong.  &nbsp;  Sperm Whales produce large amounts of Ambergries (spelling probably wrong), a substance similar to cholesterol which was once favoured as a very expensive perfume.  &nbsp;  Sperm Whales have short legs but, when on land, can run very fast.&nbsp; After his 1990 Olympic Games 100 metres victory it was claimed that Linford Christie was infact a Sperm Whale in a Human costume.&nbsp; These reports were confirmed when swimmers off Brighton beach spotted Christie capture and devour a Giant Squid under the West Pier, and then leg it.  &nbsp;  If a Sperm Whale was to actually sperm on a human female she probably wouldn't get pregnant, but the risk of STD's would be massive.&nbsp; To prevent this from happening several former Japanese whaling ships now patrol the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans distributing enormous rubber johnnies from modified harpoon guns called 'Blubber-Blob-lobbers'.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sperm Whales are generally good lads, but you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of one.&nbsp; Marine biologist Grenville Tweed had worked with the species for 7 years and thought he knew them inside out, but in 1986 he was to learn a lesson he wouldn't soon forget.&nbsp; When Tweed electronically tagged a 70 foot Sperm Whale in order to determine feeding patterns in the mating season he accidentally touched the whales lower dorsal fin.&nbsp; In a jealous rage the tagged whales boyfriend, a 85 foot bull called Kaiko, headbutted Tweed&nbsp;out of his boat and threatened to "come after his family".&nbsp; Tweed hasn't been back to sea since.&nbsp; &nbsp;  That's all i know about Sperm Whales.  &nbsp;  p.s.&nbsp; Jamie is turning this blog into a den of captalism.

      good day! &nbsp; blimey you have to work hard to keep up with this thing. well done to all peeps involved with exams, i trust you all blended up a fine storm of charm and wit. &nbsp; me and kitty are still bimbling along in Pica, the strange little oasis town in the desert, and life is cracking on a wild pace. the fabled ping pong match was sadly lost 3-2, a&nbsp;blinding smash by tom in the second game almost took the opponents into retirement but their pinging skills were just&nbsp;awesome.&nbsp; &nbsp; the weekend saw the opening of the freddytomkitty clay oven pizza service - promising the finest flavour in the desert with secret recipes&nbsp;all the way&nbsp;from europe.&nbsp;Pica&nbsp;went wild for the fresh home cooked flavours and the days past in a money doubling bonanza of cheese and&nbsp;dough.  &nbsp; ya &nbsp; t.p.s. twiggy&nbsp;great stuff&nbsp;on the clambering&nbsp; t.p.p.s.&nbsp;steelez - where&nbsp;do sperm whales get their name?&nbsp; t.p.p.s. ´estoy a poto pelado´ means ´i´m butt naked´ in chilean &nbsp;

      Tom, you will always be my superhero...Gayman.  You would wear a black leather thong and shot anal beads out of your fingers, your eyes would produce a KY jelly like substance which would be used to lube up super villians' bottoms.  By day you are a mild mannered medical student but by night you patrol the streets of Newcastle saving lives and generally fancying boys.    Music television?  Not convinced.

      How annoying is it when you writea blog and it doesn't publish!!! AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGgh. hmm.  &nbsp;  I need help again!! I'm nominating Steelez for this mission because everyone else is far too busy. John Boy, I need you to go into my room and look in my drawers for my PADI diving cards, they may be in the drawers on my desk or the drawers by my hifi. I doubt if they're anywhere else. They are blue, and there are two of them and they have my photo on them and say PADI. Look hard, real hard!! If you find them, i'll give you an address to which you must send them. I havent got it yet and your probably asleep or masturbating right now so by the time to wake up or climax, there will probably be an address here for you.&nbsp; I doubt that you'll get this before the Post Office shuts on Saturday but if you could hotfoot it down to the PO on Monday, if you&nbsp;haven't &nbsp;found a job that is!!!!  &nbsp; Cheers mate!!!!

      Josh needs help again.... &nbsp; &nbsp; Before I left, I couldn't find my PADI cards for diving and thusly didn't take them thinking that it would be straight forward to get them replaced. Alas, no. Would somebody in the house, probably Steelez, &nbsp;go into my room and look in the drawers in my desk and the two drawers by my hifi especially the one on the top left. The cards are in an attractive blue finish and may have a paper 'log book' close by to them. Following the discovery of said cards, somebody then wants to hotfoot it down to the post office and mail them. I will provide addresses in due course. &nbsp; I'm counting on Steelez for this task, he's probably not very busy and would jump at any oppurtunity for meaningful work! There are two cards which look very similar!!

      My favourite whale is a Blue Whale cos it's big as fuck.  I also like Killer Whales because they look like vicious swimming panda bears, Dolphins because they jump through hoops and Humpback Whales because they have beards of barnacles.  Sperm Whales must also be appreciaed because of the fact that they fight giant squids in 3 hour deep sea death struggles and because they are named after Captain Ahabs spunky discharge.  I also like Wales.

      Now then Jamie boy, and for that matter the rest of you funky brothers, hope the documentation of the osce is an indicator of good performance all round. What's next on the list of egghams? The rest are easy I reckon. We're in Brisbane today, but just for today like, it looks pretty wank, and no whales to see at all. Josh is not a happy boy today, for he has not got his Padi card.......boooooooooooooooo. I am reasonably happy though.......yippeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Going to go and book ourselves on a tour of the witsundays and fraser island, just for the hell of it. Maybe i'll see some whale-fish. Steelez my good nature-minded friend, what be your favouritistephthisis whale-fish (that&nbsp;is not to say fish, but the special mammal-fish called the&nbsp; whale)????? Blah blah Not funny today, I need a shower (or a shawooshka, heidi?) and some more medicine. Peace. Out.

      Well thank you for all your tips (you know who you are...) this is what happened - for me to look at in the future really, but who knows maybe someone out there enjoying themselves in the sun will really care about my sad little exam... hmmm.  Station 1 History Psychiatry Depression. no surprise there. suicidal and biological, but not too psychotic. Station 2 Explanation Child Health febrile convulsions. and she was reasonably attractive which helped my explanation Station 3 Examination Musculo-Skeletal well this was some sort of joke involving a patient with (allegedly) lower back pain radiating down the right leg.  some post grad guy without a clue. and i didnt really know what to do so i combined neuro and musculo. a general mess all round Station 4 History Reproductive Health post menopausal/coital bleeding. very worried about cancer 'n that. Station 5 Examination CIDR ive forgotten. no ihave remebered it was lumpsandbumps examination. i had a hernia. not literally. then you had to explain treatment to the patient ha what a croq of shit. Station 6 Examination ENT well it was ear pain - so i had to do hearing tests and then auroscopieeee. otitis media following throat infection Station 7 Examination CVS classic. aortis stenosis i had, but then who knows really. other people had AF. Bo-ring Station 8 Skill CIDR HA! fundoscopy and dipsticking urine, spent most of the time sliding medium sized gloves onto my sweaty and very definitley large sized hands to test the urine. i said pappilodema, but apparently it was hypertensive retiopathy. bugger. Station 9 Examination FocP ummmm. nah forgotten. oh yeah GI exam. Station 10 History ID oh this was a right laugh. he had cough and SOB with an exercise tolerance. but id forgotten there was an ID history so i just told him he had ischaemic heart disease. but the he mentioned the anal warts and i laughed out loud by accident, cos i thought he was joking. it was an actor id met before and hd a chat with too. anyway turns out he had HIV! UNLUCKY! Station 11 Images X-Ray Pneumothorax with clavicle fracture, lobar consolidation and massive R pleural effusion. had to give signs as well Station 12 Images Dermatology Acne. describe, talk about treatments and then a quaint opicture of some dry cracked lips - what treatment have they started now? oral retinoids of course! (thanks JS) Station 13 Images Child Health thanks to kitty - dextrocardia, measles and trisomy 21 Station 14 Images CIDR fractured neck of femur (dodgy picture of someones leg a bit shorter than the other...) osteoarthritic hands and ???dupytrens (sp.) contracure/ triggering of some fingers Station 15 Images CIDR Video of ataxic and parkinsonian gaits   wash your hands people

      Watch Whales, they are even bigger than dinosaurs and therefore ultimately great.  They're not fish, they're mammals just like you or i.  A fully grown whale, despite its size, is not a dangerous animal and feeds only on small plankton and stray swimmers.  Unlike its cousin, the shark, what feeds on small swimmers and stray plankton.  Pinocchio was eaten by a whale but escaped by tickling its sneeze reflex with his absurd wooden nose forcing the whale to sneeze him and his mates (Gepetto and Jiminy Cricket) to relative safety.  More whale knowledge will follow.

      Yes yes, good luck boys, good luck indeed. Remember to wipe your arse after each patient and make sure you avoid full eye contact at all times. And be sure to wear a hat. That's important. Well, we come to the end of our Byron adventure.....we have seen so much, learnt so little and got burnt on the beach - WINTER MY ARSE ha ha ha love it I do. Offered anyone a lift to Brisbane (or Bris Vegas if you will) in the hope of three (yes three, not one more, not one less) hotties wanting a lift and a good time, but so far we have incurred some interest from a gent who looks like limited fun.......we could just not take him? What would you all say if I announced I was a keen whale watcher?.................dot dot dot..........dot question mark?

      Dudes, I need some help. I need to fill out an application form&nbsp;for one of the medical schools I am applying to [no doubt in vain], and on it, they ask silly questions like 'What qualities do you think doctors should possess?' and 'What are the most important of these qualities?' and of course, 'Why do you want to study medicine?'. Now, of course I shall answer with my own reasons, but I would be interested to hear what y'all think - what do you reckon they want to hear? &nbsp; Good luck with your exams boys! I have to do that ridiculous psychometric test for medicine again on July 28th, preparation for which is taking up all my waking hours.

Picture our antipodean chums crawling through the outback, desparate and dehydrated, happening upon an oasis consisting entirely of brandy, they'd be fucked, not even steelez's plan B could prevail.  Good luck with the job hunting mr steel- have you tried cente of life?-rumour is they'll employ any lo i mean they'd probs be looking for qualified geographers.

      Johns Steels job hunting diary.  Day 2 (update).  Nearly finished my new and improved CV, just need to phone home for some referees.  My search for a job on 'tinterweb has thus far heralded no success and my disillusionment with post university life grows ever stronger.  All the graduate jobs are in business and shit like that.  Oh woe is me, is this to be my lot in life?  A faceless 'suit', a wretched winnit in the arse cress of the capitalist system.  NAY!  I won't let it happen, I'm going to take the bull by the horns, make myself a ciggie and stride forth once more.    The search continues.

      John Steels job hunting diary.  Day 2.  After the disappointment of finding that I have no CV on day one of the hunt, I decided to take a more hands on approach.  After confidently showering in the good house, eating somebody else's food and rolling a snout I left for Newcastle town centre with an air of pre-pubescent trepidation.  First stop, The Trent House (incorporating World HQ, two birds with one stone I hear you whisper).  Alas and alack; "not taking on till September mate, come back then" was the repost of the barman (whom I suspect was 'good with colours').  Undaunted I traveled further into town. Old Orleans; "nothing at the moment mate", fuck you then didn't want to work in your shite themed bar anyway.  Huxters; "just drop in a CV", that's a maybe then, if only I had a CV.  Apathy took me.  To ask in every bar in town would be a fruitless task, I needed a new plan.  It would be called Plan B and would not be great.  To the Uni Job Shop!  Now, you'd think that the job centre of one Britain's leading bastions of academia would have some jobs fit for an avid 'work wanter' like myself.  You would be mistaken.  Shit pay, worse hours and crap jobs (back to EST EST EST? Yeah, 4 quid an hour and no tips, do me a favour!).  Plan B lay in tatters around my sullen feet, and yet in this hour of desperation I was suddenly touched by inspiration.  What was I doing looking for a shite job anyway?  Jordan was right, I should use my Degree to my advantage and seek the job of my dreams, a job that pays well and one in which I feel happy.  So to the interweb to apply for some 'proper' jobs.  I hear they're looking for dancers in For Your Eyes Only, I'll make a killing.

Not piss on the seat.  3. Be told that there are a couple of fit lesbians snogging and not go and have a look.  4. Admit to somebody else having packed my bags when checking-in.  5.

      First up, Heidi you do well to mock my smaller than average interest in flighted creatures of the skydom, and yet you must now sit back and accept that I am not alone in our circle of friends.....I told you brother Steel was an out bird fancier. I told you, yes I told you good. Whilst I cannot deny the charge, and I am pleased Steelez was big enough to support me, I must make it clear that it is but a passing interest that began many moons ago at small people school, and any real knowledge on the subject has more than failed to come my way over the years. Yes, it WAS an osprey, of that I am sure, but my remark about the eagle was more along the lines of "fuck me, look at the size of that eagle". An eagle for sure, but its name I do not know. Anyways, birds are cool for the same reasons that Steelez has already mentioned - they can fly, which as any boy knows is cool as fuck, and any girl who doesn't know that is missing out. Secondly some birds have funny names like "tit". And whislt we're on that subject lets not forget that I also like birds with tits, fnar fnar.  I am a fan of the ever expanding collection of names at the table of blog - Twig, welcome young man. And Tom and Kitty, you guys better win that ping pong tournament. Any medic worth their salt must surely be a master at the table of tennis. May the force be with you.

      Given the recent frenzy of recent blogging recently, I thought I might capitalise on my most recent blog with another - not least to try to dispel this scurrilous claim that I am unconscious more than I am not.  I will first provide you with some intersting facts that Dan and I have gleaned over the course of our time in Oz.  1. The moon is not as it should be. It has been hung just more than a little Irish in the night sky. Sometimes it is not there at all. Perhaps it is a lazy fat moon.  2. The weather is a fickle beast in the Winter. Bastard clouds.  3. Most Australians like pies. In fact there are many pie shops selling many pies in many varieties. So far I have eaten six pies. I like pies.  4. Without exception, all buskers in Australia possess less skill at creating music than would be reasonably be expected from a dead man.  5. Beer comes in many sizes of glass. With baffling names that are probably derived from some obscure Aboriginal system of weights and measures. I think perhaps they used the boongperial system.   More will come I'm sure. If only I can stay awake long enough to tell you about them.  Today I saw a man on the beach engaged in what I can only assume was an attempt to engage in autofellatio. Dan told me he found that: "quite a sexually arousing image."  Why is Nonnie abusing solvents?  Have any dead animals been located in my bedroom?  Steelez - when does fresher's week start?  Snoochies!!

      Birds, my dear Heidi, are natures greatest mystery;  How do they fly?  Why do they lay eggs?  Do they have ears?  Why are some of them different colours?  Are they angels sent down from Jesus and our Lord God?  When do Doves actually cry?  Parkinson, myself and our insular community of 'Twitchers' are merely trying to answer these conundrums in the name of science whilst enjoying the beauty of these feathered freaks.  Just the other day whilst out on a bird watching trip to the Shetlands a young girl approached me with a ponderance;  "Mister, mister" she was heard to remark, "what's so good about birds?"  "Birds" I replied, somewhat taken aback by what appeared to be a crack pipe she was carrying, "Birds my dear can fly, and anything that fly's is okay by me.  Is that crack?"  I hope that answers your question.

      An Osprey AND an Eagle in the space two short days, great birdwatchery Parkinson.  The only bird of prey that I've seen (in the wild) was a lowly Kestrel, which is very common in British towns and cities.  I say Kestrel, it may have been an overweight Starling.

      I'll blog you in a minute, Jamie 'Smart-arse' Strachan!  Jordan, you asked for simple slander aimed at Josh... while I will gladly acquiesce to this request, and suggest the creation of some sort of formal written petition to try and put a stop to his infernal sleeping, the main source of the following waggery will be young Daniel Parkinson.   Yes, thats right. I've kept this to myself, but it demands to be blogged. I do believe Josh was intending to, but no doubt he's sitting somewhere in Byron, head tipped back, mouth slightly open, snoring gently. Dear Dannos, forgive me, but it's just too funny to keep to myself.   It all began when Josh, Dannos and I pulled into Kalbarri but a few weeks ago. We meandered down to the river front to watch the sunset and take some photies and such like. After a few minutes, Dannos exclaimed loudly and with wonder apparent in his tone, 'Is that an osprey?!'. Hmm. I shrugged, as frankly, I've got no idea what an osprey looks like, nor do I have any desire to add to my ornithological repetoire - however, the....suprise and delight in his voice was of such a level to be noted by my good self [and i do believe Josh also] as, well, odd. The night progressed, and while my memory [and hearing] are a little hazy, I do believe Dan did make reference [with enthusiasm, let it be noted] to the bird a few more times. I thought this was plainly hilarious, and twas then when the truth came out - Josh accused Dan of being a twitcher, and Dan did not deny. Furthermore [and this is why you should be alarmed, boys] he made reference to a certain man who may or may not be a permanent member at Housegood with whom he shares this trait, who encourages it in him. Dare I presume a mentor in twitching ways? Who is it, I hear you ask? Hmmm...]  Anyway, the next day Dan spotted an eagle. I don't believe I've ever seen a man so - impressed - by a bird before.  So, in conclusion, Dan's a twitcher!! Whoever would have thought? Not me. Oh no, not me. Perhaps you had to be there to be affected by his enthusiasm and delight. I think this is hilarious. Birds...bloody birds! Hahahaha.

      Hello my friends, this is my first blog so i hope i don't mess it up (a blog virgin no less). so where do i begin, how to compose a successful blog? how would the manager of teen rock band "McFly" go about it? ok copying busted will get me no-where but perhaps a formula will. as far as i can see all good blogs start by insulting Josh, who is far away and probably asleep so unable to defend himself, good. Secondly the best blogs will describe steelez's attempts to become a housegood resident - to save you boys the effort i have something for you to hang in your hallway (please see attachment). Thirdly a bit of toilet humour boobs, bums or maybe faeces and a classic blog is born. this is easy. Ok as to my recent goings on, tom shaw may be interested to hear that i climbed an E1 the other day in the peaks (sorry to those to whom this means nowt) a really enjoyable climb if not a scary lack of protection. For those oo are wise in the ways of scince i have identified we think hepatocyte progenitors in my cell cultures and are about to start large scale frankenstein style liver growing, hooray. Clem is now "roughing it" round central america having flown into mexico on sunday and having had their bags lost by the airway, should get them back soon though. I hope to have developed my rhyming skills in time for my next blog. take care of yourselves (and each other) adios   urlLink Steelez.jpg

      A very good evening to you boys and girls of the blog.  It has been a while since my last contact, for this I am most sorry. Myself and the man Josh have now left Sydney (aboard a large yellow Hyundi) and have come to a less than sudden halt in Byron Bay. Here we have made a camp in a dorm room with some other fellas, ooh it smells wonderful in that room. Now for all those who are not sure of the geography of Australia (clearly steelez need not listen) Byron is about a 10 hour drive north of Sydney, managable in a day. And as for Byron itself, lets just say its fit. Surf, mahoosive beach, sunshine (at last, huzzah, damn you cold front, leave us alone), honeyz, and last but by no means least - a "seriously guys, help yourself to my weed, its cool" atttude from the chap in our room. Very friendly! Naturally we have been doing, including hotboxing our lovely, roomy hire car last night, oooh that was a larf. Stinks today like!! And what with a bit of sunshine, we have been on the beach today. And tomorrow I imagine. Thursday we shall visit Nimbin, where the people run the town and not the police, and shrooms are common place etc etc (according to the lady cutting my hair, not now you idiots I'm on the computer) Then we simply must drive to Brisbane on saturday to return the lovely, smelly hire car. After that, heck I don't know.  Boys of the good house, Housegood, what a thrill it is to read about such crazy antics as a poker tournament. Long may it continue. Non, a pleasure also to hear from you in verse. Jordan, how is the poo job working out for you? Was it a factor in your purchase of a new game? In answer to the question posed, I'm not sure it was a good idea......but fuck it. Cheers to Al for the email, some good lads indeed.  Right I'd better go and wake Josh up, ha ha ha ha ha ha classic Josh "I think I might have a nap" Hersheson. Good lad. Doritos I think, I'm hungryphthethsis......

      Ah, Rhianon, how marvelous to see a blog in verse. Be thou Euridice to my Orpheus and we'll throw our care to the winds as we blog furiously in rhyming couplets or iambic pentathlon.   I would like to put to this noble forum the following question: are we collective fans of sparse single-sentence blogs from irregular bloggers? I cite as my main examples Heidi and Tom Shaw. I find it quite thrilling that they blog, but I would be all the more excited if they were to contribute a medium length exposition on their activities. Failing that, some simple slander aimed at Josh would suffice.  What think the rest of you?  It is now four days till our first exam. Jamie and I just bought a new Xbox game. Was this a bad idea?

      ...BLING... [Magic fairy dust flies through the air]  It's been one day since last I wrote On the blog "I am a goat"! And here I am, one day more to tell you how I'm a little sore.  For today I ran for seventy minutes, "I don't believe it!" cry the cynics! But yes, I am now a true athlete, and slowly my bum is getting sweet However, I have just one complaint, My feet, the smell - they make me faint!  So if somebody could soon post, A secret way to make me boast a smell so heavenly and divine, from these poor little 'toots' of mine.... ....... I'd be extremely grateful!

      Jordan failed to mention the fact that i won, opting instead for some kind of thinly veiled threat and (much to my annoyance) spelling my name with an 'e' on the end.  I dearly hope for his sake that this was not a deliberate act of war.  Just had a can of Dr. Pepper, what a truly splendid drink.  Although i would argue that it is a gas rather than a liquid.

      Oh what a sight for a procrastinator's sore eyes! What marvelous happenings have taken place.   Nonnie, how wonderful that you have joined the blog. It's always lovely to be regaled by your postcard comuniqués, and now we have online versions. Your spelling sucks.  Jamie, my intention was to make all and sundry aware of the enormity of my snake, as in Jamie hat eine kleine Schlange (Ist Internetübersetzung wunderbar nicht?) However, I shan't deny that I do proudly own a large queue.   I fear that our inaugural gambling event, like a faulty sigmoidoscope, hasn't been adequately entered into the annals of history. So for the benefit of the non-participants (including Alexander "I don't play with the other boys" Finlayson) here is the briefest of synopsisesphthisises:  The first night of the House Good World Poker Tour was a momentous eve in which fortunes were lost and reputations made. No-limit Texas Hold 'em was the name of the game, one in which the stakes were high but the scruples low. Fortune and Serendipity smiled sweetly upon the few, as several consecutive high-ranking hands determined the high-rollers from the start.  Thomas "No guts, no blue chips" Hellyer was the first to leave the game, his intimate knowledge of the rules no use to him.   Jamie "I'm always bluffing" Strachan seemed to be all set to walk away with the pot, but lost it all in a series of ill-judged hands and was second to leave the table crestfallen.    The game progressed to a battle of the wills between the two remaining players, John "Jordan's cheating" Steel   and Jordan "Shut up you ginger Turk, I'm not cheating" Bowen.    Alas, the gods had picked their favourite, and the Fates had destined the honourable to walk away penniless while the lowly rejoiced.   John Steel, this is not over...

      "Isn't mainframism great": a discussion.  Jamie: Well i think that computers are the future. John : I heartily agree and strongly believe in the pervading culture of mainframism. Jamie: without wanting to appear solipsistic though some people think mainframes could one day replace any human contact. I think  this  would not be a good idea. John:  Or could  this  be a good thing?  Undoubtedly and without a doubt no. Jamie: Never mind the buzzcocks, what about me? I think that humans are the source of all good but yet all evil as well.  Therefore to eradicate evil we must eradicate good.  This should probably involve castrating bishops and popes. Eh? what say you? Eh? Eh? what. tell me what? Eh?               EH? John:  Sounds a bit like the basic plot structure of arguably the greatest movie of all time; the one with Christian Bale and Sean Bean in it...but without the Bishop and Pope castration...and guns...Equilibrium.  Ace.   Jamie:  Ah. Haven't seen it, but it sounds  rubbish . Anyway the best thing about mainframes is of course the intelligent banter and well rounded arguments we have on this here blog  NO. its not. its b oo bies.  b oo bies! ha. John:  And bums.   That's all for now.  Goodnight everyone, sleep well. Jamie:  what? Ok. Fine yes. Bye.

      Hello all you beautiful people out there... tis I,your fairy godmother Noonie!!  I ahve come to save you all from the boredom of (a)revision, (b) having no job and (c) being abroad.  I shall do this by telling you of my daily troubles in the welsh "pig's ear" (The Guaridan, sat 10 July) which is Barry, South Glamorgan.  Today, I woke at 9am, went to the shop, bought observer, walked home, had fruit and yoghurt for breakfast (trying to give up all things wheaty), got high on walpaper stripper, had gooseberry tart (forgot about wheat thing!) for lunch, rang steelez on mobile (should have just used housegood phone!) to remind him of big chill, got even higher on walpaper stripper, then went for a lie down in garden.  Fell asleep in garden for an hour and a half, woke up freezing, then came inside and practised my salsa spins in my new salsa shoes,  took off the polish on the wooden floors, got told of by my mum, now sulking on the computer.  Later on I will be going to see Fareniet 9/11.  Hope I have brought a little magic to your days!

Conversely, i might just never use it due to unforseen confusion.  Incidently, Jordan really likes me being here he's just trying to be the 'big man' with his online mates.

      mug number 5 was a good one, enough tea to drown in but needs two bags. Sadly no handle now so loses points. mug numbers 8 and 10 are also good sizes for a sturdy brew, and number 9 wins points simply because it belongs to me (actually so does 2). However the winner for me has to be mug number 3, the reason being the bottom of it is so full of funk.....good to see you are keeping up old traditions in our absence!!

      Halo Ha. today i watched Van Wilder Party Liason (american trash mainly, but a fun romp all the same) and angel eyes (Jlo why oh why) because it was raining. i interspersed it with olympic madness which is simply sporttastic at the mo.  Opening ceremony: apparently good. missed it, Judo: i wish they'd just hit each other. its all grappling and no happenings.... it seems, Badminton: boring, Sailing: fit commentator, Gymnastics: japeneseees with massive shoulders. huge. they are all small though, Cycling: british hope nicole coooook failed to actually cycle fast so she lost. someone should tell her, Shooting: 4 gays, Rowing: i agree with john some good lads, Boxing: 4 gays, Swimming: they're all so young. its dangerous,  Basketball: missed it, Hockey: 4 girls as John said, Archery: what. when was that, Beach Volleyball: boooobies and bums great.  well done John on getting a job and getting to watch all that olympic goodness. well done Dan for showing your wholehearted support for the American debarcle, come on anyone else? well done Twiggy for blogging such an insightful comment. not well done for blogging it 18 times. i tidied it up. as a general rule once you push publish post once, no matter what it looks like on your screen it is probably in the blogger somewhere. so just push it once. and hope.  mainframe.

Non is a raven haired lawyer with a penchant for fashion whereas John is a lady loving football coach extraordinaire with a receding hairline. Can anyone else think of any celebrity couple-alikes?

      IT HAS FINALLY HAPPENED.....A JOB!!!!! Yes I have a job, it's not much but it is a job, in Smoothie Wrap to be precise down in the big market. Only 4.30 an hour, but it's cash in hand so no tax and I can sign on (if I was a fraudulent type of guy-which I'm not) and I get a 30% discount in Union and Maverick and free food. Not bad in my opinion.  The Olympics have begun and Team GB are utter wank, apart from the synchronized divers who got a silver (still didn't win though, the tiny trunked surrender monkeys). I can't watch the weightlifting for fear that one of the freaky competitors will shit out his/her guts while lifting. For those in foreign countries here is an in depth review of the games so far. Opening ceremony: impressive, I was drunk, Judo: dull, Badminton: good in campsites, Sailing: suspicions of inbreeding, Gymnastics: no tits, Cycling: get a car, Shooting: easy, Rowing: some good lads, Boxing: unnecessary violence, Swimming: knackering (no tits), Basketball: USA battered by Puerto Rico (My highlight so far [badly stoned]), Hockey: undoubtedly shite and for girls, Archery: Robin Hood no show for Team GB, Beach Volleyball: restrictions on size of bikinis...absolutely ace.  As for America at New Year, highly unlikely, my fear of terror is far to high.

      I shall express my interest and excitement about a trip to see the Lynch. Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. And a couple more wooooos just for good measure. As for flights, I live neither close to London nor to Edinburgh so I don't really care. As for visas, I believe you are correct, we will need a visa even as British citizens. Bloody yanks, don't trust anyone these days.  The bus from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City was hell. The living end you might say. And someone stank of fried chicken. I blame the fat kid. We are both tired and getting close to killing the pesky cyclo-taxi drivers for their relentless hassle. Off to the chemist for some valium then?

      dash damn bothery. the internet in the highlands is weak and pithy, its is worse than india tomofindia so it seems. Have returned from the hills, it was midgie. but otherwise good.  Josh and all others who would be up for America new year 04/05: i can fly with LUFTRENHAUSEN or whatever they're called to SanFran from Edinburgh for 331 poonds ("fuck the poond") which is cheaper than going to london to fly with virgin for 365. so there. some chat on news at moment about visa needed by uk visitors to the us only available in London. that would suck. anyone up for it? Eian is very excited at the prospect and invites everyone.

      Goodevening to you gentlemen and gentle lady folk. Myself and the Josh have had a most relaxing day at the health spa today, sitting in pools of shitty mud and hot natural spring water to cleanse our dirty bodies. We then went for a massage. Ho ho ho I could tell you some funny tales. It wasn't old men in pants for a start so that was a bonus, and I don't think Josh was abused this time round. For myself, I experienced a perfect example of the cremasteric reflex and had my lilly white butt cheeks kneeded like never before. If only she knew how mucky my arse was yesterday. And to top it all, whilst on my back having my thighs oiled up, the old lazy lob decides to fall out of the shorts, oh the comedy. Naturally I left it there, she didn't seem to mind. Dirty bitch. Good looking though. Bet she was on the game too. Sauce.  As for an update on my poo, it is now like passing small hard boiled eggs. Great.

      For the attention of Tom of India, regarding inparticular the finding of girls to misbehave with:  Tom, I don't know about you, but despite the obvious attraction of a bit of boddy-pop-pop with an attractive young lady, I'm thinking being anywhere close to another persons sweaty skin in this heat is less than a turn on. I have all but given up looking. I'm not being a dick, just danglin' a carrot etc etc.

      According to my reliable timepiece, yesterday was friday 13th. Oh what a day to choose to fly. Sat in the departure lounge at Da Nang Josh declares "I hope it isn't a twin prop." Guess what....you bet your bottom dollar it was a twin prop. Flying never felt like that before, you actually get the sensation of falling when you begin the descent. A family of crazy Swedes (oh they're all crazy) that seem to be following us around Vietnam were sat waiting for a different flight. Turns out they had boarded, and were told to get off because the engines didn't work. I hope they are all still alive. Anyways, with that under our belts I figure we survived the unlucky-for-some day without incident. My (and it would seem also Josh's) bowel had better ideas. Unaware of what guilty piece of food was responsible for the cramp and nausea of the previous day, and needing a break from the usual bowl of noodles we went for a tex-mex alternative. As you can probably imagine I awoke early this morning with what can only be described as the "icy jaws of death" and ran to the toilet to purge my body of a massive quantity of foul smelling gas, followed by a looser than I would have liked poo. The saga continues.......

      What beautiful prose. I am great aren't I.  Joshua, my mobile number is 07739161174...never phone me you bumper clad natty dread. Tom, the skin irritation of which you speak is probably Peterson's Syndrome; named after Sir Rudolph Peterson, the one time director of the East India Company in the mid 19th century, the skin complaint starts as a rash and gradually spreads eventually turning the sufferers cock and balls into a steaming platter of Bombay Potato. The only known cure for this most bizarre of medical complaints is to kiss the ugliest man in Bangalor on his breasticles.

      well folks the adventures here in the orient are building up thick and fast. you think you've got some rain in england, well....i got stuck in some monsoon rain yesterday on a hillside (not very safe) and it rained for almost one hour so it was getting pretty dangerous. i was crapping my self, fearing that i might get caught in a landslide. along comes this lad and his buddies who safely bring me back to his house where they gave me tea, gifts and later food. i was there for three hours... they thought that i must be lonely because i was travelling alone and so made me stay. this lads sister was a real diamond in the rough aswell.  i later found out that the path i had been walking on had later collapsed and that the old city was so flooded that people were swimming in the streets. in sharp contrast to this example of indian generosity and hospitality, earlier that day some unsavory characters tried to get me involoved in some gem exporting scam.  so thats my latest. i am off to the desert tonight for some filthy turban and camel action. i smell like shit but luckily so does the whole of indian. i have also developed some kind of blotchy rash in response to the heat and humility....i hope my skin doesn't fall off. anyway toodles Tom

      Wow what a blog fest this week has been. I however have withheld the urge to blog since this has been the worst week ever and so have had nothing cheerful to blog so there. On that cheerful note clem is back in 2 weeks- hooray! Josh and Dan: you will be the best dressed travelers in all the the eastern orient, keep it up. (you should of told the NY monster that the answer to looking sexy while travelling is to buy some dapper suits). Steelez: did you snog Will Young yet?- you could be the next Faria Alam with some kiss-and-tell antics Tommo: wanna arrange a climbing trip when you get back? Nonnie: congratulations on finding a house in leeds- if i can think of someone to sue will you do it for me for free? Al: do you know what a proto-oncogene or a fusion protein is yet?- which is your favourite neoplastic fusion protein? Jamie: you're rubbish and still haven't been to visit notts yet, whats that all about? To everyone: when are you all back in Englands moist bosom (i said bosom ha ha) fraid i have no more chat- Rubbish

      WOWZER!!!  Picture the scene if you will; Me, perched on my bed at about one in the morning, wearing nothing but a pair of very old boxer shorts, cigarette perched flamboyantly between my ruby lips as I wait for the onset of perfect sleep. The silence is interrupted by the Turkish March that is my ring tone, no caller i.d....i hope it's not a wanker or a gay. After the callers initial attempts to try and dupe me into purchasing some home security, his disguise fell from him like the dress of a whore. It was Brother Al, all the way from the good ol' U S of A, and he had managed to utilize the excessive levels of science at his disposal to make a trans Atlantic call...To a mobile!! Knock me down with a feather, the things they can do these days. Thus, I feel it is only fair that Alexander is re-installed as my favourite, and it is going to take something special to knock him of his top spot.  In other news; Today I used an umbrella to protect me from the rain...rubbish, my pants are soaked through worse than the other day (when I didn't use an umbrella). However, they do keep the rain off your ciggies.  Everyone stay real.

      Well I think Jamie and Steelez should give themselves a firm pat on the back for being regular blog-artists. Tom and Al also receive small awards. In fact Tom gets an extra marble for driving his driver around. I imagine that was a funny sight.  I have the squirts today.  No we are not getting matching pinstripe suits, don't be a silly. Mine is blacker than black, and Josh went for a very fetching grey. I also got a white shirt and a short sleeved shirt. Josh also had a couple of shirts made. And I bought 4 ties. And Josh bought 2 ties. And Josh bought some other stuff not clothing related. And it still came to less than 200 Dollars (American). And whilst we are on the subject of Americans, I have a question - are all New Yorkers tossers? We met a monster last night. She was a tosser, hence my question. And she was complaining how it was impossible to look sexy when travelling. I was wondering if it was possible for her to look sexy at all. Me thinks not.  I shall finish this here blog in the style we seem to have adopted as standard:  Jamie - Don't go to Inverness again. Did you give Lynch the blog talk? Steelez - Mach 3 is a far superior razor, look at the colours it comes in. Its not raining here. Tom - What's all this talk of you and Rick Shaw? Don't be a gay. Al - What can you tell us about Mayo? Is it fattening? Heidi - I couldn't open that last email you sent me, sorry. Was it funny? Jordan - Stop hiding, we know you are out there somewhere. Tom - Stop looking at Kitty's tits. Kitty - Put your tits away, Tom's looking. Twiggy - You wan motobi to beach? Where you fwom, Englan? Beckam yes? Non - Avtar Properties are also called the mafia.  tata

      Hi, I am impressed with all the bloddy blogging that is going on. i believe jordan will soon emerge from the jungle and blog... its just a feeling i have.  I went to Inverness today and i really had forgotten what a shitty city it is, i think i had foolishly romanticised it in my head as a quaint Scottish retreat. Its full of neds and goths (not even the nice kind) and it rains all the bloomin time.  and the shops are Rubbish (capital letter justified).  mmm  any way i have a question for all those who have been to ITALY.  where should i stay as in hostel wise? any reccomendations of things to do as well.  am planning rome florence... switzerland etc. so yeah where should i stay? thankyou all.  Parky and Josh (i cant blog it hurts my little fingers): ARe you getting pinstripe suits? i hope so, get them matching in blue, you'll look mcCool on the street. TomH: Steal a rickshaw Al: steal an embryo Kitty+Tom: Steal a baby hispanic child Jordan: Steal away in the night Stealez (haha): dont worry its raining here too Heidi: are you alive Twiggy: high five Nonnie: welsh haha

      The rain has ended and once more the sun beats down upon my hairless head with a ferocious venom.  This morning i had my first wet shave in over a year and found that my long forgotten facial skin was as beautiful as ever.  I used a Wilkinson Sword FX Diamond razor as it was three pounds cheaper than a Mach 3 Turbo (from Gillette).  After initial reservations i found this razor to be both close and gentle, leaving a good even finish with no irritation.  Life in Newcastle is dull.  But at least the football season has started.

      hi kids, this is the second time i have to write this as this computer is gay. its good to hear that everyone is having an ace time. no severe illnesses yet but if i have to walk though any more monsoon flooded streets then i think my feet will fall off....so that pretty much garranteed. had a right laugh yesterday. i was taking a ride on a cycle-rickshaw ( the three wheel bikes here) when it started to piss it down. me and the driver were soaked from head to toe. after a while the driver got tired of dragging my fat arse around town, so he asks if i want to drive........of course i did!!! so i drive with the driver behind on the passengers street. i'm bombing down these pot-hole ridden streets which are rapidly flooding, with the driver craping himself, shouting at me to slow down, and with the by-standers all jeering. oh what larks. i'm in agra now, just by the way. saw the taj mahal today. it is amazing. off into rajistan tomorrow. i'm moving quickly only staying in a place for 1 or 2 nights as i plan to get to the south of india which may involve a 32 hr train journey. sweet. jordan - don't do drugs (i know your type away from home) josh and dan - get more birds (not that i can speak) al - save the world jamie - you just look after yourself, i'll be back soon to hold you again steelez - keep watch, you don't know the day nor the hour that the Lord will come twiggy, tom, kitty and to all other users.....be cool.

      Hello hello hello and welcome to you all. Myself and my nigger Josh awoke this morn in yet another sweaty pool and boarded das autobus from Hue. This didn't appeal at 8am but let me tell you, it was jolly good fun. We were sat behind an old Jap chap and his loverly wifette and well, he couldn't help himself but fart. Not in a sneaky public style, but a real lean-forward-lift-one-cheek-and-rasp stylee. Needless to say much chortling followed and not just from us. I almost cried when number two was released, and number three woke me from my slumberdom! And if that wasn't enough entertainment for one journey, Josh managed to get a gobbit deoderant foam into the wifette's hair and then whisper "bukkake". Oh the comedy.  And now we are arrived in Hoi An, and it's hotter than fuck. Gonna get some suits made tomorrow for an astronomical fee of 25 dollars. Cheap as chips ladies and gentlebeans, cheap as chips. That is if I last until tomorrow, as I am running out of sweat. Josh was wondering what the sour smell on the bus was, turns out it was me......need to wash some clothes prehaps.  Steelez, is there an order to your favorites list? When am I due? I will gladly send you a vial of my fetid sweat but I think I need it. Wait while I have a drink, then I'll send some.

      Glad to hear that everyone is having such an good time in the distant corners of the world, meanwhile in Newcastle:  Oh lackaday, what a surprise....It's pissing it down with rain and I've just stood on one of those wonky paving stones and soaked my pantaloons with litres of bog standard water. Balls. Add to that the fact that, despite the rain, it's really rather hot and I'm sweating like a gentleman of the desert. I'm currently searching for an abode and there look to be some very promising dwellings in the Fenham district of the city; cheap, cheerful and charming.  Josh, I managed to get into the house and posted all your mail. No I didn't really. Parky, send me a vial of your ball sweat. Al, I'm so glad I'm your favourite but you're not my favourite any more. Jordan, I now like you most. Tom, do they have weather in India? Jamie, I have loads of ciggies, I just wish you were here to help me smoke them. Nonnie, I have got my watch fixed at last. It is now nine minutes past four. Kitty, if all female flamingos are pink, what colour are the males?  Love to all and to all, love.

      Yea ah.....I like that. Al you are a funny lad, and a good lad. I shall call you a gunny lad. Yea ah. Alas no blue crush babes have been met. We came to the conclusion today that perhaps we are travelling round the world the wrong way, should have started in Nam and gone to Australia later, as I reckon its full of 'em now we've left. Shit 'ouse. Never mind.  Jamie, I will tell you Eian's emither address. Indeed I will. It goes a little something like this:  urlLink eianl77@hotmail.com   So you can be in charge, as administrator, of getting him involved. I predict he will be responsible for many an amusing blog. He is also a gunny lad, no?  Been spendin the day in the DMZ today, stooping round VC tunnels and being offered dog tags to buy as souvenirs. Not that keen on purchasing the remains of a dead soldier to be honest. So didn't. Aren't I a good lad.  Rightyrooooo, off for yet another bowl of noodles.......oooooooh what I wouldn't do for a pizza and a pint of John Smiths.....

      For the information of all the operatives still present in the Mighty Blighty:  Special Agent Lynch has requested assistance in a mission to locate Emily's new fella, we will refer to him as TERD FURGUSON for the time being, and determine if he qualifies for category S.A.L (sucks at life) or S.T.U.D. (sorry dude he’s cool and he’s gotta huge dong and is giving it to Em and she loves it and he’s a star athlete genius). In either case, mission objective is K.H.F.A. (kick his fuckin ass). Agent Purple can be contacted if need be.  Remember people, this is a covert mission, and we don't want to lose any men. Or women. Or animals. Go get them. But safety first, and be sure to wear a hat.

      Hello hello to one and all. Vietnam is very sweaty. My balls are stuck to my left thigh. Had to buy some talc yesterday, ooooh its so much better. Just been on a boat trip round some strange islands where everything is explained with fables of dragons, needless to say we didn't believe a word of what we were being told. Anyhooooo, got the night train to Hue tonight, hope the air con works or I fear we may die in a pool of fetid ball sweat.  Al, why are you in the USofA doing work? Is it for the government? Non, glad to hear the car is still alive  and kicking. Steelez, if you get the chance to take a pot shot at that cheesing ass poker, do it. Jamie, fix your Dads computer you very naughty boy. Jordan, where are you? Tommy, have you got leprosy yet? All others, ahoyhoy to you.  I have discovered a new drink, one which I shall probably not bother with again for it really isn't that great. Its called a dog's nose, and is a brutal coctail of beer and gin. Silly VC folks!!!  Thats all folks.

      Primarily ( I am about to become a solicitor, so I will no longer use colloquial terms such as firstly) I would like to address josh's question to twiggy about how the big chill went.  Addmitedly twiggy did go to the big chill, but he was not a member of the original big chill party.  The party was started by Hannah and I.  We were there the whole weekend as real chillers ( not a stinky steward like steelez (who basically was just a kill joy telling everyone to drink sensibaly and confiscating drinks off everyone(personally i think for his own consuption))).  Anyway - the BIG CHILL WAS GREAT!.  I HAD THE BEST TIME! i DANCED MET LOADS OF PEOPLE, AND (sorry didn't mean to shout#1) and also had a go on those awful day glow flyinging spinny things that people have at dance occasions! - They are acually lots of fun!  Anyway back to the non type new....  CURRENT DISASTERS!  1. Locked keys in car at service station on way to big chill 2. Right drive shaft collapsed on way from tea at twiggy's on way to big chill (cost £125 to repair) 3. Got lost on way to twiggy's to find car after big chill 4.  1.5 hours journey from big chill took 7 hours 5. Drove up to leeds to visit house in leeds (to find home- see previous rhyming-blog) only to find another person looking around at same time, equally as interested. 6.Realised I didn't have any other house to look around in leeds! 7.  Drove back from leeds only to find couldn't get in house because landlady had locked it with differednt lock. 8.  Got in car after finally finding way in to house (won't tell you how - knowing my lcuk this things tapped.) only to find it won't start.  WHICH ONE OF YOU FUCKER HAS BOUGHT A VOODOO DOLL  -beacue it din't work!!!  my car works and I got the house - wooo wibbly woo

      Deer friends (i'll bet you never knew I had friends who were deers huh),  I miss you all and discover at this time of solitary lab based disillusionment you guys are cool. I hope that the travelling is going well for the anchor travellers over there in the wei-jing (probably a word in some countries). Also to the three other, like myself, fringe travellers in you respective locations (except tom obviously who is an intrepid explorer) I bid you hello.  I have been here in America for almost a week now. Joshua and Daniel I am in rochester, minnesota at the Mayo clinic at the doing a wee projeat looking for the BRAF and its mutant friend in paediatric papillary (or papp ill ari as it sems to be called here) thyroid cancer. The hosptial/clinic is absolutely monstrous and is like a five star hotel. 2,100 consultants, 20,000 employees. The whole city revolves around medical staff or patients.   Please can everyone let me know the email address they are using.  I love you my five brothers in 4 countries.

      hey kids, i'm here and still alive. which is nice. i left delhi the day after i got there and came to varanasi. this is the place where people bathe in the river ganges on the steps. this is what occurs on the same river bank: bathing, clothes washing, drinking of water, praying, cows swiming, and the burning of dead bodies. i was also informed of groups of people who do not need to be burnt because they are already have 'pure karma' so these bodies are thrown straight into the river, these include people with small pox and leprosy!! however having an ace time. it is a proper adventure and difficult place to travel in. also already got some indian clobber. sweet. tomorrow i'm going to a town with lots of karma sutra temples...al'right good bye

        Why are boys so interested in bum sweat? It is Tom S's favourite topic of conversation and now Tom H talks of it as well.  Today we are going to see the biggest hole in the world at a copper mine. They have trucks which can carry 1000 tons and have wheels four times bigger than a person. I have never been excited at the prospect of a truck before.

      Hello again my dear friends. Some of you may remember last weekends' medics end of exams celebrations was officailly classed as a bender however the weekend just past has surpassed them all and now sits proud as the bender to beat all benders (don't look so worried josh you're not getting a beating).  The weekend began slowly with a mere piss up on friday to celebrate the anticlimax that is turning 23. Saturday began with a hangover which eventually passed leaving me and my ledbury crew to enjoy the festivity that is the godskitchen global gathering, 13 hours, 100 dj's and a small pharmacy later we arrived home, had a smoke up, got some valium down us and went 'kip. A furthur 6 hours later our free tickets gained us entry to the big chill, mushrooms were consumed and history allowed to take its course. The sun shined all weekend, steelez was located despite his best efforts to evade detection and the easy star allstars (over use of the word "star" in a name if you ask me) gave us a fine rendition of dub side of the moon to bring the evening to a close, mmmm. I had to be back at work in nottingham at 10 this morning, hence i feel like shit. over and out

      Good luck to you Tommy, may Vishnu guide you to safe lodgings and away from the temptation of those who would wish to take your money and enter your bowels. Keep us abreast of your movements by all means but I suspect that your soon to be all too frequent  bowel  movements can be taken as read. Unless of course you pass something that we all should hear about (and I don't mean elephants in the streets).  Snr Bowen, I understand that you yourself are soon to be going on some adventures of your own. Look forward to some Full Moon madness with you and your lady friends.  Jamie - try and keep Steelez under control whilst the others are away, you know how he likes to take advantage of our kindness. I checked the dates for Freshers' week and driver training starts on the 6th which I believe is a Monday. I'll be back on the Tuesday for that - I've made  special  arrangements with the crew for some personal tuition! Freshers' week starts officially on that Friday but I think all the fun starts the day before when all the youngsters arrive keen as mustard. I'll take 'em down a peg or two.  Amy - download the software from  urlLink www.ephpod.com . Hope you're adjusting to the real world without too much bother!!  Steelez - did you want your Thai wife with or without a penis? I can't remember what you told me.  Twiggy - How was El Grande Chill??  Tom S - Is Kitty behaving herself??  Kitty - Is Tom behaving herself??  I'm off to Bangkok on the morrow. I hope i live...
