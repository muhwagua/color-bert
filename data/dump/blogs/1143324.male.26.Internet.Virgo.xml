       IBM introduces masala  From  urlLink NewsFactor   IBM has unveiled Masala, a new database technology that boosts productivity by integrating corporate data from a wide array of sources. The system uses automated features and search technology to allow users to access and manage data from e-mails, spreadsheets, text files, voicemail and other sources using a single tool.       urlLink MASALA Q&A FROM IBM    What is Project Masala?  Project Masala is the next wave of IBM information integration capabilities being developed to help clients grapple with the issue of getting the most value out of their existing information assets.     What are we announcing?   Search is a fundamental capability within a company&rsquo;s information management infrastructure. Masala provides advanced search capabilities to be released this year in DB2 Information Integrator.   How does Masala search compare to internet search services?  Internet search services are concentrated on the needs of the consumer Internet market; whereas IBM is focused on the unique pain points of enterprise users who need to quickly find relevant corporate content.     What is the business problem we are trying to solve?  Businesses lose money when relevant business information is unavailable to employees. IBM is targeting the core issue of finding the right information, to the right people without the IT complexity of existing solutions.      How does Masala search relate to other search initiatives within IBM ?  WebSphere Portal provides basic search capabilities for Portal content. Masala adds broader content access, scaling to support larger implementations (500K+ documents), and is enabled for rich text analysis.     DB2 Content Manager Masala search provides native functionality to search both rich text documents and metadata for files stored in DB2 Content Manager along with other enterprise content.   DB2 Net Search Extender provides high-speed, scalable, integrated full-text search capabilities to DB2 Universal Database. Masala provides search for text documents stored in DB2 Universal Database and other enterprise data sources.    How is Masala search related to WebFountain?   Masala and WebFountain share technologies but serve different needs. WebFountain is a hosted solution focused on advanced analytics for the internet, while Masala provides search and analytics capabilities for enterprise content.

Indian educational institutes are already showing the initiative by incorporating the opensource in the syllabus, the students are also encouraged to take up opensource projects. On top of it, Indian government and large institutions like banks, etc have started recognizing opensource in their official IT Tenders. The only thing which is required is to change the attitude towards the opensource ... " Opensource is not cheap alternative, It is  the serious   alternative".

        Why do we blog ?.     My own reasons, I may be wrong but I have the right to speak.    Not so serious reasons:-    1) Because we all like to talk and what's better than talking... and listening to the same again and again and making it immortal on some web page.  2) By blogging we want to confirm that we are superior and not so really idiot like every other idiot except me.  3) The HTML exists, the web exists, browsers come by default, internet access is cheap, blogging sites are free, office time is free, mind is also free... and so and on.   some other rare reasons :   1) It's a killer knowledge tool. 2) Generate great thoughts 3) It confirms the thought of like-minded people. 4) There are "very few" good people on this earth who should really speak but media like films, television and now even newspapers are more about " blood, boobs and butts". But heay ! you can meet these people on the net, blogging. 5) It is a harmless, peaceful and most constructive method of expression. 6) It's simple, sexy and cool.

       Psychometric or Behavioural Assessment  The conventional method of recruitment process is more of a technical process and does not give any assessment of the candidate from the psychic point of view. That is you cannot judge whether a person who claims to be a very patient person is really patient, a candidate claiming to be friendly is really friendly and a person claiming to be team player is really a team player. To overcome the shortfall of the traditional recruitment process the latest buzzword found is : PSYCHOMETRIC or BEHAVIOURIAL testing. Comapnies like Microsoft, Texas Instruments, Dell, GE, AOL, Siemens are all implementing these tests in their recruitment process. Mr. Murlidhar S, director of  urlLink MeritTrac , a comptency assessment company says that, "Psychometric assessment completes the selection process along with the ability and skills/knowledge tests. This is the current buzz in the BPO industry, where the call agent has to demonstrate a great deal of patience & empathy while handling a customer call." The emphasis in now given on the 'emotional intelligence' and candidates are now being evaluated for their 'real' personality characteristics, interpersonal style and job specific aptitude.   But what about companies using the buzz words 'equal opportunity employer', 'annual assessment', 'annual appraisals', 'performace linked incentives', 'healthy environment' etc. etc. Think about it.

        MOBY ON FUNDAMENTALISM      Fundamentalism (of any kind) troubles me. The world is too big and too intricate to conform to our ideas of what it should be like. In my experience I've found that most fundamentalists aren't so much attached to their professed ideologies as they are to the way in which these ideologies try to make sense of a confusing world. But the world is confusing, and just because we invent myths and theories to explain away the chaos we're still going to live in a world that's older and more complicated than we'll ever understand. So many religious and political and scientific and social systems fail in that they try to impose a rigid structure onto what is an inherently ambiguous world. I'm not suggesting that we stop trying to understand things. Trying to understand the world can be fun and, at times, helpful. But if we base our belief systems on the humble assumption that the complexities of the world are ontologically beyond our understanding, then maybe our belief systems will make more sense and end up causing less suffering.  urlLink MOBY        urlLink MOBY  is a world renowned Techno musician, the same man behind that famous MISSION IMPOSSIBLE theme music. He is a vegeterian by choice and maintains great essays and article about god, religion, fundamentalism, intolerance & humantiy that you MUST READ.

       US REWARDS PAKISTAN FOR CONTINUING TERRORISM IN INDIA  Pakistan has publically acknowledged that their influence exists on the the terroists activities in India. President Bush, the democratically elected president has been casually asking the dictator of Pakistan to resolve the Pakistan-India-Kashmir issue and stop the terrorism. But recently since the Pakistan has contributed and helped US target Al-Qaida and US's millitary effort in Afgahanistan. Though it might be a different issue that this was as pathetic as recent "Gulf War" because Laden is not found Saddam is not found. WAR for US is a big business, it won't be surprise to find out that US had fought these war only for the sake of "rest of the world". Laden and Saddam may be enjoying the life somewhere funded by US, the solution is simple... if somebody becomes uncomfortable to the public eye, say that you are killing him and hide him. Am I talking like a idiot, if you know that how JFK was asassinated and for which cause, you will find that I am just putting forward a very possible thing. Coming back to the issue, Read    urlLink Editorial : Significant US package for Musharraf ' s Pakistan - Daily Times,   urlLink US may repair, upgrade Pak's F-16s  - Times of India.  What very pious and ignorant Musharraf is offering:  urlLink No guarantee on stopping infiltration in India  and  urlLink advice  to USA. And our great Indian Prime Minister is planning to send Indian Troops to Iraq, the result as predicted by me : Pat on (pakistan's) back, grant to pakistan, advice to India and small mention for the martyr soldiers somewhere where it would be as good as invisible. Bravo India, bravo...

        LINUX & OPENSOURCE NEWS UPDATES     Intellectual-property expert Richard Wilder says the liability issues raised by SCO's Linux lawsuit will force distributors and developers to rethink assumptions about open-source software, IP rights and customer protection. urlLink >Read Open Source Time of Truth     In an aggressive move that could have a profound effect on open-source software and the Unix arena, The SCO Group—which owns rights to Unix—has issued a warning that Linux is an unauthorized derivative of Unix. The company also says that users of Linux may face legal liability. urlLink  Read More    The above stance of SCO drew the wrath of the Open Source Initiative (OSI), as shown in a paper online at  urlLink www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html . OSI's argument is that the lineage of Unix variants extends in directions beyond what SCO owns the rights to. The paper contends: "We wrote our Unix and Linux code as a gift and an expression of art. We did not write it to have it appropriated by men so dishonorable that after making a profit from our gift for eight years they could insult our competence."    UK Govt warned  urlLink  Dont Buy GPL     SCO  urlLink says  : It has revoved IBM's licence for UNIX.

      ci  INDIAN SOLDIERS COMES VERY CHEAP FOR USA  Since  urlLink British troops are getting killed in Iraq  our Indian government is planning that India should also join them. Indian soldiers should also get killed for the cause. It is a very little surprise that just before the war House had resolved against the war, the same is pointed out by the opposition party  urlLink "Troops to Iraq to violate House resolution: Opp" . VP Singh and Gujral whos political career only allows them to pass comments are also  urlLink against sending the troops to Iraq . And what's the bargain?-   urlLink India could seek berth in G8 for sending troops to Iraq . Ofcourse, the quickgun BJP is taking the mileage out of it by yelling the slogan  urlLink "Strong India" . The conclusion...the blood of Indian soldiers is cheap, they died in Kargil, they are dying on LOC and now they will die in Iraq. What's the difference, if we were against the WAR initially... can't we do this small thing for President Bush.    Lets join  urlLink "THE WMD CULT"

        TAJ MAHAL IS DYING   urlLink TAJ MAHAL   may die very soon because some smart asses in the government of India thought that visitors & tourists of TAJ desperately needed some shopping, eating and entertainment experience around Taj Mahal which is such a dull and useless place. How about Mc Donald's or Pizza Hut right next to Taj? or having the wonderful experience of buying your Jockey underwears in front of Taj? How exiting?. Actually these brilliant asses might have thought of having this all "inside" the Taj, but some idiots around the world call it "HERITAGE" site and consider it as some kind of "WONDER". Otherwise you could have bhajiyas & samosas along with coke and pepsi inside Taj. Instead of you having the memories of Taj, Taj would have your farts and burrps as your memories. But any way... the brilliant plan was then modified and constructed "around" Taj. Now you will be able to see some real good concrete beauty around Taj, the mix and match of HERITAGE &  and NEW AGE NUISANCE. This construction work is supposed to be going on since November 2002 or May 03 can't say for sure, .... but since Taj is a heritage site nobody noticed it (IGNORANCE IS BLISS!), neither UP Chief Minister nor the central government (?). The construction plan was started without discussing with environment minsitry and acheological department (AMAZING, AS WONDERFUL AS TAJ ITSELF). When these BUSY (?) CENTRAL GOVT.  was shown the work around Taj, the so called heritage structure, they took the very quick step of  urlLink stopping the construction work  In  urlLink Aaj Tak  TV news presentations one of the govt. official only admitted that since some construction, a kind of dam like thing whcih will increase the flow of YAMUNA river towards TAJ MAHAL.   urlLink TAJ MAHAL   was built by Mogul Emperor Shah Jahan as a monument to his love for his favorite wife, Mumtazmahal, who died while giving birth to their 14th child. An army of 20,000 stone masons, gem cutters, marble fitters and laborers toiled for 22 years to build the stunning white-marble monument. .   THE BRILLIANT PROJECT  The tourism complex would be a 2-kilometer (1.25-mile) corridor filled with shopping malls, amusement parks and restaurants on the banks of the Yamuna River which flows behind the Taj. The development would stand just 300 meters (330 yards) from the world-famous monument.    BRAVO! OOPS WE DID IT AGAIN Jagmohan told the Indian Express that permission had not been obtained from his ministry, which is responsible for the upkeep of historical monuments. He said the project violated India's Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958.    It is not clear which government department approved the 1.75 billion rupee (US$40 million) project.  CLAP CLAP CLAP. India is such a large country with so many listed and not listed so called heritage sites that these kind of things can happen. And where politicians are busy in pure and pious politics and beaurocrats are busy in tieing the shoe laces of politicians (YES IT HAPPENS IN UP, IN A RECENT FLIGHT IAS OFFICERS HELPED MAYAWATI AND KANSHIRAM TIE THEIR SHOE LACES, THE HERTIAGE CONTINUES) it is not very surprising that they will  urlLink  now probing  in to the matter.  DON't MISS THE LAST CHANCE TO  urlLink SEE TAJ MAHAL , CLICK NOW. ABSOLUTELY FREE.     GOD BLESS INDIA (FROM INDIANS).   PAKISTAN WE DON'T NEED YOU, WE ARE CAPABLE ENOUGH TO DESTROY OUR OWN COUNTRY.

        Film on CHILD LABOUR by children wins UK award.  RABIA a seven year old (future of India according to Congress, BJP and rest of the politicians of India) has a little time to enjoy life beacause the future of India is busy in picking rags at the garbage dumps near Rohini in capital of India where the black present of India lies. Rabia is not just the bread winner but she also has to do all the household chorees and look after her ailing family members; paralysed mother, asthmatic father, sister suffering from a skin disease and contantly ill two brothers. THE FUTURE OF INDIA IS VERY COLOURFUL. RASHTRABHASHA HINDI MEIN : BHARAT KA BHAVISHYA KAAFI RANGIN HAI. In Hindi, since I didn't want to upset our young and energetic Prime Minister. Rabia is captured on film by children, who have had equally difficult lives. It is truly inspiring and touching. These four CREATIVE children guided by few adults and producers as children's organization PLAN INTERNATIONAL. won critical acclaim and the Special achievemt Award at the annual media awards function, organized by the London based ONE WORLD BROADCATING TRUST. set up by BBC and ITV.  INDIAN FILMs & TV people should learn something from this and try to become honest with their profession. Majority (more than 99%) of Indian Films and TV do not depict Indian and Indians of today. Mr. Naseeruddin Shah rightly said once that "say after 20 years if we wanted to show our kids what was India and how were Indians in our (this) time, we will have NOTHING to show". Think About It.

        Upset with USA   Thomas L Friedman offered "brief theory of everything" about why so many people are upset with America. His thesis : America  has begun to touch other people's lives more than their own goverments do and therefore people all over the world want to be able to vote on American power. He invited readers to to email their opinions and recieved over 8,000 e-mail messages. According to him two themes stood out : (1) People are now interested in foreign policy in the wake of 9/11 & Iraq and (2) People are worried  about how alienated America is becoming from the world, blaming Bush and the world and feeling that something important is being lost.  The summary of the messages which he recieved:    USA has been the beacon of hope past half a century to the disfranchised, thw wounded, the the refugees" ( we have now lost the hope now)  USA now was a Fair Arbiter of the World, The world doesn't wan't to see USA morph into just another imperial power   Many of us in the world are frightened by the unproposed power of an Administration that has total disregard for those who disagree with it and threatens the future of this world with its indifference to anything outside it's own plans...    READ MY LIPS  : For better or for worse the world is a buch of petulant teenagers that now think of us (the US) as the parent. They want our protection, our comfort (ourfinancial suport). They want us out of their rooms while keeping them tidy, freedom to mock us but come to us hwn they have problems... Most of all, they want no resposibility for their own behaviour. We should understand them.'Bout cover it? Only answer is for kids to grow up, realise parents don't have all the answers and are, at best, imperfect being themselves."  World are your listening?, India are you listening?, Mr. vajpayee are your listening?. Think About It.

        LINUX NEWS UPDATES    urlLink RED HAT 's earning meets   urlLink  expectations and  urlLink FORBES  points the  urlLink limitations  of LINUX. RED HAT had a 10% increase in the growth in the Enterprise segment compared to previous year. On the other hand the second story of "limitations" points our that LINUX may be overhyped and "not a lot of depth" in some areas. The TCO total cost of ownership is also discovered to be high compared to other OS.The story ends with a note that   "So, in the end, this is what we know: Linux is here to stay; it will get better; and sometimes it's cheaper than alternatives, but it's not right for every application. We know the very same about Windows."    Keep the track of the RED HAT (nasdaq :  urlLink  RHAT ,  urlLink NEWS ,  urlLink PEOPLE )   Whatever might be the speculations,  urlLink LINUX  has proved that it is a Killer OS and it will continue to do so with the power of  urlLink OPEN SOURCE . The good news ofcourse is that  urlLink LINUS TORVALDS   urlLink is cocentrating again on LINUX development .Let's also hope that  urlLink SCO Vs IBM  legal battle doesn't hurt LINUX. Opensource will ofcourse win the WAR "openly".

I am speechless how stupid and blind can  the Indian Politics and Beurocracy can become. The Central Pollution Control  Board is fuming over the matter since the construction began last November under  the aegis of the National Project Construction Corporation (NPCC) without any  environmental assessment of its impact on the TAJ MAHAL.

       MUMBAI SLUMS  New York based journalist ROBERT NEUWIRTH is writing a book on slum life in four countries, and has come to Mumbai and staying in slum to feel the “slum life”. According to him the common things in squatters all over the world, are High Crime Rates, Congestion, Battle For Cleanliness, Neglected Kids and Refusal to the resident to move out. In Mumbai he is co-ordinating with NGO  Nivara Hakk  and he has observed that “Free houses is not the solution to rehabilitate them. A family of 8 living in 225 sq. ft. house is again a slum. We need to harness the energy of this people to make the building plans which are economically viable, while the government should only focus on the infrastructure."

        SRISTI   urlLink SRISTI  is a non-governmental organisation setup to strengthen the creativity of grassroots inventors, innovators and ecopreneurs engaged in conserving biodiversity and developing eco-friendly solutions to local problems   Honey Bee Network   urlLink Honey Bee Network  brings together those creative and innovative farmers, artisans, mechanics, fishermen and women and labourers who have solved a problem through their own genius without any outside help whether from state, market, or even NGOs. Such self triggered and developed innovations whether technological or institutional are scouted, supported, sustained and scaled wherever possible with or without value addition, linkage with formal science and technology. Idea is to generate incentives and benefits for the innovators. The innovations could be developed by individuals or groups. These may have been developed in recent past or long past and some times these innovations or creative practices might have become part of traditional knowledge. We thus also look for outstanding examples of traditional knowledge, which help in conserving and utilizing natural resources in a sustainable manner.    Why you should join the Honey Bee network .  - If you feel totally dissatisfied with the current mode of dominant mediocrity all around us  - If you feel that lots of poor people are so poor not because they can not think, but - because their ideas and initiatives do not get space for expansion and fulfillment  - If you think that there are many dreams that you had which you could not fulfill in your - life but would like others to fulfill them sooner rather than later  - If you want to invest in green ideas which involve risk but may help society as well as our lives if successful  - If you want to contribute some of your time ( ranging from one day in a month or a year to one hour a day to may be few weeks a year or more) in service of grassroots innovators by contributing towards a skill and resource bank. This bank will be accessible to knowledge rich but economically poor or disadvantaged farmers, artisans, pastoralist, or urban slum dwellers having ideas or prototype of new product or service or any other inventors.  - If you yourself have some innovative green idea and do not know who to contact for making it grow, generate wealth and make this world greener, fairer and more humane  - If you are a scientist or technologist and can pursue research yourself or guide your students to add value in local knowledge and innovations  - If you are an entrepreneur who wants to scale up some other innovator's innovation  - If you are a policy maker who no more enjoys stifling initiative of others and instead enjoys helping others grow  - If you are a teacher who can persuade your students to take pride in augmenting grassroots innovations and help liberate the colonized minds of the elite    Note : All the content is from SRISTI.org. I have just provided the information for interesting the user to visit the site. Please visit the sristi site and contribute, it's mind boggling what these people are doing. It's kind of Open Source Innovation on fire, by the people, for the people and of the people.

        Why am I blogging all this   From now onwards I am stepping down from being a critic. I am planning to write only inspirational and wonderful things in the life and little bit of my pessimistic poems. Cos' I have remembered Del Carnegie - "Nobody wins an arguement". I think I should stop my itch of being a new kid on the blog and concentrate on beautiful things in the life and not get deviated by  the botherations. So Mr. Bush, Mr. Musharraf and Mr. Vajpayee Ji I am taking a leave from you (oops I did it again). What I am trying to say that instead of saying "war" i would say "peace". I want peace of myself also, but this world and google news and the morning paper and the latest news channels keep me bothering. I want an escape. Why there is no button on us humans called "Esc?", which we would have liked to press again and again to come out of filthy politics and their wars. (oops I did it again).   Am I Blogging or am I getting crazy.  Think About It (This is for myself)

        What is benefecial for India and Pakistan  Everything from origin to food habbits, culture, language & passion for cricket... is similar between India and Pakistan. Yet it is very unfortunate that these two countries share this very awkward postion of enemity. What we can do is to extend our tieups in culture, economics, intellect and business and get benefitted. Both the countries can forget their past and become a great example for the rest of the world. I am sure the political thought and the thoughts of the citizens are surely very different of this issue. If there would have been a difference... Indian pictures won't be hit in Pakistan even after a ban (with piracy ofcourse) and Indians wouldn't love Pakistani cricketers, writers and singger who come and perform in India very often. Whatever difference between these countries exists, are all born out of politics and due to political mistakes committed in the past and their continuation in the present. The essence, the blood and the soil of these two countries is very much the same. Instead of becoming a combined strong force in the asian region we are instead becoming a bad example and allowing other countries... who are least bothered for both of us ... gain an advantage and become our guide or suporter. Do we need an external support to solve "our" matters.? No, but we surely need a political will to do that. Citizens of these nations have nothing great against each other, but there is nobody to listen. We can vote for leadership but we cannot vote for what we want. WE WANT PEACE - A petition from both the sides. I hope somebody is listening. Think About It.

        The option for Kashmir   [  "It is said that the purpose of repeated extensions of one-sided ceasefire by India is that after the Jehad is stopped, Vajpai is considering the possibility to open talks with Pakistan. Talking is of course better than fighting. But has any Indian leader courage to face the truth? This is an age of democracy. Will any Indian leader be ready to allow Kashmiris to decide their fate by their own free will? Every Indian leader is afraid of the result of such a free plebiscite. They all know it well that, in such a case, Kashmir will no more remain a part of India. Due to this fear, India, like Israel, is not ready to implement UN Resolutions on Kashmir."    ]   urlLink  Read More   By Jehadi - Hussain Khan M.A. (Tokyo)  My derivation from the above article - Pakistan will form a better goverment than India and it will be a better democracy(???) - Kashmiris won't mind getting called - "Muhajirs"="Refugees". - In india Muslims are third grade citizens like Amir Khan, Shahrukh Khan, President Abdul Kalam, etc. etc. - There are many muslims in UP, MP and Bihar so they should also ask for seperate state or country like kashmir, since he points that it was basis of India-Pakistan partition. - Pakistan is such a great wonderful nation that "all" the kashmiris are dying to be under there rule or parentship. - If Kashmir becomes a seperate nation the most supportive partner will be Pakistan. - If politician don't listen what Jehadi's can do. The only option they have is to kill the innocent people. But Jehad is more important.  With due respect to Mr. Hussein, since he has more authority on this subject I can say something is surely wrong from both the sides. But we don't need a "slogan to inspire killing" we need solution. And that solution is surely not from Pakistan. Period.

        Friendly(?) Neighbor Pakistan's accusition.  Our friendly(?) neighbor PAKISTAN asks us (India) to -  urlLink Resume unconditional talks  and accuses India for the delay in commencement of peace talks between the two countries.   Claiming that the Pakistani leadership has been "very constructive, forward looking and positive in their approach towards resumption of dialogue", he said, "unfortunately, we haven't seen the same sort of tone from Indian leadership".   What these guys are upto only they know. Just yesterday it was again voiced by Mr. George Fernandes, the Defence Minister that, Pakistan has not yet stopped it's terrorits activities and sending of trained terrorists in India. I think for Pakistan   Construction= Terrorist Training,  Forward looking = updating the innocent Indian's body count, and Dialogue = Continuing bloodshed.   Pakistan should consider introducing "construction" in their own country and start thinking about the development work in their country. I hope pakistani people must be also tired of this Kashmir Issue and fundamentalism. What they must be also wanting is Peace, Education, Jobs and Happiness. Pakistan by fuelling terrorism in India will find itself nowhere, personal growth  and fertility of their own soild must be more important to them than winning Kashmir, a heaven which they have turned into hell.

Before spelling WAR and WMD, please SPELL "Life, Humanity, Innocent Civilians, Peace, Soldiers who die for a cause(?) & many more things".  Don't comment if you are not in it, it's not same as watching "Saving Private Ryan" and start verbal farting about it.

       Challenging Linux ???   urlLink Utah firm's suit against IBM could deal a blow to operating system     SCO Group, a small company in Utah that owns rights to Unix. SCO has licensed its Unix to IBM and many other firms. Now SCO is suing IBM, claiming IBM's been taking SCO's intellectual property and plugging it into Linux -- a sort of binary plagiarism  A shocking thing to learn when you have already been in so much love of the cute TUX. But I think people should find the way out of this. If this is true then it is yet other adulteration of the "big corporate"... their strategy of ruining the good things and if it's not true, then the penguin is raring to go ahead. But can we take precaution against these kind of things?, no we can't. This world has come close but soemtime we may miss our own skin. These things will continue to bother for ever, till the spirit of the people is not open.

        Oliver Stone = Controversial Cinema = Uncomfortable Truth    urlLink  Oliver Stone   is the father of cult "controversial cinema", anybody would introduce Stone like this only. Yesterday I was watching "Born on 4th Of July" on HBO, and I confirmed my belief again. Stone makes very gripping, fast, honest, blunt and "Slap on your face" kind of movies. He is the director who streches not only his stories, but dialogues, characters and situation to the maximum limit. He is voracious and mercy less story teller. Remember... in JFK the single shot of "JFK hit by bullet" was shown hundred times and each time with more pain and cinematic brilliance. He rips apart whatever is good or bad inside a person he doesn't differetiate between people as good or bad, in his movies most of the time character changes with situation, and that's the beauty of it. He makes a honest cinema which is highly uncomfortable for us to see, because truth cannot be comfortable. His characters are always seeking the truth for themselves and the world they are living in.. be it Charlie Sheen in "Wall Street", Val Kilmer in "The Doors", Cruise in "Born on 4th of July" or Kevin Costner in "JFK". Simply said he makes "Uncomfortable Cinema" as in Truth and Life.

        CAS- unConditional Access Sytem ???  The country which must be dealing with the friendly(?) neighbors, education, basic healthcare & many more things, is actually dealing with the debate over  urlLink CAS  - Conditional Access Systems. The priorities are strange and unknown but the implementation is immediate. What customer is gaining is choice & freedom (which is not actually available). The customer will end up paying more and is the direct bearer of its implementation since the set top box is at customer's expense. You cannot switch to another cable operator with the same box, you cannot decide what will be FTA - Free To Air for you since it will depend on the geography. So if you are south indian residing in UP, the southern free channels may not be there for you. The prices of individual channels are not yet declared since they are available in buckets only. The broadcaster are themselves confused to declare firmly that they will go for "paid" one since they are very much doubtful over the advertising revenue they are going to miss in the initial period & other teething problems to be faced. But the Indian Goverment has declared a holistic date "14th of July" for the metro implementation.  Think About it.

        The painful thing called life.  Life is pain Pain flows through pen And becomes poetry Is there no difference between blood & ink? No, as there is no difference between skin & paper Both are cheap Blood on screen is entertaining Somebody else’s pain on paper is entertaining It only hurts when your skin becomes paper And somebody else is reciting your pain That’s the rule of the game That’s how the pain industry works Aren’t there beautiful words in any poetry? Yes, they are. So What? Have you ever seen that kind of beauty in life? As found in so called beautiful poems Beauty is distraction A short high and a long hangover So my dear friend Whoever witnesses beauty in life  Has to find himself punished by an ugly hangover for the entire life. Then he becomes a serial poet &  Remembers beauty (so called optimistic poems) And confirms pain (what exists, so called pessimism) The choice is yours The words are yours But the truth is very much same Beauty is remembered & pain is confirmed. Life is beautiful. Really? Go find yourself a life first. Go find yourself a life first. Till that time Life was beautiful. Now it sucks. Period.

        US trying to find a reason for war, after the war  Little bit confusing isn’t it. So what US soldiers were lying idle, they wanted some exercise can’t they kill few people here & there? Is it a great problem that USA is unable to find the weapons of mass destruction  urlLink (WMD) ? The conspiracy theorists now say that the deposed ruler  urlLink  Saddam Hussein   had “dual use” facilities. US defense secretary  urlLink  Donald Rumsfeld   said Iraq had dual facilities “capable of instant delivery of such weapons of mass destruction while normally producing products for peaceful uses.” On the other hand  Senator Joseph Biden , a high ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee said “such weapons may have existed but the  urlLink Bush  administration hyped the claims.”    Please (also) note:   No Iraqi citizens was killed in the Iraq war. Even if some were killed then the body count is shamefully negligible to admit.  Only the buildings which were vacant were bombarded. The reason behind the vacant buildings are quite obvious.   (a) Iraqis were dancing over the news of defeated Saddam  (b) Or giving interviews to western media about how friendly the US soldiers are and how they are thankful to Bush for restoring peace & democracy. (c) Rest of the Iraqis were busy raiding the shops and the banks during happy hours and were having the complete entertainment and fun by enjoying the loot.

       Pak admits influence over militants entering India    The extra hoily, pious and peaceful Pakistan has finally acknowledged "influence" over terrorists who go across its border into India, compared them to desperate Palestinian suicide bombers, but pleaded complete inability to "rub an Alladin’s lamp" and stop cross-border "martyrdom".

THE MATRIX QUOTES :  ----------------------------  Morpheus: Do you believe in fate, Neo?   Neo: No.   Morpheus: Why not?   Neo: Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.    ----------------------------------   Neo: This isn't real?   Morpheus: What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.    ----------------------------------   Morpheus: How did I beat you?   Neo: You -- You're too fast.   Morpheus: Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place? Do you believe that's air you are breathing now? If you can free your mind, the body will follow.     ----------------------------------   Morpheus: Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream, Neo? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?     ----------------------------------     WHAT IS THE MATRIX ?

        The Suicidal Mind    The one common characteristic of almost all suicides, according to Edwin Shneidman, reagarded  as the father of suicide prevention in America, is that they’re caused by pain, a certain kind of psychological pain he calls psychache (sik-ak). “Further-more,” he adds, “this psychahe stems from thwarted or distorted psychological needs.”  The suicide is a very complex and strange phenomenon it is an last stage of ‘clinical depression’. I have used the world ‘clinical depression’ which has certain base for it, because nowadays due to the sedentary or hectic lifestyle nobody is without depression. The ‘clinical depression’ can be very short and impulsive or very chronic one. Sometimes the ‘person’ discusses his problems with his close ones, but as the decision to do the ‘suicide’ nears it becomes very difficult to recognize him/her or sometimes it’s so impulsive that nobody gets a chance to recognize. But the main reason behind the suicide is the unbearable and the highly painful & uncomfortable situation in which the person find himself trapped without anywhere to go. Suicide is not a option which is ‘chosen’ it is an event which ‘happens’.   The logical mind can argue that there would have been other options, but the pain at that instant orders that ‘it’ should be executed.  The fact points that there are various familial and genetic reasons which contribute to the risk of suicidal behaviour. That does not mean that all the people with these background commit suicide, it simply points that the chances of committing suicide are more is these cases. They should create a proper support system for themselves and remove all the ‘negative’ from the inside. Prevention is better than cure, any kind of mental depression and any thought of ‘loss of interest in life’ and ‘tendency to commit suicide’ should be clinically treated. The chance of thought becoming a plan or action is very much possible and takes no time in taking the final shape and becoming the event. We treat our bodies and visit doctor for small ailments like cold and aches, but days of boredom, confusion, anger, frustration and depression is simply ignored. The mind is at times is self healing but not auto-flushable, the things accumulate inside the brain as memory and tendencies become habbits and then the fixed quality or attribute of the person. And the pain caused by mind is more unbearable than the pain which is caused by body.   Think About It!

        Pakistan is agenda for India’s PM or India should be his agenda    Indian prime minister Shri. Lal Bihari Vajpai wants to add a very big feather in his cap, a feather of winning peace talks with Pakistan at any cost. The cost can be loosing sight of problems within the country and ignoring more important To Do’s in the list which are more important for the growth of the nation. The result is running the ‘Delhi-Lahore’ bus which resulted in ‘Kargil War’ last time. The nation has also shamefully forgotten the ‘Kargil’ incident since it was busy in seeing the cricket matches during the kargil. I seriously wonder and pray what would be the result this time. India is a very tolerant nation and recognized as a peace keeper in the region by the entire world. But we are not really campaigning hard for the cause, we are campaigning as if it is just another problem of the nation and Pakistan is just ‘teasing’ us. Terrorism is a serious offence and there has to be serious effort punishment for that by us and by all the so called peaceful nations.  India’s peace is not in the world agenda. If tomorrow the USA decide to extend the Pakistan support by fighting with India, the world and its UNOs will be just the witnesses as they were in very recent ‘Iraq’ war. USA will never do such thing however, because the grand daddy is smart and will enjoy the important status from both the sides but will never make a serious effort if Indian and Pakistan are not ready to recognize the good deeds of USA and declare USA as “Official Peace Keeping Parent.”  Indian politician and even Indian citizens are engaged in full time filthy politics and not in the more important social and economical issues. The boring and routine TV serials are compensated by spiced up ‘Television News Channel’ (There are more new channels than the news itself). And the stars of these channels are politcians who have only and only politics in their agenda, the Vajpais, the Advanis, the Sonias, the Laools, the Rabris, the Thackreys, the Lalitas, and so on.   The disinvestment plan is gathering dust. The disinvestment of Hindustan petroleum and Bharat Petroleum was supposed to fetch the government Rs 10,265 croers and may be even more if executed properly. Similarly Air India and Indian Airlines is out of the disinvestment plans. The VAT is also swinging here and there and there is lack of political willingness to implement it. There are lots of Women Issues, Labour Reforms, Education & Social reforms. But the parliament is more interested in fighting than passing the bills and updating the laws.  The population is plenty that’s why we are not worried by the body counts of our soldiers and citizens. We can feed Pakistan and many others for years to come and we will keep on waiting for them to stop and then talk, till that time they can continue what they are doing.  Think About It!

        The rising   Criminal Tendencies   in youth.   In the past people with a “bad” backgrounds used to enter into the criminal world. There used to be a   certain   reason behind the decision to go for crime. The crime used to be for some reason either social, economical or mental. But today the youth with pretty well family background, social and economical status and highly educated background is entering the crime scene. Crime is becoming   fashionable   . One of the example recently is Gurprit Singh (Miki) who executed Aijaj Lakdawala last week in Bangkok. Miki hailed from a good family background and was a graduate from college in Andheri, Mumbai. The worst example exists and they are more dangerous are harmful as in “Terrorism”. In the recent serial bombing incidents in Mumbai the involvement of qualified graduate and post graduate qualified youth in more alarming. The “Lashkar” aria commander Abu Sultan was a masters in computer science.. Dr. Matin involved in Ghatkopar bombing incident is MD in forensic medicine.  Atif Mullah involved in involved in Mulund bombing incident is a holder of MBA degree.  The inclusion of these so called mature, sophisticated and educated criminals in making the crime and terrorism even more complex. These people use the latest in the technology, & are easily deceptive because of good social background and very smart in defending themselves compared to easily recognizable criminals who act, walk and talk like criminals. The reason for their criminal inclination is unknown, somehow crime is becoming fashionable and addictive (hard to resist) like drugs. The latest fad among the upper circle youth in the country’s capital Delhi is to steal the new cars, tear them apart and sell off their parts just for that extra heavy pocket money. Somewhere the social structure is breaking apart, the schools, the colleges, the society, the friends and the family is not acting as qualified support system. The individualism is becoming more important and an individual is deciding for himself what is “Right/Wrong” for himself and living by his own rule book. For some people even this reason is not applicable, they become what they want to, there is no reason, why? May be everybody is loosing the “respect and fear” factor related to the Law & Order. Only the good ones fear and respect the law, because they know that they will end in the long trap. The bad ones, who have decided to go wrong have nothing to fear since they know that by the time they will get punishment, they would have already had the party.  Think About It!

       Indian Mobile Telecom Subscriber Base   Geneva based International Telecommunication Union (ITU) study and figures reveal that India is one of the fasted growing large mobile markets in the world, jumping from 33rd position to 18th position between 2002 & 2003.   If India continues to show this trend (thanks to competetion between Reliance, Tata, Hutch, Airtel, BPL & others) and same growth in both GSM & CDMA based mobile services it is sure that India would rank amongst the top 10. This is supported by the fact that right now there are 17.22 million (GSM + CDMA)subsribers, growing healthily at the rate of 80% per year. That amounts to 25-30 million subscribers by march, 2004.    India is however already made to 5th position in the fixed lines with 41.2 million subscribers.

In the latest issue of the Business World she has written worderful article on internet email scam appropriately titled "BEWARE! NIGERIA CALLING". If you are on the internet and have even a single pathetic email id, you must be already aware about this phenomenon. Some smat ass in Niegeria has loads of money which he wants to save from his government due to various political, military and civic reasons. And god knows why you are the choosen one?, the lord of the ring. He wants you to become the medium to transfer his millions and get cool 3/4 million for yourself. Now like myself and lot's of other have deleted these types of mails right away and flushed the trash. But there are many air heads in this world who really felt that they are really the choosen ones. Don't think that the story ends here and this mail things end after making you virtual april fool. These things go beyond the net and after series of mail exchanges you are duped to the tune of few thousand dollars and may be worst than that which is still unknown to us. It has become the multi-million dollar business(?).

       LINUX TORVALDS : The Coolest One / Hot Inside  Stephen Shankland of CNET NEWS  urlLink interview  LINUS TORVALDS. The interview covers the questions related to the SCO lawsuit, his new job at OSDL & his views on Linux. Linus Torvalds seems to be cool in his reactions but actually he may not be very pleased to witness these kind of issues happening with LINUX. His answers on the patent issue raised by SCO on IBM which is affecting LINUX....   "Finding patent infringement has always been a responsibility of the patent holders. I didn't put it there...It is a fact that I do not encourage engineers to look up patent information, for example. You ask any lawyer about it, and they will tell you that I'm right. It's not the job of an engineer to try to find out about other peoples patents, since that just taints them, exactly something you do not want to happen."   Ofcoure, Linux has great a great shape over the years and many open source are running into the blood of mainstream IT and Business sector. Innovative programmers and visionaries like LINUS must be really upset over the issue since in certain ways it is affecting the opensource and the linux community.

        CONCERNS : Humans vs. Robots vs. Cyborgs vs. Humans  My entire point of writing  urlLink Humans vs. Robots vs. Cyborgs vs. Humans  was my concern towards the issue since I was shocked by the possibilities. I quickly updated my thoughts on my blog, but then I asked myself this whole issue must be a within many people's mind. I tried searching the net and I was guilty that there are many people who had better views to offer than mine. I was not the first one to get this 'shock'.  Tom Woods  urlLink  in a news group writes  ...   "I'm not totally up on the fine distinctions of the terminology, but it is my understanding that a "cyborg" is a human that has been enhanced by non-organic parts. Metallic skeletons, computer enhanced brains, that sort of thing. So a cyborg would still be subject to the same motives that any human might experience, they would just be able to act upon those motives with greater ability. And therein lies the story...."   The original discussion was started by  urlLink AliasMoze  with the subject "Stephen Hawking protects us from robots". Alias has posted in reponse to  Stephen Hawkings recommendations & views in OBSERVER artcicle  urlLink  Alter our DNA or robots will take over, warns Hawking : Nick Paton Walsh. The Gaurdian also maintain a page on issue related to  urlLink genes ; the devlopment and the ethical issues.  From the same discussion thread I also obtained a link to Wired Article  urlLink Why the future doesn't need us  through the same discussion. The article is written by  urlLink Bill Joy , cofounder and Chief Scientist of Sun Microsystems, was cochair of the presidential commission on the future of IT research, and is coauthor ofThe Java Language Specification.   The Concern :     "Our most powerful 21st-century technologies - robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech - are threatening to make humans an endangered species"   - Bill Joy   Bill in his article quotes  urlLink Ray Kurzweil  author of  urlLink The Spiritual Machines    "If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions, we can't make any conjectures as to the results, because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave. We only point out that the fate of the human race would be at the mercy of the machines."   AND     "Of course, life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or make them "sublimate" their drive for power into some harmless hobby. These engineered human beings may be happy in such a society, but they will most certainly not be free. They will have been reduced to the status of domestic animals"    The original author of these thoughts is Theodore Kaczynski -  urlLink the Unabomber . His bombs killed three people during a 17-year terror campaign and wounded many others. Download his  urlLink manifesto   Bill Joy again quotes  urlLink George Dyson  from  urlLink Darwin Among the Machines ,    "In the game of life and evolution there are three players at the table: human beings, nature, and machines. I am firmly on the side of nature. But nature, I suspect, is on the side of the machines."    There are many such examples, quotes and concerns in the brilliantly written Wired article. Bill Joy has written an excellent piece of work. I now remember that he had also appeared in the documentary on Discovery Channel by which I was shocked. Please have a serious look at the article cos the  urlLink CYBORG IS IN THE MAKING

       Humans vs. Robots vs. Cyborgs vs. Humans    THE PET ROBOT:    The advancements in the field of Robotics and AI are very fast. Honda has trying to develop a robot which can exactly mimic human movements and Sony has already successfully launched artificial electronic pets which can also mimic few emotional states. The technology is advancing very fast, right now the race is to pick up the attributes of the living beings and deliver them with perfection. Most of these attributes are related to the flawless replication of the human movements from the mechanics. But few scientists are trying hard to add the ‘emotional intelligence’ in to these robots by the way of AI (Artificial Intelligence). Right now we have to take care of these robots because they are highly dependant on us for their existence. But in the near future it is very much possible that these robots can surpass the humans in strength and intelligence. The robots right now cost same as a sports car but can become as cheap and as available as a personal computer. They are supposed to help humans in their daily life and enhance the quality of the life; they can be your electronic maid/servant/nurse/friend/escort and so on. But still they will be dependant on you for their maintenance because they would still be ‘somewhat human like robots’.    HUMAN vs. ROBOTS   By 2050 it is guessed that these robots will become more intelligent and tougher than humans. There will be so many robots that they will be able to take their own care, that is they will form an equivalent of a species. A time will come when the usage of these robots can be against the humans in war and politics. Right now all the evil humans are the result of wrong genes and circumstances. But the evil robot could be a result of a ‘program’. Some robots could be programmed as ‘killers’ and some as ‘savers’. The possibility of Humans becoming a ‘sub-species’ and the robots becoming a ‘dominant species’ cannot be denied as we are the successful example of how we are dominating the primates of this planet.    CYBORGS vs. ROBOTS   When the robots will become supreme how are we supposed to conquer them? By becoming half-robot. Half human and half robot termed as ‘Cyborg’. Cyborg will be the choice of the next human race. I have used a wrong word ‘choice’; it would be the only ‘option’. Cyborgs will have the intelligence and flexibility of the human and extra powers & dimensions of a robot. These cyborgs may be fitted with many additional chips which will be ‘senses’ enhancing. That is, these chips ‘inside’ us will provide us the extra powers by increasing the capability of seeing, hearing, feeling, communicating, and so on. Chances are that in the near future you wouldn’t chat with your buddy you would simply broadcast your thoughts. The humans will become the sub-sub-species and will hold no dominance and value on this planet. The robots and the cyborgs would rule the world. The issue would be between the cyborgs and the robots, they would be the main species on the earth, the fight would be between them and humans would be counted as minority community and almost like slaves. The cyborgs and the robots would be so advanced that we the humans would be treated as ‘chimps’. Yes chimps, may be the next generation humans = chimps would be visited by the children of cyborgs & robots in the Zoos on weekends. Robots and cyborgs may complement each other or they would also fight for the dominance. It’s very hard to say right now, but it is a surety that humans won’t have nay part to play in that; humans would have already played their ‘wrongful’ part in the past of tomorrow i.e. today.    CYBORGS vs. HUMANS   Since the major war would be between cyborgs and robots, humans as mentioned above would be reduced to chimps. When the cyborgs that would be half human, would start considering them special they will find that humans are ‘nothing’. Robots and cyborgs would have so much ‘extra’ that they would feel exactly the same as we feel about the chimps. But since these robots and cyborgs are related to humans and would be the advanced versions of humans, they are very much likely to pick the quality of the humans i.e. violence. The beauty of the disaster would be that this violence and all the negative qualities would be ‘programmable’ and with ‘perfection’.    THE DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE   Now you must be really wondering how am I able to know about our ‘future’. I don’t know a shit. Few days back when I was lazily channel surfing; I came across this documentary on Discover Channel. The words sub species and humans becoming chimps are not mine. They have come out of some real great scientists and intellectuals. One mister Warwick who is I guess and if I could remember properly is one of the few examples of  urlLink living cyborg  and one of the first humans to get a chip planted in his body. In his interview he had used the word ‘chimps’ which would be the future name for humans in the future. This left me shocked, if I have to survive respectfully in the future, I have only one option; to upgrade myself and become a cyborg; otherwise I am a god damn chimp. The advance science of today is still discovering new things about humans, the most hidden part being the human mind and the human behavior. But we would jump fast and skip the process of becoming better humans and jump to become cyborgs. Cyborgs & Robots with human-like mental capabilities (AI) would carry the ‘negative’ of humans magnified, glorified, horrific and with superfast perfections. Today we are making a huge fuss over the recent, but can you imagine a future with MWPS = Million Wars Per Second or Million WMDs Per Second and imagine this; Mb/MB won't be Mega bits/Bytes, MB would be  MEGA BUSH . Now you are serious!     JOIN THE DEBATE   This month I would publish more blogs on the same topic and I’ll continue this discussion “Humans Vs Robots Vs Cyborgs Vs Humans” on my blog  urlLink  SanSpeak.BlogSpot.com . I would discuss how it would exactly matter the human race, what points we are missing in mad race for advancement. I would request everybody of you to mail me your thoughts against or for this advancement in technology on my email id sanspeak@rediffmail.com. Think About It.

       President Kalam on Dhirubhai Ambani  It is very entertaining to hear and political person since he has all the masala like a typical Indian film. But it is very hard to find any intelligence in such speeches. Prime Minister of India, Mr. Vajpai is believed to be great orator, but he according to me doesn’t carry any hope for the youth of India. He chooses his word smartly, disarms his opposition effectively, uses floral language and great Hindi. But his words do not make an honest impression and deliver the intelligence. His words are only good for the political House and don’t carry any hope for the citizens of this nation. On the other hand, the speech made by Indian President Mr. Kalam as Dhirubhai Ambani Memorial Lecture made a great impression on me. For the first time I felt that at least there are some people in this country who are where they deserve to be. Mr. Kalam was very honest with his words and carried excellent and extraordinary simplicity. While delivering the lecture he made references, gave credits, cited real life examples, generated enthusiasm, got his audience motivated and most important of all admitted his mistakes so that young can learn from his experiences. He gave a real example of the launching of satellite for the first time in India, how his decision lead to failure and how Mr. Satish Dhavan took the entire responsibility of the failure in front of everybody and when exactly after one year the project was successfully executed Mr. Satish asked Mr. Kalam to take the successful stand in front of everybody. Mr. Satish is an example of some extraordinary people who take the failure on them and give the credit of the success to everybody. Mr. Kalam even admitted that at the time of his failure one journalist even asked him “Did we invest 20 crores to let it go in Bay of Bengal”. How many leaders can give you examples of their own mistakes in the past? Mr. Kalam took this opportunity to inspire young Indian entrepreneurs to think ‘big’ by quoting late Sri Dhirubhai, “Not aiming high is a crime.”

       Dhirubhai Hirachand Ambani   18-12-1932 – 06-07-2002   Late Sri Dhirubhai Ambani was among the very few people in India who think big. Born in a middle class family, he aimed very high and realized very big dreams with this great vision. It is very hard to find successful examples like Dhirubhai in India; just recently we have started seeing the successful individual achievers and entrepreneurs after the advent of IT in our country. All the successful industrialists today have born with a silver, golden or even platinum spoon and they belong to third or fourth generation in the inheritance chain. But Dhirubhai is the only example who has built everything on his own without any inheritance. He didn’t have any IIT or IIM degree to back him up and for that matter not even a full formal education. He was the man of pure guts and spending vision, he worked with his observation & instincts. After his death now his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani and working hard to take his dream forward and entering into the diverse fields through Reliance Life Science,  urlLink Reliance Infocomm  & Reliance Entertainment to name the few. Reliance Infocomm is one such ‘big dream’ and Reliance dreams to become one of the top 10 telecom companies in the world. Dhirubhai is not just name to be remembered as a great successful example of an Indian industrialist. He is ‘hope’ for all the budding entrepreneurs in this country and example of a person who truly understood the meaning of VISION.

       WMD News Updates  Larry Johnson from  urlLink freelancestar  in his article -  urlLink No WMD? Hold Bush accountable  writes that "Not only did Bush and his gang deceive us all, but he's also apparently using the same strategy to further his agenda in the Middle East, possibly to attack Iran, Syria, Jordan, maybe even Korea." His comments were in response to the letter published by Elaine Kozora, who think what might be the reason still the action on Iraq was justified. I think he has summed up the entire thing in few lines very beautifully, who ever thinks that we all are making fuss over WMD and this anti-war thing is just a cool fashionable thing 'must' read his article because it doesn't use pages to describe the things. Just read the following comments and understand it for yourself:-  If we don't hold this administration accountable right now, then we deserve the scorn of the rest of the world. Not because we have so much, but because we once had a democracy and let it slip away. - Larry Johnson    Thanks Larry, Sorry Mr.Bush    urlLink Search for WMD Finds 'Bomb' on Internet  : The site, which is designed to look like a genuine error message -- replete with "bomb" icon -- is the top result when  urlLink "weapons of mass destruction"  is entered into search engine   Google .

       Greatest Disovery Of the century, still 97 years are left for this century, but I am showing my extra respect for CIA & Pakistan & Bush & Lashkar & Qaeda  CIA NOW  urlLink blows a whistle  that - terrorist group al-Qaeda was working with former scientists of Pakistan's nuclear establishment to produce crude weapons of mass destruction, the CIA has said in a new report. USA recenlty has bombed Iraq on the suspicion of WMD, what they are going to do on the confirmation of WMD only Mr. Funny Bush can tell.On the other hand  urlLink US implicitly backed Lashkar  : Cohen, a lawyer for defendant Randall Todd Royer, told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema that the US government has essentially supported Pakistan and its intelligence agency in its dispute with India over the Kashmir territory, despite an official position of neutrality.Cohen further stated that the Pakistani intelligence agency has supported Lashkar-e-Taiba, and that he will be demanding classified reports from the US government to support his contention.The friendly nation Pakistan and it's over friendly innocent agency  urlLink ISI backing Lashkar for global strikes  : Pakistan has been extending covert support to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to carry out subversive activities globally after Taliban and its militant outfit al-Qaeda fell to the US-led War against Terror, according to a Indian home ministry report. Mr. Bush is no doubt very intelligent person to support Pakistan & reward them with billion dollars ( for wrong reasons) because after the onset of War against Terror by the US-led forces, the ISI and the Pakistani regime made a complete U-turn against Taliban and attempted to create an image that it was against the use of its soil by terrorists and Mr. Bush and supower US completely overlooked & ignored it.The result is that Mr. Musharraf can now proudly says  urlLink Nuclear programme is our strength  and Foreign Minister Khurshid M.

       MUNIR KOTADIA :Microsoft open-source NT: Linux's nemesis?  Munir Kotadia on ZDnet.co.uk  urlLink suggests a very strange solution  - "Microsoft has killed off Windows NT, but it should now release its source code to the open-source community in order to fight off the challenge from Linux " According to him -   " However much the software giant would like us to forget that NT ever existed -- and push everyone into a Windows Server 2003 upgrade -- there are thousands of developers out there who would love to have the opportunity to turn the ageing OS into a masterpiece. So why not let them have a go by releasing NT 4.0's source code into the open-source community? He further adds that "The developer community regularly moans about the inefficiencies of 'Micro$oft bloatware' and Microsoft has no love for the open-source community. But for the first time, Windows -- albeit a very old version -- would receive some constructive feedback as the code is scrutinised by people that have not been assimilated into the Redmond collective."   That's what I call a really sentimental writing, Opensource is great...no doubt, but Bill Gates is not a fool to committ this suicide/harakari. If he does god save his soul. And I know many people are eager to fathom Windows Codes but not for making a contribution towards it. If the same time is 'saved' and 'invested' in opensource software it would be a much greater thing to do. Microsoft is in IT Business and had to deliver things 'at the speed of thought' so had to committ mistakes for competition, monopoly , dominance, time to deliver and etc. But when Opensource has already proved to be a serious tool, why do we need to dig the past for a 'so called great learning experience'.

        Indiacause.com Explains Terrorism  As expected, section of politicians and the Pseudo-Secular media are pointing their fingers at Gujarat as the cause of the Mumbai blasts. This is exactly what they want Indians to believe. This is the typical promotion of Jihadism by the Indian P-Sec community. According them, any terrorist attack on India is of a ‘retaliatory’ nature and hence ‘expected’ or may be ‘rightful’. Thank God, they are not pointing ‘Gujarat’ fingers to 9/11, Bali, UN and many such terrorist attacks, before and after.  In reality, the Pakistan sponsored terrorism has nothing to do with any event in India. The ultimate objective of Pakistan is ‘balkanization’ of India and hence the attacks on India will never cease untill our politicians can show the ‘Iron will’ to wipe out Pakistani terrorism. Pakistan can not continue their terrorism even one day if the international community desires so. For the international community to desire so, India will have to become the economic and the military power with ‘Will’ to destroy the terrorist network, infrastructure and camps across the border and ‘liquidate’ their leaders. And to develop that “will” our P-Sec community and the politicians need to be exposed and thrashed forever.

       Mumbai Bomb Blast : Crocodile Tears  Every death is an opportunity for the politicians to appear in the news channel and do the verbal fart. All the politicians from state level to national level were here, were here for what? Don't they know, that their visit will put extra stress on Police force & extra burden on city which is already depressed. And what do these politicians exactly do over there? nothing...just verbal farting and shitting around (sorry the shit word has more value than their words).   Times Of India : On the front page in the article : Visiting Politicians get the stick :  27 August 2003 TOI recived many letter from the readers and collected comments from various people on the politicians who open their shop at the site of disaster.  Homai Elavia says : "It's bad enough that citizens of Mumbai have to face periodic bomb blasts. What's worse is to listen to 'chota-mota' politicians shooting off their big mouths," on the BJP action(?) of demanding resignation of the ruling government, "if this is all they have to say at this time, shut up." Nawaz Mody, head of the politics department at Mumbai University, blames it on the television age, "Increasingly, politicians views these tragedies as photo-ops and literally jostle to get into the frame. What they don't realize is that the public can see just how shameless they are." While these politicians & VIPs were at the disaster sites and hospital indulging in "crocodile-tears" tourism.......  200 shops in the Mumbadevi area were forced to shut their shop.   The peace of hospital and relief operation were distrubed at JJ and G.T hospital.   At these hospital distraught friends and relatives were kept outside, for the comfort and security of these VIPs in the hospital.   Throughout Mumbai you could see more police on roads for the safety of these VIPs and not Mumbai.

       Why Mumbai Has Become The Target Of Terrorism   B. Raman on Sify writes :  Like New York in the US, Mumbai in India has been a tempting target for jihadi terrorists since 1993. It is the economic and financial capital of India. It is the base of India's off-shore oil industry. It is one city in India, which comes nearest to any Western city in its role as the engine of India's industrialisation and modernisation. It provides a vision of what the rest of India could be in the years to come if the modernisation and globalisation policies of the Government continue to make progress.  urlLink More...

       Mumbai Bomb Blast & Politics  Describing the bomb blasts in Mumbai today as "extremely alarming", the Deputy Prime Minister, L.K. Advani, said that investigations were on to establish who were behind them.  (Dear Sir. now you find it "extremely alarming"... did you earlier think it was a "Die Hard" sequel)  He said the security agencies would know within a short time who was behind the explosions. Mr. Advani, who is scheduled to visit Aurangabad tomorrow, may also visit the blast sites.  (They will be making a great achivement, after the naming ceremony... everything will be accomplished and more blast case will be eagerly awaited)  The Defence Minister, George Fernandes, said he suspected that the blasts were the handiwork of terrorists. "My impression is some terrorist group must have masterminded the blasts," Mr. Fernandes, said in Nagpur, after attending a function at Amravati.  (Oh we thought, some kindergarden kids were playing bomb...bomb)  Dear politicians, keep your mouth shut...let the death not be mocked.

       History of Mathematics in India   In all early civilizations, the first expression of mathematical understanding appears in the form of counting systems. Numbers in very early societies were typically represented by groups of lines, though later different numbers came to be assigned specific numeral names and symbols (as in India) or were designated by alphabetic letters (such as in Rome). Although today, we take our decimal system for granted, not all ancient civilizations based their numbers on a ten-base system. In ancient Babylon, a sexagesimal (base 60) system was in use.   - Read the entire Article :  urlLink Science in India: History of mathematics: Indian Mathematicians and Astronomers,

       NDTV : Amir Khan and Barkha with Indian Soldiers  Amir Khan belongs to one of the rare and extinct categories of 'intelligent' film personalities in India. He once again proved himself to be the action man, by spending 2 weeks with Indian soldiers at the border. Yesterday on NDTV there was a long programme which showed Amir Khan in person chatting with the indian soldiers and having a nice entertaining time with them. The porgrammes was covered by none other than one of the few intelligent faces on the indian television scress - Ms. Barkha Roy, she is also famous for her 'Kargil coverage'.  Amir is rarely seen in the public events and the stage shows, atleast in my knowledge he rarely participates in a commercial stage shows and other functions. By other functions I mean, performing in private parties, marriages and birthday's.   But he was at his best with the Indian Soldiers and gave entertaining replies to the questions asked by soldiers. He danced and sang along with them. Only Amir was not on the stage, there were also some 'star soldiers' performing on the stage and Amir was delighted to be the one of the audience.  The most moving part was when soldiers cried, when they were shown recorded video messages from home asking them "Ghar Kab Aooge?". (When you will come, home).   Message from Indian Soldiers on religion and hindu-muslim unity.  " In army there is only one religion, i.e to serve the nation" - by an indian  soldier"  NDTV, Barkha, Amir... there could have been no other way to celegrate our 56th Independance Day. These unknows soldiers protect our independance, isn't it. Let's say thanks to them.

A dancer, Sweety, is in love with Raghu and a gangster Anna is in love with Sweety. One shining light inspires Raghu to coast through his humdrum existence with a semblance of equanimity - the ideal woman Neeta who unfortunately is not a real person but a character in the long running all time hit soap opera, Dard. Reshma, the actress who plays Neeta, is hardly like the character she portrays. What happens when reality collides with fantasy? A madcap adventure that ends with Raghu finally growing up.""- Synopsis at UpperStall.com   Raghu is played by Vijay Raaz, an always brilliant actor. You must remember this noticable actor from "Monsoon Wedding", he had played the "Shaadi Ka Contractor".   The most innovative thing about this movie is the arrangement of finanance. When Rajat felt short of few lakhs for this movie, he floated email to his friends to become part producers of this movie and yes, he got support and finance through this. Really, anything is possible if you have passion and determination.  I have not seen the movie, but storyline and the people involved are really exiting. Best of luck to these guys who give us the real different movies.

        ExTerminators:The Judgement Day & the GigaDeaths   urlLink Hugo de Garis  is concerned that massively intelligent machines ("artilects") could become infinitely smarter than human beings, leading to warring factions over the question: should humanity risk building artilects? Result: gigadeaths. Read his article  urlLink "Building Gods or Building Our Potential Exterminators?"   With the help of Moore's Law he points that Robot artificial intelligence is evolving a million times faster than human intelligence as the chip technology is advancing and increasing the electronic performance massively. He himself is involved in the development of the artifical brain and believes that soon the artificial brained "artilects" (artificial intellects) would be million times more intelligent than the human beings.   For humans he predicts "gigadeaths", the results of the war between the anti-humans and anti-machine groups. He uses the word 'giga' since we will be much more equipped and capable of mass killing each other.  I am basically anti-machine since I believe there has to be limit and ethics to everything. And believe it or not, even if you are not the fan of Terminator and Matrix and similar sci-fi, the end of humans from the hands of robots and cyborgs is very much near. But, Mr. Hugo raises a very valid, strange and shocking point. In the very modern and futuristic world, cyborgs and robots will be the extension or evolution of human beings. If we stop at just being human, he thinks that it will be more tragical than getting killed by robots.   Extending this debate further...  Can we non artificial and natural, made in flesh human beings take this planet further?.   Can we truly say that we are moving towards the better civilized society and better human civilization.?    Are we safe from each other? Or will we be more safe from robots and cyborgs than humans?.   If we have not made the better society and better utilization of resources, what is the possibility that our future will be safe in hands of we, the humans.?   Will it be not a better option, if we gave this artifical robots to save the nature?   Even if this planet is supposed to meet the same future of destruction, wouldn't it be better if it meet its end through super intelligent robots than super self-destructing humans   Please remember... All our progress is measured in artificial world, naturally speaking we are a failure. The natural evolution of human beings has already stopped.m -  urlLink Santoshkumar

       Experential Marketing   urlLink Dr. Bernd Schmitt  is a professor in  urlLink Columbia Business School  and recently conducted a seminar in India on  urlLink Experential Marketing  and stressed on Customer Experience Management (CEM). He elaborates on providing the wholesome experience to the customer; that can be a end user, or the business partner (B2B) and most importantly it can also be the internal employee. The wholesome experience constitutues the unique scenario in which customer is 'in', the current trends, the needs of the customer, the emotion of the customer, making the product appealing to the customer so that all his senses are involved. The product should be exiting to hear, look, feel, touch & use.

       Mumbai Dying  Mumbai is one of the richest cities in the world and definitely the richest city in India. But nowhere else in the World you can find the costliest piece of land attached with a slum. That's mumbai, very unique and very disturbing.    The Mumbai Experiment:  Take small stones and pebbles, put them in a jar and shake it vigorously. The mumbai is the jar and the stones and people are mumbaikars, brushing each other, struggling and often hitting each other but no one is standing still because one cannot afford to stand still in Mumbai. He will be hit, thrown and replaced.   The Mumbai's Slums:  If you are pro poor and very romantic  & artistic person, you would love to fart about the unity in diversity of Mumbai. But mind you, diversity only looks good when you are observing from a distance and you are definitely not in it. People who are away from it, either disgust it or fantasize human rights and what not?. People who face it are the Middle Class, people who educate themselves, fight hard for jobs, run for home loans for a place which is outside the city just because the land which is available in the city has either been commercialized or slumized. The middle class deserves no free lunch. But these poor people who are land encroachers will get free accomodation under the slum rehabilitation scheme. The fact is very much evident that Indian democrazy never recognizes talent and merit, it only recognizes vote bank.   Post Rehabilitation:  Is rehab a solution? What do these slum dwellers come to Mumbai. Some are genuine and most of are here for wrong reasons; films, crime, prostitution, injustice, etc. Some of their problem can be very much solved at the source of it. But we never try to solve any problems at the source, becuase if the problem is solved at source it is 'eradicated' and prevented to grow. If some problems can be prevented, how politician will fuel their manifestoes and speeches.   After we rehab the slums in concrete strucutures, what are they supposed to do? Do they open a canteen, barber shop, butcher house, shoe polish, laundry, brotherel, garage, pan-bidi shop, etc on the 2nd or 3rd floor of the building provided to them. The slum economy is very hard to understand and very complex, the slum economomy is a road economy, the slums are growing and existing beacause a slum is a market cum resedential complex. If you take the slum out of the market crashes and these slum dwellers will have a more tough life, becase their existance is not based on the survival of the fittest and upon the merit system.      The Solution: Understand & Act:   If you think this is Mumbai's problem, you are wrong and or idiot, stupid or corrupt. This is problem of the nation beacuse every city has a slum.   This problem is linked with education, health-care, infrastructure and employment.   This problem exists because we have not been able to isolate villages and cities, understand their unique requirements and meet the needs for the development.   Development need not be in 'pockets' it must spread everywhere.   The talent and merit system should be applicable everywhere.   The laws is a not a historical text, it is a system, therefore it becomes useless after certain period.    There should be law for marriages & having number of childrens. You must qualify to become a parent. Notice to all NGOs and Human Rights Organization (before they cry & shout). Reproduction cannot be considered as a human right, because here were are not talking about the rights of the parent, we are talking about the rights of the childrens.   Rural India needs focus and development.   Politicians should be accountable on a daily basis in the office and in the house (parliament). There should be a point system to all there activities, the person who gets the set number of points should only be allowed to contest for an election or atleast that should be a crtiteria for evaluating candidates. We must exactly now how many hours a these politcians put in usefull activities.   All the government activities must be transparent. I must know as a citizen what is happening in my state. Not by going to certain government office but through technologies like Internet & networked kiosks.    To sum up the matter, yes, the solution is not simple because the problem is complex. Therefore it does not deserve an instant solution at the destination, it should be treated at the source which is very long and uncomfortable.   OOps! Do you still think it is the problem of Mumbai???

        Cyber coolies ?  In Sunday Times of India you will land up on a debate regarding call centers and cyber coolies, people who have lost their identity, working at odd timings for a firang company and living a shaky life. Some professor from Delhi University points all the black in such lifestyle and critisizes it heavily. What I can understand from all this is that....  (1) We would not care what opportunities we are providing.  (2) But if somebody starts earning from whatever he has from an opportunity offered from outside, he is called a 'slave' a 'cyber coolie'.  (3) Do we know that ? The entire IT revolution is result of the 'Brain Drain' & excellent performance of 'code coolism' during Y2K slavery period.   (4) Mind you nobody in this world cares about India as a nation (not even the indians who show that 'they care'), the entire progress and revolution is happening due to 'few indians' who give positive image of India to rest of the India and the world.  (5) You cannot just become IT super power without stepping on the first step, that you call 'coolism'. Once we become fully qualified coolies then only we can move up the value chain to become lords of the IT ring.  (6) Can you all critics shut your mouth and give some positivity and energy to the Indian youth. Even porn stars from foreign land provide more energy and motivation than Indian politicians, so called gurus, intellectuals and popular faces.  READ THIS....   Aren't Indians mostly involved in code writing and are often referred to as 'cyber-coolies'?   I object to the word cyber-coolie. While it may describe the job, the word coolie has a negative connotation. I want to remind you that for 50 years since the independence, our politicians, intellectuals and scientists did not get us the kind of "respect" in the world what these "cyber-coolies" have got us in a few years time. We need to acknowledge them and their work for making us feel proud to be an Indian.   urlLink  Arjun Mehrotra chairman of Techspan in India Today

       Call Centers: Outsourcing to India Saves Financial Services Companies $25 Million  DURHAM, N.C., Sept. 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Financial service corporations that outsource 1,000 jobs overseas can expect upwards of $25 million in savings, according to business intelligence firm Cutting Edge Information.      India, where the cost of labor is about an eighth of U.S. costs, has become a valuable solution to high turnover and workforce apathy in American call centers.  When outsourcing overseas, many financial services companies consider India first.  Primarily, Indian call center employees tend to be more enthusiastic and turnover averages only 5%.  "Managing Financial Services Call Centers," available at http://www.cuttingedgeinfo.com/FS80_Call_Centers/ contains more than 200 metrics and features practices from top financial services companies, such as Merrill Lynch, Fidelity Investments, Citigroup, Capital One, Allstate, Wachovia and MetLife.  The report highlights budget and staffing metrics, as well as strategies and tactics to enhance overall call center efficiency and boost customer satisfaction.      "Customer service has improved drastically when call centers relocate toforeign countries," says Cutting Edge Information senior analyst Elio Evangelista.  "India is an excellent place to outsource because they hold customer service jobs in high esteem and workers tend to care much more about their jobs."  For example, one financial services company relocated its call center operations overseas, allowing them to cut labor costs by 50%.  The company also discovered that the foreign workforce was more skilled than local one had been.      "Managing Financial Services Call Centers" showcases quantitative metrics and qualitative practices in the following areas:      * Call center agents' incentive and compensation packages     * Turnover, blocked calls, cost per rep and many other key performance       measurements     * Inbound and outbound call metrics for the financial services industry     * Up-selling and cross-selling strategies     * Offshore outsourcing     * Process efficiency and call center technology      To view the online summary of this 114-page report, visit  urlLink http://www.cuttingedgeinfo.com/FS80_Call_Centers/  .

       BPO Definitions  Business Process Outsourcing is defined as :   "Delegation of one or more IT-intensive business processes to an external provider that, in turn, owns, administrates and manages the selected process(es) based on defined and measurable performance metrics."            -  urlLink Gartner, BPO is Asia Pacific (PDF)    "Business process outsourcing (BPO) is the act of giving a third-party the responsibility of running what would otherwise be an internal system or service. For instance, an insurance company might outsource their claims processing program or a bank might outsource their loan processing system.   Typically, companies that are looking at business process outsourcing are hoping to achieve cost savings by handing the work to a third-party that can take advantage of economies of scale by doing the same work for many companies. Or perhaps the cost savings can be achieved because labor costs are lower due to different costs of living in different countries."           -  urlLink Mariosalexandrou    "Business process outsourcing (BPO) is the contracting of a specific business task, such as payroll, to a third-party service provider. Usually, BPO is implemented as a cost-saving measure for tasks that a company requires but does not depend upon to maintain their position in the marketplace. BPO is often divided into two categories: back office outsourcing which includes internal business functions such as billing or purchasing, and front office outsourcing which includes customer-related services such as marketing or tech support.   BPO that is contracted outside a company's own country is sometimes called offshore outsourcing. BPO that is contracted to a company's neighboring country is sometimes called nearshore outsourcing, and BPO that is contracted with the company's own county is sometimes called onshore outsourcing."           -  urlLink Search CIO @ techtarget   Visit on these above mentioned links to find more about BPO & Outsourcing....

       The Definition of Outsourcing   Outsourcing has been defined as:   "A contractual relationship where an external organisation takes responsibility for performing all or part of an agency's Information Technology functions. This can involve a partial or complete transfer of staff and/or resources."    & also as   "An arrangement whereby a third party provider assumes responsibility for performing information systems functions at a pre-determined price and according to predetermined performance criteria."    -  urlLink Australian Computer Society paper on outsourcing    "Work done for a company by people other than the company's full-time employees".  -  urlLink InvestorWords    "Outsourcing is when a company purchases a product or process from an outside supplier rather than producing in house. This is different from subcontracting because the customer does not own the raw material or manufacturing process but buys the product based on the specifications offered by the supplier. The customer trains and develops the supplier to form a supply chain partnership."  -  urlLink Outsource Solutions, LLC    "Outsourcing is an arrangement in which one company provides services for another company that could also be or usually have been provided in-house. Outsourcing is a trend that is becoming more common in information technology and other industries for services that have usually been regarded as intrinsic to managing a business. In some cases, the entire information management of a company is outsourced, including planning and business analysis as well as the installation, management, and servicing of the network and workstations. Outsourcing can range from the large contract in which a company like IBM manages IT services for a company like Xerox to the practice of hiring contractors and temporary office workers on an individual basis."  -  urlLink SearchSAP @ SearchTechTarget.com

       Gururaj on Indian BPO   urlLink New US Rules On BPO Are No Cause Of Worry: Deshpande | Finacial Express   The new US rules and guidelines on BPO cannot hamper Indian prospects as economics will ensure that the cheapest mode will survive and with India’s advances in the sector, there was always hope for the country, according to  urlLink Gururaj Desh Deshpande  of  urlLink Sycamore Networks . Mr Deshpande, who along with a few entrepreneurs from the Silicon Valley are here in connection with the CEO summit as part of the ‘ urlLink Amritavarsham 50 ’, told a group of mediapersons the quality of Indian technology had literally left the US ‘scared’.

        Transforming Mumbai   urlLink Rs 2,000 billion is what Mumbai needs to be a Shanghai | Indian Express   urlLink Bombay First  &  urlLink McKinsey  have submitted a report to Maharashtra government to improve mumbai and roadmap to achieve these goals by 2013...  • Boost economic growth to 8-10 per cent instead of 2.4 presently. That should create half a million new jobs.  • Improve mass and private transport infrastructure through new rail lines, expressways and buses. Eventually, no more than 220 people in a rail coach, compared to the 570 today.  • Reduce the slum population by at least 20 per cent from 60 per cent presently by constructing one million homes.  • Other improvements: reduce air pollution, increase water supply, cut administrative expenses by half, and, the most important, cut red tape.  But I am very sceptical whether these plan or any other plan with similar intentions will ever start. The politics and red tape are the biggest hurdle in its path. The other hurdles are opprotunitic people, pro-poor activists & lazy attitude of all of us. We should realize that problem of our slum city is very serious and must be dealt urgently, otherwise we will have to actually rename mumbai (bombay) to "Slum City". Politcians would first like to see their name to be attached with the projects, so if congress does it, shiva sena will oppose it and vice-a-versa. The biggest looser in this game would be an avergae "mumbaikar", the middle-class person who is always screwed first. The prime and public land in the entire mumbai either belongs to rich or poor(slums) and despite paying tax regularly and living a very hard life the mumbaikar ultimately has '0' options available to him. From the start of the day till night an average mumbaikar is fighting, fighting and fighting. We need somebody like Tamil Nadu CM Chandra Babu Naidu to bring life in this city and to have some hope for the working class and stop giving free lunches to 'rich only' or to 'poor only'.

       FACTS ABOUT INDIA  You may know some of the following facts. These facts were recently published in a German magazine, which deals with WORLD HISTORY FACTS ABOUT INDIA.   India never invaded any country in her last 1000 years of history.    India invented the Number system.  urlLink Aryabhatta  invented 'zero.'    The world's first University was established in  urlLink Takshila  in 700BC. More than 10,500 students from all over the world studied more than 60 subjects. The University of  urlLink Nalanda  built in the 4th century BC was one of the greatest achievements of ancient India in the field of  urlLink education .    According to the Forbes magazine,  urlLink Sanskrit  is the most suitable language for  urlLink computer software .     urlLink Ayurveda  is the earliest school of medicine known to humans.     Although western media portray modern images of India as poverty striken and underdeveloped through political corruption,  urlLink India  was once the richest empire on earth.     The art of navigation was born in the river Sindh 5000 years ago. The very word "Navigation" is derived from the Sanskrit word NAVGATIH.    The value of pi was first calculated by Budhayana, and he explained the concept of what is now known as the Pythagorean Theorem. British scholars have last year (1999) officially published that Budhayan's works dates to the 6th Century, which is long before the European mathematicians.     urlLink Algebra, trigonometry and calculus  came from India. Quadratic equations were by Sridharacharya in the 11th Century; the largest numbers the Greeks and the Romans used were 106 whereas Indians used numbers as big as 1053.     According to the Gemmological Institute of America, up until 1896, India was the only source of diamonds to the world.     USA based  urlLink IEEE  has proved what has been a century-old suspicion amongst academics that the pioneer of wireless communication was Professor Jagdeesh Bose and not Marconi.     The earliest reservoir and dam for irrigation was built in Saurashtra.     Chess was  urlLink invented  in India.     urlLink Sushruta  is the father of surgery. 2600 years ago he and health scientists of his time conducted surgeries like cesareans, cataract, fractures and urinary stones. Usage of anaesthesia was well known in ancient India.    When many cultures in the world were only nomadic forest dwellers over 5000 years ago, Indians established  urlLink Harappan culture  in  urlLink Sindhu Valley (Indus Valley Civilisation) .     The place value system, the  urlLink decimal system  was developed in India in 100 BC.   Recived via email, these facts are widely available on the net but to add my contribution I have remixed it with html links. If you know the original author and please provide the links where I have missed it or if you have some more links to share related to above facts. Thanks in Advance.

When Wally asks him, "Are you tired?", he replies: "I am trained to only sleep during National Holidays".......

People who have longstanding weblogs who want to keep their following will find that they have to behave like portals.  That is, they will have to become very rich in links, and reduce their self-expression (or express themselves by the way in which they select links).  If you want to express yourself heavily (as I do), and you want a large following, then I think you will have to progressively narrow your scope.   People will come to you for your area of expertise, not for stuff that they can find just as easily elsewhere.   [ Learnt Via :  urlLink Emergic.org - Blog As Portals?  ]

       Inspiring Images of India  Have you ever noticed that most of the inspiring images of India come from the VIDESHI (foreign) channels. What you can see on India channel is a mental rape of sense and sensibilities, sas-bahu, political pimps and farting intellectuals. Just few days back on some news channel I heard Laloo saying "this is good that Ganga Mayya has come to us", this was his comments on recent flood in Patna, Bihar.  urlLink Naseeruddin Shah  has once said in his television interview that " after 20 years if your child asks you to show how India was now, you won't have any single movie to show it to him because none of the movie depicts India". But fortunately channels like  urlLink Discovery India  and  urlLink National Geographic  show the real India, be it rural india or urban india, be it culture or science. Similarly the news of  urlLink CNBC India  is more inspiring that Aaj Tak which is more about, how politicians are ruining our country and how we are blindly enjoying it. Relax it's democrazy....

       Paid Prescriptions  SHABNAM MINWALLA  urlLink reports  in Times of India...  How does a doctor decide which drugs to prescribe to his patients? If an ongoing study is any indication, the capsules and creams may be chosen less for their curative powers than their lucrative side-effects.  For, in the profit-oriented world of pharmaceuticals, doctors are routinely wooed with gifts ranging from mobile phones to sponsored weddings. These details emerged from a study on the ‘Promotional Practices of Pharmaceutical Firms in India’, conducted by the Forum for Medical Ethics in collaboration with the Drug Controller General of India and the World Health Organisation (WHO).   We are not shocked, are we ? It is wide open fact that even the small time doctors are wooed by pharmaceutical companies by gifts like pens, watches, diaries and other stuffs depending upon numbe of patients (customers). Another fact also known is that Doctors prescriber unnecessary tests to get the cuts from the labs. Moreover, the new hike in fees for medical colleges ensures that meritious medical aspirant is stopped and itches a smooth path for undeserving rich candidates who will join these medical markets.

He has worked with a number of prominent companies in the UK including Time Out, and developed innovative message-boards for the BBC and EMAP. He recently launched "Conversations" - a new form of geocoded message-board for the UK-based local information publisher UpMyStreet, where he works as Creative Producer.

But maybe we did... There's not a lot of difference between weblogs and homepages in some respects. Both are spaces to put written content online, for one. But the fact that homepages had no sense of standard structure, required manual updating, were unbound from time and were resolutely non-discursive meant that they were static, lumpen. At their best they became monolithic tomes - bunkers for content, guides updated haphazardly that infinitesimally accrete "content". In terms of the distribution of the word, the homepage was like a "Time Out Guide to {your name here}". The simple addition of structure and mechanisms for ease of publishing have made the comparable form of expression on weblogs so fluid and quick that it borders on speech. In terms of self-representation, the homepage is like a statue carved out of marble labelled carefully at the bottom where the weblog is like an avatar in cyberspace that we wear like a skin. It moves with us - through it we articulate ourselves. The weblog is the homepage that we wear.  And this is the big leap forward - this is where the value of weblogs lies in the newly amateurised world. This flexibility of publishing creates a fluid and living form of self-representation, the 'homepage (as a place)' has become the 'weblog (as a person)' that can articulate a voice. And when there are a multiplicity of voices in space, then the possibility arises of conversations. And where there is conversation there is the sharing of information. And conversation about what? Well everything from music and movies and animation and medical information. Weblogs are becoming the bridge between the individual and the community in cyberspace - a place where one can self-publicise and self-describe but also learn, debate and engage in community. In other words, weblogs are not only a representative sample of mass amateurisation, they're becoming enmeshed in the very structures of information-retrival, community interaction and media distibution themselves. Weblogs are now facilitators of mass amateurisation. They're almost becoming one of its architectures... [ Through :  urlLink Emergic.org ]

       No Ghost, Just Low Frequencies   urlLink Soundless Music Shown to Produce Weird Sensations | Reuters | Patricia Reaney   If next time you are feeling a wierd sensation or shivers down your spine, don't think that your house is haunted, it must be very low frequency sounds.   British scientists have shown in a controlled experiment that the extreme bass sound known as infrasound produces a range of bizarre effects in people including anxiety, extreme sorrow and chills -- supporting popular suggestions of a link between infrasound and strange sensations.  For a DIY at home just sit in front of a large woofer at your home and play some deep bass sounds, you will feel some sensation in your heart, just like when you are suddenly shocked by the noise of a falling object.

       Musical Indian Advertising  Latest trend in the Indian broadcast advertising is creating short musical ads. There is no product blah blah, no seducing schemes, just soulful music and happy customers. The music is cool Indian soft music with feel in it. This type of advertising is very impressive in case of brands which are already known and have loyal customer. These ads essentially express the happiness the cutomers have while enjoying that brand.

       MUMBAI 25/8   urlLink Blasts: Accused blames Gujarat riots - Sify.com  Can anybody have a valid reason to kill somebody? Atleast these bastards have. Terrorism in India is to kill to easy targets. Maximum victims of any terrorist acts are unarmed children and women. If I cannot kill you I will kill "anybody" whom I can kill, that's the simple rule. Our government and we have given the social acceptance to terrorism. The words like ISI, Jehad, Lashkar, etc.. are spoken as if they are from nursery rhymes. Whenever any incidents happen the government just waits .. who is coming up to take the responsibility and by default attach ISI with it. This is the fact, but it cannot be a full stop. There cannot be dialogue with any terrorist be it a individual, organization or country like Pakistan. Few politician marched with black bands on their mouth as a silent protest in mumbai, how could they? the city was ashamed seeing their shameless endeavours and mumbai itself was on protest although it didn't have any black bands. Mumbaikar / Indians themselves are not caring... as far as somebody from own family is not killed it's hardly a matter. When some one very own is killed then we will cry and howl and beat our chest ... we have to realize ... kashmir & mumbai are both in India and India is the target.. if any other indian is killed I can also be killed. But who cares - Vajpayee is busy slow motion speeches, Advani in ayodhya issue, Mayawati in Taj, Shinde in excuses, Balashaheb in finger pointing, Laloo in Gangajaal, .... Relax you are living in India.... Nobody care's ... Isn't it?... well...DO YOU ?  Enjoy  urlLink 25/8, Mumbai: The Jihadi Iceberg   India is proud to have 25/8 . It bigger than 9/11 numerically.

        Join the IIT Debate   urlLink Do we need more IITs?  The Indian government has decided to  urlLink increase the numbers of IITs  and Rediff is hosting this debate DO WE NEED MOERE IITs.? Well yes and no? Yes for - such a wonderful brand called IIT has to grow atleast one per each state. No for - What happens to REC, they are running on their own - some are having good education and indstury interface and most of others are nothing but a big godown like buldings with lots of corruption and no education. It will be a narrow minded thinking to concentrate just on IIT because there are millions of eligeable and talented student outside IITs also. What kind of quality and assurance do the REC student get, are they IInd class student citizens of this world. When they shell out a heavy fees for their education why can't they get a comparable if not equal standards. There is a wide level of difference between the standards of REC & IITs, we need plan for both and not just IIT. And why just REC also?. What about primary and secondary education. This is because our government doesn't have an wholesome thinking, they just want to convey news and not the right messages. As Mr. Nehru had once said there is Unity in Diversity of India, I think it must be a typo or his ignorance over the matter. There is always Diversity in Unity of India and our politicians and goverment knows how to maintain it, remember they have inherited this from Divide and Rule government.

      There are many companies / brands / products whose names were derived from strange circumstances.  *Mercedes This was actually the financier's daughter's name.  *Adobe This came from name of the river Adobe Creek that ran behind the house of founder John Warnock.  *Apple Computers It was the favorite fruit of founder Steve Jobs. He  was three months late in filing a name for the business, and he threatened to call his company Apple Computers if the other colleagues didn't suggest a better name by 5 O'clock.  *CISCO It is not an acronym as popularly believed. It is short for San Francisco.   *Compaq This name was formed by using COMp, for computer, and PAQ to denote a small integral object.  *Corel The name was derived from the founder's name Dr. Michael Cowpland. It stands for COwpland REsearch Laboratory.  *Google The name started as a joke boasting about the amount of information the search-engine would be able to search. It was originally named 'Googol', a word for the number represented by 1 followed by 100 zeros. After founders - Stanford graduate students Sergey Brin and Larry Page presented their project to an angel investor,they received a cheque made out to 'Google'  *Hotmail Founder Jack Smith got the idea of accessing e-mail via the web from a computer anywhere in the world. When Sabeer Bhatia came up with the business plan for the mail service,he tried all kinds of names ending in 'mail' and finally settled for hotmail as it included the letters "html" - the programming language used to write web pages. It wasinitially referred to as HoTMaiL with selective uppercasing.  *Hewlett Packard Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard or Packard-Hewlett.  *Intel Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore wanted to name their new company 'Moore Noyce' but that was already trademarked by a hotel chain so they had to settle for an acronym of INTegrated ELectronics.  *Lotus (Notes) Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from 'The Lotus Position' or 'Padmasana'. Kapor used to be a teacher of Transcendental Meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.  *Microsoft Coined by Bill Gates to represent the company that was devoted to MICROcomputer SOFTware. Originally christened Micro-Soft, the '-' was removed later on.  *Motorola Founder Paul Galvin came up with this name when his company started manufacturing radios for cars. The popular radio company at the time was called Victrola.  *ORACLE Larry Ellison and Bob Oats were working on a consulting project for the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). The code name for the project was called Oracle (the CIA saw this as the system to give answers to all questions or something such). The project was designed to help use the newly written SQL code by IBM. The project eventually was terminated but Larry and Bob decided to finish what they started and bring it to the world. They kept the name Oracle and created the RDBMS engine. Later they kept the same name for the company.  *Sony It originated from the Latin word 'sonus' meaning sound, and 'sonny' a slang used by Americans to refer to a bright youngster.  *SUN Founded by 4 Stanford University buddies, SUN is the acronym for Stanford University Network. Andreas Bechtolsheim built a microcomputer; Vinod Khosla recruited him and Scott McNealy to manufacture computers based on it, and Bill Joy to develop a UNIX-based OS for the computer.  *Yahoo! The word was invented by Jonathan Swift and used in his book 'Gulliver's Travels'. It represents a person who is repulsive in appearance and action and is barely human. Yahoo! Founders Jerry Yang and David Filo selected the name because they considered themselves yahoos.

       Winners Never Quit  Through Email A winner is NOT one who NEVER FAILS, but one who NEVER QUITS! . read on..  A candidate for a news broadcasters post was rejected by officials since his voice was not fit for a news broadcaster.He was also told that with his obnoxiously long name, he would never be famous. *He is Amitabh Bacchan.  A small boy - the fifth amongst seven siblings of a poor father, was selling newspapers in a small village to earn his living.He was not exceptionally smart at school but was fascinated by religion and rockets.The first rocket he built crashed. A missile that he built crashed multiple times and he was made a butt of ridicule. He is the person to have scripted the Space Odyssey of India single-handedly -  *Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.   In 1962, four nervous young musicians played their first record audition for the executives of the Decca recording Company.The executives were not impressed. While turning down this group of musicians, one executive said, "We don't like their sound. Groups of guitars are on the way out." * The group was called The Beatles.     In 1944, Emmeline Snively, director of the Blue Book Modelling Agency told modelling hopeful Norma Jean Baker, "You'd better learn secretarial work or else get married." *She went on and became Marilyn Monroe.   In 1954, Jimmy Denny, manager of the Grand Ole Opry, Fired a singer after one performance. He told him, "You ain't goin' nowhere....son. You ought to go back to  drivin' a truck." * He went on to become Elvis Presley.  * When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, it did not ring off the hook with calls from potential backers.  After making a demonstration call,President Rutherford Hayes said, "That's an amazing invention, but who would ever want to see one of them?"   * When Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, he tried over 2000 experiments before he got it to work. A young reporter asked him how it felt to fail so many times. He said, "I never failed once. I invented the light bulb. It just happened to be a 2000-step process."  * In the 1940s, another young inventor named Chester Carlson took his idea to 20 corporations, including some of the biggest in the country.They all turned him down. In 1947, after 7 long years of rejections, he finally got a tiny company in Rochester, NY, the Haloid company, to purchase the rights to his invention -- an electrostatic paper-copying process.Haloid became Xerox Corporation.   *A little girl - the 20th of 22 children, was born prematurely and her survival was doubtful. When she was 4 years old, she contracted double pneumonia and scarlet  fever, which left her with a paralysed left leg. At age 9, she removed the metal leg brace she had been dependent on and began to walk without it. By 13 she had developed a rhythmic walk, which doctors said was a miracle. That same year she decided to become a runner. She entered a race and came in last. For the next few years every race she entered, she came in last. Everyone told her to quit, but she kept on running. One day she actually won a race. And then another.From then on she won every race she entered.Eventually this little girl - Wilma Rudolph, went on to win three Olympic gold medals.  A school teacher scolded a boy for not paying attention to his mathematics and for not being able to solve simple problems.  She told him that you would not become anybody in life.  * The boy was Albert Einstein.  The Moral of the above Stories:   * Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet  Only through experiences of trial and suffering can the soul be  strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired and success achieved. * You gain strength, experience and confidence by every experience where  you really stop to look fear in the face. * You must do the thing you cannot do. And remember, the finest steel gets  sent through the hottest furnace. *In LIFE, remember that you pass this way only once! let's live life to  the fullest and give it our extreme best. * "Failure is the pillar of success!"  * "Pick battles big enough to matter, small enough to win."

       Win-Win Outsourcing  Ronen Sen, Indian high commissioner to Britain writes in Hindustan Times and its a very simple thing to follow for the anti-india anti-outsourcing crowd of the developed nations. A must read...  This is what developed nations get...  According to conservative estimates, US companies saved $16 billion and British firms saved around £1 billion through outsourcing to India last year  Not just costs, but quality  It is not just lower labour costs that are making India an increasingly attractive global location for outsourcing. It has been the experience of virtually every British, or foreign, company that savings in labour costs in India become secondary to the marked improvement in quality and consumer satisfaction.  This applies not just to relatively low skill operations like call centres, but higher value added services involving financial management, sophisticated software development, realignment and optimisation of total business operations and so on.   This is what I also say...  In a globalised economy, one cannot reasonably expect unhindered movement of capital and free trade only in selected goods and services, and impose barriers in other areas that do not suit the short-term interests of some nations.  Countries like India do not need aid or handouts but greater market access in goods and services, not on concessional, but on an equitable and mutually advantageous basis.

       Big BPOs Big Jobs  Dollar economics, availibility of english speaking masses, hi-tech talent and loads of industry enthusiasm and proven results encourages multinationals to set up shops in India. Even with a lavish infrastructure & salaries they are bound to invest/spend less compared to US or any other developed nation. Many patriotic drives and local concerns are raising their voice agains this phenomenon, but always get to see counter reports on the merits and demerits of outsourcing. If US would try to save the local jobs, that will mean more expensenses and hence hard survival of these corporations and utltimately it would affect their economy only. This hatred is creating anti-india sentiments and taking a political shape. Ofcourse local interests are important, but these issues are raised by developing nations from a long time. Why there is hue and cry when you are beaten in your own game?. When developing nations raise their concerns they are told about 'global market', 'free-trade', 'fair-trade' and blah-blah, but when it comes to them 'global turns to local'.   V.k.raghunathan  reports in The Straits Times  urlLink Business outsourcing brings top jobs to India  :: Centres serving multinationals earn $4b and employ 170,000 Indians - this will increaseto $31b and nearly one million jobs by 2008 Professionals looking for high-paying jobs do not need to go abroad - more and more multinationals are moving their operations to India.According to The New York Times, US companies are expected to farm out jobs worth US$136 billion by 2015.

       High Tech and Middle Class Growth  Middle class is seeing change in the way they live, opportunities in the job markets are rising and people are now little more hopeful compared to recent bad times we have seen. The graduates atleast now can get a job on the basis of their language skills alone in a call center. And as I have said in my recent post that , the small towns are also seeing the growth and opportunities. Where the middle class lack is , the entreprenurship. But since we going through a change, we will surely catch up sometime on entrepreneurship also.    urlLink High tech fuels India's growth : "Although economists agree that India's middle class is growing rapidly, estimating its size is difficult because there is no consensus on its definition. By American standards, the lifestyle enjoyed by Chakrabarty would hardly be considered lavish. But according to a ranking system devised by the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi, which recently completed a survey of Indian consumption patterns based on interviews with 300,000 households, Chakrabarty and his family belong to the category of 'very rich,' one of whose attributes is car ownership.  Based on those definitions, Executive Director Suman Bery said, about 550 million of India's 1.04 billion people could have been considered middle class in 2000, the latest year for which survey data are available. That's a big jump from 1990, when the number of middle-class Indians, both climbers and consumers, was estimated at 310 million."....

Businesses are now looking forwards towards the Rural Marketing and understanding the minds of Rural Indian Consumer.

        BPO moving up the value chain  BPO companies are trying hard to move up the  urlLink value chain .Evalueserve is one of them and it is doing this by providing value added services like patent writing, market research and multilingual services. The kind of possibilities they are handling are :- * Evaluating the commercial prospects of inventions in Russia and China. Evalueserve’s client, which specialises in extraction of intellectual property from Russia and China, was hired by the U.S. Commerce Department to analyse such inventions with the objective of keeping such technology out of the “wrong” hands.  * Research for a hedge fund’s database, tracking financial statements of 2,300 companies. This is soon expected to grow to 6,000 companies.  * Research and analysis of value-chain segments and industry developments for a market research firm specialising in information technology and telecommunications.  * Market forecast studies for an OTC drug worldwide for a research firm.

       The rise of outsourcing   urlLink Outsourcing  and  urlLink selective outsourcing  is on rise. But now we should also start focussing on the Product Development . It's very hard to digest that firms like WIPRO and INFOSYS are just large manpower and service providers, but when it come to products they don't have anything substantial to offer,atleast to my knowledge. Wipro seems to be trying its hand in health care and other sectors but still it has not carved it's name. There are very few examples like i-flex. We need to understand that tomorrow may not provide us with waves like y2k, euro conversion, dot com, outsourcing, call centres and bpo. We need to create the wave instead of just riding on the wave.

       Blame it on Gandhi  Yesterday on 2nd October India celebrated Gandhi Jayanti. Earlier when I was in school it used to be the time too see movie "Gandhi" on television. I think this movie is the only movie where India is shown so strong. Gandhi ji is just a brand name today, congress has ruled this country more than 40 years by cashing on names like him and Nehru, then Indira and then Rajiv. Now their image is no more than anti-BJP and BJP, even though has a image of  Hinduism and some say fundamentalism, according to me it has no image whatsover. It has the only image of a 'struggler', it is just struggling to be in power in the name of anything. They are so busy in holding their seats that any ideology cannnot stay with them. They are trying to please to many lords.   Speaking of brand name Gandhi, there are two people in india who according to their holistic knowledge either love gandhi or hate gandhi. I am one of the rare categories, who is complete neutral. I like people and I respect them but I treat nobody like god and never hate anybody like devil. Today it has become very fashionable to blame gandhiji for each and everything in India to relationship with Pakistan. Whatever may be the actual thing, I am having no knowledge of history but I know that there were few leaders in this country who didn't construct or hold any thing for themselves and among those one was Gandhi ji. But may be his ideologies might have not been applicable everywhere but we cannot blame him for that. That time was different, that battle ground was different and it's very easy to pass comments in the comfort of our democracy where nobody cares.  I praise gandhi ji for....  *Showing the path of Satyagraha *Preaching Non-Violence *Quit India Movement *Boycott of foreign goods at those times *Preaching Truth  Instead of blaming and digging the past if we would have concentrated on rural development which was hihgly stressed upon by gandhiji, half of India's problem would have been solved by now. So my request to everybody is that however fashionable you may find critisizing and blaming gandhiji, yeh public hai .. yeh sab janti hai.   I only blame gandhi ji for one thing "KHADI", the ultimate formal wear of political devils.

       The outsourcing of America’s jobs  The article discusses the effects of outsourcing on the American Middle Class. Many people in USA are now becoming 'India-aware' but are they not aware how developed nations and their coporations have been exploiting developing nations from years. But again we cannot blame them, cause almost all developing nations are headed by fully corrupt politicians.   urlLink The outsourcing of America’s jobs     Today, consistent with economic globalization policies, corporate America is either importing less-costly immigrant labor or shipping jobs out of America and into underdeveloped countries, where profits can be maximized. Jobs are being taken out of the U.S., while President Bush is busy telling Americans that they will see more jobs.   At the same time, he is pushing to reduce regulations on industry to increase overseas trade. And who do you really think is going to reap the benefits of any proposed tax relief? Government is coerced into fostering legislation that allows corporations to carry out their plans (i.e. The North America Trade Agreement, etc.). Hence, major corporations are downsizing their American workforce and at the same time exporting jobs into Mexico, Latin America, Taiwan, China, India, Russia and other parts of the world.

       Controversial Outsourcing  Subir Roy of Business Standards interviews of  Harris N Miller who  is president of the  urlLink Information Technology Association of America   (ITAA), which represents over 500 leading IT-related companies in the US.    "What is your role in the US? Ans. The role of IT in the US is to stop bad things from happening. We want to stop governments from imposing restrictions on work going offshore, stop there being additional restrictions on immigration. If the opponents define the debate as a win-lose situation, that if the Indian industry grows, the US industry falls, then we, the US and the Indian industry, are all in trouble. If we define the debate in the US and in India as a win-win and be mutually together then the opponents are going to fall by the wayside.    It has been said that it is necessary to seek a far higher level of political support on the issue in the US than available so far.   Ans. Even the strongest supporter of globalisation in the US Congress is not a strong supporter when unemployment is 7 or 8 per cent in his Congressional district. The ITAA and its member companies who support globalisation don’t support offshoring. We don’t support losing jobs to India. My membership [of ITAA] is US-based.  We support fair global competition, we oppose restrictions on it and we have to convince our elected officials day in and day out. My lobbying message is: that’s a better model than the restrictionist and protectionist one. And we can give them things to do, like promoting education and training in the US. We’ve been falling behind in the US on this. "   -  urlLink Business Standard .. ‘Outsourcing to India is a controversial issue’ :

His sites the example of Intellectual Property Rights and Patentism.  "   The rich world has used its bargaining position to demand extraordinary concessions for its corporations. The classic example is the agreement on trade-related Intellectual Porperty Rights. 97% of patents are owned by coporations in the rich world, and it will cost poor nations $40 billion a year in licence fees, half of which will be payable to companies based in US. In return, it is very hard to see what the poorer nations have gained.  "

       Outlanding Outsourcing    urlLink Scorp  writes  urlLink Outlandish outsourcing: What are its long-term effects? | TechRepublic . A wonderful article on protectionism, outsourcing and free market. The ultimate question raised by author is what would happen if US Govt or any govt for that matter would try to fix it. A must read   And they call this "protectionism"…why??  It doesn't protect the rights of the workers if the company is forced to lay off employees, or, worst case, to close its doors. Yet there are plenty of people who would call that company "unpatriotic" (or worse—if in fact there IS a worse insult, these days!) for contracting out the job to a foreign-based concern. The point is, though, that the Law of Supply and Demand, with its inexorable corollaries of Price and Cost, is not mocked lightly nor for long. It's also an historical fact that legislating "protective" trade laws never really works on a long-term basis. It also quickly creates an underground market for smuggled goods. In the case of application code, that smuggling may be done rather undetectably—a few .zip files e-mailed nonchalantly over the wire, and delivery is a fact.

The trend has recently caught the attention of the worldwide community and become the latest buzzword doing the rounds of US media, industry and political circles due to the depressed economies world over. Recent studies on the benefits of IT outsourcing by business intelligence organizations such as McKinsey & Co. and other leading research companies have indicated the following:  The ITES/BPO market is likely to touch US$142 billion in 2009, against the current cost of US$532 billion for these services. The difference of US$ 390 billion represents the net saving the US economy can expect from offshoring  Such savings have a huge economic impact on dollar savings, leading to value creation for shareholders and the common man  US banks, financial services and insurance companies have saved US$6-8 billion in the past four years owing to IT outsourcing to India  Helped by these savings, companies have prevented layoffs and instead added 125,000 more jobs  Offshoring to India has resulted in quality and productivity gains of the order of 15-20 percent  US BFSI sector has managed to register customer satisfaction of almost 85% due to Offshoring to India vis-a-vis their European competitors "..............................................

       Forbes Face Of The Year : Kiran Karnik   urlLink  Forbes  recognises India's IT prowess, puts face to it : HindustanTimes.com : "Kiran Karnik, the president of the  urlLink National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) , is  urlLink Forbes’ Face of the Year 2003 . If Nasscom is the self-proclaimed voice of India’s IT industry, Karnik is “the man trying to direct the path of the offshoring tsunami”, says America’s premier business magazine."   In additions :- Forbes puts it: “Despite concerns in the US about unemployment and lost innovation, there is no turning back. The pressure on US companies to cut costs and compete globally is too compelling.”  Forbes acknowledges India’s strong credentials, pointedly referring to its annual crop of 75,000 IT graduates. Little wonder, IT now accounts for 3 per cent of India’s GDP, or $16.5 billion, up from just $1.7 billion nine years ago. And the big driver in all this is exports of software and services to the US.  Forbes says under Karnik Nasscom has been true to its charter of promoting India’s technology strength to the world and fostering a business-friendly environment for companies setting up shop in India. Over the past few years, many crucial white-collar tech jobs such as application development, database design, integration and services have moved to India.

How well connected you find yourself locally other than mails. The Internet is mostly english and the content is more available for the developed nations, for developing nations you really need to drill down the internet because any useful information you find is in tits and bits and that also replicated on 1000s of pages. There has to be abundance of 'local' and 'intelligent' information availability which can 'really serve' the locals. Something like Ryze, which again is english speaking but is targetting the right audience, but what if there is RYZE-like thing for rest of the Indians in their local language. We may say why any villager or non-english-speaking would get 'connected', but why won't he get 'connected' if there is somethting 'in it - for him'. Ofourse the localized net doesn't mean 'content and news and blah blah blah', localization means - the ability of the localite to do something useful with the internet.

       A Personal Guide to Offshoring to India   urlLink Business Wire News Reports .   urlLink Majesco  Software President Writes New Book Outlining Process for Successful Partnering with Indian IT Firms      Outsourcing technology development projects offshore to Indian software firms creates new benefits for American corporations and stimulates the American economy, writes  urlLink Atul Vohra , president of  urlLink Majesco  Software, in a new book, "A Personal Guide to Offshoring to India."   But to leverage the maximum benefits of offshoring to India companies must know and follow proven processes for outsourcing work, Vohra writes in his new book, scheduled for release in December.   "India represents America's next great frontier. Working together, the United States and India will grow exponentially stronger. India's strengths in offshoring match up well with the needs and interests and culture of the most powerful nation on Earth. As China is America's foundry, India is the back office. And India is well positioned to become the back office for America, so that America may deploy her resources most effectively elsewhere," Vohra writes in the book.   In his book, Vohra analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of moving projects offshore and particularly to India. He utilizes extensive research and his own experience as president of the U.S. operations for a global software development company to give a step-by-step plan that takes advantage of the strengths of the Indian IT firms. Vohra cites examples of how some of the largest American and British companies have learned to work with Indian firms.   According to Vohra's analysis, U.S. corporations reduce costs significantly by offshoring projects, and thus they free up resources to innovate, design and develop new products and ventures, which create new, higher-paying jobs and stimulates the economy. "It is the business of America to design and innovate," he writes.   Indian firms, in turn, are setting up more operations in America, generating thousands of new technology jobs. "You just have to look at the Silicon Valley today to realize how many new companies are being started by Indians," he notes.   The book identifies and analyzes the advantages for American companies of working with Indian firms. While demonstrating that the much-discussed cost savings are substantial and will continue well into the 21st century, Vohra also points out that Indian firms bring high quality and predictability to the process of IT software development. For example, of the 74 companies worldwide that have attained Level 5 of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) process, 50 are in India.   "The bottom line is that offshoring to India represents potential savings of 40 to 60 percent since there needs to be a mix of onsite and offshore activity. Hourly rates in India range from $20 to $30 an hour compared to the U.S. where they vary from $70 to $100 per hour," Vohra writes. "Even with the added cost of remote project management, these labor rates give tremendous savings."  urlLink MORE... .

       Truthfulness, Responsibility and Accountability in Outsourcing  The US senate has not stopped, they are finding the more effiecient and the wholesome ways to crack outsourcing.  urlLink Anti-BPO moves: Worse yet to come  - Times of India :    *  Bill, called  "Truthfulness, Responsibility and Accountability in Contracting Act of 2003" (TRAC Act), introduced in the US Senate last year, could halt outsourcing by the entire federal government, if it becomes law.     The objective of the TRAC Bill is "to ensure that the business of the federal government is conducted in the public interest and in a manner that provides for public accountability, efficient delivery of services, reasonable cost savings, and prevention of unwarranted Government expenses, and for other purposes".      The TRAC Bill refers to outsourcing as one of the components of "contracting out" which will be monitored by the General Accounting Office (GAO). The new Bill says that certifying agencies will have to be formed in each department to monitor all projects contracted out.     These agencies will have to report to the GAO that the procedures followed for outsourcing   are fair and transparent. These procedures have been put in place to make outsourcing as difficult as possible. *     Related:  *  urlLink Americans don't know what BPO is   *  urlLink Who are Outsourcing to India?

       The outsourcing reality for America  The American reality from  urlLink Wired.com :   * A century ago, 40 percent of Americans worked on farms. Today, the farm sector employs about 3 percent of our workforce. But our agriculture economy still outproduces all but two countries. Fifty years ago, most of the US labor force worked in factories. Today, only about 14 percent is in manufacturing. But we've still got the largest manufacturing economy in the world - worth about $1.9 trillion in 2002. We've seen this movie before - and it's always had a happy ending. The only difference this time is that the protagonists are forging pixels instead of steel. And accountants, financial analysts, and other number crunchers, prepare for your close-up. Your jobs are next. After all, to export sneakers or sweatshirts, companies need an intercontinental supply chain. To export software or spreadsheets, somebody just needs to hit Return.    What makes this latest upheaval so disorienting for Americans is its speed. Agriculture jobs provided decent livelihoods for at least 80 years before the rules changed and working in the factory became the norm. Those industrial jobs endured for some 40 years before the twin pressures of cheap competition overseas and labor-saving automation at home rewrote the rules again. IT jobs - the kind of high-skill knowledge work that was supposed to be our future - are facing the same sort of realignment after only 20 years or so. The upheaval is occurring not across generations, but within individual careers. The rules are being rewritten while people are still playing the game. And that seems unjust.    Couple those changed rules with the ham-fisted public relations of the American companies doing the outsourcing and it's understandable why programmers are so pissed. It makes sense that they're lashing out at the H1-B and L-1 visas. US immigration policies are a proxy for forces that are harder to identify and combat. It's easier to attack visible laws than it is to restrain the invisible hand. To be sure, many of these policies, especially the L-1, have been abused. American programmers have done an effective job of highlighting these abuses - and during an election year, Congress will likely enact some reforms. But even if these visa programs were eliminated altogether, not much would change in the long run. *   [ urlLink The New Face of the Silicon Age : Page.4]

       Outsourcing sentiments  [ Through : Anand] A WIRED.com article -  urlLink The New Face of the Silicon Age How India became the capital of the computing revolution and SLASHDOT.com discussion - urlLink A Thoughtful Look at Indian Outsourcing  and last and the least, my  urlLink explaination  over heated sentiments on slashdot.    SNAPSHOTS:   * "Why continue to argue about it, just don't do business with companies that outsource to India. " *     * There is virtually nothing anyone can do about outsourcing - and the fast developing intellectual capital resources of the rest of the world - that will insulate American workers, with the exception of regressive protectionism (which will result in an even worse situation). *    * In fact, *anyone* who's occupation does not *require* face-to-face contact is at risk of displacement, long-term.    The next big 'thing' will be social entrepreneurial plays that bring social and fiscal efficiencies into mature capitalism, on a large scale. Also, people will learn - in general, and long-term - to be happy with somewhat more limited material horizons (and probably enjoy life more). This is as plain as day, and already in the cards.    Politicians will not/cannot do anything to abate the outsourcing trend. Why? Because capital is "on the wire", and doesn't know national boundaries any longer. Corporations answer only to fiscal mandates, created by law. Game over!    So, say "ta-ta" to the gravy train; let's learn to optimize our intellectual and social capital, learn to cooperate (intra- and inter-nationally), and become creatively and commercially fierce (like the rest of the world).  *    * In any case us western countries have had the lion's share of the distribution of wealth for far too long at the expense of poorer nations. I don't think we have the right to complain if an Indian coder takes our job. *    * India has some of the highest import tarrifs in the world, local content laws, and property ownership laws. *    Related discussion on slashdot :    *  urlLink Do You Make $60/hr for Programming?

       Open Source is not free and we don't come cheap  Microsoft and collaboration suggests that Linux and opensource is afterall  urlLink COSTLY .      In fact, over the years a branch of that open source Unix, called Linux, spread its market share (mainly at the cost of Unix) and Microsoft has grudgingly begun to acknowledge its power. But as some of the companies present at the Friday's Microsoft meeting--NDPL, Goderj, CDSL and Pacsoft Solutions--indicated that it is too much of a bother to have "eventually costly" open source and it was best to work with Microsoft. They listed how they faced difficulties working on Unix/Linux and losing their mails or getting them "after 22 days" and how their lives have been changed for the better by getting back to Microsoft products.      On the other hand they are  urlLink opening up their source code  under Microsoft's Government Security Program (GSP).     Microsoft and everybody else should understand the basic defination "FREE AS IN FREEDOM NOT IN PRICE". Did you get it dudes?.

       Kill (Bill) Outsourcing  Even though  urlLink The Wall Street  feels that the outsourcing is a good business:   ["In the 1980s, many people boycotted companies that did business with the apartheid regime in South Africa," Kirwin said.

Would it be the same, if votes were outsourced?. Could this be indo-american  urlLink cold war .    The World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , has revealed that the export of Information Technology and other hi-tech jobs to India , China and Brazil and manufacturing jobs to countries like Mexico is  urlLink shaking faith in globalisation  even among its most fervent advocates.    However there can be a  urlLink bright side  to this :  [ there could be an upside to this imbroglio; leading Indian IT companies, most of which are sitting on huge cash piles, will now be forced to be far more aggressive in acquiring US and European IT companies. "We must continue to move up the value chain and evolve such solutions and services which are good and cost-effective, and Indian IT companies must diversify to other markets," said IT minister Arun Shourie. Experts agree that Shourie's advice is the only suitable long-term solution to combat this phenomenon. "Now they have to aggressively become truly global players instead of thinking in terms of exports from India," said Vaibhav Parikh, a BPO and intellectual property expert.]      Last but not the least, International Herald Tribune  urlLink Reports  that, not only jobs but even executives are heading for india

       Protesting against the Myth  A new report by  urlLink Zelos Group  attempts to debunk what it says are "myths"about offshoring call centers.      ""The report Business Process Outsourcing: Focus on India that compares cost between onshore and offshore outsourcing, says, contrary to belief that outsourcing is only for large firms, that a global sourcing strategy can be effective for companies with sales of less than $200 million.   Answering concerns about agent quality Zelos found Indian call center agents possess the same (if not higher) quality as American call center agents. Indian call center employees all possess quality, college-level educations and were highly motivated to excel at their jobs.   Also top level bureaus offer effective accent-neutralization classes. In many cases, an accent is not detectable.   The Zelos paper asserts that call centers and other outsourcing operations moving to India will help the country become more stable."""  urlLink More on CommWeb ...     US is witnessing reduction in jobs but well known economists have different say on that but anti-outsourcing and anti-india sentiments are so sharp that (again) you can see    urlLink protest  against  urlLink Nasscom .

       Lion's Share in Outsourcing - India  Channel News Asia reports -  urlLink India to keep lion's share of global outsourcing business  .    According to our conservative estimates, India enjoyed a 60 percent share of the international offshore call centre business in 2002," Evan Kirchheimer, analyst with British research group Datamonitor, told an outsourcing conference in New Delhi this week.  "That will go down to 52 percent in 2007 as South Korea, China, Mexico and South Africa make inroads into the business," he said at the conference, called "Contact Centre India" and attended by over 200 foreign company representatives.  "But there is no doubt that India will continue to be the biggest supplier of offshore call centres and enjoy a lion's share of the business," he said.

From an American security standpoint ''it is an outrageously risky and irresponsible practice,'' the signature campaign said.  At least nine bills are pending in the US Congress seeking to bar foreign workers from government contracts.  Legislation is also pending in at least four states-- Michigan, Indiana, North Carolina and New Jersey-- to restrict government IT contracts to US citizens or legal immigrants.

       Round table on jobs outsourcing   Heather Tomlinson reports in Guardian -  urlLink Round table on jobs outsourcing  ... Trade unions are setting up a public inquiry into the flow of British jobs abroad, following a government-inspired "round table" of opposing sides in the  debate yesterday. Trade unions and employees have become increasingly alarmed at the transfer of jobs in the service sector to countries with lower wages, such as India. Operations such as call centres and back-office jobs are particularly affected, especially in financial services.

       Do You Believe in Free Beer or Free Speech ?  Nicholas Petreley is  urlLink uspet  about the developers who are violating the spirit of GPL license and creating their own versions of licensing. According to him the spirit of opensource is "share and share alike" and as Free Software Foundation puts it, it is free as in "free speech" and not free as in "free beer". The article further describes how developers have invented some license compromises.  Here's the crux of the matter: It's illegal to create and sell a proprietary application based on GPL code. Given the reality that people are always going to create proprietary applications, developers invented some license compromises that make it possible to build proprietary applications on open-source foundations.

       India Needs a  4G Forum  CIOL carries an article why  urlLink  India urged to embrace 4G  ? According to the experts advise India must move forward in setting up a 4G forum that can provide insights into the country&rsquo;s needs and capabilities in the area of 4G telecom networks.   Expressing the importance of having a 4G forum for the country, Jorge M Pereira, European Commission, Information Society Directorate General said that India should move forward in having a 4G forum that can provide insights into the country&rsquo;s needs and capabilities in the area of fourth generation telecom networks.     "This forum when formed, can address issues like R&D in 4G technologies, educating the industry about 4G, expanding wireless with an increase in demand, seamless mobility and utilizing technologies of higher frequency spectrum," Pereira added.      India as a country has got a big talent pool in terms of educational institutions and research organizations and this can help the country in early adoption of technologies like 4G. "India is very good in terms of talent, so the country can provide the talent manpower needed in the areas of computing infrastructure, signal processing, backbone networks, multiple access technologies, channel coding and VLSI," informed, Prof Shankar Lall Maskara from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.       Creation of such forum will boost the chances of India moving towards cutting edge technologies like 3G and 4G. "Establishment of 4G forum is essential for the country now. In fact I am going to meet up with the government of India representatives and very soon we will have this forum functioning as a body," said, Ramjee Prasad, Director, Center for TeleInFrastruktur (CTIF), Aalborg University, Denmark.

I was completely blown as I listened to the stories of these tenacious women," Mr. Khosla said. "I started crying." In his view, the microfinance initiatives he visited in India and Bangladesh last month ran more efficiently than most Silicon Valley organizations. "They have sophisticated credit algorithms," he said. "Does the woman own a buffalo? Some chickens? Does she have a toilet in her home? What kind of roofing material does her home have?

       The Shift In Software Licensing  Via  urlLink Information Week  : According to a survey of both software vendors and major business customers by IDC, up front license purchasing will soon be replaced by subscription-licensing plans, in which vendors and customers adopt a pay-as-you-go arrangement that extends over several years. Amy Mizoras Konary, program manager for software pricing and licensing at IDC points out the problem in the current licensing method: The problem with traditional licensing, she added, is that customers are often unable to track the amount of software they actually use, much less predict what they need. "Most customers are guessing on how much they're using, so they tend to overbuy," Konary said.

An anonymous reader writes "Builder.com, which is part of CNet.com, is now outsourcing some of their writing to India. The funny thing is, the editor claims it's not as much about money as because he's 'getting a better interface with producers of the content.' He claims CNet isn't giving up control, but if they're the publisher, and he's the editor, and they can't hire and manage their own writers, why shouldn't the Indians just put up their own website to replace CNet, and we can all read what they write direct? I mean, we're all going to be buying software direct from Indian companies soon, so why not?" Newsforge and Slashdot are both part of OSDN. OSDN also runs sites like devchannel.org which are more-or-less direct competitors of builder.com.

       WiMax : Growth or Hype  The 802.16 standard, otherwise known as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax), has been getting much hype over the past year as being the next biggest technology since Wi-Fi. Some analysts believe that WiMax poses a threat to the large mobile phone companies, most of which have already invested billions in other technologies to deliver voice and data over the airwaves (WiMax can cover a distance of 50 kilometers, ten times more than a 3G base station); e.g. EV-DO, a next-generation wireless network that delivers broadband service based on a technology called CDMA. The other side of the story can be found at  urlLink Alarmist WiMax Predictions  [WiFiNetNews | Fleishman's Blog]  For WiMax to pose a threat to any other wireless technology, it will need a major operator to commit to building an extensive network. That hasn&rsquo;t happened. Also, WiMax wouldn&rsquo;t pose a significant threat to 3G or Wi-Fi until the mobile version of the standard is complete. Once it&rsquo;s complete, vendors have to make equipment and that gear must be certified, then an operator must build a network. That process will take many years.

       Latest News via RSS   urlLink Topix.net  provides news on various topics and provides an RSS feed for the same. There is a similar site called  urlLink Newstrove.com  but topix.net feeds are more accurate, relevant and exhaustive. The advantage of Newstrove is that , it also offer Java Script which can be included in any web page, in case the web server doesn't support XML parsing. The twop indian news sites who have started XML syndications are  urlLink IndianExpress.com  and  urlLink Rediff.com , I don't know why  urlLink Timesofindia.com  which claims to be the number one Indian news site on the internet doesn't have one. The same is true for Googlenews.com which doesn't offer any RSS feeds. But there are many tools avialable on the net who parse the html to get RSS XML feeds out of them. This method is called "scarping" and it violates copyright, but still there are  urlLink many tools available  and I remember that there was something for Timesofindia.com too.      The convinience which these feeds offer are:   (1) You don't have to visit numerous news/content sites everyday, you can simply subscribe to the RSS feeds.   (2) These RSS feeds generally includes main home page (headlines) and also categorical and topical headlines. Thus I may subscribe only to Cricket feed from Rediff and business news feed from financial express.   (3) These feeds can be viewed in a web based aggregators likes  urlLink bloglines  or  urlLink blogstreet  and destop applicatications like  urlLink Feedreader .[all are free]   (4) Thus I save lots of browsing time and visit exactly the page whose title has generated interest.   (5) You can also use these topical feeds in your web pages, e.g. a cricket blogger or a web master may show latest headlines in his web page / blog side bar which adds more intelligence to his web page.   (6) Many others things can be done with this syndication method depending upon the creativity, the most interesting I find are  urlLink blagg   and  urlLink Rollup.org  which allows you to subsribe to various syndicated feeds and re-mix them. That is, the headlines are generally shown from one site , then another and then the next one in these aggregators all the individual feeds are randomly mixed and displayed.

       Stop whining about outsourcing, David Shaffer Suggests   urlLink According to the article , written by David Shaffer, president of the  urlLink  Public Policy Institute , an Albany-based think tank,said that the "one-sided" blame game of blaming India and outsourcing should stop.  "A lot of our legislators are looking at the scary news stories about call centers in India. They think they see a way to shift the blame. So, one bill after another is being introduced in the legislature to "crack down" on companies that employ people in other countries," claims Shaffer, while adding that only two of the legislators -- Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver have not joined this bandwagon. "Nothing in this or any of the other proposals would create one single job in New York State. But more important, anybody with even a marginal understanding of New York's economy should know that we gain far more from international trade than we lose," Shaffer's article further goes on to add.   He concludes by saying ... Fact is, we need to imitate India, not whine about it."

       The Myths of Open Source  Alhtough I am not agreeable to this, since I do not consider anyting as a holistic solution, still this article offers some points for discussion. John Alberg cofounder of Eployease in  urlLink CIO Magazine  elaborates how open-source was not able to meet all the needs and discolses the myths of using open source.  urlLink Eployease  provides employee benefits administration services to more than 1,000 organizations across America .  The myths discussed are... (1)  ATTRACTION IS THE PRICE TAG   (2) THE SAVINGS AREN'T REAL   (3) THERE'S NO SUPPORT   (4) IT'S A LEGAL MINEFIELD   (5) OPEN SOURCE ISN'T FOR MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS   (6) OPEN SOURCE ISN'T READY FOR THE DESKTOP       THE BOTTOM LINE :  Is open source right for every organization? In the end, argues Andy Mulholland, chief technology officer for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, it's a question of attitude. "The arguments for and against open-source software often get very trivialized," he says. "It's not a technology issue; it's a business issue to do with externalization."    Companies with an external focus, he says, which are used to working collaboratively with other organizations, and perhaps are already using collaborative technologies, stand to gain much more from open source than companies with an internal focus, which see the technology in terms of cost savings.    "The lesson of the Web is that standardization is better than differentiation," Mulholland claims. "Is there a virtue in doing things differently? Is there a virtue in doing things the same way as everybody else?" As the past decade has shown, standardization with a proprietary flavor&#8212;think Microsoft&#8212;has its drawbacks: bloatware, security loopholes, eye-popping license fees and an unsettling reliance upon a single vendor. In offices around the globe, an era of open-source standardization, determined to condemn such drawbacks to history, may be dawning.

       Two Way Street called Trade  HAL R. VARIAN writes in  New York times in the article :   urlLink What Goes Abroad Usually Comes Back, With Benefits  The article essentially tells us that any 'trade' is a two-way street.   The money paid to foreign producers, whether businesses or workers, typically comes back home to buy domestic goods and services, thereby generating domestic employment. That is true whether it is European companies paying American biotech researchers, or American companies paying Indian programmers.   Think about it. If Oracle sends $10,000 abroad to pay an Indian programmer, then that money either finds its way back to the United States or it doesn't. If it comes back, it can be used to buy American goods and services, employing American workers. If it doesn't come back then it's even better from the viewpoint of the country: we've sent them paper, while they've sent us valuable goods and services.

       India, the outsourcing scapegoat   urlLink James K. Glassman , a fellow at the  urlLink American Enterprise Institute  and host of  urlLink TechCentralStation.com  writes in his article  urlLink Don't make India the outsourcing scapegoat  on Post-Gazette. According to him Sen. John Kerry is fond of calling CEOs who employ foreigners " urlLink Benedict Arnolds ," after the despicable Revolutionary War turncoat, but there is lots of hipocracy involved in it.  Put hypocrisy aside. The traitors to American interests aren't CEOs seeking to boost profits that ultimately lead to more hiring at home. The real Benedict Arnolds are Kerry and his colleagues in Congress, such as Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., and Jon Corzine, D-N.J., who understand enough economics to know that outsourcing is trade and that trade -- as  urlLink David Ricardo  figured out 200 years ago and as Hillary's husband articulated in the 1990s -- benefits both parties.   He feels that India is unnecessarily made a target and the whole election campaign is biased against it without seeing the bigger picture.   Now, many Indians feel they are the scapegoats for America's cyclical economic downturn in what they see as a racist campaign. Isn't this the way trade works? "On the one hand you talk about opening up our markets. On the other, you want to ban ... outsourcing," said India's deputy prime minister.    In fact, the business processes (or BP) work that Indians do for companies worldwide is a "good thing," as  urlLink Gregory Mankiw , head of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, had the temerity to say, like the little boy who couldn't help but speak the truth while his elders were telling lies. ("This simple restatement of the logic of liberal trade brought derision down on Mankiw's head," wrote The Economist. And from, among others, Corzine, the former CEO of Goldman, Sachs!)    As the BP sector waxes, India becomes a bigger market for "Dell personal computers, Cisco switches and Avaya telecommunications equipment," writes  urlLink Rafiq Dossani  of Stanford in Outlook, an Indian magazine.

       The growth in Data Services  Via  urlLink Hindustantimes.com : Whoever has the bandwidth will rule the world and whoever know how to manage it will be the king. The next phase of telecom growth will be in the enterprise network management and services. Reliance Infocomm and Tata's will add huge manpower in 2004-05 to introduce these services. Data services like broadband conncectivity, VPN, Leased Lines, Wireless Data Access would see a huge demand in the Indian market.      * Telecoms companies are scrambling to meet the burgeoning demand for international access and specialised data services that has accompanied a boom in the Indian economy and its outsourcing industry.    Local firms that offer international phone services, such as Bharti Tele-Ventures, Reliance Infocomm and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd are now eyeing the lucrative data market. And global carriers such as AT&T Corp and Cable & Wireless Plc are clamouring for a piece of the action.    "Everybody wants a chunk of the data business," said Kobita Desai, telecoms analyst at Gartner India Research and Advisory Services. "It's still a niche area, but a high-margin one."    Spending on data services in India is likely to double to 50 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) in four years, according to Rajiv Sharma, CEO of Bharti Tele-ventures broadband and data division.  *

       Outsourcing and the property business  Umesh Desai and Dominic Whiting reports in Forbes [  urlLink India outsourcing surge hits rich Asia's property  ]. Due to current boom in the outsourcing and BPO industry in the region the property sector is also riding on the wave and making profits.      * For India, the influx of jobs due to "business process outsourcing" (BPO) is a shot in the arm for a property sector that had been languishing.     In 2004, 11 million square feet (1.022 million sq metres) of office space is expected to be taken up in India's five biggest cities, nearly twice 2002's 6.4 million.     "Two years ago the market was in the doldrums because of the India-Pakistan tensions and a global recession was not allowing multinationals to grow in emerging markets," said Chanakya Chakravarti, executive director at property services firm Cushman & Wakefield India.     "The BPO boom in the past two to three years has led to a resurgence in the Indian property market across segments."     Call centres and other information technology firms accounted for 82 percent of the total office space let in New Delhi and its surrounding areas in the first half of 2003. They took up 51 percent in Bombay and 81 percent in Bangalore.     The $3.6 billion industry is seen rocketing to $13.8 billion by 2007, with the number of jobs quadrupling to one million. *

       The Outsourcing Discussion : Slashdot Again  Again on Slashdot:  urlLink The full outsourcing discussion  posted on  urlLink Slashdot.org  by  urlLink Hemos .   GileadGreene writes "Thomas Friedman of the New York Times recently did an interesting Op-Ed piece [ urlLink The silver lining of outsourcing overseas  ] about the "silver lining of overseas outsourcing": the growth that it generates in the US job market as Indian companies outsource work that US workers are better at. Apparently total exports from US companies to India have grown from $2.5 billion in 1990 to $4.1 billion in 2002 as well. So maybe this outsourcing thing isn't so bad after all." Ultimately, free trade works out well; I think one of the issues is that white collar jobs are just beginning to feel the pinch, and are acting like manufacturers did in the 1970s and 1980s.

       Hidden Spyware : Ignorance is not a bliss   According to the  urlLink WebSense  press release:  92 Percent of Organizations with at Least 100 Employees Have Been Contaminated With Spyware, Yet Only Six Percent of Employees Believe They Have Been Infected    Forty percent of IT managers report the number of spyware-infected workstations has increased in past year, according to Websense survey    According to Websense&rsquo;s fifth annual Web@Work survey conducted by Harris Interactive&reg;, there is a major discrepancy between employees&rsquo; knowledge and understanding of spyware versus IT managements&rsquo; findings on the number of corporate workstations that are actually infected. For example, one-third of employees either do not believe, or are unsure, that their computers could be infected with spyware. However, IT management reported that spyware was on the rise&#8212;of those that acknowledged they had a spyware infection, forty percent believe that the number of spyware-infected workstations at their organization has increased.   One of the most common ways for an employee to download spyware is by using a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application such as KaZaa or Morpheus. Many P2P users do not realize that by downloading a seemingly harmless mp3 file, it may be accompanied by a spyware application. By connecting users directly to each other to download or swap files, P2P networks bypass normal security barriers and can be easily exploited by hackers to spread spyware.    "Employees are typically exposed to spyware as a parasitic program that is attached to something useful they've intentionally downloaded from the Internet, or been tricked into downloading, or it is surreptitiously loaded by a malicious hacker," said Peter Firstbrook, program manger at META Group. "Most employees don't even know they are infected; however, spyware can be merely a nuisance, clogging the network with advertising traffic or pestering the user with pop up ads; or it can be an invasion of privacy and collect what sites they've been browsing on; or less often, a security threat that records keystrokes or screenshots that reveal confidential corporate information and potentially create backdoors by revealing passwords and user names."

       Emergic Mailserv  On  urlLink Emergic  :  urlLink CXOToday  has put up a case study about FCB Ulka's deployment of our Linux-based messaging solution - Emergic  urlLink MailServ - developed by  urlLink Netcore      According to Kalpit Jain, CTO of Netcore, “The solution that runs only on Linux, has an anti-virus application, armed with a firewall, enhanced with load balancing features apart from bandwith management and monitoring. The mail server has been placed in the DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)- a server zone, which is accessible to the public as well as to the private network. In other words, it separates the internal network from the outside world.”     Commenting about the inherent benefits, Madbhavi cited reliability, flexibility coupled with ease of administration and simplicity. “However,” acknowledged Madbhavi, “Netcore was able to execute a high degree of customization primarily because the solution was built on open source.”      “Emergic Mailserv has been built with a judicious mix of certain open source components alongwith internally developed software,” affirmed Jain.      Spelling the minimum technical requirements, Jain stated that for 25 users a P III with a 64 MB RAM with 20 GB hard disk is needed.      Founded in 1998, Netcore Solutions Pvt Ltd. is an enterprise solutions company, focused on messaging, collaboration, and security software offering a range of enterprise products and hosted services. Among its several corporate customers using this solution are IDBI Bank and Raymonds.

We need to do something about addressing. We need an easy system that assigns each person a persistent address that is useful for all applications; ideally the system would be distributed and resistant to attack or capture. Current Web Services specifications work on the problem of trust without solving the problem of addressing--that is, the problem as I've stated it, the problem of finding someone several hours later    Related :   urlLink The Next Level of Social Networking  Red Herring (Registration Required)

        Is Linux Safe and Secure ?   An article on Slashdot provides discussion on "is the closed code here being held to a higher standard than its open-source equivalent, and does this change the 'security through obscurity' argument?"    Comment # 1 (it's open source honey)   "Open Source is actually more secure than closed source proprietary software because the oversight of technology content is broader and deeper. Instead of just one company monitoring its own contributions &#8212; or potentially hiding security holes and exploits &#8212; a worldwide community of interested parties actually oversees Linux to make it strong and secure. That's why the NSA &#8212; the most security-conscious organization in the world &#8212; chose to standardize on Linux, and even supplies its own version of secure Linux."     Another Comment (It's on my PC and used by Military Too ???)   "Frankly, even as a faithful Linux user, I still have to agree with him.

       IIT Incubator :KReSIT  Venkatesh Hariharan writes on TR :  urlLink Can India Plug Its Brain Drain?  : IIT Bombay is using its technology  urlLink  incubator  to counter the exodus of its brightest graduates to the West   About  urlLink KReSIT :  The Kanwal Rekhi School of Information Technology (KReSIT) aims at moulding the future leaders of the Indian IT industry by imparting world class IT education to them. The school formally started operations with the first batch of M.Tech students on July 19, 1999.    Background :  The Indian IT industry is expanding rapidly and is expected to grow tremendously over the next few years. While the current education in India has been producing high quality 'workers' for the IT industry, there is a distinct lack of people who are trained to be leaders in this industry: people who will shape its future. There is also the disturbing trend of extreme compartmentalization that has gradually crept into the engineering sciences, especially in academic circles. While this may promote research in each of those fields themselves, it must be acknowledged that there are hardly any real problems that can be dealt with in isolation by any one 'compartment' of engineering. These were some of the issues noticed by  urlLink  Prof. D.B. Phatak  (the current head of the school) and others, and a proposal was made in March 1998 to start a School of IT in IIT Bombay. The focus of the school was to be a close interaction with the industry, research with focus on integration of the various 'compartments', and entrepreneurship. The proposal was accepted and funding for starting the School came from two alumni of IIT Bombay, Nandan Nilekhani and Kanwal Rekhi, both of whom made generous contributions. Read more on this  urlLink here .     The successful companies who have now  urlLink moved out  of the incubation are :    *  urlLink Herald Logic   : Develops products in enterprise information, rule-based engines.    *  Voyager2 Infotech  : Raised USD 250K, built a .creative ideas. portal, and was bought out by Purple Yogi in an all-stock deal.    *   urlLink Myzus   : Raised USD 600K, develops products and services in the areas of wireless gateways and connectivity bridges. It moved out into its own premises and is looking for a second round of funding.     *  urlLink eInfinitus  :Raised Rupees 1.2 crore, develops products in network operations: real-time bandwidth provisioning and specialized router software.

       PC for RS.5000  Rajesh Jain on Emergic  urlLink writes  about the need for low cost computers in India.  To take computing to the masses in India, we need to rethink the design of the personal computer. In the late 1970s and early 1980s when the PC was architected, networks did not exist. The PC was, in effect, a standalone device. This is no longer the case now. Local area networks and broadband networks offer high-speed, always-on connectivity. In addition, the continuous progress in semiconductors has ensured that processing power is available quite inexpensively. As a result, it is possible to think of a &#8220;thin client&#8221; with processing and storage taking place on a &#8220;thick server.&#8221; This disruptive innovation is the Rs 5,000 PC (5KPC).     The need....   * 1 million schools need 10 computers each for enabling primary and secondary education  * 100,000 colleges need 100 computers each to ensure digitally literate graduates  * 3 million small- and medium-sized enterprises need to computer-enable their 30 million information-driven workforce  * 40 million urban and semi-urban families need a computer   * 5 million staff in government need computers to build the foundation for electronic and efficient governance  * 5,000 hubs in rural India need 1,000 computers each to provide newer opportunities beyond agriculture and provide a foundation for transforming Bharat

       Rural Infrastucture & Services Commons (RISC)   urlLink Antanu Day  writes : urlLink  RISC, Deeshaa, and Rajesh Jain -- The story so far  on Deesha.org an entrepreneurial institution, which aims to transform the rural Indian economy and contribute to India's economic development. He throws some light on  urlLink Rural Infrastucture & Services Commons (RISC)  which  is an economic model & has the potential for achieving the multi-faceted goals of sustainable economic development through more efficient utilization of available resources.  I had been thinking about the problem of India's economic development for a long time. Even though my undergraduate work was in mechanical engineering, and my postgraduate work in computer sciences, I decided to study economics primarily because I wanted to understand how economic growth could be catalysed. Around 1998, I started converging to the idea that urbanization is both a cause and consequence of development. But rural India was huge. Massive rural to urban migration is not an option for India. So I started thinking of some way of "urbanizing" rural India in rural India itself. RISC was born.

       Google : Trying To Become Microsoft Of Information   urlLink Rajesh Jain  comments on Google that it is trying to be  urlLink Microsoft of Information  over the web. Recently Google  urlLink launched a test  with about 1,000 invited guests set to try out a new e-mail service called " urlLink Gmail ."  Gmails's highlights are as follows :    Search : Built on Google search technology, Gmail enables people to quickly search every email they've ever sent or received. Using keywords or advanced search features, Gmail users can find what they need, when they need it.      Storage : Google believes people should be able to hold onto their mail forever. That's why Gmail comes with 1,000 megabytes (1 gigabyte) of free storage – more than 100 times what most other free webmail services offer.      Speed : Gmail makes using email faster and more efficient by eliminating the need to file messages into folders, and by automatically organizing individual emails into meaningful "conversations" that show messages in the context of all the replies sent in response to them. And it turns annoying spam e-mail messages into the equivalent of canned meat.    Before you start considering this as a joke John Battelle's Searchblog has an  urlLink unconfirmed response from Yahoo! . Whatever it may be I M LOVIN IT .

In this way Pacenet can work out promotional deals with broadcasters as they will have an exact idea of how much their channels are being watched. Unlike Reliance the company did not have to worry about laying fibre optic cables throughout the country thanks to the recent tie up with Ipstar. This is the worlds first two way satellite system and provides a two way IP link. This will allow Pacenet to reach any part of the country. But according to Pacenet they are aiming to provide Cable on IP and not Video on Demand like Reliance which offers everything (various data services) on the Ethernet. Pacenet further adds that Reliance project requires more maturity in the market. Let's see whos gonna rule the indian broadband world and when will have my connection.

       The Shift In Linux Loyalty  Daniel Lyons  urlLink writes on Forbes.com  about 'Once Upon A Time Linux Fan ' Rick Carey when he was a  chief technology architect at Merrill Lynch. Carey now holds a different view altogether due to changing policies of Red Hat w.r.t to pricing and licensing.   Carey says one reason he embraced Linux was its lower cost. But if Linux becomes almost as expensive as Windows, why not go with Windows, and benefit from the work of thousands of Microsoft engineers and programmers? Carey talks about "the innovation premium"--meaning the price you pay to get the latest and greatest.     "Most open source is imitation," Carey says. "Linux is an imitation of an operating system. If these [Linux] companies are going to create a price point that is significant enough that they are approaching the same pricing model as the innovation premium, why pay a premium for imitation when I can pay a premium and get innovation?"

       Google Made Simple = Soople   urlLink Soople (Easy Expert Search)   is a simple query interface to google.com which has various hacks besides just generating answers to simple queries. Google can find definitions, calculate, work as yellow pages, suggest products, can search a specific domain or a university or can search particular type of document or topic. Accessing these features requires a particular syntaxed query, soople makes it easy for you , basically it provides pre-formatted search boxes for various options instead of typing a special syntaxed query.  Soople is an early English dialect, which means 'to soften, make supple'.     That's exactly what I envisioned for this site ; a site that softens all the fantastic (advanced) functions Google offers. Initially I made this site for my mother, who, though computer-savvy, still didn't know about all the possibilities Google offers. This site is therefore meant for all those who are not yet familiar with all the functions and required syntaxes. This way Soople enables an 'easy expert search'!     For instance, one can specify a search by one particuliar site or filetype ( word, excel, powerpoint and pdf) or an imagesearch by size and type.     Furthermore there are many useful tools Google offers; search in the latest news, look up definitions or use Google as a phonebook.     And last but not least, the Calculator. This amazing tool let's you do all kind of (very advanced) calculations. Soople has added the unit-converter, which is based on this calculator, for the conversion of all the commmon units/measures (meters yards). Quite supple, if you ask me.     Of course, there are always many more supple ideas out there, so don't hesitate to mail us! Have a lot of Google-fun     Soople is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Google

Such an inquiry is especially relevant today when the world's largest democracy is also a nuclear power, a potentially major economic power poised to emerge as the second largest consumer market in the world, and a growing force in information technology. Misconceptions about India and Indians abound, fed by the stereotypes created by foreigners, and the myths about themselves projected by Indians. In Being Indian, urlLink  Pavan K.Varma  demolishes these myths and generalizations as he turns his sharply observant gaze on his fellow countrymen to examine what really makes Indians tick and what they have to offer the world in the 21st century.    Varma's insightful analysis of the Indian personality and the culture that has created it reaches startling new conclusions on the paradoxes and contradictions that characterize Indian attitudes towards issues such as power, wealth and spirituality. How, for example, does the appalling indifference of most Indians to the suffering of the poor and the inequities of the caste system square with their enthusiastic championing of parliamentary democracy? And why do Indians have a reputation for being spiritual and `other-worldly' when their philosophy and tradition exalt the pursuit of material well-being &#8212;artha&#8212;as a principal goal of life? The book also examines India's future prospects as an economic, military and technological power, providing valuable pointers to the likely destiny of a nation of one billion people.    Drawing on sources as diverse as ancient Sanskrit treatises and Bollywood lyrics, and illuminating his examples with a wealth of telling anecdotes, Pavan Varma creates a vivid and compelling portrait of Indians as he argues that they will survive and flourish in the new millennium precisely because of what they are, warts and all, and not because of what they think they are or would like to be. This book, which will stimulate reflection, discussion and controversy, is a must read for both foreigners who wish to understand Indians and Indians who wish to understand themselves.         ( About the Auhtor :Pavan K. Varma graduated with honours in history from St Stephens College, Delhi, and took a degree in law from Delhi University. A member of the Indian Foreign Service, he is at present Director of the Nehru Centre in London. He is the author of Ghalib: The Man, The Times; Krishna: The Playful Divine, The Great Indian Middle Class; The Book of Krishna; and Maximize Your Life (with Renuka Khandekar), all published by Penguin.

       Its A Small Planet  Via  urlLink Geekzone  : SmallPlanet.com has launched social networking site on Mobile Phones (GPRS & Bluetooth):  SmallPlanet's CrowdSurfer technology was tested on the UCLA campus. Limited to Nokia 6600 and 6230 phones only (which reduces the level of social networking by limiting options, in my opinion), the application uses Bluetooth to find other users up to 100 feet away, and relationship information is made available via GPRS connections to the SmallPlanet.net Web site. "This is true location-based, mobile social networking," says SmallPlanet's Ken Torimaru, who led the development of CrowdSurfer. "We are giving users the option to know when friends are nearby and to meet new people with whom they share some common, previously invisible connection, and we're doing it in the real world; in real time, in real place."

       Rajesh Jain : The Daily Blogger  Rajesh Jain  urlLink writes , how he is able to keep up with his blog  urlLink Emergic.org .  When I started, I was clear about one thing: that the blog would be updated daily. And except for two weekend days just after I started, that has been the case. It is a lesson I learnt from the IndiaWorld days: you have to become a daily part of the life of your readers. This is also what I tell every person who I recommend blogging to &#8211; have something new everyday. It is not difficult; it just requires a discipline and determination. It daily blogging is a commitment we make, our readers will reciprocate by making a daily visit. Given that there is so much happening everyday and our minds are constantly active and thinking, it is not a very difficult thing to do. Near-ubiquitous connectivity, even when one is travelling, makes posting a trivial exercise.    What has spurred the writing revolution for me is the ease of the blogging tool. Using MovableType is very easy. I am not dependent on any other person for posting to the blog. Once the blog has been set up, no technical expertise is needed. This simplicity of the blogging tools has laid the foundation for the two-way web that we are seeing emerge around us.     Also read his  urlLink views  on Andra Pradesh Election Verdit 2004.  Back to the question. What went wrong for Naidu, and before him Digvijay Singh? In two words, rising expectations. While there is an anti-incumbency element (people's desire for a change), there's much more to it. People want a lot more and a lot faster. They want a basic quality of life that most of the Indian governments have still not been able to deliver. Development for the most part has been uneven. In a democracy, there is "one person, one vote." And sometimes, we living in the cities forget that there is another India that has barely changed. [Read my "Rajasthan Ruminations" written after a visit earlier in the year.] Education, Electricity, Water, Opportunities - we are still not able to provide these to the majority of Indians. And the elections are the only time they can have their say.

       Craig Silverstein's : The Man of Google   Via  urlLink Slashdot  :  Craig Silverstein is the  employee No. 1 & the  technology director of world No.1 Search Engine & the only company which is giving Microsoft a tough time. Silverstein, 31, left his doctoral studies at Stanford University in 1998, joining school chums Sergey Brin and Larry Page in a nearby garage to build "the Google". Google  is poised to raise US$2.7 billion in one of the hottest tech initial public offerings since 2000. Imminent wealth aside, Silverstein has long been a champion of working hard and whistling while you do it. As Google's director of technology, he balances pie-in-the-sky visions for search -- in other words, artificially intelligent search pets -- and churning out products that improve people's access to information. Just a sampling includes new technology to personalise the company's Web site; comparative shopping prices on wireless devices; and the ability to send, store and manage up to 1 gigabyte of free e-mail, otherwise known as Gmail.     In an  urlLink interview before Google's IPO filing [ZDnet] , Silverstein discussed the backlash against Gmail among privacy advocates, the company's cultural changes and its shifting reliance on PageRank, the mathematical algorithm that has helped Google shine. The company recently renewed an exclusive PageRank licence from Stanford that's valid through 2011.

       Social Networking : Hype or Business   urlLink David Coursey  writes on the week, why he consider all this social networking as  urlLink some hype & no business  :   These are meant to be membership services that link people with like interests, which is what Yahoo Groups do quite nicely for free.    These things are really nothing new. Since the beginning of the Internet boom people have talked about making money by creating communities. Some have done it, but lots more have failed. For every AOL there are six to ten TalkCity's.     I don't believe people will pay lots of money for contacts. But, I can see a demand for the services to split their revenue with the people who actually own the contacts. For example, want an introduction to Rob Enderle? He's a friend and if I asked him to meet with you, I bet he would. So don't pay LinkedIn, pay me. After all, LinkedIn is just a service, the contact is mine. But how legit is a paid introduction, do you really want your friends selling you to the highest bidder?    On the other hand, if people can find a use for these networks, they'd probably pay a $10 monthly fee to belong. But not more, unless these are high-value (i.e. sexual or whatever) relationships we're creating.    This is another get-rich-quick-scheme that will disappear within a year or so. Someone will make a little money here, but&#8230;    I just don't see a very interesting business opportunity here. At least not for "legit" services. However, some vendors are like conferencing that support a better business model than paid introductions.   On the other hand a survey has found out that One In Five  urlLink 'Net Users Have Visited A Social Networking Site :   survey of more than 9,200 Internet users' Web habits finds that one in five has visited a social networking site, according to a survey by BURST! Media, an Internet ad services company.     The survey found that 19.2 percent of respondents say they have visited a social networking Web site such as Friendster or Tribe.net. Of those respondents, half (50.5 percent) actually registered and joined these sites. Men were slightly more likely than women to say they have visited a social networking Web site (21.7 percent versus 16.7 percent). However, women are more likely to register and join (53.3 percent versus 47.9 percent).      Related Links:  urlLink Social Networking Services Meta List

       The Technology : Use & Applications  Technology evangelist Sam Pitroda tells in an  urlLink  interview :   * Technology in India is urbane, elitist, exotic, intimidating and sexy   * What is needed is that it should reach the rural masses   * There are two reasons we need telecommunications and IT. They not only can only help Indians create wealth, they can also create wealth of their own. Unless we have both, we have no future as a nation   * High technology can put unequal human beings on an equal footing. But this whole information revolution has not been clearly understood by people in India. They think they are somehow not going to be affected by it.    On the other hand, Genevieve Bell, an anthropologist employed by Intel Research, has visited 100 households in 19 cities in seven countries overr the two years, in Asia and the Pacific to study  urlLink how people use technology   Some of what she learned in the field will be folded into Intel's design process, passed on to industrial designers and engineers and perhaps eventually embodied in a device. But many of Bell's findings also raise deep questions about the meaning of technology in an interconnected world.     Her fieldwork project began four years ago with the insight that Intel might have a misconception about the potential users of its products elsewhere in the world.    "We thought, there's a group of people just like us all over the world who will buy the technology and have it fill the same values in their lives," Bell said. "I was fairly certain that wasn't going to be the case. I'm an anthropologist. Culture matters."     Bell, 37, who received her doctorate in anthropology from Stanford University with a dissertation on American Indian boarding schools, joined Intel in 1998. She is working on a book for MIT Press about her Asian research.    Bell's project sent her to seven countries: India, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Australia. She found that in some places, "It's harder for some forms of technology to get over the threshold of the home" -- not simply for economic reasons but for religious ones as well. For example, she said, values of humility and simplicity may make technology less welcome in some Hindu homes in India or some Muslim homes in Malaysia and Indonesia.   * More on  urlLink Taipeitimes.com ...   .

       Inshoring, Nearshoring,  Rightshoring & Microsourcing  Warren Vieth  urlLink reports  about Inshoring, Nearshoring,  Rightshoring & Microsourcing :   The business of finding low-cost substitutes for American workers is getting more complex -- and so is the terminology. They don't just call it "offshoring" anymore.    At a recent conference, the people who help U.S. companies shift white-collar work overseas offered potential clients a buffet of outsourcing options: "nearshoring," for those willing to stray no farther than Canada or Mexico; "inshoring," for those who prefer to bring foreign workers to America; and "rightshoring," for those desiring a custom package of in-house and off-site, foreign and domestic.    For the faint of heart, there's "microsourcing." Don't fire your entire computer department, advised David Elmo, president of Ohio-based Corbus Corp. Instead, farm out chronic backlogs and special projects to programmers in India.    "Getting rid of everyone puts you at a strategic disadvantage," said Elmo, whose company will help supply the foreign talent. "You don't know what's going to happen tomorrow."

       Indian Broadband Race  The broadband race in India is picking up. Anand Parthasarathy in The Hindu  urlLink Reports  about the broadband happening in India and also informs about the types of broadband and its features. The report covers the broadband initiative of the players like ...  * BSNL's Direct Internet Access Service (DIAS)  * Dishnet's DSL  * ZeeNext's Ethernet  * Sify Infoway 's WiFi  * Reliance Telecom's  WiMax     Another Story from  urlLink Business World India  (TRAI's broadband recommendations : Shake-up signals)       UNBUNDLE, compete, achieve. That, in short, is the message of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) final recommendations on broadband in India. The 113-page paper defines broadband as an always-on data connection with a minimum capacity of 256 kbps. But the meat really is in its 12-odd recommendations, some of which are bound to cause mayhem.  If adopted together, they could take India to 20 million broadband subscribers by 2010 reckons Trai chairman Pradip Baijal. He reckons the recommendations will help "slaughter the prices of broadband". Kunal Bajaj, the consultant for Trai who worked on the report, reckons that two recommendations are key for that - reducing the cost of equipment and unbundling.  urlLink Read more  on Business World     urlLink Broadband India:Recommendations on Accelerating Growth of Internet and Broadband Penetration [PDF]      Executive Summary of Recommendations     In April 2002, India was adding 0.28 million new mobile phone connections per month. Tariffs were high and fixed by the regulator, with only a couple of operators in each circle. Today, operators are adding almost 2 million new mobile subscribers per month, almost 8 times that of April 2002. Many regulatory steps were taken to arrive at today's scenario by allowing enhanced competition and reduced costs to benefit consumers. While not all steps were accepted instantly by operators or the public, today consumers and the overall market are in a much better situation. Internet and broadband roll-out has the ability to have even farther reaching effects than the reforms in telephony did. Not only will broadband enable people to communicate with each other, but also to do business more efficiently over longer distances, be better educated, have access to better health services, benefit from better governance, and have enhanced entertainment services. Availability of broadband services at affordable pricelevels will have significant impact on gross domestic product (GDP) and attract new investment, create jobs and a larger more qualified labor pool, and increase productivity through infrastructure creation and access to new and improved services. While internet growth rates in India have been flat, and at times declining over the past three years, other countries like Korea, China and Malaysia have been doubling and tripling the size of their internet and broadband subscriber base. India currently has 0.4 internet connections and 0.02 broadband connections per 100 persons, while Korea has 25 and China has 1.4 broadband connections per 100 persons, with its current level 50% higher than what it was just six months ago. Korea has achieved its success story in a span of less than five years, going from less than 1 broadband subscriber per 100 persons in 1999 to the levels it has reached today. By 2002, nearly 30% of their GDP was transacted on broadband. The lessons that India learns from these examples can be applied to our current situation to realize the same explosive success. In this document, the Authority has identified eleven major hurdles preventing growth of internet and broadband services. These hurdles include:    *  Price  1. Subscription prices of broadband services in India are 60 times higher than those in Korea, which translates to 1,200 times higher when considering purchasing power (Paragraph 1.8)    * Access to the customer in the last mile   2. Lack of access to copper in the local loop and the high costs of duplicating this existing infrastructure (Section 3.4)   3. Low quality of cable TV infrastructure and the lack of organization in that industry which makes upgrade difficult (Section 3.5)   4. High costs of using DTH and VSAT technologies, and restrictions preventing them from being used for delivering broadband internet services (Section 3.6)   5. Policies preventing terrestrial wireless solutions from being effective alternatives to bridging the last mile to customers (Section 3.7)   6. Barriers in obtaining right of way clearances that are stalling network installation efforts (Section 3.9)    * Costs of backhaul networks   7. High prices in domestic leased circuits, even though there are multiple competing players (Section 4.1.5)   8. High costs of international leased circuits and problem with access to landing stations (Section 4.1.6)   9. Ineffectiveness of NIXI thus far to be able to deliver on its objectives (Section 4.2)    * Fiscal policies   10. Policies which prevent availability of low cost access devices, do not create incentives for further investment, and add direct cost to providing and purchasing broadband services (Chapter 5)    * Creation of content and applications   11. The lack of locally relevant content and applications, especially for broadband, which is caused primarily by a lack of users and the absence of a "changeengine" to drive the growth (Chapter 6)    We have addressed these hurdles with twelve sets of recommendations for creating an environment that is more conducive to attracting investors, entrepreneurs and consumers to contribute to the spread of these services. These recommendations include:    * Definition and goals   1. Broadband is an "An always-on data connection that is able to support various interactive services, and has the capability of a minimum download speed of 256 Kbps." This will be revised upwards in the future (Section 2.1)    2. India can achieve 20 million broadband and 40 million internet subscribers by 2010, which translate to penetration levels of 1.7% and 3.4%, respectively. This is a bare minimum target and will need to be upgraded as progress is made (Section 2.2)    * Access to the customer in the last mile   3. Enabling the use of the existing infrastructure on the incumbents' copper to reach customers via DSL (Section 3.4.2)   4. Decreasing artificial costs in the operation of DTH and VSAT platforms, while allowing broadband services to be offered via these technologies (Section 3.6)   5. Allowing terrestrial wireless solutions to spread more effectively as a means to reach customers with today's technologies, as well as those in the near future (Section 3.7)  6. Enabling right of way clearance systems to be further streamlined for both current and future build-out efforts (Section 3.9)    * Costs of backhaul networks   7. Allowing customers to realize the benefits of competition in domestic leased lines while compensating for the current lack of such competition in "within city" links (Section 4.1.5)   8. Identifying the steps that need to be taken to make NIXI effective and attractive for ISP's of all sizes to willingly partic ipate (Section 4.2)    * Fiscal policies   9. Encouraging the availability of low cost access devices through depreciation, donation and recycling of used PC's (Section 5.3)   10. Decreasing to the level of duties on mobile phones the current overall levels of duties for imported items used in broadband networks, and equalizing duties Growth of Internet and Broadband on inputs and domestically manufactured goods with those that are imported (Section 5.4)   11. Providing the appropriate tax structure to enable faster growth, without the Government having to forego significant revenue (Section 5.5)    * Creation of content and applications   12. Outlining how the Government should proceed in being more aggressive in its efforts to create content and applications available online for interacting with citizens, and thereby serve as a leading example (Chapter 6) Once these recommendations are implemented, India can reach broadband penetration levels that are 50 times where we are today within a couple of years. The growth that has been witnessed in a few years in India in the telephony space and in Korea in broadband, can be replicated and surpassed.  ****  urlLink Download the Full Report in *PDF*  (Righ Click on the link and Choose 'Save Target As')****   Related Links :  *  urlLink Consumer Broadband Report for 2004 [PDF]  prepared by  urlLink Nagendra Technology Consulting    *  urlLink Reliance kickstarts broadband operations with TV channels    *  urlLink Birds-Eye.Net India Broadband Operator Directory   *  urlLink CIOL : News : India poised for the broadband leap

       Weakness in Indian Intellectual Property (IP) Laws  Even after the improvements in the IPR laws, protection of  IP  in some areas remains weak due to inadequate laws and ineffective enforcement, says a  urlLink Special 302 Report  released by  urlLink United States Trade Representative  (USTR) B Zoellick. Some of the problems areas in IP Laws are in Software IP Laws, WIPO Internet treaties implementation, Trademarks & Copyright infringements. USTR has kept India on  urlLink Priority Watch LIst   and this is what the report stays about India :   While India has improved its IPR regime, protection of intellectual property in some areas remains weak due to inadequate laws and ineffective enforcement. India's  urlLink 2002 patent law amendments  (which became effective in May 2003) exempt subject matter such as biotechnological inventions, methods for agriculture and horticulture, processes for the treatment of humans, animals, or plants, and substances prepared by chemical processes from patent protection. Under the  urlLink TRIPS Agreement , India has until January 1, 2005 to provide product patent protection, including for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. While the United States is encouraged by the Indian Government's recent statements concerning implementation of data exclusivity regulations, India has yet to implement the TRIPS obligation to protect confidential test data submitted by innovative pharmaceutical companies for market approval. India's Copyright Act has three overly broad exceptions, which together weaken protection of software. India is also in the process of revising its copyright law to implement the  urlLink WIPO Internet treaties ; we expect India to fully implement its obligations in this regard. Protection of foreign trademarks remains difficult due to procedural barriers and delays. Trademark owners must prove they have used their mark to avoid a counterclaim for registration cancellation due to non-use. Such proof can be difficult, given India's policy of discouraging foreign trademark use. Companies denied the right to import and sell products in India often are unable to demonstrate use of registered trademarks through local sale.    Piracy of copyrighted materials (particularly software, films, popular fiction and certain textbooks) remains a problem for U.S. and Indian rightholders. India has not adopted an optical disc law to deal with optical media piracy. Cable television piracy continues to be a significant problem, with estimates of tens of thousands of illegal systems in operation. The United States also has serious concerns about high levels of counterfeiting, particularly for medicines and auto parts. India's criminal IPR enforcement regime remains weak, and India needs sustained, centralized, coordinated enforcement of intellectual property rights, especially trademarks and copyrights. Its court system is extremely slow, and there are only a few reported convictions for copyright infringements resulting from raids. Industry reports significant weaknesses in India's border protection against counterfeit and pirated goods. India also needs to address the high volume of exports of domestically produced counterfeit goods.

       Hiware Bazaar : Going green at the grassroots - and blossoming   Where there is will, theirs a way. Yesterday via  CNBC came through this interesting story about Hiware Bazaar, a small village in Maharashtra which is like a Oasis in Dought Ridden Maharashtra. The Sarpanch and the Panchayat have a ambitious plan for 2005 that , nobody in the village should be below the poverty line and without a piece of land. They also ensure that villagers have access to loans and ensure that loan is used effeciently for the right purpose. Hiware bazaar has some wonderful water reservation plans like banning of certain crops, banning on digging borewells and the beauty is that villagers and farmers do understand this restrictions and now also witness & party  to the benefits. By this example we can say that "the probelm is not that people don't have the solutions, the problem is that people don't get the problems right ?." Once you get the problem right you have easy solutions and big results.     The achievements of Hiware Bazaar and others are highlighted in the  urlLink  Planning Commission of India  report :  urlLink WATER The Water Women: A Case Study of Tank Restoration . [ The report is in PDF : To download , Right click the link and choose "Save Target As".]    Adarsh Gaon   In 1993, three years after a serious village led community development process was underway, Hiware Bazaar was recognized by the Government of Maharashtra as an &lsquo;Adarsh Gaon&rsquo; (ideal village). Under a government program that sought to identify the most promising locations of village development in each district, the Hiware Bazaar story was highlighted to the government machinery and to the people at large. In many ways this was because it quickly learnt from the experiences of village development from itsmore famous neighbor of the last decade, Ralegao Siddhi.. By adopting the four tenets of Anna Hazare's work, Charabandhi (ban on grazing), Nashabandhi (ban on alcohol) Nassbandhi (family planning) and Katbandhi (ban on deforestation), it appealed to planners and politicians alike.    The results of this recognition, besides having monetary benefits for various developments were enormous. Access to government and bureaucratic machinery was greatly increased as a consequence of this. As a result, villageleaders now report few difficulties while trying to access the bureaucratic structure of the government. Most officials were extremely cooperative and eager to enhance the successes of their efforts.    Over the years, therefore, the village of Hiware Bazaar has reportedly used the infrastructure and benefit of many government and quasi government agencies for village development works. These are:   1. Yashwant Krishi Panlot Sanstha- NGO headed by the sarpanch, (recipient of Adarsh Gav Yojna) funded nalla bunding, aforestations, storage bandharas, and boulder/ earthen structures  2. Forest Department- Van-tale, aforestation  3. Agriculture department- Bunding  4. Minor Irrigation dept- Percolation tanks  5. Rural Sanitation programme- Construction of toilets  6. ?- Subsidies for Biogas, solar energy  7. MH Govt.&#8211; watershed training institute  8. ICAR and Mahatma Phule Agricultural University- increasing dry crop yields under Jawahar research scheme  Related Links :   *  urlLink Going green at the grassroots - and blossoming

       Telecom Infrastructure sharing between SAARC countries  A PIB  urlLink Report  :   India has called for the need to optimise the use of telecom infrastructure for intra-regional communication with a view to bring down the costs of telecom services. This was stated by the Union Minister of Communication and Information Technology Shri Dayanidhi Maran, while addressing the 2nd SAARC Communication Ministers Conference at Islamabad, Pakistan today. Shri Maran said that &#8220;Using each others infrastructure for intra-regional communication can prove to be economically advantageous, but with the added benefit of the resources circulating within the region, besides lower tariffs to the consumer&#8221;. For more effective regional co-operation , Sh Maran stated that it would also be necessary to digitalise inter-country links within the region in a time bound manner. &#8220;On our part, we have digitalised all our telephone exchanges&#8221; he added.

       When is the right time to start your own business?   urlLink Mahesh Murthy  gives some pointers on  urlLink When is the right time to start your own business? . In the given extract he talks about "Education" .   Education seems to make no difference whatsoever to your likelihood of success as an entrepreneur. As an employee maybe, but not as a business owner. (A personal observation: I never bothered getting a degree, and I don't think it's hurt me very much so far.)     The bigger point, though, is what will make the business you intend to start successful. Again, I really believe the key to succeeding is to understand the market you will be operating in. See what the buyers need and what current sellers offer - and figure out if there's a gap where you can offer something better, and in a way that others can't match soon enough.     This is what it takes. To do this requires no particular education - and no set years of experience. If there are so many successful Internet entrepreneurs around the world barely out of their teens, it's because they had the relevant experience of being online early in life - and they figured out the problems and a solution for their markets better than anybody else twice their age. They may be young - but they had the relevant experience.     That's why you rarely see teenaged chemical industry successes, or 20-year-old biotech billionaires. You need the 'right' experience and insights from it - not just years of work at some unconnected place.     That hopefully answers the other question many of you put to me - "Mahesh, I'm joining a bank and want to work for a few years, and then start an organic vegetable operation". Sorry, bossman, no can do. That is not relevant to your intended line of business. You're better off going to the mandi now.

       Technology as a Threat to Job   urlLink Harvey Cohen , president of  urlLink Strategy Analytics  believes that  urlLink Technology is the biggest threat to jobs .Technology that adds intelligence to computers poses a far more serious threat to jobs than low-wage countries. According to him, "The thing about technology is that it has a tendency to creep up on you".  Computers also handle many customer-service tasks today, such as directing callers to service reps or scanning customers' email and giving back automated responses. As computer intelligence improves, technology will handle more tasks and replace more people.     And the technology will get better. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the research arm for the US military, is leading a project to develop a vehicle that can navigate a desert for at least 15 kilometres without a driver. Prototypes have gone as far as 11km, successfully moving around cactuses, boulders and other obstacles.     "I view this in the same way as the first flight of the Wright brothers," Cohen said.     Such advancements eventually find their way into businesses, which means someday fewer jobs driving forklifts and delivery trucks.     "The level of embedded intelligence in our electronic products and services is at a real turning point where we see this accelerating," Cohen said.

       A victim raped twice : Morons for the protection of Human Rights of a Rapist:   My response to Amit's blog entry :  urlLink Dhananjay's punishment got a Stay order . Mr. President is considering his mercy plea. But Why ?    Amit, I completely agree with you in some cases i think capital punishment must be there. If somebody kills another human, he/she by default looses the right to live. And all those preachers of human rights, can they take the responsibility to change that person, or commit that the same person will not do the same crime again.   Everybody comes up with Solutions in India, but all of them have not understood the problem right.  The people who cannot get the work done from their local municipality , hue and cry about the human rights, It makes me bang my head on the wall.   First think about the human right about the child labour working in your house, that minor girl who is available in Rs.150 in the read light area of your city. And most importantly think about the human rights of that victim who got raped and about the human rights of the family who has suffered a lost.   Please use "Reference to Context", for god sakes don't debate about the f***** human rights of a rapist. Don't talk about this bullshit of humans and civilization. Do you think carrying mobiles , flying spaceships, and connecting on the internet makes us civilized. Animals are the first class species on this earth who beautify this planet, humans are the worst thing on the planet. If you don't believe me, just close your eyes and see this planet without humans, i will call that vision as a very ideal and good dream.  Dudes.... open your eyes and see others and yourself how human we are and how civilized we are. For Human rights must apply to humans, and they do not exist in ideal form anywhere on this planet. As science says "Survival of the fittest", the people who are not fit in terms of capabilities in harming others, need a protection of capital punishment.

Background on Ashden Awards:  The Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy were created in 2001 by the Ashden Trust, one of the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts. For the first two years, the awards were presented in association with the Whitley Awards for Conservation. The success of the renewable energy awards encouraged the Ashden Trust to set up an independent scheme and to increase the number of awards, thanks to contributions from four other Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts.   Due to their success, the awards have expanded in number and geographical coverage. This is the second year to include projects in the UK, recognising that industrialised countries need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   The Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy 2003 are presented in association with Green Futures, the UK's leading magazine on environmental solutions and sustainable futures, and its parent organisation, Forum for the Future. Forum for the Future was founded in 1996 by three of the UK's leading advocates of sustainable development - Jonathon Porritt, Sara Parkin and Paul Ekins. The charity aims to accelerate the building of a sustainable way of life, taking a positive, solutions-oriented approach.   *  urlLink Ashden Awards International Finalists 2004   *  urlLink Picture Gallery of Finalist

       A letter to Western Media Representatives  (Appologies for typos, spelling and grammatical mistakes - forgot to include in original email) Dear Mr. Morales,    I was kind of disturbed by seeing your news article published in Bloomberg today : India Kills 5 Kashmir Rebels; 23 People Hurt in Blast, AFP Says . (http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&sid=audL0YUGBIL8&refer=asia)    It seems that either I am ingorant about politics and my country or the western media doesn't have the willigness or honesty to understand the difference between "Rebel", "Terrorist" or "Militant". I am in no support and bias towards India and Pakistant , I am hopless about both their politics and politicians.    I know you don't represent the entire western media but atleast I can know your personal thoughts on this and your reply may also eliminate certain misconceptions in my mind (if any) and I would get my facts straight.    I would like to ask you on the behalf of a common Indian Citizens, relatives of the people who died in Kashmir & rest of India and families of martyr soldiers . I will be very obliged to know what makes you say these peoples "Islamic Rebels", is India - Pakistan issue a Hindu - Muslim issue, I think by attaching this tag of "Islamic (Rebels) you are hurting Muslims in India also. Please let us know why don't you use the term "Terrorits" .    If according to you the definition of "Rebel" is correct then, do rebels kill people in another states and innocent common citizens who are in no-way attached to Kashmir issue ? . For Example : Mumbai Bomb Blast and Gujarat Temple Attack.    Also if they are truly rebels then why are Indian Politicians remain untouched and the body count of innocent people increases day-by-day. Who are they rebelling against normal people of India (for your information Hindus & Muslims both) or Goverment of India.    Again, I would be very obliged to get the reply from you, or if you think I am a Hindu fundamentalist and a "Rebel" then please do understand that I do not kill people and I know that your mail software has a "Delete" button.    Thanks & Regards, Santoshkumar http://sanspeak.blogspot.com    cc : Editor responsible for this story: Peter Torday at  ptorday@bloomberg.net.

       Trai Releases Consultation Paper On Access Deficit Review   urlLink TRAI Releases Consultation Paper on Review of Access Deficit Charges  :   TRAI had notified an Interconnection Usage Charge (IUC) and an Access Deficit Charge (ADC) regime in January, 2003 which was subsequently reviewed and a revised scheme for IUC and ADC was notified on 29th October, 2003.  The Authority had stated in its subsequent notification, inter alia, that it would be reviewing the ADC regime annually, it would consider phasing out ADC funding to BSOs other than BSNL after next review, and consider moving to a revenue share regime to fund the ADC, which should gradually decline and be phased out within three to five years.  The Authority has released a Consultation Paper today to begin the consultation process for such a review.     The paper first recalls some of the key points that the Authority had made in its notification of 29th October, 2003  regarding the evolution of the ADC regime over time, and its review for adopting a revised regime based on revenue share.  The paper then notes a number of difficulties that have been reported regarding reconciliation of data (and hence related payments) as well as certain incentives for call bypass/grey market calls under the present ADC regime.  The Authority has reached a conclusion that these matters would be suitably addressed under a regime based on revenue share.  In this context, the Authority has also raised the issue of the ADC being made available only to BSNL, the incumbent which has a large presence in the country, including in rural and remote areas.      The paper argues that if the ADC regime is based on revenue share, then the extent of data requirement for the review is much lower than that required for an ADC regime based on varying charges per minute.  Thus, based on reasonable assumptions on growth of subscriber base for fixed and mobile, capital investment and average revenues per user (including revenues from access and long distance services), it would be possible to calculate the required percentage revenue share that would fund the ADC.  The paper has taken a range for the average monthly rental for BSNL&rsquo;s fixed service, and thus has reached a range for the proposed ADC revenue share.  One estimate of monthly rental is Rs. 156, which was the amount, based on actual data for 2002-2003, considered for the IUC Regulation of 29th October 2003.  Subsequent to this some revisions in the monthly rentals have taken place in a number of tariff schemes, as a result of which the average monthly rental would have increased.  An upper limit of Rs. 200 has been taken for monthly rental, in the paper on ADC review.  This amount was used in the first IUC Regulation which was notified on 24th January, 2003, based on the standard tariff packages in place.  Further, the Authority has now given tariff forbearance (except for rural areas).  Thus, the range for monthly rental considered for the ADC review is Rs. 156 to Rs. 200.       The range for the proposed ADC revenue share based on the calculations mentioned in the paper is 2.2% (for monthly rental of Rs. 200) and 5.3% (for monthly rental of Rs. 156) of AGR(Adjusted Gross Revenue).      The Authority invites responses from the stakeholders by 15th July, 2004.  For more detail, please see the TRAI website at &#8220;www.trai.gov.in&#8221;.

       We don't need Satyendra Dubey  Ranjeev C Dubey, managing partner of New Delhi Law Offices (South) writes in  urlLink Business World India  ; Why India doesn't need a Whistle Blower Act. To some extent he is correct, but what he expects "effective, responsible government" requires"effective, responsible society". The society is getting what its deserves but the penalty is paid by people like Satyendra Dubey. So the best solution will be to not to have people like Satyendra Dubey.  Support corruption, save a life .  Corporate India does have legitimate fears: for one, cohesion, mutual faith and team play are the key to productivity, and institutionalised Orwellian squealing is its antithesis. Second, there are a thousand ways to victimise squealing employees, but such laws only encourage the incompetent to become whistle-blowers to avoid being sacked. Third, whistle-blowing settles extraneous scores, promotes 'political' subgroups, institutionalises internal and external blackmail, and adds to the predatory powers of our predatory state. Lastly, whistle-blowing results in defensive management, proliferates mindless procedures, and ultimately destroys initiative and risk-taking.     The key point here is that what applies to corporate India also applies to the government of India: a whistleblower law may only work to paralyse whatever still functions in the government. Let's face it, the whole corruption racket works on mutual benefits and fair distribution. What you probably will have with a whistle-blower law is a little benefit and a lot of problems.     So why do we need whistle-blower legislation? Laws don't automatically mean law-abiding societies. That apart, what will the law say that is not already covered under existing fair labour practice legislation ('thou shall not victimise') or, as in Dubey's case, the Indian Penal Code ('thou shall not kill')? So let me put it bluntly: to save a life such as Dubey's all you really need is appropriate and sensitive government response to credible information of corruption in high places, and an effective witness protection programme. These are administrative issues, not legislative ones.    This is not an argument for a whistle-blower law. This is only an argument for effective, responsible government. So let us focus on working towards responsible liberal governance and forget about the symbolism inherent in enacting a grand law we cannot and will not implement.

       Can Linux improve the lives of millions of people too poor to own a computer?  From  urlLink LinuxJournal  & also a discussion on  urlLink Slashdot :    urlLink Delixus, Inc . recently completed work on the Delixus e-Governance Platform 2004 edition that leverages the strengths of Linux to provide improved services to widows, pensioners and poor farmers in the Indian state of Karnataka. The Delixus e-Governance Platform addresses the needs of millions of rural poor citizens in India who receive widow or pension checks through services provided by local government offices. For several reasons, the current manual system is slow in getting checks to the people who desperately need the money. First, long distances often exist between the pension offices and the villages where people live. Second, cross-referencing multiple files for a single citizen often takes weeks due to the large volume of applicants. Third, citizens often are unaware when checks are ready for pickup.

       The Digital Village : Business Week   Manjeet Kripalani in BusinessWeek writes about the " urlLink The Digital Village  "; how the poor farmers of Karnataka are facing the benefits of digitization of the land records with equal access to information and proving as digital turning point for India. There is a great divide in India of haves and haves not, sometimes natural and sometimes artificial due to red-tapisim and exploitation. The equal access to information is a crucial right of any citizen and should not depend upon class, caste or status, thats what is the definition of Democracy. Technology can not only breat this divide and inquality or exploitation of system , but it also provides the power to the common man, the power of knowledge.   Stretching Resources    Many of these efforts are driven by the urge to profit: If a fraction of India's poor logged in or dialed up just once a day -- and paid a minuscule fee to a service provider for the privilege -- then the sheer mass could create a viable business. "If you can conceptualize the world's 4 billion poor as a market, rather than as a burden, they must be considered the biggest source of growth left in the world," says C.K. Prahalad, a leading management theorist who studies developing markets. Other pioneers are purely altruistic -- they want to break India's millennia-long curse of poverty.    It's an awesome curse, and at first look, it's hard to see how digital technology cooked up by some entrepreneurial do-gooders can relieve hunger or thirst or guarantee a better crop. No laptop, however cheap or durable, can compensate for India's lack of a nationwide power grid, or a comprehensive network of highways. But digital technology can deliver information -- information the rural poor desperately need -- about crop conditions, fertilizer prices, health care, and more. Reliable information can help India's poor stretch their resources -- to plant the right crops, deal with bureaucrats more effectively, operate on a level playing field with customers and merchants. The digital revolution in India is largely an information revolution..........

       View on Indian Reforms  Barry Shlachter from Star-Telegram writes : urlLink Reforms set the stage for India's boom    As Americans learn every day, bits and pieces of their economy are being dismantled and shipped overseas. India gets the lion's share of business-process outsourcing -- 35 percent -- compared with China's 15 percent, and 6 percent each for Canada and Mexico. At last count, more than 700,000 Indians work in outsourcing activities.    A remarkable convergence of factors has put India in the right place at the right time to become the world's white-collar outsourcing leader: an abundance of cheap but educated labor that speaks English and access to cutting-edge telecommunications technology that links U.S. clients or consumers with Indian facilities as if they were next door.    Help lines for utilities, credit cards, computer makers and others are now staffed in Bangalore, which controls 35 percent to 40 percent of the country's export software and business-services work, as well as in other southern Indian cities, including Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata and New Delhi. Telemarketing, financial research, tax returns, book editing, medical transcription, mortgage processing and payroll chores are increasingly being outsourced. Software design and programming is even bigger.    While offshoring work makes up a minuscule slice of India's economy, it was expected to bring in revenues of $12.2 billion in India for the year ending in June. That's up 28 percent over the previous 12 months, according to India's National Association of Software and Services Companies, the outsourcers' industry group. About a third was earned by call centers and business-process operations, the rest by software developers and programmers.    It's not all one-way traffic.    Many of the computers used by Indian call centers and software design offices are American-branded.    "Dell, Dell, Dell," rattles off V.S. Srinivasan, a Mumbai-based business-processing consultant to Mastek, which has forged a joint venture with Carreker, a Farmers Branch firm that specializes in outsourcing for financial institutions. "Compaq, Compaq, Compaq."    In April, IBM signed a 10-year agreement to handle all information technology for India's largest cellphone company, Bharti Televentures, a deal that Big Blue estimated would be worth at least $700 million. The same month IBM paid $160 million for a major Indian call center called Daksh.    And many of the Indian outsourcing providers have opened offices in the United States, hiring executives and sales staff.

       ISP's concentrate on VAS  Earlier other than PSTN Dial-up  & ISDN there were very few value addition with ISP like Leased Line,  Hosting, Co-locating server, etc. But now with VSNL's demonopolization and increase in service spectrum and increase in the knowledge of corporate sector, ISPs  are looking forward to gamut of Value Added Services like VOIP, DSL, Bandiwidth on Deman, VPN, Managed Services, Vide & Web Conferencing, Net Telephony, and lots of other mix-n-match of services. This  urlLink Express Computer  article discusses the slag faced by ISP idustry in general due to the dial-up dependancy of the customer, there is need for new technologies and new exitement. For example, I don't have boradband connection at home and may not in the near future also because in our area there are too many cybercafes and it should be profitable for my cable provider / internet provide to provide the connection in my area and/or building complex, but thanks to Reliance India Mobile I can now connect anywhere through my laptop or desktop.     urlLink  Express Computer Online : The growth of the Internet subscriber base in India has slowed down, it was less than five percent during Q3 and Q4 of 2003. According to the Internet Service Providers Asso-ciation of India (ISPAI), this is because close to 95 percent of Indian customers are still on dial-up which is unreliable in terms of speed and quality of service. Worse, a dial-up user gets hit with hefty phone bills on top of what he pays the ISP.     ISPAI points out that ISPs are focusing on metros and select B-class cities. This leaves small towns where customers cannot afford the high cost of buying a PC, an Internet connection and paying the telephone charges for &lsquo;net access. These users prefer to go the nearest cybercafe; hence the scope for increasing the dial-up subscriber base is very low. ISPs are therefore forced to look at VAS to make up for the loss they are incurring from pure dial-up services. Says Amitabh Singhal, president, ISPAI, &#8220;Out of the 4.1 million Internet subscribers in India, a majority reside in cities. That number can go up to 40 million if we offer value-added services such as broadband.&#8221;     ISPAI believes that Indian ISPs have plumped for the VAS route in order to be profitable with a low subscriber base. One obvious route is to sell services that increase bandwidth consumption and thereby the ISP&rsquo;s revenues. Notes Singhal, &#8220;In the last couple of years, many Indian ISPs have shuttered their establishments due to the slow growth of their subscriber base. ISPs will have to offer broadband and value-added services to remain in business.&#8221;

       Rediffmail goes 1 GB  After the launch of Gmail (google's email service) Yahoo! declared a 100 MB mail services but our very own Rediffmail dares to declare 1GB. Actually I was expecting the same from these email providers from long time since storages technologies have evolved and price/mb has dropped significantly, moreover the better management of space and deactivation of non-active members would have allowed yahoo & hotmail to provides space  n x 10 MB long time ago. But there was no need, since there was no competition so nobody even thoought of providing . Now with google's announcement the need has arrived to sustain the customers. But from 5 MB to 1 GB jump is amazing. I hope people will not misuse this for 'xxx' attachments ;-).   urlLink BusinessWire : Rediff.com India Limited (Nasdaq:REDF), one of the premier worldwide online providers of news, information, communication, entertainment and shopping services today announced the launch of Rediffmail 1GB effective 2000 hours IST today, giving virtually unlimited storage space of 1 gigabyte to all its free email users in India and worldwide.     With immediate effect, Rediffmail users will also be able to send in a single email a message of size up to 10 megabytes.     Earlier this year, Rediff.com had launched Rediffmail with enhanced security and feature-rich add-ons. Rediffmail users already enjoy a simple-to-use, fast and secured experience. Rediffmail is secured with an exclusive Spam Shield and enables one to write emails in 11 Indian languages.     Rediff.com will also start freeing up over 15 million email addresses that have not been in use over the years, giving new users a better chance of finding an email id of their choice. For the premium paid users, Rediffmail Plus and Rediffmail Mobile, the storage space available will be 2GB each. The storage previously available with Rediffmail was 5 MB and the mail message size 1 MB. For the paid Rediffmail Plus and Rediffmail Mobile users, storage was 10 MB and the mail message size 5 MB.

       A lesson on "KISS"  One of the most memorable case studies on Japanese management was the case of the empty soap box, which happened in one of Japan's biggest cosmetics companies. The company received a complaint that a consumer had bought a soap box that was empty. Immediately the authorities isolated the problem to the assembly line, which transported all the packaged boxes of soap to the delivery department. For some reason, one soap box went through the assembly line empty. Management asked its engineers to solve the problem.  Post-haste,   the engineers worked hard to devise an X-ray machine with high-resolution monitors manned by two people to watch all the soap boxes that passed through the line to make sure they were not empty. No doubt, they   worked hard and they worked fast but they spent whoopee amount to do so. But when a rank-and-file employee in a small company   was posed with the same problem, did not get into complications of   X-rays, etc but instead came out with another solution. He bought a strong   industrial electric fan and pointed it at the assembly line. He switched   the fan on, and as each soap box passed the fan, it simply blew the empty   boxes out of the line.   Moral of the story: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) i.e.alwayslook for simple solutions. Devise the simplest possible   solution that solves the problem :-)

       3G CDMA 2000 expands in India  Reliance Infocomm and Tata Teleservices are the driving factors of telecom growth in India especially in CDMA network implementations.

       High Skilled Job Outsourcing Fumes  Steve Lohr (New York Times)  urlLink writes :  [Higher-skilled jobs not safe from outsourcing]   Although definitions vary, software architects are highly skilled workers who often earn six-figure salaries in the United States. The Microsoft contracts with Infosys and Satyam show that the work of software architects, senior software developers and software developers was being done by employees of the Indian companies working at U.S. Microsoft facilities.    A spokeswoman for Infosys said the company does not comment on its contracts. A Satyam spokesman could not be reached.    Critics of the outsourcing trend regard such agreements with Indian contractors, with work done both in the United States and in India, as a step toward shifting more and more skilled technology jobs overseas.

ISPAI originally started activities in 1994, when e-mail licensees such as Sprint RPG Ltd., Global Telecom Services Ltd., Wipro Ltd., Datapro Information Technology Ltd., Crompton Greaves Ltd., Satyam Infoway Ltd., etc came together with the express purpose of initiating continuous dialogues with the Department of Telecommunications and seeking to remedy various shortcomings in the License Conditions, impress upon the Licensor to review, change and add new guidelines, and last but not the least exercise the right to obtain timely and quality infrastructure and resources to enable High Quality Services to be delivered by the licensees / operators.      With the formal announcement of Internet privatization during the later part of 1997, EISPAI had taken a lead role in monitoring the privatization process. During December 1997, the first draft guidelines from Department of Telecommunications (DoT) were posted on the Internet without the provision of a Single 'All India' License. After aggressive representation by EISPAI, Category &lsquo;A&rsquo; License for all India services was introduced in the draft license. We have since then been at the forefront of bringing about changes in the Internet Policy, through regular interaction with various Government Departments, other Industry Associations and Media.      ISPAI works closely with DoT, DIT, TRAI and Industry Associations such as FICCI, CII, Assocham etc. and it is our constant endeavor to take up and resolve various issues that affect implementation of the ISP's projects. ISPAI played a vital role in privatization of International Gateways within the laid down security constraints. Thus, ISPAI seeks opportunities to encourage and promote the use of Internet and IT enabled services, such as E-commerce, E-governance, Health Care and Distance Learning etc.    Related Links :  *  urlLink Department of Telecommunications - India   *  urlLink Ministry of Communications & Information Technology   *  urlLink The Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI)

       Towards Cost Effective Internet in India : GIPI's recommendations  From  urlLink CIOL  :  Global Internet Policy Initiative (GIPI ) executive director, George Sadowsky has called upon India to make Internet access affordable for the common man and improve the quality of service, if it wants to increase Internet penetration in the country. Sadowsky was speaking at a seminar on global Internet policy organized recently in Delhi.     GIPI has submitted its set of suggestions to the Government of India. The suggestions include setting up of Internet Exchange to route domestic traffic within the country. "Government can promote the use of Internet by saving international bandwidth and lowering of tariff for calls made to access Internet. Wireless Internet is one thing, which has picked up in rest of the world and it should be properly encouraged in India too. All this should be done to compliment the development of local content. Tax benefits for hardware can also promote the use of IT and Internet as a whole," Sadowsky said.    What is GIPI :  The Global Internet Policy Initiative supports adoption of the legal and policy framework for an open and democratic Internet. The project works with local stakeholders in consultative, coalition-based efforts to promote the principles of a decentralized, accessible, user-controlled, and market-driven Internet.

       Challenges faced by indian outsourcing industry  From  urlLink SpaceDaily :  "Every year, about 70,000 jobs are added and the main challenge is how to attract people," he told delegates at a conference held by NASSCOM, India's leading information technology body, in the southern city of Bangalore.    "The challenge is also how to retain the pool. It's a collective challenge. We require a holistic approach to expand the pool and train people. The question here is how to retain the manpower to deliver quality and value."     Analysts say outsourcing labour attrition rates vary between 20 and 40 percent in some companies while at top firms it averages at least 15 percent.    The National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) said in a recent report the outsourcing industry was expected to face a shortage of 262,000 professionals by 2012.

       is india ready for wi-fi  R.K.Choudhary writes in Wi-Fi Technology [ urlLink Wi-Fi Technology in Indian homes, is India ready!]  :    Wi-Fi @ Indian home has different Scenario. Unwiring Indian home doesn&rsquo;t look so simple in compare to Western countries. There are some definite issues considered as far as the Indian home is concerned, like Broadband availability, Low PC penetration, Security, Perceived cost, Low education levels and Vendor indifference. Another major hurdle seems to be civil construction of the Indian home. The average Indian house is made of concrete and in most cases is restricted to one story in comparison to western countries, which are made of wood and stretches up to at least two floors.    But besides the above highlighted darker sides of Wi-Fi @ Indian home, we should not ignore the fact that India is the second most populous country in the world. India is shining, and its middle class is becoming more and more IT savvy. Whereas the Wi-Fi market worldwide is growing at an exponential rate, this rate would not be applicable in the Indian Wi-Fi market. However, after all, there should soon be a notable increase in its Wi-Fi market due to its size.   Related Links :   *  urlLink Star India launches wireless division

       India Shining is  currently under re-construction  Andy Mukherjee,  columnist for Bloomberg News  urlLink writes  about the "India Shining" campaign which is currently under re-construction ;-). He points out that there is no shortage of Slogans in India be it BJP or Congress and disucsses the real issues which nobody seems to be bothered about.  The high-decibel ``India Shining'' publicity blitzkrieg has come to a quiet, unceremonious end.     Type www.indiashining.com in your browser's address box now, and the message pops up: ``This Web site is currently under reconstruction.''     Wasn't it just three months ago that the government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was using the $11 million campaign to ``spread the enthusiasm'' of ``these excellent times''?     One election changed everything.     Now that Vajpayee has been voted out, gone with him are the Internet images of beaming villagers and happy mothers. In public consciousness, they've been supplanted by new metaphors, which tell us how the new government will bring good cheer to every citizen before its five-year term is out.     Thankfully, there's no Web site, or television promos, to peddle the new dream of ``economic reforms with a human face.'' At least, not yet.     The government of Manmohan Singh, the new prime minister, will pursue economic policies that will benefit the common man to ``achieve the goal of making a billion people smile,'' India's President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam told lawmakers this week.     Investors must recognize that these too are slogans, and rather trite ones at that. The Congress party, back in power after eight years, has borrowed the idea of a billion smiling faces from nationalist leader Mohandas Gandhi, the Mahatma, who wanted to ``wipe every tear from every eye.''

       Cybercops to monitor the chat rooms  From  urlLink Gaurdian  :   British "cybercops" are to join other law enforcers around the world which are patrolling internet chatrooms to try to protect children from paedophiles.    Assistant chief constable Jim Gamble, of the national crime squad, said the move was one of several measures to clamp down on adults using computers to view child pornography and "groom" children in order to abuse them. The Virtual Global Taskforce, which includes the NCS, the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Australian Federal Police, and Interpol, will nominate officers to monitor the net round the clock.

       Outsourcing is not a threat   urlLink Raghuram G Rajan ,  economic counsellor and director of the  urlLink IMF  Research Department and  urlLink Shang-Jin Wei  , head of the research department's Trade Unit write in Business Times Asia  [ urlLink The non-threat that is outsourcing  ] : According to the article every decade or so, developed countries develop a crisis of confidence that also along the lines of Election Years. For example in 1980s, it was fear of Japan and now it is fear of India during the election times.  First, consider the amount of 'insourcing', that is, the value of business services exported by a country like the US. Clearly, this is considerable - think of all the high-priced business consultants and lawyers in rich countries offering their services to the rest of the world.     What is noteworthy, however, is that in each of the past 10 years, the value of US insourcing has been greater than that of US outsourcing! This is true even though the US has been running a trade deficit and an overall current account deficit.     Most other rich economies also run a surplus in these service categories. None of this should be surprising as the rich countries tend to do high-value-added service activities relatively better than the rest of the world. In fact, the US has the largest dollar surplus of insourcing over outsourcing in computer, information, and business services (at US$21 billion in 2001). The second-largest surplus country, by the way, is not India, but the UK.     Put another way, if every country decided to put up barriers against outsourcing, the output of developed countries would fall far more than that of developing countries.

       The Dirty little secrets of IT outsourcing By Nick Eian  Nick Eian , the CEO of  urlLink Endurant Business Solutions , a consulting company that helps businesses, executives and entrepreneurs with organizational and technology challenges writes in Startribune  [ urlLink Dirty little secret of IT outsourcing  ]  :  While U.S. companies believe they're outsourcing to save money by employing workers with lower hourly rates in other countries, they're really fooling themselves. Project costs will begin to soar when they try to fix the predictable problems that occur with developers abroad (some are calling this "onshoring"). All the global outsourcing accomplished was to delay the inevitable reconciling of bad management practices, which can range from obsolete work processes to poorly defined goals.    In some cases, U.S. companies think outsourcing means they can radically speed up the development process. They throw more lower-paid offshore developers at a problem in an effort to get the project finished faster. That's sort of like thinking that nine pregnant women can get together and produce a single baby in one month. Obviously "more" doesn't mean "faster" when there are well-defined developmental steps that must be followed to produce a healthy result.    Outsourcing should be the result of a strategic business decision, after careful analysis proves that it's the only way to cut costs or access crucial raw materials. Instead, the decision to outsource frequently is made by frustrated corporate executives who are looking for easy solutions to tough problems.

       What ? Microsoft Patents Double Clicks ???  Microsoft gains double-clicking patent and wanna play the GOD. I think patents should have some social clause attached to it. If man is a social animal then patents must have some boundaries and social consideration and its social impact.Double click is simply an extension to the idea of mouse which was invented XEROX Palo Alto Laboratary and first incorporate by Apple. Microsoft may not excercise its patent right very strictly but nobody can stop legally if they want to. Patenting is good for business in one way and thats why it exists but it should have jury based application which would think wholesome and would also consider the effect of the patent and its impact on society . Just imagine if there was a patent on "Wheel"?.  Microsoft has successfully patented using short, long or double clicks to launch different applications on "limited resource computing devices" - presumably PDAs and mobile phones. The US patent was granted on 27 April.    Now any US company using a variety of clicks to launch different software functions from the same button will have to change their product, pay licensing fees to Microsoft or give Microsoft access to its intellectual property in return.     British company Symbian, which makes operating systems for mobile phones that employ double clicks and has offices in the US could be affected, as could PalmOne in California, which supplies PDA software.    Several activists who oppose software patents say that Microsoft's patent is not a "sensible use" of the patenting system because the idea of the long, short and double clicks is neither novel or non-obvious.     Both the US and the UK use these criteria to decide whether or not to grant patents. "It is almost beyond parody that Microsoft has been able to do this," says Ian Brown of the Foundation for Information Policy Research in London, UK.

       Toxis Dust On Computer and its Effect on Health  Sci Tech News  urlLink Reports  :  Toxic dust found on computer processors and monitors contains chemicals linked to reproductive and neurological disorders, according to a new study by several environmental groups.    The survey, released by Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Computer TakeBack Campaign and Clean Production Action, is among the first to identify brominated flame retardants on the surfaces of common devices in homes and offices.    Electronics companies began using polybrominated diphenyl (PBDEs) and other flame retardants in the 1970s, arguing that the toxins prevent fires and cannot escape from plastic casings.    The study found that tiny particles of the toxic chemicals are leaching out, escaping into the air and attaching to ordinary dust on the computer equipment.    From Computer TakeBack Campaign :  Discarded personal computers and consumer electronics &#8211; so-called &#8220;e-waste&#8221; &#8211; compose one of the fastest growing and highly toxic waste streams in the industrialized world. There will soon be an estimated 300 million to 600 million obsolete computers in the U.S., with fewer than 10% recycled. Containing lead, mercury, cadmium, and dioxin-like flame retardants, obsolete computers pose a serious threat to human health and the environment when improperly disposed or recycled. Taxpayers and local governments bear the cost and burden of managing these wastes. The Computer TakeBack Campaign was formed in response to this growing crisis, promoting brand owner and producer responsibility for e-waste.   ATDSR TOX FAQ :  Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are manmade chemicals found in plastics used in a variety of consumer products to make them difficult to burn. Some people who ate food contaminated with PBBs in the 1970s had skin problems. Almost nothing is known about health effects of PBDEs in people. PBBs have been found in at least 9 of the 1,613 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). PBDEs have not been identified in any of the 1,613 sites.

Parents really need to vigil, internet is not like TV which can be kept "Always ON" without any monitoring. Even too much of TV is not good for mind and body both. Parents cannot just shrugg off their responsibility by blaming the media and the internet, personal sensorship is the best method to protect you and your family. And the most important step towards this is to become "aware" of what is happening with your TV and Computer and how it is being used.

It's emergent: You don't need to maintain explicit links to people in your network, it's mined from your address book    The user owns the data. No need to assign ownership of your friends to an aggregating monetizing marketing web site.   It answers a question that will become more and more vital as details of our life are increasingly digitized: how do you share these details without losing your privacy? It's not clear to me how many data types the Bloom Filters could be extended to, but as a proof-of-concept I think it's great.

       How Intel Is Spreading Out In India ?  Intel is funding futuristic research , trhough  the Tenet group at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai, which plans  to deliver  low cost connectivity and internet access to India&rsquo;s rural masses. Intel is funding the Tenet group&rsquo;s research in the digitisation of radio. Intel is in India from late 1990s but in the last 3 years it has show a great interest in Indian operations and trying every bit to enter into symbiotic relationship with India. Companies like HP & Texas instrument also taking lots of effort to build a mutually beneficial eco-system between them and India but Intel with the size and depth of it's initatives is surely taking the lead. There was also a speculation recently that Intel is planning to set up a $45 million chip manufacturing unit in Chennai, but it was  urlLink denied  by Intel.  A prime example of funding futuristic research at an academic institution is the Tenet group at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai, which is well on the way to delivering low cost connectivity and internet access to India&rsquo;s rural masses. Intel is funding the Tenet group&rsquo;s research in the digitisation of radio.     A fundamental shift is taking place in how radios are built. In the last four or five years, instead of using capacitors, resistors and inductors and building an analog radio, researchers are seeking to acquire the signal and immediately turn it into a digital signal and do everything in the digital domain through digital signal processing. That makes possible much smaller radios, which can be applied to many uses beyond the conventional.     IIT, Mumbai, in addition to having a VLSI design lab, is working on silicon emulation. Integrated chips, which are becoming more and more complicated, are all built as one piece of standard silicon.     urlLink Full Story  [Business Standard]

       Broadband & Internet Plans for India  The Communications and  urlLink Information Technology  Minister, Mr Dayanidhi Maran  urlLink plans  to  take steps to increase broadband and internet connectivity in India  at affordable prices. According to  urlLink TRAI  estimatation India can achieve 20 million broadband and 40 million internet subscribers by 2010 which would increase in penetration level of 1.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.  At present, India has 0.4 internet connections and 0.02 broadband connections per 100 persons, with its current level 50 per cent higher than what it was just six months ago.    Korea has achieved its success story in less than five years, going from less than one broadband subscriber per 100 persons in 1999 to the levels it has reached today. By 2002, nearly 30 per cent of their GDP was transacted on broadband. The lessons that India learns from these examples can be applied to India&rsquo;s current situation to realise the same explosive success.

       India's Dominance in Outsourcing  E.C. Thomas  urlLink writes  about - India's Dominance in the outsourcing industry. He also writes about the outsourcing competition and controversy surrounding it. The extract covers the growth of outsourcing in India:  The BPO sector in India has been growing at almost 60 to 70 per cent per annum. According to NASSCOM, the projected revenue of the BPO industry in India is expected to touch US $ 12 billion in 2006. This is a nearly four-fold growth from the 2003-04 revenue estimates of around US $ 3.6 billion.     The number of jobs increased from 140,000 at the end of March 2003 to a projected 245,000 in March 2004, according to Nasscom&rsquo;s &lsquo;Strategic Review 2004&rsquo;. This could rise almost five times in the next five years. Each day nearly 200 people join the Indian ITES &#8211; BPO industry.     BPO is a specialized form of international trade in services, based on the doctrine of comparative advantage in international trade. Today, companies outsource to destinations like India because they see value in their investments in terms of quality service and financial spending. By outsourcing to quality and lower cost operations, these companies are able to lower overhead costs, compress time-to-completion with efficient time difference management and focus on core competencies. There are many clear instances of such advantages to companies over a short time-frame. Likewise, banks and financial institutions will not send their data to these countries, unless they are sure of the credentials. As pointed out in the McKinsey Institute study, the US economy benefits in outsourcing in more ways than one.     One estimate says that the General Electric (GE) which employs 18,000 workers in India, saves $ 350 million per year through outsourcing. In all, $ 8 billion has been saved in the USA through outsourcing. A NASSCOM report estimated 60 per cent savings in costs for companies outsourcing to India. There exist 185 Fortune 500 companies which outsource work to India. Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) provides opportunities for MNCs to reap the surplus in the service sector that did not exist earlier. The companies engaged in production of value-added services, from medical transcriptions to software programming, require skilled labour which countries like India have in abundance. In fact, Indian call centres have a higher productivity as compared to those in the USA or UK.     According to NASSCOM, an Indian call centre agent makes on an average 98 correct transactions, as compared to 95 by an agent in the UK. Besides, the Indian makes 120 transactions an hour, while his British counterpart makes only 100. However, efficiency does not always mean higher pay. A worker&rsquo;s basic salary in the USA is $ 63,000 per annum, while it is $ 5,850 in India and $ 4,750 in China for the same job.

       Mahesh Murthy about Comfortability & Entrepreurship  Mahesh Murthy sites the Example of Google for Would Be Entrepreneurs in  urlLink Business World India . The original Google IPO Document can be locate  urlLink here :  Wall Street is sweating. Google has forsaken the traditional way of raising money - of going to investment bankers who would underprice the shares and sell it to favoured customers who would make a huge amount of money when trading opened. Google chose the Net and the Dutch auction process that gives the smallest investor the same right as the biggest ones. When one firm, Goldman Sachs, tried to schmooze its way to get the Google IPO mandate, it was summarily fired. This is a company that clearly says I'm not part of your system. And a company with the size and track record to actually change that system.   Thousands of entrepreneurs should watch this IPO closely. If it takes off - I truly hope it will - it can drive a stake through the heart of the 'old, big bank' way of doing things. It could not just make capital markets freer, more transparent, but also shine a light for other company founders to stand up, say what they believe in, and reject the path of PR gobbledygook.   I see entrepreneurs coming to me, in suits and ties they're not comfortable in, showing slides full of nonsense jargon. I asked one why he was dressed so. "Sir, all magazines show businessmen dressed this way." Here's hoping that the pretence and sham of 'formality' won't stop you in what you want to do.   If you're starting a business, you need to win the trust of people around you. If you dress and speak like someone you're not, they can see through you. If you prefer being in kurtas and speaking in Bhojpuri, do so. If you're a clown at heart, it's far better to be one, than become another statistic in this world full of clones.

       The (Un) Common Minimum Program  The Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the ruling coalition is being trumpeted as &lsquo;reform with a human face&rsquo; but looks suspiciously like  urlLink &lsquo;populism with a bankrupt face  The another impact will be on FDIs and there is a sure  reason to believe that India will see  urlLink muted flows  this year.  One big negative for capital is the government's decision not to disinvest public sector units (PSUs). Disinvestment was one of the main triggers for attracting foreign inflows last year.  Out of the FII flows that came into India in the past 15 months, over 40 per cent have gone into PSUs. These flows have caused PSUs to re-rate over 100 per cent in the past one year. Experts point that if there is disinvestment of large companies through the market route, foreign funds will be attracted.     SWAMINATHAN S ANKLESARIA AIYAR writes in Econmoic Times that The CMP claims it will reduce the revenue deficit to zero by &lsquo;09. But it has no credible programme to raise enough revenue to meet even the current deficit, let alone one greatly expanded by explosive spending on education, health and employment. The Full Story can be found in ' urlLink Public debt at 85% of GDP in '04'  In another article on Economic Times he points out that  urlLink CMP will lead to nation's bankruptcy   If seriously implemented, the CMP could swell the fiscal deficit from 10% of GDP to an astronomical 16-17% of GDP. Even one step in that direction will cause FIIs and domestic investors to flee, producing a stock market crash that makes the Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh debacles look like a picnic. Any JPC enquiry will easily identify the culprits behind such a crash: Manmohan Singh, Sitaram Yechury, and others who drafted the CMP.   The  urlLink highlights of the common minimum programme  can be found at Sify.com   Once again we are seeing a "Garibi Hatao" program from the Garib Banao Congress. There stupid policies and rules of license raaj has created the great divide in indian society and economy which they want to recreate through populist measures again. If there is no disinvestment then how the government is going to raise mony for healthcare and education. They will not sell any profit making PSU, who the hell then would like to buy loss making ones. The job of the goverment is to provide education, defense, healthcare and other important services and to watch and control all others sectors, goverments by definiition of democracy is for/by/of people and it should stay away from "owning" everything under the sun. Goverments job is not to - generate employment, its job is to -  provide employment i.e fine tuning the economy to make it more healthy and vibrant. But the Indian Government has always shown the tendency to own , by ownership,  the claws of corruption gets deep rooted. The free and conducive business environment lessens the ownership of Government and thus decreases the chance of corruption , which no Indian poltician would want. Lets hope for the best.

       The 3G GSM & CDMA in India  Reliance Indiamobile has heated the 'VAS on mobile' market with its  urlLink Rconnect  services which provides 144kbps Internet Access on its CDMA Mobiles. The Indian telecom operators are testing similar services and finding out the best suitable options through EDGE (GSM)  or EV DO (CDMA) Business Line India  urlLink Reports  :   CELLULAR subscribers can now get Live TV, watch videos and experience high speed Internet surfing on their mobile handsets with Idea Cellular and Hutch, on Wednesday, announcing the launch of EDGE (Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution) services. The service which has been launched for the first time in the country is capable of data downloads with speeds of 160 kilo bits per second compared to existing speeds of 40 kbps.  urlLink Airtel  is also planning a pan India roll-out by December.   While subscribers of  urlLink  Idea Cellular  can avail the service for a flat fee of Rs 500 per month,  urlLink Hutch  users can avail the service for a monthly fee of Rs 100 plus additional charges for downloads. For example, every game downloaded would cost Rs 50 and a ringtone download Rs 10. Idea Cellular subscribers also have the option of paying 5 paise per kilobyte. Subscribers will need EDGE-enabled handsets also to avail the service.        urlLink What is EDGE  ?    (GSMWorld.com)   Further enhancements in data capability over the core GSM network will be provided with the introduction of Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution - known as EDGE*. This will achieve the delivery of advanced mobile services such as the downloading of video and music clips, full multimedia messaging, high-speed colour Internet access and e-mail on the move.  EDGE (or Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution) is a 3G technology that delivers broadband-like data speeds to mobile devices. It allows consumers to connect to the Internet and send and receive data, including digital images, web pages and photographs, three times faster than possible with an ordinary GSM/GPRS network. EDGE enables GSM operators to offer higher-speed mobile-data access, serve more mobile-data customers, and free up GSM network capacity to accommodate additional voice traffic.      urlLink What is EV-DO   ? (Motorola)   1xEV-DO provides a true broadband service over mobile.

       The one-person global company - Business World India   urlLink Mahesh Murthy  gives us the  urlLink example  of one man global company.  LAST week I spent some time with a gent who runs a company in Mumbai that sells software to customers around the world. I had invested in them years ago, and for one reason or another we couldn't catch up much in the middle, except to share notes on email.  Things were going well. He was not huge by global standards - about $250,000 in revenues, slated to double this year. Customers in more than 30 countries. Over 500,000 people around the world who'd tried his product. Over 5,000 of them who had paid for it and who use it. A well-known brand in its field.  The business was profitable. He reckons he is world No.3 in his niche. His product was acclaimed worldwide, reviewed by PC Magazine and such. All in all, it was a pretty good record - having survived through the worst downturns in the market, and still making it. And we were talking of how he'd done it.  It wasn't that he was a coding or technical genius. The gent is actually a biology grad, and to my knowledge, can't write code. But he's always known what he wanted - and has figured out some inventive ways to get things done.

       MSN NEWS BOT & GOOGLE NEWS Comparison  People are getting more voracious for news these days. To satisfy the online news appetitie there are several sites scuh as Google News, Yahoo News, Newstrove, Moreover News Services , Topix.net and now MSN with their  urlLink News Bot . Microsoft has just  urlLink  launched  the beta test of Newsbot, a customized search-driven news . MSN News Bot offers  urlLink personalization  by searching on topics, and the service suggests stories based on what visitors have previously read.    But I find  urlLink Google News  more usefriendly and systematic, why doesn't Microsoft employ some good usability expert who can enlighten them on inetrface designing.   I compared MSN and Google News by searching for India on both  urlLink MSN Newsbot  &  urlLink Google News  and found that on Newsbot results obtained were containing mostly yesterdays Criket Match headlines, whereas  the google had identified them to be same and related, And arranged the other related news links below the the first result itself instead of showing different criket headlines.   Right now I cannot see the advantage of a search history on MSN but I do see the advantage of finding the related stories covered by different news sources. Is history really so useful ? , 'cos mostly people will be using one or two words to make the searches and not some complex string and may be they would be using the same search words daily. But on the other side  the collections of history links would be a sure advantage for some people who might be drilling for something more specfic or 'hard to find info / not so populated topic' and trying different combinations.   The the advantage of MSN Newsbot over Google News is that Newsbot has more sections and topics in the navigation and makes use of Java Scripts so that you can navigate the respective sections > subsections >  and related headlines just over the roll of your mouse.   One thing leaves me confusing , what does Microsoft wants to become, it is confused about its own identity or doing some sourch searching.  - Is there a need for Microsoft to become the next google ? - Is Microsoft really seeing a great opportunity in News and Search Engines market ? - Or simply it doesn't have anything else to do ?   Microsoft has started a online mag slate and is now thinking of  urlLink wiping it off . Why it doesn't concentrate on  urlLink Browser Wars  and try to give some peace to the exisitng users of Internet Explorer who are under constant threat. Microsoft seems to be concentrating on Mass or larger share of consumer market, even its patents are also very pathetic. With the kind of cash it has, it should now support real technological inventions or innovations.     And last but not the least I hate both of them for not providing the syndication feature through RSS.

       India : Telecom & Broadband Growth   India has become the unique example of telecom success in both GSM and CDMA. Indian operators have changed the equations of the telecom market. Earlier vendors used to always have the upper hand now they understand that they have to provide customized contracts and service and act as partners, cos India is a serious market and the opportunities are available starting from scratch - i.e at the level of Implementation phase. Thats why, you not only see implementations but India also becoming the test-bed or early implementator of some great telecom and broadband technologies. Every operator and vendor is now eyeing these 'Value Addition' technology and market and we will witness lots of new jargons in coming times like Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, EDGE, EV-DO, etc, etc.   The Indian  urlLink  telecom sector grew  to 79.4 million customers at the end of May'04 - a 39 percent annual growth that came mainly by the doubling mobile users. A recent paper by Telecom.paper.nl  urlLink estimates  (paid subscription) that there are 0.4 internet, 0.2 broadband connections per 100 people in India.  The broadband sector  is still at a very confusing stage since there is not a single technology which has stabilized, every vendor and every operator is singing a different tune. Even the discussion on connection to customer (medium) is divided into Wirelss / Copper / Fibre and Ethernet. The Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (TEMA) has  urlLink formed  the  India Broadband Forum primarily  to provide technical, strategic, and marketing support to its member organizations venturing in the development of broadband products and services.   The next phase will the coming of foreign Telecom / Networking / Broadband services for the need of outsourcing i.e Remote Management and Monitoring and other services. For example a recent announcement from COLT telecom to  urlLink move jobs  from Germany and UK to India. India is not only providing the manpower in the services market but there are many companies like Notel, Lucent, Cisco, Qualcomm, Juniper, etc for which India has become the R&D base also, for both the software and hardware.

       Mehmood : 1932 - 2004   urlLink Veteran Bollywood comedian, Mehmood, has died in the United States at the age of 72   I am a great fan of Mr. Mehmood, he was the true and may be the first "King Of Comedy" in the hindi film industry. I still remember a very simple but hillarious scene of "Pyar Kiye Jaa" in which he narrates a horror story to Omprakash , he was awarded Film Fare Award for that. Most of the comedians in India just use one method and repeat themselves in all their movies. But Mehmood was the first person who used make-up, accent, props and variety in his comedy. He was also ahead of time making movies such as Kuwara Baap, Padosan, Bombay to Goa, Jinny and Johny , etc. Padosan is still a terrific movie to watch , everytime you see it you experience the same madness. There is no other example of a true "comedy" in the Indian Masala movie industry. There is also a legend about him that once upon a time he became so popular among the audiences that Heroes (a typical lead character in every indian film) used to fear his presence in the movie and started boycotting him. One can simply put faith in this since he was the only comedian those days who gott to sing and dance with her very own female-sidekick (Helen, Durga Khote, Aruna Irani)  in all him movies.

       Michael Carr on Future Of Software Industry   urlLink Nicholas G. Carr  -  author of " urlLink Does IT Matter ? Information Technology and the Corrosion of Competitive Advantage" in his  editorial on New York Times writes about the future of the software industry. He is reacting on the Microsoft's decision to return $32 billion to its shareholders , according to to him it may be  a wise business move, but it is also an admission of defeat.   With its announcement this week that it will pay a special one-time dividend of $3 a share, the company is confessing that despite years of trying, it has not found an attractive way to invest its cash reserves. After decades of spectacular growth, the world's most famous software company seems resigned to a more sedate middle age.  Microsoft may be the biggest name in software, but its problem is not unique. In recent weeks, many of the largest suppliers of business software, like Computer Associates, Seibel Systems and Veritas, have announced that their growth will fall short of investors' expectations.   The software industry's sluggishness is not just a reflection of the vagaries of the economic cycle. It is a manifestation of a fundamental, if often overlooked, characteristic of the industry's product: software never decays. Machinery breaks down, parts wear out, supplies get depleted. But software code remains unchanged by time or use. In stark contrast to other industrial products, software has no natural repurchase cycle.

       Google gets personal  apcmag  urlLink informs  about the new  urlLink 'personalization ' feature of Google. :  Personalised search services collect information about the subjects which interest you, so a search engine knows in advance that you are interested in computers and not fruit. Google&rsquo;s version of personalisation does just this. After completing a profile, searches made at http://labs.google.com/personalized produce not just the usual list of results but also a &#8220;personalisation slider&#8221; to apply your profile to search results.   Set the slider to maximum and all results are subjected to an analysis based on your profile. Select minimum and the results revert to Google&rsquo;s standard service. Set the slider to somewhere between these two extremes and it will adjust the balance to reflect the placement.  The flipside for Google is that your profile also has the potential to allow it to charge more for advertising. At present, the profile is stored on users&rsquo; hard drives as a cookie and advertisers&rsquo; greedy mitts are kept away from its potential for targeted advertising.

       Survey Predicts Rise in IT Outsourcing  CFO.com  urlLink  reports   (Big Rise in IT Outsourcing, Says Survey)  about the recent survey conducted by  urlLink Patni Computer Systems Ltd  which says that nearly three-quarters of companies expect to increase their outsourcing budget by at least 20 percent over the next year and a half.  Fully 41 percent of respondents said they expected a 20 percent to 35 percent increase in their outsourcing budget during the next 18 months, 18 percent expected an increase of between 30 percent and 50 percent, and 13 percent expected an increase of 50 percent or more. Just 8 percent said that they expected no increase.  More than half &#8212; 54 percent &#8212; said that public perception has had no impact on their decisions to outsource. In fact, 30 percent said the only impact was on their ability to speak publicly about their initiatives. While 16 percent did concede that the debate over outsourcing made them reconsider their strategy, no respondents said that it forced them to postpone outsourcing altogether.  As for workforce-related risks: 43 percent of respondents cited lost knowledge, 38 percent singled out mismatched roles and competencies, and just 8 percent cited worker backlash.

       Creating STIM and PIN-News    urlLink Rajesh Jain  writes about localization and simplification of the Internet Content so that it becomes more relevant and intelligent -  the creation of an SME Trade Information Marketplace (STIM) and PIN-News.   In India, e-business has lagged primarily because of the lack of an Internet infrastructure in the country. There are signs that this is going to change in the near-term as cheaper computers combined with affordable always-on broadband connections will bring more consumers and businesses online. India&rsquo;s current base of 17 million users is expected to grow rapidly and touch 60-100 million in the next 3 years. Add to this the rapidly growing mobile users (already at 35 million) and India could be set for a boom in e-commerce in the coming years. A harbinger of this was the recent entry of eBay into India via the acquisition of Baazee.com for $50 million. Given this context, there are two platforms which can help dramatically accelerate e-business in India: the creation of an SME Trade Information Marketplace (STIM) and PIN-News.   STIM is about helping small- and medium-sized enterprises build and maintain an online presence, and connect with each other. By using two-way publish-subscribe technologies (wikis, weblogs, RSS aggregators), it will become much easier for SMEs to get out of the marketing trap that they find themselves in and grow their business. Each business needs to have an online presence comprising of four components: an &#8220;About Us&#8221; page in the form of a wiki which can be easily edited, a &#8220;What&rsquo;s New&#8221; page which has the new developments at the company both on the buy and sell side, a meta information page which gives contact and industry information and can be used by search engines to filter results, and a set of subscriptions based on keywords or topics which deliver the relevant updates from other SMEs, thus helping connect one business to other based on interest.   PIN-News is about building a bottom-up community information system. It is built around PIN codes. Neighbourhood events can be posted on to specific pages, organised in a weblog-format. By using standardized forms to do the post, it is possible to capture the information in XML format and use a matching engine to send out alerts to people. For example, if I am interested in book exhibitions or special offers, I can set up an alert on a few PIN codes around my home and workplace. When the book shops in the area do their updates (as part of STIM), I can be immediately alerted. PIN-News thus fills the gap in communicating dynamic information to people who are most likely to benefit from it.   Taken together, STIM and PIN-News can help make the Internet a utility in the lives of Indians and give the ones who do not have access a reason to get connected. It leverages the fact that much of our lives is spent in neighbourhoods and yet we know so little about it because our current media cannot get narrow enough to cost-effectively reach us. This is where the Internet and electronic &#8220;information marketplaces&#8221; can make a difference.

       Business World presents story of jalpaiguri  Do you now that our government runs a program called  urlLink Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (S G R Y)  ? No. No problems you can atleast know now how it is screwed.   Businessworld reports about the  urlLink The black hole of Jalpaiguri : (the last page of the article)  Miles away from Gudhiyarkuthi, in Delhi's Krishi Bhavan, the building housing the main office of the ministry of rural development, officials struggle with the fact that in 2003-04, Rs 264 crore was not used by the states to which the money was allocated by the Centre. "The problem is that, at the end of the year, when states don't use the funds they are allotted, this surplus money is allocated to other states. The problem is that the decision to allot the surpluses to another state is an essentially political one," says an officer. States like Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan are allotted the surpluses that other states will not spend.  Adds the officer: "Why should the surpluses be distributed to others? Not being able to use the funds reflects a failure of the bureaucracy in a state and in the districts. It's not that there is no poverty in those states." The officer points out that states like Punjab and Haryana are also allotted a large volume of foodgrains under the scheme. "This is absurd. Why do these states need the foodgrains when even the poor in these states buy directly from the market?"  The other problem is with the assets themselves that are created. Around 15 per cent of the funds are supposed to be for maintenance of the assets created in earlier years. "Unfortunately, we've found that not much of the money is used for maintenance," says the officer.   Ironically, even despite these problems, many believe that the Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojna is more successful than most other government schemes (See 'How The SGRY Works').   Will Manmohan Singh's proposals to transfer funds directly from the centre to the panchayats work? For all its faults, even in West Bengal where panchayati raj institutions are supposed to function more efficiently than in other states, village panchayats are the best institutions to judge how government money could be used in those areas. But they need to be made to work better. And one of the most important ways to do that is to put information in the hands of people like Kharen Roy.    Till that happens, Singh could spend all the money he wants - but the poor might still vote him out of power five years from now.

       Time to change the internet browser ?   The problems with the Microsoft's broswer software Internet Explorer are increasing day by day. Every day your hear about some new  urlLink warning  ,  urlLink patch ,  urlLink exploits  and so on. It can be said that Microsoft produces more patches than the application software. (And they say that Open source in insecure). The reason behind the problem getting so critical is that more than 95% internet population uses MS IE and that's the most wonderful opportunity and heaven for hackers, virus & worm developers developers, and all those who need an opportunity to screw. Just imagine find one bug / loop hole and the entire world is yours.  A wired  urlLink article   (Cool Ways to Give IE the Boot  )  looks at the different alternatives available in the internet browser market -  urlLink Mozilla FireFox  ,  urlLink irider  ,  urlLink Deepnet Explorer  ,  urlLink Opera  &  urlLink Safari  (mac).  Recently I have myself been a target of lots of Spyware, browser hijackers and trojans which are mainly due to IE's vulnerabilites. These are very annoying they are not only irrtating and frustrating but you also spend lots of time and efforts to eradicate them. Just imagine if a single person wastes 1-2 hours of internet time on some pain in the ass, how many would be wasting their time and energies all over the world ?.  Its time to change your browser honey .

       Wipro Anounces India's First RFID enabled Store   urlLink Wipro Technologies , the global IT services division of Wipro Limited (NYSE:WIT), announced  urlLink  the launch of its RFID enabled concept store  at its Electronic City campus. The concept store demonstrates how item level RFID tagging enables automatic check-out, intelligent shrinkage avoidance, smart stock maintenance, and tracing and tracking of apparel by the store manager. The concept store showcases RFID technology being used across different business processes in a retail store and has been launched to help customers understand the working of RFID in a real world environment. The concept store is part of the RFID center of excellence at Wipro Technologies.   The RFID Journal reports the  urlLink future plan  of WIPRO for RFID :  Recently, Wipro developed software that will schedule the correct number of cashiers to meet demand at the Metro Group's RFID-enabled Extra Future Store, in Rheinberg, Germany. Once the software is deployed, which is set to be happen within the next few months, customers can opt to have the bar code on their loyalty card scanned as they enter the store. The software will use those customers' shopping history to calculate when they are likely to reach the checkout register. The software will then assign staff to work the sales terminals so there will always be enough cashiers to meet customer demand, while freeing up staff to do other work when they are not required to process sales transactions.   Wipro maintains that its RFID software and services can be customized from applications that Wipro has already developed. "Products are 70 to 80 percent ready and then customized for individual customer requirements," says Bhanu Murthy, vice president, retail vertical at Wipro Technology, in Bangalore, India.   As an aid to its potential RFID customers, Wipro says it has developed its RFID return-on-investment (ROI) engine-a software program that can calculate the potential costs and returns for companies planning to deploy RFID. "This give a more accurate picture of potential cost than anything so far," says Murthy.     What is RFID ?    Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a method of remotely storing and retrieving data using devices called RFID tags. An RFID tag is a small object, such as an adhesive sticker, that can be attached to or incorporated into a product. RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver .  urlLink More on Wikipedia

       A Richer Future For India - McKinsey Study  Diana Farrell , the director of the McKinsey Global Institute, and Scratch Zainulbhai ,  director in theMcKinsey's  Mumbai office write a report on "  urlLink A richer future for India  "  The wealth generated by India's fast-growing information technology and business-process-outsourcing industries shows that the country has started living up to its economic potential. Unfortunately, they produce just 3 percent of GDP and employ less than one-half of 1 percent of the nonfarm labor force. By contrast, most sectors of India's economy remain shielded from global competition by high tariffs and restrictions on foreign direct investment and are thus woefully uncompetitive. Although some might argue that removing these barriers would threaten social objectives such as the protection of jobs and incomes, a robust economy would be more likely to realize them.  The take-away If India is to replicate the success of its IT and outsourcing industries elsewhere in its economy, its leaders must lower barriers to trade and encourage foreign investment in other sectors. .....More  (Preminum Content : Requires registration - Free)

       The Outsourcing Roundup : Backlash & Knowledge  NYT  urlLink reports   the fading outsourcing backlash in US :  As Indian outsourcing companies grew fearful that negative publicity would harm business, Nasscom tried to protect themselves by campaigning for outsourcing with lawmakers, government officials and industry lobbies in the United States and Europe.  But in the last two months, analysts say the backlash issue seems to be fading in importance to the American public and to United States businesses.   "No longer are customers prefacing outsourcing questions with what they should do to deflect the backlash issue," said Partha Iyengar, research director for Gartner in Mumbai. Gartner nonetheless still recommends that its United States clients continue with employee-impact assessments and community audits before embarking on outsourcing.  Some experts said they expected the concerns to be replaced by more pressing matters, like the shortage of skilled labor.  "Most companies are expanding so rapidly," Mr. Mehta of Nasscom said, "that we fear the new threat for outsourcing is not the backlash but the imbalance in supply of skilled professionals."   The hostility against outsourcing may have inadvertently helped the industry, some experts suggested.   "The backlash proved a gold mine of free publicity for Indian outsourcing companies," Mr. Iyengar of Gartner said. "For many U.S. companies, the backlash made offshoring a compelling proposition."   Even smaller outsourcing companies, like iGate Global Solutions, based in Bangalore, reached some deals after the controversy. The company, with $125 million in annual revenues and 4,000 employees, has customers like General Electric, GreenPoint Financial and Kraft Foods.   "The backlash issue made outsourcing so mainstream that even my barber was speaking knowledgeably about outsourcing," said iGate's chief executive, Phaneesh Murthy, who is based in Fremont, Calif.     In political circuits too the voices we hear now are somewhat different as kerry  urlLink accepting  the outsourcing  "We recognise that outsourcing is a reality, but at the same time, we want to develop our jobs and industries more at home here too. But Senator Kerry is an internationalist and I think India should welcome him as an American President,&#8221; Richardson told reporters when asked about his party&rsquo;s strident posture against outsourcing.     Even then people are not short of Myths and still more knowledge is required on this subject . Far from damaging the economy of the United States, offshoring should enable its companies to direct resources to next-generation technologies and ideas -- if public policy doesn't get in the way. - A  urlLink report  on CFO.com

       India Infotech Cheer  Business Standard  urlLink reports  cheer in the indian infotech market :  Infosys Technologies' first quarter results for 2004-05 have comfortably beaten the street, both on revenues and earnings. Far more significant, though, is the upward revision in its guidance for this fiscal.      According to the company's revised estimates, income growth for the full year is expected to be around 40 per cent, while earnings per share are expected to grow at 34 per cent. That's a healthy rate of growth.      Given the fact that the Infosys management has traditionally been very conservative about guidance, the markets will undoubtedly re-rate the company, especially as it trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of well below its annual earnings growth rate.      But Infosys' revised guidance also sends another strong signal to the market - a pointer whose implications go far beyond the effect on a particular stock.      Taken together with MphasiS BFL recent results and its management's upbeat assessment of prospects, the signal going out loud and clear is that the outlook for Indian software services has changed significantly for the better.

       Banking for Rural India   Rajesh Jain  urlLink Quotes   urlLink WSJ  :  Engineers at the Indian Institute of Technology here [in Chennai] smile as they watch a magic brown box grumble, groan and then spit out 12 dirty 10-rupee notes, each valued at about 18 European cents.  They have built India's first rural automated teller machine to serve remote areas of the subcontinent. It can process the worn notes in small denominations that are the main currency in Indian villages, and at $800, or about &euro;650, the machine costs less than one-twentieth the price of a regular ATM.  India's Icici Bank Ltd., with the help of the institute in Chennai -- formerly Madras -- and others, has developed the village ATM from inexpensive homemade parts and programming. Despite its low price tag, the machine is built to survive extreme weather and power outages. It can tell when two ragged notes get stuck together and can scan fingerprints to identify rural savers who are illiterate or are reluctant to use a personal-identification number. The ATM will be tested at an Icici branch in Chennai this month. If it works, the rugged ATM eventually could be used at hundreds of Internet kiosks in remote areas of India.  The project is more than an altruistic attempt to improve the lives of rural Indians. It is the latest example of how India's nimble private-sector banks try to use local high-tech skills to squeeze profits out of small savers.  Indian companies such as HDFC Bank Ltd. and Icici didn't exist until deregulation opened the market to private banks in the 1990s. Now, they boast millions of customers and are among the most-profitable and fastest-growing companies in India. HDFC and Icici both have seen their profits grow by more than 30% annually during the past five years.  The trick, they say, is technology. In a country where most potential savers make less than $100 a month, the banks have mastered ways of attracting small customers, even when they hold accounts with a minimum balance of $100. Setting up a national network of full-fledged branches was too expensive, so the banks expanded using ATMs, phone banking and the Internet to reach new customers inexpensively.  "The challenge is that the transaction sizes are very small by international standards," says Neeraj Swaroop, country head of retail banking at HDFC in Bombay. "We were able to do it in an economically viable manner by investing in the right kind of technology."  Thanks to affordable technologies, the most advanced banks in India say more than 70% of transactions are done outside branches. "They are aggressively targeting the customer like never before," says Gurunath Mudlapur, head of research at Khandwala Securities in Bombay. "They are using a lot of innovation for the Indian context."

        India's Digital Village Via Slashdot  Slashdot has this  urlLink discussion  [ India's Digital Village] about project  urlLink Bhoomi  covered  urlLink comprehensively  in  Business Week by Manjeet Kripalani. Kripalani also writes about how the digitial evolution is bringing information explosion by bringing the equality in information access. Though majority of the people do not have understanding about these digital things, they have the power and ability to access the information through easily-operable devices like Kiosks. Outsiders may not understand the difference, but in India access to information is very big thing due to red-tapism and corruption. Now one doesn't have to slip in green fuel (bribe) inside the kiosks to get any information.  sirdude writes "Business Week has a pretty comprehensive story on the impact of projects such as Bhoomi, which are slowly but surely bridging the digital divide in rural India. With entrepreneurial initiatives such as e-choupal, Simputer, and a multitude of other privately-funded projects also beginning to take root, the rural Indian (who comprises about 70% of India's population), is slowly inching his way into the information age. The rest of the third world is watching & waiting, and taking detailed notes :)" And the parts about computerized land records may remind anyone who's read it of Hernando De Soto's The Mystery of Capital.    urlLink Project Bhoomi   Under this prestigious Bhoomi E-Governance project of the Government all 20 million land records of 6.7 million land owners in 176 taluks of Karnataka have been computerised. This system works with the software called "BHOOMI" designed fully in-house by National Informatics Center, Bangalore. While the project is largely funded by Government of India; some critical components of this project are funded by State Government.

Find more about the  urlLink Patent Busting Project  & How big is this patenting problem ?  Every year numerous illegitimate patent applications make their way through the United States patent examination process without adequate review.

       Ittium : Licensing Intellectual Property  Till now we have seen services company and product companies. All the major IT giants in India like Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Satyam .... are dominantly Services Company. There are very few handful of product companies in India due to lack of maturity in country, policies, market , finanance, talent, attitude and lots of other business environment factors. Some companies like  urlLink Ittium Systems  has taken a middle path called 'IP Licensing' for example they do not code on project basis for some other product company, instead they provide their code on "Royaly Basis". This has enabled them to have decent revenues and profits. The reason for others not following this model is (a) one cannot expect to generate revenue in 100s millions, since this working models has a specfic need and application (2) The IP licensing based companies has to continuously search for new contracts and projects since the tenure of a license is very short 3-5 years max as it appplies to a product in which the technology is used and the product life cycle is very short these days.

       India Inc. not so net savvy  Geeta Nair  urlLink writes  in her article on Express computer , that India Inc. is a poor Internet User. Most of the people have not realized the potential of the net besides having a brochure-converted-in-to-website and Emails. There is lot to be done in the space of Knowledge Management and providing information and service to the customer through web and other internet channels. Most of the times one cannot even find the contact addresses of the company's branches and profile of people managing the company. There is a lot of value-addtion to be added just by tweaking the web site and providing that "extra information" which everybody is looking for. Most of the times I find web sites as the worst examples of Usability, a compulsory intro flash animation, a nifty abous us page, services which will mimic the Wipro's & infosys's of the worlds and contact page form without any contact (email / tel no.) listed , as if they run some secrete operations  Most Indian companies seem to be content using the Internet solely for sending e-mail rather than utilising it as a value-added tool for business. They appear to be unwilling to use the Internet for information dissemination as well as a medium to do business. &#8220;The domestic industry by and large has been somewhat myopic and even ignorant about the benefits and the need to incorporate the Internet as part of its marketing and business strategy. The fundamental power of the Internet as a low-cost and highly effective tool for disseminating information is being undervalued,&#8221; states a study conducted by ValueNotes Database.    ValueNotes is a leading provider of business intelligence and research, and is one of the largest aggregators of information on Indian business and finance. It conducted the survey following global reports that pointed out the poor leveraging of the Internet by Indian companies. It covered a cross-section of 50 big and small companies.

       Indian President Advises Open Source Approach | Via Slashdot    A Slashdot  urlLink Story  :  geo_2677 writes "The Indian President Dr. A Kalam has advised defense scientists to go for open-source software for software security, rather than be stuck with insecure proprietary software. Being a scientist himself, he surely knows what's good for his country." Speaking at the Indian Navy's Weapons and Electronic System Engineering Establishment, Kalam argued: "Open source codes can easily introduce the users to build security algorithms in the system without the dependence of proprietary platforms", though continues: "We should take maximum care to ensure that our solution is unique to protect our own defence security solutions implemented on open platforms." We previously reported on Richard Stallman's meeting with Dr. Kalam earlier this year.

       Where is Sanchar Kranti : Avinash Murkute  Avinash Murkute , a  Nagpur (India) based freelance columnist  urlLink writes  about Bribe Dependant Phones & Bribe Sanchar Nigam Limited's dadagiri and monopoly.    Where is Sanchar Kranti:  Revolution (Kranti) is always universal. If things happening at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkatta, Mumbai should be termed as revolution then there is serious flaw in the way of thinking. It is sure cheating with the rural India. If we are talking about GDP and neglecting rural then we are committing crimes. It dials digital divide. Rural &#8211; Urban differentiation is like putting the clock back. Governmental schemes are implemented on paper only. Take example of Internet Dhabas.    In Internet Dhaba beneficiary was allotted waiting free, deposit free, rent free, Internet access free telephone connection. Such Dhabas (Kiosks) were supposed to be set at every Taluka level. The Principal General Managers who played God by taking credit of implementing this scheme was in facto demon. They allotted such phones on bribes. So in the age of Internet Nirvana rural India is Internet free and eventually virus free also. It is good to have virus in computer system than to have virus in minds like BSNL infected with bribe virus.    This challenging, feeble, depraved rural India needs Telecom God. They wish to throw up an inferior service provider like BSNL. A true Indian will always disdain &#8220;Hindustan-ke-Gaddar&#8221; in BSNL. Rural even doesn&rsquo;t wish to worship false telecom god and false telecom ministers. They need a deluxe telecom god who can provide them bribe free basic telephony at par with rest of the world and punish bribe licensee. It&rsquo;s so simple GDP is inversely proportional to bribe? Sure we are talking about GDP only and illegal telephone(s) are still working, smiling at TRAI.    Link :  * Googling for  urlLink Avinash Murkute

        The WMD incubators : Bush Jr. copies Bush Sr.  Just accidentally came through this story about the last gulf war. The entire WMD shit is mere inheritence of Bush from his father.  In October, 1990, a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, identified only as Nayirah, appeared in Washington before the House of Representatives' Human Rights Caucus. She testified that Iraqi soldiers who had invaded Kuwait on August 2nd tore hundreds of babies from hospital incubators and killed them.    Television flashed her testimony around the world. It electrified opposition to Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, who was now portrayed by U.S. president George Bush not only as "the Butcher of Baghdad" but -- so much for old friends -- "a tyrant worse than Hitler."    Bush quoted Nayirah at every opportunity. Six times in one month he referred to "312 premature babies at Kuwait City's maternity hospital who died after Iraqi soldiers stole their incubators and left the infants on the floor,"(1) and of "babies pulled from incubators and scattered like firewood across the floor." Bush used Nayirah's testimony to lambaste Senate Democrats still supporting "only" sanctions against Iraq -- the blockade of trade which alone would cause hundreds of thousands of Iraqis to die of hunger and disease -- but who waffled on endorsing the policy Bush wanted to implement: outright bombardment. Republicans and pro-war Democrats used Nayirah's tale to hammer their fellow politicians into line behind Bush's war in the Persian Gulf.(2)...........    urlLink Read more on Counterpunch.org    Links :  *  urlLink Bush's Iraq Lies   *  urlLink RW ONLINE:"Wagging the Dog":US/Kuwait Incubator Scam   *  urlLink In war, some facts less factual   *  urlLink UnitedStatesGovernment.net - How Bush Sr. Sold The Bombing Of Iraq   *  urlLink When contemplating war, beware of babies in incubators | csmonitor ...

       Microsoft Goes Cheap to woo Asia   urlLink Microsoft  is proposing to expand an offer to supply Asian countries with a simpler,  urlLink cheaper version of its Windows operating system  in an apparent effort to curb software piracy and dent  urlLink  the appeal  of the open-source Linux system in the region. Or could this be proactive measure by Microsoft to avoid the "perfect storm",  as  urlLink pointed out  by Franklin Fisher. He had also testified during Microsoft-US Justice Department anti-trust trial in 1999, that customers believed there were no serious commercial contenders to the Windows operating system at that time. The story is very different now with  urlLink Sun ,  urlLink IBM and  urlLink Oracle  going guns with Open Source. Besides competition MS faces challenges from the very large asian developer community who are also  urlLink supported  by their goverment, organizations and intellectuals.

        MAKING TECHNOLOGIES WORK FOR THE POOR  Dr. R. A. Mashelkar (Secretary  urlLink DSIR  & Director General,  urlLink CSIR  )  writes for Press Information Bureau :  urlLink  MAKING TECHNOLOGIES WORK FOR THE POOR . Here I take the exceprt related to the Computer Based Functional Literacy program  The great doyen of Indian IT industry, Shri F.C Kohli believes that this can be done through his recent breakthrough. He has developed a unique Computer-based Functional Literacy (CBFL) method. It is based on the theories of cognition, language and communication. In this method, the scripted graphic patterns, icons and images are recognized through a combination of auditory and visual experiences by using computers. The method emphasizes on learning words rather than alphabets.   Based on this method, Shri Kohli's team has developed innovative methodologies using IT and computers to build a reading capability among the adult illiterates. This experiment was first conducted in Medak village near Hyderabad. Without a trained teacher, the women started reading the newspaper in Telugu in 8 to 10 weeks. Thereafter, his team has carried out more experiments in 5 States and in 5 languages. So far, 40,000 people have been made literate in these pilot experiments.  The team ran these lessons on Intel 486s and the earlier versions of Pentium PCs modified to display multimedia. There are around 200 million of such PCs in the world that are obsolete and discarded. They can be made available free of cost. By using these PCs, the cost of making one person literate would be less than Rs.100.  How does one set up a telephone exchange in a village in the Rajasthan desert in India, where temperatures that go beyond 50 C and the sand storms create unmanageable dusty conditions. It was Centre for Development of Telecommunications (C-DOT) in India that designed the rural exchanges, which could withstand these aggressive conditions.

       The Data Protection Risk In the BPO  The  business process outsourcing (BPO) industry in India is  urlLink growing  at 40-50 percent per annum despite protests against shipping of jobs in some countries and generating revenues  to the tune of $3.6 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. The new concern in the BPO sector is about the "Data Protection" and India is considered to be 'risky' but according to the new  urlLink survey  conducted by Hill & Associates  ; Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad have emerged as key no-risk locations and there is no such great risk at other locations also.    Detailing the findings of the survey on information security, Sonal said, &#8220;Globally, 60-70 per cent of corporate frauds are estimated to have been committed within the organisation. These include factors like security breaches, loss of information and damage to reputation.&#8221;      Infact, we have a seperate programme for pre-employment screening to address this issue."      Stating that focus needs to be given on data protection, he said that data moves out of the company as and when an employee moves out of the organisation.      "Today, nearly 20 per cent of the security concerns are on falsification of resumes, especially when an employee moves to another organisation. If this cannot be addressed in a cohesive manner, it becomes market knowledge and people will stop applying for jobs in such companies."
