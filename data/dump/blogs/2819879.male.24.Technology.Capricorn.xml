      I was going to take a nap but soon realize that if i do fall asleep, won't be able to wake up anytime soon...  So...  I had a weird dream last night.  It was about me and my x-gf and Ken and his gf all went out to a summer vacation trip.  We ended up in a grand hotel of some unknown island, the sun is shining and there's no cloud you can see in the vast blue sky.  Anyways, it was a beautiful dream to start with.  But while I was sleeping in one of the hotel's room (Yeah, I dreamed about sleeping), all of a sudden I woke up and decided to take a stroll in the hall.  It was a couple hours past mid-night and there I was loitering in the hallway doing nothing.  When all of a sudden, all the doors starts to open and close and open and close on me.  Of course that scared the hell out of me so I ran to the escalator trying to get out of this haunted hotel... and somehow as I ran, I can see my friends outside of the window, on the grass, eating and chatting and having a great time by themselves.  I was desperate to join them and even more desperate trying to get out of the building (the doors are still opening and closing), and that's when I wake up.  I can still remember what the hotel looks like and I'm sure it's nothing I've seen before.  Weird dreams as it is...  Jeffrey. Out.

He excels in many things that echos his name, for example, play street fighter as Ken and study at Chem.  This picture is taken last winter in Osaka ... something train.  When we went there together.  He is going to be a successful pharmacist.  Going to tackle the big exam in a couple days.  Wish him all the BEST!!  BY THE WAY, He thinks that his eye looks like Jay Chou (the Pop-Music King) in this picture.

      "I'm so tired of working..."  She used to be a happy, grateful and determined young girl.  And I was shocked to hear those words from her mouth.  It's not the words that shocks me but the way she said it.  She sounds exhausted and desperate (of getting out).  If there's anything I have learned from the past 2 years of working life - it's that "People do change".  Little by little, piece by piece, many old friends of mine changed a lot after they start working.  Me too, although I have considered myself pretty resistent to change.  But even I can notice that I have sorta lost the passion I used to have, the fulfilling sense of completion is gradually fading away as well.  Believe or not, I used to be happy just because I learned how to rap a song; finished a boss from videogame; getting a new comic book.....  Doing those things nowadays... still excites me, but not as much... anymore.  Speaking of which, no wonder i'm getting a lot of "I'm so bored!!!!!" from my friends these days.  And I'm kinda scared... what will happen when the feeling has totally fade away?  Would I become a dull adult like those people I see everyday on bus, MRT and train?  Is it inevitable?

      17th eh? 10 more days to go before my dear mom leaves me alone...  Curretly at 78kg, still have 8kg to go before I win the "Grand Dinner".  Hmm... maybe I do have to speed up a little, it's been 3 weeks already and i only lost 2kg.  I've seen people (My Cousin, Julian) lost 20+ kg over a period of time.  And seriously, salute to them.  For some of us, to lose weight in a healthy way is really not an easy path to take.  As it requires time, effort, resistance to food and many many other factors in order to succeed.  Losing weight is both a mental and physical game, and DAMN for how hard this game is.  It's just so not right - how come (generally) all the food that taste best to me are considered to be "bad food" to my health. There must be something wrong with my blueprint.  My designer should have designed me the way that whenever I do the stuff that pleases myself (without violates other people's rights, of course), I become healthier and healthier. Or, at least, when I'm trying to do something to damage myself, the warning siren should be more immediate and "LOUDER PLEASE!!". For example, when i'm already overweight, whenever I eat KFC chicken, make me puke asap...  Hmm... It's hard to deny that I wasn't complaining. But no, I wasn't complaining.  It's just something to think of... maybe this universe or "GOD" or supernatural force or whatever u calls it, works in mysterious ways that my puny little brain will never be able to understand its true purpose and reason.  And no, I'm not trying to understand it. Because I don't have wings, so I would never try to fly.  Until then...  P.S. If none of you understand what I'm talking about, it's okay, me either...

      Last night I was talking to a very angry girl.  She said she has been conspired by her love-of-life and her best friend. Her x-bf was going out with her best friend for like 5 or 6 month before she "accidently" rat them out. "No wonder last Valentines was 3 of us going out together instead of we going out alone!", she proclaimed in anger.  Well, I didn't know exactly how to make her fell less furious about the whole thing.  So after she went on for like 25+ Minutes (I was playing WarCraft while she's complaining), I said "at least now you have found out the truth, start to look for another guy already, he is a total jerk and you can do much better."  But then she said, "If I never find out the truth, I would be much happier and we can all still be good friends with each other. Now I have lost my bf and my best friend in return of the truth, if that's the case, I would rather live a lie."  Because I was still playing Warcraft so I wasn't thinking much about what she said.  Afterall, that was just a super lame story going on everyday around us, people who go out with their best friends and so on... :p  But now I think of it, perhaps hiding the truth away would be for the best in many occasions. What if... she never find out?  Would that lead to a happier ending?  Just something to think of... while I'm drifting mindlessly on Elevator -> Scooter -> Escalator -> Train -> Escalator -> MRT -> Escalator -> Bus -> Elevator to office everyday.  And reverse the above routine while going back home...  Oh yeah, I had her permission to post it here, since none of you who read this knows her... maybe ...  Anyways... it's no biggie... She's a happy girl and I'm sure she'll be able to walk out of it in no time.  On the other hand, in many ways, I wish I can be as tough as she is...

      Somehow... this month seems longer than any others.  To me, May is a very special month.  1998.05.21 was the first day I've gotten my first gf.  And 2 years ago, it was the month I graduate from UBC.  Although all those things used to seems critical in my life, after so many years, they seems to be less and less important to me nowadays...  The question is... will anything happen to me... anything super special, this month?  So far, seems highly unlikely.  I'm too chicken to go after any girls.  I still can't fully make up my mind about the whole going back stuff.  I still can't c myself in 5... or 6 years...  Okay, there's one special thing - it's gonna be the first time I pay tax and fill out the forms all by myself, the first time in my life...  Not a very pleasant thing compare to those good old ones, eh?  The whole growing up thing... one has to face more and more unhappy things instead of happy ones.  Seriously, I want to write down some happy stuffs here.  But so far, the only thing I can think of ... is Nintendo's next handheld, NDS.  Hopefully, it's going to be super super super great.  But I read a stupid negative news on google about how the duel screen's cost will hurt Nintendo in many ways.  Since each and every cellphone, mp3 player... whatever, needs LCD screen nowadays.  LCD screen's shortage has made them more and more expansive.  This sure will be a big concern for Nintendos...  See? Even the happiest thing so far has its dark side...  I should give up just now...

      Like Starcraft... I find myself repeatedly going back to play Warcraft III.  Blizzard is really an awesome company, I have to admit.  I've made a bet with little Jeff that I'll lost 10kg before he gain 10kg.  Somehow, I'm confident that I can win this bet.  And by the way, it's the biggest bet I've ever had in my life.  And lose 10kg won't be easy...  Time really flies...  Day after day, week after week.  1 hour seems like nothing nowadays.  And a week or 2 seems not so far away.  I have this theory that "as we grow up, we get used to 'time'".  Like when u sit in hot water (bearable hot water) long enough, you don't feel hot anymore - when we have passed enough time, we don't feel time passing by anymore.  Time & Spaces are... miracles... if God is almighty, would He be able to turn back time?  Funny whenever I starts writing on blog, I feel like ... sad ...  Interesting, gotta investigate how come the way things are the way they are...

      Cloudy and Windy all day.  It's my first time this year riding scooters all the way to office.  Rather Stupid, I think.  The reason of doing that still bothers me.  Maybe it's because I'm going to Dan-Sui tonight and may not be able to go home early.  Mom is coming tomorrow and because of her heavy luggage, I shall go airport and pick her up.  As a side note... I'm still not sure if go back for acturary is a good idea...

Everyone knew you can do it!!!!!!!   This is a super important milestone for you.

Will the damn slow turtle Typhoon ever come?   This morning I've meet the most incredible Sunny-Rain.  It was broad day-light and the sun is shining as hard as every other morning.  The sky was blue with a few clouds here and there, yet, if you feel closely, "THERE ARE RAINDROPS!!"  Thanks to the typhoon, that was an incredible weather...  -------------------------------------------------------------  3rdly, today is the first day this week i'm only 15 min. late to office...  That's not as noteworthy as the last 2... but...

      這幾天坐火車突然一直聽到站長重複這句話: "拿磁卡的旅客請走自動門" - 因為我每天都用磁卡上下班，所以也沒特別在意，只是覺得奇怪怎麼突然開始提醒大家。  今天早上才發現: 原來現在連自動櫃員機出的票都是磁卡... 小張的磁卡... 可能再過幾年車站也會變成全自動的ㄌ...  其實我之前就想過ㄌ, 反正站長站在那邊也沒什麼路用...

"剛考完學測阿"  "考的好嗎?"  "爛爆ㄌ, 我英文只拿 11 分耶 ^_^, 沒辦法, 後段班的就是醬"  "ㄟ... 好像真的蠻差ㄉ"  "對阿, 遇到英文我就掛點ㄌ"  "那你怎麼不叫你爸媽教你?"  "我爸媽? 你說那兩個白痴喔?"  ............  My co-worker was shocked... (she is playing with her daughter)...  Is that how kids nowadays call their folks?

      Finally......  My busy (?) days are over.  Everything seems to be coming to a nice halt right now.  Of course, there are still some follow-ups to do...  These are the things I have finally done:  1. Unblocked my ubc regisration. (FINALLY!!!) 2. Got ticket to Japan. (FINALLY!!) 3. Michael and Tony left.  Hopefully I can start working out again.  Shall not be too busy after tomorrow (Rola Left).  There are only 4 things on my agenda so far...  1. Rola's b-day 2. Jeremy's vacational weekend 3. Allen coming back (7/5?) 4. Register for courses (7/7)  ----------------------------------------------------------------  There was a super stupid police around Neo 19.  After Room 18 on last friday, I asked him if tony can take alcohol test to make sure if he can drive or not.  But he replyed (with very annoying attitude) "怎麼問這麼笨的問題ㄋ?" "你把車開過來, 一次定生死阿".......  What a jerk.  I should have take his name down or his badge number or whatever...  Stupid and useless cops...  ------------------------------------------------------------------  On the other hand... if I were the cop, I can probably list the following reasons why should I be rude...  1. Working so late at a hot summer night really gets on my nerve, and I have to wear this heavy uniform...  2. A bunch of drinking rich kids who spend their parent's money and hook up girls at club.  Well... I reckon that he was just jealous because of stereotype.  If he knew that we were just some normal kids who want to drive safely and make no trouble for other people, he would probably let us take the test.  :)  ----------------------------------------------------------  I ought to put down some notes about 基隆 and betelnuts, but i'll probably do that until my HELLO is fixed.  ...

      嗚~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  該做的事都沒做~~~~~~~~  When will I be able to call UBC for advising...?  ... sign ...  這星期 so 想去 workout, 但是 thanx to Tony and Michael, 我都沒辦法去... >  It's not that I don't welcome Michael's staying, 有朋自遠方來, 不亦樂乎, but I do have complain about Tony letting me know too late and thus kinda interfering with my other plans.  Actually Michael is a good guy to live with, Taiwan's living condition is not as good as other places, but he has no complain at all.  He won't bother my sleep hour.  He is quiet.  All in all, it's not much trouble living with him.  But still, I have 2 problems with his staying (But nothing personall, both are my own problem):  1. It's common sense that a guest coming all the way from the other end of earth, I'll have to take him out and stuff...  But everyday I still have to work --> and that is very tiresome...  Of course, I can choose to sleep early everyday and don't treat him at all, but... I choose to tire myself... it's no one's fault but mine.  2. That's another personal stuff... and it's a long story. Basically, my renter downstairs pays for my electricity - and she complains ALL THE TIME about how much electricity I spend in summer.  She was super annoying and always trying to deduct the electricity from her renting fee.  Anyways, so this summer, (because I don't like her at all), I tried super hard to use as little electricity as possible.  No Air Condidtion at any time if I'm alone in the house.  I would use Fans only. Until Michael came................ Of course, it's not polite to my guest if I don't turn on the air con --> For it is damn too hot in taiwan.  I'm not 小氣, because I don't pay the electricty, gotta nothing to do with me.  It's just that... the renter is doomed to file complain this month... and it's not a pleasant thought... >  Anyhow, Tony & Michael, if you are reading this ...   Tony, next time tell me earlier about the plans. Dai Aho~~~~  Michael, we had a lotta fun together, and I think it's a very great idea to travel around in Asia before you start working.  Although my place can't offer you the best accommodation, I do sincerely hope that you had lots of fun and enjoy the stay in Taiwan.  I'll see you back in Vancouver soon~  Jeffrey... out...

In so many ways, they are just victims of the plot of the evil importing company.  Forced to play a game that lacks depth... the only fun you get is human interaction.  But that's the jewel of MMO.  If L II is a single player game, I wonder if it'll sell 1/10 of what they have sold now...

It's interesting to know that only 5% of mammel has 1 single mate for life.  If human genes can be altared the same way, is it a good... or a bad thing?  Sounds like a good idea to me...

Well... maybe it's a coincedence, if he has a SAAB Alchokey as I just posted this morning, (please refer to the previous article), he probably won't die.  Anyways, that reminds me of my uncle who passed away at around the same age last year.  He was because of stroke...  No Alchokey would have saved my uncle.  May all who passed away be able to rest in peace.

      I was on the train coming back from Taipei... and this... I think rather funny thing happened.  Although, in a way, I'm a victim as well.  So I get on this train heading home from Taipei. And 車上有個很白濫的男生, 大概二十幾歲, 高高壯壯的, 抱著他女朋友坐在靠角落的位置 (他女朋友在睡覺). 白濫的地方是 - 他放了一個包包在他左手邊, 佔去一個人的位置. 車上雖然不擁擠, 但還是有許多人站著.  我故意坐在他包包旁邊, 他也不把包包移開, 就繼續抱著他女朋友, 視若無睹其他站著的人...  Anyways, on the train, I was reading LoR as usual. Holding the book while ignoring others around me.  At the next station, 萬華, I couldn't help but notice that a pair of pretty legs appeared in front of me. Yeap, a girl wearing short skirt is standing in front of me and the 包包 beside me.  So, I tried to pretend stretching (as usual) and took a peep at her.  恩... 還算 ok 可愛. 台北女生敢穿短裙的都不會太差.  伸完假懶腰以後, 我就當然繼續看書.  After the train has left the station, 坐在我旁邊包包旁邊那各男生似乎也注意到她. 結果~~~~~~~~~ 超白濫的~~~~~~~~  他竟然把包包拿起來放在地上, 屁股還向旁扭ㄌ兩下 --> 擺明是要她坐下來.  怪事, 上一站前面站ㄌ一各媽媽, 他怎麼沒注意到.  除了暗罵那各男的可以再白一點, 其實我也在等那各女生坐下來. 但是似乎太明顯ㄌ, 那各女生遲遲不肯坐下, 還倒退ㄌ點.  結果~~~~~~~~~~ 一個大概至少一百公斤重的中年人, 身上帶著重重的體味 (不是檳榔或菸酒味, 就是那種十天沒洗澡的怪味), 竟然從車廂另一邊擠過來, 坐在我旁邊的空位上...  前面那個女生當然早就遠遠躲開, 可是我坐在那邊又不能下車, 只好忍受ㄌ十幾分鐘奇怪的味道...  真是夠ㄌ...

Well, in the movie, Aragon doesn't look like anywhere close to 87...  Although he does lived 210 years... so... propotionally, his appearance should be like around 40ish...?

      Yesterday night was the Last Fairwell party for John and Jeremy.  At CashBox Sogo, we sang until 2 in the morning.  It was pretty sad.  And I thought I'm already used to people parting.  I was wrong.  It still gets me when the time finally comes.  When there's a beginning, there's always an end.  Therefore, the only thing endless, would be something that never begins.  ...  Rather sad to be a mortal.  Maybe A. Smith is right; maybe human beings do define our reality through suffering and misery.  Of course, if this world is without suffering and misery, how do we know we are happy when the time comes?  If we are bind to and will never leave people whom we love, will we still precious the days we spend together?  Probably not.

      6/13 Sunday Morning 7:26  Finished Lord of the Ring Book I.  To be honest, Book I was rather... slow paced, compare to The Hobbits.  But I really appreciates its attention to detail. The world of Arda is really... amazing...  By the way, that was when I woke up from e-cafe and on my way home.  I'll get back to that when I fixed my computer @home.

      Last Monday, I had one of the most fun moment with Super Smash Brother Melee (SSBM).  It was major entertaining because, while I'm still the worst, all the player's level are fairly close to each other.  And we had one intensive fight after another.  It was really really enjoyable and super fun.  In the order of 1v1 strength:  Jeremy - Sheik, Ice Climber, Yoshi John - Fox, Link Jeffrey - Pikachu, Samus, Mario, Marth, Fox  At first, we played FFA, stock 3.  And John soon realize that Fox is not really good in FFA and changed to Link. Most of the time, Sheik or Pika win out.  Thanx to Pika's powerful thunder and Sheik's fastness.  The problem with Link is, although he does gets the most KOs, after either pika or shiek is dead, poor Link still has to duel the remaining player.  And unless he has some major % advantage, it's really a tough fight for him.  Link's cool down time, like pikachu, is too long.  And without a good come-back-move, no wonder he is rather weak compare with others of same level.  Later, we play 1v1 loser out.  Because the day before, Sheik really beat the hell out of my Pika, and I've had some Fox nightmare before, so I was reluctant in starting 1v1 tournment. But it turns out that I can really fight even (or almost even) with Fox!  And if Luck is with me, I can also beat Sheik!!  Pika is not a super bad choice of character after all.  And after the tournment, we all laugh at little turtle's choice of characters - punch-bag Browser and feather-light Kirby.  Smart choice... really... no offence...

An interesting poem in Book I foretelling what'll happen in Book VI...  THIS is something that Harry Potter can never do.  Yeah, yeah, the bolt-head and Harry's relationship with Him-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, those are just baits for readers, secrets waiting to be revealed, not a foreshadowing of anything.

      Still 1.5 hour to go, Friday afternoon, but I don't feel like working anymore.  Just had a pretty bad argument with one of my best friends, well, it was, rather unpleasant.  He was right on one thing: sometimes I do argue for the sake of arguement, even I don't fully believe the thing i'm defending for, I'll make myself believe it while arguing it.  Even though, I know very well that whatever I said wouldn't prove or disprove anything at the end.  And honestly, he is wrong on one thing: He said I've changed (in a blaming way, at least that's what i felt). He is wrong because:  (I have to make my points clear, so i list them out)  1. There's no need to blame, of course I've changed, after living out a different life, everyone will change.  People adopt to the environment and it should be a good thing.  One can't blame another just because their value is different.  2. It's not "I've change", even it is, it should be "we've changed".  Because, simply, in his eye, I have changed, and in my eye, he has changed.  3. I really don't think we have changed.  I find Grown up people pretty resistant to change.  And you really can't change a person much just in a couple days or months.  The world around us is different now, but we are still the same.  Anyways, I have to admit that it was my fault today.  Maybe the weary of getting out of this office is really getting on my back.  And... if you are reading this, I am terriblly sorry for ruinning your happy mood.  I wasn't being defencive, it was worse, I was being negative. I know you worked very hard last couple month, and finally it's pay-off time.  I should be, no, I AM happy for you.  However, what I've said was 100% true.  I don't think the chance of getting it is high, but if I can find a job I love and live close to the ones I love... what else would I ever want?  Well, I won't find out until then.  Humans are known to be greedy.  But, until then, that's just what I want... for now.

      Here's a little Luigi's Bibliography  Luigi Mario (Japanese: ルイ?ジ) is Mario's younger brother in the Nintendo video games. He first appeared in Mario Bros as the second player. His role as the second player continued in Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Bros 3, and Super Mario World.   Luigi's name was inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, which was called Mario & Luigi's.   Because of software constraints of the time, Luigi initially appeared as an exact clone of Mario, except wearing green instead of red. As technology improved, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his older brother. Luigi's personality has also developed, and he is said to be more nervous and cowardly than his brother; thus, he is rarely seen.   In Super Mario Bros 2 he was one of the characters you could control, characterized by a hovering jump. This feature made him quite popular amongst fans of the games. Luigi has starred in two games, the first of which was the edutainment title, Mario is Missing, released for the Super Nintendo and PC. It was a fairly lackluster game, involving Luigi traveling throughout the world and answering questions related to famous area he was in (Japan, Russia, etc). It was not produced by Nintendo, and remains one of the few "Mario Games" created and developed entirely by an American third-party developer. His second starring role was in Luigi's Mansion, released for the Nintendo GameCube. He also co-starred in a recent game (being a substitute for Mario doesn't count as co-star) called Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, the unofficial sequel to Paper Mario in which you control both the brothers equally to save the Princess again.   In Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Luigi was kidnapped by Kamek the Magikoopa. He was freed by Yoshi after the defeat of Bowser at the Koopa Kingdom.   In the remake of Super Mario World for Game Boy Advance, Luigi is slightly more integral; you have a choice between Mario or Luigi. Luigi can jump higher and run faster, and he is designed to be the easier character to play as.   With the debut of Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64, Luigi also gained his own rival, Waluigi (Waluigi is a counterpart to Wario).   Luigi is also a hidden character in the N64 hit Super Smash Bros, and its GameCube sequel Super Smash Bros. Melee. He is a replica of Mario. His Green Missile move is an addition to Super Smash Bros. Melee. It is similar to Pikachu's Skull Bash. His taunt pose is the only taunt pose in the game that inflicts damage; it inflicts 1% damage. Unlike Mario's fireballs, Luigi's fireballs are not affected by gravity.   In the 1993 feature film Super Mario Bros., Luigi was played by John Leguizamo. In this film, Luigi's name is revealed as Luigi Mario, giving a convenient explanation as to how both Mario and Luigi can be known as the Mario Brothers.  I wish I can include one of his picture later..

      Luigi.  Mario's younger brother. Period.  That's what most people can say about him. But Luigi doesn't care.  He follow Mario around and does whatever Mario does, better or worse (usually the later one).  But the world is cruel, his popularity (???), I mean, too many spotlights on Mario, Luigi merely lives in his shadow.  Luigi is not a sad character, because no matter how much fames and fans Mario (even Wario) has steal from him, he doesn't care.  Doesn't care.  When one doesn't care anymore, one becomes invincible.  If you don't care about your lovers, how can she break your heart?  If you don't care about the result of any game, how can you really lose?  Maybe you lose, but you don't feel like losing at all, because you don't care.  Maybe Luigi does care.  And maybe as a compensation for the long forgotten Luigi, Nintendo throw him a Mansion at the dawn of GC.  But... like a big joke, that turns out to be a demo disk, shorter than any Mario games on N64 and SNES.  Poor Luigi.  However, he is still invincible.  He doesn't care.

      "Three rings for the Elven kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarven lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die.  One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne  in the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie.  One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them  in the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie."  And so it begins the great story of the Ring...  After reading "The Hobbits" (Prelude of LoR), I just couldn't wait to get start on the Real Story.  Sure, "The Hobbits" was fun and a great adventure in itself.  Yet the Ring has already played a great part in the story...  1st Chapter, which I just finished yesterday, was all about how Bilbo (The first Hobbit to own the ring) was tired up because of the queer ring and how he threw a last, 111th birthday party and left the Shire.  The movie... was quite incorrect (perhaps misleading), about how the whole story started right away after Bilbo gave the Ring to his heir, Frodo.  In the book, Frodo's adventure does not start until 17 years later, when Frodo is 50-years-old (And that's the Age when Bilbo find the ring).  Well, movies are always misleading. While reading the story, although I was trying very hard to come up with my own "picture" of the characters, but I just couldn't help to refer to the ones from the movie.  Frodo, Bilbo, Sam, Gandalf, Sauron, Elrond, Pippy, Merry, the Dwarves have all printed in my mind by the evil movie...

      The following list will order the things I'm doing recently everyday, and most likely be the topics I'll be talking about recently (In the order of amount of time spend on it):  Working (9hr/day) - Interesting somethings, but most of the time major boring and sleepy.  Reading Lord of the Ring (3hr/day) - Basically all the possible time I spend on transportation (sometimes too packed to breath, let alone reading) + the time I sit on toilet. English version, of course.  I'm not saying the Chinese version is bad (never read it actually), but I've had some pretty bad nightmares with Harry Potter.  So, if you can, original version is always encouraged to read.  You wouldn't want to read English version of 金庸 if you can read Chinese, right?  I've just finished "The Hobbits" - Prelude to "The Lord of the Ring".  It was... to be honest, better than all the Harry Potters I've read so far (that's all the Harry Potters published so far 1~5), COMBINED!  Actually, that's not a fair comparison.  While both settings are imaginary, the Middle-Earth just makes more sense to me than the Hidden-Wizard World.  After all, Mr. Tolkien's level is totally different than Ms. Rowling (or Mrs., she's divorced, right?).  He is an well-known English Professor and one of the greatest story-teller of all time, while she's just a casual -> professional writer.  But, as I've said, it's not a fair comparison - the target audiences of both books are different.  Lord of the Ring should be read by more mature audiences, I would say 15~99+. While people who are 30+ may find Harry Potter boring and doesn't make any sense here and there. Lack of structure is, in my opinion, Harry Potter's biggest flaw... I can keep going at this, but let's stop here for a sec. I'll get to my opinions on those books someday...  WarCraft III(2hr/day) - As I've mentioned before.  Like StarCraft, good games will not perish in a short period of time.  Ben, you should know what I'm talking about, take the example of Street Fighter III - 3rd Strike (How old is this game?). I'm mainly using Night Elf, {Mass Huntress}, basically these couple days fighting with Jeremy every night until 1 (when I HAVE to get to the bed).  Workout (2hr/day) - I'm still on the bet with Jeffrey, for 5000NT (that's why the 5k after my MSN Nickname), if i lose 10kg before he gain 10kg, i win 5000k and vice-versa. I find it interesting everyday how I'm so unwilling to go, but it feels really good when you get out of there, after a long and intensive workout.  Comics (3~5hr/week) - Death Notes, HunterXHunter, 死神Bleach, One Piece, Black Cat, Shamen King, LightSpeed Mask 21, Naruto... and many others...  GameCube (1hr/week) - Super Monkey Ball 2, Pokemon Co., Viewtiful Joe, Wario Inc., Soul Calibur. (I'm waiting for my SSM coming back from JOHN...)  Hang out with Friends (???hr/week) - Mostly drinking if I meet with Jeffrey, John, Jeremy. Mostly chatting and dinnering if I meet Julian. Mostly clubbing if with Jason.  Rola (???hr/week) - When she has time, I'll do my best to take out my time to fit hers.  She's another matter I'm so not sure what to do with, all I can do now is wait and see what'll happen later (later is like... 10 years?). Mostly Shopping and talking on the phone.  Basically, other than work, my life is full of Video Game, Comics, Novels, and a little love life (not even love life ba?).  That sounds horriblly like a teenager's life (other than the work part), I guess, I'm still a "Tweenager" - Teenager at their Twenties.  This Life is heading where, I don't know.  I don't want to rate it, either.  Because I believe there's no good or bad. Okay, there is, but who knows? Only Time can tell.  On a 2nd note, this life style won't last long.  It'll end by the end of July, to be exact.  And I'll be heading back to Vancouver by the end of August.  And we shall see what's waiting for me...

      Finally I have decided where this blog will heads to, after a little struggle, that is.  I think it's one of my dictinct characteristic, consciously or sub-consciously, to try to please everyone around me - even though that means I have to do something I'm unwilling to do, to some extend.  After I've read Washingtonesse's blog, I have to say, it has inspired me a lot - not about all the sex of "important" people she've had with, but about the style of her writing.  Obviously, she is having fun writing her own blog - sharing her joy and happiness and sadness for her friends who cares or who share the same interest. (And of course, she's having fun with all the sex and the luxury things she "HAS" to buy...)  I couldn't help to find out that my blog has been... a lot of... CRAPS.  Who am I kidding, I'm not a writer.  When I was writing my past articles, I have a more general audiences in mind - basically everyone I know of.  However, I think that's wrong.  This is MY diary.  This is MY life.  Whatever I'm doing, good or bad, waste time or not, stupid or smart, it shall all be noted here, if I want to.  On the other words, the goal should be to please myself, but not anyone else.  And if anyone who share the interest with me, will come back to read.  For those who don't, I don't blame you at all - for there's nothing to be blamed.  Crap or not.  This is MY diary. Period.

       為什麼人生氣時說話是用喊的?  有一天一個教授問他的學生以下的問題:  " 為什麼人生氣時說話用喊的?"  所有的學生都想了很久，其中有一個學生說:因為我們喪失了"冷靜"，所以我們會用喊的.  "但是為什麼別人就在你旁邊而已，你還是用喊的，難道不能小聲的說嗎? 為什麼總是要用喊的?"教授又問  幾乎所有的學生都七嘴八舌的說了一堆，但是沒有一個答案是讓教授滿意的，最後教授解釋說: "當兩個人在生氣的時候，心的距離是很遠的，而為了掩蓋當中的距離讓對方能夠聽見，於是必 須用喊的，但是在喊的同時人會更生氣，更生氣距離就更遠，距離更遠就又要喊更大聲........ "  教授接著繼續說: "而當兩個人在相戀時會怎麼樣呢? 情況剛好相反，不但不會用喊的，而且說話都很輕聲細語，為什麼?因為他們的心很接近，心與心之間幾乎沒有距離，所以相戀中的兩個人通常是耳語式的說話，但是心中的愛因而更深，到後來根本不需要言語，只用眼神就可以傳情，而那時心與心之間早已沒有所謂的距離了.....  最後教授做了一個結論: "當兩個人爭吵時，不要讓心的距離變遠，更不要說些讓心距離更遠的話，自然的過了幾天，等要心的距離已經比較沒有那麼遠時，再好好的說吧!!"  ---------------------------------------------------  我有試過ㄇ?  心與心的零距離?  零...

      When I wake up this morning, thanx to the dream I had, I start to hate myself.&nbsp; That's... a rare feeling...  I'm not a perfect person (and I don't know any perfect person),&nbsp; and I don't mind myself to have defect here and there.&nbsp; Sometimes I even enjoy my weaknesses, and if possible, I try to fix my problems like everyone else.  Back to the dream thing...  Probably because of the ice cream she treated me last night, I was rather moved by the ice cream (???), probably beocoz I haven't had any girl treating me so nicely since... a long time ago.  Ken was right.&nbsp; Even if I fail, I get something else invaluable in return... tho I'm still not sure what it is... or it's hard to describe in words...  Anyways, in my dream, I was fooling around with Claire...&nbsp;&nbsp;in my room back in vancouver, but the scene outside the window is still in taipei.&nbsp; And then, at some point of the fooling around process, I was going to praise her, for she looks really cute in my dream.  But then... I said my ex's name instead of hers...  She was furious to the degree that her whole body is shivering...   &nbsp; and I really really hate myself.

Pikmin or Windwaker (maybe both, same, 3~4 days) 4. 游泳 5. cut off my phone bill, health insurance and internet 6. 打包... 決定哪些要帶哪些不帶 7. 計劃東京行程吧 (i don't think akio and yuki would do it) 8. 去台中 (this is a must) 9. 看電影... (太久沒看ㄌ) 10. Finish LoR (if i have time)  先醬吧, 只有二十天, 盡力而為囉.  講起來, 好像大部分都是玩ㄉ...

And that sounds like a message from heaven and the most beautiful music from godess~~~~~~   Guess I'll slack the last two days off then ^_^   Hmm... that sounds too unresponsible... I'll try to finish my work.   I won't let him down.   Wait... was that reverse psychology???   So should I slack or not?   Eh... probably ... i don't know... depends on my mood...

(爆累ㄉ)  到公司大概九點, 小龜打電話來說大家約在松隆店, 雖然我已經快睡著ㄌ...... Neo 藍天, 辛苦你ㄌ...  到ㄌ以後... 發現人還真少. 加上我跟小龜只有五個而已.  阿... Jeremy 勒? Calvin 勒?  主角沒到... 我們不知道在爽什麼...  我到場的時候大概是九點半...  記得好像一直唱到兩點...? Jeremy 才出現... 喔, 對ㄌ, 後來 Jim 也有來...  抽到籤王的 Jeremy 看起來非常... 難過 x 100... ----------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy... 如果你有看到這段... 這邊是我無法當面講出口的話:  真的超級讓我感動, 你這麼高興收到我的多拉A夢... 說真的, 在牧場的時候我並沒有想這麼多, 只是想好好做個東西給你做紀念, 畢竟, 我也是要閃人ㄉ... 而且下次見到你真的真的不知道是什麼時候ㄌ... 你一定要好好照顧自己, 一年多會過去, 但不變的是我永遠都會記得你! 無論到時如何事過境遷, 永遠都會是挺你的好朋友! 好兄弟!  P.S. ㄟ... 我還有點自知之明... 拜託那隻多拉A夢不要放在太顯眼的地方, 那會破壞美觀....... (300% 認真) 只要能在你房間佔著一個小小的角落, 偶爾會讓你想起我們曾經一起度過的日子, 那就足夠ㄌ.  喔... 還有... 保持聯絡!!!  I will see you again!! for sure!! ----------------------------------------------------------------- 接下來... 好像是四點騎車回家... 睡到九點半...   Sunday  --------------  Typical Sunday.  Wake up, shopping with her till 9, get back home by 10:30.  Haven't saw her for almost a month now, somehow... she seems weakened a little to me... and maybe she is...  Other than appearence, everything else is just perfectly normal.  Typical typical typical sunday.  Oh, almost forgot, sunday is the D-DAY.  Claire is suppose to answer my request by today.  Although I was nervous whenever my cell makes a sound, but I didn't get her msg until 11:00 at night.  Later we talked on msn until 2:30...  To make the long story short... basically she wants me to keep going after her, she said I have super big chance if i'm not leaving.  And I can still keep going after, she can accept long distance relationship...  Err... but the thing is... I don't think I want to go thru that again.  Long distance relationship is not possible for any man.  The ones who can endure it, ought to be called superman...  honestly, that's what I think.  And so... I have no current plan for her other than just wait and see...   Monday  ------------------  The beginning of the last week.  I was at office right on time~ (Good for me, a pat at the back)  5 days left, I plan to finish up all my work before the end of wednesday...  So I'll try to talk as little as possible on msn...  Add oil~ to myself...  Vacation is waiting right around the corner~~~

      Just got home...  Well... after I&nbsp;&nbsp;(sorta) waited all day, all i got is this msg from Claire:  "I'm back, let's talk on msn when u get home"  Actually I just msned her, but no reply yet... maybe it'll be wise if i just hit bed...  Anyways, since I'm waiting here... let me summarize what happened since thursday (proposal day) while I still remember...  Here it goes...   Friday  ------------  Working at day time, of course.  Friday was pretty boring as I remembered, after work, I go straight home because Saturday I have this Company Trip and I gotta wake up by 6:00 on saturday.  Played a couple round of warcraft at home, learned that Jeremy is coming back on saturday (!!!), that's a bit of surprise, in a good way, and then I hit bed by 11.  Oh, wait, Claire phoned me from 高雄 wondering what happen to my DC, it's outta of battery all the time... Well, gets me worry about it a little as well.&nbsp; So I suggested her to get a Roll of Battery and just reload the camera whenever needed...  Seems like a useless and dumb suggestion.  Anyways, after the phone call, I went bed.   Saturday  ------------------  Wake up SUCCESSFULLY by 6:00 and left home by 6:30.  好久沒騎車到台北ㄌ... 早上騎車其實還蠻過癮ㄉ, 路上車少又沒太陽... 我的 Neo藍天號... 對ㄌ, 我幫它換過新的右後視鏡ㄌ... 這樣才不會被警察抓...  7:30 我是第一個上遊覽車的!!! 雖然領隊說要給我獎勵, 可是最後似乎忘ㄌ...  在往飛牛牧場的路上很不舒服... 不知道是不是暈車... 怪事... 超久沒暈過車ㄌ...  ........  -------------------------------- ............... grr... 要先打電動ㄌ... 明天上班有空再繼續吧...  Claire still haven't msn me yet, anyways, I plan to sleep no later then 1:30 tonight...  laters.

      OK... I have proposed.   In the least genuine and proper manner...   ------------   We spend the whole day together in a hanging out fashion. Lunch at a quiet resturant and chat till 4, then we went to bookstore for she's looking for a travel booklet to GaoHsung. She's leaving to GH on a 3 day trip with her sis, and that's why she needs a guild book to go around.   During our time in the bookstore, I offered to borrow her my dc... so we ended up in my place. And that turns out to be a really bad move...   After taught her how to use dc, we ended up sitting there doing nothing but chatting mindlessly again. And since she's on my turf... somehow I felt encouraged and suggesteds to go rent a dvd I was talking about back in the resturant. And so we did...   Just Merried - DVD  3 sandwich (Dinner)  1 bag of snack (Blue one for fitting her cloth color)  and  4 smirnoff ice (2 lime, 2 lemon)   are with us when we come back to my place.   At this point I realized that I should have proposed during lunch time, or at least during the movie.   It was a funny movie and so I ended up paying too much attention to the movie than to her... how smart can I be.   So far I have missed 2 big fat chances already.   After the movie, we were drinking... she couldn't drink a lot... probably because she's tired already or something else. "It'd be perfect timing if I say it now", I said to myself. But... the phone rang... was stupid turtle and thank him so much for cooling me down...   After that, it was around 10 already... so I send her home...   ok... three times get it all. Now I am truely the fool.   Everyone been telling me:   it's good for u.  there's nothing to lose.  wouldn't hurt if u try.  be a man and spit it out.   And I admit some part of me really want to feel love again (no... not the dirty part, morons). But as I have stated, it's such an unbelieveable bad timing. 30+ days I have left in taiwan, why do I bother?   Anyways, maybe it's the alcohol, or maybe I was too tired. Later that night, I proposed to her over MSN. I should have at least call her.   After a long silence, she said she's surprised (I don't really believe this part, because I was rather obvious. Maybe she's surprised of how stupid I am proposing over msn...) and she'd like to know when did I start to have this feeling...   I couldn't answer the question... why is that important??? Does it really matter??? So what if I start to like you 10 days ago, 100 days ago or 100 years ago???   At least to me, it seems irrelevant... But, I'm not a girl...   Since I couldn't answer right away, I msn back telling her that we better discuss this matter over the phone, and she said sure.   So I called her back.   What kinda lame answer I told her, I have nearly forgotten. I probably said I've had this feeling since our last reunion about half year ago. Yeah, that seems about right.   And after that, both of us purposely avoid to discuss back to that matter and we ended the conversation in peace...   She's going to tell me yes or no, after she come back from GH. And I really really really wish the answer&nbsp;be a big NONO.   If she said yes, I would feel so sorry for her. And I'll try my best to repay her... and that... would majorly hinder my plan of becoming a Warcraft Master... and GC Pokemon Master... (GBA Pokemon Master, I already am)...   Wants to be loved.......... that's a weird feeling I never remember I've had before.   And probably the only reason that had driven me into this mess.   --------------------------------------------   Later that night, I had a weird dream (dreams are&nbsp;mostly weird). The weirdest thing about the dream is that all my longest and best friends showed up. In the order of appearence in the dream: Young, Dean, Ken, Jeffrey...   I was taking a math exam, seems like a math final.   Young and Dean was taking the exam as well,&nbsp;they screwed me around by hiding my pencil-case (haha, haven't had one for long) and so I had a super late start.   I saw Ken was out side waiting for me. And as everyone finished up the exam, I was the last person left in the classroom still struggling with the test. (Somehow I can still remember some questions, they are really simple, but I just couldn't answer)   And&nbsp;as the whole classroom emptied out, the teacher sits impatiently in front of me (but she told me to take my time, no hurry). And that's when Jeffrey bluntly bumped into the classroom, sat beside me and the teacher, chatted with her a little, and&nbsp;left. (What the hell is he thinking and doing here anyways?)   Ken is still waiting outside and I really want to finish up the exam.   And that's when I noticed it's 8:10 in the morning already... man... I really want to finish up the dream. You know, I'm sure if I fall back to sleep, I can finish the math exam and see what's waiting for me... but... I have to come to office... damn...   Sign... life sux...   It's always so hard to reach what you really want, and sometimes when you really get there, you find out it's not any close to what you have expected.   ... cheer up ... at least I have did it..... no matter how lame it was...

      I dreamed about something really funny...   Not sure if I were in the dream or not, but it's like in one of the teenage-killing movie (Scream, I know what u did last summer.. etc.)...   I (or someone else) was in a tropical resort and that's when an Alien Shark, super smart and fast killing hunting us down one by one.   There's a scene that the whales come bumping on the shore and ask for Whale-King to help them defeat the Alien Shark... and so on...   Funny dream. Tho I was a little scared when I was IN it.   Also I've had another dream about little turtle ere I woke up, and... that makes me worry a little, I'll contact him ASAP today.

       10 Working Days Left.   &nbsp;  And, that is IF I take no more days off.&nbsp; Slacking off at the end IS my problem.&nbsp; I wonder if I can overcome this or not.  &nbsp;  Make a&nbsp;bet with&nbsp;myself, if I cannot come to office everyday for the rest 10 days, then I'll shave my head bold.  &nbsp;  Actually it's 9 days if I go 高雄 with Claire this Friday.  &nbsp;  36 Days left in Taiwan.&nbsp; And now I'm going after this girl.&nbsp; That seems not very logical.&nbsp; As usual, there are no means to justify my action because I can't justify my action.  &nbsp;  If everything goes well, my blog will become Love Log soon.&nbsp; However, it won't last.  &nbsp;  And everything won't go well, I presume.&nbsp; I've talked with her on phone for 2 hours yesterday, and already I feel tired --> this is such a waste of time and effort.&nbsp; I'm not saying going after girls is waste of time, but going after a girl that'll be parted soon is, a waste of time.  &nbsp;  And at the end (if everything goes well), I'll just hurt her and hurt myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So why am I still doing it? &nbsp; ........... ....... ... &nbsp; Because I'm lonely, I guess.  &nbsp;  Last Friday I was joking with my ex-gf that I'm going after her again.&nbsp; And she replied firmly that she got a bf already and I should quit wasting my time anymore. &nbsp; And that was the moment I felt the lonest ever since she left me. &nbsp;  Love is the cure for loneliness, therefore, I'm seeking a cure.  &nbsp;  There, I have probably justified my action... &nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, I'm rather sick and tired of the whole "slowly-getting-to-know-each-other" process.&nbsp; That's why I felt tired after just spend 2 hours on the phone with her.&nbsp; We could have speak longer, if I didn't quit.   Speaking of the phone call... I have to admit that the things we've talked about was relatively interesting.&nbsp; It could be super obviously already that I want to go after her, ergo, our conversation was mainly focus on what each other thinks of relationship, marriage, kids and future... &nbsp; So all these weird questions like: &nbsp; "Would you look down a&nbsp;girl if she goes after you?" "Would you mind if your wife's salary is higher than you?" &nbsp; Somehow, it seems to me that she wants to take it slowly, step by step. Seriously, I don't mind, and I think it ought to be fun at this point, ere we become a couple. &nbsp;  But the problem is:&nbsp; Time, I DON'T HAVE. &nbsp; And&nbsp;she knows this as well as I do. &nbsp; This problem makes the whole going after process rather awkward and unnatural. &nbsp; So......................................... I decided to speed things up a little.  &nbsp;  Success or fail, I don't really mind.  &nbsp;  Tonight is supposely our first informal date (going out alone).&nbsp; We are going to watch Spider Man 2 (what a romantic movie).&nbsp; And  I'll propose. &nbsp;  Let me rewind a little....&nbsp;  She asked me to go 高雄 on a 3 day trip this Friday.&nbsp; I don't really want to go because her sister is tagging alone.&nbsp; Not that I do mind about her sister, it's just that I don't like going out with odd number of people because 1 will doom to feel left out at some point, especially when you guys don't know each other THAT well.  &nbsp;  Plus, I have a company trip to attend this Saturday.&nbsp; Going 高雄 is rather troublesome for me. &nbsp;  Plus, haven't I just decided that I'll come to office everyday for the rest 10 days???  &nbsp;  Well... if she or her sister find another person to come alone, I might think about it again.&nbsp; After all, I am going after her.&nbsp; &nbsp;  ... back to the proposal part.  &nbsp;  Here's my plan for today:  &nbsp;  - 6:30&nbsp;Dinner&nbsp;at Burger King  - 7:40 Spider Man 2  - 11:00 Coffe Shop in 樹林  - 11:30 Propose  &nbsp;  Seems like a perfect plan~&nbsp; I'm especially fond of the Burger King part.  &nbsp;  ...  &nbsp;  Anyways, I'll c... it seems like a pretty screw-up plan at this point.  &nbsp;  I want to spend some time to describe Claire in detail, but I'll do that if I have time in the afternoon.  &nbsp;  If I didn't do it in the afternoon, and if I didn't success tonight, the reason to do it may not exist anymore.  &nbsp;  That's... that for now, I'll think harder later...

      Haven't had a long and meaningful blog since forever... (all my blogs are meaningless, that's the feedback i'm getting)...  Anyways... technically, I'm very much look alike going after this girl... (since all my friends told me to do so, regardless i only have 40 days left in taiwan... good friends...) but it's still undeniable that i'm still under the affection of my ex-gf...  This is so unfair.  [today is so hot]  If I fail, I have wasted my precious time.  Even worse, if I succeed, we'll still be apart in about an month.  Well.. but since I have choose to 耍寶, I'll keep 耍寶 till the end, i think.

       找到的感動   Anyone whose been hanging out shopping with me ought to know, I was looking for this DVD for so long.  And thank goodness I had never give up!  The DVD's title is "Man of Honour", a rather old movie.  I been looking it EVERYWHERE!  All the major stores that sells DVD around Taipei Train Station, around SOGO/統領, in 士林夜市, 基隆夜市, and all the video stores in my hometown, 樹林.  Alas, my search was in vain.  Did I forgot to mention the reason?  It was nothing serious, just doing a favour for someone who is/was very important to me...  Luck always appears at the most unexpected moment.  Today I was circling around 內湖... (for some not so bright reason)...  And around noon, I was hungry for I haven't been eating for 16 hours already (on diet).  So I decided to go to this spaghetti place I've been to once before.  But unfortunately, it was not open...  Since I'm still on diet, I don't want to eat anything big, so I changed my mind and decided to go to 7-11 and grab some light-lunchbox.  Anyone who lives in Taiwan shall be as least familiar with the process.  You grab a lunch box off the shelf, pay at the counter and wait for the cashier to microwave your lunch box.  Nothing special.  So I was waiting for the lunch box to be microwaved and so I was looking around, browsing the store. There I noticed a small busket beside the counter with lots of DVDs on sale.  "Well...... what the hell...", I thought.  And so I was reviewed each DVD's title, because the busket was messy and unorganized, it's easy to look over any DVD.  And ... I couldn't believe my eyes when I have found it.  "It's a miracle!!!", I almost shouted out.  Well, I did shouted out inside my heart. ^_^  But there are cashiers and other customers around me, so I have to act cool.  Realized that I didn't have enough money with me, I ran out to my scooter (forgot my lunchbox) and rode to the closest ATM I can find.  When I was back to the 7-11, the cashier looked at me with two query eyes.  Well, I was too happy at that moment so I explained to her how long I've been seraching for this DVD...  And FINALLY...  GOT IT!!  MAN OF HONOUR, 入手! ^_^

      This very morning, Asia-Pacific Japan's new Leader Ottosan (sounds like this), has arrived to our Taipei office and gave out a quick speech concerning what's HP's strategy in the next half fiscal year...  Eh... the thing is... at the end of his speech, there was a time left for open question.  As a habit, my fellow Taiwan co-workers were all reluctant to ask anything ere forced by.  I had a couple rather good question in mind... but for some reason, I had not the courage to spit them out...  I can probably think of 10 execuses to that, but still, execuses are ... only execuses, they won't change the outcome.  It's not that I want to show off or anything, but somehow I feel regretful and uneasy for not have the guts to stand up.  Just... stand up...

      昨天跟朋友的未婚妻在聊天...  很有趣的對話, 因為她一直搞不清楚拉斯維加斯跟阿拉斯加有什麼不一樣...  我解釋了好久才講清楚.  其實這也沒什麼, 那兩個名字本來就蠻像的, 我剛回來也一直搞不清楚 "桃園/花蓮", "新莊/新店", "土城/木柵" ...  另外...  她似乎認為加拿大... 並不大... 或許比較沒有 "省" 跟 "州" 的概念...  加拿大每個省都比台灣大多ㄌ, 不過從對話裡感覺的出來她好像覺得加拿大跟台灣大小差不多...  這其實也沒什麼, 如果不去看地圖的話我也搞不清楚希臘跟西班牙哪個比較大, 反正感覺起來都差不多.  最後, 我們對話快結束的時候... 她突然冒出一句...  "台灣二月是加拿大幾月ㄚ?"  "..."  "時差考慮進去的話... 可能有幾個小時是加拿大的一月..."  其實如果我回答她... "台灣二月是加拿大八月左右, 不知道她會不會相信..."  (當然, 她應該指的是季節, 不過問法也太奇怪ㄌ吧? - 就算完全沒有地理概念, 也應該問說 - 台灣春天是加拿大什麼季節吧?)  ... 恩 ... 沒有要嘲笑她的意思... 只是... 當時我實在覺得很好笑...

But comepare to asking a girl out to movie, I'd rather stay at home play video game; hang out with friend drinking; reading comics or novels on bed... those are the things I do...  I never go out alone with any girls... excluding Her...  That's... something I don't understand.

      My back hurts......  Yesterday came the most incredible lighting strom shower I have ever seen.  Blazing thunder lightening the night sky while huge rain drops falling like crazy...  Anyways, it was jaw-dropping.  However, I had neither the time nor relaxing mind to enjoy the amazing storm, because around 23:30, I found that the water has already filled the balcony and almost flooding into my place...  So as the weariness blinded my mind, I grabbed the towel from washroom, left it besides the door, and ran into the stormy balcony with only a mobbing bucket and my underwear.  When I have reached the balcony, I was all soaked and cold.  But the coldness has soon disappeared because I tried very hard to keeping filling up the bucket and pouring the water to street.  After working like a madman for about 10 min, my back hurts, my arms are shaking and I can barely stand the rain anymore.  Even worse, I realized that my bucket strategy wasn't helping at all!!  The bucket was big, and the water I can fill up each time were at least more than 2 Liter.  2L per 10 sec.  Each minute I can remove 12L of water and within that 10 Min. I have at least removed 120L.  But it was useless, the water was still full to the brim and ready to pouring into my place anytime...  I may have only slowed the process...  And that was when I finally start to think.  Even if the bucket works, if the rain don't stop, how long can I stand there in the rain working like this? I couldn't have last 20 ... at most 30 min.  I need to let the water drain itself.  But it was too dark and I couldn't see a thing.  So there I was touching every corner of the balcony and feel with my hand.  With the help of random lighting, I found a big hole, or a small tunnel, against the wall, leading the water to the other side of the room.  I couldn't tell if the water were running out of the hole or coming from the hole, but either way, i have to clear it.  But as I put my hands and arms into the tunnel, it was NOT blocked, which means the water have filled the other side as well!!  The other side of the wall is another bigger balcony, at least 3 times bigger. If I don't find and hopefully clear the outfall, water will fill up my apartment and I'll be living in water world the next day when I wake up...  Running to the other side, and quickly I started searching for the scupper.  Luckily, I found it lay right beside the tunnel which connects to the smaller balcony.  And it was choked with leaf, mud and garbage.  I was rather angry at that moment and throw out everything I could find on top of the outfall and toss them off the street as far as I could.  After about 30 sec, I can feel water running into the outfall with my hands as it makes a HAPPY water-draining sound ^_^.  Later I sit there for about 5 more mins to make sure it's not blocked again by other things and until the water has faded...  Finally, Jeffrey (the stupid ass) has saved the night...

      反正都講電話講到早上五點ㄌ... 乾脆把該做的事一併處理...  本來是想等到照片出來再動筆的, 不過想想還是趁記憶尚未退色之前, 趕快把這次瘋狂的假期紀錄下來.  五年, 十年以後如果能再看到, 應該會很感動吧. 照片, 就之後再補吧.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  8/6 星期五, 晴  忘了星期四在幹麻了, 反正星期五睡到快中午. 起床以後跟小龜 MSN 幾句, 就跑出去匯錢給旅社 (2000). 另外也買了本墾丁功略 (88) ... 打算下午好好計畫接下來兩天的行程. 回家以後壞消息接踵而至, 先是最舒服的遊覽車 "阿囉哈" 已完全售罄 (這個字怎麼唸?), 然後就是綈娜唉唉叫說這次都沒有女生去... 後面那件事我雖然一點忙也幫不上, 不過還是安慰了她兩句, 講什麼倒也不是記得很清楚, 反正最後還是讓她自己決定囉. 畢竟, 如果我一個男生要跟四個女生出去玩, 我大概也會考慮好一陣子吧...? (... 算ㄌ, 吐自己槽還蠻蠢的).  行程大略排出來之後 (好像有寫在之前的日記中), 我又跑出去匯款給車行 (2000). 跟大家約十一點在台北車站北門對面的停車場見面, 我一直摸到晚上九點還在看 Jojo..., 因為我已經看好火車時刻表, 所以不用等車, 東摸西摸依依不捨的又加了兩個 Blog 到十點半才出門. 出門前有打給她啦, 不過她好像心情不是很好, 我... 不知道有沒有受到影響, 多多少少一點點吧...? 這是題外話, 暫且表過.  忘了我在火車上幹什麼傻事, 多半是打電動吧? (想起來了, 我在火車上傳簡訊回去給她...) 跑了一整天, 大概頭也暈暈的, 如果不打電動可能醒來又到松山去ㄌ (我是真的有醬想). 還好, 台北車站我還有記得下車.  到約定地點後就開始罵人了, 每次跟這些混蛋約都要遲到是怎樣? 我已經遲到十五分鐘了, 還一個人影都沒看到. 無奈. 只好坐在停車場外的矮鐵架上打手機裡的無聊電動. 打打打到十一點半終於小龜打電話過來, 正要開罵卻被反罵回來, 說他們早就在客運站前面等我, 見鬼了, 他們這次竟然準時到, 還等我. 奇妙~~~  遇到小龜還說想我到的時候會打電話給他們, 最好是, 你們紀錄這麼差, 我肯定是想說我最先到的, 哪會打去問你們到了沒阿, 多半是在騎車吧 (當時我是醬想啦).  遇到凱文, tina, 小龜的時候他們正大包小包的坐在路邊攤, 桌上屍橫片野告訴我他們已經都吃過宵夜ㄌ, 坐下剛開始跟小龜哈啦, 凱文跟 tina 就跑去買飲料ㄌ. 記得我點了個粽子 (30), 裡面的餡還真少.  8/7 星期六, 晴偶雨  吃完粽子後, 小龜開始唉唉叫說他的背又在痛了, 只好跑到康是美 (這名字還真土) 買膏藥來貼. 我好像也順手買了相機用的電池 (120), 因為充電電池忘記充電, 還是買了保險一點.  上統聯客運 (~400) 的時候約莫是零點十分吧, 我跟小龜坐在靠後門最近的位置, 凱文 tina 則坐在我們後面. 本來是要打 gba 的, 結果車子一發動燈就都熄ㄌ, 實在應該帶 gba-sp 來的... 氣死我...  在車上搖搖晃晃, 很想聊天, 可是想到今天還有一整天要過, 只好強迫自己睡覺. 座位是不小, 可是實在很不符合人體工學, 設計這些座位的實在該砍頭, 躺也不是, 縮起來也不是, 腳也沒辦法伸直. tina 比較小隻, 又上了一天班, 倒是很快就睡著ㄌ, 我大概在上面翻滾了半個小時才睡著, 中間還不斷的起來翻滾, 快變成多爾滾... (恩, 很冷). 聽說小龜跟凱文在車上完全沒睡. 不知道是我應該佩服他們還是他們應該佩服我... 總之, 到高雄火車站的時候已經四點多ㄌ, 比預計時間還早大概一兩個小時.  說是送到高雄火車站, 其實也沒有, 大概還隔了兩條街左右. 找到火車站以後我們就不知道要怎麼辦了. 因為糯米要到八點才出現, 小龜跟凱文又都沒睡, 實在很想找各地方休息一下. 跑去 7-11 一問發現令人訝異的事實, 堂堂高雄火車站附近竟然一間網咖跟 KTV (這些是我們先想到的地方) 都沒有. 這是什麼鳥地方? 我還以為台灣網咖跟屁一樣多, 結果竟然附近走的到的地方一間也沒有.  最後我們只好往 24 小時的咖啡廳跑. 雖然沒有網咖, 不過看到咖啡廳的價目表還是讓我嚇一跳. 雖然不怎麼高級, 不過大概也快要有台北 Starbucks 等級的咖啡廳, 裡面賣的東西竟然價格不到台北一半... 台北的咖啡真是值錢..., 還好我不太喝咖啡.  大概是五層樓的咖啡廳吧, 躲到這裡等天亮的人還真不少, 我們從二樓走到四樓竟然高朋滿座, 都找不到四個人的座位 (兩人座倒還有), 晚上四點半耶, 你們全都不用睡覺是怎樣? 爬到五樓, 又是另一種景象... 一個人都沒有, 而且所有椅子都倒放在桌上, 看起來就像是在清掃的樣. 不過燈光充足, 冷氣音樂也都開著, 我就很白爛的自動把椅子拉到地上, 讓大家坐下來休息... 當然, 沒坐多久 (大概三十分鐘), 就被服務生趕到樓下去了. 他應該蠻驚訝的吧, 怎麼會有這麼莫名其妙的客人...  凱文應該是蠻累的, 只要一坐下, 他的頭就會掉到桌上, 然後就沒聲音了. 神奇的小龜竟然還沒睡, 還陪我跟 tina 玩牌. 一開始玩 Big 2, 後來變成 99 真心話大冒險, 不知道為什麼小龜跟我狂輸, 一直被套一些很私人的問題出來, 我們講話又很大聲, 最後不但凱文都被吵醒加入, 連隔壁桌的都在偷聽我們講話. 基本上這間店禁止玩牌, 不過不知道為什麼沒人來阻止我們, 大概是對話太有趣ㄌ...  好不容易熬到八點糯米終於打電話來, 約我們在高雄火車站的麥當勞見面. 又等了他大概半個小時才出現, 他真是迷路大王. 我吃的好像是蛋堡 (20) 跟薯餅 (20).  本來是要作客運下去, 在車上可以補眠, 可是高雄火車站的運將完全不放過我們, 一個接一個來問, 最後我們坐上一部 11 人座的小客車 (250) 直衝墾丁~~~ 在車上還是沒辦法好好睡, 睡著的好像只有 tina 跟凱文, 小龜在前面一直跟糯米打屁, 我坐在後座... 倒是睡不著... 兩個人壓在我身上大概多少有點關聯...  又過大約一個半小時, 客車就停在我們訂好的金城別館附近, 那時才十點多而已, 進去一問, 竟然要 12 點才能讓我們 Check-in, 不過行李可以先借放倒是省下點麻煩. 後來才知道, 墾丁每間旅館幾乎都是萬能的, 都能住, 租車, 安排水上行程... 像我們這樣住一間, 租車一間, 水上行程又另一間的大概多少還是有點浪費時間.  走到租車店, 本來是跟他訂 50cc 兩部, 125cc 兩部, 可是沒駕照的凱文跟糯米堅持要騎 125, 沒辦法, 最後只好牽走四部 125.  離 Check in 還有一個半小時, 行程稍微有點亂掉 (原以為一到就可以 Check in), 結果只好騎車到處晃晃. 先到 7-11 讓糯米嗑個便當, 順便我們幾個也灌下五隻啤酒 (之後好像去哪裡之前都先灌幾隻才走... 原因不明). 後來不知道誰提議 (大概是我), 我們就騎車到南灣去看看情況, 想說反正晃一下就回來了. 喝完酒, 外面又熱, 我們四個男生就把衣服全脫ㄌ, 反正沒人認識我們~~~ 到南灣途中糯米還搞失蹤, 他真的... 少一跟筋... 害我們頂著艷陽等了他大概十分鐘左右 (可能不只).  南灣... 不是一個美字可以形容. 海天一色, 浪花滔滔, 乾淨的海灘讓我們啤酒罐也都不好意思亂丟. 印象中已經好久好久沒來過這麼像海灘的海灘了. 本來只是要走走, 因為時間無多, 結果幾個男生還是開始瞎起鬨, 摔來摔去最後全都摔到海裡面, 當然, 衣服褲子也全都濕ㄌ... 濕掉的衣服問題並不大, 炎熱的陽光五分鐘左右就可以搞定這個問題, 比較麻煩是身上的砂礫跟?, 還是非得沖水才能洗乾淨. 其實在南灣沒玩多久, 是我們自己找麻煩, 根本不應該入水的, 不過, 哈哈, 爽就好~~  話說回來, 因為之後就要去浮潛, 所以回到旅社其實也不用沖澡的, 不過我們幾個不知道在想什麼, 還是輪流洗澡完才出門. 負責我們浮潛的旅店叫海中天, 地圖上看起來很遠, 其實就在我們旅社對面而已. 本來連騎水上摩托車 850, 結果老闆跟我們說摩托車不好玩, 叫我們玩快艇, 香蕉船跟浮潛就好 (~450).  浮潛那套衣服還真是... 穿起來有夠熱的, 恨不得自己馬上泡在水裡. 汗如雨下的滋味真的很難受, 快要脫水ㄌ. 大概是我比較沒有 Sense 吧, 浮潛跟我想像中差好多... 我還以為是可以潛下去一點... 然後用的是可以過濾空氣的吸管... (果然想太多) ...  雖然跟本人幻想有出入, 不過, 還是漂亮的沒話講, 閃耀著透入海面搖擺不定日光的珊瑚礁, 穿梭其間五顏六色, 大大小小的魚群. 剛開始一看到魚還會緊張的叫前後的人看, 後來發現根本目不暇給. 自己看都快要沒時間, 那種感覺很有趣, 就像平常只能在電視上 (都市兒童...) 看到的景象突然擺在你眼前, 而且伸手可及. 超感動的~~~~~~  快艇根本是騙人的, 只是坐在一艘拉著香蕉船的快艇罷ㄌ, 並沒有什麼特別的. 倒是香蕉船, 如果能多坐兩次, 應該還蠻好玩ㄉ. 說是香蕉船, 其實叫香腸熱狗船會更像一點. 就是一條熱狗形狀的氣墊船, 上面有六條讓乘客拉住的橡皮, 六個人排成一列跨坐在上面以後, 前面的快艇就開始拉船, 拉幾圈以後快艇就會大轉彎把上面的乘客摔下來.  好玩的地方是, 我們就是不讓他摔. 第一次坐還沒經驗就算ㄌ, 轉兩個彎就不頂ㄌ. 第二次上去倒是撐ㄌ很久, 從頭到尾就聽到坐最前面的糯米一直喊, 左邊左邊, 右邊右邊!!!! 後來船長 (or whatever), 用大絕招, 來個連續 S 型的大轉彎才把我們翻下去. 假動作... 太... cheap 了~~~  跳下船後繼續浮潛, 這次自己游就更有趣ㄌ, 幾乎都是追著魚在跑. 這麼美麗的海洋... 除了感動以外, 還是感動... 直到上岸以後小龜還一直吵要回去, 一直吵到第二天早上為止, 吵死ㄌ.  回到旅館, 休息, 又洗澡, 我總共才帶三套衣服, 已經剩一套了... 躺ㄌ半天, 實在已經很累了, 可是今天才過一半而已~~~~~~~ 下一站是小灣. 小灣就沒有南灣那麼有趣ㄌ, 沙灘石頭都比較硬, 風景也略遜了點, 我們主要是去找 Jason 的朋友, 好像有 Shawn, Eric.. 還有其他... 打招呼的成分居多吧, 大部分也都是我們自己在玩. 在小灣最難忘的, 就是下了一場太陽雨, 看著無數雨滴落在海面, 隨著浪潮起伏, 不是三言兩語能形容的...  一直玩到天黑被趕上岸為止.  本來是要直接回旅館再洗一次澡, 不過凱文還是糯米被旅館對面的牛排店香味吸過去, 最後一人吃ㄌ一份厚片牛排 (130), 才乖乖回旅館換衣服. 先回去的是 Tina 跟凱文, 我跟小龜糯米則是趁他們先洗的時候去買ㄌ烤魷魚 (80 x 2) 跟啤酒...  休息ㄌ大概一個小時, 再出發去墾丁路掃街. 其實大概就是一直吃吃吃, 吃完芒果冰 (80) 再吃魚蛋 (30), 然後玩射飛鏢, 晃來晃去~~~ 小龜瞄準一隻蜘蛛人的布娃娃, 結果竟然很賽的射中蜘蛛人上面的 Winnie the Poo...  大概逛ㄌ一下, 其實大家也都吃不下ㄌ, 我們就前往夜遊的第一個地點, 鵝鸞鼻. 騎車過去大概十五分鐘吧. 沿路又買ㄌ啤酒跟金剛仙女棒... 台灣最南端的燈塔, 海風跟星光, 真是下酒的好料. 坐在燈塔下, 除了偶爾閃過的塔光, 就是一整片灑下的星光. 躺在那裡看著似乎伸手可及的星星, 數著一顆顆消逝的流星... 有如夢境般的夜晚... (如果沒有蚊子咬的我滿手滿腳的話...)  8/8 星期日, 晴  回到旅社, 又吃了東山雞頭 (200), 烤小鳥 (80 x 2) 跟椰子汁 (50 x 2). 除了椰子以外, 其他都超好吃的. 下一站是東門出火... 這是我堅持要去的地方.  我想像中... 是一片荒無的土地上有無數大大小小的石塊, 然後石塊中會有火光飄來飄去.... 結果... 我們看到的是一圈用木杵圍成大概一個水池大小的土地, 然後火真的不斷從石縫中燒出來. 雖然小了點, 不過騎了快二十分鐘的車還是蠻值得的. 小龜看到火就整個人 High 起來, 也不知道是怎樣, 一直在火圈裡面耍寶. 一下用火點煙, 一下把要烤來吃的爆米花整盤摔出去. 最後還跳火. 笑死我們ㄌ. 說真的, 那還真是奇景, 為什麼其他地方都沒有看過ㄋ???  終於回到旅館, 晚上兩點半. 大家都差不多動不了了... 糯米一倒下去就睡, 平常正常作息習慣ㄌ, 能撐到兩點還真難為他ㄌ. 當然, 我們還是不會放過他, 麥克筆馬上拿出來就開始在他身上簽名照相 ^_^. 等照片出來我再貼上去~~~  第二天大概是睡到八九點吧, 眼睛一張開就看見糯米來勢洶洶, 拿著麥克筆向我走來, 小龜在我旁邊已經被畫的很可愛ㄌ ^_^ 乳頭上被畫了火影的符號, 他自己看了三次才發現, 超爆笑ㄉ~~~  鬧ㄌ一個早上, 決定要去海洋博物館浪費掉最後半天 (糯米兩點就應該閃ㄌ). 十點 Check out, 吃完早餐後, 我們就騎車直衝海洋博物館. 結果, 不知道是衝太快還是怎樣, 在某路口找路的時候, 糯米竟然發現他的手機不見啦!!!  沒辦法, 我們只好沿路找回去. 頂著 36 度的艷陽, 慢慢的騎車逆向找手機還真是個難得的經驗. 倒著騎ㄌ大概五到十公里, 都已經快放棄ㄌ. 本來嘛, 手機從時速五六十以上的機車上掉下來, 還能完整無缺找到的機會有多少? 我們也只是盡力而已.  說真的, 如果掉的是我的手機, 可能早就放棄ㄌ.  不過ㄋ, 哈哈哈, 真應該讓我媽看看那天我的表現, 她老是罵我要找什麼都找不到. 當我們到最後十字路口分頭找手機的時候, 就這麼賽給我找到了~~~~~~~ 當時可是高興的連機車都來不及停, 摔到一邊就跳下車把手機抓起來!!! 然後在路邊大吼大叫, 還好沒有人聽到 ^_^ 用手機把大家叫回來, 真是我今年作過最光榮的一件事. 受不了~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  這樣折騰了一翻, 海博館也不用去ㄌ, 最後決定再回到我們剛到墾丁看過最美麗, 卻沒有好好玩的南灣再去給她回味一下. 南灣... 仍然是一樣的美麗. 這次有準備就租ㄌ陽傘 (200), 然後下水摔角, 沖浪, 騎馬打仗, 一直玩到下午一點半. 肩膀跟臉就是這時候曬傷ㄉ... 現在還在痛... 快樂, 是要付出代價ㄉ.  最後發生一些鳥事, 糯米訂的車竟然跟我們說冷氣壞掉ㄌ, 拜託, 三十幾度耶, 冷氣壞掉半價我們也不願意坐. 後來拖拖拉拉臨時找了一台 March (250), 才五個人擠一台車三點多衝回高雄. 等車的時候又買ㄌ雞肉飯 (50).  假期到這個時候也接近尾聲ㄌ, 該玩的雖然沒有全部玩到, 不過, 這次還真的是因為都跟很好的朋友去, 才能好玩到這樣. 這是... 無可取代的...  在回程上, 糯米話很少... 又不捨ㄌ吧... 大家也都一樣.  最後一件鳥事, 就是在高雄火車站被騙說什麼尊龍 (600) 跟阿囉哈一樣好, 結果坐上去還是什麼東西都壞掉. 本來預計十二點以前到台北火車站我還可以趕末班車回來, 結果到新莊已經快一點ㄌ. 最後我是在新莊下車, 坐小黃回家ㄉ...  終於... 天下沒有不散的筵席... 就這樣, 墾丁剩下美好的回憶, 在我們所有人的心中.  ----------------------------------------------------  後記: 糯米在高雄車站離開後還打電話回來跟我們說謝謝. 當時第一個反應就是 "謝屁阿". 不過, 現在我也要跟大家說謝謝. 尤其是小龜... 如果不是他大力半強迫的拉我出去, 照我的個性可能也是懶的動, 在家裡躺過兩天吧. 可以了解糯米的心情... 謝謝大家, 糯米, 凱文, Tina, 跟小龜... 這是我回台灣一年多玩的最最過癮的一次. 也真的好久沒這麼開心ㄌ. 謝謝大家......

      說起來, 放假以後倒也比較沒有時間想東想西的.  上班的時候腦袋空空, 就比較容易胡思亂想.  至少, 上下班通車 3 小時的時間就夠我想一大堆有的沒的了.  昨晚有人特地留了地瓜給我吃... 謝謝...  週末要去墾丁, 其實就這樣突然下去, 還蠻有意思的.  下午我會好好的計畫行程, 現在應該先去吃點東西吧...?  Getting Excited!

      好餓喔..  放假第四天, 一早醒來跟已經約三四個禮拜的同學去錢櫃唱歌.  不知不覺四個小時就過去了.  回到家下午三點.  鬼混到五點, 睡到七點.  水喔.  聽說糯米明天有可能回來. 真好. 這是今天到此為止發生最好的事情. 即使僅是有可能而已.  她說墾丁 Ok. 應該是下週末會去吧. 看起來.  最近老是在讀一些難過的書, 聽一些難過的歌, 作一些難過的事.  什麼時候可以, 逃走呢?  -------------------  愛是很簡單的  難的是  要把它留住

      放假第三天~  果然, 坐在電腦前的時間跟 blog 的數量是成正比的...  昨天小龜跑來 Party... ㄟ... 反正就是一樣的事情, Soul Calibur, 數字拳... 十二支...  ...  今天下午竟然跟小龜 + 凱文跑到大湖公園去游泳, 還蠻神ㄉ... 不過那間真的蠻便宜的, 下次想不開還可以再來去走走~  發現我每天很難跟著計畫走 (還是不要計畫算ㄌ).  本來今天是要跟 Claire 去看電影, 結果 Claire 不舒服, 所以... 就變成游泳... (會不會差太多)  游泳完吃蒸餃, 吃完正在想要怎麼回家, 她就打來, 人在 ATT, 剛好凱文要載我到國父紀念館, 下車以後我就走過去找她.  She's still as stunningly beautiful as always...... oh, well...  Take her home, after shopping.  For some reason, she seems tired.  And no motivation to shop,... that's a first.......  Then I asked Jamie to pick me up and take me home, for that I have to hand him daphy's notebook.  That's probably the longest I've ever talk to Jamie...  By the way, don't buy any new BMW or Mercedes in Taiwan.  They are fake...  That's... what I've learned from him today...  Taiwan dealer always (eh... or sometimes), buy 2nd-hand cars and they fix the dashboard and repair the car to make it look like new, and then sell it like new (of course).  That's... well... that's that...  其實在台灣買的起那些新車的人也不在乎一點修車的冤枉錢吧, 這倒是另一件事ㄌ.  總之, 今天雖然好累好累, 卻是很充實的一天~  (每天都繼續這樣充實下去吧~~~)  p.s. 小龜的網路還沒修好~

      This... shall be my last blog done at my office (where I did most of my previous blogs).  I started my blog at this very desk.  And so far, probably 95% of my blogs are from this desk as well.  I've chatted with so many people from here.  I'll miss this beautiful 19" HP OEM Monitor...  Well... that's the end.  Nothing worthwhile to celebrate.  This serves merely as the last of my footprint at HP, for now, or forever.  Goodbye, HP.

      勉強算是放假第一天  仔細看看剩下的日子並不多ㄌ, 要好好把握時間.  讓我看看今天到現在為止幹了什麼好事:    10:00~10:30 媽媽叫我起床, 很驚訝為什麼沒去上班, 跟她解釋了半天    10:30~3:00 看漫畫, 上 msn 打屁    3:00~5:00 出去吃滷肉飯, 油雞飯, 牛肉湯麵, 買我妹的電腦包包, 花ㄌ一千五買到一個爛包包... (sorry daphne)  充實的一天  晚上要幹麻ㄋ?

      還沒睡著  已經下午三點... 過去 27 個小時我只睡了一個多小時.  今天本來是不應該哭的, 以為我們已經都儘量避開這種感傷的話題, 結果最後在天成飯店門口, 開往台南的接駁客運前, 來往的人群中, 還沒說再見, 淚水就已很不爭氣的出來ㄌ.  (現在邊寫都還在邊掉淚是怎樣?)  最後並沒有說太多話, 該補充的, 已經沒有了.  前天晚上最誇張的應該也是我們三個. 其實還真沒禮貌, 在一群熟跟不熟跟第一次見面的朋友前, 三個就打成一團了.  打打哭哭停停.  並不是被打到哭的, 因為不管捶的再大力, 最痛的還是... 心裡  (已經放棄阻止眼淚了)  並不是生離死別阿    只是, 未來誰能預料? 誰知道我下次回來的時候, 又會怎麼樣?  (自己坐在這裡哭的希哩花拉還蠻蠢的)  好難過, 好難過  自己都不知道在難過什麼  也不過就是一個能一起幹蠢事, 能交心, 能談天說地, 能信賴, 能兩個人喝酒喝到吐, 能一起哭, 能一起笑, 能一起難過, 能一起快樂, 能一起... 的朋友離開了.  (幹!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 我真的不想再哭ㄌ, 哭給誰看阿!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  但這種朋友, 一輩子, 又能遇到幾個?  一個都嫌多了吧??  真的  一個都太多了...    昨天我們三個互相嗆聲了整晚, 想說或許離開的時候會比較不感傷 (媽的你們把我罵的一無是處是怎樣?)... 結果並沒有幫助......  Jeremy 在車上揮手趕我們走的時候, 真的有衝動要衝上車再捶他兩拳.  轉頭走沒幾步, 猶豫了一下, 想說再回去看他一眼也好. 還好. 他把窗簾拉上了.  後來死龜頭又說了一些話, 內容我已經不太記得, 只知道十幾天後我可能要有斷手斷腳的覺悟...    好感謝. 我回台灣的時間並不長. 或許我離開很久很久以後, 唯一會掛念的, 就只有你們了.  我不知道. 這麼多, 這麼重的友情, 我扛不扛的下來, 我還不還的起.  (哭死算ㄌ, 跟她分手大概都沒哭這麼久)    拖著蹣跚的腳步, 走進熟悉的台北車站. 收到 Jeremy 的簡訊 "...你一定要他媽的給我死回來".  說真的, 我沒辦法保證, 未來的事太難預料. 昨天在看龜頭電腦裡去年的照片 (都沒有我就是了, 死龜), 真的感觸很多. 一年前, 有誰會想到?  時間真的是很奇妙的東西  它不能改變的只有一件事, 這是我唯一能保證的一件事, 不管未來怎樣, 我永遠永遠不會忘記你們, 不會忘記 Jeremy, 小龜, 凱文, John, Jim, Michael........ 得失憶症不在此限. (哭完開始搞笑了)    在月台等火車的時候 (快寫完了, 忍耐一下), 很習慣的打電話給她, 分手這麼久, 我還是在某種程度上蠻依賴她的. She's more realistic, I knew I would feel much better after I talk to her.  其實真的沒必要搞到這樣, 搞到這麼難過. 真的, 又不是說要死了還是怎樣. 只要地球還是圓的, 以後總有再見面的機會.  只是, 人就活這麼一次, 也不過就是一輩子.  我願意, 高興就大聲的笑, 難過就用力的哭.  隱藏自己的保護色呢? 在外人面前戴的面具呢? 這些東西, 在朋友間太多餘了.  (下午四點, 該睡了嗎?)
