      Hey!!! Tonight kids, I saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! Listen to me, you should all go see it.  I'm serious, it's so good.  Taylor says hi.  She accomponied me to see the film, let me tell you shes trouble to take out.  First of all, we get there early and she's all, "Lets go to dunkin donuts" For those of you who don't look outside, it was raining.  But I'm a nice kid so I went.  But on the way we encountered the puddle, the best way to describe this puddle would be to say it was about the same size as the atlantic ocean.  I didn't want to cross this puddle and in order to avoid it, and Taylor, I ran into Griebs pharmacy, where some serious funny business ensued.  Taylor chased me around the store, then yelled at me saying that we were acting like a couple, then she announced that she no longer needed me so I proceeded to turn around and she let out a cry, " CHUB CHUB NO!!!!!!!!! DON'T LEAVE ME!!!!!!" Well I found it very amusing so I saddled up and braved the puddle.  Then Taylor nearly drowned in one after that, but alas, we made it to Dunkin Donuts safely, where Taylor proceeded to buy a chai and get called a "Chiquita" by the guy behind the counter.  He gave her a sticker to, I think he wants her.  We made it safely back to the movie theatre, which was swarming with middle schoolers. Disgusting.  I decided tonight if I ever have children they're never going to be in middle school.  It's such an annoying age, so unnessicary.  I was going to kill those children, but anyways, the movie started and was fabulous.   I enjoyed it very much.  We then proceeded to return here, to my house, where we ate a lot of milk duds, and that folks, is my exciting life.  I leave you now with a quote that made me laugh very much today, it comes from none other, but Taylor.    *~Sooooo hot, want to touch the hiney~Taylor (when speaking about Ron Weasley)*   PS~ Bren and I went to the Y too and we're SO buff!!!!!!!!!! :o)

      Well, today was a very good day, to much relief.  I have amazing friends that make me feel so special and I'm taking this time to say thank you so much :o) I love you all oodles and boodles.  I got my permit, 100% on the test thank you very much, then I drove to the church to visit Julie, did ya catch that? Key phrase...I DROVE.  I know most of you out there that read my blog have your license...but ya know what? It's exciting for me.   I kinda realized last night that I get frustrated when I feel like people think they know me and judge me or whatever based on what they see and I just want to be like aah! You don't even know me!!! Which in a lot of cases is true because there is a lot about me people don't know, but then I also realized that its because I never tell them.  So if that makes any sense....my new goal is to be more open with people, and make better attempts to get to know people better, because I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way.  Also because there are a lot of people I know but don't really know that well, and I'd like to get to know better.  I think it would be nice.  So with that said!! I'm going to get some homework done then head to club!! Later gator :o)   *~Sing a sog, dance and celebrate...you've got today~Eliot Morris~*

      Hey kids! Well today there was so much to do but its all done now! I had an english presentation which I lost my voice in the middle of..but it was all good cause my teacher understood.  Then an algebra test, then a history test, but its all done!!!!! I didn't really do much homework....didn't really feel like it.  Got a phsyics test tomrrow that I'm not studying for.  But we all know physics is a joke.  *L-GaB* was supposed to go on tonight, but alas, we are put off again.  But just wait!!!! We will be awesome!!!! hehehehehehe :o) Hmm...this is not so intersting.  Bussey told me today that he reads 19 blogs...I don't feel so special for having a blog anymore.  But alas, I will get over it.  I just used the word alas...sorry, I'm reading the Scarlet Letter, some crazy old english junk.  So my day was basically unproductive after the whole school part, I was letting my brain rest.  I'm gonna go now, because I'm hungry and want some oreos!  *~Sometimes its easier to pretend you dont care than let your true feelings show and have your heart hurt more~* (oh what an emo little meggie) hehehehehe

      Day 2 of the new blog...in all honesty, I'm still warming up to it.  I miss my old one, we shared some good times.  But it is nice to be blogging again.  Today nothing at all exciting happened in school, but thats ok.  Then Taylo came over and proceeded to distract me from doing any work for four hours...but thats ok too, because I love her. WAIT!! Something exciting did happen in school!!! Heres how it goes, Matt Karlan is my lab partner, and as some of you may know, he's a smart kid, and we were doing problems today, and I got one right that he got wrong! And we'd been debating who did it right, and I totally owned him, it was quite exciting because I never get anything right in that class. So yeah, now I'm putting off more homework, which really isn't a good idea, and I should probably get to it! But blogging is so fun!!!! ADIOS!!! *~Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there, with open arms and open eyes yeah..~*

      Hey! So with the new makings of blogs everywhere I started to miss my old blog (meggiesblog.blogspot.com), which somehow died, and I decided to make a new one!! I'm excited, and hopefully this one will work.  Rest in peace old blog.  Well! Volleyball is over and its crazy how much afternoon there is.  I feel like its been two days since I was last at school, and its really been six hours.  Crazy, I'm tellin ya.  Wanna hear a funny story? Ok.  Today I walked into a chair in the caf.  Was that funny? I'm not sure, I thought it was.  Ok well in all honesty nothing exciting happened today, so I'm gonna go watch some tv.  Later gator!!

      Yesterday was much fun.  Except for the morning where my mother abandoned me at the emergency room to have my foot chopped open, so that she could make her hair appointment.  Then after the sketchy doctor cut open my foot, and patched it back up and what not, I call my sister to see where she is, but she's lost.  So me and my numb foot take a walk down the street to try and find the sister, but did I mention it was about 2 degrees out? Then as we are trying to find eachother on the phone, a van packed full of guys drives by, honks and presses themselves up against the window waving.  But finally my sister found me, and my still numb, and now cold foot got in the car and returned home.  After that, the day was fabulous.  Bren and I visited George, and he got us really cute neckalces (thanks George!) then we went to Wendys and came back and Taylor joined us, then Claire and Taylor convinced George to see Harry Potter so we all took a trip and saw it.  Harry was just as hot as he was the first time I saw it.  Taylor still wants Ron (I just don't see it) and Bren has affectionate feelings for Oliver Wood.  Unfortunately, George was not a fan.  Maybe when Hermione grows up he'll start enjoying it a little more.  Then we stopped at Dunkin Donuts (no Bren, not Duncan Doughnuts hahahahaha) and got some yummies.  After that we came back to my house and watched some of Contact.  It was enjoyable.  Today I woke up, showered, went to Nicks to have lunch with him and Katie, then we watched Spiderman and now I am home again.  Isn't that exciting? Well thats about it kids...I'm off to entertain myself :o)   *~Now I've got a peace of mind, there's just no better way.  And if I should die tonight, that would be alright.  I'm gonna try real hard, no matter what it takes and even if I fail.  I know that when life's done, and I'm accounted for, I lived it to the full.~Hangnail*

      I like this song, and it explains what I am thankful for on this Thanksgiving! :o)   *~I found it hard to believe, someone like you came for me you put this love in my heart I tried,  I could, I refused, you gave me no time to choose you put this love in my heart  I wanna know where the bad feelings go when I'm depressed  and I get down so low then if I see you calling to me,  it's all right I wanna tell you right now,  I'm not afraid to say how you put this love in my heart there's sometimes  when I doubt, but you offer me out you put this love in my heart  cause when I see that you died for me so when I was down  I had to believe cause you following her,  proving all your love and I know the loneliness I've had before in god now,  I never feel it anymore cause your lovin has released me  from all that is in my past so much more I could say  if I could just find a way you put this love in my heart  it's all so thrilling to me,  I feel so good I could scream you put this love in my heart I wanna know  where the bad feelings go when I'm depressed  and I get down so low then if I see you calling to me,  it's all right~*   ~Mxpx "You Put this Love in my heart"*

      Sorry kids, I don't even really know if anyone reads this...but just in case you do, it's not going to be a happy entry.  So if you don't want to read it, then I should warn you.  Today was good though, it was a nice snow day with lunch with Julie and Katie. Then Dave took me out to dinner with him and Gavven and it was fun.  Then Dave dropped me off at Amandas where I saw all the kids home from college.  Yeah, it made me so sad.  I came home early, and I'm sad.  I was so excited to see them and hang out with them again, but I guess seeing them made me realize how much I really miss them and how much everything has changed.  It's not the same at all now, and I realized how hard it is for me to not have them here.  I'm not saying that I don't have friends here because I do, and I love them.  But these kids, especially Kyle and Amanda have known me so long and know me so well, they're the people that know when something is wrong and I don't even say anything.  I just love them so much and it's so hard to not have them here.  And I have friends here that I have fun with and talk to, but I don't know, I can't even explain it really, I just miss them so much and tonight made me really sad for some reason.  Yeah, I don't know if that made any sense.  It's just me trying to explain how I'm feeling.  Night kids...   *~Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you, could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true.  If I only had one more day...~The Calling*

      Hellllllo, don't worry kids, I'm in a better mood today.  I just had to get that out yesterday.  Today was a pretty good day, I was just very sleepy.  Then I went to the Y, and Alex was there, and we chatted...but ya know what? I've known the guy 2 years and he still can't remember my name.  Amazing.  But anyways, the little anger and frustration that I had worked up today over a stupid boy, was worked out, and it felt good.  I think I may have a new addiction to working out, is that bad? It's just a really good way to get out my frustration I decided.  L-GaB TONIGHT!!!!! AH! So excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, we're gonna own it ladies.  Hmmmm.....yeah, what else? Nothing really....short blog, sorry kids.  Adios!  *~Never thought those times would last forever, but now that they're gone, I'm pretty sure we grew up to fast.

      Today wasn't really a bad day, not really a good day.  I guess I'm just havin all mixed up feelings sorta.  I think it's with all the kids coming home from college and seeing them and realizing how much I miss them, and I gues sorta feeling left behind.  I don't really let myself think about them because then I realize how much I miss them, but now that they're all coming back I remember and realize how much I've missed them and how much everything has changed.  It's not like everything has changed and is bad, it's just so different, and I've lost so many people that I was so close to, and I guess it's just feeling like I lost the people that I could trust and depend on the most and now I don't have a lot of people really at all that understand me or that I can really just go to whenever.  I know that it's also my fault because I take a really long time to trust people and to open up to them. Blah, I'm not making sense...I'm just babbling.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that today I just had a kinda lonely, left behind, not really having any friends day.

      Ya know what really sucks kids? When you write a nice lengthy blog, and the people out there in blog publishing land decide they don't like it...and bye bye nice long blog.  Yeah, that just happened to me.  Anyways...yesterday was good times.  I babysat my favorite child in the universe Wil Sorenson, and we spent some quality time together.  Then Bren and I went shopping which was time well spent.  Then a quick trip to Dunkin Donuts, picked up Tash and went to GIGA, which is always good times.  After that we headed to the play, which I enjoyed, even though it was slow at parts, but thats what you get when you turn an old book into a play folks.  Then we were all ready to L-GaB in the best way ever, but our target was mia, much to our disappointment.  But don't fear ladies, we will own it.  Today, I went to church and drove and it was exciting and now I am going to hang out with Ms. Amanda Cary because she is home from big kid college, yay!!!! Lalala, ok kids thats all for now, adios!   *~Don't let your dreams and love just live on the shelfs like dust cause time is passing fast away don't let your worries moev you, sing a dance and celebrate, you've got today...~Eliot Morris*   (yeah I know I used part of it the other day, but it's really good.

      Wow I like this song, a lot.....  "So it's safe to say that we've been here before; Heart torn out, down for the count and still come back for more. This lesson is learned too well. Though, only unlearned by the time your wounds have healed. Have you had enough? I guess not because your lips are stuck to his. It's Time to say enough is enough, you would be so better off. You love him but tough because it's not coming back from him. You can't win. Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on. Take a look around, you could have anyone. So leave undeserving him. It only hurts at first. But then you will find someone to give you everything you want. Try not to go running back to him. So it goes unsaid that we've been here before. Lonely nights and endless fights and sleeping on the floor. And he's sorry, so the story goes. It's read and replayed and ends the same way Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on. Take a look around, you could have anyone. So leave undeserving him. Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on. Take a look around, you could have anyone. "  ~Starting Line "Saddest Girl Story"

      Holla....Today was mucho fun.   Although we didn't have the much anticipated snow delay, school wasn't that bad.  I'm SO glad this week is over.  In physics, Matt (my sit next to kid) is mad at me because I gave him the silent treatment yesterday, so he didn't sit next to me.  But Sarah Bruno and I passed notes, just like middle school.  It was funny because once by accident I passed it right in front of my teacher, and then dropped it on the ground, again by accident, while still looking him straight in the eye, then proceeded to ask a question while picking it up.  I didn't even get in trouble.  Welcome to Mr. Marrashs world of physics.  Then ya know, Carly told some jokes, and we debated what color Mr. Marrash's hair was.  That was probably the highlight of school.  Then Taylo came over and George, Stella and Brian soon followed.  We hung out for a while and then Hathaway came with James and stole Brian, and our idea of sledding.  James said for us to call him at 6 to go sledding.  So we hung out a while longer, then called James and he told us to go to Arties to go sledding.  After waiting for my mom and getting all our snow stuff we were really late and called James to tell him we were on our way, he says ok.  Then he calls back like one minute later telling us we can't go anymore, that Arties parents didn't want everyone there or something, so we had to find somewhere else to go.  So we turned around and came home.  But don't worry, we made our own fun, and a lot of it.  Stella, George, Taylora, and I frolicked and played in the back yard snow, then watched Monsters Inc with Tash.  Stella had to go home though cause he has SATs.  So the four of us hung out a little, then Tash left, then Taylor and I walked George home.  Now we're here again, and we're having a sleepover.  It's good Chub Chub and Taylo time, you know how it is.  Adios my friend.   *~Freedom means love without condition, without a beginning or an end.

      Hey, sorry for causing some of you distress with my blog last night.  I didn't mean any harm.  Today was a much better day, I slept in and woke up to do more work, then went into school at 9:30.  Only to find out that we had an early dismissal...so I basically was only in school for 3 hours, and 2 classes were a free and art.  But yeah, still big history test tomorrow.  I'm taking a study break right now actually.  Ahhh I can't wait for this time tomorrow, you don't EVEN know.  So yeah I babysat Wil today too and it was good times as always, he is such a cute kid.  When you're stressed it is nice to hang out with little kids, because they just don't care about anything.  It's nice.  But yeah, there is still boy stuff.  Haha, it'd be nice if I could just get over it....but that doesn't look like it'll happen.  I know Tash!! I need to stay in check!! But I'm not.....yeaah......haha.  Ok well I have to get back to studying!! HAPPY SNOW!   *~I cant wait for this to end, and leave tonight behind us, I'm unsettled letting go of you, and sleeping the night in silence~Starting Line* (Thanks Tash!)

      Ah, I think I'm having a mental breakdown.  For real.  I went to school today, after waking up 45 minutes late, with having done, oh..no homework.  Went through a full day of no frees, not ONE break.  Came home, did 5 straight hours of homework, and wait, it's still not done.  But I can't do anymore, my brain just doesn't work.  I took a break and drove to Shaws with my dad which was probably the highlight of my day, because I got to talk to him and not think about school for a little bit, it was nice.  Then I came home and I don't think thats where I lost it....Don't get me wrong, I love all my friends and it makes me really happy that they feel like they can come and talk to me about problems and stuff but I signed on and literally five people were having problems, and it was a little overwhelming, and I kinda had a mini-breakdown.  I don't know...I guess it was one of those times when it would have been nice if someone asked me about me, but whatever.  I'm just stressed and tired.  I'm going to go talk to my mom now and see if she'll let me miss first and second period tomorrow.  I just need sleep and rest and I don't even know, just time to not be doing anything, because honestly that time doesn't exsist right now.   I miss summer, and not having anything to do ever.  Ok well I'm going to go talk to my mom and go to sleep.  Night night*   *~You got to hold on to what you got things might fall apart, but it don't mean nothing less you stick to your ways.

      Today in physics Sarah Bruno pushed the handle on the eye wash station by accident during lab, and it exploded like a volcano of water.  It had to be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I honestly laughed for like 10 minutes, and Sarah had a mini-heart attack.  Then Mr. Marrash and I got into a deep conversation about whether or not Santa's real.  He's got this whole magical elf other dimension theory...I don't know, but it got us off physics for a nice long time.  Good times.  Then I came home and watched Cruel Intentions, sat down to do my homework, realized that wouldn't happen, dilly dallied around until Shac, which was even more good times, then came home tried again to do homework...but ya know what? Tonight is one of those nights where it's just not happening.  Basically I'm screwing myself over for tomorrow, but oh well.   So yeah, on another note, I'm still trying to let go of this guy that just doesnt seem to go away.  Being friends would be so much better then being caught with all this emotion crap, oh well, I just gotta get over it.  We shall see!   *~Of all the things I believed in, I just want to get it over with, tears form behind my eyes, but I do not cry, countin the days that passed me by.

      Hola chillins....Today was monday, and school.  I feel like I've been on break for like 2 weeks, and now I have to go back.  But it's ok, because only three weeks til break.  Thats nice.  School was ok though, I did pretty well on a big fat history project, and that made me happy.  Then in physics Matt Karlan asked me to marry him, it was funny.  That class is funny only because I sit next to him and Sarah Bruno, it provides for much entertainment.  Hmm what else....I went to drivers ed for the first time, isn't that exciting.  There were only like six people there, I learned about drinking and driving.  Yeah, you're not supposed to...imagine that.   Yeah so I guess recently I've been thinking about someone a lot, and how they kind of have this strange affect on my life, I can't really explain it, but I've been thinking about it, and how it frutrates me that this person doesn't seem to let anyone in and I get frustraed that I can't figure them out.  Anyways...that explains my quote.  I'm going to take a bathtub because I'm FREEZING!!!!! adios :o)    *~If you need it, something I can give I know I'd help you if I can.

      Oh man, that was funny.  Last night Hathaway and like 20 other guys invaded my driveway and owned Brens car.  I must say, it was so funny, depends and post it notes? Very creative.  It was even funnier because I had called it like 10 minutes earlier that they would get her car, considering that she had left it in my driveway unattended for about 2 hours.  They were all still there hiding when we came back, and we almost caught Keith, but he had some smooth driving skills and got away.  But they left behind Artie and George...we got George and he stayed with us for a little while, it was fun times.  Hathaway better watch out though, caues L-GaB is going to own him yet again.  Besides that, last night Bren and I went to the diner with Gavven and Dave and Tash met us there and came back to my house with us.  It was good times overall.    *~Before you jump to conclusions about all the friends I have, I'd like to remind you that they were born that way~NFG*

      Hahahahahahahaha Oh man, I just had the funniest conversation ever with Charmaine.  She was listening to her island music in the car and started talking to me about it, and the way they dance, and when she dances with guys and stuff like that at pubs.  And she was saying how once this Jamacian guy (she's Trinidadian for those of you who didn't know) asked her to dance and they were dancing but she said he moved his hips to much like a girl, and she had to tell him to ease up because she was the girl.  It was so funny.  She is so funny when she gets going.  Yay! Leaving for Champion in 20 minutes!!! So excited.  It's going to be so cold though.  Well kids, I'm signin out for the weekend but I'll leave you with the funniest quotes of the day.     First~ Today in Physics (do I talk about this class enough?) We were talking about the Pharoes building the pyramids and Carly was like "Weren't the Jews forced to do it?" and Matt Karlan, who sits next to me, and is Jewish was like, " Look at me. Do I look like I could build a pyramid? Look at these hands, they're satin" Oh man, it was funny.     Second~ From my very funny conversation with Charmaine, talking about the dance she's going to tonight, "If the DJ play good, I'm goin dance....I didn't go to no dance to talk, I'm going to BOOTY."   Good times...hahahaha

      Today, I went to drivers ed, and during class I went to the bathroom and realized that the whole time I've been going to drivers ed I've been using the boys bathroom, so feeling stupid I found the girls bathroom. But I couldn't find the light in the girls bathroom, but feeling stupid already I decided to just pee in the dark instead of going back to the boys bathroom.  Well all was good until I looked up and realized their was a skylight (not that any light was coming in because it was dark) but there were shadows, and I somehow convinced myself that an alien was watching me pee on top of the window and I got all freaked out and ran out of the bathroom (after wiping and flushing of course) but let me tell you, it was scary.  Not to mention yesterday there was an Easter bunny on tv, and if you know me you know I was NOT ok with that.  At all.  So needless to say, it's been a scary 2 days.  Yeah.  Today....I don't remember anything particularly exciting or worth writing about besides what I previously shared with you...so this is where I shall end.    *~ You should have seen that sunrise, with your own eyes...it brought me back to life~ John Mayer*

      I have a problem.  I am addicted to free cell.  I even have the addiction mentality.  Want to know how bad it is? Here was my internal dialouge "Oh boy Meggie, you're so addicted to this game.  No I'm not, I could stop whenever I wanted.  Fine, then stop this game ight now.  No! I don't have to prove that I'm not addicted, I know I'm not.  Meggie, you have a problem."  Thats bad folks, thats real bad.  Don't ever start playing free cell.

      Hey kids....well in all the depression of yesterday I forgot to tell you all about the good parts! During physics lab, Mr. Marrash went on a 25 minute tangent, first about the origin of horse power, then about one handed push ups, then about the army.  It was so funny.  He just went off about it.  It was just flowing. Then during the second half of lab he went on another tangent, but I don't even remember what it was about.  All I know is that I don't ever learn anything in that class.  But hey, it's funny.  What was my other funny story? I can't remember.  But don't worry, there was funiness yesterday.  Today, I didn't really have many classes....and no physics!!! SO nice!!!! I got some nice fun stuff at CVS and then I went to the Y, and I think I figured out that another reason I've been having such mood swings is cause I haven't been exercising. I decided that working out makes me feel so much better and gets out a lot of frustration.  So it's good.  I feel good now, yay :o)  Yeah...still haven't done homework....I should go work on that....  *~More and more I need you now, I owe you more each passing hour the battle between grace and pride I gave up not so long ago.  So steal my heart and take the pain and wash the feet and cleanse my pride take the selfish, take the weak, and all the things I cannot hide take the beauty, take my tears the sin-soaked heart and make it yours take my world all apart take it now, take it now... ~Jars of Clay*

      Yeah, so I'm in a not so good mood again.  Sorry about that.  It seems like when I post I'm either really happy or really not.  I just have to make it to Christmas, I know my mood swings are just cause I'm tired and really stressed.  Two more weeks then a nice long break and I'll be ok.  I'm just letting things get to me and not focusing on the things that I should.  Then that stuff starts to really bother me and I get all down and what not.  The volleyball banquet was tonight and it was really good, but at the same time I can't help but be jealous of the juniors that played this year and that got captains, I know they deserved it and I am really happy for them because no one else deserved it, but theres still that small part of me thats like what if I had done this sooner or whatever, and I get all frustrated.  It's stupid and just needs to be gotten over.  Then theres the fact that I just don't understand people, and I know that that also has a lot to do with me and the fact that I put up such gaurds and don't let people see me but then I get hurt when they do stuff, not even knowing that it's hurting me.  It's all quite stupid.  I just have a lot of stuff to get over I guess.  Yeah well I have a lot of homework, and no I have not started it.  So I'm going to do that.  Night darlings.     *~Some say that time changes, best friends can become strangers, but I dont want that, no not for you. If you just stay with me we can make it through...~Good Charlotte*

      So last night was the silver ring thing, and I thought it was really good.  I'm feelin a lot better about the whole issue of  guys in general, it's nice.  Besides that yesterday I was in the Living Nativity, I was Mary and Wes was my Joseph.  It was good times.  At one point Wes hugged me and the kings told us to cut it out,  I thought it was amusing.  Hmmm what else, nothing really.  I'm hungry, and going to lunch with some kids later, but for now maybe I'll go start my homework because lets be honest, there's always something to be done Junior year.  Blah.     *~I don't know, I was DISTRAUGHT!!!!~Moaning Myrtle*  hahaha I love Harry Potter :o)

      Last night was the gift exchange at the Shac, and it was good times.  After that was the show, and the Good Fight played, and I love watching them play, so that made me happy.  Then Taylo slept over...like always.  This morning we had a really good conversation about our future husbands, and it was awesome, that's something to look forward to right there.  Then today she, Booth and I went to see Two Weeks Notice, but they were on their assigned date for Chemistry that their teacher is making them go on because they talk to much in class, so I was the third wheel, but whatever, it was all good.  While we were leaving the food court, this woman walks by with her husband I guess or boyfriend, and her daughter, who was probably like 5, and the woman out of nowhere just yells at the guy, and what she said will be my quote of the day, so I won't write it here, you have to wait til the end to see it.  It was so funny though.  Then Taylor and I went to GIGA, and it was good times like usual. Now I'm home, and bored, and I think I might watch The Land Before Time, yeah, on a Saturday night, it's ok, I'm comfortable with it.  So heres the quote you've been waiting for....  *~Don't ask me for sex, NO more!!! ~ Woman in the mall talking to her man*

      Yesterday, I walked into a wall. It was early in the morning and I didn't really have my eyes open because the light was so bright and going to go get into the shower I walked into the wall.   If I hadn't been so tired I probably would have laughed more at myself.  But I kinda grumbled.  But looking back on it, it was really funny.  This week hasn't been that bad so far, it's been a lot easier then I thought it would be, and after I hand in my Transcendental Notebook tomorrow life will be fabulous, 12 day weekend as Matt Nelson put it.  GOOD times.  Today in physics Mr. Marrash told us that everyone should be happy because it's almost Christmas, and my trusty lab partner Matt Karlan was like, "Um, I'm Jewish." and it made me laugh a lot, then we were talking about what he got for Hanukah, or however you spell it, and he was telling me and then he said, "My two front teeth" and I said "Matt thats a   Christmas   gift." all exagerating and what not, and he goes, " Well you know what! I actually got three!! What'd you have to say to that!!!" I thought it was really funny, thats why I just spent all this time sharing it.  Then this girl in my art class made me mad because she's stupid and was trying to talk about things she doesn't actually know anything about all like she does know.  I snapped on her a little bit.  But it's ok.  Now I'm off to finish this stinkin notebook...and it will practically be the weekend. YAY!!!  Adios my friends :o)   *~I know that you believe in the one, true God above.

      Well, this weekend was Lake Champion, I guess it was good, but I kinda had a rough time.  Anyways, today was an amazing day, I'm tellin you, when you leave stuff up to God, he makes awesome stuff happen.  Basically last night I came home like dead tired and just feeling like a blob and barely did any homework or studying, knowing that today I dropped my free and had a huge AP History test that I knew nothing about.  So I prayed a lot and went to bed.  Then today, I had a sub in Physics (if you know Mr. Marrash you'll understand why this is a miracle...the man never gets sick) and got to do a lot of work then.  But wait, out of nowhere my history teacher decides to move the test to tomorrow.  What the heck! God is awesome.  Now do you want to hear a funny story? Ok. In English class first period I was kind of asleep and just kind of watching people more then taking part in life, and this kid across the room from me blows his nose, and he pulls the tissue away and this booger the size of your mom comes out attached to the tissue, and he like tried to play it off, but I was the only one that saw.  And I had to try so hard not to laugh, but I really wanted to crack up, oh man it was funny.   But then again you gotta feel bad for the kid, cause who wants a huge booger hangin out of their nose....not me.  Anyways, Kyles home!! And she and her nine friends are coming to visit..and I need to study for that history test, so I'm outie.  Much love.    *~ I let you slip through my fingers, don't even know if I can remember how I got here in the first place.  My mind wanders off it's somewhere out in space.

      Merry Christmas! Hmmm....this Christmas has been very uneventful, and it doesn't even really feel like Christmas.  I woke up super early because my brother is still little and is all about the getting up early to open gifts, and I did that, and I didn't get much, just some clothes and a dvd, because I already got my SNOWBOARD which was all I really wanted and I'm in love with it.  So after that I went back to sleep until 12, and I'm still really tired, I think I may have mono.  I'm so tired.  Who knows, we're eating in like an hour and then I think I might just go back to bed, because it's either that or bum around my house all night, because everyone is away, or having family time, which my family seems to always lack in on the holidays.  Well until it's time to eat I'm going to go sit on the couch.    *~ I'm learning to breathe, I'm learning to crawl, I'm findin that you and you alone can break my fall.

      Hahaha I've had a funny day with my dad.  It started this morning where he had had a lot of coffee, and if any of you know my daddy, he's crazy.  So he was making fun of me and being the crazy old man he is and started telling me about some practical joke someone played that he thought was really funny and some other stuff.  Then we got in a fake fight and I told him I was going to beat him up and he told me I could try but I wouldn't be able to, but I did, I owned my dad because he's old, I gave him two wedgies, he told me that the next friend that comes over he's going to give them a wedgie to embarrase me.  Then I wanted to go to the Y and my dad let me drive, but   it as closed, and the parking lot was empty, so we practiced parking, because I suck at parking.  My dad kept making me park between the curb and a line and he kept telling me not to hit the bumb, and then I hit the bumb, it was funny.  So after that I came home and showered and ate some pizza then picked up my pretty new snowboard at the sport shop, where everyone and their mom decided to be.  Now I'm at home again, and I'm going to church in a lil bit, and then going again with my sister later.  My mommy made really good cranberry bread, I think I'll go eat it.  OH! And I saw the second Lord of the Rings last night, and it is SO good and I'm in love with Elijah Wood, even thogh he's not really in the second one.  And Tash is SO cute, she got me these really cute earrings from Baubles that I've wanted for a really long time but I've just been to lazy to get, so today, Tash is my favorite.  :o)   *~Don't hit the bumb, don't hit the bumb, don't hit the bumb...You hit the bumb~My crazy father*

      Well, I just returned from lunch with Katie Bennett, it was nice.  Sometimes I feel bad that I don't hang out with my old friends anymore but then when I do hang out with them it's so different, and the fact that with so many of my friendships now have the faith based element it makes them so much better, and different from my old friendships, I don't know, hard to explain.  But I had a good time with Katie and I like her very much.  Then I was very productive and scheduled a dermatologist appt, a dentist appt, and a haircut, even though I already cut my own hair this morning, and I must say I did a pretty good job.  But it still needs the aid of a proffesional I suppose.  Earlier today I met Taylor at Booths wrestling match and he won, it was intense.  I actually enjoyed watching wrestling, it's a cool sport.  Last night I watched the first Lord of The Rings with Bren and Katie, and it was so good, Elijah Wood is SO cute.  I have such a thing for dark hair and blue eyes, I love it, I already decided the guy I marry has to have blue eyes and dark hair, it's the only way it's going to work.  But right now I'm not looking for my husband, or any guy, which is nice.  It's so nice to finally be getting to a place where I'm not caring about boys as anything more then friends, because lets be honest it's taken a long time.  Anyways, tonight Bren and I are seeing the Twin Towers because we are officially Lord of the Ring dorks, especially after we  figured out that we're Hobbits.  It's our true calling in life...they eat like 6 meals a day, welcome to the lives of Bren and Meggie.  Wow, this has been a really long blog, I'm going to go do something else now.  :o)   *~I don't think he knows about second breakfast....What about Elevensies!?!?!?!~hahahaha the Hobbits* hahahaha

      Happy New Year!!!! Well I must say, not to toot my own horn, but last night I had a very good time.  I believe my sister and I were successfull in our party endeavor.  And if we didn't provide any entertainment let me tell you, other kids did.  I listened to Matt F. tell elementary school stories for like 2 hours, and I've never laughed so hard in my life.  He told the funniest stories I've ever heard.  Not to mention, TAYLORS HOME!!!! I missed her so much kids, you don't even know.  So last night she slept over, duh, and we had 3 full hours of Taylo and ChubChub time, it was so good.  Then today I've been being a bum all day, I went to Blockbuster to see if they had the movie I needed for history, but it was checked out, so I gave up on that pretty quickly.  Earlier I worked on the big fatty paper I have due on Friday, and it's now 3 pages done...2 to go.  Now I'm going to go get some yummy tea and watch some tv until dinner, because it's the last day of vacation, and I don't want to ruin it by being active.  Adios chicos and chicas.  OH! And by the way if any of you know Preston he likes to call me by my middle name, which I don't have to say, but last night I found out that his middle name is Edgar.  I thought I'd share that with you.  Ok bubye I love you.    *~I guess we've had our fun, but it seems our fun is over now and that's all right. It's all right.

      So, I just got back from Stratton.  It was fun.  Ready for a story? Ok.  So before we leave my mom is all, "Theres a VERY attractive boy thats your age that'll be there, he's Dune and Johns nephew, blah blah blah" So I'm all " Ok mom, whatever you say."  So we get there and I see this kid. First of all the kid looked like he was 10,  not to mention he was wearing Tigger pajamas.  Then he started talking, and he was one of those kids that you're just a little weirded out by constantly.  Oh, and he's a freshman.  Then on the second night all 8 of us children are sitting in the family room watching Sleepless in Seattle and I look over at him quickly and I swear I though I saw him take something out of his hair and put it in his mouth, but I dismissed this idea.  Later my sister nudges me and I look over, and the child has his entire big toe in his mouth, and is chewing on it.  What the heck!!??!!!?? I don't even know kids.  So now it's becoming really hard to not start laughing so I have to watch the movie again, then I glance over again, and this time, the kids done with his toe apparently and is PICKING HIS LEG HAIR and eating it.  I'm telling the truth people, he was plucking his leg hair and eating it.  Throughout the evening he went back to his toe, and chewed on it, or just picked at it and ate whatever came off.    And the worst part is he wasn't even trying to make it a secret, he was doing it in front of 7 other kids, not trying to hide it.  I don't know kids, I don't know.  I don't even know if my foot reaches my mouth.  It's all crazy business.  Otherwise though the snowboarding was really fun and I had a good time in that area.  Now my sister and I are home and it's time for FUGIS!!!   *~Yeah we make great friends but it just isn't the same...~Good Charolette*

I just wanted to apologize in advanced for not blogging for the next few days...because unlike all you other neglectful blog owners, I blog and quite frequently.  So, I'm sorry, if anyone reads this.  But I don't think anyone does.  Anyways, hopefully I will not fall and die snowboarding and I will be back to blog Sunday night.  Have a good weekend!

      Wow, I have been such a school slacker this week that it's not even funny.  But I've done pretty well for it...I got an 96 on my math test, and think I did pretty well on my english mid-term today.  Besides that today I went to the Y, and worked out so hardcore, I felt SO good after.  I got some pictures developed from New Years, showered, did a little work for the second part of my english mid-term tomorrow...and watched a lot of tv.  Darn, my life is exciting.  Anyways, what else, I've realized recently that I have a new found love for Norah Jones, yes Emily, I stole her completely from you.  I know this.   But Emily left the cd here and I listened to it yesterday, because I've heard a few of her songs and enjoyed them, and this cd is SO good.  She has a really awesome voice and all the songs are so good.  So thats my Norah Jones plug.  Okemo tomorrow, I feel bad, like I'm not excited enough, yes I am excited, but other people are so excited, and I feel like I need to get more hyped.  I'll work on that.  Well, I'm outie kids.    *~Nightingale Sing us a song Of a love that once belonged Nightingale Tell me your tale Was your journey far too long?

      Well I think today was possibly even more uneventful then yesterday.  I went to school, took an algebra test, came home, went to the dermatologist, came home, got a little bitter, studied, ate, studied, and watched tv.  The best part of my day was when I put up an away message that said I was sad and Kyle called me alllll the way from North Carolina to ask me why I was sad.  She is the bestest ever, and wins my favorite person for the day award.  Anyways, big fatty english midterm tomorrow.  It shall be interesting.  In other news, Charmaine is so funny.  On the way to the dermatologist she was telling me about Trinidad music again and we were listening to it, then she told me that she wants to teach me to dance Trinidadian.  She told me that it's all about shakin the hips.  I guess I'll have to work on my hips.  She told me about some songs she's going to try to get on cd for me to listen to because they're "real nice" and I can learn to dance to them.  Charmaine is so funny.  You should meet her sometime if you haven't already. Then she started dancing in the car all Trinidadian like and I laughed at her and she told me that I always look at her like she's old and crazy, and that she's not old and crazy.  Good times in the car with Charmaine.  Besdies that, on a completely different note, I feel like there was once this person who I was friends with and now, I don't even think they care that we don't really talk, and when we do it's pretty ackward.  But knowing me and the fact that I have no balls to say anything, I'm sure things will continue as they are and I'll just get more and more frustrated, but oh well.  It's just annoying I suppose.  Well, now it's 8:20, and I feel a little bit like going to bed.  Maybe I'll go do that.  Adios.    I stole this song from Tash, but I really like the lyrics, so today, you get a whole song~   *~There's something about the look in your eyes Something I noticed when the light was just right It reminded me twice that I was alive And it reminded me that you're so worth the fight My biggest fear will be the rescue of me Strange how it turns out that way Could you show me dear...something I've not seen? Something infinitely interesting There's something about the way you move I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing More subtle than something, someone contrives Your movements echo that I have seen the real thing Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you Strange how it turns out that way Could you show me dear...something I've not seen?

When I put up my guard around someone I get so sarcastic, it's not good.  I defiently saw myself doing it today and I was like woah...thats bad.  Besides that I took a nap...and not much else happened.  I have to go read for history.

      Well today in school, Abe Lincoln came to visit my history class.  It was good times, Mr. Clarke just gets crazier and crazier.  Walking to english in the portable Carly pushed the door so hard to go outside and it hit this girl right in the face. It was so funny, but must have hurt that girl so much.  She nailed her in the face.  Anyways..drivers ed I learned to use seat belts, and then I went to the Y.  Now I'm here, not doing homework, because frankly, I'm sick of homework, and of being a junior.  I'm being ansy...so I'm going to go do something, and I don't really have a quote for today.

      Sorry I haven't blogged for a while kids...shall I recap the weekend? Friday night Taylo slept over and Booth came to play with us for a while.  Then I broke Taylo, but it was by accident..I didn't mean to. But I think she's getting better.  Anyways after Booth forced us to watch football we realized we really liked it, and that we are going to start following it.  Then, we slept.  Saturday I woke up, sat around with Taylo for a really long time, then went to Mr. Kleins funeral, then went to GIGA, and then Bren Taylo and I set off for the night.  George joined us and we went to Post Road Diner, then we got Katie Baldwin and went Extreme Bowling.  SO fun.  But the best part was when I completely wiped out in the lane.   The four surrounding teams of bolwers thought it was really funny too and laughed a lot at me.  But whatever, I laughed too.  Then Tony and Tash came to visit and then we were done.  And I came home and slept.  This morning I woke up and went to church, then a leaders meeting, and then Keith and I rented Glory for history and speed watched it.  Now I'm putting off my other homework and waiting for Holy Ground. But I should go say bye to my sister cause she's leaving for school.  Bye Bye mis amigos.    *~And now I finally see that the further we go, we're only treadin ground that we already know...~Saves the Day*

      Hey kids....Most of you know this already, but Julie had a miscarage, and so if anyone actually reads this please pray for her and Chip, they really need it.  I don't really have anything to post because I'm really sad right now.  Maybe later.    *~And I find peace when I'm confused, I find hope when I'm let down not in me, but in You.

      Today we had a debate in history, and it was intense. But I didn't get to say much because Mike was really hard core because he's the debate team captain, but I suppose thats alright.  Other then that it was SO cold today, and I didn't even know what to do with myself.   I am very ready for summer.  I thought of something exciting to say earlier but I forgot it, sorry.  I think I might have to start studying for mid-terms soon...just a crazy idea.  I'm not really stressed about them though, and in order to be motivated to study I need to be stressed.  Maybe tomorrow.  But for now I go study for history quiz tomorrow.  Bye bye.    *~ The sun comes up every morning and I'm grateful for another day to be alive.  And you konw what?

      So...I feel like I have boring blogs now, but thats basically because my life has become very boring.  I'm sorry.  Today I had such an easy day, I'll explain it to you....Free first, no electricity or heat in portable second period = another free, french in the tech lab = playing on computer all period, algebra, free during lunch, sub in art = another free, history class to work on debate.  Wow, what a nice day.  I'm going to go eat ice cream now.    *~ And I know I'm making something out of this life they call nothing.

      Just got home from Okemo...so much fun.  Especially this afernoon with Taylor, Mark, Steven, and Bryan.  I think it was the most fun snowboarding I've ever had.  So thank you to those people who helped make that possible.  Now, I am tired and a bit cranky, and I a going to bed.  More about Okemo later.  Night night.

But I must say, I am very disappointed in all you out there who own blogs and don't ever write in them.  Poor little neglected blogs, it's like child abuse.  Go blog you bad people you.

      So I decided what I'm going to do with my life today.  Solve world hunger.  I know, it sounds a little crazy, but I have a plan.  I'm going to go to college, have a double major- journalism and business, and a minor in international affairs.  Now let me explain.  The Journalism major wil go along with the international affairs minor so that I can go to all these places where people starve and  write articles about them, and understand whats going on in these countries so that so many people are starving.  The business major is so that I can start a company like World Vision, that will support missions to places like and bring them food and all that stuff.  So, I decided all of this instead of studying.  But hey, at least now I have direction in my life.  -Peace

      Hmmm, you ever have that feeling where things aren't bad, but you just want things to change? Or your just waiting for something new to come along...but it doesn't? Yeah, thats basically how I've felt for like 3 months, and I'm really restless for some reason.  I just want something new to happen, but I don't really know what.  I'm just bored with how things are now.    I spent all of today studying for midterms, and then got in a fight with my mom.  Oh well.  I'm not really stressed about midterms, but I feel like I should be.  I probably will be freaking out Thursday night because Friday I have AP History and Physics.  Shoot me.  But once they're done it will feel SO nice.  Ok well I'm gonna go bumb around looking for something to do. -Peace

      Milford last night was awesome.  Now, I study, lots and lots and lots, and want to die.  But hey, it's only one week.  So today I made my first college visit appointment.  Scary, but also exciting...I'm getting excited for college, which I guess is a little too early considering I'm still a junior.  Oh well.  Ok well I have to go study some more french business, then some algebra, then some history, then finish my english project.  Yay for school!

      Today at lunch, Pete was throwing his sandwhich at people across the Caf and he was doing a pretty bad job, and then after about 3 tries, he hit Rob Christie right on the head, it was so funny.  I laughed so much.   All the midterms have been returned, I did ok, except for the whole 64 on physics...but then again, it's physics.  This weekend is Middle School Okemo trip, I am quite excited.  I think now I will go do history homework, and possibly start the paper thats due Friday, oh the possibilites.  - Peace  *~You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake, now I count the hours til you wake with your babies breath, breathe symphonies, come on sweet catastrophe.

      This weekend has been quite good so far.  Friday night I went to Fujis with Taylor, Booth, and George.  Then we dropped Booth off at Arties and decided to go get a movie.  While we were movie getting Tash called with Tony, and she and Brian Kelly came to my house to watch the movie with us.  Then Tash picked up Bryan McCaffery, and Caroline Riley and Jess Van Sciver, the silly little freshman girls, and then Bryan Stinchfield showed up, and then Tony.  Haha, I'm not sure how that many people got there...anyways we all watched High Fidelity, but I got frustrated because I couldn't hear and I've never seen it before so I gave up on watching it.  Then of course Taylo slept over.  Saturday....I went to the Y, good times getting buff, then GIGA, which was super as always, and then watched Life As A House, the best movie EVER, with Bren and Christine.  Yesterday, I went to Church, then the leaders meeting, then home, and hung out with Katie Bennett, which was good times because I don't get to see her much, but I love her.  Then Holy Ground, which was awesome as always.  Off to the Super Bowl party where the Buccanners (my assigned team by Taylo) killed the Raiders (Taylos assigned team by Taylo) and it was good times.  Especially skating on the ice.  Now...I'm off to the Y again, I'm sorry because that was probably the most boring blog ever.     *~Be joyful always~1 Thes. 5:16*

      So today while I was waiting for my mom to be ready to take me to my practice sat business, I was reading old posts from my blog and I laughed at some of them...and then I was like, when did my life get boring? Because it used to seem excitng, at least a little bit but now its boring, oh well.  I had really good Vavalas today, and GIGA tonight, I love Saturdays.  My quote is from a song that Taylor told me about, that I've never actually heard, but I like the lyrics.  -Peace  *~My best friend's always near me, cheers me, looking after me.

      I'm feeling mucho better today....I think I just had a big dose of self pity, then realized that thats stupid, and got over it.  I catch myself looking for fulfilment in things on earth, and then I realize that I'm never going to find it in anything here, because nothing here is perfect.  So I had some good time with God last night and this morning and it brought me back to feelin good and happy.  I really don't think I could ever express how amazing God is.  I've realized more and more that times when I get sad or lonely or whatever it's totally God pulling me back to him.  Now I am back to him, and its so good.  The snow day is beautius, and I'm going to go play in it with Wil Sorenson.  Much love.

      So heres my emotional spheel.  I've been sad for like the past 2 days, and I finally realized what it is.  I go through these periods when I realize how much I miss the kids that are all at college, and how much they mean to me.  When they were here, as in last year, besides just being my best friends, they were kind of like my protectors and big people that took care of me when I messed up or was sad.  They were just always there, and I love them so much, and I know they're still there for me but it's so hard to not have them here all the time.  I miss so much having those people who I could just go to, and who knew me so well, and knew when something was wrong, and as strange as it sounds, they basically just took care of me.  But now they're gone, and I'm the older kid now, and most my friends are younger, or my age, and I guess it's just hard to have to be the big older kid.  I guess this week I've had a lot on my mind and usually when I'm like this the older kids are the ones I go to, but I can't because they're not here, and with everyone here, I guess I know they care but I still feel like I'm burdening them with whatever...so I don't feel like I have anyone I can talk to and it just is hard sometimes.  I mean I love my friends that I have now, but I guess in some ways I feel like they all have something better, and I'm kinda left out with nothing.  It's probably not the reality of things, but thats how it feels right now...and it sucks.  I just don't really feel secure in anything, and I don't know who really cares and I'm always scared that I care so much more for someone then they care about me.  So for those of you who were wondering what was wrong...there ya go.  Sorry if you asked and I didn't tell you, I'm not really good at the whole sharing thing, until it basically is just going to explode out of me.  I think it just did.    *~"Hold on, if you feel like letting go.  Hold on, it gets better than you know.  Don't stop looking, you're one step closer.  Don't stop searching, it's not over.

      I'm kinda in a "rut" I guess you could say.  I've been in a blah mood for like 3 days, it's kinda annoying.  Stupid little things get me down.  Oh well, I will get out of it soon enough...I like this song, it's very girly, and sappy, but ya know what? It's my blog.    *~You light me up and then I fall for you You lay me down and then I call for you Stumbling on reasons that are far and few I'd let it all come down and then some for you   Pretty baby don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' around, oh pretty baby   And I know things can't last forever But there are lessons that you'll never learn Oh, just the scent of you, it makes me hurt So how's it you that makes me better   Pretty baby don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' around, oh pretty baby   Why can't you hold me and never let go When you touch me, it is me that you own Pretty baby, oh the place that you hold in my heart Would you break it apart again, oh pretty baby   Pretty baby don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' around, oh pretty baby ~ Vanessa Carlton*

      I was reading my old blog...and I found this post, and it made me laugh, and remember last year.  So I'm going to post it here.  I got sad reading it because all these people are so far away and its crazy how different things are now.  I miss these people so much, and I love them, it's really hard to explain, but I miss them so much.     June 2, 2002   Look! I'm posting!!! YAY! Thats exciting. Today, I went to church ce matin and then I went to bible study, one after another. Lots of time at church, but both were good. I got home and Amanda had called, so I went over to her house and hung out. Wes and Pete were swimming and Kyle and I went out to visit them and then Kyle tried to push me in the pool, I don't really remember what happened but I know that I was almost in the pool and thinking about how badly I didn't want to go in, so I grabbed onto the closest thing, which just happened to be Kyles hair. I was pulling it so hard just trying to not fall in, and then I realized that it was Kyles hair, and it probably was hurting her, so I pulled extra hard to get up and ran past her inside. She ran in after me and told the boys so Kyle, Matt and Goat grabbed me and with much effort (because I'm huge and put up a good fight) threw me into the pool. Wasn't that nice. Later when I took my shorts off to put them in the dryer Goat stole them and the boys procceeded to play catch with them in the pool, Matt even put them on. Then Goat threw them into the Gallos yard. So I had to walk soaking wet with no shorts over to the Gallos to get my shorts. Don't my friends love me. Out of love I have for my friends, I'm using Amanda as my quote for the day.  *~Can you ask them to get a towel and do it on the floor?~Amanda*

      Wow, it's been so long since I blogged! Sorry kids....Okemo this weekend was so much fun.  Those middle school kids are so cute, but I am so glad that I am no longer in middle school.  I would like to just add that I am so proud of Taylor, because she did the rainbow rail! Good job Taylor, unlike myself, Taylor is a very talented snowboarder...she grinds the rainbow rail....I fall off a jump and almost die, you see the difference? Today, I had a driving lesson with Giovanni, it was quite entertaining.  I think he might have been high, but he was so funny.  Yeah, school wise I had 3 frees in a row, that was nice.  Then I came home and was talking to Artie, and he had just made muffins, and invited me and George to come have some, and being the fat kid I am, I went across town and had some quite yummy muffins.  Now, I am taking a homework break.  And there is the exciting story of my life.  Todays quote comes from Giovanni.    *~Yeah, at the stop sign you have to make sure that that thing that happens at stop lights, ya know where you move forward a little bit, that has to happen.  I don't know, it's got somethin to do with the laws of physics I think.~Giovanni on stop signs and physics*

      HAPPY VALENTINES DAY! I hope you all are having a fabulous day, and if you're one of those people who gets all sad or whatever because you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, don't be! Because Valentines Day does not have to be about that, it's about loving your friends in general.  SO get over it and buy someone a box of chocolate! But don't be like Taylor and do that, then eat it.  Today in physics Matt (the faithful lab partner) carved "I love Meggie" and "Meggie Rox" into the desk.  He's going to get me in trouble with the teacher or something.  My brother and his friend Will are sitting next to me playing video games and they just got into a fight about that cheerleading song and whether or not its "Like totally for sure, I just got a manicure." or "Like totally for sure, I think I need a manicure"  I think that makes them big fat losers.  But at least they're entertaining.    Well we're finally on vacation...and I'm really excited, I think it's going to be good.  For starters Taylor and I are getting together and watching Moulin Rouge, so I'm going to go get ready for that.  First, by taking advil, because I just played with little kids for 2 and a half hours, and yes, it made my head hurt.  Peace out .  *~This is My commandment: Love one another, just as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.~John 15:12-13~*

      Good day turned bad turned good.  Thats the way to go.  I know that I quoted Taking Back Sunday 2 days ago, but this line from this song, that Taylo and I are sitting here listening to is making me think of my day.  Theres 2 parts of it that I will quote.   Make that 3.   *~The truth is you could slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt~* *~These grass stains on my knees they won't mean a thing~* *~You're a touch overated, you're a lush and I hate it~*  ~All compliments of "You're so Last Summer" by Taking Back Sunday :o)

I'm hyper right now....an hour of SAT tutoring, and then homework makes me a little ancy.  I just thought it was important to mark the start of plan detox in my beloved blog.

      Yay for half days.  Snow is so pretty when it first falls, I enjoy it very much.  I got new binders and pencils from Staples today, and got quite excited about them too because I'm a big fat dork.  But hey, it's ok.  I just read Tylers blog, and I want to start a scrapbook now.  It's quite a good idea.  Maybe once I'm not lazy I will.  So Taylor and I made a decision, we're going to wax our legs, we figured that we don't really shave as it is (sorry if this is too much information for any of you out there).  But yeah, we're going to go together and get it done.  Thats my exciting news of the day.  I have a headache so I'm going to go watch tv.  -Peace   *~Why can't I feel anything for anyone other than you. Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens.  A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins , I will never ask if you don't ever tell me. I know you well enough to know you never loved me, and all of this was all your fault.  And all of this...I stay jealous, I stay wrecked and jealous for this, for this simple reason I just need to keep you in mind as something larger than life.

      Today was a bueno day.  Church and the lead meeting were super, then George called when I got home and we drove to the mall and got Wetzel Pretzels, and saw everyone and their mom there, but it was fun.  Then we called Booty to see if he was home because we wanted to visit, but he was at Post Road Diner with Andrew and Artie, so we stopped by there to visit, and they were all getting fat eating really big meals.  Hathaway decided to smear his all over his face too.  Holy Ground was super as always, and now my dad "wants to talk to me for a minute" I think it's going to be a little more then a minute.  Oh, the other funny part of the day, I got in the car after the Lead meeting and my dad goes "I like you the way you are when we're drivin in the car" Yes, my 66 year old dad was singing Avril Lavigne.  Oh boy.  A Dios!   *~Now I've got a peace of mind, there's just no better way. And if I should die tonight, that would be alright. I'm gonna try real hard, no matter what it takes and even if I fail.

      Tonight I saw the Life of David Gale....it was rated R, but George, Taylor and I got in, and so did Kait, but shes 17.  I felt quite good to get in and not be carded.  Then, possibly one of the funniest things I've ever seen happened.  We were all seated, and the lights were dimming as the movie began, and some late comers came in and got in the row behind us, the last guy, who I guess his friends made move to the inside was scooting along the aisle with a bag of popcorn, and gets bumped, and dumps half of his bag of popcorn on Taylors head.  It was so funny. Oh man, I'm laughing now thinking about it.  Other then that this woman in the row in front of us was bitter and yelled at us like 79476549 times for having our feet on the seat...and George pointed out at the end that she was probably just bitter because her boyfriend was a loser.  Probably.  He was short.    *~I have no quote today~*

      I had to ditch Taylor today, and get my legs waxed...her hair just wasn't growing.  She was a little upset with me but it's all good now.  And I'm smooooth.  Babysat Wil for 5 hours, I love the kid, but yeah,  5 hours with any 2 year old is quite a long time.  What else....SAT stuff, yeah, boring.  Hmmm, oh just some clarification, I'm not exactly excited about prom yet, but Bren got me all thinking about who to go with and that stuff....that makes me anxious, and I don't want to think about it.  Yeah.  Anyways,  I was supposed to go to dinner with my mom tonight, but she ditched me.  Who gets ditched by their mom? Apparently I do.  Oh well.  - Peace  *~And if you were with me tonight, I'd sing to you one last time.  A song for a heart so big, God wouldn't le it live.  May angels lead you in, hear you me my friends.

      Wow, I had a busy day today...but it felt good to be productive.  Now I'm home, and tired, but I have to read like 30 text book pages for history...maybe I'll do that tonight.  But probably not.  So, I got girly, and I didn't want to, but I started thinking about prom.  Now, I'm all anxious like.  But whatever, I'll get over it.  I wish I hadn't started thinking about it.  Other then that, break has been good.  Relaxing, but productive.  This is going to be a short blog, because I don't really have anything exciting to post, sorry.    *~This is the closest to this friend that I've been, I hope you find it on greener ground and bluer skies, I hope you don't think less of me if I'm cold I don't want to watch you go~Get up Kids*   PS~ Taylor says "Tell your blogger fans I say 'hi', actually 'hey' no wait, 'yo', actually, 'salutations', no, 'howdy'......Actually, tell them I say all of them"

      Taylo and I had so much fun being snowed in today.  We made Shepards pie that was SO good, and ran to Hathaways to get a beef bullion, that was funny.  Then we tried to make a fort, but it was SOOO bad, we failed miserably, but laughed about it.  Then Taylor went home and I took a nap.  Had good conversation with Tash and Katie.  Now, I'm bored again.  Yeah, by the way, in case you didn't know its probably one of the worst feelings in the world when you're waiting for someone to call you and then you call them and they made plans with other people and didn't even bother to let you know.  But whatever, I'm going to go watch Everwood.  *~He can make me happy          (It's a long silent peace)  And I will only love him          (It'a a weakness in your knees)  And I will never look down  Down is where we came from          (It's a perfect place to go for everlasting love)  Because it's all in the past          (Nothing to fear, nothing to hide)  He took a load off my chest          (You just say what's on your mind)          (Needn't think before you speak)  Ooh cause it's not happy          (This is how it's meant to be)  Cause I had needed his help          (Never high, never fall)  No matter how by myself          (You can do no wrong at all)  I am going nowhere          (In this heaven up above filled with everlasting love)  And now I'm changing my plans  Because we only live once  Ooh could be this happy  Once, I could live by his side~Guster*

      Today was mucho fun...First Taylor...or should I say, Waldo, woke up and watched "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead" quality entertainment if you were wondering.  Then, we were about to do pilates and Julie called, and said she'd be at my house in 20 minutes to pick us up for our Valentines Day party shopping and so we had to shower super fast and be ready.  There was an amusing experience that happened when Waldo was showering, but I don't think I'll tell it because it'll probably just sound weird...but it was so funny.  Anyways, we shopped and then met all the other girls and went to Wilton for some good ol' fashion cookie making and bible study.  Good times.  Afterwards Bren, Waldo, and I went to Barnes and Nobles and got good books.  Headed to the wrestling FCIACs and saw some good moves, and you'll never guess who we saw.  Ok, I'll tell you.  Bren and I saw HOT KID FROM CANCUN!!!!! I'm not kidding you folks, it was crazy to see him.  Then to Hathaways, where we watched a movie, one that made me particulary jumpy.  The end was lame though.  Now I'm home....Did I mention how happy I am that we're on break? Because I am.    So Taylor got me into this song that I'm listening to right now...and it's so cute.  Makes me want a boyfriend though...bad news.  Oh well, I'm going to qoute it, the lyrics are a guy singing to a girl, and maybe...one day...a guy will write a song like this for me.  Haha...what a silly girly thing to think, haha.    *~I look at her and have to smile, as we go driving for a while.  Looking nowhere in the open window of my car, and as we go the traffic lights.

Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road, knowing that she's inches from me...~Stephen Speaks*  :o)

      I've had 2 songs stuck in my head all day, and I think I'll tell you what they are.  First, the song that goes "Little Italy eh, chingity ching eh on eh on, the Italian Christmas donkey..." yeah you know, kinda strange though, considering it's not Christmas.  The second, is only one line, but it won't go away, I even said it to the man at the bank today, "Holla back youngin".  These two songs have just been going through my head, back and forth back and forth.  Crazy.

      Ahhh, I'm not in a very good mood, pre registration was so frustrating, on top of the fact that I might not even be here next year.  Yeah, boo.  Anyways, I had sushi for dinner and it was good.  I should be studying for my history test right now, but it's going to suck anyways.  Well, isn't this a depressing blog, I might as well add that we are about to enter my least favorite month of the year, March.  Blah.    *~I guess that I'm wrong for fallin in love, but you're still the one that I'm dreamin of.

      We had a field trip to the city today for AP History, it was quite fun.  But we had Chinese Buffet for lunch, man, it was SO bad, then when I was going to throw out my basically untouched plate, this guy that had been begging for money came up and took it from me, so at least he got a big meal.  To make up for it though Mr. Clarke took us to this really good pastery place in Little Italy, yeah, I enjoyed that.  Then, getting on the subway back, when we were getting on Mr. Clarke realized that we were missing Tess and Mr. Baldwin who was chaperoning, and ran back to find them, so our class rode the subway alone, and missed our train, but it was an adventure.  All the girls talked about prom, I don't like to think about prom, it's so stressful to be all like "Who am I going to go with?" so, I'm not going to think about it.  Other then that, I'm really tired, and I think I blog too much, no one else seems to.  Oh well.  I enjoy it.    *~This is my voice,all shadows stayed, this is my heart, upon the altar laid.

      Today in physics, Matt (the faithful lab partner) and I got in a little fight.  First, I took his pencil, then he stole my worksheet, and turned it into a paper airplane.  So I asked Mr.Marrash for another one and showed him what Matt had done to mine, and he told Matt that if he was going to do that he might as well have made it a good one.  Then, I took out my green marker, and drew on Matts arm, well let me tell you, I've never seen someoen get so sassy about a little green marker, so he stole the cap to my marker and started to shove paper in it so I wouldn't be able to put the cap back on my marker and it would dry out.  This went on for quite a while...we had lab, so 2 periods of it, then he gave me my cap back and just to let him know that I own him I had to take out my purple marker and draw on him again.  Well didn't he get mad, he stole my green marker and drew all over me.  Anyways, be the end of lab I had marker all over me, and had learned nothing.  Besides that, today was quite usual.  I made muffins when I got home, those were good.  Hmmmm, nothing else.  Adios.    *~ I'm takin you to Italy we're gonna sail to Rome, if we find Hawaii then we'll make that our home.  I'm takin you to London then we'll backpack to France.  Leave this town again without you? There ain't a chance.~Stephen Speaks* :o)

      Aaaah sometimes stuff sucks, especially when people don't understand you.  I'm not bitter or angry or jealous or anything, just hurt, and I know that when I get hurt by someone I don't show it and I just deal with it in my own way, and apparently I'm being "cold".  I'm not resentful, I just need time, and if thats coming across as me being cold, or not hurt or angry then I'm sorry.  It's hard when you don't feel like you can trust your best friend.  But no one seems to understand that, so I guess I'll just deal with it all on my own.    *~Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.

I wonder, is there anything that I'm going to miss? I wonder how it's going to be when you don't know me? How it's going to be when you're sure I'm not there? How it's going to be when there's no one there to talk to, between you and me, I don't care.~Third Eye Blind*

      Last night was much fun....the volleyball game was very entertaining, and what I saw of The Bourne Identity I enjoyed.  Then Taylo slept over, and it was nice.  Now, I believe I'm going to make some egg whites for lunch, ooooooh yum.  PS, if you see Julie Valandra today, give her a hug or something, it's her birthday.  What a short blogblog.  Oh yeah, it's also really sunny out, thats nice.  Anything else? I don't think so....maybe I should go now, because I feel like this might be painful for the people reading it.  haha sometimes I amuse myself, Peace out.    *~I'm growing up again...I'm learning to accept that all good things must come to an end.I'm growing up again...I'm trying to understand what it's like to let go of a friend.~The Ataris*

      Good song right here folks, these are only part of the lyrics...  *~When the night seems so long (throw your hands to the sky)  You can sing a new song (wipe the tears from your eyes)  When you're weak, He is strong  He can heal your wounded soul  and calm the storm inside   For all your times of laughter  In every hopeful prayer  When the world weighs on your shoulders  Through sorrow and your despair  With everything, with every breath, praise the Lord~Third Day*

      I am dying an inevitable, slow, painful death. There is nothing your or I can do about it. My throat is swelling, and will soon close, cutting of air circulation, and my nose is running a constan marathon, while also becoming a breathing blockade. My legs feel like noodles, well done noodles at that.  When the two of these merge, along with the inevitable inability to walk, death is invetiable. While some may say what I am suffering is a common "cold" I know that it is not. It is much, much more. It was nice knowing you. Maybe I should write my will....what do you want from me? Please let me know before breathing becomes too much of a strugle and I am weak to conjure breath to continue life.   I have 2 quotes of the day, because first, I was reading my old blog, and I found a post about one of the funniest things that I've ever done, and so I'll post that little bit, then a song quote.  I will probably never see you again, so have a nice life.    "Guess what I just did? I burnt my face with a lean cuisine. OWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Someone should have told me that i'm not capable of talking on the phone and making microwave food, but they didn't. And I dropped the lean cuisine and it splattered on my face. OUCH!!!!! I even have a burn, its a little blister under my eye" -Meggies old blog...oh I amuse myself, that hurt so much though.    *~Everything happens for a reason is no reason not to ask myself if I am livin it right~John Mayer~*

      Today was better then yesterday.  But I'm sick, oh well. Anyways in Physics Mr. Marrash told like a 20 minute long joke, with the dumbest punch line ever.  But at least it was 20 minutes of non-physics.  Other then that I went to the doctor, and my sister got me Vavalas because she loves me.  I think now, I do homework.  Peace out.

      I wish I could do something to remove what's hurting you and leave only a smile in its place, but that isn't what either of us need.  You will learn from this.  It won't kill you.  If life were going to do that, it would already have accomplished its task.  Instead, you will suffer.  You will hurt.  You will endure more than you could have ever imagined and you will grow.  These moments will leave scars and those scars will in turn fade in time, but they will only make you more beautiful because anyone can be foolish and young but wisdom can only be acquired through experiences that transform us, that forge our personalities in blast furnaces and cauterize our wounds.  Someday, we will all be whole and we will intuitively recognize each other - not as we are or appear, but as we are meant to be.  Tyler is awesome.

      This part of this song expalins a lot of how I feel right now,  I don't like being all self-pity and crap like that, but it would be nice if just one thing was gong well.  Whatever, it'll all get better eventually.    *~And it feels like I'm at an all-time low , slightly bruised and broken from our head on collision. I've never seen this side of you, another tragic case of feeling bruised and broken from our head on collision. I've never seen this side of you another tragic case, another tragic case of feeling bruised and broken another tragic case, and I've been still waiting for a good day still waiting for a good day~New Found Glory*

      Ok, so heres the low down on Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I decided to make a list.  First, we'll start with the positives, then the things that I personally found just a little strange, then the negatives.   Positives~  1.  The city is really pretty, not very big, but nice.   2.  Even though it's really cold in the winter, it doesn't get cloudy, it's like always sunny, just freezing.  3.  The kids I met were nice, even though they were a bit Minnesotan . Ok..well those are all the positivies I can think of for the moment....maybe more later.    Strange Things~  1.  It's so cold in the winter that in the city they have sky walks between all the buildings so that you can basically get anywhere in the city without having to go outside.  It's like a big hampster cage or something.  2.  All the people are that super friendly that kinda creeps me out, like they're all actually about to explode and kill someone.   3.  The kids that I met last night, they have this saying, where they say "Oh you totally tweeked" or "She's tweeking"  I have yet to figure out exactly what this means.   4.  There are about 8239047459860 lakes in Minnesota, on their license plates it says "10,000 lakes" and the lakes freeze in the winter because it's like -30 (maybe not really but thats what it feels like) and for fun, people DRIVE THEIR CARS on the frozen lakes.  And I thought there was nothing to do in Darien.    Negatives~  Basically, the city is nice, and I'm sure the people who live here like it, but it's not home and it's not the people I love.  And it wasn't until I left home that I missed the comforts I didn't even know I had, and the people I didn't know kept me alive.  I don't think that I would fit in so well in Minnesota, I don't say things like "dont'cha know" and "tweek" and I'm not super peppy all the time.  Oh, and just in case you were wondering, in the midwest, sweatshirts, and straight legged jeans never went out of style, netiher did mullets.    Anyways, thats the low down on Minnesota.  I have to go now because I have to visit 2 schools before I finally come home.  Bye bye.    *~Spinnin, laughin, dancin to her favorite song.

      So I just talked to my mom about this nanny trauma...and she told me that I was forgetting one of them...apparently when we first moved to Delaware, I had a midget for a nanny...but they had to fire her because I was that age where I ran around a lot, and according to my mom "Not only was she short, but she was heavy" and couldn't keep up with me.  Anyways...I just had my last driving hours, yay! During the practice driving test my instructor was so funny when he was telling me what to do on the real test.  He earns the quote of the day.    *~Blinker the crap out of them~Silly driving man with the thick accent*

      Tonight was really fun....I had a nice dinner with my dad and had a really good conversation with him, I know he's an old man and everyone think's he's just crabby and crazy, and he may well be...he's my daddy and I love him.  It was a really nice talk.  Then Bren came over, and we talked to my dad about my old nannies, and I've had nannies since I was born, and I'm starting to think they're the reason I'm so weird. Can I just describe to you the few I remember?  We'll start with Ginny, she was my first nanny ever, and she was so nice, but I think her son was in the mafia....but whatever, I used to sleep over at her house when I was like 2, she was like a grandmother.  Next that I remember was Suzie, she was nice, but she had two boyfriends...Richard and Bill, she lived with Bill, and we would have sleepovers there, he had cats.  Richard worked at the bank, and apparently my dad said she had a third boyfriend in California.  This didn't all register with me.  Then I remember Lauren, she was nice, but she was so 90's...all about the work out videos and that stuff.  Next in my memory was short experience with "Aunt Kathy", this woman was not my aunt, she took me fishing once...I don't remember what happened to her.  Then, Marjena, she was Polish, had a little white car, spent a lot of time in the bathroom, had this hand lotion that smelled so bad, I can still remember the smell, and big purple frame glasses.  I remember once we were being loud in the car and she pulled over and said she wasn't driving again until we were quiet.  The last Delaware babysitter I remember was this girl that I made my mom hire because she looked like one of the girls on "The Round house" and I thought it would be cool to have her as a babysitter (mind you I was like 6), and she got fired, and stole my first pet ever, my goldfish.  Yeah, very sad.  Moving on to Connecticut babysitters....first was Barb, she was a hefty woman so to speak, and wouldn't let me touch her face because she said she never had a zit in her life and if I touched her face she'd get a zit.  I remember her coming home one night at like 4 in the morning...probably drunk, I think that ended Barb.  Then Kesha, she was really sweet, but then her husband Robert from Oregon moved in with us, then they decided to move back to Oregon, but I really liked Kesha.  Then there was this Australian woman, she hated us, it was funny.  She didn't last long, and after she was gone, we found a letter she had written home and saved on the computer about how much she hated us, that was funny.  I think next was Annette, she was from Trinidad, and nice, but kinda old and strict, she left to get married, and so then came Charmaine...and Charmaine I'm proud to say is still with us.  She is the best, she brings the flava...ask Taylor.  Anyways, maybe this gives some insight into why I'm a little on the weird side, look at the people that had a big part in raising me.  Yeah.... Anyways, tonight was really fun, read Tash and Brens blog to find out about it.  I'm tired and going to sleep....aaaah sleep. Yay! Night! :o)   *~I'm sick of being caught in yesterday~Ataris* (Thanks Tyler!)

      You know that feeling when something so good just suddenly goes away and you want it back really badly, but you can't ever have it back because people change, and things change, and it never goes back to what it used to be.  And sometimes you just want to go up to that person and ask if they even care....yeah, I have to get over that feeling.  I think it's time for my favorite Ataris song ever.....hahahahahahahahahahaha I'm so emotional, whatever, this is my blog, and I can be as emotional as I please :o)   *~You told me that you loved me, I started tearing down those walls. I really started to trust you but you set me up to take the fall. I guess I'm not prepared to say... Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again Until next time that he goes away.  I guess that I'm wrong for falling in love, But you're still the one that I'm dreaming of. I guess that it's you I want to hold onto, But you're holding onto someone else~The Ataris*

      Why do I even worry? I'm all freakin out last night, and I open up my devotional and what does it say, "Relax I'm in control -God" Thanks God.  Then, I'm sitting here now, reading this little book of quotes I have, and this is the one I opened to and read.   Let me share...because God is just awesome.  "As the melody of our lives unfolds on a daily basis, the high point lies in the fact that God is never going to make a mistake with the motif that he's specifically designed us for.  Whatever he does will endure forever.  He brings out the beauty of harmony and richness as he directs every facet of our lives.  This fact gaurentees that all crises already have been met and overcome in him.  As we live, work, and bear our burdens, be assured that the melody of our lives is controlled by the eternal God of the universe who knows us from beginning to end" - Luci Swindoll.   Man, I really don't need to worry ever, God is so in control.  Other then that....my life is boring, and I have had an extremely dull week.  Haha.  Bye kids!!

      AHHHHH I just sat for like 5 hours...in addition to the 6 I already did at school.  I came home and went to drivers ed, then I had a practice sat, another 3 hours of sitting.  SO I'm a little on the wirey side.  Let me set up the drivers ed scene for you, it was me, and about 30 sophomores...it wouldn't be so bad if I had just been a slacker or something, but the truth is, these sophomores are older than me.  It's crap I tell you, crap.   In other news...I'm going to be honest with you blog readers out there, I'm listening to some Tim McGraw and Faith Hill right now...because, I have a little thing for sappy love songs/country, and this song is hittin the spot right about now, shall I seranade you a little "And now that we're together I'm stronger then ever..happy and free.  Oh it's a beautiful thing, don't think I can keep it in.  And if you ask me why I've changed I don't think I can keep it in.  It's your love, it does somethin to me, sends a shock right through me..." So on and so forth.  I think you get the picture.   So I'm going to return to my apples and peanut butter...taste a pretty nice, pretty nice.....  My quote is for Taylor today, because she was sick, and I made her laugh and it hurt her.... *~Fine...just go....catch a chicken~* hahahahaa

      GOATS HOME!!!!!!!!!!! Let me set up the situation for you....So here I am, over the garage, doing some stinky history homework, and then I hear my sister come home.  She walks in downstairs and is all "Meggie come here!" and I'm all "Why?" Thinking she's going to give me some chore or something like that.  So she's like "Fine don't come" and I feel bad, so I go downstairs, and she has the fridge open and says " Did you take out the trash?" and I said "I didn't know I was supposed to take out the trash" A little annoyed because who wants to be called all the way downstairs by their sister to take out the trash? Not me.  So imagine my suprise when she closes the fridge and there is no trash, but a Goat! Yaaaay, so that was my very happy experience of the day, and I thought I would share it with you  Other then that, church was really good this morning and so was the lead meeting.  I was just watching Winning London, yes that would be the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie, and ya know what, they have the cutest boys in those movies, and both of them got cute boys.  I'll admit, I was jealous, where's my cute boy? I guess I have to be a super famous identica twin with my own clothing line to get one.  I'll work on that.  Hmmmm, I want summer.  I got summer anxious really badly today, and that is why I'm not doing my work right now.  Yep Yep.  Well, I think I'm done here.    My quote of the day is inspired by the fact that Tyler, Taylor and I are going to see Hot Rod Circuit in 12 days, VERY exciting.  :o)   *~ Lie awake, wondering,If things could have been much different.  Second chance, what's become of a friendship if you can call this one? Stayed in touch, stood behind, while I gave you space and you invade mine.  While everyone makes mistakes, you let me down for the last time, truth prevails and theres nothing you can hide. And I wash my hands of you, getting on with my life.~Hot Rod Circuit * (duh)

      I came home yesterday from babysitting...where I was til 5, and there was a car in my driveway.  I was perplexed, because it was a blazer, and no one I know drives a blazer.  So, I come inside and ask my sister who was here, she tells me that my friends came over and directs me over the garage.  I go over the garage, and there are George and Taylor, who had been here since school got out.  Quite interesting, considering that school had gotten out 2 and 1/2 hours ago.  Anways, we hung out and found some other kids throughout the evening.  Then George got in on some Taylo and ChubChub time because he slept over, but I got tired, and went to bed, so they had George and Taylo time, and it was nice.  THE THUNDER STORM WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just thought I should say that.  I love thunder storms.   Drivers ed this morning...no good, but license SO soon, good.  I think I'm blabbering? Maybe.  IT'S SO nice out right now, and HOT ROD CIRCUIT TONIGHT!!! WOOHOOO!!! I am excited.  Now, I go, and I don't know what, but this blog is not making sense.  So I believe I'm done here.  I think I said so a lot in this blog.  Oh well, it happens.    *~As I stand here and wait for you, you don't know how I feel.  Guess I'm too shy to let you know.  My heart's in control.  This time I know that everything will be okay.  I don't know what you would think.  I don't know what to expect.  No matter what happens you will be my friend.  I'm not going to mess this up.  I don't want to end with regrets.~Slick Shoes*

      Theres this group of kids that I suppose you would call the "hardcore" kids, and I don't have any problem with these kids, they all seem nice.  But, there is one problem.  They congregate every morning of every day for the past 2 years, and again this in and of itself is not a problem, but it becomes a problem when they congegate in front of MY locker.  Every freakin day theres like 20 of them, all leaning against or circling around my locker, which I only go to like once a day anyways.  So, I politely ask them to move, and they look at me like I'm crazy, but lets be honest, it's not a suprise I'm going to ask, I only do it EVERY DAY.  I don't know, but I've had it, these kids are gonna get it one day....You just wait.    *~These nights I get high just from breathing.  When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real, like that firework over the freeway. I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel. ~Something Corporate*

      Wow, it's amazing that when I'm so caught up in feeling bad for myself and having a pity party God kinda smacks me in the face and makes me realize how blessed I am.  Hearing that the Bakers house burnt down made me realize so quickly how much I have, and how quickly it can all be taken away.  Defiently teaches me not to take anything for granted, because God is amazing and I need to work on recognizing that more everyday.   Anyways, I guess all I can say is pray for the Bakers, because I can't even imagine what they're going through right now.    *~For all your times of laughter and every hopeful prayer, when the world weighs on your shoulders.  Your sorrow and your despair, with everything, with every breathe, praise the Lord..Let everything, let every breathe praise the Lord.~Third Day and Caemedons Call*

      Today was beautiful and awesome and I went for a run, which was so nice.  It was a fabulous day.    Tonight, I watched the presidents speech, and I started thinking about what it must be like for the people in Iraq who were listening to him, hearing that they were going to have war declared on them.  To have a leader like Saddam who kills anyone who apposes him, and has rape chambers and poision rooms to kill people, and torture chambers for anyone he thinks has turned against him.  It's really just unimaginable and I've been thinking a lot today about how blessed I am to live where I live, and that it really is such an amazing blessing, because I have more then so many of those Iraqi people could even imagine, and for no other reason besides that this is the life I was born into.  What if I was born in Iraq? I can't even imagine what it would be like to hear what they heard tonight or to live the lives they live, always being scared of getting killed or beaten or tortured.  I guess it just puts a lot of stuff into serious perspective and makes me realize how much I already have, and that I need to realize that more before always wanting more.  So I guess all thats left to do is pray like crazy.    Thats my spheel of the night, because thats what I was thinking about.      *~The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.  The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in him~Psalm 37:39-40*

      Maybe this is a little weird...but I think that this quote is awesome   "Alright, listen to me. You pull up right where she is, right. Before you get out of the car, you lock both doors. Then, you get out of the car, you walk over to her, bring her over to the car. Bring out the key, put it in the lock and open the door for her. Then you let her get in and then you close the door for her.  Then you walk around the back of the car and look through the rear window. If she doesn't reach over and lift up that button so you can get in dump her, just like that. Listen to me kid, if she doesn't reach over and lift up that button so you can get in, that means she's a selfish broad and only seen as the tip of the iceberg. You dump her and you dump her fast."   Is that weird, because it's about girls? and I am a girl? Maybe.  Anyways, it's BEAUTIFUL TODAY!!!!!!! OOOOH, go enjoy it!!

      I came home early from college visits because I didn't feel like seeing schools in Tennesse.  I'm in love with Furman though, it's gorgeous and so nice, I'm a tid bit obsessed.  When we went to North Carolina we visited our neighbors who moved there last year, and the little girl Lili, the second I get there is like "Let me show you my room!!!!" So she shows me everything in her room, then she plays the violin for me and tells me the symphonies she's memorized and tells me that her teacher is "square" What does that even mean? Did I mention this girl is in 5th grade.  She's also "Little Miss Pineville" As in, the winner of a beauty pagent, she put on her crown and sache for me.  She also has a boyfriend, named Marco, but they don't talk . Then Ted, who's in 7th grade has taken the SATs he got a 1350, and his grade avergae is a 99.53.  Isn't that nice.  Where do you get kids this smart? I don't even know.    So then I saw Furman...and loved it.....I want to go there.  On the plane right home I sat next to Jonah, who went to Harvard, and is at med school right now.  But the whole time I was talking to him I just wanted to sing the Veggie Tales song that goes "Jonah was a prophet oooh ooooh" but I didn't think he'd appreciate it.  And thats that.  Now I'm home and happy! It's nice out isn't it?? I'm going to enjoy that....  *~She's weak ya know....cause she's not strong~George* hahaha

      I'm about to leave for college visits....but I wanted to let you all (or at least the three of you that I know read this) that I'm not moving to Minnesota!!!! My mom didn't feel right about it, and she turned down the offer today.  God is so freakin awesome, that was all him right there.  Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So, yes, I'm not moving, at least not to Minnesota.  And now I go...to North Carolina, where it is presently....well 60 degrees, but it's only 10 in the morning!! Haha, ok, I'm done...have a good weekend!!!!

      So I realized today that my SAT tutor is not all human, as I had previously believed.  He is indeed part wolf, or monkey, or something.  I can't even tell you...he wore a short sleeved shirt today and he has so much arm hair, I don't even think I can explain it, it's like braidable.  I wanted to brush it or something.  I think he caught me staring at it, it was crazy.  I wonder if he's insecure about it or if it makes him feel manly....I personally thought it was a little gross.  Anyways, thats the only excitment of the day to report.  - Peace  *~The summer days are gone too soon, shoot the moon...and miss completely....~Norah Jones*

      It was so nice out today...yaaaaay for spring.  Hmm this isn't so much a funny story type blog as it is a reflection on things blog.  Are you ok with that? If not, feel free to click on the little black X in the right hand corner.  It's all good.  I was just thinking a lot today about my life this year, and how different it is.  Also how so many of the friendships that I thought would be really good, ended up falling through, and I've really found who my true friends are, and also realized that there aren't many of them.  Not that thats a bad thing, just something I've realized.  Anywho, I don't know whats going on with this me moving to Minnesota, I wish it was all resolved.   I'm really tired now.  Here I come bed....   *~We got older but we're stil young, we never grew out of this feeling that we won't, feeling that we can't, we're not ready to give up...~Starting Line*

      Last night was so much fun, all the bands were awesome and I had a really good time with Tyler and Taylor.  On the train ride there Taylor and I sat across from these twins, who were going to a twin convention in the city.  They seemed excited, they showed us their invitations and they had and how they dressed in matching outfits, even had matching fanny packs.  They were orange.  That was the train experience on the way there, then on the way home there were some girls in the seats next to us who had a little case of the munchies and potty mouth.  Some guy even told them when he was getting off the train that he thought girls from Connecticut had more class then that, because they were swearing and all.  It was kinda funny.  Anywho...I slept so late this morning, it was nice.  Now, homework, because I am a junior for 3 more months.    *~Come on let's run away and find a distant land with no gravity, let's bounce right up and down.

      Oh, it was a long week.  So glad it's over, even though there are SAT's tomorrow.  I talked to someone I haven't talked to since freshman year today, and it was sad.  I hate seeing people change so much and not for the better, but I guess I can't really do anything.  I got a lot of that restlessness goin on right now, just waiting for something to happen, and not knowing if anything will and getting impatient.  Oh well.  Anyways, I'm going to go watch the movie I rented for the evening, because I can't go out tonight.  Peace.   *~Breathe in, exhale....you know you taste like cancer~Hot Rod Circuit*

      Yesterday was fun, Sarahs puppy is sooooooooooooooooooo cute.  I want a puppy, but I want it to stay a puppy forever.  Ya know what I'm sayin.  This week has been long, and I've been having like emotional spirts.  Either super happy or super blah.  Quite interesting.  In physics today, Mr. Marrash yelled at me and Sarah Bruno, because she wouldn't let go of my thumb, because I had taken the weights we were using from her for the lab.  It was funny...but maybe you had to be there. Yeah, you probably did.  Anywho, if I were reading this blog I probably would have fallen asleep from the boringness of it already.  So if you're still awake, congratulations.  If not, well then, you're not reading this, so I am wasting my time.    *~You can sleep in your own bed tonight sleep away as summer came screaming out my name.

      Baaah, I hate school, and stupid junior year, and having so much work all the time.  I wish so badly that I could have gone to the Rangers game tonight, but no, yet again Meggie is doing work, because thats all she freakin does.  I'm not in a very good mood.  Recently I've been having serious jealousy issues....I wish I was better at being happy for people instead of getting jealous.  Oh well...just another thing to work on.  Besides that, it's the last day of my least favorite month, what a relief.

      Today Taylor and I drove around for 2 hours.  Our adventure went as follow, first, I almost crashed, but Taylor saved our lives, it was a close one though.  Then, we found a mansion, and let me tell you, this mansion literally blocked the sky.  We couldn't see the sky when we were looking at this house.  It was crazy.  There was also the blue house, everything was blue, even the mailbox.  A little weird.  Anywho, we kept driving and we were in Tokeneke somewhere, and Taylor was gazing out the window and saw a dead swan.  She made me turn around to see it, then we turned around one more time, because we couldn't see its head, and we needed to know if it was decapitated.  It was really funny...in a strange...slightly morbid way....That was our adventure, then we got a turkey sandwhich from Uncles, picked up Tyler at the library, and went to club.  The sky was really pretty tonight too, I hope you all got to see it.  Tomorrow is the last day before break, anyone else really happy? Yeah.    Ok now I'm just going to share some lyrics, and a quote that I stole from my sister...and I like them all alot, and they make me think.  It's nice.    "Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens." J. R. R. Tolkien   "Am I at the point of no improvement? What of the death I still dwell in? I try to excel, but I feel no movement. Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?  Never underestimate my Jesus. You're telling me that there's no hope. I'm telling you your wrong.  Never underestimate my Jesus When the world around you crumbles He will be strong, He will be strong  I throw up my hands "Oh, the impossibilities" Frustrated and tired Where do I go from here? Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear  I think I can't, I think I can't But I think you can, I think you can I think I can't, I think I can't But I think you can, I think you can Gather my insufficiencies and place them in your hands, place them in your hands, place them in your hands" - Relient K   A part of myself, before you were Lord I hold nothing back, 'cause to you less is more And may these words on my heart on my lips, Somehow mean so much more than this  Jesus, I pray Just know what I'm tryin' to say  "Jesus, I plead Please purify me Make my heart clean Drench me with your mercy Jesus, I pray I love you, I need you For the rest of my days I swear I will seek you To the best of my ability I'm practicing humility And I lay myself before 'Cause less is more." - Relient K   Yeah, those 2 songs are so good.  Definetly what I needed to hear.  Bed time.  Night night.  Dream about bunnies.

      This week has not been so fun, so much work.  But today I got to babysit for Wil, and we all know he's my favorite.  And he made the week 20 times better.  He is the funniest three year old I've ever met.  Other then that I've been having such good God time this week....the Bible is the bomb, but I don't have enough time to go into that now..instead, I'd like to share my experience trying to give Wil a nap.   "Ok Wil, lets be quiet and take a nap" So we're quiet for a little..lying in Wils new big boy bed.  Wil turns to me and is all " So lets talk about club.  Where is it now? What do you do there?" So I tell him that it's at the Depot and we sing and have skits and all that.  He is momentarily satisfied and continues to squirm while I try to get him to sleep.  After 10 minutes or so of me scratching his back in return for him lying still he says "It's too much scratching" so that he doesn't have to lie down anymore.  SO  then he turns to me and goes. "So, lets start over.  Where were we.  Oh yeah, talking about club.  Now, where is it?" Oh man...this kid is funny....

      Snow, what the freakin crap.  Not a fan right here.  Yesterday I told my brother that he needs to learn to put the toilet seat up, because he never does, and he pee's all over the seat.  So I told him he needs to put the seat up, and he replies with, " Why don't the girls learn to put the seat up when they're done? Why do guys have to pick it up and put it down? I'm not conforming to this sexist oppresion." He's 12.    *~Theres an emptiness inside her and shed do anything to fill it in.  But all the colors mix together - to grey.  And it breaks her heart~DMB*

      Break is almost over.  But I don't think it went by that fast, I began reflecting yesterday when the kids got home from Georgia (so weird) and the town is inhabited again by people.  It's strange, I don't really know how to explain it, so maybe I won't.  I just went running, and now my mom is making me go grocery shopping, what am I the slave? Seriously people.

      I got my prom dress today, a nice trip to the city with my mommy, she's so nice sometimes.  Artie and Booth dressed up like the easter bunny tonight, I'm not ok with that...at all.   Now I'm tired, and tomorrow is Friday, I still can't decide if break went by quickly or slowly.  It's all mixing together in my head.  Maybe thats because I'm sleepy, I'm going to go to bed.  Night night.    ARski56:  i dunno cuz i just picture you with this grin on your face like, "im good, i can take it, aint no stupid easter bunnies gonna scare meggie"  word.

      I don't think my car will ever be clean.  There is crap stuck in the windshield wipers, and in other random places.  Unfortunately I alreaday spent 20 bucks on Sunday to get it washed....and the 3 dollar Texaco car wash is not so hot.  I knew it was a bad idea.    It's so nice out today, I think I'm going to go sit outside.

      Mmmm Krispy Kreme.....sorry my blogs are so short, theres really just nothing interesting to post about.  Except Krispy Kreme mmmmmmmm......  " Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. " 1 Cor. 13 4-8

      Last night was fun.....and now, everyone is gone.  I'm sitting at home, I have a feeling this is what the greater part of my vacation will be like.  I wish I knew how to get to Taco Bell...because I really want some, but I don't know how to get there. Grrrr......vacation will be interesting.  I hope I don't die of boredom.

      I forgot to mention that on Easter we had dinner with the Hirsches, who are the proud parents of Micheal, my first ever ever crush.  We used to have sleepovers when we were little, and I thought he was cute when it was bad to think boys were cute.  So needless to say Micheal has a soft spot in my heart, and he's still quite good looking. Easter dinner was much enjoyed.    Taylor, Baskin Robins? What?

      ATTENTION: All girls at DHS, LEARN TO WEAR CLOTHES!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry, but today I saw way too much of too many girls, and it was so gross.  Have some decency girls, put on some clothes.     Anyways, now that I got that out, on to more interesting things.  Today I went to Greenwhich for a dermatoligist appointment, and I got so lost.  I actually drove right by the place on my first try, and I knew where it was, but I was really spacing out and just went right by it.  The nice thing about Greenwhich ave is that it's one way...yeah.  So I just started driving, in the direction that I thought would get me back to the top of the ave.  It took quite a while but I finally got back to the top, and I did not miss the turn.  THEN came the issue of parking.  I tried to just sneak into the parking lot next door but they had like a parking lot gaurd, so that failed.  Then I found staff parking...and I thought maybe I could just sneak in, but the only spot was this one that had a curb on one side a wall in front and a wall to the side...after much manuvering I fit the car into it, and then realized, that Meggie...when you're parked against a wall, it generally doesn't move so that you can open the door.  SOOOOO I had to park somehwere else.  Alas, I found a nice little parallel parking spot a little bit down the street and up another street.  All this to get part of my foot chopped off.  OOOOOWWWWWW, it hurt so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I have a hole in my foot, but it's kinda cool, maybe cool in the same way a dead swan is funny.  Then on the way home I was stuck in traffic, and in a lot of pain, but I was listening to Kirk Franklin and so I started dancing in my car...alone....to gospel music.  It was quite fun.  People were laughing at me, and one guy didn't even try and hide the fact that he was laughing at me, he turned around, stuck his head out the window, and then laughed.  It made me laugh too.  Anyways, thats the extent of my exciting day.  Then I did homework.....yeah, I do that a lot.  I'm done.

      Happy Easter! This marks the one year anniversary of the start of my first blog.  Happy Birthday blog blog.  So break was interesting.  It was really long, at least looking back on it it seems like it went on forever.  Some things are different now too.  I've been really moody lately, and really anti-social.  It's not very good, I don't like being around people ever.  I'm not saying that I don't like my friends, I don't know, I know my sister understands, because she knows when I get all not liking being around people, it's because I hate talking about myself.  I think a lot of things are just changing around me and inside me, and I'm thinking a lot, so being around people I guess like gets in the way of me figuring out whats going on.  I don't think that makes sense.  But oh well, it's my blog.  So now we're in the home stretch til summer.  This year was so crazy....it was really good and really bad at the same time, I'll be greatful for summer.  2 months to the day.  Summer will be awesome.  I already decided.  I'm going to go enjoy this last evening of vacation and pretend there is no school tomorrow.  Happy Easter!! Jesus rose!!!!   I really really like this song, so it's my whole quote~   As I leave here today, apartment 108 I'll always keep you in my heart. Anderson is cold tonight, The leaves are scattered on the ground. I miss the seasons, And the comfort of your smile.  Sometimes this all feels like a dream. I'm waiting for someone to just wake me up, From this life.  As I look out at these fairgrounds, I remember how our family split apart. I don't think I ever told you, But I know you always did your best. And the hard times, They only made us stronger.  As I sit here all alone, I wonder how I'm suppose to carry on when you're gone. I'll never be the same without you,  I love you more then you will ever know. So maybe now you finally know. Sometimes we're helpless and alone, But you can let it keep you weighted down. You must go on.  Do you ever feel like crying? Do you ever feel like giving up? I raise my hands up towards the sky, I say this prayer for you tonight, Because nothing is impossible.  As I sit here all alone, I wonder how I'm suppose to carry on when you're gone. I'll never be the same without you,  I love you more then you will ever know. So maybe now you finally know. Sometimes we're helpless and alone, But you can let it keep you weighted down. You must go on.  (The hardest part isn't finding who we need to be, it's being content with who you are.)  Stay who you are. You must go on. Stay who you are.  - The Ataris "The Hero Dies in This One"

      Today I backed my car into Sarah Maddoxs car, and you know what that means? That means I suck.  At least there wasn't really damage, but man I feel like the worst driver ever.  I'm going to be captain cautious from now on.  That was probably one of the worst feelings ever.  Besides that my day was pretty uneventful, when I went running this morning (yes Bren, I went) this lawn truck drove by, and one guy stuck his head out the window to stare at me.  I didn't enjoy that.  Anyways, I have a lot of work to do, and this was just a means of procrastonating.  I also took Stacy to the vet, she had to have her butt checked, haha.  Silly dog.  Ok well I'm done, for those of you who read this, if you could pray for my mom, she really needs to find a job, and it's bummin her out big time.  Now I have to go and think up answers to DBQs wooohoooooo.....  I know these lyrics are from Christina Aguleria, but lets look past that ok.  I like the song, I'll admit it.  You wanna fight about it?   "Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through  so I wanna say thank you  Cause it makes me that much stronger Makes me work a little bit harder It makes me that much wiser So thanks for making me a fighter Made me learn a little bit faster Made my skin a little bit thicker It makes me that much smarter So thanks for making me a fighter"

      I haven't blogged for a while...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to neglect you blog blog.  This weekend was fun, and it's so nice out right now.  Booth shot me with one of those stupid guns last night, and I had gone so long without ever getting shot, I was bitter.  I am so hyper right now, I don't think I can sit here anymore.  But I just have to say, that God is totally amazing, and I love him so much.  hjagurb ahjgklgh!    " When I close my eyes and think of you And reminisce on all the things you do I can't imagine my life without you It's like paradise now I know that it's real (um) It's a mystery for someone to give their life just for me What you did on calvary Makes me wann love you more  I never knew I could be so happy And I never knew I'd be so secure because of your love Life has brand new meaning It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day~Kirk Franklin*

      Well, my brain hurts.  Today was such a nice day, I love nice weather, and that it's almost June, which means so many good things I could cry.  The impossible, ridiculous Junior year is almost over, I can't wait.  It's funny when I'm so oblivious to things, and I only realize things that I want to realize, I'm a little stubborn I guess.  Anyways, I'm listening to this song that I found on my computer, I don't know who downloaded it, but it's by Justincase, and the name of the band alone makes me ashamed, but it's good, I'm such a loser.

      Train of thought this afternoon after studying history for 4 hours... - Nicholas Biddle was in charge of the National Bank, Biddle sounds like piddle.  - I check my mail and theres something from agnew something or other....Agnew was Nixons vice president.  - Burr and Hamilton were like two little girls duking it out, the biggest cat fight I've ever heard of.   - The south was the biggest hick town ever, and thats where the name cracker originated, my ap book even told me so.   - I bet there wouldn't have been so much trouble in the government if we had gotten public education going a little sooner.  - Those utopian societies were just an excuse to have a lot of sex.  - William Henry Harrison should have known to wear a warm coat during his inaguration speech, he knew how long it'd be, and maybe he wouldn't have died a month later from pneumonia.   - Tyler was so bitter by the end of his term that he annexed Texas, and started a war.    I have problems.

      Last night was fun, first we broke the fast, which was nice, but by then my hunger had kinda just gone away.  Then Taylor and I drove around listening to Kirk, because we are cool like that, and then went to my house where we watched some Lizzie McGuire, Sorority life, and male volleyball.  It was nice.  After that Boofus and Artie called and we went and picked them up, and George joined us.  We went to McDonalds, where Taylor tried to spit in the bathroom and missed the sink, I think that what she said at least, she was laughing really hard about it.  THEN George decided to go home, and we headed to Baskin Robins, where much to Taylor and my dismay, our boyfriends were not.  Sigh....but alas we got ice cream, and Taylor and I decided to be devious, and we ran out while Boof and Artie were ordering, got in my car, moved it to the end of the lot, and hid it behind another car, and then waited.  Oh it was so funny when they came out, all sad and distressed, thinking we had abandoned them at Baskin Robins.  They saw the car though and ran towards us, Taylor and I tried to hide but it didn't work.  So then we tried to drive away, but they stood behind the car, and then sat on the car.  It was all very amusing.  But maybe you had to be there.  Then Taylo went home, and I love her.  We were bored, and had eaten a lot, so we went to the church playground, which is one of my favorite places, and I hope you all saw the sky last night because there were about 2584305766754865695 stars, and it was so pretty.  Anyways, that was my night, and I just put it ALL here, and if you read that, I'm impressed, because I did it in order to put off studying for history.  BLAH! haha nooo klgh laf ok...bye.

      My daddy just told me a story about when he was in high school (we were talking about prom, and he was making sure I wasn't going to marry Boofus) and he went to a dance with this really good looking girl, and there was this guy who was the mayor of Bostons son, who went to his high school, and it was lke his 3rd senior year or something.  And he got a new convertible, that he brought to the dance, and he left the dance with my daddies date.  Then my dad went on to say, "But there is a God in heaven because justice was later served.  He became a homosexual" I have the craziest daddy you will ever meet.    " Good things come easily and good things go.

      So I guess it'd be nice if I could understand at least the littlest bit of whats going on in my life right now, but I guess God is all about keeping me in the dark, so I just have to roll with it.  Whatever, at least he's the one in control and not me, it's much better that way.  I quoted this the other day, but it really doesn't get old, and it's the best advice ever.

      I have three things that I want to blog about today.    At least 8 times a day I see Mrs. Koontz in her yellow jacket walking her dogs, but the thing is, she always carries one.  Now, I always wonder, does she carry this one dog because it's sick? Because it's lazy? Because she likes it more then the other dog? I wonder this every time I see her,  maybe one day I will ask her why she always carries this one dog, maybe it can't hack the walking 6095435 times a day.  I wonder if the other dog gets jealous, I bet it would, but it probably is in better shape then the other dog.    Today during my history final, I'm almost done with the awful thing and I hear laughing in the hall, I look up and look out the window on the door, and Taylor and Artie are doing jumping jacks outside the door trying to get my attention.  They start doing all this stuff to try and make me laugh, and it was so hard not to laugh.  At one point I was pinching my lips to keep myself from laughing, finally they left.  But wait, they came back, with a sign, and then they crumpled the sign and threw it at eachother, then Artie broke his necklace, I thought Mr.Clarke was going to see me and kill me.  To my relief, he didn't.    I went to the mall to get a bra for prom, and the woman at Vickies when I was buying it gives me this look, and then takes the bra.  After she rings it up she's all "Don't fold this bra, you'll ruin the seamless affect."   I had had the bra folded on the table.  She was pretty agressive about it, and I wanted to be like "Whatever it's my bra" but I didn't.  Now I'm done.    "You don't do it on purpose  But you make me shake Now I count the hours 'til you wake With your babies breath Breathe symphonies Come on sweet catastrophe  Maybe this time I can follow through  I can feel complete Stop paying dues Stop the rain from falling Keep my oceans calm This time I know nothings wrong" - Something Corporate....I really don't ever get sick of that song....

      Taylor and I just had a nice long talk about our future husbands, and Taylor wants to marry a mathametician.  What a weirdo, she really wants to too.  I told her that at night he would whisper things like "2 + 3 = 5" while she falls asleep, who wants to marry a mathamatician? I want to marry a doctor, mmhhhmmm   "Be still, and know that I am God." - Psalm 46:10

      Blog, I feel like I keep ignoring you.  I am sincerely sorry, you don't deserve to be ignored.  I am blogging now because I was supposed to go see my sister, but my mom won't let me drive, but all my friends think I'm away, so I have no friends.  Yesterday in physics Mr. Marrash was setting up this problem for us on the board and he says, "I'll do the first 33 % for you, and you have to do the remaining 66%." So my whole class starts laughing a little bit, and then Nick Rongo or whatever his last name is raises his hand and says "Just curious Mr. Marrash, who's going to do the other 1%?" Oh the joys of a teacher with dislexia or however you spell it.  Taylor and I got in a fake fight yesterday at the Van Sciver house hold, and we thought everyone knew it was a fake fight, and so we were going on about it for like 2 hours while they all tried to repair our friendship, and then we found out later from Artie, who put the most effort into repairing the "lost friendship" that they thought we were serious.  Whoops.  It was funny.  I AM SO BORED.  Oh man, Im going to go find some entertainment or something.  BLAH.  haha  "Hate is excess baggage" - American History X

      Blog blog, I am sorry, I neglected you for 3 days.  You didn't deserve that, I'm sorry.  Prom was so much fun, Boofus was the best date ever.  Then after the dance post prom was kinda dumb, but we went to a diner, and on the way I stepped on Sarah Brunos foot and almost killed her, and then getting out of the limo she slammed my fingers in the door, it was kinda funny.  Watching the sun not really rise was fun, and kishe and bacon was so good for breakfast, bahaha, kishe and bacon.  I had a very good time.  In fact, I have to go pick up my pictures, but I will leave you with some of the best quotes of the night.    " Going over the speed bumps is going to be a little rough, but you're just going to have to take it like a champion." - Stinch.  " Lots and lots and lots and lots of pillooooowwwwws" - Artie  " I just farted in Sarahs butt" - Taylor " Leader of the pack...vrooooom vrooooooom." -Stinch and Keith  Then, general highlights include Rottner being in the bathroom when they announced he was prom king, Stinch and Taylor going jogging at 4:30 to keep themselves awake, Dustin not coming back to the limo...I thought that was funny....yeah, it was a fun night.

      Today in physics, I was talking to Mr. Marrash, and telling him that I wouldn't be in class tomorrow, and Carly found that it was the appropriate time to inform the entire class that I am not only skinny, I have a great butt.  At this point, the entire class looked at my butt.  And I wonder why physics is my favorite class.  I'm off to see my sister graduate.  Have a good day!

      HELLLLLLLO.  A minute ago, I had a good reason to blog, and now that I am finally on my blog, I don't remember what it was.  There was a thunder storm today, that made me very happy.  Summer is a hop skip and a jump away, but then that means applying for college, oh what the crap, I'm still a freshman.  Ok, well I don't remember what I was going to say.  But I can tell you a funny story in the mean time.  Today I was supposed to make up a physics lab, so I go during my free and Mr.Marrash gives me all the stuff that I have to do, and I sit down and start reading the lab, then I realize I have no idea how to do it, and so I pretend to start setting it up, and then Mr. Marrash leaves the room, so I put all the stuff away really quickly, took the lab sheet, and booked it out of the room.  I figure that if the rest of the class has already done it I can just get some help from them.  Was that funny? I'm not sure.  I'm done here.  Tash, I love you.

      You know sometimes when you're just ready for things to change.  Yeah, I'm defiently feeling that right now, it just seems like everything is always the same and nothing new ever happens.  I'm kinda sick of things being the way they are, and I just want something new.  Hopefully summer will bring something exciting or different, I think I feel stuck right now, and it keeps bummin me out, and I'm tired of that crap.  Anyways, thats whats been on my mind recently, at least today.  If you know anything new and exciting and want to share it with me go for it.

      Taylors home!!!! YAY!!!! That's very exciting.  Anyways, I think it stopped raining, wouldn't that be nice.  This is me putting off writing a paper. La. La. La. La. La.  I was just reading my old blog, and I'm going to post an old entry here, because it was funny.    Look! I'm posting!!! YAY! Thats exciting. Today, I went to church ce matin and then I went to bible study, one after another. Lots of time at church, but both were good. I got home and Amanda had called, so I went over to her house and hung out. Wes and Pete were swimming and Kyle and I went out to visit them and then Kyle tried to push me in the pool, I don't really remember what happened but I know that I was almost in the pool and thinking about how badly I didn't want to go in, so I grabbed onto the closest thing, which just happened to be Kyles hair. I was pulling it so hard just trying to not fall in, and then I realized that it was Kyles hair, and it probably was hurting her, so I pulled extra hard to get up and ran past her inside. She ran in after me and told the boys so Kyle, Matt and Goat grabbed me and with much effort (because I'm huge and put up a good fight) threw me into the pool. Wasn't that nice. Later when I took my shorts off to put them in the dryer Goat stole them and the boys procceeded to play catch with them in the pool, Matt even put them on. Then Goat threw them into the Gallos yard. So I had to walk soaking wet with no shorts over to the Gallos to get my shorts. Don't my friends love me. Out of love I have for my friends, I'm using Amanda as my quote for the day.  *~Can you ask them to get a towel and do it on the floor?~Amanda*  Oh good times, I love those kids.  Peace out.

      I know that I just blogged, about 1 minute ago.  But I decided to check a blog that I have not checked for quite a while, and found that there was a new post, well if mid may is new..then it was new.  Nonetheless, there was a comment made which I will post here, that was refering not very discretly to me, let me share:  "I want to marry a mathematician I've decided... if any of you have a problem with that... (by any of you I mean a certain someone who wants to marry a doctor or some crap like that), then you can just shaddup. "   This was in refrence to my desire to marry a doctor, much better than a mathematician.  And I feel called to list the reasons why in order to do the exact opposite of "shaddup"ing, and to put this person in their place.  So, here I go.   1.) Doctors are smart, and care about people.  2.) Scrubs are the coolest clothing ever.  3.) If you were sick, you wouldn't even have to leave your house.  None of that sitting in the waiting room crap, the doctor is already there.  4.) You'd have the healthiest kids in town.  5.) Doctors are people people, which means they are friendly, and who doesn't want a friendly husband.  6.) Mathematicians are dorks, doctors are compitent and neato.  7.) Doctors have some sort of strange charm about them, mathematicians probably smell, figuring that they get all excited about numbers, work up a sweat, and then don't shower.   I think that is ample proof that a doctor is clearly the better choice, and this person has no clue what they are talking about.  I am done.

      So just to review, the other day my mom has lunch with Larry Cudlow, or something like that, he's this big news anchor man on msnbc or something, but apparently he and my mom are old friends.  My sister is dating the son of the man who owns Rolling Stones Magazine, Mens Journal, and US Weekly.  She's flying out on the family jet to their ranch in Idaho for the 4th of July.  What the crap, is this really my family? I think I'm the reject.    "Freeze the frame, memorize it. Take the mistakes and don't go back to where we've always been.

      Blog Blog Blog.  Hello.  I missed you.  My sister graduated, she was fabulous, I love her.  I am putting off work right now, because if I succeed in putting it off for another 10 minutes then I don't have to do it before Holy Ground, but in all reality, I am just screwing myself over so badly.  I have so much work to do. Shall I tell you the work? Ok.  First, I have to finish this book, A Prayer for Owen Meany, I have precisely 497 pages left.  Then, I have 2 essays for english that are due next Monday, each of which need to be about 6 pages.  Following that, I have this history project, I should do that.  Next, Physics.  I have 9 school days to learn a whole semester worth of information.  And a test Wednsday on the stuff we're doing right now.  Somewhere in there I have an oral French exam, but I'm not really sure where.  And what am I doing? Blogging.  Thats right folks, blogging.  What a failure.    In other news, you know what is stupid, worrying.  Worrying and trying to control things, it never does anything.  Trusting God is the only thing that ever solves anything, he has defiently taught me that.  Last but not least, I just arrived home, and what does my sister inform me of? Oh, thats right...my mom went to Chicago without telling me.  Bye mommy love you too.  Crazy business.   "In a world that is unwhole, you have got to fight, just to keep your soul.

      Baah, I just finished my worst exam, and did my history presentation, and I have no finals Monday.  This, is a good feeling.  Physics was so bad, but it's over, so I don't care.  And in history, I did my whole presentation, and it was the full 20 minutes, and then Mr. Clarke starts asking me these questions that I didn't know the answers to, and it was very scary.  But like I said, it's all over and done with, and with that, so is most of junior year, how incredibly nice.  Now I just have to find a college that will let me go there.  My work is never done.    " Because the last thing that I need is somebody like you, to push me around and tell me what to do.  I know theres a time and a place where you can call the shots but it's not here.  Cause I poured my heart into, the last three years of wonderin what I should do, should I cash this check and trade in what I thought I knew.  Your promises don't help to make it easier " - Allister

      Well, I hate school.  I want it to be over so badly, but in order for it to be over there is so much I have to do.  Like a history project, and this english book, I've got about 350 pages to read for Thursday. Crap.  But I have had fun putting off all the work.  Let me share my experience from yesterday...Artie and I were bored, and we decided to stalk Booth, because he wasn't home yet and he was going to hang out with Taylor when he did arrive home.  So Artie and I, being stealth like we are, go to Booths and hide my car across the street, then we leave little anonymous love notes on his bed and light a candle and turn on Norah Jones, then we hear him pulling in, so we jump in the closet, where we hide and wait for his arrival.  Boofus comes into his room and automatically assumes that Artie is there somewhere, and opens the closet, and finds Artie, but not me.  He is not extremely amused, but he and Artie talk a little, while I'm still hiding, because I had been specifically instructed by Artie to not come out if he was found, and then the dreaded words come from Booths mouth, "Get out I have to get naked."  Um....I was in the closet, and Artie willingly leaves the room knowing this.  So here I am, stuck in Booths closet, while he's getting naked.  I've never had such an awkward situation in my life.  The worst was when he opened the closet, and it got stuck against my leg, but I was too scared to look, man, it was rough.  Long story short, I was eventually discovered, but Booth was fully clothed by then.  Phew.    " I want to love and hate you all the time.  It's times like this that I'd like to tell you things are better.  It's eyes like yours that give impressions you don't listen." - Keepsake

      Blog, have I been ignoring you? I'm sorry if you feel neglected.  I took the SATs this weekend, and it was really quite funny.  I don't know why I thought they were so funny, but I did, I probably got a 240 combined.  One question was Pedestrian is to Original as blank is to blank...what the crap? Is there any connection between being a pedestrian and being original? I think not.  Anyways, we only have 4 days of actual school left, woohoooo!! Oh, it is exciting.   I don't really have anything to blog about, but I wanted my blog to know that I love it.  I love you blog blog.

      Happy summer.   "There must be something wrong with me I won't stop taking chances It's nothing to do with apathy I can't take no for an answer Give me a reason Why do I do it? Would you believe it If I told you a lie? Give me a reason How could I do it? The truth isn't easy That much I can't deny The question still remains the same On who can I place all the blame? The demons, devils of the world Or is it only myself? There is something definitely wrong With all of us It would take a miracle of God To make things right There is something wrong here With all of us... The answer lies in front of me Confirmed by God's own Spirit It's in the pages that I read How could I ever deny it?"  - Third Day

      So yesterday was the last day of finals and afterward Taylor, Booth, Artie and I were hanging out at my house.  Booth and I are sitting over the garage and out of nowhere Taylor and Artie come running up the stairs and apparently, are fighting.  Not verbally fighting, more like "I'm going to beat the crap out you" fighting.  But there was no real anger.  Nonetheless, they went at it, and not that I don't love Taylor or support her cause...Artie beat the crap out of her.  He gave her the worst typewritter I've ever seen. It was one of the funniest/saddest things I've ever seen.  Anyways, somehow water got involved, and then Booth and I got involved...and it turned into a full fledged water fight, inside my house.  It started over the garage, went downstairs to the kitchen...where at one point I had to answer the phone, and while trying to be civil on the phone Booth pulls the back of my pants open and dumps a glass of water down my pants.  Then it went upstairs where Artie, who was soaking, threatened to jump on my bed if anyone poured more water on him.  Taylor chucked a glass at him, thanks Taylor.  So Artie jumps on my bed, and I jump after him trying to get him off, which in turn only makes my bed wetter. Then, the dreaded words, "MEGGIE!!!!!" comes from downstairs.  Uh oh, Dad's home.  We had to clean up and ship out so fast.  My entire house was soaking, as were all of us except for Booth, who somehow avoided it.    Later that night, at Booths, Artie and I fought, and I guess I could pretend that I won, but if we're all honest here, he beat the crap out of me too.  It went down in Booths room, and my head hit so many walls, and the floor so many times.  But don't think that I didn't get in a couple good hits, and if you see Artie, ask if you can see his back.  The end came though when I got thrown against the part of the wall that sticks out, and yeah, my back hurt a little.  Here's a rundown on the injuries I sustained... 1.) Huge bruise on elbow/swollen elbow.  2.) 3 bruises on right forearm. 3.) 2 bruises on left forearm.  4.) Swollen lump on back.  5.) 3 bruises on left leg.  6.) 4 bruises on right leg.   7.) 1 bruise on chest from an attempt at a typewriter.  8.) Bruised/really really sore left shoulder.   9.) 2 eggs...1 on my forehead, and one on the back of my head.  10.)  A bruise on the back of my neck.    Bahahaha, thats so funny.  I got the crap kicked out of me, and by a guy.  But I think I should let you all know that before last night Artie has never hit a girl, and he never intends to again.  He feels extremely bad.  Haha, I think it's funny.  Oh yeah, one last thing....I spit on him too, that was really funny.   "We need to focus on the things above cuz the things below will never fill us up" - Pax 217

      I have been in the best mood ever since Sunday, and it has made the past few days so nice.  Today I took my math final, and for not studying, it went really well.  Then Angie called me and she had suddenly gotten really sick and asked me if I would watch Wil.  Of course I said yes, because I love the child, and he and I had good times.  Little trip to McDonalds, little trip to Food Emporium or however the butt you spell it.  Good times.  Hmmmm french and english finals tomorrow, should I break the not studying trend and study? No, I think not.  This time tomorrow is basically summer...let's take a moment and enjoy that.......................ok good job.  Now, I'm going to go, and do nothing, but theres nothing else for me to blog about.    Quote from Wil,  "Look I found a worm....oh, I think the worm broke.

      Today I didn't have any finals and it was so nice.  Sarah Lecueyer and I chazilled, and had good times.  Other than that Stacey killed a chipmunk and left it on the porch, and I didn't see it and stepped on its head, how incredibly unpleasant.  Ughhggh gross.  I got my car washed too, and for some reason the guy gave it to me for free, when it should have been 20 bucks.  I'm not complaining.  Yeah...I have a math final tomorrow, but who studies for those? Clearly I don't.  Maybe I should though, so I don't fail.  Because that would be bad.  Ok, I'm out like the fat kid in dodgeball.    "Do what will make God happy, do what you feel is right.

      Ok so I didn't have anything to do today, because I don't have any finals tomorrow and who studies two days in advanced for math finals.  Anyways, I did a lot of thinking about this year and about my relationship with God and just my life in general, and I realized so many things.  And, like always, this is my blog, and I can write whatever I want in it, and I want to write about the things I realized, because I feel like God just revealed so much to me, and right now I'm just so amazed by Him.    First I was thinking about how easily I've been distracted by the most worthless and temporary things that this world has to offer, and how I've let them become my focus, and because of that my focus has moved from God, and that leads to my feelings of want and the lack of content that comes from not focusing on God.  I realized that for some reason it seems so important to find acceptance or identity with worldy things or people, but it never seems to fill us because as soon as we feel like we're whole or accepted, things change, and we're left searching again.  That's because that fulfillment that we so desperately want can't come from anything on this earth, and only God can give us that. He is the only one who can make us whole, and give us our true identity in Christ.  It's when we loose sight of that that the obsession with worldly things becomes our focus, and inevitably leaves us more empty than when we began.  And in denying God the chance to fill that void because I'm trying to fill it on my own, I know that I've been denying myself the life that God has offered me, and I haven't been true to myself.  So after realizing this, I gave it all up...everything that had been bringing me down - away from God and away from being true to myself - and I don't really know why of all things I'm blogging about this, but I guess I'm just trying to find a way to explain the feeling of peace and fullness that I feel right now, and I know it's there because I let go of all that stupid temporary stuff, and I let go of trying to fill myself with it and realized that there's nothing I can do apart from God to make my life full, and when I realized that He rushed in to fill every gap in me.  I also realized that I'm never going to find my worth in any type of thing on earth, so why even bother with those things that I thought would make me who I am.  God makes me who I am, not being accepted by certain people, and not having everything Iwant. I guess I just really realized for the first time what it means to be true to God and true to myself in my faith in him, and in that I've felt God in one of the most powerful ways ever, and I'm rambling, so I should probably stop now.  But all I can say is that God is incredible, and I love Him so much.    "Therefore we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.  For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." - 2 Cor. 4:16  "I'll be all you need, close your eyes and just believe." - Dave Barnes   "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.  I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have lenty.  I have learned the secret of being content, in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.  I can do everything through Him who gives me strength" - Phil. 4: 11-13

      Dum a de dum a de dum...I have no exams tomorrow, and nothing to do!! Oh that's exciting.  This weekend has been quite nice.  Right now I'm pretty bored, because everyone else has exams tomorrow so no one can hang out with me....Oh well, I guess it happens.  Do da do da do...Yeah, I'm prettttty bored.  Hopefully my sister will come home soon with the car and then at least I can drive around and be bored.  My life is so exciting.  I'm probably making you dumber by the moment, I'm sorry.    On a completely other note, really letting go of things, and moving on, is so nice.  Yeah, it takes a long time sometimes, but I know that I've grown so much, and God doesn't allow things to happen without working his greater good in them, and I know he has.  Sorry if that doesn't make sense to anyone, but this is my blog, and it feels so good to be able to honestly say that I am past something that was holding me back for so long.

      Blog Blog!! Hello!!!   Today was a fun filled day.....it started quite early this morning, when my mom knocked on my door, I was deep in slumber, and she announces to me that I have a visitor, and in walks Arthur Richard Van Sciver.  He rode his bike to my house to wake me up.  So, after a while, I get out of bed, and we made Belgain waffles for breakfast, mmmmm yum.  Then we trecked to Booths to bring him leftovers, which he didn't want.  That stung a little.  Anywho, then we went out on Arties boat to find his family at Lloyds Island, where we chazilled for a while, and Booth smushed a strawberry in my bathing suit bottom - not fun.  That was about the end of that, so we came home.   The worst part of the day was probably when Booth and Artie tried to kill my teddy bear, we won't get into details, but it was bad news.    Did I mention recently that I love summer? Because it is so nice.  It's going by too fast though, I don't want to go to volleyball camp.  It's going to take up so much stinkin time. Baah.  Oh well, we will not think about that now.  I'm hungry.  So I'm going to tend to that.    " Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?

      Blog, I'm sorry.  Summer has caused me to neglect you.  I didn't mean to.  But here I am now.  I have a story to tell too.  2 days ago, I was at Wallus Booth Greenes baseball game, and this kid, considering it was baseball and all, hit a ball, and it went straight at the pitcher.  It bounced on the mound and then sounded like the pitcher caught the ball, which was clearly not the case when the pitcher started screaming.  The ball hit him in the eye, and I wish I could tell you the sound it made...well, I'll try...you know the sound of a catcher catching a ball? Yeah.  Thats what it sounded like when the ball hit his eye.  OOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW!!!!! That sound is going to stick with me for a while.     I decided recently that I'm not going to care what people think or say about me, especially when their opinions are based on one-sided facts or ideas.  If someone wants to form opinions about me but isn't going to take the time to come to me and ask for my side of something, then I don't care what they think.  Because people that make judgements and opinions on crap like that aren't worth the time.  To some of the few of you who read my blog that may sound very random, but to  some of you I think it makes sense, and I just wanted to put it out there - if you want to hear the whole story, or more than one side of it because you're going to form an opinion - I'm willing to tell my side, but don't judge me before hearing it.  Sorry if that was rude or whatever, but I don't like hearing the things people who only know one side say and I don't like people telling me or other people that I'm wrong when they don't take the time to talk to me.  And thats the end of that.    " We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live " -switchfoot

      woah, new blog format.  freakin me out a little bit.  I go away for a week and this is what happens....a few deep breathes and I should be ok.  wooooh.  Anyways, Creation was absolutely without a doubt incredible.  God showed himself in the most powerful ways, and changed me in ways I didn't even know were possible.  So awesome.  And all the music and speakers were so good, and yeah, so good.  I'm sorry that Creation meant neglecting you for a week blog blog, I missed you.  I'm glad to be back, and now you're all spiffed up.  It will take some getting used to though.  Hmmm, my life is pretty boring.  I have hot tan lines, if you want to see them just ask, I'm quite willing to show.  My flip flop one is my favorite.  Yeah, it's summer, and I think it finally hit me today on the way home when I was thinking about how when I got home I would have to start my homework because there was school tomorrow, and then I realized that there wasn't, and it was amazing.  I'm blabbering on, and now I'll stop.    "Stop complaining move along open your eyes and see what's going on.  We need to get back to the ways of the days of old.

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRENNY!!!!!!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!     For those of you who don't know, it's Brens 18th Birthday.  SO, this blog is dedicated to her, on her birthday.  Happy  Birthday Bren.  :o)   Tonight I went bowling with Taylor, Keith, Mike, Bryan, Bebuckle, Artie, and Justin Shaw, as in Taylors 10 year old brother.  It was very good times.  Justin rode shotgun in my car, we talked about telescopes.  I feel a new bond forming.  Anyways, I just had 2 chocolate chip cookies, from the box of cookies Charmaine purchased from Stop and Shop today, and they were so good.  I would eat more, but that would probably mean I was fat.  So maybe I shouldn't.  I just realized that my sister was asleep on the couch, and for the past 10 minutes I've been sitting here being like "what the crap is she watching?" because theres the weirdest show on tv, and so I turned to give her a weird look, but alas, her eyes are shut, and it's possible she's even drooling.  If you couldn't tell...I don't have anything interesting to blog about.  But I felt I owed it to my blog to blog.  Especially because I'm leaving technically tomorrow, and I won't get to blog for 10 whole days.  Ooooh blog blog, I'll miss you.    Right.  I think I'm done now.   Goodnight.

      Tonight, Booth, Taylor and myself took a trip to Shaws, where we each bought a pint of yummy ice cream.  Then, we each proceeded to eat a pint of ice cream each.  I consumed 1200 calories in one sitting.  Taylor consumed 1240.  It was absolutely fabulous.

      ello.  I think summer has messed up my sleeping pattern.  I go to bed so late, and wake up at like noon every day.  What the crap is with that my friend? I do not know.  Hmmm this is the last week before Tash and I go to volleyball camp, and although I am extremely out of shape, and haven't touched a volleyball outside of gym class since oh...November...I'm glad to be getting away, it will be nice.  The getting in shape thing worries me a little bit though, oh well.  Yeah, I'm really tired, and kind of babbling on, but I didn't want you to think I hate you my darling blog, because that is far from the truth.  I love you.  Now I think I'm going to go take a nap.    "Sometimes your words are thick as lead, you swing them strong upside my head. But what hasn't killed has made me strong.

      Today and tonight were mucho fun.  But tonight in particular.  Mike, Tyler, Artie, Taylor and myself went mini golfing, and then to Friendlys.  I was 17 over par at mini golf, and Mikes hole in one got spit back out at him.  Then at Friendlys Taylor slapped me in the face, she claims by accident, and everyone in the restaurant stares at her, and I get up in leave.  The rest of this story is second hand but apparently Taylor got up, while everyone was looking at her, and then tried to run after me, but gravity got the best of her and she fell hard on the ground, in front of everyone.  She proceeded to get off the ground and run after me, and by the time she got to my car she was laughing so hard she could barely breathe.    The other funny part of tonight was later on when Taylor, Artie and I decided to quickly stop by Booths to say hello.  While walking down the driveway Artie spots a tree branch that he decides to hang from.  The second Artie gets on the branch, which was not a very small branch, it comes crashing down,  with him and his legs wrapped around it.  Artie hits the ground, the huge branch lands on top of him.  Besides the fact that it hurt Artie a lot, it was probably one of the funniest things I've ever seen.   Crazy times my dear blog, crazy times.    " Can I sell this sunrise, in return for a sunset?

      Hello! Tash and I came home early, because it was much cheaper.  We depart again on Sunday.  I missed you blog blog.  Coming home early was quite funny because Tash and I showed up first at Arties house, who I was talking to on the phone at that time, telling him about the hotel in Virginia.  Bahaha, he was so confused.  Then we proceeded to Booths, and when he saw me he looked so scared and so confused.  It took both of them a little while to process what had happened.    Yesterday morning was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life.  I was   very very   tired from camp, and all I wanted to do was sleep.  But wait, at 10 freakin 30 in the morning my door opens, waking me from slumber, and Tash and Artie are standing in my room.  My response, "No, I hate you."  I think I said that a couple times.  They were so mean.  I was so angry.  Once they finally got me out of bed, and I showered, we went to Sharper Image and Brookstones in the mall and sat in comfy massage chairs.  That was nice.    Hmmm what to blog about now? This morning I made an egg white omelet.  It was nice.  I'm so stinkin excited for VWAP, it's going to be awesome.  Theres an ad on tv right now for this thing called the "Sonic clean between machine" and it's like electric floss for your teeth.  How interesting.  Right.  I think I'm done now.  I'm going to go take a shower and then hang out with Sir Tyler Bussey, but I think he's asleep.  So I'll wait til he wakes up.    "mmmm you smell like my mom" - tash bahahaha

      VWAP was really really good.  That trip is probably one of the most humbling experiences.  On the last night Taylor Tash and I were talking, and we were just talking about the kids there and their lives, and the things that they'd told us, and it's crazy.  It's like a whole nother world.  So needless to say, it was a very good trip.    It's August.  I don't know how I feel about this summer...I wasn't that excited about it to start, and now it's almost over.  It doesn't even feel like anything summerish happened.  Maybe this last month will bring some good summer excitment, but my hopes are not too high.     Right, I think I'm going to go eat some breakfast and scratch my bug bites, because I have 18 million.  Seriously.   "Jesus Christ, light up the world burning bright within our hearts forever.

      Last night was really fun.  It started out just me and Boofums hangin out, then Taylor telephonoed and invited us to mini golf with her, Tyler, and Mike.  Before we met up with them Boof and I went to Subway, where after ordering his sandwhich he realized he didnt' have any money, so he leaves me there with the subway guy and his sandwhich, while he runs to find an atm.  Good times.  On to mini golfing...much fun,  I am a spectacular mini golfer if any of you were wondering.  Par was 44, I got 68.  Taylor got 4 holes in one....who the crap does that? Tyler threw my golf ball across the road and I had to go get it, butt head...so what if I threw his first.    Tomorrow Boofus and I are going to Block Island to visit Artie, I'm excited...I just hope I don't get lost driving to Point Judith.  That would stinkaroo.  Well I'm going to go do some summer reading....how exciting....  "And in my darkest hour the brightest light draws near to me.  A torch to end all torches,  this is the light that sets me free .

      Today, I saw a real live drag queen.  I was in the city and in Grand Central, and I was coming out of the bathroom and there was this really tall girl in front of me and I remember looking at her from behind and being like "That girl is huge" then to my suprise, this "girl" turns around, and let me tell you, she is no girl at all.  I tried really hard not to stare but it was really hard.  Everyone else was staring too...I was just following the croud.    Tonight I hung out with Katie Bennett and Christine Tormey.  It was like way back in the day.  I realized tonight that they're 2 girls that I can go for so long not talking to but then the second I talk to them or get together with them it's like nothing ever changed - but in reality so much has changed.  It's just weird I guess.  I miss Katie a lot, she and I used to be best friends, and I know we'll always be there for eachother or whatever, and we always know whats going on in the other ones life, but it is different now, and we both went in such different ways in high school it just stinks that things changed.  That was a really big run on sentence.  With Christine it's just crazy...I've known that girl for so long, and I don't even know how our friendship works.  But I'm glad it does.  We were talking about how it's our senior year, and it hasn't really processed with me.  This is the last year to be with my friends, and I feel like I'm just starting to figure out who my real friends are, and now I don't even have a lot of time to spend with them.  I don't know, I'm getting all sentimental and attached.  I'll stop now.  Night night blog blog.   oh and one more thing...all of you out there that neglect your blogs (tyler, hathaway, bren...you know who you are) you make me ashamed.  love your darn blog.

      So it's 10:30 in the morning and I've been up since 8:30 and I've been quite bored.  Blogging is kind of a last resort.  Sorry blog blog, I'm using you.  But just because I'm using you doesn't mean I don't love you.  I think I'm going to try to go back to bed.

      Making fun in the dark...  So as most of you know the power went out yesterday.  It all started when George, Tash, Artie and I were at Dunkin Donuts.  It got quite hot quite fast so we decided to go to my house, thinking there would be power there.  We were wrong.  But nonetheless we sat around and did nothing, then decided to go and see if Wal Mart was open.  Weren't we suprised when we found that the power was out everywhere.  Thats when we turned on the radio, and I called my mommy, and we found out the power was out from Ottowa to Michigan.  Needless to say, no Wal Mart.  We returned home and George and Artie went out to get some exciting power out fun.  They returned with Booth, a radio, candy, and a board game.  Then Tash went to her house to get her laptop which has a DVD player on it.  When she returned she, Booth, and George went on a food search and suprisingly enough found food at Stop and Shop.  Then we made Annies and Tequitos on the stove in the dark.  Did you see the sky last night? Cause it was stinkin awesome.  Theres a lot of stars when the city isn't blocking them all out.  So we all took a trip to my roof and observed.  It was awesome.  After watching a little bit of Oceans 11 the boys decided to have a sleepover at Wes' in a tent, and Tash and I had a sleepover.  Not soon after the boys left, the power returned.  And so ends the blackout story.  But, it was good times.

      Last night I hung out with Amanda, Kyle, Goat, Bruno, Matt, Chino, Jill, Booth, my sister and Alex and we went exploring in Chinos old house.  It was so crazy.  I haven't been to that house in like 2 years, and it is so stinkin big.  Theres all these secret passage ways and the basement has like 10 million rooms.  It was intense.    Today the woman I babysat for decided that I was such a good babysitter that she was going to pay me $15 an hour.  I'm ok with that.  And thats all the excitment in my life right now.

      I'm home...Block Island was mucho fun.  I got a really bad sunburn on my back though.  No worries.  Also we went bridge jumping and when I got out of the water my foot was bleeding.  Don't really know how that happened, but it's ok.  The island was really pretty and I liked it a lot.  And of course time with Booth and Artie time was bueno.    So, Bren just came by to say goodbye because she left for college.  Did you catch that? Bren just left for college.  Thats sad.  She's one of the like 3 girls I am really close with.  But I know she's going to have an amazing time so I'm really happy for her.  The whole college thing freaks me out.  I don't like to think about the fact that a year from now it's me leaving.  I don't even know where I'm going to apply.  Aaaaaahhhhhhhh.  This is me about to start freaking out.  So I should stop.  And go watch tv, and not think about any of this.  Sounds good.

      Right, so I realized after posting my last post that I was doing exactly what I said not to do.  Just thought I'd point out the fact that I was being a huge hypocrite.  Anyways, I have a headache.  My sister left for college really early this morning and she was sad, so it made me sad.  Everyones all going to college...whats the deal with that?   This morning I was sitting on my couch, and I hear a thud at the french door, so I look thinking theres going to be someone there.  To my suprise I see a bird fall down and hit the ground.  Thats the second bird I've seen fly into my house and die.  I'm starting to think that maybe I should put up a sign or something to try and help these birds out.  It's really quite sad.

      I've played a lot of volleyball recently.  I'm sore.    If you have something you want to say to me get some guts and say it to my face.  If it's that important then theres no need to be stupid and childish and say it behind my back or in other dumb ways.  Say it to my face.  It's much easier that way.

      Yesterday was a good day.  Artie and I went out on his boat and first went to Rowayton for food then over to Fish Island to swim.  When we were at Fish we looked behind us to the shore and noticed a very ominous very black very quick moving cloud...so we decided it would probably be a good idea to head in.  By the time we were on the other side of the island the black cloud had taken over the island.  But it was cool because half the sky was black, and the other half was sunny.  By the time we got to the harbor area the sky was so dark, and we were going straight towards it...then it started lightning.  Right when we docked there was the loudest thunder ever.  It was all very exciting.  Luckily, we didn't die.  After that we picked up Jess and Caroline and headed to Stanwich.  Good times.  The BBQ was fun and then along with Taylor and Mike Shannon we went to Tylers, where I read about the Mole People, crazy business.  So like I said, yesterday was a good day.   Volleyball starts today.  And I'll be honest, I was not so excited.  But today I started thinking about it and I got really excited because I realized that it's a chance for me to play for God and use a gift he gave me to glorify him.  Yes, these next few weeks will be extremely difficult, and I might want to die, but I'm still excited to play for God.  So I thought I'd share that.  Now I'm going to go and enjoy my last 3 hours of freedom.  - peace.   "and maybe you're the dream I'm waking from..." - cademons call

      GIGA sleepover last night.  Mucho fun.  Thats probably the only group of girls I like.  We ate so much, it was awesome.  But I feel a little gross right now.  We watched How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and it was so funny, but defiently a chick flick with a sappy stupid ending.  We also watched The Princess Diaries but I fell asleep.   The one bad part of the evening was when Taylo and I were fighting, and I punched her in the shin and I hurt my hand so badly somehow, it still hurts now.  Stupid hand.    So...tomorrow...volleyball starts.  Do you want to know how not ok with that I am? Very not ok.  I'm so out of shape.  Oh man, it's going to suck.  I"m going to die.  Coach is going to kill me.  At the begining of the summer I had this great plan to get in shape, and be all ready for the season.  What the butt happened? I think this is the most out of shape I've been in so long.  Oh crap.  I'm going to cry.  Lets not think about it.  So today is my last day of freedom until September 20th.  Thats our first day off.  Thats more than a month away.  waaah waaah waaaah.  Ahhhhhhhhhh.  I can't think about this.  I have to go enjoy this last day.  Goodbye my dear blog blog.   "The summer days are gone too soon, shoot the moon, and miss completely..." - norah jones

      So one pulled groin and cartiladgless knee cap later, all in the same leg....I'm in a lot of pain.  And not to mention, school started today.  I thought senior year was supposed to be easy? I don't call a test on Friday and a 66 page packet about the "state of consciousness" easy.  Bah humbug.  Oh well, at least only 179 days left...  Just to review, I can't move my right leg, I have to go study for a test, and it's only been 1 day.  Ok.  Good.  Right.    "hold on to the light that guides you" - starting line

      School starts tomorrow.  I'll use this post to reminisce on summer....  The day school got out Booty and I had a little eating celebration.  We ate so much, and then picked up Taylor, and we all took naps.  Soon after...graduation.  Taylor was a little sad at graduation but we moved on.  The night ended with s'mores at Tyler Busseys house.  Good times.    Creation was incredible.  Oh wow...seems like so long ago.  Don't even know what to say except it was so awesome.  God is always awesome though so theres no suprise there.    The beginning of July was interesting, needless to say there was more unexpected drama then I ever though possible this summer.  Good times were had though.  The fireworks for the 4th of July on the Van Scivers boat that we never saw because of the big cloud were fun.  And of course there was the Fireside Restaurant incident.    On to volleyball camp.  All I have to say is a wholllle lot of Tash.  She'll appreciate the following momentos... - Cinnamon Poptarts - " I feel you breathing on my shoulder..."  - My highway... - The big poop!!!  - Speed limit in West Virginia - 6 in 2  - 5 am...  - Making friends with the truckers ooooh good times.     The end of July brought VWAP, so much fun.  The kids in Dunlow are amazing, needless to say....and it was my first encounter with roofball, again needless to say, I'm so bad at roofball.  But again, awesome trip and awesome memories.    August...not much happened, but it went by so fast.  Let's see what I can remember.  Going with Booth to Block Island to visit Artie was fun, even though Booth is very grumpy if you wake him up early in the morning or keep him up late at night.  Oh I love Booth.  What else.  Yeah I don't really know...I'm running out of summer fun here.  Then volleyball started, and that brings us to the present.  School tomorrow.  And so begins the supposedly fabulous senior year.  Who knows what'll happen.  All I know is tomorrow is my last first day back at DHS.  It's all about to go down...  "Through my window sun begins to shine.  Welcome to a summer's fun, endless mornings full of the brightest light. And I could keep this moment close enough to never let it go" -fairweather

      So last night, I arrive home and see that the lights in my room are on and theres someone in it....wondering what the butt is going on I venture up the stairs only to catch Goat and Tyler walking down the stairs with my brother following them.  We talk, and it turns out they'd just been hanging out at my house for an hour.  I wasn't home.  Very interesting...  More volleyball today, and then some more tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that.....right.  It just keeps going.  Tash and I are having a movie and ice night tonight.  Very very exciting.  I can't believe school starts the day after tomorrow.  What happened to this summer? Hmm I'll reminisce later...Tash is here now.  bye bye!

      One good thing about volleyball...  You can eat so much food.  Last night after practice I ate an entire box of Annies, and 4 cookies.  And right now I'm eating an Italian Combo, and I had some lasagna before that.  So good.  But...I finished eating now, and I smell, and need a shower....so I'm going to go do that.    Do you realize school starts in 3 days?

      Saturday was good times... Practice was only 2 hours long, and it was actually fun.  After that was some quality team bonding at Sarahs. Fun times. Then Saturday night after GIGA Taylor and I decided to go swimming at Tokeneke but much to our dismay when we arrived Bryan Stinchfield had just closed the pool because he quote, "heard thunder" Bah.  So we went to McDonalds and proceeded to be in terrible moods, but then Mike Shannon showed up and all was well.  We all went over to Arties where Tyler and Craig were hangin out and the Van Sciver parental units were celebrating their 17th anniversary.  Taylor decided that their pool would suffice for the lack of pool at Tokeneke so she dove in and Tyler soon followed.  After a while we headed again to McDonalds to meet Dave Landers...and this is where the night got funny.  Taylor and Artie got into a fight of some sort, and they ended up chasing eachother outside...Artie ran to come back inside and Taylor followed, but not realizing the door was a pull not a push...she ran head first into the door.  I don't remember the last time I've laughed so hard.  Anyways, after loitering at McDonalds for a long time we all headed home.    Yesterday I woke up at 11:15 and left for practice at 11:35 then returned home at 4:30.  It's cool to get out of practice a half hour late.  Then I went to Stanwich and trucked 5 kids there, I felt like a soccer mom.  But the service was really good.  Last night was an early night though cause I had vball at 8 this morning.  Which brings me to where I am now.  And now I have to go do work....but I haven't blogged for a long time and I didn't want to neglect you little blog blog.  I loooooooove you.

      This morning while getting ready for church I stepped on a dead bee and it stung me in the pinky toe of my right foot.  That was the first time I've ever been stung by a bee, and it hurt so much.  I was such a baby about it, I went into my moms room crying and woke her up.  I felt like such a girl...but then agian, I am one.

      Blog blog! Sorry I neglected you for so long..nothing personal, just volleyball.     I have a story to tell...  So Friday after the volleyball game the team decides that we're going to have team bonding, but I had already told Artie I would hang out with him.  So the whole ride home I get crap from the team, and they don't shut up...mind you we were coming all the way from Trumbull.  Anyways, later that night when I'm at Arties we're down in the basement watching tv, and I look over because I hear a noise, and there are 11 of the volleyball players just standing there.  Staring.  Sweet.  Apparently they thought it'd be really funny to show up, and considering the fact that Jess plays volleyball she thought she'd help them all by sneaking them into the basement.  Go volleyball.  So thats my story.    Besides that my life is pretty boring.  So I'm going to go now.  See you later alligator...  " Warm October nights you came and cuddled next to me baby yah yah.

      I've been sick...  So for the past week or two I've been feeling really crappy, but I've just ignored it.  On Wednsday though, my throat hurt so much that I could no longer ignore it and Ms. Prescott, the faithful school nurse sent me to the doctor.  Where I learn that I have an infected lymphnode in my throat.  This means, that my throat hurts like crazzzzzzzy.  I don't ever remember having such a bad sore throat.  I've also been getting random fevers, which is fun.     Yesterday and today I stayed home from school.  Quite a weird feeling going from being gone from about 7:15 every morning til 6:45 every night to being home allll day long with nothing to do.  Yesterday I found that my sister bought the entire first season of Dawsons Creek on DVD, and today, I completed the season.  Thats 13 hours of Dawsons Creek in case you were wondering.  Thats a whole lot of Dawsons Creek.  I need to get out of my house, but I don't think thats going to happen any time soon.  So for now it looks like my tv and my couch are my best friends.

      Here I am, eating some apple sauce.  And I thought it would be appropriate to blog.  Today I went on a field trip with my english class, we went to New Haven to see The Syringa Tree, it's this play.  One woman played 24 roles.  It was craziness, but pretty good.  Our bus driver was so annoying though, I think he liked his little intercom thing a little too much, he talked on it for sooooo stinkin long about absolutely nothing.  By the time we got home I had a really big headache, so I came home, laid down, and just woke up.  I guess thats what mono does to you.  Now I'm very sleepy, but I have to fight it and do some homework before I return to the best place in the world...my bed.  Besides that tomorrow is a Friday, and a three day weekend.

      It's official, I have mono.  Did you give it to me? I'll break your face if you did.  So you better hope you didn't.  Anyways, mono means no volleyball until October 19th.  I came home after school today, for the first time all year...and took...a nap.  Then I did homework.  And it's only 6:03 pm.  I should have a half hour of practice left.  Aaaaaaaaaah this is no fun.  I'm sorry, I'll stop complaining now.  Maybe I should go work on that college application stuff.  Hmm...

      So for the first time I'm experiencing what it means to be a senior slacker.  My college application is done...I have no homework....and nothing to do.  It's fabulous.  It feels like a Saturday afternoon, even though it's 7:26pm on a Wednsday.  Regardless, it's nice.  The mono is still here, saw stupid doctor yesterday, she said I have to wait the stupid 3 weeks to play volleyball. Stupid spleen and liver.  Stupid Stupid.  Stupid.  Anyways, I think I'm going to go enjoy the whole slacker deal....it's well deserved.

        cuddle and a kiss on the forehead - you like to be close to your special someone and feel warm, comfortable, and needed    urlLink   What Sign of Affection Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Homecoming has been fun so far, we had awesome outfits for volleyball, which got destroyed by the stupid administration.  So annoying, but whatever, it's over, no need to go getting all angry again.  I got the blood tests done yesterday to see if i'm mono free yet and able to play volleyball. i'll find out monday.  goood times.  the bonfire was good last night, nickie ward is such a crazy drummer, crazy.  it was a little bit cold and rainy though.  oh well.  afterward taylor artie and i hung out and she and i told artie that we feel bad that he has to hang out with us a lot and doesn't get to hang out with boys, and he said that it's ok, and that taylor makess up for any lack of testosterone.  well imagine that, taylor got "mad".  she jumped out of my car, which was still slowly moving.  She starts running down the post road and artie jumps out after her.  I went and parked in Arties driveway and walked out to the street where I see artie carrying taylor, while shoving her head through bushes at the same time...they end up in the backyard fighting, becaues taylor thinks shes going to get artie into the pool, which doesn't happen, actually the reverse happened, and taylor ended up in the non-heated pool in the rain.  it was all very entertaining.  that was probably the most excitment my night saw.    i miss someone....they were one of my best friends, and i don't think this person even cares we don't talk anymore.  it doesn't even seem to be something they've even thought about.  oh well, it just makes me sad because i still love this person a lot, and i feel like i'm not good enough to be his friend anymore.  oh well.    my sister comes home today.  i missed her, and i love her.  yay!    THE DOCTORS JUST CALLED!!! I'M MONO FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOHOOOOO!!!!!!!

      So maybe I'm not supposed to talk about this because I never have before, at least not in my blog...but I'm thinking about it, because I just read Kevins blog, and I guess I just want to get the record straight on my feelings and opinions about the subject.  I figure if everyone else in the world can have an opinion/take sides on the me and artie thing, I might as well get to share my feelings.  First, I never ever ever tried to break artie and alyssa up, and I never ever ever ever told him that I thought he shouldn't be with her, it wasn't my intent to steal him from her or anything like that.  I don't even know half of what was going on with them, I was just being arties friend, and yeah, I know that maybe I shouldn't have been such good friends with him because it made alyssa uncomfortable, but I tried to respect that and if anything tried to discourage my friendship with him or put distance between us.  I know she thinks that it was all my plan for them to break up, but honestly, i never saw it coming and when it did happen, there was   nothing   between me and artie.  nothing.  and i wouldn't have been his friend, and supported him unless I believed he broke up with her for reasons that didn't concern me at all, and that is what i still believe.  i don't think it had anything to do with me, and if it had, i would have gotten out of that situation as quickly as i could have.  I know that alyssa will never believe me, and i know she hates me and blames it all on me, shes defiently made that clear, but i honestly don't believe i had control over any of what happened.  it all just happened.  and i wish that she had never gotten hurt, and that everyone was still on good terms, and i wish there was some way i could make her understand...but i've kind of given up on that happening, because the one time i tried i failed miserably.  If anything I wish it all could have happened right, but because of how much prayer went into the whole situation I have to believe it happened not nescessarily how everyone wanted it to, but because God was/is working bigger things through it all.  I know people are going to have their opinions, some are honest enough to share them with me, while others just talk about it behind my back...I've really given up on caring, or trying to make people understand more of what really happened, because I know that in every situation people have opinions, and usually those opinions are biast and hard to change.  So I've accepted that, and moved on...I just wish everyone else would.    " Hate is excess baggage" -american history X

It was awesome.  So thats why I thought I'd share it with you.    Last night I got the Yellowcard cd (thank you tash) SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO stinkin good.  You should all go buy it right now.

      So it's a Friday night, I'm at home, let's reminicse...  Today was the last volleyball practice of my entire life.  It was so weird, I can still remember walking into the gym my first day freshman year, and the thought " it won't be that bad" went through my mind.  I've never been so wrong in my life.  That day I almost died.  It's just crazy to think about how much happened in those 4 years, and how fast they went by.    I was also just thinking about how different each of my high school years was.  Freshman year I hung out with so many kids that I don't even talk to anymore.  It's weird to think that my best friends when I was a freshman are kids that I don't even so much as say hi to in the halls, it just shows how much people change in high school.  Sophomore year was probably my best year, I looked up to those older kids so much, and just being around them helped me grow so much in my faith, and even if it sounds stupid they showed me what I wanted to be like when I was older.  So Junior year when they were gone it was so hard for me at first, I didn't even know what to do.  Junior year was probably my least favorite year, it brought with it a lot of crap, but I think it's also the year I grew the most.  It's when I grew to become the least dependent on other people and most dependent on God and myself.  I think everything I went through last year I learned from in some way or another so in the end I'm grateful for that.  This year has been pretty good so far, but  I think one of the things I've realized the most about myself is that I'm not the type of person who needs a lot of friends, or needs to be surrounded by people.  Kinda the opposite, I like to be alone a lot, and would rather have like 3 or 4 good friends that I know I can trust and that I know are true friends than have a million people that I say are my friends but aren't really.  I don't know...this is just me blabbing on and on.  Anyways, tonight I was talking to my sister on the phone as I got to the football game and she heard me talking to people and what not and she told me I was making her miss Darien and then she said, "Meg, enjoy Darien as long as you're there" and it made me think about how even though I'm excited for college, this is my last year here and I don't think home will be the same once I leave here, so maybe I shouldn't be in such a rush to.  So I think thats what I'm going to do....

      This weekend has been fun, but it's always too short... Friday we had a game for vball, and now we're in quarter-finals for states.  Saturday I went to the football game with Boof and Taylor, but it was freezing so we didn't stay for that long, then I went to GIGA, some of the conformation dinner which was cool, and then hung out with artie boof and hathaway for a little bit.    I hate my neighbor.  Every stinkin weekend he's out there doing sometihng to his lawn at like 7 in the morning.  This morning he had a leaf blower going from 8:15 til 9.  I had pillows over my head, I opened my shades and glared at him, I opened the front door and yelled for him to stop...but none of it worked.  So now I'm sitting here, sleep deprived and cranky cause of the stupid guy.  grrrrr   " i let go, theres just no one that gets me like you do, you are my only, my only one" - yellowcard

      Hello! I hope everyone out there had a Happy Thanksgiving.  I had some quality family fun as always.  Yesterday was fun, Artie and I went into the city to hang out with my sister and Alex.  We saw Alex's house....insane people, it was crazy.  Hugeness richness to the max.  Then we got some good pizza, walked through Central Park, headed to FAO Schwartz, where there was a line around the block to get in the front enterance...little do people know though that if you walk around to Madison Ave. you can get in the back enterance with no line.  Some people just don't think.  So we had some good times at FAO Schwartz.  Then we went to Rockofeller or however you spell it center and saw the tree.  And that was the end of our adventure in New York.  Last night Booth, Taylor, Artie, Bren and I watched the movie They, it's so bad.  Don't ever see it.  Oh man, so bad.     Now, I've been sitting in my pajamas for 2 hours, so maybe I'll go shower and be productive with my life.  Sounds exciting...

Friday night I saw Cat in The Hat,  SOOOOO bad.  So bad.  So bad.  Don't see it.  Such a disappintment.  Anyways, I'm gong to go enjoy this beautuis Sunday and yeah...ok.  Peace out.

      Tonight was the vball banquet, it's all over, forever.  Thats so crazy.  The past 4 years went by so quickly.  Wooooah.  It's just weird to think that I am forever done with volleyball at Darien.  Everyone was all emotional and crying, and I didn't think I'd get caught in it...but I defiently did, not going to deny it.  Even though my feelings towards it all were mixed this year, with getting sick and whatnot, it really was one of the most amazing experiences of my life to be part of that team, and coach is really an incredible person who taught me so much.  Wow...I guess all I can say is that I'm so grateful to have had that experience.    Tell everybody I'm on my way and I'm loving every step I take.  With the sun beating down yes, I'm on my way and I can't keep this smile off my face -phil collins

      So, I think it's safe to say that my biggest flaw is my impatience.  Whenever I want something I want it right then, I hate waiting more than anything else in the world.  Naturally, God knows this, and I'm beginning to become quite convinced that he does not like this one bit.  You're wondering why I think this?  Well because He has been teaching me patience in the most amazing ways, his latest act and reminder of whos in control and whos timing everything happens in, was my nice deferral from Furman.  Haha, it's funny really, because I was so determined to know where I was going to college as soon as possible (thats the whole hating to wait thing) but God just wasn't about that, and it was His plan to make me wait, and trust Him.  So, here we go....

      Woohooo vacation is tomorrow.  So pffsyched, and I've actually gotten excited for my trip to Cancun.  It'll be good family bonding.  I think Taylors dead, last I talked to her she had a 103 fever and every time I've tried to call the line's been busy, probably because they're making funeral arrangments and calling distant relatives in Bora Bora to let them know.  I'll miss her.    Frank got married yesterday, which means he's on his honey moon, and I think we   all   know what that means.  Yeah.  Go Frank.  What else is going on in life? My subsitute teacher in english hit on me today and then he goes, "Don't be offended I'm old enough to be your grandfather."  Weird...   Funny story...I lost alllll of my cd's.  Or rather, my sister lost all my cd's.  I miss them dearly.  If any of you out there who read this, not that I can think of anyone who does anymore, takes any pity on my loss of 40 something cd's and wants to burn me some, I would not mind at all.  In fact I would be so happy, it would make this grieving process a little easier.     Well thats all for now.  I hope all of you out there in blogger land have a stupendous Christmas, and remember what it's all about.  Peace.    "Congratulations, it's a God!" - Dr. Ray haha I love that man

      Reasons why for the past 3 days I have felt like a mother... 1.  Took my brother to the doctor when he was sick, I drove the Suburbain.  2.  Picked up brothers percsricption, again drove Suburbain.  3.  Made Shepards pie last night and had small dinner party with Taylor, Arite, and Kevin.  4.  Ran errands today ie. returned clothes, went to the sports shop, picked up my moms shoes from the shoe repair store.    Weird.   Top 3 trends I hate the most this season... 1.  UGGS. They are gross. Especially when people tuck their jeans into them.  What is that?  2.  Von Dutch hats....$80 for a trucker hat? Thats crap.   3.  Leggings under skirts.  It's not the 80's anymore.    It is so cold out.  So cold.  I feel like I'll turn into a popsicle if I'm outside for too long.

      So Cancun was awesome, I got to spend so much time with God and even had some enjoyable family time.  It's just impossible to be in a place that beautiful and not see God everywhere.  It was very nice.  I've applied to 4 more schools since the big fat defferal, Santa Clara, Loyola, University of Richmond, and College of Charleston.  We'll see what goes down.    I was reading blogs today, and came across Taylors, and she had lyrics from a mae song, a band I've never heard of, so I decided to check them out, and I found this song and the lyrics are so amazing because they relate directly to a situation that kind of re-surfaced today, and that I was talking with Taylor about, so they get the honor of going in my blog.  Enjoy!   We write to apologize. We ask to look past life as it goes by. I know you have sacrificed time, life, love, time to fly. Please consider all things trite, forgiveness will be the thing that gets us by. I know to have something like this broken is hard to fix.  Embers, we're burning bridges down. Envelopes stuffed with feelings found. To write this down as means to reconcile.  We write to patch things up, maybe not to agree but to proclaim love. Let's look ahead and then we'll see the one whose glory never ends. And based on that we'll see, there'll be room for change, but gradually. I know to have something like this broken is hard to fix.  If all is said and done and over, if we don't have to, we're not going to. Make the change, it's worth the try. What's broken can be fixed tonight. - mae

      Snow day was a gift from God....thank Yooooou.   I just read Hathaways blog, and I think he is very right.  It's been on my heart a lot recently to be more conscious of the things I surround myself with.  Like what I watch on tv, and especially since I started reading Every Womans Battle, what I listen to.  I've been trying really hard recently, not always doing the best, but trying, to always keep God in mind, and to not let my thoughts stray from him, or anything that is pleasing to him.  It's defiently hard, but it's what He calls us to do.    So just to reiterate....I think you're dead on Hathaway.

      I am officially a second semester senior....  wow.  I have precisely 90 days of high school left.  That is insane my friends, hopefully within those 90 days I will find out where I am going to college.  Just a little detail.   So this weekend I went snowboarding in Connecticut..I know, I didn't know Connecticut had mountains either.  But in all fairness I don't think it really counted as a mountain, more an oversized hill.  But it was fun.  And this weekend is Okemo, WOOHOO!!! So excited.  Oh it will be awesome.  I hope no one gets hurt this year, that would be stupendous.    I have to do so much law and gov stuff tomorrow.  aaaahhhhhhh.  oh well, it's my fault, I left it all to the last minute.    Mr. Hardinge died Saturday night.  I guess it was one of those things I knew would happen eventually, but I didn't think it would happen so soon.  I know in a lot of ways it's a huge blessing because he was suffering so much, but it still makes me sad.  Em is amazing though, she's so strong.  The service is next Tuesday...it's going to be sad but I think the whole volleyball team owes it to the Hardinge family to go.  So for those of you who read this, please keep them in your prayers.     "He will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The former things have passed away."  -revelations 21:4

      So last night or shall I say early this morning? My mom wakes me up and tells me to go let the dog out because she's downstairs freaking out.  I go downstairs and Stacey is running around like a crazy dog so I open the door and let her out.  While I'm waiting for her I go to the bathroom and pass by the room that I'm always scared of when it's dark out...it's been this way since the first day I moved into my house.  For those of you who know my house it's the small piano room next to the living room with all the windows in it.  Seeing this room that always scares me and the fact that it's 3 in the morning somehow triggers the thought of the movie Signs, and the aliens in it.  Although I will agree with anyone that the movie is extremely stupid, I have a fear of aliens, and those aliens in that movie are freaky.  Aliens and the easter bunny, the two things I'm scared of most...and they don't even exist.  I'm so weird.   Anyways, so now I'm all freaked out thinking that there are aliens in the room and I hurry and get Stacey inside and bring her up to my room where I proceed to lock the door and make Stacey sleep on my bed.  Then, precisely three hours later at 6 o'clock, Stacey wakes me up because she farts really loudly..then insists on going outside yet again.  ( She ate an entire box of cookies 2 days ago, so I think she was feeling the reprecussions).  So again I go downstairs and let my dog out, and start thinking about aliens.  Somehow the sixth sense gets into my head too and I start thinking about the kid who got shot in the head in the movie.  These were very scary thoughts.  I let Stacey in, gave her fresh water, and quickly returned to my room where I firmly shut the door and pulled the blankets up high.  I'm such a baby.     What else can I blog about....Okemo was mucho mucho fun, even though it was freezing.  Very good times.  I feel kinda bad because I got really crabby last night and turned into a jerk towards Taylor and Artie, sorry guys.  I was being stupid.  Break is in 2 weeks...thats exciting but at the same time I don't feel like I've been in school for like a month because of exams and snow days and what not.    Yellowcard is next Friday...woohooo!!!!!!   I read this in Stellas blog, which I don't read that often but stumbled upon today, and I liked it very much...so I'm quoting it here.  This might weird him out, but I don't think he reads my blog anyways.  Later gator.     "when i grow up and have a wife, i want to have one coat, so i can by like "hey hun, where's my coat?" and she'll tell me that its in the washing machine. then ill tell her that i love her and she will say it back, because she always says it back."   -stella

      I just got off the couch downstairs where I spent precisely the last two and a half hours, as I get up I hand the clicker to my mom who changes the channel to CNN and says, "Larry!" as in her dear friend Larry Cudlow who hosts the show Crossfire, which happened to be on.  I proceed to look at my mom who has failed to change out of her pajamas today and has a nice case of bed hair, and I wonder...who is this woman?

      The sunny weather is making me happy.   Today I fell asleep in school for the first time ever.  It was interesting.  Then during 6th period Melida and I wreaked havoc in the library.  It was fun.  This afternoon I went to Pegasus for the first time, which for those of you who don't know is a theraputic horseback riding center for kids with mental disabilities or retardations.  It was really awesome, but at the same time sad.  I just kept looking at the moms that were watching from the side and thinking about how hard it must be for them.  Like the girl I worked with in the second lesson, I don't know exactly what she had but she couldn't speak except making long noises that sounded somewhat like words if she repeated them enough.  Her facial features were also really distorted.  But I was just watching her mom from the side, and the girl knew some sign language, and could understand what you were saying to her, but she was unable to respond.  It just must be so hard for parents to deal with all the time, and so heartbreaking to know that your kid will never have all the opportunities that they might have had if things were different.  At the same time though there is such an amazing innocence about kids like that, and I sometimes feel like I can see God through them more than other kids their ages, or just people in general.  Anyways thats my Pegasus experience, if anyone reads this and wants to volunteer they need help desperately, it's like once a week for 2 hours, and you don't need any horse experience.  Let me know if you want to help.    Being around horses also made me really miss riding.  This is becoming a long blog.  Today I saw a kid wearing a sweatshirt for a band called The Used, and it reminded me that last year I listened to them a lot, and then just forgot about them.  So I'll quote them in my darling blog, because they were good.   "well your never gonna find it if you're looking for it  won't come your way well you'll never find it if you're looking for it   should've done something but I've done it enough by the way your hands were shaking rather waste some time with you   and you never would have thought in the end how amazing it feels just to live again it's a feeling that you cannot miss it burns a hole through everyone that feels it " - the used

      What a nice day!!!! Yay for warmth.  SO, I got into another college...Washington College, it's dead last on my list...but they offered me a scholarship.  Craziness! Why don't any of my top choices offer me scholarships? Or even admission? Well, I could go to Washington and play volleyball and have a scholarship...thats nice to know at least.    The Passion was really good, I didn't think the violence was as bad as everyone said, and afterwards Artie and I went through all the gospels to find where the stuff in the movie matched up with scripture, and it was all in accordance which was awesome.  The character of Satan in the movie really scared me though...I slept in my mommys room cause I was so scared.  But it's all good now.   I have been a babysitting  machine   this weekend.  I babysat last night, and now I have to go babysit again, but this time it's for my favorite Wil Sorenson, so I'm excited.  Man, with all this money I'm making I'm gonna be rollin in the dough...watch out.    PS- Everyone should listen to Stevie Wonders, "Isn't she lovely" it's the best song EVER.  Go listen to it. Now.

      An ode to my friend Taylor...  Today you were sick  I hope the doctor didn't give you a finger prick When you're not at school, time seems to tick.    Why do you have to be sick? You are the girl that I most certainly miss.  Go to bed, rest your head. And take some meds.  If you were to die that would be a dread. But you are strong and will survive.     I love you Taylor Evelyn.

      Woooooo, it's been a good weekend.  Today is absolutely beautius.  I've been hearing it's supposed to snow tonight, but I'm not going to believe that.    The famine was awesome, so much money was raised....like $8,000 or something.  Crazy business.  I just went grocery shopping and I think I had a little too much fun, I got really excited about going.  I'm on a health food craze, and I hope it lasts.  I just bought like a million fruits and good stuff.  Let's see how long I last.    Natalie and I did a kickboxing class at the Y, and it was so fun, and you're jealous.  You wish you could kickbox.  ha.  I'm just blabbing about absolutely nothing.  blab blab blab.  Ok, I"m done.

      Rocking the wait list.... Oh well.  I guess it's better than rejection.  I got into Goucher though.  So now I've been accepted to my bottom 3 schools, and wait listed at my top choice.   Last night my sister went with her boyfriend to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony because his dad was being inducted.  Lets compare my night to that of my sisters....  She walked the red carpet....I walked the aisles of Trader Joes.   She got yelled at by Jamie Prestley for bumping her friend....I got yelled at for not folding laundry by my mom.    She ate a gourment meal....I didn't have enough powdered sugar for the cake I tried to make.   She bought a new dress and new shoes....I wore the jeans I've worn for the past two days and stole Arties sweatshirt.   She sat back to back with Puff Daddy and Outkast while listening to the likes of Mick Jagger, Prince, Alicia Keys, and Bruce Springsteen....I sat on the couch with Artie and listened to my mom ramble on.    I'd say all in all, I defiently had the better night.   I must say, it's all a little weird for me.

      If I didn't have God I would be so lost.  He is incredible.   I'm kind of going through a phase where I can't wait to go to college.  Sometimes it just feels like there are too many things here holding me down and distracting me from what God really wants me to do. But I know once I leave here I'll miss it.  I just have to find the happy medium.    I hear from Furman tomorrow....

      Don't  Stray, don't ever go away I should be much too smart for this You know it gets the better of me  sometimes, when you and I collide I fall into an ocean of you pull me out in time Don't let me drown, let me down I say it's all because of you And here I go, losing my control I'm practicing your name so I can say it to your face It doesn't seem right, to look you in the eye Let all the things you mean to me Come tumbling out my mouth Indeed it's time tell you why I say it's infinitely true And there's no cure, and only to be sure Why everything's turned inside out And still in so much doubt It makes me so tired - I feel so uninspired My head is battling with my heart My logic has been torn apart       -Sway

      I love my daddy...  Today I was outside reading for school and the warm weather reminded me of when I was little and my daddy used to take us outside to play and he'd spray us with the hose.  (Our version of a swimming pool).  Even though my daddys old and people think he's crabby I think he's the best daddy in the world.  When we would go to Cape Cod he would take us to the penny candy store, and I would get so excited to have a dollar to spend on candy.  And then he'd take us to Four Seas Ice Cream, which has the best ice cream ever, and I would be so happy.  Also on Cape Cod my sister and I became the "Flying Bolognia Sisters" and we would do simultaneous cart wheels and thought we were so cool.  And my daddy would watch us and be proud of us.  In Delaware he would take us to the drug store down the street called Happy Harrys and get us milky ways and peppermint patties (that went in the freezer).  He loved giving us special treats like Klondike bars, or cheese balls, and when he made us chocolate milk he would put extra chocolate on the spoon for us to lick.  And when I went to camp in the summer he would write me silly letters telling me he'd met Madonna or something crazy like that, then at the end he'd draw stick figures of my whole family and lable them.  When I was really little I didn't like sleeping alone, and it took me a really long time to fall asleep.  So my daddy would lie on my floor waiting for me to fall asleep, and sometimes he would try to sneak out but I would always catch him.  I was also really scared of going upstairs alone in my old house, and so my daddy would always go with my and hold my hand and tell me there was nothing to be afraid of.  For years he would tell my brother and me stories before we fell asleep, and they always started off with, "A long time ago a little girl and her brother..."  They were the best stories ever.  My daddy also sings random lines from old songs to me, and they've become engraned in my memory.  The two that I remember the most are, "You're 16 you're beautiful and you're mine"  and " I love you a bushel and a peck, bet your pretty neck I do." And before we go to bed at night my daddy always says, "Goodnight have happy dreams, dream about bunnies"  I don't think I've ever once dreamt about bunnies, but thats ok.  I love my daddy.    "It is then that I can trust.  In celebration of the air we breathe, we place all regrets aside.  To capture this moment is to let go of the last.  Love takes hold.  How beautiful heaven must be..." -sleeping at last

      GEORGIA WAS AMAZING.  And that is all I have to say about that.  Hands down the best way I ever could have spent my spring break.  So much fun, and got to know a lot of people I didn't know very well before and meet the coolest 82 year olds ever.    Today was a cruel snapback into reality though.  I took out my assignmnet pad and looked at next week....here's my schedule.  Starting Sunday, 1 1/2 hour review session for AP Euro.  Monday Euro final.  Tuesday Euro final.  Wednsday AP Law and Gov final, Wednsday night AP Euro review session.  Thursday AP Euro exam. Friday AP English exam.  So if anyone is in the business of killing and wants to take me out sometime next Sunday morning I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.    "Descend into a room down the hall.  My hands are shaking, I must reason with the angels.  They will understand, they will see the tears.  Tell everyone I can make them better and ride away, a new hours entering a place of uncertainty and mistakes.." - the working title

      It seems like every time I read a live journal or blog now adays it's just people ranting about how much their lives suck and blah blah blah.  I'm not saying I've never done it, but I guess just when you go through like five live journals and all people do is complain and are all woe is me it just seems stupid and so self absorbed.  Life doesn't suck just cause you're sad for a few minutes, God gave us all the ability to have amazing lives, and honestly, life isn't about us anyways.  It's about Him.  I don't know, I guess I'm just frustrated because reading all these journals makes me feel like people don't see it because they can't see past themselves.  It's stupid, we all need to learn to get over ourselves and live this life for what it's really meant for.

      It's raining...  But thats ok.  This weekend was fun.  Friday night I was on Safe rides, which was really dead b/c of sats and the freshman sophomore dance.  So we got to leave at 12:45 instead of 1:30 which was nice.  Saturday I was going to study for Euro, but that didn't happen and I ended up farting around until GIGA which was good as always, and then the Nubian Gents, were AWESOME. I got to hang out with Artie too, which was nice because I see the kid next to never. Especially with APs these next two weeks, I probably won't see him til prom.  Today was our nine month anniversary.  Crazy business.  It doesn't seem like that long in comparison to other relationships I know about and it doesn't feel like that long but who knows.  All I know is I love him a lot a lot.  This is kinda weird, I've never blogged about him before.  So I'm going to stop now.  So to wrap it up, Sunday I studied allll day.  Today I took the first part of my euro final, and then when I tried to study when I came home I fell asleep.  Whooooops.  I should go do that now though.  Later...

      haha I got into loyola today.  I almost hesitated for a second in calling and turning them down, but then I came to my senses and made the call.  It's weird because today I was talking to Minnie about how she's going there and she thought I was too, ope.  A lot of kids from our school go there though.  I know Henry Holmes does, Jess Koontz, and Ali Watts, and Minnie are going there this year, and I think Mark Gleason is too.  I'm excited that no one is going to Furman.    Oh yeah, and it's 12:52, and I've been out of school for an hour already.  Ooooh life is nice.    OH MY GOSH!!!! THERES A PERVIEW ON TV FOR THE NEW HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I COULD NOT BE ANY MORE EXCITED!!!!!!   oooh wow, now that its been established that I'm such a huge loser I'm going to go sit on the couch.  bahaha

      I GOT INTO FURMAN!!!! WOOOOHOOOO!!!!!!!  God is so incredible...let me explain...  So I felt really strongly that God was telling me I'd get into Furman and that that was where he was calling me. But I wasn't really trusting him and was hesitant to step out in faith and say that I felt God was calling me to something.  So I didn't.  And then I got deferred after applying early decision.  Then I got wait listed.  And it wasn't until the night before I got wait listed that I really gave it up to God and trusted that he wanted me to go to Furman, and I didn't hesitate in telling people that either.  And then when I found out I was on the wait list the letter said that around 400 kids stay active on the wait list, and the most they take is 5.  But I still trusted God, sent my deposit to my safety school that I hadn't even visited, and waited.  Today, I got a call from the head of admissions telling me that I got in...and check this out.   714  kids stayed on the wait list, they offered spots to  3 , and I was the  FIRST ONE  to be offered admissions.  Those are not what you call "good odds" but God is amazing, and hooked me up so much.  I am so excited and so in awe.    " Trust in the Lord with all you heart and lean not on your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight" - proverbs 3:5-6

      Friday night Taylor and I dragged Booth and Artie to see 13 Going on 30.  It was amazing, unfortuately, the boys did not agree. Oh well.  Last night I went to Blockbuster and rented Uptown Girls.  Another great film.  Today I picked up my dear dear friend Kyle Loughran (watch out kids her dads a cop) from the airport and we hung out for a good while.  Then Bren and I went to Stanwich.  Yaay for college kids being home!   This seems like I neglected my mother on mothers day, but just so you know, she was in Seattle visiting my sister.  And I called her and told her I loved her.    Now that APs are over I'm finally learning what it means to be a second semester senior...and let me just say...it's fabulous.

      Happy Birthday Sister!!!!!!!! Wow, Em turns 20 today.  That is so old.  Her teenage years are officially over.  I love my sister, this morning she came into my room when she woke up and we had a good long talk.  It's cool to see how God is working in her life in a similar way that he's working in mine.  She's the bestest sister in the world, and I couldn't have asked for a better one.  I know we fight sometimes and don't always agree but I think it makes our relationship stronger and better.  She is someone I know I'll always have and that will always understand me, and that it why I love her.  For being only 20 she's got so much wisdom and understanding and I realized when I was talking to her this morning that when you get down to it we are so similar and have so many of the same views and feelings about things.  So, yay for sisters.

      Yooooooo.  What a nice day.  I'm really begining to understand this whole second semester senior thing.  Again today I left school at 12:10, because classes were done, not that I'd really had any before that, and then came home and bummed around til the tennis match.  Where Taylor laid down the SHAWBOOM! and won.  I'm so proud of her.  After that I hung out with Artie which is always nice.  But he jumped on my brothers bed and broke it.  Shh it's a secret though cause he fixed it.  But it took him a really long time and involved a hammer and some other sorts of hardware appliances.  Good times.   Oh yeah, prom was fun too.  Post prom was lame, and none of my pictures came out, but it was good overall.  Saturday Taylor, Artie, Kev and I went to see Julie and Chip because they are PARENTS now, which is just sooo crazy.  Noah is adorable.    Ok, my brother is playing saxaphone really loud right next to me, so I'm going to call it quits.  Peace.   "And if they try to tell you love fades with time.

      Pardon me while I reminisce...  So I just signed on my screen name that I never go on to check my mail...and I had an e-mail from one of my old overland leaders because it had just dawned on him that we were all going to college and he was wondering where we were going.  Then a lot of the kids had responded to all and it was crazy to hear from kids that I haven't talked to in so long but shared probably one of the most amazing experiences ever with.  I was so blessed to be able to go on three overland trips.  They really were so incredible...I mean how many kids get to spend a month hiking in the rockies, or how many can say that they've biked 800 miles of the Pacific Coast...including the Seattle Rainforests all the way down to the Redwood Forest in California, and then to top it off a third amazing summer biking through the backroads of Spain in the Pyrenees.  I got to see three beautiful places and experience so many things.  Those trips were so fun, and I loved all the kids I met on them, and I realize now that I am genuinely sad that I didn't keep in touch with a lot of them.  But I guess theres not much to do about that now.  At least I still have the memories.

      Last night was fun...  I went to GIGA and then to Kylie Loughrans house and we hung out for a little bit before grabbing the Jessica Simpson cd and getting in my car.  We drove to my house blasting Jessica and singing along, and then had a dance party in my driveway.  It was amazing.  Anyways, then the Goat came over, and then the Rottner.  We hung out for a while and then went to Stamford to see Shrek 2, but alas it was sold out.  So we decided to go to Caffeine in SoNo and I realized that Sono is a place where middle aged people go to party because they're in denial of their age.  It's quite unfortunate if you ask me.  Then I came home cause I was sleepy.  But it was good times.  Oooh and we also saw James and Stella and Matt skating in Stamford and Matt held onto Rottners car as he drove 25mph down the road, it was a little bit scary.    I want to get a nose piercing...nothing big...just a little stud....what do you think?

      Last night Booth, Taylor, Artie and I saw Harry Potter.  I was so excited, but it didn't end up being as good as I'd hoped.  But it was still good, and that Harry Potter...he's dreamy. hahaha.  Taylor claims to be a faithful Ron lover, but I saw her eyeing my man Harry last night.  I told Artie it was ok if he wants to have a crush on Hermoine cause I have a crush on Harry, but he didn't want to.  Oh well.  Man, I'm a loser.    Wow, I just looked at my watch and realized that in three months to the day I will be leaving for college.  Thats crazy business.  I'm so excited but at the same time I dont think the reality of college has set in yet.  I think once I get there I'll miss home a lot more than I think I will right now.  It's going to be so different, but I can't wait.  The end of the year is just dragging on.  I feel like I haven't had a real day of school in forever.  All I do in my ap's is watch movies, my papers been done for 5 days, and besides that I have frees.  I have to come in one period during all of finals week and it's just to watch a movie.  Can I just graduate now? Soon enough...  This week God really showed me something that my sister has always told me, but I never believed.  I realized that I hold way to high of expectations for my friends, especially those who I'm closest to.  And it always ends up hurting me, and then I go and cry to my sister and she tells me every time it's because I expect more out of people then is right.  And it's so true, I need to learn to be realistic and not think anyones perfect, because no one is.  I need to be more accepting of flaws and realize more of my own and work on those.  It feels good to finally realize it on my own, now I just have to fix it.

      Last night was so fun. I believe it was around Friday that Kyle and I got the idea to have a bbq and we set the date as Sunday night.  So yesterday we started spreading the word and got all the preperations.  Then Kyle, Goat and I went to Stanwich and then the bbq was on.  The attendes were: Kyle, Goat, Artie, Taylor, Booth, Rottner, Adam, Meg, Alison Bussey, Katherine, and I think thats all.  It was much fun.  We all sat around and talked for so long which was nice, and some really funny stories were shared.    Today I went and was in the parade for young life and then I came home and fell asleep for 3 1/2 hours which brings me here.  I kinda want to go back to sleep but that wouldn't be good.  This 4 day weekend has been awesome.

      Ok I know I blogged about 10 minutes ago, but my mind got all reeling and I wanted to blog again.    First, Taylor, I agree 10000000000% about remaining true to your blogger roots.  We'll take on this livejournal world together.    I want to expand on my statement about wondering who I'll be close with next year at this time.  In english yesterday a kid was talking about a book he read for his project and the main character in it decided to stop growing up when he was three.  I was thinking about it and I wish that I could stop time right now just for a little longer, because I feel like it's going by so fast.  Everything is so good now, and I dont know if i'm ready to move on, but I have to.  I can't believe high school is over.   I feel like I've had so many different groups of friends throughout high school...sophomore year I hung out with amanda, kyle, goat, bruno, matt, wes, and pete all the time, and then once they left for college my friendships with wes and pete fell away, which makes me sad sometimes.  Then last year was such a transition year, but this year has been so good, and I've loved every minute of it.  I guess part of me is scared of losing what I have now.    It's just scary to think that theres only four years between me and the real world.  I don't know what I want to do with my life, but apparently I have to have it figured out in 4 years.  But I have to stop worrying about the future and just focus on the now, because it'll all work itself out and God is in control.  I have to keep reminding myself of that.

      I love the city at night...  Tuesday night I went into the city for a dinner that my mom bought half a table for.  It was a big banquet for Covenant House which is this christain non-profit organization that takes kids off the streets and out of prostitution and pornography and all this stuff and helps them start over.  It's really cool.  The dinner was at the Waldorf and it was honoring my moms friend Larry Kudlow (does the show Kudlow and Cramer on some news station) because he just joined the board, and when he accepted the award he got up there and like preached it, it was awesome.  He talked about how he'd been addicted to drugs and alcohol and how God helped him overcome it and all these rich new york people sat there and listened.  It was defiantly a good time.    On the car ride home we had an awesome driver, and I had to sit in the front because my mom and her friend were in the back, and all I can say is that this man had the most amazing hair and glasses I've ever seen.  And he used to design beauty salon chairs if that gives you any hint about his personality.  But driving through the city at night was awesome, for some reason it seems so strangely peaceful and beautiful.  I enjoyed it very much.   I didn't go to school today, because I didn't have any real classes.  I didn't see the point, told my mom, and she agreed.   Tonight is senior club, I'm nervous to talk, but I think it'll be ok.  I think this is the last club...thats crazy...my young life high school career is over.  I think the realization of graduation and everyone leaving is starting to hit me.  I wonder who I'll still be close with this time next year.    Next Friday my sister, Kyle, and I are going to see Jessica Simpson in concert because we're crappy like that.  It's going to be amazing.

      It is so nice to have no exams...I basically have a 6 day vacation before returning to school to graduate.  Yesterday was nice, I woke up late and then Artie came over when his exam was done, then my sister, kyle and i hung out ate coldstone and saw stepford wives.  It was really funny, but kinda scary how many parts I was like..that's just what Dariens like! Anyways, then today I woke up at 11:15..that is so late for me! Today I hung out with taylor and artie and went swimming, and then when Artie went to football taylor and I stayed for like an extra hour and had good talk. And then tonight natalie and i are kickboxing and katherine and i are getting coldstone.  Sounds good to me.    FRIDAY NIGHT IS JESSICA!!!!!! hahaha I'm so excited.  It is going to be   amazing hahahaha, I can't wait.    The other night I got really sad about all the sexual corruption there is in my school.  It makes me so sad to see these girls that just give their bodies away and these guys who treat them like objects.  I just wish they could see how much more they're worth in Gods sight, and how much what they're doing now is going to hurt them.    I still can't believe I graduate on Tuesday...To take a moment and sound totally cliche...it went by so fast.  But it was amazing overall.  I didn't think I'd really changed though but last night my sister and I had a long talk and she pointed out to me how much I've changed and how when I first got to high school I was so eager to fit in and be accepted by everyone, but now she was saying I'm more myself, and not as willing to change that to fit in, and I'm ok with not being friends with everyone.  It made me happy to hear that because it makes me feel like I've become stronger.  I love my sister so much, it makes me so happy to be able to go into her room before I go to bed or have her come in mine and just talk before I fall asleep...she's the best sister in the universe.    I am just blabbing on...so I'm going to go and enjoy this beautiful day and leave you (if anyone still reads this?) with some lyrics from a singer who Kyle told me about who I enjoyed very much, and her name is Mindy Smith.    When you're bilndsided and decieved And chained to the floor When it's diffucult to see Riding on the world  Keep on believing God is Soaring above a world that is Running out of love Pouring hope out over us  His angel doves  When it's hard for you to breathe Keep a clear mind When it's hard for you to be Just to be yourself sometimes  Keep on believing God is Soaring above a world that is Running out of love Pouring hope out over us  His angel doves  Truly believing God is Soaring above a world that is Running out of love Pouring hope out over us  His angel , His angel, His angel His angel doves  - "Angel Doves" Mindy Smith

      So I guess I'm graduating today...  I can't believe high school is over...I'll never have another passing time, or free, or common time..any of that stuff that was so much a part of my life for the past 4 years.  Unfortunately I realized, especially these past 2 days at graduation rehersal, that there aren't many people in my grade that I can say I'll truly miss.  I guess it's just weird to think it's over, and these people that I've grown up with since 4th grade are leaving and I'll never see most of them again.    I put on my cap and gown for my sister and I think thats when it started to hit me that this is real...and that in 3 hours I'll be graduating.  I don't think I ever thought college would really come. It just seemed so far away and so big, but now I'm going in 2 1/2 months.  Am I ready for college? I hope so.  I'm blabbing on, I should go and get ready.     Goodbye high school....

      This summer seems so different from last summer.  It just has a different feel to it.  I know last summer was full of drama and stuff like that, but there was something about last summer that I loved, and I'm not feeling it this summer.  It's funny how you can look back on something that had so much bad but only see the good.  Thats how I feel about last summer, I know there was a lot of bad stuff going on but when I look back on it all I see is the best summer of my life with my three best friends.  I think subconsciously part of me is detaching myself from everything so that it won't be hard to go to college.  I realized I've really been clinging to God, which is a good thing.  This is the closest I've felt to him in so long.  I don't want to lose that.  I'm going to post the lyrics to the song I'm listening to right now because I like them.  The songs by Mindy Smith and she wrote the song when her mom was dying of cancer, it literally gave me chills the first time I heard it. Anyways, I'm in a weird mood.    Oh, and the last night of Creation during Newsboys who preformed last...there were 6 shooting stars in a row that went all the way across the entire sky, it was so beautiful and so God saying hello.  It was amazing.     "Hold me Even though I know you're leaving And show me All the reasons you would stay It's just enough to feel your breath on mine To cool my soul and ease my mind You've go to hold me and show me love  Give me  Just one part of you to cling to  And keep me Everywhere you are It's just enough to steal a heart and run And fade out with the fooling sun  Oh, please don't go Let me have you just one moment more Oh, all I need All I want is just one moment more You've got to hold me and keep me  Tell me that someday you'll be returning And maybe Maybe I'll be here It's just enough to see a shooting star To know you're never really far It's just enough to see a shooting star To know you're never really gone  Oh, please don't go Let me have you just one moment more Oh, all I need All I want is just one moment more  Oh, please don't go Let me have you just one moment more Oh, all I need All I want is just one moment more You've got to hold me and maybe I'll believe  So hold me  Even though I know you're leaving"  -Mindy Smith

      Hellllo....well the 4th of July was great, got to see lots of fireworks and from the water so it was fabulous.  I've been babysitting so much, I think I might go crazy.  I feel like maternal instincts that shouldn't kick in until I'm in my 30's are surfacing, it makes me nervous.    Today Kyle, her friend Anna from North Carolina, Andrew Rottner, and Christian Rottner went and saw an I-MAX about the ocean. It was so super cool. Then I went grocery shopping.  I don't really have anything to blog about.    Bye bye!

      I just realized that the biggest problem in my relationship with God is my unwillingness to feel uncomfortable, or do something I don't want to do.&nbsp; It's like I can create this faith that fits my needs so well, but completely ignores the desires of God for my life.&nbsp; I make a faith that conforms to the standards and expectations I have for my life.&nbsp; And then when I hit dry patches and wonder why I'm not growing, the thought creeps into my mind that maybe it's because I'm not truly living the life God is calling me to, but then I just push that thought aside and resolve that I need to spend more time in prayer or something.&nbsp; But thats not what it's about, faith in God and&nbsp; a relationship with Christ isn't about just having a daily quiet time and not swearing or whatever, it's about living your life knowing that he is all that matters, and sharing that with as many people as possible.&nbsp; So why do I waste my time doing anything else? Why do I try to make it into something else? Why is it so easy for me to love all these earthly things so much more then I love God?  &nbsp; I feel change coming on in my heart, and I feel like now is the best possible time for it.&nbsp; I'm sick of saying that I want a life serving God and then watching opportunities pass me by.&nbsp; I want to be bold, I want to be real, I want to have faith that changes this world.&nbsp; I want to let go of this world...scripture says Christ has saved us from this world, so why do I hold onto it? What can it possibly offer me that God hasn't already conquered? I have to let go of myself and my plan for life, because deep down I know I will never be satisfied until I do that.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I was reading this book a couple days ago and it talked about focusing on the cross, and absorbing how deep our need for it truly is.&nbsp; The author made the point of saying that when we sin it's stupid of us to say things like, "I can't believe I did that, I never thought I could do that" because we can...look at the cross, it's proof we can do the worst&nbsp;thing&nbsp;imaginable...&nbsp;kill the Son of God.&nbsp; But it's also proof that God loves us enough to use that act as something that opens the door between us and him.&nbsp; He said that we have to stop looking at ourselves as basically good, and instead as inately evil, and it's when that occurs that our need&nbsp;for a savior becomes so apparent, our ability to accept his forgiveness so much easier, and the scope of his love so incredible.&nbsp; I don't know if that's exactly what he said but thats what I got out of it.&nbsp; It made me realize I need to stop thinking I can do things that are good enough to get by in God's eyes, and instead humble myself to realizing that I am at his mercy, and without him there is nothing good about me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Clearly, I need work.&nbsp; And why I just decided to blog all of that I don't know, but maybe if anyone still reads this, they'll get something out of it, or maybe it's just senseless babbling that only makes sense to me.&nbsp;

      This weekend was fun. Saturday night I catered a party and the theme was Stepford Wives...it was scary how everyone looked.  Everyone went all out and these women looked like they walked out of the freakin movie, and for any of you who have seen the movie and know the scene with all the cupcakes...they had cupcakes allllll over the kitchen and people brought even more.  I've never seen so many cupcakes in one place at one time.   Then yesterday Andrew, Taylor, Artie and I went out on Arties boat and waterskied (they were all much more sucessfull than I was). But still it was fun times.  Minus the working a lot this summer has turned out pretty entertaining.

      I'm off to Block Island tomorrow for 16 whole days.&nbsp; The first 8 I'm with a family babysitting and the second 8 I'm with the Van Scivers.&nbsp; So if anyone out there feels inclined to call me and entertain me, especially the first 8 days...I'll appreciate it very much, especially now that I have my new spiffy phone.&nbsp; I hope that anyone who reads this has a very nice next 16 days and I'll see ya when I get back.&nbsp;
