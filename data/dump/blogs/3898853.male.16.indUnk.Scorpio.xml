      Ok that might sound weird a boring but fun day although it was. I met up with John at the park bout 12.05, im always 5 minutes late for some reason. Anyways the others had not shown up yet, typical! So me n redman decided we should meet them, Laura Ryan n Jamie, at the back of our old, but going back, to school. I couldnt be arsed walking so redman gave us a sadle to meet them. Once we met up with them we took a walk into pudsey centre where Laura went into my work place n bought some drinks and i bought some shortbread biscuits, now you gotta be mad not to like shortbread biscuits and no one i know doesnt like shortbread biscuits...Afterwards we went to the park and sat down by benches for abit, where gary s met up with us. I got bored in less than 5 mins, i dont know why but i did. Not long after my pa gave me a ring telling me that my cousin from kent had drove all the way up here to give us a visit. So i ended up leaving my mates n met up with my cousin Chris and his girlfriend Becky. We talked for while and caught up on a few things, had a laugh n all. I cant be arsed typing anymore so ill be brief. Afterwards i met up with John, Ryan and Jamie and we went to Redmans, we always end up going to redmans, why the hell is that? i dunno. So we went to redmans where i stayed for less than an hour n went home for my tea. Afterwards i came online n decided to write this thingy.  Im going to listen to some music now.  Later Days Ow and my arse still hurts...on the left cheek...

      Yesterday we went bowling at Hollywood bowl for Lauras birthday and it was great, it was kinda lucky i could of gone cos i had to change my working hours in short notice; thankfully sam, the dep manager of the store, let me work 10-6 instead of 12-8 so i could go bowling, shes very kind. We all met up at 7:30, as usually i was like 5 minutes late but it dint matter too much. When I arrived with John we met up with Laura, Leanne and Ryan. We all talked a lil bit then went to play bolwing. We kinda realised Jamie hadnt arrived yet so we waited for him to arrive so we could start bowling. I also got a strike on my first bowl again! Im kinda good at that then it all goes down hill from there...ow well. Some reason we all found it highly amusing to chuck bits of ice from our slush puppy at each other...dont ask y we did it but it was fun though. It was also alot of fun putting people off before they bowled. Ryan generally snuck behind em n pretended to bowl, which was kinda offputting. I tried ringing john but he got a spare! so i dint try that again. When laura went to bowl i touched her arse n i tell you that did put her off! Anyways in bowling from first to last this is how it finished,   John  Ryan  Johnny  ME  Laura  Jamie   Leanne didnt want to play for some reason or another but i decided to call her a bore just for a laugh. After bowling we went to the arcade we we pretty much played on the air hockey for about an hour. I WAS DEFEATED! NOOOOOO!!!!! Leanne is very good at&nbsp; air hockey but lost to johnny some how...John seemed to get hit by the air puck alot, especially when he played me, i get abit voilent with the puck you see. John beat me in the last game he had with me but i couldnt stop laughing when the puck hit him, i was creasing myself i could barely stand. We then ended up get one of them photos in a booth where it draws it for you. They looked pretty good n as usual, Jamie looked Gormless in the picture. We headed for McDonalds about 10ish as we were ery hungry by then. We talked about random crap in there n had a laugh. We went outside of McDonalds afterwards as some ppl we was&nbsp;getting picked up, unlike me n redman we was getting the bus home. And it was blody freezing out side, n i mean freezing. Laura was kind enough to stand next to me and gave me a hug to keep me warm, and likewise i gave her a hug to keep her warm, cheers as well laura. Leanne was also freezing so redman was nice enough to keep her warm. Ryan n johnny got picked up practically straight away so they dint feel the icy chill of the night. Laura then realised bout 20 mins after we had bin outside that the pictures from the booth were still inside McDonalds!!!She went inside to retrieve em and found out a staff member had binned em, did they look like rubbish u stupid get!! She came back out, bit gutted bout the pictures bit she dint let it ruin her nite. We all snuggled up again till laura got picked up and she dropped jamie off aswell. There was just John, Leanne n me left, leanne was shortly after picked up by her dad. Then me n redman walked to the bus stop and then that was the end of the night. I must say i had a great time and i believe that everyone else did as well  Also its Lauras birthday today, HAPPY BIRTHDAY Laura.   Im off to get ready now as im off to Andys soonish.  Laters  Liam

      I found this on andother blog and i think that it's quite good and a good idea sumtimes  Life cycle   The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A death. What's that, a bonus? I think the life cycle is all backwards.  You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you live in an old age home. You get kicked out when you're too young, you get a gold watch, you go to work. You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You drink, you party, you get ready for high school. You go to grade school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little baby, you go back into the womb, you spend your last nine months floating... you finish off as an orgasm.   Thanks to ru, ze whore for this, cos it is a perplexing (thats a long word) idea.  Parallel universes or just a good orrigional thaught... i not got a clue  n e ways just a bit of fun to think about ... erm i think....  Popups are random  Redman

Sick, exilerated and stuffed...   A day in the life of me and macoronies ... my cronies ... get it??... doesnt matter (my m8s lol!)   liam (pain for pleasure, hurt his arse yesterday and kept poking the bruise to see how much it hurt today!! lol, dumass)   laura s, (my ex, who i still like quite a lot, and she sumhow keeps bumping her head every day, for no aparrent reason, the funniest being i rang her and she jumped out of the bath onto the tiled floor, slid into the wall, then stood up, fell over and ended up sprawled in a heap across the parents floor after hitting her head on the bed post!!! lol, wat a girl!!)   jamie t (he gave me a nokia bouncy fone and sed pay us the £25 for it wen you can cos your fone is fucked, **cant go wrong with that i thaught**)    gary s, (the lunatic but funny random-like person, who evbery body has 1 of these in there group of friends  and    ryan, the sorted kind with the long hair and is cool, no matter what he does or wat he wares, (including the g-string that he wore at my party, and scared the pizza delivery man off with)  Laura and gary went home , walking together, considering that they dont get on (laura doesnt like gary) thats a prety good achievement, me liam jamie and ryan went to our house... played thps3 for a bit, and break danced in the back garden, (minus liam who went home for his dinner at 6.45)  We played who can bail the most and make it look proper seriously bad and get up and walk away from it, ryan took the buscuit and the oscar for his performance; landing a cartwheel backwards, clicking his neck, landing on his knee, and sumhow nackering his elbow... he got up limping off saying "Im ok, honest!!..", and colapsing on the grass again, he'll be a cracking actor wen he grows up, and probably play for portugal aswell...  Footy joke  Ronaldo at the gates of heaven St david says, ronaldo, what are you doing here and why do you want to enter heaven?? he says, well i kinda got battered by a crowd of angry people, but the thing is i want to come into heaven as i play good football from the heart and with the knowledge of god in my mind. St david says ok, you can enter heaven  then roberto carlos comes to the pearly gates St david says, roberto carlos, what are you doing here and why do you want to enter heaven??  Roberto carlos says well i was killed by the crowd that battered ronaldo but i believe in the "beutiful game and that the spirit of football rests firmly in the hands of god..  St david says ok, you can enter heaven  The David beckham comes up the the gates  St david says, David beckham, well i never, what are you doing here and why do you want to enter heaven??  Erm beckham says i dont, could i just have the football back  Der dum chhhhh lol, I laffed, but if your not from england and your reading this then you probs wont understand, (look at the england verses portugal match higlights on the penalties and youll understand Y england are souch a poor fotty team (even if i do have the flag up inmy room window still, and the footy finished like 2 weeks ago!!))

      I'm back   ** a random person comes up to me and says "I dint notice that you went away, "come" to think of it, i dont think n e 1 did..." then walks off to the back of the auditorium and the door slams behind them...**  Theres been quite a lot happen in the last 2 or 3 days that I havent updated on here, cos of 2 reasons, 1, been on burnout 2 on my ps2 and out with my mates!!! whoosh, its nice to have friends...  Laura has like 2 or 3 contracts for modeling pending, (good luck to ya girl, you got the lucks, just have they got the vacany for you to fill...) I got a job!!! YEEEAAAAYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! Im over the moon, i got a placement at safeways (now morrisons) at swinnow lights, and I start next tuesday hopefully. Im well looking forwartd to it, cash and seeing sum of my mates:  (trolley boy jonnie hahahaha wat a nickname, I like that.... lol and   Gary H, Looks like hes a boxer or sumat (-the flat nose), but hes as tame as a pigeon in the centre of leeds (no hes noit a scratter, hes a kickass mate of mine)   and laura *well fit* heart I hope she has got the placement aswell,   and danny pollard, my only opposition to asking out laura h, I dont care n e way, if he goes with her, good on him, cos hes a ginner, and thats very rare (apart from leanne) to be dicent as him and leanne k are ok... I known him for ages (6yrs) so hes cool...  My bike is still in the shop... I dont know what hes doing to it, but i think its a new derailer that hes ordered (he being the shop owner called Paul (thats also the name of my best skater m8 from the other side of Leeds, I havent seen him in a while and im on holiday with hima and my (sorted) uncle gary, and well sussed auntie von&nbsp;at the end of august and sumtime in november.. there like my mom and dads best mates aswell... I cant wait...  Then we turn to today, andme having to ride into hgeadingly from my house, (on the racing bike (40 mph with NO, thats right, NO BRAKES!!!! Its a deathtrap in the making, i had to use my trainers to stop me, solid (in a bag on a skateboard) to ride without experiance, as ryan forund out day before yesterday, (I hope jamie was ok, he had an epileptic fit at our house, (spoiling his yawn),&nbsp; and came arround after a while, ryan has discovered that he is INCREDIBLY good at burnout 2 crash mode... Very sussed if i say so myself...  Gary, liam, tony and her b/f (phsyco guy who slit his wrists wen he was high, before the geography exam) walked through the tunnle from black carr woods to the white cross pub, (something was in there infront of them, but who knows wat it was cos it wasnt there wen they came out the other end... SpOoKy!!!! lol **sed in a creepy voice**  I oped out of it and instead i played snake and pinball untill they got to the other end and then ran over to them and scared the withs out of liam and gary h cos they were still on edge from walking through the tunnle, even though they saw me coming and i waveds and whistled, (the only time you can scare liam is wen hes like that after being spooked for something... It was kinda funny though, he proper shat his pants bigtime!!! lol  Like i sed i rode to headingly and almost colapsed on kirkstall road cos its like a huge hill and its proper steep, and i MEAN steep... I rode up it half way and then got off the racing bike (which is old (about 20 yrs id say) and practicaly falling apart, with no brakes and is built for flat/downhill road racing... hot and sweaty, practicaly for nothing in the end cos it turns out to open a new account in a bank for my new jobs wage... but it was bollox so i rode into leeds, almost nocking over a couple of yids (japanese or chinese tourists) and a group of (rather fat) women with a lot of shopping bags, and a couple with prams (they needed them to carry there bellies arround in!!! lol)  I gave up at the station and pushed it from computer exchange to the taxi rank, whilst almost being run over by a bloody packi taki driver (well they are all pakies nower days, If NF got there way, we wouldnt have any taxis, iced creem vans, curry houses or corner (rip you off) shops or n e thing remotly related to packies...) I got on the train, and then now here I am, after a trip into headingly and then leeds, a prawn mayo sarni and a bottle of coke, and thats that for another day, im going to either play burnout 2 for a bit and complete it tonight (I wish...) or stay on here and immerse myself into msn for a bit, i just dont know... probs the first optio, **hi to zoe whos on msn at the moment...**   N e way, I bid you farewell for a bit  Idea for the day: Sex is like a game of bridge: If you don't have a good partner, you'd better have a good hand  lol, kicking ass yet agen  Redman

She went and me and liam walked for the bus,   there was a crowed of girls along the way that i whistled at **you would redman - liam**  then to the bus stop, penman and his mates were at the stop with 2 giirls that theyd picked up from the evo by tho looks of it **lets go pull some 12 year olds... lol** and home to a deserted house and a bed with my name on it (not literally)...
