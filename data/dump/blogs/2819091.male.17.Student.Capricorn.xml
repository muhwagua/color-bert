       PAROKYA NI EDGAR: TRACK 17   It took one look Then forever laid out in front of me One smile and I died Only to be revived by you  There I was Thought I had everything figured out Goes to show just how much i know 'bout the way life plays out...  Chorus: I take one step away Then i find myself coming back to you My one and only, one and only you...Ooh...  Now I know  That I know not a thing at all Except the fact that I am yours And that you are mine  Ooh  They told me that this wouldn't be easy And know  I'm not one to complain...  (Chorus 2X)  you..

      Forever floating in this sea of darkness, there is no one with me, no one to guide me...  Is there anyone out there?  Will you help me in this darkness?  I don't want to be alone anymore...  I want someone to share this journey with me within the sea of darkness...  Help me through...  Being alone in this darkness isn't what it used to be anymore.  No one to swim together in this peaceful but vast waters.  Please swim with me, I'd like to have someone with me to travel with...  I, who once loved being alone, now long for a friendship, a companionship with someone...  Please help me...  I no longer want to drift away in this sadness and loneliness...  I want to drift away with you...  My friend, my ally, my supporter.  Let's swim away from the sadness and find happiness for us, for we will travel anew...  Together...  THE END

      I love you...  You will never get to know how much I do because you are gone...  The pain of knowing that you are no longer here hurts me up to the fact that I didn't get to know you very well...  You left without even saying goodbye and I hated that...  I wanted to know more about you but I was denied of the chance...  Damn it!  Why haven't I done anything to prevent it...  Now you are gone and I could never see you again.  I thought that we'll remain in contact with each other, no matter what but distance really drew us apart...  Now all I could do is reminisce about what happened between us and daydream what might have happened...  Damn you...  How could you have such an effect on me, I met and saw so many beautiful women and girls in my life that it shouldn't even bother me anymore but you really left this hole in me...  Your beauty, your kindness, the way that you initiated a conversation with me, you always gave me a hug while most girls just don't notice me at all or basically snob at me...  I should hate you for that but I don't...  I keep on loving you because you were the one that gave me this happiness of having a girl finally noticing me despite my appearance...  The fact that you noticed made me content with who I was, despite the fact that I will never be good-looking or that I never deserved such a happiness as to have met you...  You talked to me...  You've given me so much while I haven't given anything at all...  You, who were so generous as to have given so many experiences and happiness, deserve to receive so many beautiful things in this world...  I should have been able to give you something for your work but I was too selfish...  All I could do now is contemplate about what I have done wrong and that I never gave you anything, only idiotic things, what a fool I am...  Please forgive me for what I have done, you never deserved such mistreatment but I gave it to you...  I'm so sorry.  I want to make it up to you if ever we meet again...  Whether it's this life or on another...  I will recompensate anything that I am able to just to see you as happy and content as I was when I first met you when you gave me a truly memorable hug...  The hug given to me by the most beautiful girl that I have ever met in my whole life.  The one that I keep on dreaming to see someday again...

      Please don't think of me as one who loves to be pitied...  I just wanted to use this Gambit picture because I believe that memories will haunt you, torment you, hurt you...  As all of you Gambit fans or comic book readers know, some of Monsieur LeBeau's past are still unrevealed.  Some memories did surface, which caused him and others close to him like Rogue, for example, to suffer.  His involvement in the Morlock Massacre and the death of another woman he loved because of Sabretooth...  Those memories haunted him, nearly killing him.  Those were painful memories that he bore...  Death, murder, suffering, pain, hate, love, indifference...  Anyway...  My point is that we all had painful memories.  My memories might not be as worse as yours but it did hurt...  That's why I wanted to use this picture...  I wanted a picture that signified that I had painful memories like Gambit, not exactly in his caliber, but to me it was torture.  That's why I wanted to use this picture and believe that some memories,even ones that might seem small, hurt.  I hope that you will understand the concept that I'm talking about and myself for thinking this way, no matter how idiotic or pathetic my way of thinking is.

      Currently thinking of Hoobastank's "The Reason" lyrics...  Powerful, this damn song causes me to reflect upon myself and what I have done lately.  The song touches my soul in a way...  That I am basically thinking of her again.  What she has done probably looks small in the perspective of others, but to me, she was an angel that lit up my whole life.  Her actually talking to me was such a great gift that I couldn't help but feel gracious for...  Damn.  I told myself not to dwell on this anymore but music does really put me down.  Making me think only about her and her beauty, her kindness, her kindred soul.  Damn it.  I don't want this anymore, I don't want to feel love for another knowing that it'll never work.  I now hate love.  I hated how it made me change just so I could get her attention and make her like me for what I'm trying to be for her.  Why did this have to happen?  I'm so confused, I want to feel love but I don't want it due to how fate will come between it and everything.  If anyone has an answer, please tell me...  Relieve me of this confusion so that I could focus on my life again instead of her.

      No more sounds, no more music...  Basically, almost everything that I sense reminds me of her...  Why did I have to meet her?  Did the fates just make us meet each other, to make me so deeply in love with her, so that they could laugh at me for how horribly pathetic I am?  Damn them...  From now on, why can't they just leave me alone?  I must try not to be infatuated with the opposite sex any longer, I've already learned my lesson.  Time to move on, time to finally realize that I was meant to be alone.  I was fortunate enough to have been given friends but as for partners, I believe I was never granted that privilege.  That's why I am currently nay, no longer attracted to anyone.  I still am attracted but I know that I could only admire from afar or else doomed to see someone I am in love with leave my life again.  This is my destiny, to walk this damned path without anyone else but myself, this is the destiny I choose.  The Path of Nay...

      Nothing seems to impress you, huh?  I've been trying my best at basically everything that I do and try to impress you while doing that but you still show anger towards me...  You think that I never poured any of my time for this.  It never works, does it?  Everything I've tried hard to accomplish, everything I do, you just throw it away like it was just trash.  It's never good enough for you.  You want me to be something that I could never be,someone that is perfect.  Don't you understand that in the end, all that I can do and all that I am will always be that way...  Just ME!  Why can't you understand that or see with your own goddamn eyes that I could never be the one you want me to be.  Why can't your stupid fucked-up mind ever perceive that?  I'm not you, I'm not someone who you want me to be, I'm me...  ME, Fucker!  What do I have to do to make you understand that?  I've tried my best the whole time and it doesn't seem to get through your thick head about what I 'm trying to show, God damn you!  If you are truly the perfect person that you make me believe you are, how come your smart mind cannot grasp the fact that I could never be the one you want me to be?  Can't you see that I've been trying to impress you all along?  For once in your fucking perfect life, appreciate what I've done that has been good and great, I know that I've created a lot of mistakes but I have been trying to atone for all of that, I'm sorry for the wrongs that I've done, I'm sorry for not being able to be a perfect son, I'm sorry if I'm not one of the greatest friends, but can't you just love me without any attached ends?  I feel so sick of being almost like your goddamn puppet, your bitch, that I just want to die.  I don't want to live anymore with you being so constricting on me, I no longer feel free.  I no longer feel that I am important in this world.  I want to live but not when I feel that I have chains dangling all over me.  Please, Lord, if you're up there, take my life away, relieve me of this misery you call "Life."

      Here I am...  Alone again, no one to speak to except my subconscious thoughts.  I dive deep to search for memories that I have held dear in my heart, reminiscing of  her  beauty...  How I constantly wish to be with her, she is so beautiful yet out of reach, all I can do is try to make friends with her; hoping that she will like me; hoping that she'll come near me; eternally hoping for a dream, a fantasy...  Wishing endlessly for a farfetched fantasy to come true.  Why can't I let go?  She is gone; I know that she has someone else in mind, someone who is her exact equal, someone who is beautiful...  Not someone as hideous as I.  Damn it...  Why can't I let go?  If only I could erase my memories, remove her from my mind, delete her whole existence out of my life, I will finally let her go...  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.  Yes...  A new dawn that'll finally let me live my life as it were before I met her, meeting her was like a curse, a damnation in my life.  Her everlasting kindness that strengthened and brightened my day, the hugs that she gave me...  She was the only girl that ever shared the beautiful feeling of love and friendship with this hideous monster.  How beautiful this friendship was...  Though this monster knew it wouldn't last; the beautiful angel that graced her presence with the monstrosity was leaving.  Damn it...  The monster swore at the Fates for this predicament, the monster had become too well-adjusted with the angel that he couldn't bear to become alone all over again.  The angel would not do anything about it since she never knew about the monster's feelings for her that she left without thinking twice about her friendship with the monster.  The monster couldn't do anything anymore...  She had already left without saying goodbye.  Damn her kindness, her friendship...  The monster was alone all over again in this cold, barren wasteland without anyone that the monster could spend his entire life with.  Only loneliness...  Damn her.

      My refuge... Whenever I am in here, I feel that I am in my safe place, my sanctuary from the accursed real world... This is my drug, my escape. When I exit from this place; I want to cry, the harshness of the real world pains me so. The people who may seem friendly and beautiful are actually monsters in hiding. They who hurt those who may seem lower than them, though, in actuality, they are all equals. They, who feel that they are superior are nothing but liars and fools, trying to attain some sort of god-like rank among their fellow people. It's painful to see past these fake truths, it hurts so bad... Why can't I just be a superficial fool? At least I won't feel people's pain anymore. Please help me... I don't want to live in the real world anymore where people could hide as beautiful beings, yet in actuality, these majestic beings are truly hideous monsters... In my room, where I lie so sadly, I see a foreboding light from a screen, it draws me near to it, it's hypnotizing power drew me ever closer. I see inside it, people who are not able to judge people superficially but judge them for what they truly are. They act as a family like those you see in movies where there is a powerful bond between them. These groups only judge their people on how they act and how they are, not by their looks... I'm overjoyed to see that I'm able to join this place, which has now become my refuge and my strength, my happiness... THE END

      Blank... My thoughts are blank, How pathetic is that? Trying to think but it's blank. All blank...  Hahah. Wow... No thoughts, No recollection, No idea. Clueless. Clueless as that girl I know, Then again I didn't even let it show. Now, I'm blank... No longer thinking, No longer paying attention. Always in a daze, Feeling like I'm in a maze. So confused, My mind has been abused For such a long time. I need rest... Yes, that's what I need... A long rest, relaxation... Give my mind bliss... Bliss.

      I once swam in the sea of darkness, no one cared, no one knew. no one saw. I was drowning yet no one cared... Until you came... you rescued me when I was dying. You came to my rescue when no one else would. Thank you... I owe you my life for your heroism, I am in debt to you for your reaching out, I felt love for the first time because you cared. I wanted to ask you if we could swim together, overcome this sea of darkness, turn it to light. You refused... You told me you had to leave... You showed me that you didn't even care, I felt like you pushed me back into the sea, even though, in reality, I was overcome, the darkness taking over me. Swallowing me. Drowning me. I was unable to breathe. I tried to fight it but it came to no avail, I swam as hard as I could yet I couldn't. It was always pulling me, throwing me off. I then started wondering why you even bothered... Rescuing me even though you ended up drowning me. Why did you bother to save me in the first place when your goal was to kill me anyway? I was already drowning anyway... All you had to do was wait for awhile. I realized something... You wanted to scar me, didn't you? Deepen my mortal wound... Nearly to the brink of death. Damn you, how could you be so cruel? I thought you were my angel yet you truly proved I was wrong. I felt so deceived... I cried for a long time, and then I laughed... I laughed.  How stupid I was...To think that you were my friend yet you never were. How could I have been so dumb as to have fallen for that. Stupid... Moronic... Pathetic... As I knew this, I felt that I wasn't engulfed by the darkness anymore... It was always at my side, showing me the truth behind the deceit and lies.  It never bended anything at all... I was only deceived by those who I thought cared for me... Liars... Deceivers... Falsifiers... You called yourself the light, you are only propagandists! Damn you all... Deceiving everyone, hurting everyone, lying to everyone... How cruel your treatments were. Cruel. Just so cruel. I relinquish my faith about everything. From now on, I seek my own truths... My own beliefs... NOT to be overcome by your deceit and lies. I choose to be forsaken from faith and all its ideologies. No more. -- -- -- It is too late for me to return anywhere, I renounce everything even my own beliefs, all because of how deceitful they are. Damn them. I don't know even what's right anymore... All I know is... That I'm overcome.

      Death... Will it give me comfort or pain? Will it make me insane? When I die, will it rain Like the movies? When a great character dies or is slain, The setting begins to rain. Am I even consider a great character? Am I worthy enough to be great? What will death give me in exchange? What kind of deal could we arrange? I've had it with the hate, I've had it with the torture, I've had it with the depression, I've had it with everything. What will I get for giving up? I'm damned to be tormented when I am alive, Either way I'm damned when I am dead, So what choice will I have? All I know is that I am damned either way...

      I sit in my chair, Thinking, thinking... Not even blinking. Always wondering...  What would it be like if was charming?  Always imagining...  What if I was good-looking?  Always day-dreaming...  What if I wasn't the one cowardly screaming?  I know that this is pathetic,  I know that this is wrong.  Yet I find myself doing it. Thinking, thinking...  Always dreaming...  Never ending. I mustn't think like this anymore, I've had it...  I keep on saying it like I mean this.  I must move on.  I always say it, yet I don't really it.  She is gone...  No, she'll always be with us... In memories.  Damn it, why can't I live?! Why can't I breathe?  I do live and breathe... Only difference is... I'm in restraints.  Damn it...  Damn.

      Repetition... It's always the same. I talk the same... That's why no one listens to the lame. I wear the usual... Yet everyone has been so tired with the casual. It's always the same... I'm always the one who is lame.  Damn it all... Damn them all. Yet... In reality, The one that needs to be blamed is me.  I can't change myself, I can't be better, I can't be charming, Yet... I can't stop transforming. I want to be loved, I want to be noticed, I want to be the one who has the charm, I want to be the one who is warm. I want to be everything you want me to be.  People have told me that if I would be myself... I would be loved by the people around me. Yet that is so lame, That is what I am trying to blame... Being myself is lame.

      Inspiration: AfterImage: "Without You"   Without you there is no sunshine, Without you only rain, And even if there is tomorrow, I hope to ease my pain.   I know that you are no longer here, Yet I imagine you in my arms. We were never really close, I know, That never stopped me, though... From being in love with you so.  What am I going to do? Where else could I go, My world was based around you. Fate dealt me a heavy blow, Now I am in an emotional low.  You were my sunshine when my world was in rain, You were my comfort when I felt pain, You were my pride when I was in shame, You extinguished my maddening flame, When I desired to have someone to maim. Now that you are gone, I no longer feel the same.  I hope to ease my pain, Even if there is tomorrow... Without you.

      In this place of darkness, There is no comfort, there is no injury, It neither has anger nor sorrow, Just this feeling inside. It neither has pain nor torture, Just this certain feeling inside you. It neither has happiness nor contentment, Just this feeling inside that you can't describe. It neither has love nor hate, Just this certain indescribable feeling.  What is that feeling? you couldn't tell whether it hurts or comforts. If the feeling is anger or sorrow, Or if it is love or hatred. What is this feeling that bothers us so much? This feeling that you couldn't ignore. Always there bothering you, Always there when you don't want it to. You contemplate that feeling for as long as you like, You have the eternity to figure it out.

      Time to finally move on, No need to look back. The future is coming, I must be prepared. I can't look back anymore, No use looking at her. No use at all. The future is coming for me, I must be ready and prepared. Whatever it has stored for me, I must face it without hesitation, Without any distraction. I must not waste my time -- -- -- -- Yet... -- -- -- -- I can't help but look at her, Her beauty, her friendship towards me, Her kindness, her... I tried to persuade myself that it was fake, I tried to persuade myself that she was just a heart ache. Yet I couldn't believe what I was saying... I frighteningly shivered at my cold thoughts... How could I have thought of her like that? She was never fake, she was real... She was my friend... She left... She is no longer here. Yet I can't let go of her in my memories, She is permanent, She is an engraving placed in my mind. She could never be erased. -- -- -- -- I couldn't stop shivering,  I kept on thinking about her. I fall to the floor, I couldn't get up. Here I was thinking that I was ready for my future, Yet I couldn't be any more wrong than I've ever been. I keep on looking back, The past keeps on disturbing me, The memories of her distract me, The mistakes I've made keep on reminding me, It was futile, I keep on looking back... To her, my past, my mistakes, everything... I am not ready... To let go of them. I am not able... To get rid of them. I am not ready...  For my future... Without them...  Constantly racing inside my mind.

      I'm still here, Don't you fear. Why are you still afraid? I told you that I'm here. You told me I was ugly, That's why you were terrified.  I know that I am ugly, But you shouldn't flee. That's what destiny made me be. I have no scorn, no regret, no sorrow, Because I will always follow What events will bring me tomorrow.  If I ever lived in regret, I never would have met Such a beautiful person like you. I know that my appearance cannot woo Someone as beautiful as you, But this I promise to you, I'll always be there whenever you need someone to talk to.  No matter how far we are, You know that I'll never be far. You could give a call, And you could depend on me that no wall Will ever let our friendship fall. I will always be in the same place, So if ever you need me, There's no need to trace, I will always be at my base Waiting for you. Always waiting... Never stopping.

       MATTEA DUQUETTE  Mattea Duquette, That name haunts me every moment of my living days. Chills my soul in many stirring ways, Her beauty, her charm; How she reached to me with an open arm... How she gave me such emotions warm To feel...  I can't believe it... Could this be real?  Mattea Duquette, How I wished I never met you... Yet in years forgotten, I wished to meet someone like you. What should I do? I want to remember you yet I want to forget you too. I want to forget you as easily as you have forgotten me, I want to forget everything, for this feeling wouldn't leave me be. I try to move on with my life, Yet the memories of you penetrate through me like a sharp knife.  Please... Could anyone tell me how I could be able to forget her As easily as she has forgotten me... I want all of her memories in my head to flee... Forever. I want to say goodbye, yet my mind says "Never." Please... Help me.

      The distance between us Is too frustrating to think of. The miles of misery That keep me apart from you. The meters driving me to madness That keeps me feeling this sadness. This sadness I feel Is so difficult to deal. The feeling is so real That I could not find the time to heal.  Please come back to me, Don't leave me be In this present state. Please don't make me wait... Forever causes me to become irate, I'm sorry for the impatience, But the distance between us is tearing me apart.

      CONCEALED MEMORIES OF SOMEONE ELSE, RESURFACING I must hide the torture, Hide the pain, Burning inside my heart. Though it really hurts, I must try and hide the pain.   I really gave my best to make you love me Yet you thought that it wasn't good enough. When will it ever be good enough? When will I be worthy to be good enough? Tell me...  Please...  Let me know. I gave my heart to you, What more do you desire? You became angry, I never thought you could be so selfish. Damn you...  Why did I even bother?  When I told you that, You laughed your evil laugh, You didn't care about me at all... You sadistic, overbearing bitch, I should never had wasted my time on you. Yet, in all my stupidity, I did, And now you laugh for my mistakes.  How could you do that with such pleasure? Such happiness felt in your heart Seeing a boy being tortured. It took me a long time to realize who you really are, It's pathetic, I know, but at least I finally knew, You're nothing but a demon in human form.

      Do you love me, You don't answer. You leave me be, In this state of confusion.  Do you love me, You turn your back. You ran to your house And began to pack.  Can you hear me? Why are you doing this? I cried out my plea... Don't leave me.  Yet, you left without saying goodbye, And didn't even pass me by To tell me that in your heart,  Our memories will soon die. Forgotten and withered away.  I would have done anything To make our memories ring, Yet in your heart, You refused. You wanted to forget, You never wanted us to have met.  Yet we did...  Now I'm all alone.  without you with me, I am drifting in sea of memory. Forever drifting.

      I'm always here... Please remember that. I'm always here... To be your friend. I'm always here... For you.  I may not be able to protect you from your demons, I may not be able to say the most beautiful things, I may not be able to agree with you all the time, I may not be able to help you everytime, But please remember... I'm here for you.  I may be the one that was mean to you, I may be the one that would insult you, I may be the one that hurt you, I may be the one that you hate, Please remember though, I didn't mean to.  I'm not the perfect person for you, I'm not your guardian angel, I'm not a very talented person, I'm not the smooth-talker, I'm not the cool person, All I am Is me.  I know that you are expecting someone who is as perfect As the person you are dreaming of, but I could never be like that.   I wish I was, then you would love me without a doubt. You would always believe everything that I'll say... You would always back me up through it all... You would always love me... You would always care... But all I am...   All I could ever be... Is me.    I'm sorry... I'm not your cool and perfect guardian angel, I'm not your smooth, good-looking, and charming friend, I'm not that person that you were imagining about But this is what I could promise for you, though, I will be your friend and I promise you, I will always be there for you When I am able to.  I will always promise to help you as best I can, Though it may not be the best help you ever received. I will always be there when you need a crying shoulder, Though sometimes my shoulder seems to not be with you. I will always support you with everything, Though we may argue sometimes. I will always be there, Though I might be busy sometimes. I am here for you, Though you may think that I am away... I was here all along.

      DAY OF SILENCE WRITING Silence,  The torture of not being able to hear one's voice. Even if it is your own, It hurts not being able to talk to the ones you love. The pain of not being able to respond, Only listen. The pain of not being able to express feelings and emotion, Just staying emotionless. The pain of being silent and emotionless, It's like feeling loneliness even though there are people around you. People that want to talk to you, People that want to share their feelings with you, People that would love to love you, Yet in this Day of Silence, You deny them of that desire they would love to share with you.

      Am I closer to becoming worthy in your eyes? Am I much better than what I once was? Am I much more beautiful than what I once was? Am I much more charming than my past self? You agreed.  Yet, when I look at myself at a mirror, I don't feel like I am a beautiful person, I feel like some sort of monster inside; I don't feel like I am charming, I feel like I am popular yet despised; I don't feel any better, I feel sick.  What could I do to make you love me  But let me still be my own self? What could I do to make you love me But let me feel beautiful in my own way? What could I do to make you love me But let me keep everyone dear to me?  All of a sudden, You turn your back at me and walk away. Anger and hate surround you, What have I done to make you feel that way? I never meant to hurt you, Nor did I do it to make you hate me. I just wanted to be myself.  Then I realized something I should have seen, Realized what you have been doing, Realized what you were planning. You wanted to change who I truly am. You hated who I really am.

      All around me, People with their own lives to live. People busy with something else. People doing something. People...  If only I could find someone who would have time for me, Someone who wouldn't ignore me, Someone who could listen to me, Someone who would talk to me, Someone...  Then I see something I have never seen, Something that looked like a deception, Do my eyes deceive me? No, my eyes were perfectly clear...  Someone stopped what they were doing, Someone came to me... They said, "Hello."  It was you... Thank you... For noticing me. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I keep asking myself,  Am I worthy enough for you? It's a question that forever plagues me, A question my subconscious always asks me. I don't know the answer. I never did.  I try to find out if I am worthy enough, If I am good enough to be your friend, Yet you still give me the same answer, "It's all right."

      I must finally move on, Move on with my life. I have been reminiscing, Always reminiscing About her.  She was the most beautiful girl These eyes have ever seen. She was the greatest girl I've ever met.  Damn, if only I took a chance. If only I was brave enough, To ask her, if she would, If she would go out with me.  Damn it! If only.  Now I have to move on, She is gone and I'm still here. If only I was the one that was gone, If only I was the one that left. I hated how fate drew us away. I hated how she never told me about this.  I must move on and forget about her. She left and I could never bring her back. All I could do is remember her And finally... Forget. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My writings are nothing compared to you, My skills are dwarfed by how great your writings are. Great... What an understatement. I could not fully express how powerful your writings are. Yet I try with my best efforts to express it. I could never be like you, But I ask myself, Why do I even try? Even with my persistence, I could never write as great as you. I could never be in the same caliber as you. Yet I still try... I must be the biggest fool in the world, Always trying, always reaching... For goals a fool could never reach. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ What's it like to be you? What's it like to be as great as you? I'm but a fool that is low in rank compared to you. I'm only a lowly rank among leaders and generals. I'm nothing compared to you. That's why I ask you, What's it like to be you?  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dear world, I now have nothing in this world worth living for. Nothing worth marvelling about, Nothing more amazing and wonderful As her.  She has left to another place, She and her family moved away. Leaving me alone here, Without even telling me that she did so.  I keep on thinking why she did that? Am I really as ugly as what people think I am? If that is so, why did she stand by me? Did I constantly annoy her about many things? If that is so, why did she continue listening? I don't know anymore...  I don't know what to do. She was my light, in this world of darkness, she guided me. She was my friend, who gave me love when no one else did. She was my muse, always inspiring me to become a better person. Now that she is gone, what else could I do in this world but live?  That's a laugh...  What do I have to live for? I live in my own world, where I mostly imagine myself away from the harsh realities. Away from the masses of people hasting to become mature adults, Away from the people's cruelty towards anyone around them. Away to my sanctuary, my haven, my refuge. Away to my fantasies. Away...   My friend, now that you are gone...  I don't know what to do anymore.

      Thank you, For your constant friendship means everything. I appreciate every bit of your thoughtful and kind character, For little things go a long way.  I am grateful, You have been with me even when I am disliked by masses. Why do you do this? I'm not worthy of your friendship yet you stay and listen. You always knew how to comfort me, Even among masses of people, you stand by me. Aren't you afraid that your reputation will be tarnished? A popular person standing by a nobody... Won't that phase you at all? Aren't you afraid of destroying everything that you worked for, For a selfish, ingrate fool?  Please open your eyes, Look at what you'll be risking. All you'll gain is nothing. All you have will become nothing. All you sacrificed for is nothing. All around you will be nothing. All you'll have is nothing. All you'll have is me...

      Trapped in memories... Trapped in sadness, Trapped in pain, Trapped in darkness. Trapped in everlasting cold.  Trapped by memories... Trapped by the fear of losing friendships. Trapped by the pain of losing her. Trapped by the constant reminiscing of her beauty.  Trapped by my memories of her... Trapped by my friendship with her. Trapped by my love for her. Trapped by my desires with her. Trapped by my imagination of her. Trapped...  Constantly trapped...  By her.

      Forgive me for my inconsideration, I didn't know that it offended you. Forgive me for my stupidity, though I try to change that. Forgive me for my faults, though I tried not to do that anymore.  Will you give me another chance to redeem myself to you? Will you give me another chance to be a friend to you? Will you give me another chance so that you could forgive me? Will you?  What I have done is wrong and idiotic, I am imperfect, that you could clearly see... Will you forgive and give me another chance to be the friend that you want me to be?

Without you, I don't have a muse.  Without you, I don't have anything worth living for.  Without you, I am dead.  My life is based around you. My life is everything when it comes to you. My life is worth fulfilling with you. My life is you.

Never say last, for you have impacted so many lives...  You have given me such a gift that I've become greedy...  I'm sorry.  I don't want you to stop what you do for you have been such a great friend and I would like to hear more from you.  Unfortunately, what I didn't want happened, you said last.

       FAMILY AND MYSELF   This world, this place where I was raised and given beliefs.  What the hell is it?  This is fucking pathetic...  Some people I know believe that they are perpetually perfect, they believe that I am an imperfect being.  Yes, I know I am...  I, at least, have the fucking decency to know what I am, not hide in an idiotic mask which makes people think that I am what I am not.  Morons.  Do you honestly believe you are great, I laugh at how cowardly you all to face your own truths.  What sad dumbfucks some of you are.  To think I honestly looked up to some of you...  I am disgusted at myself for believing, God damn it...  Why the hell did I believe it?  That was just sick.  I used to imagine that you guys were a perfect, well-bonded group, well, now is the time to face the facts, you aren't...  Hahahah!  My goodness, you treat other people to think that you are perfect but watch out, when they get a look at you behind the public eyes...  You aren't.  How sad that you aren't really what you are supposed to be...  Fuckers...

      It can’t rain all the time… Yet sometimes it feels that way. The depressing darkness, The falling rain, The cold winds… Like in movies where a great character dies… It is depressing to watch and accept. Yet, to some, not all rains are bad, To some, it’s calming and beautiful... Life blooming due to rain, Beauty will rise after this pain. So don’t let it make you insane. After all, it is only the rain, And it can’t rain all the time

      Time never stands still, It has its free will. Sometimes it turns ill, Should it take a pill? Time is neither generous nor selfish, It also doesn't take someone's wish. Gives and takes, That's what it usually makes. If only time went backwards during the time  she  had to depart... If only time forbade us to have part. Then again, we never really knew each other that well, Yet why do I feel that it was her that caused me to have fell? I don't know, Am I in love with her? Do I really love her? Is this just lust or passion? Or is it something else? I don't know... That's time for everyone,  Neither generous nor selfish... Time doesn't take wishes, Time just gives... Then it suddenly takes. How I wish that time never took this from me.

      The rain... Falling under the darkened earth... Soaking the unsuspecting people, Nurturing plants left ignored, Softening the ground to make it fertile. How I loved the rain... I used to think it was some form of redemption, Like my sins are removed and I am finally free from it. That the people I wronged have finally forgiven me. I don't know...  I'm a fool, A stupid little boy constantly imagining the impossible. A boy who loved to think he was a hero, A boy who is loved by everyone, hated by no one. These are just stupid little thoughts from a little boy...  Here is now how that young boy thinks: Will anyone ever forgive me for my stupidity? Will anyone ever pardon my foolishness? Will my sins ever wash away so I may be free? Will it ever rain for me?

      I don't know what you want me to say... I have no idea how to keep you at bay. I don't know anything about you... Who you are, who you like, what you look like... What makes you happy, what angers you... I don't know anything about you. I'd really like to meet you, See you...  Talk to you... Listen to you besides things you have to say here, in this place. I want to know what your type of music is, What games you play, what your interests are... I want to meet you, if you'd let me... Until then...  All I can say to you since I don't know you... Since I don't know what annoys you...  What angers you... What satisfies you...  What contents you... Are these few words that you'll constantly hear: I apologize...  I'm so sorry.

      Anger... This hate inside, Is too difficult to bury. This pain is running strong, Every judgement that I think is wrong. Every judgement is clouded, Shrouded... Shrouded in mystery. All thoughts contain only revenge, Revenge to those who were foolish. Feeling anger towards fools... Anger towards fools who look away and ignore me, Who wouldn't let me have a chance to make them see. Anger towards fools who think they are superior than me, When in the end we are all made of equality... Flaws may be different but they are still flaws. Perfections may not be the same but they are still of equal strength. If only these stupid fools would only see, What it is like when they hurt people like me. Then I wouldn't have to bear such malice... Such hatred towards them... Only then will I not have to bear such anger at all.

      Tired... Tired of waiting for your reply, Tired of sitting here as time flies by. What has happened here? In the past, we were able to talk regularly, We had numerous chances to meet physically... Talk to each other personally. What has happened here? What happened? How weird these feelings are, We have came so far, Yet our relationship became too sour. I don't know anymore, All I know is that I'm tired... Tired of waiting, Tired of sitting, Tired of writing. I'm sorry, It is time to say goodbye, Time to move on and fly. Time to catch up to my own time, I wish you the best, Though I wished that we could have overcame this test, This distance that tore our friendship apart. I guess I failed you, I deeply apologize to you. It had been such a wonderful moment, Now it is time to let it go, For I have become tired... So very tired... Of waiting, Always waiting. I have become so very tired.

      Hate... No use fighting it, No use resisting it, No use denying it. It'll always be inside everyone's hearts. Even if we learn to tolerate, There will always be hate, It may not be about race, gender, or sexuality, But it will always have some sort of personality. This evil feeling inside, Will never abide To the will of the light... Constantly it'll hide, But later on, it'll prepare for it's ride. Corrupting thoughts, Sometimes twisting realities, Blinding our eyes once open... Tainting us with its damnation. We will always be tainted by it, Seldomly commanding us at what it sees fit. We may sometimes be able to fight it, Seldom we may be able to resist it, But there is always one thing certain... We could never deny it. We may want to lie about this shit, But the truth will preside... That you could never hide... The surface is where the truth will always preside, Finding its way out of the bide, To reveal what we could never put aside, That there will always be hate, No matter what anyone does, No matter what everyone will do, The walls we build... It could always penetrate through... Creating chaos, mass chaos... Inside our hearts, towards each other, We could never prevail, Our combined strength is of no avail, It will always find a way To taint... To constantly taint... Never will it faint, It will continue its eternal quest To swallow us in its darkness, To let us see what it has constantly tried to show, Its constant sorrow... Its eternal woe... Its damnation... Its hate.

      To the tormented soul... Move on. No use dwelling on what has happened. It won't change any differently, It is time to face the facts, It happened, unfortunate for you. It does feel sad that it happened but face it, Sometimes unimaginable things happen. Whether it was bad or good, It is bound to have happened. If you want to change it, change it... Don't continue on crying in your miserable corner, That is just too pathetic. Really idiotic. Though this might come off cold, You know it is time to face this truth... It is pathetic... Idiotic to be exact. The one that you fell in love with is gone, The one whom you truly cared for is gone. People closest to you are now gone, They have left you to move on. It is time for you to do the same one, Pack up your misery and move on. The one you love is gone... Truly gone. No use crying, no one will hear you. No use screaming, no one will comfort you. No use at all. Simply no use... All you have left is two words, Two simple words... Two words... Move on.

      Why? Why do I do this? Why do I keep on doing this? Why do I want to write? Why do I want to write here? Questions in my mind, Questions constantly running, Questions constantly running in my mind. I keep asking why? Yet my answers run dry. Then I realize something, Something dumb, Something idiotic, Something desperate. I want to be loved, I want to be noticed. I want to see if someone cared, To see if someone wants their opinion shared. I wanted to see if someone had an opinion of me. I really wanted to see. Now, I met you guys, Who took the time to have your opinions shared. Yet there is one opinion I still would love to know, If you don't mind letting it show... Do you love me? Do you notice me? Do you care for me? Do you?

      Addiction... Can't focus, can't study... Can't accomplish, Can't become ready. What is happening here? It was a lot better than this... Can't redirect the thoughts into another, Always focusing on this bother. What will happen now? These thoughts tearing the mind apart... Tearing the soul... My heart is breaking down, Breaking... The pain of it all... Only knowing now that breaking this habit is hard, The soul has become a retard. The mind has become a shard... A shard of its former glory. No longer functioning to it's prime capacity, No longer accomplishing what it could normally do. No more friends to stay by your side, No one to confide... No one... Except yourself. The pain... The torment... The torture... Losing one's head... One's mind... One's heart... One's soul... One's loved ones... One's everything. Everything is lost, only nothingness stays.
