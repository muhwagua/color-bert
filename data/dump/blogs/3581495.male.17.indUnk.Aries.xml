      Don't you find it really shitty that time only flies when you're having fun. This, meaning that the majority of your life is spent not having fun, since time feels longer when you're not having fun. Would it not make more sense if time went slower when you're having fun so that you can enjoy it a little bit more? When you're not having fun and time is flying by, then who really gives a damn if not much fun is being had by one or more, or maybe all party members. Time is flying by so not to much of it is wasted doing things that are not really all that fun. Think about it.  How long do trees live? From a human being's point of view, the tree seems to live forever because it will survive far beyond my lifetime. So, trees live a really long time to us, but do they ever die. Since trees don't have any organs, then there is nothing to limit its proper function. By this I mean that animals are limited in age because our organs grow old. When the organs become old they don't work as well, so we eventually die. But the tree doesn't have this. Can we assume that it can live forever? If the tree is left undisturbed for a really long time, such as the pine tree in Tasmania that people thought was many trees because it covered 2.5 hectares but was in fact one huge tree which is dated at 10,500. Even though this is a hypothetical age because they probably cant find the main trunk to do a core dating thing where they count the rings. Core dating from some of the limbs show 4000 years which is not the oldest age for a tree but Is still pretty damn old. It is the oldest living organism on Earth. I guess this means that the tree left undisturbed will never die. Think about that next time you look at some trees.   I really hate people who go around town in their cars, by themselves, playing really bad music really loud. I can't stand it and it makes me mad. I was walking down the street today and at an intersection there is a dumbass in his crappy car, singing to the gayest song I have ever heard in my life. Naturally he was wearing a baseball cap turned backwards, a t-shirt which had the sleeves cut off, and a pair of sunglasses. I can't forget to mention that he had his arm out of the open window. I bet he thought he was the shit. I think he looked stupid but I guess I obviously can not represent the opinions of the population since I am one person.

      If the watermelon is pricked with a needle, does it not cry? The watermelon has feelings sometimes too easy to crush. When its confidence is reduced to muffin crumbs underneath a table in a cheap diner, it will weep. These Tears formidable to the eyes of most, due to the melon's 92% water content. If this watermelon were of gigantic proportions, it might even cry out lakes with their own little network of veins and capillaries. These lakes would eventually become the home for millions of living things. The birds would eat the bugs; the bugs would eat the poo from the butt of the Elk. The Elk, which is often shat on by the birds, eats berries from the bush. The bush gets its water a few feet bellow the ground which most probably came from the lake. In the lake there are fish. The fish, who also eat bugs, are in fierce competition with the birds. Some birds, such as the eagles, really don't care about the bugs and go strait from the fish. I've never seen a fish eat a bird. I bet sharks could do it.   Being a shark, I would lure the bird with the tip top of my tail. The tail looking like the end of a grey worm sticking out of the water would only attract the dumb birds like seagulls. The eagle, who isn't as stupid as his shit eating, shitting cousin, would not be lured due to its awesome vision and ability to see past the surface. The dumb shitting seagull would not be able to resist the plump grey worm. That juicy worm would be its last for little does it know that the worm is actually a great white looking for a dumb and easy meal. With a flick of its powerful scaly body and a single debilitatingly crushing bite with its hundreds of jagged shark teeth, the seagull is consumed. The poor dumb thing died so fast. So quickly in fact, it is simple to think that it may not have felt anything.   Does the fact that you die very quickly make any difference to the amount of pain you feel. A powerful question, it lingers in my mind. It seems like time takes a slightly slower pace when one is in peril. Maybe a hormone or something in our brain makes it record data a few times faster in order to create this illusion. The reason, of course, would be for the one in peril to have more time to think of how to get out of it. Getting back to pain, if collection of data occurs faster when the individual is in danger, then the quick death actually feels a lot longer then it truly is. Therefore I can make the conclusion that, assuming my theory is correct, dieing quickly does not really save you from that much pain. If you had a pain fetish, you'd probably like it. And you are very weird!  Some people say that life is a circle. That, what goes around comes around. Others believe in the circle of life, that everything is interdependent. Others really like the shape of the circle. Some like it for its lack of vertices, others from its single side. Some people would associate the color blue to the shape of the circle. Maybe there is a government agency that takes pride in making sure that most circles available to human kind are blue. Blue is a good color. Some of the people who would look at this blog would hold blue as a favourite, but mine is green. Green is like nature so it's everywhere.   Live in a box or a circle, how about a sphere. Who gives a damn anyways. The watermelon cries on. Existence drowning.   Update -> V 1.041  My friend has informed me that sharks actually do eat birds. It must be true since he saw it on the discovery channel. Sharks are really awsome.

      So I spent the weekend at the lake. My grandparents live next to a lake. Ever since I was a kid, visiting the lake and having a fun time has always been a top priority. It used to be so fun. Every one was there and my cousins and I would play baseball in the field. As we all got older, we all went alot less often down to the lake to have a good time. It was rare in the last few years that we would all be there at the same time. But this weekend a couple of us were there and it was fun to see each other again.   So basically most of my four days were spent by myself. Wooptidoo, you might say to yourself as you read this. But, four days spent at the lake is not a bad way to relax. The primary activities that took part in during my short vacation were that of sitting around in the sun reading a book and listening to music, taking pictures of stuff like little ducks, skipping stones, and windsurfing (which wasn't great because it was a little bit cold some days and the wind really sucked).   I actually spent about one hour one evening skipping stones. Many years spent visiting the lake has made me a pretty damn good stone skipper. Stone skipping is something that i consider as an art. The first step to a successful skip is choosing the rock. You have to pick out a rock that is not to heavy, not to light, not to flat, and not to bumpy. Otherwise, your skips will completly suck. Another key factor in the choice of rock is: if you hold it with your thumb and forfinger, does it lean off to one side or is it balanced. The balance of the stone will play a key role in the smoothness of your throw.   The next step is the throw. Some think that throwing the stone is a simple task. I think not. You hook your forefinger around the edge of the stone and hold it lightly in place with your thumb. Once that is done, you should lean forward alot so that your stone will hit the surface as flat as possible, maybe leaning upwards a bit so that on contact it will lift. You wind up, send your arm on a horizontal tradjectory, flick the stone off your forefinger. The stone is now headed for the water.   This might be the most important step of all! Pay attention here! As the stone goes through its skip, or if you did it right, skips, you should wear a face full of a mixture of surprise, and concerned. As you should be surprised that the skipping is really freaking awsome, but you are a little bit concererned, like if the through didnt go very well. Once this step completed, anyone watching the activity will think that even if your skip was totaly sweet, you know you can do better. To the eye of any observer you are a really awsome stone skipper even though you might not be.   Well thats it for my post about my weekend at the lake. I hope you have a lake to go to. Everyone should have a lake where they can hang out, think, maditate, draw with crayons, skip stones, hang out with ducks, play frisbee with a dog, go on a boat ride, or whatever you would like to do if you went down to a lake. And anyone who usualy doesnt go to the lake should because now you know how to skip stones. Skipping stones is a great reason to visit a lake. skip away my friends.   Oh and BTW, i saw the Neverending Story again on TV and i hadnt seen it in a while. It was totaly awsome.

      So the other day as I was walking around my backyard, when my foot came down on something odd yet delightful. It felt odd to my foot, but so soft. Why was I walking barefoot you might ask? Well, I felt like it. If you happen to find walking around barefoot weird, then maybe you're the weird one. Think about it.   A quick glance at the ground revealed, to my astonishment, that I was now standing on a carpet of moss that I had never noticed before in my yard. It is truly amazing to stand on. It was like any household carpet, except that it was approximately five hundred times softer. Then I took a picture and that was the end of it.    Something I tend to notice is the way some people walk very differently when other people are looking at them then when they think they are completely unobserved. It seems that an individual seems very stiff walking among a lot of people. An example of this that I can give you, is that of a guy I see walking around with a really big mullet. But before I talk about this, maybe I should tell everyone how awesome I think mullets are. What I like about mullets is not the fact that they are one of the ugliest hairstyles available (especially on women), but the fact that the person under the hair actually has the guts to have their hair like that. I find that awesome, and if I had the guts to do it, I would be the owner of a proud mullet. Oh and by the way, another interesting thing about the mullet is it's ability to sway in the smallest of winds.   Getting back to the guy with the mullet, he seems to walk very stiff walking in front of people. The problem here is that he is very elusive and I have never seen him walk when people are not watching; therefore there is no way to prove my theory.   What worries me about the stiff walk is that there is a possibility that when I walk, I also move very stiffly. There is no way of ever finding out, because even If I walk in front of a mirror, or film myself walking, I wouldn't be walking under natural conditions. The results of this type of experiment would not be good ones because of this fact.   Do you ever beat box to yourself when no one is around? I sure do. Because its fun. Has it ever happened to you that you were beat boxing and someone caught you in the act? It has happened to me. I felt really dumb.

      It really makes my day when there is a slight wind and there is a miniature blizzard of puffy little things. I guess they might be pollen. Or maybe its cotton from cotton plants somewhere. Whatever their origins, it is truly amazing to see millions of them floating through your field of vision. Maybe I like this so much because I really like winter, but I also like when the grass is green and there are leaves in the trees. With the pollen floating everywhere, it sort of looks like snow, but in summer.   You might not have noticed this about squirrels, but when they hop around, they kind of glide their tail around behind them so that it follows through the movement. It's really very hard to explain. Think of when you put your hand out of a car window and you make it go up and down like a sinusoidal function. It also resembles the effect of the wave being done at a stadium. If you still don't get what I'm trying to say then forget this whole thing for now and remember it when you get a chance to observe some squirrel while he gleefully skips across your lawn looking for some nuts to bury.   When you go to the beach and one of your friends or family members asks you to put some sun screen on their backs, it is always fun to try and write a dirty word with your finger without them noticing. After an hour or so of sunbathing, thinking that their skin is perfectly safe from harmful UV rays, WHAM! The word vagina is tattooed on their back for at least three weeks! Think about it.   I have always hated getting haircuts. Its not really that I don't like have my hair shorter again, its just that the time spent on that chair trying not to get caught looking at the hair stylist's breasts, could be used doing something else. Note: the majority of stylists are not young and incredibly hot. Another reason I don't like getting my hair cut, is that for a week or two I always look incredibly stupid. The hair looks great the day I get it cut, but then it looks like crap for a week or so. I really hate it when they are washing my hair, because the neck rest built into the sink, intended for comfort, is in fact very painful for me for reasons unknown.&nbsp;-> Possible conspiracy? Maybe.   To those of you who like purple flowers:

       urlLink     Sometimes I really like to just lie down on my back on a patch of grass and spend a while looking at the clouds go by. Some people might find this weird about me but its actually very relaxing. It allows me to simply think about nothing. Its not as fun when the grass is wet though, that isn't good. I also like it best when the clouds are really puffy and there are different tones of dark blue, violet, and pink. Those clouds make me feel happy. This picture was sent to me by my friend Laura out in Halifax. Hope you like it.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Birds are great. I really like when they hover a little bit when they are looking for some food. Everytime I see a really nice one like a Blue Jay, it always feels like a special occasion, like it is rare to see a Blue Jay even if its not that rare. Here is a picture of my freind Ludo doing some birdwatching. Enjoy.&nbsp; urlLink

      It comes to my attention that there is no purpose for the collection of rocks as a kid. It's every little boy's dream to own a box full of exotic looking gem type stones. This is great because you can then show them off to all your friends just to let them know that you have been to more places then they have. What the little boy doesn't know is that his enthusiasm for rock collection will take him to such exotic places as underneath the bench at the park, and that patch of dirt next to the parking lot at Zeller's. What I am trying to say is that, unless his father is a geologist or some sort of expert in the field of finding great rocks, his box will be filled with various different sizes of dull grey rocks with little metal squares which he thinks is gold only to find out that it isn't.   I think it is safe to state that at one point in time every little boy has collected at least ten rocks. I find it sad to say that at least 10 percent of them still have the box in a closet somewhere.   How many of whomever is reading this blog actually like my hat? Honestly though, I think this is the best hat ever made. It closely resembles the hat worn by none other then Harrison Ford in the tremendously amazing Indiana Jones series. If you are not familiar with the Indiana Jones series for some very odd reason, Harrison Ford plays the part of a totally kick ass archaeologist, and he goes through a series of equally awesome adventures in which he not only kicks the crap out of the bad guys, but avoids the booby traps and steals the booty. Booty as in the treasure, not the other kind! Unless you would rather see Harrison Ford grab some booty for an hour and a half, then you might just be weird. Unless you like that, of course. I'm not here to judge anyone.   Do you happen to find it funny when you see funny looking people hanging out behind something closed, like a screen door, or a window? Just today, I say a fat guy with no shirt on standing behind a screen door. There is no way to explain the way that I felt at that moment. The thought of it is hilarious though. One time, me and my friend Adam were walking a bit, and as we walked in front of a store, we noticed a woman standing behind a closed door. It was night at the time and the store must have been locked up. The funny part is she kind of looked a little bit sad like she was locked in. True story, folks. Oh, did we have a nice long laugh that time.   OH! And by the way, future plans for this blog include amazing photographs taken by myself, of myself or my friend Adam, in a completely new and random place every time. It might sound stupid now, but trust me; it will rock your world. Oh and I will also be taking pictures of anything really random I see for while and post them on the blog for all to enjoy. All this and more coming up during the next couple of weeks.

      Current mood : Gregarious. (i am also feeling great) + (stoked about first post)  What is it that makes you visit a blog? What is it that makes you want to see what i have to say? You don't know me. You may have heard my name said out loud, but whoever said it wasn't talking about me. "Chucky" also known as Charles. Charles who you might ask. The only Chuck worthy of holding the four corners in his nick name. Thats right, you've never seen anything like this before. There are strong chances that you never will again. Unless you continue veiwing this blog on a regular basis. This is something you might choose to do. I encourage you to do so. I encourage this because what you will find in further posts on this blog may blow you away. Warning!  If you could travel at any speed you choose, which speed would you most like to go at? My average walking speed is something like 3 kilometers per hour. It might not be exactly that since i have never checked, but I make the assumption that i walk that fast ( or slow if you happen to walk faster than that. You would know if you checked. ). The speed at which i would like to travel is not a random speed. It is a well thought out speed that i think would adequately fit my lifestyle. The speed i have chosen is 1.4 and one hundreth Kilometers per hour. Why this speed you might ask? Allow me to explain. I do not consider myself very cool. This might be because of the awkward speed that i travel at on a daily basis. Even if the speed at which i walk is not an important factor in the level of coolness i exude, walking particularly slow appears to display to other members of the human race exactly how much you don't really care about stuff. FOR example : If someone is totaly having a shitfit at you and you are walking by very slowly (1.41 Km/h), the person is "burned" by the fact that you don't care if they are yelling at you. Other people watching this scene might be thinking : "Wow! That is one cool dawg! He totaly doesn't care that he/she is bitching at him! He is my idol." Being a role model is very cool. Walking slowly can help you achieve that. Think about it.  Thats all for the first posting of the Exploration of the four corners. If you feel like it, leave your favorite travel speed and the reason for it in the comments. I think that would be pretty great. Also, if you have any questions about some of the corners, let me know. If you have any questions about something that bothers you about life, ask away. I will make it a pleasure to address these questions in my next entries. If you have any questions about how to change the diapers on your grandparents, please don't ask me, i don't know much about really old people.

        PART - 2 - Narration continues.     “Obviously, you do not know this,  but you are  jogging on my turf.”   The voice came from a place deep inside of me. I had been jogging for quite some time. A bright sun on a beautiful summer day would fade to grey, and soon the glowing orb made way for the vast expanse of the night sky. I knew that millions of glimmering stars made their homes throughout this black canvas, but only a few were visible. One of the downsides of living near a big city was the light pollution. The combined shine of the city lights, strong enough to drown out the starlight and keep the sky a few shades lighter then normal.   I was not aware of the time. The battery in my Timex had given due to my excessive use of its indiglo capabilities. Sitting on a park bench, mid afternoon, catching my breath, the rectangular button on the facing would be a temptation to anyone. It seems like the bright green fluorescence is at the same time warm and inviting as well as cold and stale. Staring in amazement, pedestrians and park dwellers contemplate the grown man sitting lonely on a bench shining the indiglo of his watch on things that he finds on the floor.   A deserted road. A dotted yellow line framed by brick walls rising out of sight. The voice had hit the masonry hard. Bouncing back and forth over the bricks, the sound came to my ear broken with short intervals. Where had the echo come from if this voice came from inside of my being? Was I loosing it? Had a full day of jogging distanced me from what it means to be human? A few minutes of ponder and I had decided that I was only slightly nutty. It was nothing truly far from ordinary. Sure enough, marbles were falling like the sands of an hourglass trough a whole in my sack.   I followed the yellow line, avoiding the pavement and stepping only on the paint because I had decided that asphalt had become lava for a little while. The cracks between two segments of sidewalk were also lava sometimes. Or even the black tiles on a black and white chequered floor. I could see down the street but it was as if my field of vision stopped 5 meters in front of me. Was this because I did not care what lay ahead of my journey? I could see the end of the street where I would have to make the life altering choice of turning left, or turning right. I could see the end of the street but in my mind 5 meters ahead was what lay ahead. That doesn’t really make that much sense.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Do you think that I will disappear when I am ignored?” Ghostly echo audible in the darkness.   This time I stopped walking for a little bit. I turned around one hundred and eighty degrees to my right as to see where I had come. Frantically I swept my eyeballs up and down each side of the road looking for any sign of a follower. The road was empty, but I was starting to freak out. I wasn’t crazy enough at this point to make these voices happen in my head; they had to be coming from elsewhere. Aliens from Delaware? Chicken in a Tupperware? Pile of dog shit in your hair? Would you like a tube of Nair?   I was running slightly faster now. Aliens could jog pretty fast, but they weren’t as fast as a galloping giraffe. Apparently they are very fast animals despite their grand stature. I was getting paranoid. I wasn’t afraid of the dark, more of what might dwell inside of its shadowy figure. My father used to wait for me at night under the bed and jump out when I would walk toward it. He started doing it as a joke when I was about three. By the age of nine I would check under a bed before walking into the room, even in a stranger’s house. By the age of 31 I had become the twitchy loser that is narrating this story.   I tried to forget about the voice. It was impossible though, as my feet hit the ground, waves of sound rippled trough the air. After a few bounces, it would return to sender. It would often sound like a second pair of feet following close behind. I was loosing it hard. With a sharp pair of shoes, I could have bore a pretty deep hole with all the rightwards swivelling that I was taking part in at this time. There would always be no one there. It was freaky. It was like the twilight zone or at least like a little bit like a Goosebumps episodes with cheesy monsters that always seemed to eat worms. As if all monsters eat worms. Give me a break! Break me off a piece of that… sanity?   “You probably think that I might start getting sad. Your wrong, I don’t get sad very often.” The same little voice, only a few decibels loud manages to slowly tear at my soul.   I turn around. I look to the right, I look to the left. I look up at the metal balconies of apartment buildings, at the windows, at the night sky. I look down… A figure is hanging out in a patch of shadow. I walk backwards a little bit. The thing follows and is drawn into the light. All of a sudden, the fear in me is gone, like when you flush the toilet on a big hard log. The figure is soaked in street light.   A ball of afro hovers 75 centimetres off the ground. With an approximate radius of 3/4 of a foot, the hair has a little guy and not the other way around. The curly mass is composed of surprisingly thin hair. Reflection of the street lamp overhead is visible on his shiny scalp. I guess it must tan quite a bit since the hair offers little or no protection against the sun. I may even start calling it the glorious bronze dome of awesomeness, or GBDA for short. As my eyes slowly made their way down the tiny man, various objects caught my attention. The first thing I noticed was the eye patch he wore over his forehead. Could he possibly be a Cyclops with fake eyes painted on?… Nice! The facial features were stout, somewhat stumpy. A strong little plump nose sat in the middle of the orb that was his head. A few metal plated teeth glinting in the light lit up his unusual little smile.   His face was a thing of wonder, but the real fun was with the clothing. A red knitted pull covered the at least 3/5 of his body. I was wearing some jogging shorts and a T-shirt made for jogging. It was about 23 degrees Celsius, I was sweating like mad. The little man had a wool turtle neck on to jog in the middle of august. Around his waist, slightly to the side was a pink fanny pack with the words “In jog we trust” stitched In white across the front with pictures of Duran Duran on the sides. Around his neck on a little rope was one of those old change holders that sort of looked like hollow pens. Did I mention it was blight green and phosphorescent? His pants were of very tight fitting corduroy. They ended about 5 inches from his ankles. He had nice shoes. His shoes made my jogging shoes look like amateur wear. He meant business, and I wasn’t going to let him see how little I knew about the sport.   “Have you been following me long?” I asked in the calmest voice I could dig up.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Don’t act like you didn’t know. You turned around like five times and you looked straight over my head! Except for that time I had to stop to take a dump and you thought you heard something but you really didn't.” The little man seemed pissed off at the world a little bit. Maybe he was just pissed at me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How is this ‘your turf’?” Calmly once again, trying to keep my composure.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Everybody knows it’s my jogging turf, and you’re on it.” His little scratchy voice was rising slightly with every phrase.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What do you want from me?” I tried to use a menacing voice as an attempt to intimidate the little guy with my strong voice. Truth being that my voice was not very strong sounding and the look in his eye told me that he wasn’t going to take any shit, especially from me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ll let you through, only if you can pass ‘the challenge’. Not many people can pass my challenge and I'm very proud of that fact cus it totally kicks ass!”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What’s the challenge?” I was getting excited.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whou, you'll find out when your ready."  He makes a whoo noise when he laughs... who does that?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring it, little man, im ready for your tiny little challenge!"  Whatever this challenge was going to be, I would kick his little butt at it. My journey was just beginning and I wasn’t about to turn back thanks to some little Cyclops with a nice GBDA and a large see-through afro. I wasn’t going to be beaten by a dude with a pink fanny pack and a stupid change pen thing from the eighties.&nbsp;

      The street was busy with the steady traffic of commuters on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. People of all sorts and ages were walking up and down the sidewalk. Destinations: unknown but to themselves, and maybe to some of their friends or family. Perhaps a neighbour which they secretly hate might know where they are going. Maybe someone eavesdropping on a conversation may know where this walking stranger is going. Wherever this walk ends may be an important place, but some walk for the purpose of making others think that they are going somewhere relevant when they really aren’t. Maybe these people walking for no purpose just felt like being one of the people that everyone who doesn’t have anywhere to go notice walking on the street and envy.   Walkers were slowly bobbing in and out of shadows created by rows of trees on either side of the street. Some of the walkers were bobbing faster because not everyone walks at the same speed. The trees were showing off magnificent foliage of green. Occasionally, there could be seen a tree with thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of little flowers. Of course, this tree would be the most popular, visited by all the little cheerful chirping birds. It was also popular to the insects. Though concealed by the leaves, a loud buzzing might be heard if one were to walk along side of it. Enjoying the magnificent day was not an activity that only the birds would indulge; people were having lunch in the sun, on the balconies of their apartments. In the alleys, occasionally kids would be seen playing. Their mothers, dressed in flowered gowns and usually wearing some sort of bonnet, skilfully hooked the family’s clothing on the line to dry while keeping a close eye on each of their brats. All of this was happening while cars sped up and down the street.   I could describe the city street for ever because of all the things going on at once. But none of what was going on really concerned me at this point. The light, fixed onto a green pole, which was probably made of steel or some sort of iron alloy, was red. Shiny, aggressive red that gets you frustrated. I guess that is why the red light is the stop light and not the go. Countless cars were swishing by. I stood on the corner jogging without direction, without energy of the kinetic nature as a result of forward movement though I was still wasting a couple Joules by jogging in place. People would notice, finding it weird they would question me.   “Oh, I’m just trying to keep up a rhythm” I would answer in an unenthused voice, followed by one of those little smiles that you do when you don’t really care about the person your talking to but are just trying to be polite.   The clouds that day were like those in all the movies set in Europe with the beautiful skies that make you wonder if they do it on purpose or not to only film on days with nice clouds. There can’t always be nice clouds everyday, that’s impossible. There must be some place though, where there are more nice cloud days then ugly cloud days. But in the city, nice cloud days are somewhat rare, unless the smog is making nice patterns through the skyscrapers or something.   This day was one of those nice cloud days but I wasn’t here to look at the scenery and cry, I was here to jog. When the light turned green and the little glowing symbol of a guy walking lit up, jog is what I did. I jogged with all the might in my body.   My shoes were made for jogging. That’s what the guy selling the shoes at the store told me. This simple fact seemed to make me jog twice or maybe three times better then I normally would. It might seem stupid but a great pair of jogging shoes makes a huge difference when it comes to real jogging. I’m not talking about fake sissy jogging for sissies, I’m talking about the real stuff that real men do when they know they have to stay in decent shape… for the ladies mostly but also for one’s personal mental stability and health. This fact about the properties of jogging shoes when it comes to jogging, of course, came right out of a pimply face belonging to an honourable high school graduate who measured the size of my foot with that metal ruler they always make you put your foot in at the store. No doubt in my mind, in the future, walking into the store will automatically give the clerk that kind of pertinent information. The size of your feet, width and length, the length of each of your toes, if you have a weak foot or athlete’s perhaps, and whether you are flat footed or not. This data would all be transmitted from an implant inside of your foot or calf muscle or some place interesting like that.   My track suit, blue. Not the dinky blue for babies that you see little girls wearing. No, it was a manly blue. The kind of blue you would have your manly pickup painted. Or maybe the kind of blue you would have on a baseball bat or football jersey. It was manly alright, and it didn’t really matter that I didn’t even like pickups, blunt wooden objects, or competitive sports all that much.   Why the obsession with manliness one might ask as they read on? It all started when I emerged from the womb as an only child in a high middle class family where my father was always off playing golf or to busy to play sports with me, and my mother cared way to much about my well being and bought all my clothing up until the tender age of 19. It can be assumed that these living conditions, along with being picked on in school, made me the weak, oversensitive coward I am today. Am I going through a midlife crisis? One could ask this question, but I would have to answer it with no. I am still quite young. I am 31 years old, I don’t enjoy my job, and I get rejected by more women then anyone would care to count. At this time, it could seem to me that life was like a pitching machine from the batting cages, hurling lemons at me, 70 km/h through a tube. Brief analysis of my life revealed that not very much lemonade was being made with the tremendous quantity of ripe, yellow, football shaped fruit that are continuously mashed hard into my face.   I didn’t grow up on the street or in a bad neighbourhood, but my childhood was just as distressed. And now I jog.

      If you are actually reading this blog, and are reading some of the older posts, please ignore all the âç# crap. Slowly ill be going over those posts and switching the â@# back to apostrophes, dashes and / or exclamation points.   There are some pretty damn weird people. have you ever noticed those psychotic extroverts who really want to help out everyone but end up screwing up whatever the other is trying to accomplish? It's not that they did what they were doing to help wrong, but they are completely unaware of the order in which the steps to reaching the goal must occur. So, while trying to help out and save time, they actually delay the goal by taking the wrong step at the wrong time. In personal expreince the helper was completely blind to my frustration and was ranting about how they had helped out a bunch of people that day... Have I just stumbled on one of the most important causes for stress in society today? It is possible. I would really want to know exactly how many people she had 'helped out', and how many people went home pissed off at life.   Lately, I've been seeing a lot of punk kids, with some sort of plastic ball, being an asshole. Most of these kids have faded T-shirts with some WWF logo on it, possibly (most probabaly) hand-me-down, and a pair of jogging pants with a racing flag design across one knee. These kids walk around bouncing their stupid ball and giving you this mean, I don't take crap from anyone, look. But then, your thinking, this kid is almost half a meter tall and I could probably take him out with the slight left to right movement of my arm, surely he must know this. Yet, you still recieve the dirty look and the child continue's to obnoxiously bounce his dumb, lime green, cloud paterned plastic ball. These kids make me very mad. Every time that I see one, I get the overwhelming urge to totaly crack a glass bottle across the kids stupid, fat, obnoxious face.   After you get over the fact that the runt of a child is being a little shit, you catch a glimpse of his mother. For information on the shit's mother, please refer to number 4 on my list of weird people on the public bus in the post entitled The Monkey Roams V 1.06. &nbsp; Update - The crap is all fixed now. Yay? I'm happy, but does anyone care?

      If raccoons are most active at night, where do they hang out during the day? In urban areas, the raccoon is notorious for its night time garbage picking. Not only will it take things out of your garbage and eat it, but chances are that it will spread the crap around the better part of your driveway just for the fun of it. Some think the raccoon is cute. Its fur being very soft looking, people may try to make physical contact with the wild beast. Obviously they are not aware of the danger which this urban trash collector represents to the human population. Wielding terribly horrific front teeth of the rodent kind, and a pair of powerful paws equipped with long sharp claws, the urban raccoon is a formidable opponent for any broom stick. I've seen raccoons totally beat up a kid who was biking home a little bit too late. The bike went missing and a few days later, the cops found the mangled thing behind the convenience store along with broken beer bottles and empty cigarette packs. Raccoons should not be underestimated. They make people cry. They wreck apart families and ruin entire lives.   What puzzles me is that I never see them hanging around during the day. Where do they go when the sun comes up? Being a hooligan during the day is a lot harder then when the silent cover of night time darkness is available to them. They know this all to well. Where do they sleep during the daytime? It's not like they can make little burrows all over the place. I think people would notice a bunch of holes in their yards. The raccoon can get pretty big. I've seen one the size of a microwave oven. I never lie about these things. Huge raccoons make huge holes. With holes this big, it is impossible not to realize that raccoons are living in your backyard.   I've also never seen any miniature raccoon style log cabins around. They would look like regular log cabins, except that they would be miniature and be the home to a bunch of raccoons getting into all kinds of trouble and mischief. The teenage raccoons setting bags of shit on fire on the doorsteps around the neighbourhood. The lady raccoons getting busted by undercover raccoon police officers for raccoon prostitution on the streets. All kinds of wacky adventures!  Have you seen the commercial for the Ford minivan with electric folding third row seats? At the push of a button at the front of the vehicle, the third row seats flip in or out of the floor. This is probably the worst idea for a minivan ever. Grandma comes over for a visit. She sits in the third row of the van on her way back home. As she patiently awaits the departure, the coolest kid in the world or possibly a mischievous raccoon sneaks into the vehicle and pushes the button that activates the third row seat. In a few confusing seconds, poor old grandma is crushed into the floor by the electric third row seats. Hilarious to most, but not to old people around North America or maybe even the universe. By the way, raccoons carry diseases.

      The backyard is a place of weird and awesome happenings. Now that I think about it a little bit, I use the word awesome a lot! Getting back to this magical story, the backyard is a center for magical adventures in the wild. The wilderness of suburbia that is. A unchained paradise where the animals do what they freaking want to do and can even be a little bit mean about it. Where the squirrels are free to wave their tails around like Sin functions. Where my neighbour tries to conceal a tiny little pot plant amongst the raspberries thinking that my mother would not know the difference. That is the true essence of the backyard.   The story began when I was going for an afternoon swim. I get out of the pool and I notice something in the shade of a tree, under the fountain squirting watering device. A double take revealed that it was a little black bird. It was sitting really low with its beak at a 45 degree angle and looking so weird. I walked closer to see if it would fly away. The bird did not fly away. It seemed as if it was in some sort of fountain induced trance. Totally trippin' because of the mist of tiny droplets that swept across it's feathers. To ask the bird, "Hey, how's it hangin', how's it chillin', how's it... trippin'?", would have been inappropriate I believe. This, mostly due to the simple fact that I do not believe that birds can understand English. If you didn't quite get that, me, not thinking that birds can understand English is a fact, Because it is true that I do not believe birds can understand English.   At what point in evolution did the dinosaur become warm blooded? Why would it do that? Birds existed at the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, in which the world was perfect for the cold blooded dinosaur. Did some dinosaurs start living in trees? Little obnoxious carnivores climbing trees to be cool but going to high where it was to cold? The warm blooded, being much better adapted to the cold, would be well suited for COLD! This is why I think it is weird that the bird even existed in the Cretaceous.   If the bird had not evolved from the dinosaur at that point in time, would it exist today? Would there even be a bird hallucinating under my lawn watering fountain thing, the one shaped like a doughnut with all the little holes? Oh and by the way, it's yellow.   Public transportation is good. I tend to like being on the bus better then being at my destination. What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, tell us why you feel this way. You might ask that first question, and I will answer. I don't think anything is wrong with me. What I like about the public bus is the different people that come on it. People to a bus is like the visible color spectrum to the eye. Here's a quick rundown of the different people that can be seen taking a city bus where I live.  The list is in order of originality, awesomeness, and also rareness.   1-	The Mulleteer - This guy doesn't give a damn what you think. The only thing he cares about is how well his mullet sways in the wind. Usually wears tight, worn jeans torn at the knee and a worn out grey T-shirt with the word Basketball written on the front of it.  2-	The stare down man - This man will walk on, sit a few seats ahead of you, and stare you down. Usually middle aged wearing kaki shorts and is balding. He's a simple man. Though he isn't very rare, in Quebec, he is more rare then these next ones. 3-	Disgruntled lesbian haircut woman - Probably about 65 years of age, her hair has gone grey. She sports a strong lesbian haircut (very short but sort of long in the back; A short female version of the mullet) even though she just doesn't know it. She may know it but we can't know for sure if she is a real lesbian unless we talk to her. You should never talk to strangers on the bus, only observe them. Its more fun that way. 4-	Disgruntled Single mother who yells at kid non stop - She walks onto the bus with one or more little children who look like good kids. These kids are usually under the age of 4. She yells at the kids constantly even though they are not doing anything wrong and are just trying to have a little bit of fun. She is a single mother working hard to raise her kids. Credible excuse, if only she had any manners or class at all. She swears to much, especially in front of her child(ren). She wears clothing that her figure can not permit. It is not rare to see a very, very tight outfit, sometimes fluorescent blues and pinks in a floral pattern with large Thorax exposure. 5-	Chatty McFartyass - This guy has a German accent. He comes on the bus dressed all classy and ready for a boardroom conference. Five minutes into the bus ride, he can be seen frantically looking for reasons to start a conversation with the nearest person. Unless you are completely cold, there is no way of a getting out of it unless your sanity is salvaged by the arrival of your bus stop. This man is weird! I think I messed up the rareness on this one it should maybe go between the stare down man and the disgruntled 65 year old lesbian hair woman.   That's only a few of my favourites. I don't really have time to talk about the amazing B.O.BOY or the guy trying way to hard to look like he's into rap music. Sorry to those who wanted to read a little bit about them. Sorry to anyone who may get offended by this list. I have nothing against, Lesbians, Germans, single mothers, or people with mullets. I believe I've already written about how much I think mullets are awesome.

      Often, I find myself bored, sitting through horrible movies. Lately it is not rare that I see a movie that is pure garbage. Some of these horrible movies I have seen lately include, The Last Samurai, starring everyone's good friend Tom Cruise. Sure, I will admit that Samurais, Ninjas, and Japanese culture is pretty damn awesome! The problem with this movie is that if you turn the samurais into white people, it looks oddly familiar. It struck me as resembling those American war movies, packed with patriotic garbage. A prime example of this is of course, The Patriot (2000), starring everyone's other friend, Mel Gibson (Some may know him better as Gibby). That was one horrible movie, but I'm not going to talk about that one right now. The connections can be made between all of the garbage war movies that resemble The Patriot (excluding Saving Private Ryan and Enemy at the Gates which were both brilliant films). There is also the fact that the friend of the main character always takes so long to die. Like that one guy in The Last Samurai who hated Tom for being white at the beginning but then he became friends with him when Tom whooped him. He seriously took like two gun shots and a stabbing and he was still fighting. You can spot that in most of these shitty garbage movies.   Another movie that I thought was crap, was Eurotrip, starring a bunch of dorks and Harriet the spy, Michelle Trachtenberg. This is a horribly disappointing film from the producers of one pretty funny and one amazing movie. Pretty funny: Road trip (2000), and amazingly awesome: Old School (2003). Eurotrip was an arse load of bad jokes, terrible physical humor, and a whole lot of breasts. It was like watching horrible soft core pornography. Garbage.   Anyways, I'm not here to be a movie critic. If you liked these movies then I don't really care. One thing you can do while watching bad movies (sometimes you can do this during good movies to) is pay close attention to the movie extras. The utter lack of acting talent in the extras is where the real entertainment is in most bad movies. I am not saying that all movie extras are terrible. I actually believe that the majority are very good at doing their job. There is the occasional horrible one that makes a funny face when he/she really shouldn't be making one, or walks or looks really weird. For most movies these days, paying close attention to the extras is the only way to justify your five or ten dollar entry fee at the theatres or whatever your local video store charges.   Here are some movies that you should avoid if you don't like having excrement rubbed hard into your open eyeballs. First on my Movies to Avoid list is The Chronicles of Riddick. Who even likes Vin Diesel anyways, pure garbage. Second is King Arthur. All I can say to that is what the hellâ€¦ Third is White Chicks. Even though it may provide some entertainment in the form of crude jokes and/or physical humour, it is pure garbage. Fourth is Garfield the Movie. Cartoon to movie conversions are always disastrous. Don't be expecting too much from this one.   Sorry I put you through my stupid ranting about movies I hate and like. I just felt in the mood to talk about some movies. And I think it is a good idea to warn people about upcoming, hour and a half long, shit throwing festivals. Don't go see this movies unless you are intoxicated, and try the movie extra thing, its pretty funny. Here are some genius movies that I really enjoyed a lot in case you care. For those who don't, don't bother reading this part if you hated the entire thing so far.   Confidence (2003), starring Edward burns, Andy Garcia, and Dustin Hoffman, was an amazing movie. Runaway Jury (2004), starring Dustin Hoffman once again, Gene Hackman, and John Cusack, was also a really good film. The Bourne Identity (2002), starring Matt Damon, is a really good movie. If you haven't seen these already, you should. Oh and Le Papillion, a French film, was a very moving story if your into movies that make you feel really happy about life at the end.
