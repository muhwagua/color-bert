      i went and tried to put an aluminum sealant into my radiator to try to seal the crack in the engine block. but first, i had to drain the radiator. D'OH! it took me 4 hours to take the engine apart and try to unscrew the elusive cap. i finally took the radiator apart from its holding area, but i needed a third hand to lift it and my other two to accomodate the twisting motion. of course, i only have two hands, so it did not work. it could have been a thirty minute job if my "friend" Tim the Toolman Taylor would have gotten off of his ass and helped me instead of staring at me...

      ::The dream dies:: i'm really depressed right now and need to write this down to clear my head... if you think your life is bad, read on, and maybe it will cheer you up... well, on the way to fix the cracked radiator, the head gasket blew, but we did not know it. the mechanics repaired the radiator and informed us that we needed a new engine...after we dropped 400$ for the repair, of course. now it is sitting at a Pepboys parking lot across town in a really bad neighborhood. so, logic would denote that it is getting broken into right about...now. and while walking 5 miles to work, Trish got a ride from some stranger who decided to be a pervert and she had to jump out of the moving car. she did not receive any injuries, thank god. i figure that the price of a rebuilt engine will cost more than we paid for the car. actually we still owe about 1600 more $$$, so we might sell it for parts. that could be enough to cover a few months' car payments. public transportation to the rescue... it's going to be a pain taking the bus to buy groceries, cash paychecks, and get us both to work. fortunately, my school offers a discounted bus card at the supply store. it is good for one month at a time. well, i need to go do my homework and go to bed so i can get up and walk to school with my art supply kit and bookbag in 5 hours...

      one more confirmation that god hates me... we were on our way to send a car payment when our radiator crapped out on us. ARG! it is cracked and we have to replace it. so, it appears that this car payment will be late... oh well, this ought to cheer me up:  urlLink heehee ! thanks MK.

      i work as an interviewer and i poll people. this has reconfirmed that the general populace is a herd of idiots. here are actual quotes from morons i interviewed tonight.  this is a conversation with an older gentleman:  Q: what is your age? A: you want to know about my sex life?! Q: do you work, or have you ever worked, in the following professions? A: (interrupts) NO! Q: (continues) banking, market research, journalism.. A: we don't even OWN a computer!! Q: what brands of cell phones have you heard of? A: i'm not interested in what you're selling! (click)  sigh...this next guy could not seem to grasp the concept of the survey:  Q: do you know what a cell phone is?! A: i just moved here!  apparently, my introduction is confusing to other people, too. sometimes i get frustrated and go off the script:  Q: would you like to take a survey?! A: i don't know how.... A: i am the people not working here home now... A: sure, my motorola isn't working! i can't get service out here on suchandsuch road! why won't it work? i tried blah blah blah. one time i had to blah blah blah... A: i do not have any opinions...

      well, the august archives appear to be gone. i tried republishing them, but there was an error 230. it said document does not exist (!), but the pyra ppl say that error 230 is a syntax error (?).... oh well, there were only 7 posts in august. i suppose i will have to manually archive every month just in case.  i'm perturbed because the pyra crew never bothered to reply to my email....

      it's kind of annoying. i have noticed that the archives do not publish on somedays. i am investigating this occurance. if there are no archives, then that pretty much defeats the purpose of a weblog, now doesn't it? i hope this is not like talkcity all over again...

      the financial woes in our household have become pretty grim. but have no fear, for i have been drowning my sorrows in emulation therapy. i just got a new emulator called visualboyadvance. it runs old skool gameboy, color GB, and GB advance roms. the gb advance games are pretty glitchy, but the gb color and oldskool roms run great. gb advance is just another version of snes, anyway. i started playing harvest moon 2 and dragonquest: monsters, last night. also, i have an ongoing campaign in ogre battle. that's on the new and improved zsnesw1.35, of course. i recently started playing simant and simcity again. and one of these days i need to finish secret of mana, chrono trigger, and seiken densetsu 3( secret of mana 2). those jap translations(.ips) are great. with it i have discovered wonderful jap rpgs, such as romancing saga 3. there is no purpose to that game. just gain characters and abilities and wander the countryside fighting monsters, plundering treasures, and leading armies against your enemies. it's never the same game twice. you can go anywhere, whenever you feel like it. back on  the jnes front, i am busy attaining avatarhood in ultima, and repairing the damage to the space time continuum with bill and ted. if i get bored, i go for a rousing game of dodgeball. and nothing brings back memories like toejam and earl on genecyst... if you have no idea what i've been talking about, but seem interested in finding out where to acquire these magickal emulators and roms, just contact me...

      oh yeah, i just wanted to mention what these fools at work kept saying to me the other day.  my statement was: " i am conducting a survey about cell phones, and would like to include your opinions.." what stupid people seem to hear is: " do you own a cell phone?" their reply is always: " i do not own a cell phone" so naturally, my reply would be: " ok thanks, just checking to see if you have a cell phone. take it easy."

      allright, what's happening, everybody? so, i'm back in skool for the fall quarter. this quarter is going to be grueling because of the simple fact that i'm taking geometry. it's been like 6 years since i attended a math class or even used higher math.  my instructor is this 24-25 year old jew, straight outta krakow (his accent is so thick). he is brilliant mathematically. it is cool to watch him teach a subject he is passionate about. sadly, he turned 2 of the 4 hour classtime into an algebraic exercise nightmare. i actually had a headache after leaving that class. oh well. i am finally getting exposed to animation related courses. today, i sat around with 20 other students and the instructor, for 2 hours openly discussing (BSing) the subject of animation. then, we watched cartoons! is this the greatest life or what? hmmm.. what else happened today? oh yeah, UPS gave the students at my skool a pizza party-raffle-job application-DJ-survey-extravaganza.(?) basically, there were dvd players and stuff, being raffled off based on ticket numbers whose ticket was originally rewarded  by completing a 5 question survey. after completing the survey and receiving a ticket, there was an abundance of junk food to be enjoyed. meanwhile, a dj was bumping out the latest ATL hitz out of a stack of 15s. that's right, the united parcel service. i had a good (exhaustive) day at the 'tute. later that night, at work, i conducted several surveys about telephone directories to residents in and around the area of elizabethtown, ky! mainly munfordville and glasgow, though. everyone i spoke to appeared to be a grumpy old farmer...

      we use a random dialing machine at work, and sometimes we get businesses on accident. once, i got moviefone. tonight i called a business, and the girl answered the phone:"thanx for calling uncle vito's pizza, home of the chicago style pizza, can i help you?" i just had to.... so, i tell her i would like a carryout order. she asks me what my phone number is, and her number is on my screen. it was some number in minnesota. i repeated her own number back to her and changed the last four digits. then, i proceed to tell her that i would like 2 medium pizzas. one with pepperoni and no cheese, and the other pineapple with no sauce. sounds pretty nasty huh? i know there are some freaks out there who like crap like that.  just to make it more interesting, i add on some jalepenos and anchovies on halves and thirds of each. she told me it would be about 14 bucks and would be ready in 20 minutes... ain't i a stinker?

      ok, so this dick downstairs keeps filing noise complaints against me. if i get one more we will have to relocate to another apartment. the thing is, we are never home long enough to make any noise, what with work, skool, and sleep. he's such a whiny bastard. after the first complaint, i went downstairs and talked with him. i told him if there was ever another problem to just come knock on my door and let me know...you know, kind of what adults do. guess what. he never spoke with me again, and filed two more. what a pud. i hate him.   i talked to the housing office chick concerning this issue and she said that she had no power to intervene. basically, if someone makes a complaint, nobody from the apt. complex comes and checks it out and no cops come to investigate. they just file it away and i look like a bad guy. well, if all it takes is someone picking up  the phone and bitching, then two can play at that game...

      ::readbetweenthelines:: as i write this, bush is in the background giving a pep ally. it is vaguely annoying. i am hooked on all the news coverage. unfortunately, to get the whole story, i am forced to watch telemundo for hours on end. too bad i don't speak a word of spanish. how can the us regime get all bent out of shape over the iraqi broadcasts of our pows. it's not like we did not broadcast images of their troops surrendering. now,  that  is humiliating. getting photgraphed surrendering. and cnn broadcast pix of the bodies of dead pilots being dragged through the streets of somalia, plus pix of a pow. what's the difference? iraqis don't understand that americans might not torture them, just as we do not know the intentions of the captors of our pows. i find it interesting the way iraq is exploiting the media to their advantage. looks like the great satan can still teach them a  trick or two.

      gah! all the misinformation is making me dizzy. i bet that staged-looking pilot search on the banks of the tigris river, downtown baghdad, was really a bunch of SEALs that got caught. i find it irritating the way american media focuses on any lead and broadcasts it immediately, without checking for accuracy. first, we were told that the 7th cav was halfway to baghdad, and um qasr was captured. then, it starts unravelling and they admit that we had not captured it, and the troops were still in the southern corner of iraq. the iraqis are effectively exploiting the "coalition" force's weaknesses; i.e. not shooting at civilians, being too trusting about surrenders, and putting the infantry in front to clear the way for the armor. on that last one, isn't it supposed to be the other way around? on second thought, i guess it  is  safer for the tanks to not get blindsided in an alleyway, and make the ground troops clean out every single building of bad guys without injuring or killing civilians.  btw, is the word "coalition" a codeword for "british forces in front"? i've heard through my reliable sources at cnn(a time warner/aol/turner/microsoft/time/life/viacom company) that there is a ringed moat of fiery oil surrounding baghdad. that sounds horrific. i can only imagine that scene, approaching the metroplis sector. i'm done rambling for the night...

      i am against this war, because north korea is the bigger threat and afghanistan is not finished, yet. however, i think the live video footage of the 7th cav is awesome. does that make me a hypocrite?  is it just me, or do other ppl want to see some kind of climactic gunbattle break out during one of those live videophone sessions? on the home front, shouts out to amber and chad for the excellent party on friday. that's all for now. don't forget to barricade your windows with duct tape so no oxygen gets in and you suffocate...

      i just want to thank limewire for fucking up my computer beyond belief! all that shitty spyware they do not tell you about which i cannot uninstall and keeps causing my legitimate programs to crash at startup! all these new programs are constantly screaming for internet access and using up valuable memory resources. i uninstalled them, but they are still there in the program files folder and msconfuckingfig, and they do not show up in the add/remove programs list gawdammmit! i tried to download that mcafee uninstaller demo, got 99% of it, then the motherfucker froze!! son of a bitch! so, i go back to the download page (where mcafee has reassured me that if a download is interrupted, just click there and it will resume), and the pages just keep going in circles. after visiting the same 4 screens about 60 times, i gave up. right now, i am torn between swallowing my pride and simply turning off limeshop.exe at startup and hunting down "wjview.exe", better known as "Microsoft VM Command Line Interpreter" and destroying it, plus deleting any program folders that get in my way ::OR:: backing up all my files on cd, reformatting this POS, and spending the next 2 weeks downloading patches, upgrades, and drivers... i am broke and have not smoked a cigarette in 2 days, so i will probably pick option # 3: chuck the whole machine off an overpass at moving vehicles...

      i upgraded to a newer version of nutscrape navigator today and noticed the strangest decree in the fine print. it reads as follows: " Netscape Browser software contains encryption technology that is subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and other U.S. law, and may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries (currently Afghanistan (Taliban-controlled areas), Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria)" so, this means that america is safe so long as our enemies do not get their hands on version 7.02 and are confined to the inferiority of version 7.0?  now, my browser automatically detected the upgrade. what's going on with iraqi software? do their sysadmins abide by some international moral code that prohibits them from granting permission to users to enable the auto-update feature? what about civilians? who prevents them from auto-updating? these are serious dilemmas. more importantly, is it really a good idea to install our most advanced encryption technology into a program which  is accessible TO EVERY PERSON ON EARTH?!

      have you ever closed your eyes and listened (?) to the thought patterns inside your brain? it seems like first, there is a voice saying a sentence or name of an object or whatever. next, nanoseconds later, you echo the phrase and identify the subject matter, forming a cognitive thought. after that, if you are talking, you say it out loud. that is the third step. sometimes ppl skip the second step and blurt out whatever it is. other times, ppl seem to get caught up in the second step and dwell on its meaning, without ever going to the final step...

      saw the matrix reloaded in the same theater i saw the first one in. it was everything i hoped it would be. the plot was deep. thanks wachowski bros! the only gripe i have is that some of the fight scenes went on for too long or seemed like they had sfx for sfx sake. i thought it was great.  anyone who says they did not like it, i have no respect for, and are probably plugged into the matrix unknowingly... i also managed to see bruce almighty. it 's subject matter hit close to home. (to god: you SUCK!) the film was good. go see it.

      i was posting a message for my online class about dreams, and it got me thinking about some other stuff. when i dream, i live out another person's entire day (for the most part, no matter how surreal it is). when it is over, i go to sleep. then, i wake up in my "real" life. sometimes i feel exhausted from being involved in another lifestyle. (am i crazy, yet?) i'll explain it in more detail.  i'm sure everyone has had that sensation when they are waking up; you get excited to drive your new car, or spend all your million$ of dollar$. then, reality crashes in and you're back to your crappy life. (right?)  for me, it goes a little deeper. i have actually been in dreams and been reminded of ppl and locations FROM OTHER DREAMS. but those things do not exist! i have had dreams where i interact with close friends, but they are not real ppl i know. i have even had fake girlfriends, and even been reminded, in dreams, of ex-dream-girlfriends! when i wake up, i do not know who any of the ppl were, even though i can picture their faces and stuff. every couple of nights, i will go back to that neighborhood and hang out with my fake friends again. and of course, there are dozens of other identities and locations, which i revisit time and again. this has gone on for years. i have all these different alterego universes...in my subconcious.  so, basically my mind is using valuable memory space to store all these scenarios. and they are linear. let's say i dream about trying to find a job in suburbland on monday. the next night, i'll be in warriorland with its storyline and identity. some time later, i'll dream about suburbland again, and pick up where i left off. this time, i'll be at a job interview, as though no time has passed! what is that all about?! i mean, in all these dream lives, i have a specific personality with habits, memories, and motivators. why does my mind feel the need to file all of these character traits? is it really necessary for these dream lives to have a past? especially when i usually have lucidity and understand that it is a dream and not real, while it is taking place. i knew a native american woman who told me that when she dreamed, she would watch someone else's life unfold. she said it was part of her culture, and she could even choose a specific person to inhabit ahead of time. she also claimed that she could control their actions, and mess up their day if they had pissed her off. is that real? maybe when ppl on the other side of earth are sleeping, one of them is passively watching my life, and it does not make sense to them. perhaps, i am not who i think i am, but only a drifting spirit who is in this body today and must act accordingly to my prefabricated personality? does any of this make sense, or does it sound like the rantings of a crazy person? i have tried to understand this for some time. do you dream like this?

      well, it has been 4 days since i last had a cigarette. *twiiitttchhh twitch* i stopped smoking on july 8. i am currently using the patch. i've tried the gum: i end up gnawing every piece of it out of existence, when you are only supposed to chew into it once every half hour. that results in a headache, from nicotine flooding my system. man, i am chewing gum right now until my teeth hurt, so the gum is a bad idea. i've tried the pill: it has all kinds of wierd side effects. plus, it's crazy expensive. i think you have to have a doctor or something... hell, i even quit for 2 years on the patch. but the patch is great. i do not feel the physical addiction as heavily, which lets me use all my energy battling the mental addicton. you know, after every meal, that morning one, the last one before you go to bed, some kind of sick reward for getting in the car and having a destination, because traffic stresses you out, in between classes, during breaks at work, because i have 3 minutes to kill...ah....cigarette....guuurgle. unfortunately, there are some side effects. i get hot flashes (trish likes to tease me by saying i have menopause), and my skin gets blotchy, or i feel like i'm going to pass out. and then i feel fine. it comes and goes in a cycle. wtf!  man, is this tough. i started smoking when i was 12. this won't be too hard, though, because here lately i have been smoking around 6 a day. i am so sick of this disgusting habit. that is why i started on step 2. the first couple days were surprisingly easy. today and last night, i have just been thinking about the act of smoking nonstop. sometimes i pace around or sit there zoned out for ten minutes. aaaghh!  last night trish offered me encouragement by saying, "you're almost done". and i responded, "yeah, only 50 more years to go!"

      ok, i was watching the news (big shock) and i caught this blurb about a 727 aircraft being stolen from some podunk airstrip in africa. then, there was an unconfirmed report of it's sighting in canada. and our helpful (colorcoded) govt. has been giving us warnings all week about a possible airline hijacking/jihad/911 thing happening soon. well, i think that it is silly to think that the terrorists (from the country of terror) will duplicate the 2001 attack. it would be sneakier to fill a small aircraft with a nuclear/chemical/concussionary bomb and fly low (under the radar) and smack into washington dc, or any metro area for that matter... unfortunately, there has been no other mention in the media of this! arg! all i can find is coverage of the kobe bryant case. i could seriously care less about that whole affair. weapons of mass distraction? just wanted to say my piece in case this is important. if not, just refer back to the title of the blog.

DOH! and wouldn't you know it, the  next night when we have tickets to see DAVE ATTELL and LEWIS BLACK, my dear wife accidently trips and falls off of a curb @ work and broke (shattered) her ankle/leg! yikes! thankfully, she is ok. but, sheesh, what did we do to deserve such a fate?  needless to say, i had not slept for over 3 days...speaking of which, it is time to take a serious nap.

      aha. we paid turkey !8.5 Billion! dollars to make them not use unilateral military force against the kurds in northern iraq. so, we are bribing them to not do what we just did in iraq?!

      my life is getting worse. the code for my old blog archives is being retarded. i need to reformat that. trish is in a wheelchair. so, i have that going for me. i cannot find a job, not that i would have any time to work, anyway. my art is suffering. i feel myself progressively detaching emotionally from the human race. if no one knows that i am alive right now, then who will care what i did when i am gone?

      man, i have fallen in love with morrowind. so, i joined the forums, looking for comradery (SP). i really enjoy helping out ppl with questions, but i all i get is animosity. the ppl that have been playing the game for years are so rude. and god forbid you play hardball with them. they just act like a bunch of little kids and take their toys away. its very unprofessional in my opinion. mainly the moderators. they play favorites and let their friends badmouth me on the forums. then, when i go to respond or defend myself-  they delete my posts!!  thats just sad. to think that i enjoy this game so much but the community has scorned me. oh well, it won't be the first or the last society to ostracize me. i'll just stay away from the "community" forums, and keep helping out ppl. the worst part is that i have to design a better game than bethseda did, so i can put them out of busines...:OP

      so, its no big secret that i watch alot of news. anyway, the other day i was watching a cnn movie review about the star of PASSION being in a new golf movie. one of the talking heads managed to say something stupid about the actor trying to keep from being typecast from his last major role. excuse me, but you CANNOT be typecast as jesus! what? is there a sequel or something (passion 3: the spanish inquisition)? maybe he could make cameos on popular tv shows like the oc...and there's always the talk show circuit. "oprah, i just worry that i'll never be able to live up to my dad. he made life, all i can make is wine and fish. i feel like such a failure. sob!" or even maury povich- "find out the paternity test results, who really is the father of jesus, mary's husband or jehovah, after the commercial break..."

         whoa. less than an hour ago (when i started typing), iraq was officially granted sovereignty! why would they push the handover ahead 2 days? well, what happens now? do all of our troops come home today? yeah, right. good luck with all of that. well, we saw "fahrenheit 9/11" today. i'm sure everyone has their own story, and here is mine. we went twice before, but each time it was sold out and/or no seating available. i am surprised at that kind of response. of course, it's only playing in like 800 theatres, i think. there were young and old inside; a nice cross section of liberal america.  i had questions concerning michael moore's treatment of the sensitive 9/11 footage. would he showcase the imagery for the sake of cinema? all i will say about it, is that he was respectful and it was one of the first poignant moments in the film. he understood that we all have those images scorched into our memories... it is a significant documentary. i believe that everybody should see it, to truly understand it's power. it was emotional and visceral. i could sense much (or all) of the audience was feeling the message as well,at least on some level. at times, NOBODY would make a sound. it was eerie and kind of comforting to know other humans, much less americans, were actually paying attention to such a serious subject. there was only one innapropriate outburst (laugh) the whole time. there were many humorous moments, along with heartbreaking ones. around the time john ashcroft(?)started singing, i began to feel myself detach from the movie content. it became surreal, as though i was watching a story from a book or movie plot about a fictional country. at the end, we all clapped for a while. by the time i left, i felt like crying or vomiting. that kind of information helps me to understand why joey pants' character in "the matrix" wanted to go back inside the matrix...

      "Hyperrealism" is a term i coined to describe the increased interest in "photorealism" within the digital art medium. it goes beyond mere imitation of photography; almost a blind devotion to make reality appear better. sadly, it is all fake. it seems too fake. for example, take "final fantasy" (the movie, but the games do it too) and "the animatrix: last flight of the osiris". instead of using actors, they try to portray actual humans with rendered 3d models. it has to be more expensive to go that route. why not use live actors? i can only imagine it is a symptom of a larger vanity, like a reliance on cutting edge technology. the sega genesis prided itself on it's "superior" graphics (technically SNES had better graphics). the company spent alot of time marketing games with pretty colors, but ended up failing time and again. the company focused their new products around this ideal of hyperrealism. all of their platforms and systems failed. the lesson they never learned was this: nobody played pacman for the graphics, it was all about gameplay. that is a lesson current developers fail to recognize.  now i'm not trying to say that a game should have crappy graphics. however, if the gameplay keeps your fingers working and causes you to lose track of time, then the designer has done his job. anyone can get over less than glossy graphics. another problem with the fakeness of hyperrealism is apparent in hollywood movies and television commercials. i am reminded of a commercial where two ppl are standing in a street with buffaloes charging at them. i never felt a real sense of danger for the actors. the director obviously wanted us to take pity on the hapless couple, otherwise why stage a stampeding herd of buffalo? another image i can think of, would be the climax of "matrix: revolutions". it seems a horrific idea to have hundreds of killer robots falling through the hole in the ceiling. the reality of the visuals is that i feel no sense of impending doom. i was a casual observer of the drama unfolding. none of the characters could get hurt or experience pain. it was simply ridiculously implausible. i became completely unattached to the story at that point. it's always a bad idea to slap your viewers upside the head with a message that you are watching a movie. it's all about suspending beliefs, not reality crashing into your fantasy. read more about how the human mind perceives  urlLink overly-manufactured reality .

PS:ok, so i guess i did not invent the phrase "hyperrealism". it is a style/movement in photographic history.

      well, this story recently broke, and i wanted to document my thoughts on the subject. you see, everytime i come up with a brilliant idea, someone in a better position to act on it than me also does. i don't usually like to divulge this kind of information, but i have been working on a story over the past year. here is an excerpt from the premise: "...The continents are inhabited by disorganized workers who mine the planet’s various minerals/ resources. The trade is negotiated between the elite, upper class, who dwell in space stations orbiting the planet; and the workers below, by trade guilds located strictly and permanently on the surface.  A massive spider web of rail lines, encased in protective glass tubes, stretch across the countryside. At the center of the hub is a towering elevator/railway, also encased in protective glass, leading into the sky. It reaches up through the atmosphere as a means of supplying the elite with finished products of their precious resources. At the bottom of this tube are factories used to process the resources. The railways ship raw minerals and such from outlying mines and farms to this location..." now take a look at this:   urlLink curse you, NASA!  i am a little discouraged, even though this is not central to the plot. by the time my finished story comes out, that concept might seem unoriginal.
