      aaahhh. Ok thanks alot sara! I go an IM adam for you and he warns me! to 20% of course! Oh no but when I go to warn sara it goes "you have just warned supersara135 from 0% to 5% even though you got warned to 20% on one shot, so fick you!" ok i'm paraphrasing but u get the point. aim is so inconsistant. hey speaking of freakishly inconsistant things, my printer, jack, (yes i named him and i named many other things too, u'll see them mentioned later in the blog no doubt) is really random. In the middle of printing it will spit out a piece of blank paper and then just keep printing! what is that!. And when u turn it on he either makes lots of really wierd computery noises or it makes no noises at all and is just ready. grrr. what a pos. hahaha ok i'm done. for now

      yes fixed it! alright so anywho yeah i saw die another day on friday. It was... disappointing. Like there are many plot holes in the movie, and *sob* pierce brosnan is getting chunky and is losing his appeal dispite the dead sexiness of his english accent. Ok and is it just me or did the evil guy look a bit like Conan O'brien? yeah i thought so. I was thinking that the whole time. It made it really hard for me to take him seriously. ps john cleese is my hero and a half. Ok moving on I watched 10 things i hate about you twice yesterday, so 20 things i hate about you (lol Hannah). It was amazing! I am so in love with that movie. In the next entry you will see several hillarious quotes from the movie. mmm heath...  ps my favorite scene from that movie is when heath sings to julia, mmmm

      alright so i just picked up my sis from school. My mother is working in the city today so she wasn't home to pick her up. She left three notes in the house to remind me i was like CHRIST MOTHER, ONE WOULD SUFFICE! Yeah there was one on the back door where i come in from the bus stop, one on the fridge, two feet away from the back door, and one on the comp. Omg i am not THAT much of a ditz. Hmm anywho. So i got my composition back from la today. It was about my insane italian relatives. She writes at the bottom "this is an excellent oppurtunity to learn italian, it wouldn't hurt you to learn a few phrases. I was like ew, who died and made you queen of the bitches. Besides I'd like to see her learn italian from Uncle John talking to her, ha fat chance. OMG AIM IS REALLY SCREWED UP!!! the comp goes to the aim window automatically. Whenever I click on Internet Exploror it just goes to AIM. And when I quit out it just signs itself back on automatically. It's really scary. Gata go restart. Be back later, maybe, to finish typing about my day (s). byeee, wish me luck.

      omg yesterday was just a barrel of laughs. Me and Madeline decided to be secret agents. So our plan was to go down to the acme dressed in all black and execute Operation double cc (i can't explain what it is, if i did i'd have to kill you, sorry). So i'm walking over to madeline's house dressed in all black, and she had to borrow black pants, so i was bringing some over for her. It was raining and I didn't want to get them wet, so I thought "hey why carry them normally in a plastic bag, when i can freak people out" So I put the sweatpants under my coat to make it look like I was pregnant. It was hillarious! All these old women were tsk-ing me. And everyone in their cars were like staring at me. Oh god, it was most entertaining. And all the cars let me cross the street first, it was amazing. When I got to Madeline's, her mom looks at me and is like "oh god" and i'm like "don't worry it's just sweatpants. Madeline was laughing pretty hard. It was great. Yeah so then we walked down to the acme, but we pit stopped at the pet shop, of course. Cute little puppies! And like everyone was staring at us and we were like, umm ok. But then we realized it was because we looked like we just came from a funeral. But there was this one guy, I think he was like sixteen or something, and he kept like following us around, and we're like um, yeah lets go to acme now... Well before we went we watched this sad little kitten for a while. It had been like ostrasized. I wanted to buy it just so it would be like loved. I felt so bad. But I couldn't buy it, sigh. (1) I didn't have any money (2) my dad is allergic and drugs are apparently below him. jackass. Anywho so we go to Acme and more people stare at us. And we tried to execute operation double cc, but the enemy got there first. So we played with the cookie dough for a while. That was amusing. Then we got ben and jerry, Vanilla Caramel Fudge, mmmm. And we bought a pack of plaztic spoons to eat it with. That was pretty funny. Then we walked home and it was scary, cuz it was all dark and so bloody cold. Yeah that was basically my night. It was tres amusing.

      Wow now my dreams are copying of movies! Check it out, Shakespeare in love as seen through allie’s eyes. ok so the first thing i remember is that I am in band and after we preformed we all went up to meet the queen. After i had greeted her or whatever but there were still people in line to see her, all these soldiers came and were like “alright who stole the priceless tiles” or something like that. Aprenently i was one of the revolutionists that did it so i ran with all these people in rags but like in Shakespeare like time clothes. So i start running with them and as i’m going i take off the band uniform and underneath i have like peasant clothes. So i become part of this peasant bandit club thing, but i’m still really rich at the same time, and I have to hide that i’m a revolutionary from my rich family (which still lives in the house i live in now, only like Shakespearized) and i have to hide the fact that i am rich from my bandit people’s. Well all but one. He doesn’t have a name.  But he looks like the guy that played Shakespeare in “ Shakespeare in love.” So we are all hanging out on some rooves in the slums. That guy gives me this charm thing, as a sign of love or something like that. Somebody mentions the play they are putting on, Romeo and Juliet. They need a juliet, bam, i get the part. So i have to sneak out of the house to get to the rehearsals. So i am back in my room and this woman who is supposed to be my mom is like trying to get me ready to meet the queen. So i have to where this really big red dress. My “mother” says that i have to wear my charm necklace, so we’re looking for all the charms on the floor. I have to wear one for my fiance to be or something along those lines, and one for my family and one for the queen one for my country and one for myself. I see the nameless man’s charm on the floor and i just put it on the necklace and say “i can’t remember who it’s for but better safe than sorry” when my “mom” leaves I take off the dress and i’m in a white slip thing and i’m trying to get on boys clothes or something, because my “mum” said that the nameless man was like actually rich. So i get dressed in these guys clothes, and i’m just about to sneak out the window when i hear the queen sneaking up the stairs, and suddenly i am back in just a slip, and i don’t want her to see me because she’ll know that i stole the tiles. So I hide behind the door and the queen is like “oh she’s not here lets go back downstairs” So then i come out of the door and then the queen opens the door again, and she sees me there, so I jump out the window and start running until i find the nameless man. Now i am in the boy’s clothes. We are like backstage. He starts kissing me. Then he notices my fiance’s charm on my necklace. He aks me what it is. And i say “you know i’m engaged, I have to wear the charm, but i wore yours too, i still love you. I had to lie though, to wear it” he said he understood. Then we had to go on stage and i was dressed in girls clothes again. At the end scene when we all bowed he looked at me like he knew that we couldn’t be together anymore. But then after the play we went outside. I was riding on his back and we were running through the park. It was good fun. Then we fall and we’re laying on a blanket in the park. And we start making out again. And we’re all like “ i love you so much” Then we see my fiance coming and we start to run, but it’s too late. He sees the nameless man and they start fighting. My fiance looses. Then me and the nameless guy go to a play or something and during the intermission there are all these like old basketball players and the stage is now a court. And i turn to the nameless man is like holding some other girls hand and i’m like “WHOA, what is this” and he goes “what who are you, stop holding my hand” and then to me he says “i swear i don’t know her, she’s just some girl i met on the bus” and i like groan. Then i slump down in  my seat. Then I woke up.

      alright I am going to tell everyone what my day was like yesterday. I went to the mall with laurel, heather, steve, anna, and ashley. That was pretty interesting. It was like tease allie day, but hey whatever I got the new Tori cd, YAY, thank you laurel!!!!! Yeah the mall was fun. Then that night I had to go to my parents friends house, that was torture... First of all I was the only SANE person there, because all the "adults" hot wasted and then there were all these little people that of course i was left to baby sit. grr. Then we watched the Royal Tenebaums which was just disturbing. I don't care if the girl is adopted it's still incest. Anywho, so the people's house we were at, their kids are so spoiled. They have their parents like completely wrapped, its really sad. They have absolutely no parenting skills at all. And my parents are all "they're not that bad" and i'm like yeah that's cuz ur not the ones who have to watch them while everyone else gets trashed and has gand ol' drunk time. hmm anywho yeah that was my day.

      yeah sounds good. ok so first of all science test today... oh god! i can smell the F. Ok i am going to fill everyone in on the secret lives of the appliance type objects in my house, that i have named anyway. Ok first here is a list of all the names and the item the go with:george- my comp, mike- the keyboard, fred esteban- mouse, fredrica- sewing machine, jack-printer, fran- fax machine, claudia- electric pencil sharpener. Ok so, now that you know who they are.. now of course george is insanely popular, because well he is. Jack and Fran are like really cliquey and they exlude everyone else. Well except for George(of course) Fred Esteban because Fran is madly in love with him. They went out for a while but fred e. never really liked fran and only went out with her out of pity and was secretly dating fredrica on the side. Now when fran found out about this (jack told her because he saw them sneakin around and stuff) she got so mad she dumped him imediately. This left fred e. and fredrica free to see eachother publicly. Fredrica however is very fickle and dumped him for george, who is insanely popular. Fran was still majorly pissed for being two timed, so she seduced george until he gave up fredrica for her. But george soon realized that he was really in love with claudia, the mild mannered pencil sharpener. But George had a problem, because jack was also insanely obsessed with claudia. Jack and George were constantly fighting over her. Eventually George won of course because he is insanely popular. Jack was depressed for a long time but eventually got over it, he is now dating fran, which is working out well since they had been friends for so long first. Meanwhile, mike had his eye on the now single fredrica. Unfortunately fredrica is still having a hard time getting over george, after all he is INSANELY popular. Mike is still trying to get her to go out with him. It's actually quite sweet.

Three men find a jeanie and the jeanie says "tell me what you want people to say about you at your funeral, for example 'he was a great humanitarian' or 'he was the richest man i knew' and i will make it come true" the first man said "i want people to say 'he was the greatest football player of all time'" and the jeanie grants it then the second guy says something like "he was the nicest trillionare i ever met" and then the jeanie asked the third guy "what do you want people to say about you at your funeral, and the third guy says "'OH MY GOD, HE'S MOVING!'"

Yeah this kid like ran into me and i managed to keep balanced, but just leave me to skate by my self and i'll trip over myself. oy ve. So then we went to the Oregon Diner in philly, except the "rego" part was like not lighten up, so it was the "on diner" anyway this guy gave us free pastries because we were italian.... (he worked there though, like he got us stuff from the counter, he wasn't some crazy from the street) mmmm cookie.... Yeah so then we came home and here we are. Tonite we are going to my cousins' house for new years. That should be fun. We'll get to make fun of the drunk adults, woot. alright i'm tired of typing i'll update tomarrow, maybe.

      AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg i haven't been online since LAST MONDAY! we had to disconnect the computer to put it in the other room to act as a stereo because ours broke. Yeah and apperently we needed a stereo because my family was coming over for xmas eve. Ok so now i have to tell everyone what has happened for the past week. Alright on tuesday (xmas eve) my family came over and that's just not even worth going into detail about. But i did get 10 things i hate about you, which is always a plus. Then christmas we opened more presents and i got lotr on dvd WOOT and i got a cook book from the oh-so-sexy, oh-so-talented, oh-so-british Jamie Oliver. WOOT again. Then tursday i went to see two towers (again) with heather laurel and madeline. Madeline had cut her own hair so after the movie we like ambushed her trying to get her hair down. Everyone was staring at us like "omg why are they gang raping her" but its nice to know that no matter how loud you scream people won't come to help you, only point and say "wow what losers." Yeah so while we were trying to get madeline's hair down and we're all like yelling and shit this guy like 50 feet away goes "yo are you talking to me" and we're like "does it look like we're talking to you, you stupid egomaniac!" Anyway, on friday pretty much nothing happened, my parents friends came over and brought their kids. They brought dvds with them, how sad is that they have to be constantly watching tv. Anyway so we watched star wars 2. mmm ewan mcgreggor. Everyone loved Hayden Christenson (sp?) in that movie but i disagree its all about ewan. Then saturday my uncle and aunt came down, that was cool-ish. Then on sunday anna came over, and then we went to see two towers (her 2nd time, my 3rd). Yup thats pretty much all that happened. woot. bubye.

      Ok so my parents dragged me to this party at their friends house on saturday night. It was weird. But there was the irish guy there and i'm like, wow can i stalk you. And omg, ok those of you who know who dtl is, know that he's kinda, well in-the-closet. Well there was this guy there, elliot, and he had this rugby shirt on (dtl-ish) and glasses just like dtl and a voice just like dtl only he was like out of the closet and i'm like OMG ITS FUTURE DTL! it was pretty fun. Aka boring beyond reason. And for some reason the hosts, john and diane, just know a lot of really weird people! like this woman who is just weird, i won't even go there. But even the irish guy was a little out there, Haha. Ok so now i'm done telling about saturday, nothing happened on sunday pretty much. I went shopping. So i was finishing up shopping today con mi madre. and we're driving out of the parking lot of zagara's and we realize we have a flat tire, so we pull into another parking spot. And i'm like "ma! our shit shack on wheels is falling apart... again" and she goes "its just the tire" and i'm like "yeah cuz its like ten years old! and the spare tire is older!" and she's like "it'll be fine" and then this guy, bill from gradyville, comes up and he's like "i'll help you with your tire" and we're like "yay thanks bill from gradyville" and mom held is little kid, little billy from gradyville. What a helpful guy. My mom still insists that the tire had nothing to do with our crap wagon car, but we all know thats not true, right? hahaha. yeah so thats pretty much what happened. Oh god tomarrow is xmas eve and yeah my mom tricked me into volunteering to help cook... all day... and i'm like "ok do you not like these people your cooking for" and she's putting my in charge of cutting/dicing/chopping and i'm like do you not want me to have all my fingers...? anywhat thats pretty much everything i can think of. I'll try and write more later, if i remember, i haven't lately.

      omg! ok so i saw lord of the rings the two towers yesterday. it was totally ZING! except (ok sorry in advance to anyone this will offend) frodo and sam seemed well, not straight... like when frodo is about to stab sam sam goes "mr. frodo don't you remember me, its your sam, its your sam mr. frodo" oh god i almost had a heart attack trying not to laugh at that. But then at the end when sam goes "do you think we'll ever be a story mr. frodo. 'i want to here about that brave frodo, dad'" and then frodo goes "your leaving out a cheif character, sam the brave. I want to hear about sam. Frodo wouldn't have gotten anywhere without sam. Frodo needs Sam." Thats where i lost it, i couldn't help laughing, I wanted to be quiet because people always hate people who laugh in theaters at inoppertune times but it was soooo FUNNY! i discussed this with camille and the resulting conversation was quite amusing, here is the funniest part (i think)  LOTRBabe (1:24 PM):	lol!!!!!! i know! i leaned over to my friend kaysea and was all "frodo likes talking in 3rd person"

      ok so as i was saying... raise your hand if your dad is a complete jackass *raises hand* wow look at that... Alright so my dad comes home and he's like "why didn't anyone shovel the sidewalk" and gio's like "well mom was sick" and then he turns to me and is like "what about you, you sat around all day and didn't even bother to shovel the sidewalk" i'm like "i was at madeline's all day" and he goes off mumbling shit to himself, and then later like half and hour before we were gonna leave for the hockey game that he promised he would take me too two WEEKS ago, he walks into the living room and says "i invited john crane (one of his friends) instead, is that ok?" i'm like "surrrrre, why not" and it was all because i didn't shovel the fucking sidewalk. Like oh because i didn't shovel the sidewalk your gonna be pety and give my BOX SEAT to someone else. Can you get anymore fucking childish, its like alright and you call me immature, i'm 14, you fucker, your 45. JESUS CHRIST grow up and act your age. And then my mom DEFENDS him, she's like "well he doesn't feel apreciated" i'm like "oh poor dad, he had to walk through a little snow to get to the door, i feel sooo bad for him. Just because he thought we expected him to shovel the snow doesn't mean we really did, so if he jumps to his own dumbass conclusions that his problem not mine." and i was gonna freak at him today but he's not even here, he's in chester or something for work. Thats right, run little man. Run.

      yeah wow yesterday i went to madeline's house so we could go sledding. So we go sledding at Glen Providence Park with the hot pink sleds. It was amazing. Madeline made us go all the way over the the other side of the hill cuz she was scared of the "big kids" hahahaha. ohh that madeline. Yeah anyway so we're sledding and then we get to the bottom of the hill and we dont feel like walking back up the hill so we go down to the pond. And I'm like "I bet we could throw one of these sleds across the pond, try" so madeline throws a sled and it only goes like seven feet and i'm like NO. So madeline goes and breaks off this huge branch of a tree and is like here use this so i try to use it but on top of the ice there is all this mushy slush stuff so its kinda stuck. And i'm like oh great I gata go walk out on this. So i walk out a little into the pond, where i was it wasn't ice it was just slush and then dirt, so i went about ankle + deep in that and then i hit ice and my feet are like freezing, so i get the sled and madeline's like "wow i can't help thinking this is my fault" I'm like "yeah it is" so then we look at the waterfall for a while and then we're like "yeah i'm cold" so we walk back to her house and we put our clothes in the dryer then we watched labrynth. That movie with David Bowie as the goblin king (i know i know) anyway but these goblins were like running around or something and like talking in goblin talk and then one of them yells "oh my aching pussy!" only like in a japanese accent so more like (spelled phenetically) "awe, my aching-a poo-sy" but it was like really loud and i'm like omg what did he just say and we rewind it and we're like OMG, so we watched that part like fifty times, it was amazing. yeah and then i'm like "look at david bowie, standin there thinkin he's god" and madeline goes "david bowie IS god" it was amazing. Yeah then we studied for science for a bit, then i walked home. More to come but now madeline wants me to check her blog, brb.

      yeah so yesterday we (me kelly hannah and maddie) had to present a project in global studies. It was soooo very bad. We didn't even finish the poster until about two periods before it was due. And during the presentation me and kelly were passing out food and maddie and hannah are continuing the posters and maddie points to a picture and says "this is Jordan's current leader, King Hussien" and Ms. Breslin goes "actually he died in January" and we're like "oh my god...." And then after us the PERFECT students go up aka Aimee (the bitch on wheels with a pole up her ass) and Amy and Jess and Alex and theirs is like perfection with sugar on top. And we're all sitting at our desks like "gonna fail, gonna fail, gonna fail"

      alright now it is time for me to admit my three greatest obsessions:   1.Indiana Jones. It's the whole manly thing i guess. I don't know but i am just in love with the movies. Also for some reason i love how he carries that green bag behind him/over him shoulder. I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS. ps i want a bag like that it'd be cool. oh right and the hat is just amazingly sexy. alright moving on...   2. Hot English/Australian/Irish/Scotish but mainly English guys. I think we all know the logic behin this one.   and last but not least... 3. the song "can't help falling in love" by elvis presley. I know what your thinking, but this just happens to be my favorite song, alright? haha. I dont know what it is but its just so sweet. My dream guy will sing this to me when he proposes. hint hint. lol jk. just kidding everyone, just kidding!

      alright just got back from the godforsaken cultural wasteland that is bradford pennsylvania. Here enly the highlights/details/main events of my weekend.  11.27.02   *seven hour drive to bradford, after school. Of course   *stayed up til 4 am watching Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Arc. I am such a Indiana maniac. It's a bizarre obsession, i know.   *forced to sleep on air matress with my sister   11.28.02 (thanksgiving day)   *slept til about 12:30 ish   *didn't shower til around 3 ish   *aunt oliva arrived just before dinner   *ate WAY to much. I had a traditional italian american meal. Polenta, potatoes, lasagna, and 5 different kinds of pie. mmmm pie....   * p.s. cousin becoming increasingly too close for comfort   * watched the elvis thing on TV, lots of good music babe.   11.29.02   *slept in til about 12 ish   *aunt bonnie and nona oliva came over, wish uncle luke came with them, he's so cool and he has the greatest car EVER. Its a convertable porshe thingy. Its amazing. Plus I haven't seen him in a while.   *sat around and "talked" to nona oliva even though she is old as dirt and only speaks italian. Fun stuff.   *watched "the brady bunch in the white house" with cousin and lil sis   *ps any movie in which one or more of the brady's are president/vice president of the united states is automatically the WORST movie in exsistance. bar none.   *went to bed pretty early since aunt oliva was sleeping on the couch, hahaha nona oliva kicked her out of her bed.   *was awake for about two hours in bed because it sounded like there was a harley convention on the other side of the room. aka MY PARENTS SNORE LIKE BEARS. they were like alternating snoring too, so it was like one continual *ssssnnnnnnnnnnngggggggrrrfffffhhhhhhh!@#$%^&((&^%$hfasklfj oaseiru owfuaseiof useiofu* from the both of them.   11.30.02   *slept till around 11:30 ish   *mum and aunt oliva went visiting while i was in the shower. They went and visited my aunt bridget and uncle tony without me! Bridget being the only tolerable person in the FAMILY. But hey its not like i said "i really wanna see bridget this Trip" or anything like that, OH WAIT A SEC! hmm anyway no hard feelings...   *i watched Meet Joe Black with my cousin and sis. It was pretty good. We had to stop midway though because bonnie's friend donna came over and we had to be all polite and talk to her.    *A couple HOURS in to the conversation it turned to dream analasis. Apparently, according to nona oliva, if in your dream you see a fuit or grain growing on a hill when its out of growing season, then someone is going to die. And if you see a dog barking in your dream, then whoever its barking at will die. I was like wow, this is morbid.... and insane. But it was kinda scary because nona oliva dreamed about grapes on a hill before uncle tulio/nelo (dont ask) died, and before francis's cousin (?) died. I was like alright new topic...   *After everyone left we watched the rest of Meet Joe Black only this time i got to here it in italian to because my gramma was translating it for nona oliva. It was kind of distracting after a while actually.   *After that movie we watched "holiday inn" some old movie with bing crosby (ps bing is just the greatest name ever) and fred astaire. wasn't bad. It was kinda funny though, because it one of the songs bing is the only person playing an instraument, the piano, but the piano is the only instraument you can't here in the song.   *went to bed, made a point of getting to sleep BEFORE my parents did so i wouldn't have to hear their snoring.   12.1.02   *woke up to dad lecturing me about something. Only heard half of his droning. Stupid man, maybe he should wake me up before he yells at me so his speach has a better effect.   *I had a mosterous breakfast, thank god my gramma can cook   *nona oliva/bonnie gave the family 150 dollars, total. It was in check form. Thats 37.50 each. I figured that out QUITE fast.   *looooooong drive ahead of us.   *yeah so about two minutes in i got sick of talking to my family, dad was just pissing me off to a massive degree, so i listened to scarlets walk. sigh, the batteries didn't last long though.   *a couple hours in we passed a truck carrying all these calves, off to slaughter. I almost puked.   *We stopped to get some food, got vanilla coke *yay*ate for about half an hour, then left.    *We were immediately hit with 30 miles of stand still traffic because of a 25 car pile up. I dont think anyone was seriously hurt though because they cleared it pretty quickly, well pretty quickly for 25 cars.   *a couple more hours in the drive we hit 6 miles of backed up traffic. We later found out it was because people were slowing down to look at a flashing sign. *puts hand over face and hangs head in shame for the people who cause six miles of backed up traffic just from looking at a sign*   *got home, gramma sent us home with MUCH extra food. Immediately found the marzipan and inhaled it.   *got online and typed all this up.

      wow so there is this thing on laurel's blog about the pentagon. yeah its about how what really happened was that an explosive truck hit the pentagon on 9.11 instead of a plane. And they had all these facts and stuff, but then its like "ok, but remember the phone calls from the people on the plane, and remember how now they are missing. hmmm...." major flaw in the conspriricy theory there. oh the sites on the internet!

      oh my god in science today madeline and me were making a windmill and it had to like spin. It was the most retarded looking thing ever, and it wouldn't SPIN. and then the little spokey thingies kept falling off so by the time we had to test it for mr. samilenko there were only two left. And we're like "we'll just take the f now" but he steals it from us anyway and is like "you have to test it" and when he put it in front of the fan it like flops over and dies and then another spokey thing falls off and the whole time we are like pissing ourselves laughing. It was good. but then he laughed at us like "your pathetic" and we're like "shut up yanni's number one fan!"

      	 The Weakness in Me- Joan Armatrading   I'm not the sort of person Who falls in and quickly out of love But to you I gave my affection Right from the start I have a lover who loves me How could I break such a heart Yet still you get my attention CHORUS: Why do you come here When you know I've got troubles enough Why do you call me When you know I can't answer the phone You make me lie when I don't want to And you make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool And you make me stay when I should not Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me Why do you come here And pretend to be just passing by But I mean to see you And I mean to hold you Tightly Feeling guilty worried Waking from tormented sleep Oh this old love has me bound But the new love cuts deep If I choose now I'll lose out Oh one of you has to fall And I need you and you CHORUS

We have our own isle in payless. Go us. We were walking around. We both got winded walking up the stairs. We had to rest and sit on a bench. hahaha ouch. Yeah so there was this kid in gap kid and she was like staring at us. So we stared back. And then laurel stuck her tongue out. Then the scary kid stuck her tongue out. So i stuck my tongue out at her. And then she stalked us to gap and we like stared at her more. Then she like pointer her index finger at us like she was giving us the finger, only it was the wrong finger and we're like, ooook. Yeah then i came home and did nothing. Then my dad decided to watch the superbowl so i got online, found out that tori is playing live on the radio, freaked out, updated blog. Now here i am. Oh right and i'm in some random chat room anna invited me too. i know like no people here, and apparently someone thinks they are god... hmmm. Not gonna go there.

      OMG one of my cousins from the funeral looks JUST like sean bean (pronounced, seen been). Well he looked a little different like younger and with brown hair but god it was uncanny. I really wanted to call him Seen Been, but considering it was a funeral that would be horribly inapropriate. haha. Yeah. I can't believe i've never seen this person before! omg it was hillarious.

      so today i went to my aunt marg's funeral. I didn't even know her. I seriously think this is the first time i have ever seen her. It was just gonna be my dad, but he wanted me to come so I could meet his side of the family. I know like everyone on my mom's side but i only know like immediate family on my dad's side. So i met all these really bizarre people. Jesus the stories in this family. It's funny everytime my mom-mom sees my aunt peg she says "put that man in a home" and by "that man" she means her husband. Hillarious really. But seriously that family is like a frigging soap opera. I don't have enough room/time to say all the stuff i heard today/knew already about his family. But just extremely screwed up. Yeah but I found out today that my old landlord from when we lived in Philly was in the Mafia and he was in jail for most of the time we lived in that house. And our neighbor's dad was a numbers man for the mafia. And we lived a block away from the projects (that right there tell ya what a great neighborhood that was, lol) So it's like wow, learn something new everyday. Yeah so then i came home and now i'm burning a copy of my dad's cd, Sticky Fingers- Rolling Stones. Good Cd.OMG my dad bought The Donnas cd. and i'm like "WHAT THE HELL!!!" and he goes "some girl at work recommended it" and we listened to it on the car ride to the funeral home, and i'm like wow this sucks and he's like yeah it does and i'm like yeah so worth the money, and he's like shut up. Yeah i wish he had told me he was gonna by that cd, i would have talked him out of it. hmm anyway i think thats it. adios

      ok so i went to the movies with laurel today. It was great. We saw lotr, again. *gasp* Yeah so her dad is like driving us there and i found out that we used to live in the same house on west second street. Well not at the same time obviously. He lived there in like the seventies. cool stuff. So then we go to the mall for a bit before the movie starts. We got pretzels and sat in these chairs that like "massage" you. aka it feels like someone is sitting inside the chair molesting you. It's really creepy actually. Laurel told me about orange chicken. Sounds... twisted. it's like two random flavors put together, orange and chicken, its like making pizza flavored marshmellows. eeeewwww. Yeah to then we went to the movie. It was great. We laughed through the whole thing. During this like dramatic part laurel is like slurping her soda, ya know like trying to get the very last bit at the bottom. "and i'm like way to kill the drama, 'NOOO'*slurp slurp*" she was laughing for like ten minutes and i'm like "shut up!" It was funny. There were like a total of eight people in the theater, including us. woo, good times. So then laurel calls  her dad and we're like waiting for twenty minutes for him to pick us up. while we're waiting laurel is talking about her pretzels and she goes "they're cold" and i'm like "and pretzely" and she's like "OMG i was gonna say that!" freakAY.

Yeah and speaking of that saddo, he wore a black turtleneck sweatshirt and we're all like "why would you wear that again, you look like such a frigging retard!" poor confused man. OMG our math sub today was amazing, he looked like a bald fat gene wilder. he was hillarious, only not on purpose. He's all "yeah those sun valley kids" and i'm like "your my god" So kelly wanted a picture of me, and i was like "ok but i have to find a good one." So i come home and i try to take a picture of myself thats good. and well that didn't work. So my sister took a picture of me, and that one is good. I sent laurel all my tries. We had a good time laughing at them. good times good times..

      ok i would like to clarify something, I'm not trying to win on laurel's blog even though it was my genius that noted laurel's blog and its oscarness but whatever. Anyway i wasn't trying to win, i was just saying that laurel betrayed me because she was all "steve be funnier." thats it. No "winning" involved. There now i'm done and i'll blog about this no longer, because its stupid and it doesn't deserve as much time as i have devoted to joking about it. hahaha, oh me and my lack of life, wooo

      ok so in gym Mrs. Doyle was like whipping us with a noodle (floaty pool things) to make us run faster. And i'm thinking if you touch me again i will rip that noodle from your hand and strangle you with it! Yeah so while she's like noodle-raping/ savagely beating us i'm like wow what happened to the laws against child abuse... Yeah speaking of smacking people's asses. Today when i was getting my books out of my locker after 7th period this guy walks buy and like grabs/touches/you get the point and i just figured that he bumped into be. And then he turns around and goes "OH GOD I didn't mean to grab your ass!!!" and he like yells it. And me and christina like cracked up. It was pretty funny.

      it has come to my attention that i forgot to add these tidbits about ice skating: 1. When we were skating before Suzie came, Laurel wanted to get off so she fell on purpose, 2. When we were eating, laurel does the little "roar" motion with her hand but says "word" tres amusant. Yeah. woot. Good times. Yeah so anyway, yesterday my dad got back from arizona and gave me these nifty earings. Yeah and then he showed us all these pictures from this college thing that frank lloyd wright started. It was coolish. He was all you should go there. And i'm like yeah and live in the middle of a dessert for four years to study architecture which i have absolutely no intrest in, especially Frank Lloyd Wright's stuff. He had a few good things, like Falling Water. But yeah thats about it. Anyway he went on for a millenia about that. And then he's like yeah well i have to get a new computer from the company. And i'm like can i have your old one and he was all "no it belongs to the company" a crushing disappointment, because if i got the computer i would never have to come down here and have people constantly looking over my shoulder. I could be up in privacy in my room on my montrousity of a bed.

      wow so i went ice skating today with laurel and anna and nora and suzie. It was great. Yeah so me and laurel and anna are standing around waiting for nora and suzie and there are all these sticky gooey things hanging from the ceiling and we're like wow, ew. And then we couldn't remember what hockey sticks were called so we're like "hockey clubs? no thats golf..." So then the others got there and we skated for a bit then we went and got food, because we were hungry. So we're eating our ice cream (go figure) and we're having this conversation about common sense. Don't ask. So like everytime anna says something laurel goes "common sense anna!" it was good. Yeah and then laurel looks up at one of the TVs and goes "look they're playing hockey! Oh wait that's football" and we're all like laughing hysterically. And anna goes "common sense laurel. No, don't let the big green field fool you, its really hockey." And then anna is eating her ice cream and she snaps her spoon. "Common sense anna" and then throwing it away she gets her hand stuck in the trash can and "suffered major injuries." And then Laurel's like "I'm not gonna finish my ice cream, I'll just stick it in my pocket" A brilliant plan of course. Yeah so then while we were skating more these little kids with ice walkers like cornered me and tried to run me over I was like AAAHHHH!!! but then i speed skated and ran away. So then we're skating around some more and me and laurel are talking and i go "so laurel have you fallen yet?" and right as i say that i fall flat on my ass. It was very three stooges. My feet like flew up into the air. Anna said when we were in the car driving home "I saw you fall, well not all of you i just saw this skate fly up into the air and then i turned around and your like 'ow'" yeah good times. So yeah then we skated for a bit more. PS my ass still hurts. Yeah then we were gonna sit on the side for a minute so we're like skating towards the wall and anna's in front of me slowing down and I can't stop and i'm like AAHHH MOVE so i run into anna and we both run into the wall. And then Laurel comes and crashes into the wall and she's like "SHIT THE ICE CREAM" and its like leaking all in her jacket cus she broke the container. So we go back up to the snack bar to eat the rest of the ice cream and clean out her pocket. Yeah then we bought water. Then went skating more and we're like "ok we're not gonna stop anymore till we have to go home" which was fifteen  minutes from then. So we're skating around and my ankles were really starting to hurt. So we all went around one more time then got off. Laurel got off before me and had her face and hands up against the window facing me so i was gonna skate up and crash into the window right where she was standing, unfortunately i tripped and went like flying towards the glass and fell right in front of the wall. We both died laughing. I wish laurel had had a camera. Yeah so then we were waiting outside and suzie was going to take a picture of laurel so laurel throws her arms back (water bottle in hand) and hits anna in the face. And anna's all "what the hell was that!" she thought she had run into the wall. It was hillarious. Good times good times...

      wow in art class	we were doing a critique and i kept thinking "wow i bet that was really funny when madeline randomly laughed" and i spent the next 45 minutes trying not to burst out laughing. It was horrible. I probably looked like an insane mongoose. Yeah but then when i presented my project he's like "i love this project, its amazing" and i'm like "please stop hitting on me"

I feel so happy and angry ,  nobody understands my feline , purple pain ,  I want to fly and run in the rain  the tree reminds me of feeling angry , the squirrels mock my enthusiasm ,   sometimes i want to stab my foot and die,  underneath the tall , small sky    make your own bad poem @  urlLink mewing.net">mewing.net

      behold my mewlib (like a madlib only "ew" instead of "ad"):   Once upon a time in the vast and rural land of london there was a little boy named bob who was 47 years old. bob had a emu named corey and together they enjoyed barking and jumping.   One day, bob and corey were taking a stroll through london, when they came across a round, purple pen. bob and corey were very happy and they insanely chopped away. But, the pen chopped after them.   At the advanced age of 47, bob was a very small boy and thus he knew what had to be done. He pulled his trusty piano from his pocket and screamed whoa!, eat pen-pussy!!!!! The pen sadly laughed into the distance, and bob and his emu happily went home to enjoy an afternoon of barking and jumping.    make your own mewlib @  urlLink mewing.net">mewing.net

      omg, so i picked my sister up from school today, and there is this little kid in like fifth grade, god he's amazing he's like two foot one. i'm like i love you. I was gonna say hi (cuz he walks the same way home we do) but i got nervous and chickened out. tomorrow. I will talk to him tomorrow. I'll be like "hi! kid!" he kinda looks like ben savage (corey from boy meets world) when he was like five or something. only he's not five, he's like ten. what an amazing little kid. He was carrying this poster board and it was like twice his size.

      so yesterday mum came up to me and she says "allie i want to play in the snow, come make a snowman with me" and i'm like "ok" so we go outside in the back yard and we start making a snowman. But it was to hard to make it a man so we gave it a skirt. And i'm like "oh mom lets make it a transvesite and we can name it cher!" and she goes "no, i don't want 'new york city night life'" and i was like "psht fine" so then i'm like "well we should give her a name" and mum's like "lets name her rosemary raisin because her face is made with raisins and her arms and hair are rosemary twigs" (i know i know, rosemary raisin...) and i'm like "well can we at least make her middle name cher" so rosemary  CHER  raisin was born. well sort of, because no matter what mum says it is still the transvestite snowman named cher.

It was weird there was more to the dream but thats the only part i can remember. The whole Charmed theme is kinda random to because i haven't watched that show in like a year. hmmm.

      so yesterday me and madeline walked to paul's house. Madeline got burried by a snow plow when we stopped for a rest. That was funny. Snow is cold. Yeah so then we went back to her house and watched part of Bridget Jone's Diary. Yeah when i had to leave madeline keeps going "only ten more minutes left" only she said that like every five minutes. Good times. Oh right i have to remember this when we were walking up to paul's house i go "maybe we'll see him shoveling his driveway" and madeline goes "without his shirt on!" good times! yeah so then today i spent the entire morning watching "the wiggles" excellent show.

      so i went to the mall with laurel. It was amazing. We tried on all these dresses and we picked our formal dresses. We match. yay. Then we went to claires and we bought little giraffe's and these best friend necklaces that are cheerleaders. They're pink and they're like amazing. I'm the "F" score. So then we went to get pizza. We were upstairs at Scotto's and we were sitting at this bench and i'm like laurel throw a piece of cheese over the railing. It hit this kid right on the head and then like bounced off it was amazing. So then we went to go get ice cream and we saw this old guy with a cane that had a horse head on it and it was all like fancy and he had a long beard and a black Indiana Jones-style hat with two red feathers. He was so cool! we stalked him and called him Texas Johnson (like Indiana Jones only not). The indiana jones movies are about him when he was young. And he lives in a mansion and he also lives in the sahara, cuz he's cool like that. Yeah so i looked away for like two seconds and he was gone. I'm a disgrace to stalkerdom. Yeah so then me and laurel were waiting for my mum to show up and we went on those little kid things that bounce up and down. That damn ice cream truck wouldn't work. Psht. Then i had this temporary addiction to those claw machines. It was bad. But then we left and Laurel lent me The Bell Jar, so I can finish it. That was basicly it. Yeah.

Well i hate dark chocolate so i just put a hole in the outside and sucked the raspberry stuff out. It was good haha. Then i put on a dinosaur tattoo that my sis gave me while i watched like ten minutes of "Roxanne" good movie

Let's see what was it this time... ah yes we were listening to a cd i made and he said "who is this" and i go "lifehouse, it's breathing" and he goes "oh i thought it was someone doing a cover of a Tori Amos song" i'm like "um, no. The piano would be more prominent, and the lyrics would be a million times more insightful." his response "oh i guess the way teenagers think today is that they have to correct everyones opinions" THANK  YOU COMMANDER ARROGANT because it's not like anytime i open my mouth he corrects me, even if i say something like "i like cheese." it seems like you couldn't correct that statement but OH NO he finds away. ok i'm done ranting for now *breathe breathe*

      so I've realized that both Bobby and Kelly are in the library, but not together. I wonder if they know the other one is there. I'd say something but, well it's just too fun watching them continue to miss eachother. ps. kelly don't kill me when you read this if you didn't realize he was there.

      ok i am saying this once and for all, i will NOT take my hair down. When it's down it looks either a.) extremely eighties b.) extremely country pop star c.) peg bundy-esk d.) fairly seventies or e.) a mixture of the four, which is the worst of all. My hair is not coming out of my ponytail until it grows at least three inches. I'm sorry (well no not really) but you'll just have to deal with not seeing it and trust me that if you saw it you might freeze into stone. And i swear to god if one more person asks/orders me (which i think is quite rude) to take my hair down i swear to god i will eat their eyeballs. Also i would like to officially apologize to Madeline for gang raping her and trying to get her hair down, looks like karma has finally come to get me. And we all know what i say about karma, it's a bitch.

      Cry- Faith Hill if I had just one tear  running down your cheek maybe I could cope  maybe i'd get some sleep.  ifI had just one moment at your expense  maybe all my misery would be well spent.  could you cry a little lie just a little pretend that youre feeling a little more pain.  I gave, now im wanting something in return  so cry just a little for me.  if your love could be caged honey, I would hold the key.  and conceal it underneath  that pile of lies you handed me.  and you'd hunt and those lies  they'd be all you'd ever find.  and that'd be all you'd have to know  for me to be fine.  and you'd cry a little you'd die just a little and baby I would feel just a little less pain.  I gave now from wanting  something in return so cry just a little for me.  give it up baby I hear youre doin fine.  nothins gonna save me I see it in your eyes.  some kind of heartache  honey give it a try.  I don't want pity,  I just want what is mine

         yeah so i got my hair cut. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems that this hair cut just SCREAMS "thank you very much for the country music award." I would also like to add that it went down about two inches in the time it took me to get home. The hairdresser was like "do you want hairspray in it" i was like "LIKE HELL I DO" she like curled it or something to hugen it, after i post this i will immediately be washing my hair and ridding it of the scariness. When she first like showed me what she did, i looked exactly like peg bundy, i kid you not. PLEASE let washing my hair take out the bigness/mulletiness (which it looks like now that i tried to straighten it)/peg bundy-eskness.

Yay! ok so that library woman that looks like she is dead (ya know she has the make up that they put on corpses for the viewing) came by and she was just staring at me and mallory staring at us desperately trying to find something we were doing wrong. She finally realized that we had a krackle bar and she goes "put the food away this is a library not a cafeteria" fortunately we had already finished it. Yay. we triumph over the administration once again. allie- 1 administration -0 ba ha ha ha. ok i'm done now. tehehe.

      yay super sunday. good lord this morning i wanted to smack every member of my family. i was awake for like five minutes and my mom like conned/guilted me into taking my sister to super sunday, and then by the time i was awake she had already left for the book sale so i couldn't be like "yeah mom, me takin' gio, well it just ain't happenin'" so then i told gio that and she's like "eehhhhh *fake crying*" and i'm like "gio, i already made plans with madeline and i don't want to have to censor my conversation with her because you're around, plus honestly you would be bored out of your mind because there is no possible way you could participate in the conversation. You wouldn't know what we were talking about. And don't give me that 'don't exclude me' crap because if one of your friends come over if i ask you if i can borrow a hair thing it's all ALLIE GET OUT OF HERE GOD! *more fake crying*" so then she shut up. And then mom gets home and gio makes it seem like i'm not going at all (as in that's what she told mum while i was in the shower) and then mom's talking to me and i'm like um no i'm going with madeline, and then she gives me this "i'm dissapointed in you" look. And dad's like "you're just going to blow your sister off" and i'm like "yeah so i'm the bad guy because you guys guilted me into taking her and you're pissed because i don't want to" and then dad said something like "yeah well then we'll see who is gonna come and visit you in the hospital when you have a stroke or something" and mom had to physically hold me back. god he pisses me off so much. And i would have said something like "who the fuck are you to judge, i'm doing a hell of a lot better now than you were at my age" (because he was a pot head through high school and college) but i really NEEDED to get out of the house and i figured something like that would get me grounded. So i silenced myself. But god i am so happy i'm going out somewhere. I can't stand being around them all the time. ah, god bless super sunday. Mom was like "don't stay there too long" and i'm like "yeah whatever" i.e. um, i don't think so mother.

      dude, i just found this girls blog. It's amazing. She's annoying as hell and i would never talk to her, but her blog is amazin, at least to me. She's like "yeah this girl cam up to me and was like let's have sex but i was all i don't flow that way" and then like a few weeks later she's like "i make out with girls for fun" and then she's like "i'm in love with paras (i.e. some girl) she gave me a hickey, my parents didn't flip. I love you paras!" it's intense. It's like a really shitty student film, in blog format.  urlLink Moe's Blog

      this morning me, klp, christina and puddin' pop were all standing outside chiara's locker waiting for paul. and i was standing on one side and the others were facing me then i notice that he is coming so madeline shoves puddin' and christina over next to me so we're all facing madeline and madeline is facing paul, and we're all like squished up against the locker, because um... we're lesbians like that. And we're like laughing hysterically of course, because well, you read it you know it was funny. And Paul walks by and looks back at us and has this like terrified/shocked look on his face, it was priceless. Then madeline's like "pull it together guys, that dave kid is gonna think we're crazy" and i'm like "who's dave" and she's like "he's right there, DAVE" and i turn around and i'm like "his name is DAN, madeline.. dan" it was amazing.

      went on that pottery field trip today. I spent the entire time having mad crazy cool fun (in a non-dirty way.... most of the time) with Kacie and Pat (yeah i know i wasn't too happy about that part either) It was hilarious. We spent like the entire trip making crude sex jokes. That's the only way to go. Like we saw this display with like a woman bending down making something or whatever and this other person standing up on the other side of the display like i dunno standing there, and then this random goat. It was amazing. And i'm like, it would be so easy to rearange those people to make it sex-oriented. And pat's like "yeah just put the standing person behind that other woman" and i'm like "don't forget the goat!" It was amazing. It was hilarious. And then we are all looking at this mummy thing and like this fat kid thing comes up and it's like "can you please move so I can see" and then it's chaparone (sp?) thing was like "michael you could have just come around on this side" and we're all like "I thought it was a girl!" And we're like well maybe it's like that guy on Gilmore Girls, Michelle. Only it's a girl and it's name it Michael. So we called it Michelle from then on. Good stuff. Then we saw the greek exhibit and there was this statue with a little carving thing on the front which was a dick with like wings or something. It was so bizarre. It even said on the little card thing on the side that it was "male genitalia" we're like "horny bastards" We also talked a while about how Mr. Samilenko was sad and when he was talking about water hardness he said "I like it hard in the shower" or something like that that gave the same effect. I carried my water bottle from lunch around for a while but then i didn't feel like it holding it anymore so i was like "pat be useful hold my water for me" i didn't think he would acutally do it, but he did. He put it in his pocket and I'm like "ew, I don't want your pocket water!"We laughed for days. good times. Also Mutter museum, very icky. Things in jars. Eye's with toothpicks in them. LOTS of siamese twins.

      omg speaking of things that can be easily inuendo-ized, in science today, god everything he said had a double meaning... hardness, some people like it hard (talking about water hardness), then he went on a rant about taking showers with different levels of hardness in the water, that almost killed me. no one else seemed to be forcing themselves to keep a straight face though, I must just have a dirty mind. yes that's probably it.

      so there is this pottery field trip tomorrow to the mutter museum (dead things in jars) and the philidelphia museum of anthapology (old stuff on pedestals) should be pretty ok. Considering I'm missing spanish, la, gs, gym, and half of math, I think it'll be great, EXCEPT pat said he is turning in his permission slip tomorrow so he can go. please let him forget, please let him forget, please let him forget. If I have to spend an entire day with that fucker, well one of us may not come back alive, while allie laughs.

      ok it is taking me and insanely long time to type up the travel blog so i'll just explain the whole hospital thing now. we were in bradford, dad and his mom (i.e. my mom-mom) were supposed to come up on saturday. BUT she had an attack of lupus (which we didn't even know she had) she's in ICU so we came home early to see her. I went to see her yesterday. I was so hard to see her hooked up to all those machines, she didn't even recognize me. I started crying. I felt really stupid. and i didn't want anyone to see me like that because then i would like take the attention, and it wasn't about me. um, Also yesterday we were at my aunt mary's before visiting hours at the hospital, mum thought I should participate with my cousins so she forced me to play basketball outside with them.. in a skirt... and flip flops... and an absolute hatred for basketball, needless to say i fell (because some midget from next door like head butted me) scraped up my legs, and the slit in my skirt miraculously  extended itself to a tres inapropriate length. yes thank you mother.

Anna just laughed at us incessantly, but even caked in doughnut some random black guys outside dunkin' donuts hit on us. They were like "look at you lookin' like an angel, mmhmm" we're like "walk faster!" good times, good times, also me and anna stayed up until 3 o'clock watching hot foreign guys...

      so me and madeline went to the park, with all her dogs. But we didn't put leads on them, so they were just kind of running around. And cloe (chloe? i don't know they both look wrong) was like on the other side of the pond, and we're just like, yeah whatever she knows where we are. And then this guy and his dog were like walking by and the dogs like run at his dog and like cloe tries to attack it. And we spent like ten minutes trying to give the guy his dog back, and then like two minutes (not even) later the same thing happens, and all the dogs are wet from the last scuffle (because it took place near/in the streamlet) and we're like trying to get the zorro and g on the leads but g wasn't wearing a collar so madeline goes "just put the loop around her neck" as she's like holding her out away from her. And then g just like squirms out of it, runs two feet and sits next to a tree. Then that guys dog was like chasing her so i run up and get her and the dog is like jumping on me trying to sniff g's ass. And then cloe runs away and i run and get her while the dog is like leaping on me meanwhile madeline is trying to control zorro and g and the guy's dog (who had run back her direction) and then she grabs hold of the guy's dog and it's like running around her trying to sniff zorro and like madeline's like spinning with the dog meanwhile the guy is like trying to grab his dog and like he had to like hug madeline's legs to reach it. It was amazing. And we were like cracking up the whole time. Maybe you had to be there for it to be funny.But the best part was that this time we got to be the weirdos at the park, it's usually the other way around.

I SHOULD work on it now since i'll have nothing to do all study hall.. but HEY why would i wanna do that right... right. ew i'm having such a fuck ass day. like seriously i am just GAH i am soooooo glad today is friday and i don't have to comeback for like another week and a day. yay. oh and yeah why the hell does it have to keep raining. i mean i love rain. a lot. but everytime it rains that mean people (aka person) i hate comes home on my bus and harrasses me incessantly. It was great when said person had "laryngitis" (sp?) but now person is back. GOD and i was hoping weeks of bedrest would cause his muscles to atraphy, so he would be paralyzed for life... never bothering  me again. sigh, but it was only a dream.

      i have recently been informed that next wednesday we are leaving to go to bradford, and not coming back till monday. I won't have access to a computer during this time, so my plan is to make a bradford journal, where i will document all the horrors i see, plus i'll probably add some amusing drawings. I will add a page or something to my blog where you can read it, and pity me. Maybe i'll just have a little log off to the side for whenever i don't have access to blogger. good god someone help me. i don't want to spend six days at wallmart! oh god.... six days.... god save me...

It's really creepy up here, they should really try and lighten the place up with like some.... lamps... updates as things happen. which probably won't be that often.

Sigh, c'est la vie. I really should do my pottery worksheet, considering i have it next period, yeah i'll get to that now.

      from a Kevin James stand-up routine on buying impromtu cards for girlfriends.... "If you buy a card for a woman, she's gonna think you planned it when really you just bought when you went to get some milk or something and like signed it at a red light. Just remember don't leave the receipt in the car, it's evidence. You never know, you might be in the car two minutes later and its 'You got this card  five  minutes ago! And you bought a butterfinger first you FATASS!'"  one word... genius

They were like "don't judge people by what they look like, but here are some pictures of people, judge them on what they look like" They were like forcing us to judge people just so they could tell us not to. and p.s. Ms. Evans has a fifteen foot pole up her ass, which is impressive considering she is three foot tall potato woman/nazi

      ok so last period SPUR OF THE MOMENT (yes i'm using old people slang) Ms. Breslin decides HEY LET'S MAKE ALLIE THE BRIDE OF OUR INDIAN WEDDING. (sure we did three weddings that period, one was with people who volunteered BECKY SMITH AND MATT GREENBLATT, eeewwww) yeah so anyway, she picked me because she said i was "avoiding looking at her" which i suppose it true but not quite. I always avoid looking at her. stupid cow. i mean.... no. that's right. yeah, have decided to hate breslin. So she's like "yay fuck you allie" and i married shane carlson. admittedly, could have been worse. And cheryl and hannah wrapped my sari a SMIDGE too tight. yeah. that hurt. It was really funny though because at the part where i had to feed him the rice i was just like "fick this, EAT IT YOURSELF" only less dramatic. I just like handed him the container and the fork, and was like "EAT IT" everyone laughed. Good times. no scratch that. Meh times. Or perhaps embarressing times. That kinda works. p.s. i want a sari, those things are amazing. But at least she didn't take pictures like Mr. Nolen did. BAHA MADELINE. p.p.s. if anyone wants to see Madeline's wedding check out Mr. Nolens room. It's the first room on the right in A-wing (BAHA MADELINE...again.)

      alright. Here's the plan.   The Plan:  I will take the car keys out of mum's purse (for the eggmobile of course, no one will miss it.) Then I will strategically slip out the office window, and land gracefully on the lawn outside. Then stealthily hijack (hyjack?) the eggmobile and drive to Mexico. Occasionally stopping for bathroom breaks and perhaps a Frappuccino or two. Then when I get to Mexico I will use my insane Spanish skills and open a restaurant called "Bailando Frida's" ("Dancing Frida's" for all those non-spanish speakers out there.) I will become an instant success and live happily ever after in a huge house with Ricardo, the latino waiter who I started my business with, forever free of boredom.

      so PAINFULLY bored, i have done absolutely nothing today. I woke up at 10:30 (sad, i know) read for a while, played all the tunes on my sister's keyboard (mostly Crocodile Rock and Killing Me Softly With His Song) then watched disney channel, then popped in Emma (which i rented from the library) then watched meaningless hours of television. After my brain was sufficiently fried i turned the tv off, only to hear my sister "playing" the keyboard. So now here I am. A sad state. Oh also fit in there an attempt to discover my hidden talents as a pianist. I guess those talents are a twinge more hidden than I thought.

And the guy goes "well leave out a bowl of anti-freeze in your lawn. Dogs and cats love, cuz they think it tastes sweet. And then they die. It's a really slow painful death, cuz you can hear them howling all night." and my dad said he was just thinkin' "how do you know this...?" wow. that is insanely hilarious in a "please stay away from my family" kinda way.

      wow I haven't written in a while, i.e. a day. Um I'm a little disturbed that my posts aren't showing up in the little screen below. Oh well. I'm sure it's fine *boom/spontaneous combustion* I just put two pictures on mal's blog through my HTML genius. yes. or not whatever. Ok so we had this little like health lecture whatsit yesterday about like sex and marraige. Of course we (the girls) get the, "You'll get pregnant you ignorant slut" speach. While the guys get the "um yeah whatever man, just don't...i don't care really..." speach. Yeah this woman was like "ok close your eyes and imagine that your walking into a room with the guy of your dreams, the room is great, it has anything you'll ever need, this room is marraige. Now you walk into the room and the door vanishes behind you, you have no way out. what are your thoughts." PRISON! wow really sellin' it there hun. yeah the whole time she's like "marraige is great, but it sucks ass" the whole feeling i got from her was like cynical bitterness. haha. yeah well. Um really nothing else interesting is happenin' only 19 days of school left i think. 19 or 20 ish. thank GOD. oh right yesterday I started on the pottery wheel and like got clay ALL over my legs, it was insane. Also i managed to um not make anything on the wheel despite my desperate attempts, it was just terrible. haha, all good fun though.

      43%  Mutant Wannabe! Well, we've got good news and bad news. The good news is that you've definitely got some latent mutant powers. The bad news is that if you didn't have experts like us on the case, you'd never even know it. Your mutant potential needs to be developed, coaxed out like the last drop of toothpaste from the very bottom of the tube. Keep doing your thing, and one day that mutant ability just might show itself. If not, might we suggest attending a fine institution like the Xavier School for Gifted Students. We hear their biology department is excellent.

      yay i didn't go to school today! mom dragged me to some random museum in brandywine today cuz she felt guilty about me using the independent study day without actually doing anything educational. She woke me up at like 7:30 to do that. I'm like "mother, do you not get the concept of sleeping in!" well actually it was more like *grunt* Yeah, so we walk in the door of the museum and the first thing we see is a giant crotch eye-level. It was like part of a big poster of a painting of some ballet guy. I'm like "i'll take that as a sign for the quality of the day that is ahead of me" yeah so we spent a thousand years there then came home, and went to go see gio's play. It was soooo cute. omg little people rock. It was the sound of music and there were all these like little nazis running around. Priceless.

      yesterday i went to see lizzie mcguire and went to the mall with madeline good times. I don't feel like putting all the amazingness in complete sentences, too much. so here is a list of the highlights... 1. waiting in line to buy tickets the 500 year old woman cut in front of us 2. in the movie, well, just wow. It was the worst plot and the worst italian accents i have ever heard. And yet it was amazing and we are officially obsessed with lizzie 3. after the movie we went to the mall in search of lizzie merchandise, we found blonde hair extensions in claires, very tempted to buy. 4. we saw this guy trying to break up with this girl so we ran up the stairs to stare at them, we watched them for like ten minutes and then we turn around for like three seconds and they were gone. psht, just are luck. She probably smacked him too. I bet she cried. i feel so deprived. 5. walked around for a while and then got our pictures taken in one of those photo booths and it says "i love you" across the top and our pictures are in a big heart, amazing. 6. This little kid was standing outside the booth he was like four, we tried to get him to get in the picture with us, but sigh, he didn't 7. while the picture was printing we realized that there was a tv on top of the booth that allowed everyone passing by to see us and our picture that said "i love you" at the top, if people didn't think we were lesbians before that, they do now. we almost pissed ourselves laughing. 8. then we went to cvs to get a marker to add lizzie to the bottom of our picture so it reads "I love you, Lizzie" sadly there was no such marker that was not prepackaged so we could use it without actually purchasing it. 9. we went to this furnature store and pretended to be lesbians picking out new furnature for our apartment to match our new lizzie design. 10. this kid hit me in the back with some like bizzare toy. Madeline seems convinced he was aiming for my ass. Horny ten year old. 11. we chased those two kids they seems rather scared. Especially the fat one. We were going to show them our lesbian picture, but they ran to their parents 12. went to get water ice but then ran away because ed hlosjakhdfkjlhas was there. We passed ritas and i was like "just be casual blend in he won't see us" then i rammed into some random woman. It was funny. 13. then we got ritas and went home. all in all a good day. we must have lost a million callories or more laughing. ah ha.

Hope i get the lyrics right... part of "superhero" by Stephen Lynch ...if i could be a superhero would you be justice guy make sure people get what they deserve, especially women who lie like a wife who leaves her husband with three kids and no job  to run off to f-ing hawaii with some doctor named bob i'd skin them and let them bleed till they die especially bob because i would be justice guy you could be subtle, no i didn't mean to be vague give her the mad cow disease let him die of the plague and then they'd pay for their terrible lie especially bob and then you would be a super hero, like me  god what a guy, he is just hillarious.

        You are the Marquis Da Sade. Even stripped of exaggerations, Your real life was as dramatic and as tragic as a cautionary tale. Born to an ancient and noble house, you were married (against your wishes) to a middle-class heiress for money, caused scandals with prostitutes and with your sister-in-law, thus enraging your mother-in-law, who had you imprisoned under a lettre de cachet for 14 years until the Revolution freed you. Amphibian, protean, charming, you became a Revolutionary, miraculously escaping the guillotine during the Terror, only to be arrested later for publishing your erotic novels. You spent your final 12 years in the insane asylum at Charenton, where you caused another scandal by directing plays using inmates and professional actors. You died there in 1814, virtually in the arms of your teenage mistress. You are a revolutionary deviant. I applaud you.    urlLink   Which Imfamous criminal are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Ok, for some reason I have been obsessing about those stupid health talks. That whole thing just bothered me. So now, right here, I am going to list all the things that were just wrong and biased with that whole thing. I should have stood up and said all this stuff at the talks, but I didn't think to do it. Luckily I have a blog. Tehehe. 1. That whole thing about "nowadays everyone builds their marriages on unsturdy foundations and that's why they get divorced. It used to be that people would get married and stay together" Yes, people did stay together fifty years ago, but that wasn't because of solid foundations, that was because if they got divorced, no matter how miserable they were, they would become somewhat of an outcast of society. Today people can get divorced without being shunned. 2. What was that crap about "being pure." Like that guy who proposed and gave her a diamond and said "this is how pure I think you are." What the hell kind of proposal is that. I would beat the hell out of any man that EVER used the word "pure" to compliment or insult me. That is just so condisending, like "Well I'm a virgin and you're not and I'm really too good for you, but I want to be with you anyway." And also, that guy was supposedly a genius; he got his master's degree in four and a half years, BUT he proposed to a girl who is a sophmore in college and is dropping out to get married. What the hell are they going to talk about? And she is going to hate him by the time she has their first child because she never got an education, and since she didn't get an education she can't get a good job, she is going to be a house wife, with NO life. That marriage just has "doomed" written all over it. 3. The guys did NOT get the same talk. They didn't get that "sex is emotional" speach. If the goal was to educate both genders and not to make the girls look like whores. Why exactly is it always on the women to be virgins?  ok. I've said my piece.

      anna's here. We're going to eat lots of junk food and watch movies all night. We kinda got a head start on the eating part... bahaha. My sister's little friends tried to kill us. They were like "it's funny that you're choking to death" stupid fuckers. I hate small children. Thus my job as a camp counselor for 1st graders... p.s. Anna's husband is leaking air.

      ok haven't been able to post for a while, i.e. i'm a bum and i didn't feel like it. Ok so this is the new blogger. looks... about the same. So for the past three days i have been working at the camp and it is official... i will kill them ALL. small children are so annoying.. and clingy. And the relatives left this morning. Omg yesterday me and my family went to fellini's and my uncle, upon seeing us getting some of our meals wrapped up, says, AND I QUOTE, "ya gatta eat hard" ok there are three things i would like to say about that. 1) gramatically speaking, i'm not even sure that is a sentence 2) that doesn't make any sense 3) so we're supposed to follow YOUR dietary plan, Fatty McButterball.

      oh...my...FUCKING...god. Ok so yesterday I was thinking "hey on monday, I'll buy a bathing suit, go to the pool. Hang out. It'll be great. It'll be my last day of vacation besides weekend until I leave for bradford, since I'm starting working on the camp on tuesday" but NO! at ten A- EFFING- M the director calls from our library saying "hi is allie there- oh hi dear- could you come in this morning and work till about two, we're a little short handed. I hope I didn't wake you up - oh sorry dear. I feel really aweful about making you work on you're first day of vacation, especially since you worked all weekend. Ok well see you at 11" *hangs up* at which point I screamed "SON OF A BITCH" There is only one explanation for this happening... it's some kind of cruel joke that the universe is playing on me. Only possible excuse.

      ok I spent all yesterday watched stand-up comedy. It. Was. HEAVEN. I saw this Lewis Black Comedy Central Presents. He is officially the funniest man EVER. he was just... omg. It was just amazing. Ok here's a quote... "candy corn. What's that about? It's corn... that tastes like candy. I remember the first time my mom gave me candy corn. 'here lewis. It's corn, but it tastes like candy.' I can remember thinking. Hey that sounds great. So I eat it. And I'm like 'THIS IS CRAP!' but every holloween since then I have eaten candy corn. It's like I get alzheimer's (sp?). Every year I see a bowl of candy corn sitting on the table and I think 'Hmm... corn that tastes like candy.' *eats* 'SON OF A BITCH'" see what did i tell you. GENIUS.

      god bless stand-up comedy.. ok here are two amazing quotes i just heard... *do you know what happens when the baby won't come out? They cut you, and not on your knee either. On a very stratigic spot. A spot that if you cut a man there in the same spot, there would be a homocide. Or a suicide. Nobody would leave that room alive. Tiny bundle of joy, NOT TONIGHT! and... *you always hear about dead-beat dads, but what about the kids who don't deserve the child support.

      amazing quotes i can remember off the top of my head from Casablanca.. "I like to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me." "I'm shocked, shocked to find gambling going on in here." "Sir, you're winning" "Thank You." "We're so excited. We'll be there at six." "yes, I'll be there at ten." "Here's looking at you, kid." "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." "What's your nationality?" "I'm a drunkard" "If you don't get on that plane you'll regret it. Maybe not today, but tomorrow and for the rest of your life." "Round up the usual suspects."

      ok so today me and my sister and dad went to get Rita's and in front of us in line was my boss's boss Kristen and her scary son (1st grade) and behind us was my sister's ungodly annoying/spoiled/conceited friend Olivia. My sister talked to Olivia, and Kristen talked to me, while her son stared at my crotch and said "THREE BUTTON PANTS" and hit his head against the wall. It was a bit disturbing. it was really funny a while ago when kristen and me were working she was talking to me about how she like took no classes in her senior year and just like screwed around the whole year. And i'm thinking "wow, that could be cool maybe i'll do that instead of taking all those ap courses and stuff, she turned out ok." but THEN i thought "wait a minute, no she didn't. She's like forty she works at a library. Her son is a maniac/has his mother WRAPPED, and her skin absolutely SCREAMS 'SUN DAMAGE! SMOKER!'" yeah. it was funny.

In a "hey i know you and i'm gonna wave hello" kinda way. I only saw one of the people cuz they were driving pretty fast and like i didn't recognize him at all so i was like.. maybe there was someone in the car i was supposed to know.

       Sam Stone  by John Prine Sam Stone came home to his wife and family after serving in the conflict overseas and the time that he served had shattered all his nerves and left a little shrapnel in his knee but the morphine eased the pain and the grass grew 'round his brain and gave him all the confidence he lacked with a purple heart and a monkey on his back  chorus  there's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes and jesus christ died for nothing i suppose little pitchers have big ears don't stop to count the years sweet songs never last too long on broken radios  sam stone's welcome home didn't last too longhe went to work when he's spent his last dime and sammy took to stealing when he got the empty feeling for a hundred dollar habit, without overtime and the gold rolled thru his veins and eased his mind in the hourse that he chose while the kids ran around wearing other people's clothes  repeat chorus  sam stone was alone when he popped his last balloon climbing walls while sitting in a chair well, he played his last request while the room smelled just like death with an overdose hovering the air but life had lost its fun and there was nothing to be done but trade his house that he bought on the G.I. Bill for a flag draped casket on a local heroes' hill  repeat chorus

      stupid library... so boring. except for when that UNGODLY hot guy came in. That was amazing. I kept making excuses to go over and shelve things near him. sexy BEAST... i think he might have been a little frightened... I will say this though... I think that a library would be an excellent place to blatantly hit on someone... lots of bending.

      On Saturday I'm going to a wedding for some people I don't even know. I wanna go though, becuase then I get to wear my new polkadot dress. I'm staying at my aunt's apt. on friday because my parents are going to some other random wedding in cape may. And my sister is going to some sleep over thing. I would stay here alone, but we have no TV or air conditioning, and my aunt does. Hmmm tough descision I know. Speaking of our TV which was apparently MIA. Our TV broke like two weeks ago or something like that. So we gave to Boscov's to fix, they sent it to reading (which took like two weeks, even though Reading is only like an hour away) Then they lost it for a while. But good news now it's found and in Reading. I want my freaking TV back.

      ok so I have had to wake up early everyday for the past like week and half or so with working and then bike riding in OC. As anyone can tell you, morning is not my time of day. So last night I'm like "ok finally in way to long I have no reason to wake up early tomorrow. No work. No excercise. I'm gonna sleep till at least mid afternoon." but NO. I went to bed at like 10:30 (i was really tired) and I woke up at like 9:20. I freaking hate reality.

      Major announcement, Allie's blog readers (yes all two and a half of you out there)! Well two announcements, sorta. Except to anyone besides me they're really not major at all. First, am scrapping the Travel blog, as a) no one reads it and b) it's a pain in the ass to write in, Second, am adding an "Allie IS..." page. Where there will be several pictures of me as different people. As soon as I get this last roll of film developed. It is inspired by that "Allie IS Malibu Barbie" picture.

      oh dear GOD. I spent two and a half hours shelf reading today. For those of you out there who are fortunate enough to never have worked in a library, shelf reading is giong through shelves upon shelves making sure everthing is in order. It's like reading a phone book and making sure Jones comes before Miller. For two and a half hours. I was damn close to taking a flying leap out the window. But as it was only a first floor and I would probably only end up with a scraped knee, I decided against it.

Maybe I should bring something to read.

      YES IT'S FREAKING FRIDAY!!!!!! THANK FUCKING GOD!!!!! oh my god in camp today they had this little like talent show thingy, sad as that sounds it gets worse (or better depending on your view). This little kid Riley, who was like a transvestite last year, and still has drag queen qualities now, i.e. girls shirts, well anyway he did an act, and *breathes to keep from laughing hysterically* he sung that song from the lizzie mcguire movie (YES I SAW THAT EFFING MOVIE AND IT WAS AMAZING) ya know "hey now hey now, this is what dreams are made of" and he just repeated that over and over again. It was freaking amazing. If he wasn't such a brat he'd be my hero. This new counselor thinks that he's a girl. I choose not to correct her.

      freaking god. I am surrounded by small children. First there is camp. Then I come home and my friends loserish little friend is here. WHEN WILL IT END!! I got a tank top thing in camp today that I have to wear on like feild trips and stuff because.... we had money to blow? But yeah they gave them out like a few weeks ago, but since I wasn't there I didn't get one, and am therefor stuck with the large. I was already wearing a different shirt so I just put that one on top and I was sweating like a fucking whore in church. But then again, because that shirt is so big, if I hadn't been wearing that shirt underneath the whore reference would have been much more literal.

      oh my freaking god. I just got back from seeing Pirates of the Caribbean again with Madeline. Though it is still amazing, it also STILL has horrible acting. Seriously Orlando Bloom cannot act. He should stick to Lord of the Rings where is acting ranges from facial expressions of mildly amused to mildly interested. But this time I had Madeline to make fun of it with. *mini cheer* Johnny Depp is still the sexiest man on the freaking planet. Ok but then we get out of the movies and we are sitting outside on one of those little wall things and Madeline is like spitting ice and stuff, because... why not. And then my neighbor, Chrissie, walks by and is all "hey what's up" and i'm just like. "oh my god who the fuck was that." It took me about three minutes to remember who she was. Sad, I know. Sadder for her really though. Ok then, Madeline, in a fit of ice spittingness drips ice FROM HER MOUTH, all over her crotch. And then to get back at me for laughing so freaking hard she pours the remaining contents of her cup (ice water) on me. Attempting to pour it on my crotch to make people think I pissed myself. She missed and it went all over my leg. It was hilarious. I wasn't even moving or trying to block it or anything. Then we walk across the parking lot to the mall to get a pretzal at rita's. Madeline gets her pretzal and in an attempt to brush the salt off of it she drops it into the trash can. We laughed till we pissed ourselves. Then we get gelatis also at rita's. And then just as we were recovering from the pretzal incident this french guy (french madeline, not spanish, FRENCH) comes up and is like "alo, what are your names? Ow old ah yoo? Yoo ah frens? I see. You (madeline) come ere I weell show yoo somsing. *polishes madeline's thumbnail while we laugh our fucking asses off* Come now be serious ladies *laughs* *speaks incoherently in french accent*" We laughed so much like neither of us could say a word. We should have given him fake names. We could not breathe. I was like fucking pissing myself. amazing.

      I freaking hate small children. Ok camp sucked ass today. I don't feel like typing the whole story. Four main points.  One) I got pushed into a pool IN MY CLOTHES. It is really hard to swim while trying to hold your shirt down at the same time. Two) Small children MOLEST/RAPE you. Three) Steve is not freaking Jamaican!!!!! Four) I SMILE FREAKING ENOUGH, BRENT!!!!!!!!

But hey it's raining (or will be soon anyway) so I won't have to be outside because we'll all be at the community center, so I can just sit on a windowsill and tell people to stop running. yay. Hmmm. I should have left like ten minutes ago. Oh vell. Maybe mom will give me a ride.

      oh my god. Pirates of the Caribbean. I am officially in love with that movie. Must see again. Johnny Depp is my fucking hero. What a guy. Ya know he played the role of Captain Jack Sparrow (his character, obviously) to be like keith richards, you know half high all the time. I must say it is the most attractive thing I've seen in a long time. Mmmm and those gold teeth. What more could you ask for.

      I don't want to go to work tomorrow. It's hot, I have to wake up early, and there are small children (which I hate, with a PASSION). I don't know why I chose to be a camp counselor. Oh that's right, it pays well. Only two more weeks then it's over. Please let those weeks go by fast.

      oh my FUCKING god. Yesterday was that evil evil evil evil baseball game. Instead of my dad's friend bringing his wife he brought his satanic little daughter. When we went to pick them up at quarter of five I was forced into the backseat so Dad could talk to his friend. (that was pretty much the way it was the whole time, completely ignored me to talk to John. I'm like then why did you fucking guilt me into going in the first place.) I read the label on my bottled water twenty times, and that was just during the homerun derby. During the game I had to take Satan Jr. to the bathroom twice because her father apparently assumed I was her caretaker for the evening. And the second time it was like ten minutes after I had gone by myself and ASKED HER "do you wanna come with?" stupid ass monkey. I felt really bad for the people sitting next to us they had to get up like ten times throughout the game, just because of us. After the game, that went into the 11th fucking inning, little miss my-parents-have-spoiled-me-so-much-I-actually-believe-I-am-the-queen-of-the-world had a craving for a cheese steak. Yes, that's right a cheese steak, at 11 effing  PM . So we sat in this grease palace near drexel university for an HOUR (because the demoness took so fricking long to eat her steak) while I watched three people scarf down charred animal flesh on a roll. AKA I spent an hour wanting to puke my guts out. (for those of you who don't know, which you should if you know anything about me, I am a vegetarian) Then we dropped them off, were home by one, and I slept until 7:30 this morning when my sister woke me up because she wanted to open her birthday presents.

      wow, long time no post. If you check anna's blog we made a conjoint post a week and a few days ago, when we sneaked on to her dad's computer. I believe there is something about me insulting anna's typing skills. hahaha. Well it was a lovely two weeks in ocean city with anna's family. I went on Extreme Vilocity (sp?). It was amazing. I don't really feel like typing what it's all about. But it was insane. Maybe later I'll feel the urge to type a detailed description... or not. While I was gone our TV broke (will be in the shop for the next week, or more. Oh well, looks like I'll be reading/being online a lot) and we got DSL. Yay things are loading left and right. It's a real shock to me.

      wow... just got back from bradford. Ok it was a loooong drive. We left there at quarter of one. We got here at 8:30. That's a 7 hour and forty-five minute drive, that is usually 6 hours. That's a lot of traffic. Good lord. ok here are the things that should be noted from that trip. *spent entire trip up there reading Catch-22 and listening to music (i didn't finish the book which was my goal but hey) *when we got there my uncle mario was wearing no shirt, and he is neither a thin man nor an unhairy man (he did this for three days straight and refused to wear a shirt even at meals, i almost puked) *bought numerous items at the Walmart, including flip-flops for $4.85. They're squishy. *at the family reunion I'm pretty sure that everyone thought me and my cousin were people that wandered off the street because we smelled food. Which might as well be true because we didn't talk to anyone and stole the candy from the little kids when they broke open the pinata. *also at the family reunion aunt angie thought my dad was tim and congradulated him on his new grandchild. I was later confronted and told I've been hiding stuff from the family *family reunion= bocci ball and illegal fireworks *I found out that my psychotic uncle john bought a piece of property SOLEY to put a BOCCI BALL COURT on it. yes. I'm not even kidding. *ungodly long drive home *at a unimart i bought one of those cheap "jelly watches" that are like digital pieces of crap. They are the Swatches of the 21st century. It's hot pink.

      Fever (words & music by John Davenport - Eddie Coole) Never know how much I love you Never know how much I care When you put your arms around me I get a fever that's so hard to bear You give me fever when you kiss me Fever when you hold me tight Fever in the morning Fever all through the night. Ev'rybody's got the fever that is something you all know Fever isn't such a new thing Fever started long ago Sun lights up the daytime Moon lights up the night I light up when you call my name And you know I'm gonna treat you right You give me fever when you kiss me Fever when you hold me tight Fever in the morning Fever all through the night Romeo loved Juliet Juliet she felt the same When he put his arms around her He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth Fever with the flaming youth Fever I'm afire Fever yea I burn for sooth' Captain Smith and Pocahantas Had a very mad affair When her daddy tried to kill him She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare He gives me fever with his kisses Fever when he holds me tight Fever, I'm his misses, Oh daddy, won't you treat him right' Now you've listened to my story Here's the point that I have made Cats were born to give chicks fever Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade They give you fever when you kiss them Fever if you live and learn Fever till you sizzle What a lovely way to burn What a lovely way to burn What a lovely way to burn

      I watched "What A Girl Wants" yesterday. You know that movie with Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth (the only reason I watched the movie in the first place). It actually wasn't that bad. Like if you were in the mood to not have a deep thought for an hour and half. But anyway a line that Colin Firth, god that he is, had was "It's really ass-numbingly boring" I was like YOU'RE GOD. And he also said... "I don't give a flying fart in space" ok it doesn't get better than that.

That test was amazing. So many 80s references (shock). I clicked every answer that had to do with Emelio Estevez. The forgotten Sheen brother.

      SOMETHING SO RIGHT Annie Lennox  You've got the cool water When the river runs high And you've got the look of love Right in your eyes And I was in a crazy motion Till you calmed me down It took a little time But you calmed me down  Some people never say the words "I love you" It's not their style to be so bold Some people never say the words "I love you" But like a child They're longing to be told  They've got a wall in China It's a thousand miles long To keep out the foreigners They made it strong And I've got a wall around me That you can't even see It took a little time To get next to me  If something goes worng I'm the first to admit it The first to admit it But the last one to know If something goes right Well,it's likely to lose me It's apt to confuse me Because it's such an unusual sight Oh I can't get used to something so right Something so right  Some people never say the words "I love you" It's not their style to be so bold Some people never say the words "I love you" But like a child I'm longing to be told  They've got a wall in China And I've got a wall around me It took a little time To get next to me

Today's Wednesday Best (wait today's wednesday right?) is... Best Scene in a Movie: In High Fidelity when john cusack's character imagines beating the crap out of his ex-girlfriends new boyfriend. When his friend just blindsides that guy with the phone. And then they get the air conditioner. It's gold.

      yesterday my dad told me about when my cousin started working at this factory thing when he was nineteen. He had to like shovel ball bearings (don't ask, i don't know). So he's shovelling them into this bucket with a metal shovel when this guy comes up and starts flipping out. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING! IS THAT A METAL SHOVEL? WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY? You gata use a RUBBER shovel! Go get one over at the supply hut. You're lucky the boss didn't see you." So then John (my cousin) went over to the supply place but they told him that he had to go somewhere else to get a rubber shovel. They sent him all over the place. Finally someone took pity on him and said "look kid, there's no such thing as a rubber shovel." When dad told that story mom was all "awe, poor john" I was all... laughing uncontrollably. I really have to try something like that sometime. Hmm... new freshmen this year...

      alright i went to get my schedule changed today. I had to write this note thing. I made up some crap about the rehearsals interfering with my dance schedule. bahaha.  They said they would call me when as soon as the guidence counselor read it. I was like "when do you think that will be" and the woman goes "as soon as possible dear" oh, thank you for clarifying.

        Yale You're second best, and you know it. Still, those riding the crimson wave may be slightly smarter, slightly more prestigious, but you know you're hipper. I mean, you're not hip -- your a nerd, for fuck's sake -- but you're hipper.    urlLink   Which Ivy League University is right for YOU?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I like this quiz. Any result that can fit an unnecessary "fuck" earns my praise. Bonus points for using it in "for fuck's sake"

      I scored a  59%  on the &quot;how Media, PA, are you?&quot; Quizie!  urlLink What about you?    But I actually live in Media. That's a little on the sad side. I think it's because the questions were like "are you proud to know all this crap about media" or questions to that effect anyway.

      yesterday I saw a bumper sticker on a car that said "you can't be  catholic  and  pro-choice " I wasn't quite sure what message they were trying to send with that. Pro-choice or pro-life. Either way, they made a good point.

      I have a silverfish infestation in my room. You know what silverfish are. Those ugly little bugs that have about a thousand legs. Kinda like grey shorter centipedes. After we took the drop ceiling down all these holes in my walls were exposed. Recently I have discovered that silverfish slither at will in and out of these holes. They make this clicking noise against the insalation (sp?) when they crawl around. So I can hear them when they come out. It's the most annoying thing in the world. A few nights ago I had a spaz attack and duck taped all the holes up that are near my bed. i.e. an entire corner. And yet they CONTINUE to crawl around the wall directly next to my bed. I keep a shoe next to my bed.

      Apparently I am now living in Nazi Germany. Uber-Mom has banned my sister and I from using the word "freaking." Yes you heard it here first. My mother, Nazi wanna-be that she is, has banned me from using "freaking." Now, brace yourselves, here's her reason. AND I QUOTE, "because we all know what it is replacing." No, I am NOT kidding.

      holy.freaking.hell. ok so last night i set my alarm for 8:00 because I had to work today. So then at 8:00 this morning it goes off, but i am so not used to having an alarm i roll over turn it off and go back to sleep. Then I wake up at  9:45  as in fifteen minutes before I have to be at work. So basically i wake up and am like "FUCK!!!" i took about a three second shower. Ran downstairs grabbed some money for lunch shoved shoes on my feet and speed walked all the way down to the library. I was like ten minutes late. shh. My boss didn't notice. So I spent an ungodly boring 5 hours. Well it wasn't too bad cuz i was working with rachel, i.e. like the ONLY other paige that talks to me. haha anyway. Yeah I made long fake nails out of stickers I found in the cabinet underneath the desk. They say "Access Pennsylvania" yeah I don't know what that's supposed to mean either. Yeah so then I start walking home, in rain. But Rachel stopped and was like "i'll give you a ride home." and i was like "GOD BLESS YOU"

      oh.my.god. Last night my sister comes into my room and is like "I'm scared I can't sleep, I had a bad dream" I'm like "alright whatever." so i put a couple blankets on the floor and gave her a pillow. THEN i remembered that she can't sleep with the light off. Which meant I had to wait for her to sleep until I could turn the light off and go to sleep myself. I was up till three. Then I woke up at 10, couldn't get to sleep again so i came downstairs. I noticed a note my mother had left me before she went to work instructing me to take my sister on a walk around media so she can find things on her stupid scavanger hunt she has to do for school. so not fucking up for that. Worst morning in a while. goddamn you FAMILY.

      this is one of the best passages in Catch-22. I know it's long but it's well worth reading.  	“America,” he said, “will lose the war. And Italy will win it.” 	“America is the strongest and most prosperous nation on earth,” Nately Informed him with lofty fervor and dignity. “ And the American fighting man is second to none.” 	“Exactly,” agreed the old man pleasantly, with a hint of taunting amusement. “Italy, on the other hand, is one of the least prosperous nations on earth. And the Italian fighting man is probably second to all. And that’s exactly why my country is doing so well in this war while your country is doing so poorly.” 	Nately guffawed with surprise, then blushed apologetically for his impoliteness. “I’m sorry I laughed at you,” he said sincerely, and he continued in a tone of respectful condescension. “But Italy was occupied by the Germans and is now being occupied by us. YOu don’t call that doing very well do you?” 	“But of course I do,” exclaimed the old man cheerfully. “The Germans are being driven out, and we are still here. In a few years you will be gone too, and we will still be here. You see, Italy is really a very poor and weak country, and that’s what makes us so strong. Italian soldiers are not dying any more. But American and German soldiers are. I call that doing extremely well. Yes, I am quite certain that Italy will survive this war and still be in existence long after your own country has been destroyed.” 	Nately could scarcely believe his ears. He had never heard such shocking blasphemies before, and he wondered with instinctive logic G-men did not appear to lock the traitorous old man up. “America is not going to be destroyed!” he shouted passionately. 	“Never?” prodded the old man softly. 	“Well...” Nately faltered. 	The old man laughed indulgently, holding in check a deeper, more explosive delight. HIs groading remained gentle. “Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed, great countries are destroyed. Why not yours? How much longer do you really think your own country will last? Forever? Keep in mind that the earth itself is destined to be destroyed by the sun in twenty-five million years or so.” 	Nately squirmed uncomfortably. “Well, forever is a long time, I guess.” 	“A million years?” persisted the jeering old man with keen, sadistic zest. “A half million? The frog is almost five hundred million years old. Could you really say with much certainty that America, with all its strength and prosperity, with its fighting man that is second to none, and with its standard of living that is the highest in the world, will last as long as... the frog?”...  ... "Well, frankly, I don’t know how long America is going to last,” he proceeded dauntlessly. “I suppose we can’t last forever if the world itself is going to be destroyed someday. But I do know that we’re going to survive and triumph for a long, long time.” 	“For how long?” mocked the profane old man with a gleam of malicious elation. “Not even as long as the frog?” 	“Much longer than you or me,” Nately blurted out lamely. 	“Oh, is that all! That won’t be very much longer then, considering that you’re so gullible and brave and that I am already such an old, old man.” 	“How old are you?” Nately asked, growing intrigued and charmed with the old man in spite of himself. 	“A hundred and seven.” The old man chuckled heartily at Nately’s look of chagrin. “I see you don’t believe that either.” 	“I don’t believe anything you tell me,” Nately replied, with a bashful mitigating smile. “The only thing I do believe is that America is going to win the war.” 	“You put so much stock in winning wars,” the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed. “The real trick lies in losing  wars, in knowing which wars can be lost. Italy has been losing wars for centuries, and just see how splendidly we’ve done nonetheless. France wins wars and is in a continual state of crisis. Germany loses and prospers. Look at our own recent history. Italy won a war in Ethiopia and promptly stumbled into serious trouble. VIctory gave us such insane delusions of grandeur that we helped start a world war we hadn’t a chance of winning. But now that we are losing again, everything has taken a turn for the better, and we will certainly come out on top again if we succeed in being defeated.” 	Nately gaped at him in undisguised befuddlement. “Now I really don’t understand what you’re saying. You talk like a madman.” 	“But I live like a sane one. I was a fascist when Mussolini was on top, and I am an antifascist now that he has been disposed. I was fanatically pro-German when the Germans were here to protect us against the Americans, and that the Americans are here to protect us against the Germans I am fanatically pro-American. I can assure you, my outraged young friends” -the old old man’s knowing disdainful eyes shone even more effervescently as Nately’s stuttering dismay increased- “that you and your country will have no more loyal partisan in Italy than me-but only as long as you remain in Italy.” 	“But,” Nately cried out in disbelief, “you’re a turncoat! A time-server! A shameful, unscrupulous opportunist!” 	“I am a hundred and seven years old,” the old man reminded him suavely. 	“Don’t you have any principles?” 	“Of course not.” 	“No morality” 	“Oh, I am a very moral man,” the villainous old man assured him with satiric seriousness, stroking the bare hip of a buxom black-haired girl with pretty dimples who had stretched herself out seductively on the other arm of his chair. He grinned at Nately sarcastically as he sat between both naked girls in smug and threadbare splendor, with a sovereign hand on each. 	“I can’t believe it,” Nately remarked grudgingly, trying stubbornly not to watch him in relationship to the two girls. “I simply can’t believe it.” 	“But it’s all perfectly true. When the Germans marched into the city, I danced in the streets like a youthful ballerina and shouted, ‘Heil Hitler!’ until my lungs were hoarse. I even waved a small Nazi flag that I had snatched away from a beautiful little girl while her mother was looking the other way. When the Germans left the city, I rushed out to welcome the Americans with a bottle of excellent brandy and a basket of flowers. The brandy was for myself, of course, and the flowers were to sprinkle on the liberators. There was a very stiff and stuffy old major riding in the first car, and i hit him squarely in the eye with a red rose. A marvelous shot! You should have seen him wince.” 	Nately gasped and was on his feet with amazement, the blood draining from his cheeks. “Major- de Coverly!” he cried. 	“Do you know him?” inquired the old man with delight. “What a charming coincidence!” 	Nately was too astonished even to hear him. “So you’re the one who wounded Major- de Coverly!” he exclaimed in horrified indignation. “How could you do such a thing?” 	The fiendish old man was unperturbed. “How could I resist, you mean. You should have seen the arrogant old bore, sitting there so sternly in that car like the Almighty Himself, with his big, rigid head and his foolish solemn face. What a tempting target he made! I got him in the eye with an American Beauty rose. I thought that was most appropriate. Don’t you?” 	“That was a terrible thing to do!” Nately shouted at him reproachfully. “A vicious and criminal thing! Major- de Coverly is our squadron executive officer!” 	“Is he?” teased the unregenerate old man, pinching his pointy jaw gravely in parody of repentance. “In that case, you must give me credit for being impartial. When the Germans rode in, I almost stabbed a robust young Oberstleutnant to death with a sprig of edelweiss.” 	Nately was appalled and bewildered by the abominable old man’s inability to perceive the enormity of his offense. “Don’t you realize what you’ve done?” he scolded vehemently. “Major- de Coverly is a noble and wonderful person, and everyone admires him.” 	“He’s a silly old fool who really has no right acting like a silly young fool. Where is he today? Dead?” 	Nately answered softly with somber awe. “Nobody know. He seems to have disappeared.” 	“You see? Imagine a man his age risking what little life he has left for something so absurd as a country.” 	Nately was instantly up in arms again. “There is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country!” he declared. 	“Isn’t there?” asked the old man. “What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can’t all be worth dying for.” 	“Anything worth living for,” said Nately, “is worth dying for.” 	“And anything worth dying for,” answered the sacrilegious old man, “is certainly worth living for. You know, you’re such a pure and naive young man that I almost feel sorry for you. How old are you? Twenty-five? Twenty- six?” 	“Nineteen,” said Nately. “I’ll be twenty in January.” 	“If you live.” The old man shook his head, wearing, for a moment, the same touchy, meditating frown of the fretful and disapproving old woman. “They are going to kill you if you don’t watch out, and I can see now that you are not going to watch out. Why don’t you use some sense and try to be more like me? You might live to be a hundred and seven, too.” 	“Because it’s better to die on one’s feet than live on one’s knee,” Nately retorted with triumphant and lofty conviction. “I guess you’ve heard that saying before.” 	“Yes, I certainly have,” mused the treacherous old man, smiling again. “But I’m afraid you have it backward. It is better to live on one’s feet than die on one’s knees. That is the way the saying goes.

      so i've been cleaning for like the past two hours, deterring from my plan of not leaving my room all day and reading, but hey whatever, i'm over it. *overthinks it* *has aneurism(sp?)* anywho our tv is currently at boscov's so we can go pick it up. sorta yay, i guess. I've kinda gotten used to not having it. At least now I can watch bbcamerica and ifc religiously again. hahaha. a few minutes ago mom threw a magazine at me "Pottery Barn Teen" the title alone is enough to make you cringe. Actually there were a lot of kick-ass things in there. It made me want to completely redo my room. And then I was like "oh wait, i have no money and my parents sure as hell aren't going to pay to redo my room, so giving me this magazine was really just a cruel joke on my mom's part" but anyway in like every single room they have they have their own laptop and i'm like "hmmm" gears are turning (which is quite unusual actually) so i'm going to go look up iBook prices (yes another mac, mainly because i don't want to pay for my own internet and networking a pc to a mac is much more expensive than networking a mac to a mac, besides mac isn't that bad)

      MOTHER OF ASS!!!!!!!!!!!! i ended up clicking the answer that was like self indulgence, stubborn, materialistic (all of these must be trace in overall personality, just making sure everyone gets that). My whole dilema was not getting a person like my father. AND I END UP WITH A LEO ANYWAY. good lord i'm doomed to marry someone like mi padre (my worst fear) and look at the characteristics; arrogant, sulky, smug. good lord. I have lost all faith in internet quizzes.

        You should be dating a Leo. 23 July - 22 August This mate is honest and loyal, with a sunny disposition.  Though this lion has the tendency to be arrogant, sulky or smug, he/she is unrestrained in bed.    urlLink   What Zodiac Sign Are You Attracted To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I was gonna take that quiz on anna's blog that was like "which zodiac sign are you attracted to" but came to a stand-still at this last question.. Which of the following negative characteristics can you tolerate from your mate? Bossiness, jealousy, selfishness.   Self indulgence, stubborn, materialistic.   Gossipy, irritable and impatient.   Possessive, moody, selfishness.   Arrogance, sulkiness and smugness.   Scathingly critical, cranky and irritable.   Overbearing, sulky, manipulative.   Self-destructive, ruthless, overbearing.   Argumentative, impatient, critical.   Egotistical, anxious, unforgiving.   Tactless, rude, self-interested.   Self-pitying, temperamental, dependent.    had a problem with this question because I can't deal with any of these characteristics. Especially the ones that have to do with being a) self-obsessed (that includes self-pity), manipulative b) mopey, sulky, and self-destructive (though that last one could also go under "a") or c) overbearing, critical, arrogant... and that would leave me with....gossipy, irritable, and impatient. Wow... um... I don't think so. If I HAD to choose I think I'd say...well no, that was useless. The only one I could accept would be elitist, because well from this last entry alone I think we can conclude that our personalities would then match.

As much as I read I got that she was some like elf thingy that lived in a tree or she was the tree i don't know. But she was in paris and like she was all mopey because she was stuck there and couldn't see anything. I don't know. Like I said.  BORING.

      we still have the same dentist that we had when we lived in south philly. So a few days ago I go into south philly with my dad for our dentist appointment. The dentist's office is right by where we used to live so, after having my mouth stabbed repeatedly with a little pointy stick (that could sound so wrong if put into the right context) we go and visit some old neighbors. Or rather my dad spoke to some old people while i counted how long I waited... in seconds... with no watch. Anyway, some of the people we visited were our old landlords, Tony and Lee (old married couple). Tony was a drug dealer for the mob. (so I'm sure our house was completely devoid of any stashes, and I'm CERTAIN Tony didn't buy that house with drug money. Note the sarcasm. Man can my parents pick 'em). Anyway Tony got busted and was in jail for most of the time that we lived in that house. But anywhat while we were visiting them Lee said "oh look how big she's (me) gotten! I remember when we used to babysit her." ok think about that. That one sentence there has made me COMPLETELY question my childhood. My parents, geniuses that they are, let DRUG DEALERS babysit me. When I was an infant and couldn't protect myself. Ok in case you didn't get that let me say it again. They let drug dealers, who worked for the mob, take care of they're infant child. How am I still alive? I mean with the amazing taste they had in babysitters, how did I manage to survive to the age of 15. Good lord! I seriously think that I am still here because of sheer dumb luck. hahaha what parents.

      ok one thing i would like to comment on before i forget to blog it. That political stock market thing, where they bet on whether Middle-Eastern leaders will be assasinated, or when terrorist attacks will occur in the Middle East is the most DISGUSTING and TWISTED thing I have EVER heard of in my entire life. It is absolutely appalling. It literally makes me sick. Turning the turmoil, suffering, murdering in the middle east that people deal with everyday into a fucking game. It's like betting on horses, only instead of horses it's people's LIVES. That is so wrong on so many levels. And it's run by the PENTAGON. As in, OUR GOVERNMENT. wow. Sure makes you want to put a hell of a lot of confidence in our country's leaders doesn't it. Just think about. Making money off of someone being murdered. Doesn't that just kind of hint at hit man. Isn't it just a little reminiscent of something the MAFIA would do. Some kind of pool the black market would have. Oh speaking of our lovely American Values based government, has anyone heard about this new thing the republicans are trying to get. It's monitoring what books people buy or borrow from the library. If that doesn't SCREAM invasion of privacy, I don't know what does. It's another "terrorist provension" techniques. Think about that though, monitoring what you read. Big Brother is watching. Who knows what's next? Book burning perhaps? Wouldn't want to give the American public any bad ideas. Wow. da na na na da na na na...You are now entering the Twilight Zone...

      ok um I haven't posted in a while besides that last post. And I don't really feel like retyping all this stuff I did today, so I'm just going to copy paste from an e-mail i wrote to anna some of it might not make sense, because it's like in response to an e-mail she sent me and I really can't be bothered to edit it out...  hey there,      you shouldn't have written to me i have absolutely nothing to say. My life is really really boring. Um, there's this really hot guy at camp, Billy. (i can get past the name) He's another counselor, don't worry I'm not a pedophile. He's our age.  HE HAS FREAKING DREADLOCKS. It's amazing. Don't worry, he's black so it's not dirty. But unfortunately he lives in LA, he's just visiting his grandparents here. sigh oh vell. Also today being the last day of camp and all (and there was much rejoicing, yay) we rented a waterslide. It's like a vertical inflatable slip 'n' slide. Well at the end of camp when all the kids went home like a dozen counselors (myself and billy included) went on the deflating (because we were so heavy all together... or alone in some cases cough NORM cough) in like torrential rain in our clothes. It was AMAZING. so fun. plus I got my pay check. plus camp is freaking OVER. alright moving right on along. Tonight I'm going to my aunts house because my parents are going to cape may for a wedding and my sister is going to some party thing. I would stay home alone, but we don't have a tv, or air conditioning, or food. So I opted to invite myself over to my aunts. But this also means I have to go to another wedding with her tomorrow, but that's kinda good too because I can wear my new pretty polkadot dress I got at V generation. Anyway so going back to the camp topic. All the kids were playing limbo. And like if they touched the bar the were out so we could find a winner. So that damned little drag queen riley touched the bar. And I'm like "Riley, go stand against the fence until the game's over, you touched the bar." and he's all "no i didn't" and i'm all "goddammit riley stand against the fence" only a little cleaner. And he argued with me for like five minutes and then went running crying to steve. I'm like ok WHATEVER. But then running there he stepped on a bee and got stung. I laughed my ass off. KARMA. wow, so much for absolutely nothing to say. Well at least you'll have something to do for a while. i.e. read this. I'll just wait till you get back from maine to get the cds. Wow I can't believe it took up three. I didn't think I chose that much. But then again i really did pick a lot. bahahahhahahaha. ok well i gata go and shower all the grass out of my hair. much love, allie p.s. madeline's not wearing pants.

        this is No Armed Stick Figure Sue, Sticky Sue for short. She has no arms, but she is still "hot stuf." She has no job or life so she eats a lot. Now she's fat.   She spent all the money she doesn't have on food. So now she is dirt poor. She decides to prostitute herself on the mean streets of downtown Paoli.   Since she has no arms she can't give people hand jobs, so she gives them foot jobs instead. She isn't very popular except with one guy who bought her sweet foot jobs, Stud Muffin Tod. She lost all her weight from running from pimps and police.   Stud Muffin Tod (S & M Bitch for short) is a little ambigious, if ya know what i mean. He is a high roller (note his kick-ass rich guy's hat) S & M Bitch has one leg shorter than the other, but doesn't let that hinder him. Thanks to S & M Bitch's foot job money Sticky Sue isn't poor anymore and enjoys the finer things... like money.   that's all for now.

      Firewalls  1997 Honorable Mention Unconfirmed by Darwin  (1997, England) There's ordinary foolishness, and then there's extraordinary foolishness. Stealing fireworks from a storage depot is foolishness. But using a welder's torch to cut through the wall of the building housing the fireworks -- that is extraordinary foolishness.   Several burglars pushed their luck to the brink of failure when they tried to pull off a heist of a building containing a large volume of fireworks. They used a cutting torch to slice through the main door, which was eight feet tall and reinforced with a solid inch of steel. Just as the torch penetrated the door, and success was at hand... a spark landed in a crate of fireworks near the door.   Fireworks are explosive, and this particular crate contained the equivalent of a hundred pounds of gunpowder. The entire factory exploded, and the door was popped from its hinges and slammed flat into the ground.   Astoundingly, the perpetrators were not killed, and have never been found. Flabbergasted pyrotechnics professionals have dubbed them the "Hole in the Ground Gang."   if that is not the MOST AMAZING thing you have ever heard...

      me and anna have gone through all the special occasion dresses on www.fashion1001nights.com and have come up with the top five WORST dresses/poses/models.

IT'S SHINY!! It looks like she's been vaccuum sealed in a horribly colored plastic bag   1. this one just tops them all ... it looks like a 5 year old took their arts and crafts  materials and some horrible pink fabric, glued it all together, and called it a dress

      Sixth Level of Hell - The City of Dis  You approach Satan's wretched city where you behold a wide plain surrounded by iron walls. Before you are fields full of distress and torment terrible. Burning tombs are littered about the landscape. Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell.  Ok I would like to point out this frase here....The three infernal Furies stained with blood,   with limbs of women   and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell.  hmmm...

      It took a while (because apparently they don't like to go out in the sun) but I convinced my parents to go rent movies. Then Dad vetoed all my suggestions: Phonebooth, Secretary, To Live, etc. So we ended up renting, prepare yourselves, Spy Kids 2 and Solaris. Great annoying kids movie and sci-fi. So glad I forced them to go get movies.

      Lewis C.K for... "Ya know what happens when you only have 20 bucks in the bank? They call you up and say 'Sir, I'm afraid you have insufficient funds' 'Hmm. Well that's an interesting thing to say I'm broke. But you're right I DO have insufficient funds. In fact I was just about to call YOU' 'No, sir, you don't understand we're going to have to penalize you fifteen dollars' So now I have 5 dollars in the bank. They take from the guy who only has twenty bucks. But ya know what happens when you have a lot of money THEY PAY YOU MORE. So then I have even less money in the bank so they take fifteen dollars again. So now I have negative ten dollars. I don't even have no money. Negative ten dollars. That means I can't afford something that costs nothing."

Best Stand-Up Routine: Well this is a tough one... it was between Lewis Black and Lewis C.K. How about a tie y'all.  Lewis Black for... "All of the sudden there was a discussion going on in every office in the United States. That discussion was 'Is oral sex adultery?' Now, did I miss a day in school? I never paid attention but did the principal come over the intercom and say 'Today lunch will be fish sticks, and remember kids BJs don't count.' YES ORAL SEX IS ADULTERY!!! If curling is an olymic sport than oral sex is adultery. Oral sex should be an olymic sport because it's hard and if you can do it well you deserve a medal!"  the other example to come in a later post

      grr. My dad is such an asshole. When Noelle drove me home we had to stop for gas and then she needed to get some cards from Hallmark. By the time we were done I had to go and get my sister from school anyway so she drove me there and gave us a ride back. I thought both my parents were at work today, because ya know that's what they told me, so I didn't bother calling to tell them I was late. When we were driving to the house we passed my dad walking from his car to the school, I guess he got home early. So then when I get back he goes AND I QUOTE "Mom needs you to take the movies back to the library and drop these letters off." And he was acting all mad like I should have done this already WHEN I JUST WALKED IN THE DOOR. On top of that he couldn't just bring them down with them when he went to pick up Gio. Would that have been such a hardship? God forbid he thinks about someone else. And on top of THAT, I can't even walk right and he  knows it . My leg has been acting up since like Saturday and he expects me to walk 3/4 of a mile AND BACK. I told him all that and he goes "I think mom meant for you to do that." AND THEN in response to "you except me to walk 1.5 miles when I can't even really use my right leg" he says "Well  I  have to work" and he said it like I was just making up some lame excuse. I was just like wow so PHYSICALLY can't do it, but your excuse is you can't do it because you can't spare five fucking minutes from CHECKING YOUR GODDAMN E-MAIL YOU INSENSITIVE BASTARD. I hate that man sometimes. There is no way I am walking down. Oh or I do am in pain for like a day and a half and blame it on him. OH BETTER go don't come back for like three hours and say "well i just didn't think I could spend the next few hours with you" and throw that line back in his face from the time he gave my hockey ticket away. Again, sometimes I hate that man.

      I was watching SNL once and weekend update was on and they were talking about Bob Dylan's son, whatshisface. And they go "It must have sucked being Bob Dylan's son and having a garage band. Your dad comes down and says 'Turn that down!' 'You just don't understand our music!' 'NO, I'm Bob Dylan! You guys just suck!'" It was amazing. And I thought, "How true."

      I actually like this one. I think the cut looks nice. I'll probably get something like this done when I cut my hair. Minus the highlights. Maybe. This is the only picture that actually did what I wanted it to.

      Ok when I tried to make the picture smaller my eyes kind-of became posessed looking. Note: I do not look like that in real life. Also, that really short hair just makes me look like a boy. Or like I'm in the army. Or both I suppose.

      Thanks to Mal I have a new phrase. "Suck it." It can apply to anything. If someone flips you off you can say "Suck it!" If someone cuts you off in traffic. "Suck it!"  "Allie? Did you do your homework today?" "Suck it!... Ma'am."  "Some weather we're having, eh?" "SUCK IT"  It works on many levels.

      I have become completely convinced that when I speak to my family I sound like the adults in Charlie Brown. I've been telling my mom for like a few months now that I need 4 or 5 white feather boas for my Bjork in the Swan dress costume and I wanted to go to like wallmart or a dollar store to get one because if you go to a halloween shop they're 10-20 bucks. So today she goes to a Halloween store and buys me one. I appreciate the gesture but when I see that bag that says "Halloween Town" and when I say "you only bought one?" and she gets all confused, it makes me think that maybe I just shouldn't bother talking anymore.

You would be known by a series of names since you would go under many aliases and have a number of disguises. You are very clever and creative, and would almost always be one step ahead of the authorities. You would make sure no evidence of your horrible murders would be left behind, and if it is, no one would know it was you. You sneaky, elusive person...authorities would have hard time trying to catch you. You would definitely be the mystery criminal. People may not even know the your killings are all from you.

      Wow, I've never been so happy for it to be the weekend. Yay Thanksgiving! I'll just ignore the fact that that holiday is the shining example of all the propaganda this country has been feeding us and that there was no first thanksgiving like we're told it was and when the pilgrams came it was really just the beginning of a huge Native American genocide. Oh yeah and there is that whole thing of me being a vegetarian so seeing a huge dead bird on the table is possibly the most disgusting thing I could see while eating. But I get two days off so... Happy Turkey Day y'all.

      dude, I just happened to mention to my parents that I might want to go to college in england and my looked up colleges for me to go to in England Spain and Italy. I was like "Italy? I DON'T EVEN SPEAK ITALIAN" Besides the fact it's two and a half years away, I have no idea what I want to study in college or what I want to do with my life including carreer, education, and all that other stuff. I'm like "yeah pressure much?" Actually I didn't say that but if I did I bet you so much money he would say "Well I don't mean to put pressure on you, but this is something you're going to have to start thinking about. You know, college is only two years away." And it would sound so patronizing you would be forced to punch him in the face. Thus my silence.

      ok prepare for some bitching... GAH today was not my day. This morning Noelle's car doors were frozen shut and she tried for like twenty minutes to get them open. Didn't work so mum drove us. I had to do my language arts homework, otherwise I wouldn't have cared if we missed homeroom. At least I wasn't marked absent. Then I failed the test in math, because I just didn't study. Gym we had to row and my calves were killing me because I never stretch them and they pull EXTREMELY easily, plus my ass got all sweaty from sitting on the stupid rower. Ass sweat is the worst. Both me and Anna forgot about the science project due today. Oh yeah and that Spanish test, definitely spelled like um, everything wrong. Plus I am sick and tired. And today's not even over yet! I have two projects due tomorrow, two tests tomorrow, plus language arts homework. And I'm like falling over tired. Like If I close my eyes for more than 5 seconds I will fall off of this chair in a dead sleep. School is ruining my life.

Oh for fuck's sake, I have to work tomorrow AGAIN. what the hell. Scratch the happy part. 029.

      I saw Love Actually today. It was amazing. Colin Firth dove into a lake. Hugh Grant danced and said "saucy minx." All in all it was very good.

      I've watched far too many romantic comedies today... now I'm depressed. And yet, one of them contained Colin Firth jumping into a lake, so really not that depressed.

      22-Year-Old Fuck Complains Of Age Discrimination SAN MIGUEL, CA—Passed over for a promotion at Barton Financial Services, little 22-year-old fuck Darren Meeker filed a lawsuit against the company Monday, claiming to be a victim of age discrimination. "Just because someone has 20 years of experience, that doesn't automatically make him more qualified than my client," said attorney Martin Lippman, who represents the whiny shit. "In his first seven months on the job, Mr. Meeker has more than proven his potential." The little prick was unavailable for comment.  i cocking love the onion

      Dude I just watched Dane Cook on Comedy Central. It was so funny. "I don't have a religion, oh wait I'm Catholic" on communion... "you get your little cruton-o-christ, jesits." "mleh. Lord's a little stale today. Might want to check the date on that Lord." "I always just wanted to grab that whole bowl and run home, pour some milk on it. Have some Christ Chex. Wouldn't that be cool if there was actually a cereal called Christ Chex. 'Start your day off the Holy Way with Christ Chex." on the peace be with you thing... "When the priest is doing his 'peace' speech everyone's looking around picking out all the people they aren't going to shake hands with. Like 'psht, fuck that guy, I'm not shaking his hand. No dude I'm good, I'm shaking this guys hand. *smack* HEY I said no!'"

      I've been fucking tripping over shit and like randomly falling and running into things way to much recently, I'm like no, not cool. Yesterday I slid down three stairs in a staircase in B-wing. I don't even know how it happened. All of the sudden I was just on the floor. I was a little confused.

      GAH!!! this computer is so fucking slow. Jesus Christ, it took me like twenty minutes just to get to this page. Mother of ass. I'm gonna put like three posts in one because um, I don't know if I'm going to be able to load this page again. Yeah I watched Changing Rooms last night (the british version of Trading Spaces, Changing Rooms came first and is MUCH better, BBC america is my life) and I've decided that my goal in life is to either be Handy Andy's (the designated carpenter) assistant, or replace Handy Andy when the show starts to go south and he bails. But yeah that is definitely my goal. I could be like "the american" yeah. And there was something else I wanted to say. Oh well couldn't have been that important.

You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank? You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!"

      damn, now I've dissapointed myself, I really  do  want to play scrabble with Weezer, Tori Amos, and Jesus. I bet Jesus would cheat, though. He'd be all "It's a word if I say it is! I am your Lord and Savior and what I say goes!" and we'd be all "Dude, 'aklsdfhoid' is NOT in the dictionary!" and he'd be all, "Sure it is *preforms miracle* SEE 'aklsdfhoid- one who aklsdfho-icizes' DOUBLE WORD SCORE" and we'd be all "Bastard."

BAND:  (weezer) make them play forever, and then maybe we could play scrabble     Your fav. ARTIST:  (tori amos) be in awe, and then get her in on the scrabble action with Weezer, and maybe we could get Jesus, down there in the last question, in on it too     Yo momma:  no YO MAMMA     Jesus/God:  I don't believe in God.

      Oh my god today driving home this car in front of us just like randomly put its brakes on and we were going to fast to make an abrupt stop and not hit him so Noelle goes to swerve around him and this other car comes and we clipped him. Me, Anna, Angie, and Noelle were flipping out. And then Noelle pulls over because she thought that that's what everyone else was going to do and like everyone else just like sped away even the van pulling out of Elwyn. It was hilarious.

You can see it in the water, like liquid silver. We're not going to sit here and take it. No sir."

      Brick- Ben Folds Five  6 am day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark The smell of cold Car seat is freezing The world is sleeping I am numb  Up the stairs to the apartment She is balled up on the couch Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte They're not home to find us out And we drive Now that I have found someone I'm feeling more alone Than I ever have before  She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly  They call her name at 7:30 I pace around the parking lot Then I walk down to buy her flowers And sell some gifts that I got Can't you see It's not me you're dying for Now she's feeling more alone Than she ever has before  She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly  As weeks went by It showed that she was not fine They told me son, it's time to tell the truth She broke down, and I broke down Cause I was tired of lying  Driving back to her apartment For a moment we're alone Yeah she's alone I'm alone Now I know it  She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

      Mom woke me up this morning at 9 fucking o'clock to tell me that she would call me at twelve from work. I'm like, "woman! Why didn't you just call. I don't need a heads up. I have to be up by then to go to work anyway!" And then of course, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get back to sleep because it was so fucking bright. Goddamn.

      I just saw that Mal quoted me on her blog talking about that stupid Hilary Duff song, "So Yesterday" Don't even get me started on the title. Ok here are the lyrics: Hilary Duff-So Yesterday (So yesterday) (So yesterday) (So yesterday) You can change your life (If you wanna) You can change your clothes (If you wanna) If you change your mind Well that's the way it goes But I'm gonna keep your jeans And your old black hat ('Cuz I wanna) They look good on me You're never gonna get them back At least not today Not today Not today, 'cuz If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday So yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay You can say you're bored (If you wanna) You can act real tough (If you wanna) You could say you're torn But I've heard enough Thank you You've made my mind up for me When you started to ignore me Do you see a single tear It isn't gonna happen here At least not today Not today Not today, 'cuz If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday So yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay If you're over me, I'm already over you If it's all been done, What is left to do How can you hang up,If the line is dead If you walk out, I'm a step ahead If you're movin' on, I'm already gone If the light is off, Then it isn't on At least not today Not today Not today, 'cuz If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday Haven't you heard you're so (yesterday) If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday So yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay  here is my comment: Ok if you were that guy wouldn't you be like "Bitch, give me my stuff back." and also probably "Stop leaving creepy messages on my machine"  but mainly what I'm getting from this song is that she's really just a clepto.

      I'm off to Bradford today. In a few minutes if my parents can decide on the best method to pack boots into the car (in a bag or not, on top of everything or on the bottom.) They have this same discussion every year. It always takes like twenty minutes and in the end they just end up bagless and thrown on top. Ashley, my love, I made the cover of your calander. It's amazing. I couldn't find a real calander good enough so I'm making it out of a little photo album with otters on the front. It's god. AH! We're leaving right now. MERRY CHRISTMAS! and a happy boxing day!

      Real-Life Grinch Celebrates 'Hanukkah' FREDONIA, KSâ€”A real-life Grinch was found Monday in Fredonia, where, unlike his fellow residents, Josh Baum refuses to celebrate Christmas. "I'm looking forward to a nice Hanukkah," the Yuletide-shunning misanthrope said. "We'll be lighting the same menorah that's been in my family for generations." Baum would not comment on the possibility that spontaneous Christmas caroling would cause his small heart to grow three sizes. from  urlLink TheOnion.com

      I saw the new Lord of the Rings a few days ago, I can't remember when. It exceeded expectations. Let me tell you. It was crazy. I mean there was inuendo EVERYWHERE. I laughed through the whole thing. Man, it delivered. I mean right from the beginning with the guy struggling with the fishing pole, you just knew you were in for a good movie. And then that one scene randomly at one of the times when the movie SHOULD have ended but continued to not end, when everyone is laughing. That was disturbing and yet at the same time hilarious in an amateur porn kind of way.

      Funniest thing happened driving from the school to the mall. Hilarious. Noelle drove into the wrong lane (she was trying for the left turn lane) and she ended up heading for a head on collision with a bus. The bus was like a quarter of a mile away, which made it even more hilarious. She tries to like pull over and get out of the way and the bus driver is looking at us like "DUMBASS! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?" I was like trying not to laugh because Noelle was so unbelievably embarrassed. And then she had to drive over the median to get out of the way and I just lost it. I died laughing. Seriously, if I had had more to drink today I would have pissed myself. It was insane. I laughed so hard. I couldn't talk for like five minutes straight. Hahahahahahahahahahhaha. oh god... What makes it even funnier is that we were in no immediate harm. Like she just looked really stupid. The closest thing to harm we were in was the yellow cheese bus coming at us at like 15 miles an hour. Hahahaha. Oh my god. That made my YEAR.

      Bush Won't Put Down New Football WASHINGTON, DCâ€”According to White House sources, President Bush has not allowed his new Wilson official NFL leather game football to leave his sight since he received it as a gift last week. "The president has that ball with him everywhere he goes," Vice-President Dick Cheney said Monday. "The way he pump-fakes it in the Oval Office is really distracting." Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has threatened to take the ball away and lock it in his desk if he sees it at the table during another goddamned cabinet meeting.  from  urlLink TheOnion.com

      Anna told me in science that someone is going to come caroling at my house. Don't. I hate carolers. A few nights ago these carolers (damn I wish I could spell) came by and they were all "We're from a church group and we're caroling because we're new in the neighborhood." I was like "Get the hell off my front lawn." It was funny 'cause mom was in the background like "Don't answer the door!"

      All I Want For Christmas Is You- Mariah Carey  I don't want a lot for Christmas There's just one thing I need I don't care about presents Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true... All I want for Christmas Is you...  I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about presents Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to hang my stocking There upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you... You baby  I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for Saint Nick I won't even stay awake to Hear those magic reindeer click 'Cause I just want you here tonight Holding on to me so tight What more can I do Baby all I want for Christmas is you You...  All the lights are shining So brightly everywhere And the sound of children's Laughter fills the air And everyone is singing I hear those sleigh bells ringing Santa won't you bring me the one I really need -  won't you please bring my baby to me...  Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas This is all I'm asking for I just want to see baby Standing right outside my door Oh I just want him for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true Baby all I want for Christmas is You...  All I want for Christmas is you baby... (repeat)

      This morning when I woke up it was quiet for all of twenty minutes. Then Gio woke up, and my parents came home from grocery shopping. Then it became so loud that I couldn't even make a phone call because even though I was clearly talking into a phone, everyone decided to talk to me AT ONCE. Now they're gone again, and there is silence. I can't wait till I move out and it's like this all the time.

      At the pep rally today (which I REALLY wanted to skip but hey whatever) the seniors succeeded in doing what we could not. Instead of yelling "L-I-O-N-S LIONS!" for the lions roar, they yelled "B-O-N-E-R BONER!" We tried to get "P-E-N-I-S PENIS!" for the sophomores, but we couldn't get everyone to do it. Sigh. Maybe next time.

      A - Act your age – meh, I guess so. 15. Yeah that sounds about right.  B - Breast size – it would suck if you were a really fat guy taking this quiz. Cuz then you'd have to be like.... "double d" I, however, am not a really fat guy.   C - Chore you hate – pick one  D - Dad's name - Lucifer, but his friends call him Bob  E - Essential make up item – chap stick/ lip gloss, and concealer when I haven't had a good night's sleep  F - Favorite actor – colin firth, a close second is hugh grant. And that guy who plays Jeff on Coupling (BBC) is my god. The fact that they are all british has nothing to do with it... baha.  G - Gold or silver - silver's prettier in my opinon.  H - Hometown – South Philly, a block away from the projects. Yeah, it was a good neighborhood  I - Instruments you play – ooo, that'd be nothing. Seriously, I can't even play the triangle. Or like finger symbols.  J - Job title - receptionist. That's what they call me, but I'm really that person in the office that sits at the front desk and makes office supply jewelry all day. I have a paper clip tiara coming along nicely  K - Kids – EW. I hate kids. They're slimy ALL the time, they smell and they grope you when you're not looking. Plus they want to be fed like all the time. Stupid little fuckers.  L - Living arrangements – my ugly room. Stupid hideous wall color. I've devised a plan though. If my parents won't let me paint it (the stupid constantly shit-faced fuckers) I'm going to hang sarong/tapastry type things so you can't see it. It's genius.  M - Mum's name - Clara  N - Number of people you've kissed - Right, let me post something that personal on my blog.  O - Overnight hospital stays – only on overnight stay, when dad had some crazy kidney stone thing. yeah, that was fun. He was all "i have appendicitis" and we had to go to the hostpital at 2 o'clock in the morning, and he's like "oh wait just kidding'  P - Phobia –muppets. I don't care what anyone says they are fucking creepy and they give me nightmares  Q - Quote you like – "I did everything he did only backwards and in high heels"- Ginger Rogers  R - Religious affiliation – agnostic/atheist i guess. I don't know. One of those. It's kind of hard to label something like that  S - Siblings – one, little sister, gio  T - Time you wake up? 6:30 during the week, ususally 11 (i'd sleep later if my family wasn't so fucking loud) on the weekends  U - Unique ability – i can make anything sound dirty  V - Vegetable you refuse to eat - mushrooms  W - Worst habit – i don't think i have one. I'm pretty happy with all my habits.  X - X-rays you've had – um... only the ones you get at the dentist, and I don't think those count  Y - Yummy food you make – if i make food i can guarentee you it ain't gonna be yummy, or edible. More likely, dangerous to your health.  Z - Zodiac Sign - aries, the ram baby!

      mleh, headache again. But today is cool because Mal's coming over. yay. In Language Arts we're reading Arsenic and Old Lace. I was so excited when we started reading because I was all "I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE!!! It has Carey Grant. It's amazing." Miss Dillon was the only person who knew what I was talking about. I don't care. It's a good movie.

      shit, I'm so sick. My head feels like it's going to explode. I'm all dizzy, which means I have a fever. But mother was fucking home today. What the hell?! Why can't she have a real job where she works everyday. I probably should have stayed home and just stayed in my room all day. But she'd come up eventually. My headache is bad enough, the last thing I need is to spend the day with my mother. *shudder* I'll stay home next tuesday. Hopefully Noelle will stay home then too and we can go out to breakfast, like I was planning to do today. Damn parents ruin everything.

      I've recently decided to go back to my South Philly roots (um yeah not really) and I'm going to start using the phrase "smacked ass," which is an extremely popular saying in South Philly. Instead of just calling someone an ass, you call them a smacked ass. It's much better. Just think about it. It's just so much more satisifying. Just look...  "You're an ass" "You're a smacked ass"  The second one is clearly superior.

Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me  (Happy Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying "I Love You" I meant it Now I know what a fool I've been But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again  CHORUS  (Oooh. Oooh Baby)  A crowded room, friends with tired eyes I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice My God I thought you were someone to rely on Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Oooh Oooh Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again  CHORUS  A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (Gave you my heart) A man undercover but you tore me apart Next year I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special special someone someone I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special who'll give me something in return I'll give it to someone hold my heart and watch it burn I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special I've got you here to stay I can love you for a day I thought you were someone special gave you my heart I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone last christmas I gave you my heart you gave it away I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone  ok, I don't care if this song is by Wham. It's amazing. And I've had it stuck in my head all day. Like half the school had it stuck in their head all day, it was insane. And then as soon as we got in the car driving home it came on the radio. It was amazing. If I see you on the street, I  will  start singing this to you. I'll expect you to sing along.

      I've come to another conclusion. Math sucks an ass. Most of it is useless. I will never need to know if a train leaves from Dallas and another train leaves from Chicago where and when will they collide and how many people will die in the wreckage. You know why? Because they have seperate tracks, and no one cares.

      Florida: A thief burst into the bank one day wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun.  Aiming his gun at the guard, the thief yelled, "FREEZE, MOTHER-STICKERS, THIS IS A FUCK-UP!" For a moment, everyone was silent.  Then the snickers started.  The guard completely lost it and doubled over laughing.  It probably saved his life, because  he'd been about to draw his gun.  He couldn't have drawn and fired before the thief got him. The thief ran away and is still at large.  In memory of the event, the bank later put a plaque on the wall engraved "Freeze, mother-stickers, this is a fxxk-up!"  Once again, I love the Darwin Awards.

      The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan, at 5 a.m., flashed a gun, and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away.     I love the Darwin Awards.

        I am Nothing!    urlLink     Which Enemy of the Christian Church Are You?     urlLink Take More of Robert & Tim's Quizzes   urlLink Watch Robert & Tim's Cartoons       alright. this makes me really angry. first of all, I have definite opinions about religion and i don't just agree with whoever seems to come out on top. I have my own opinion thank you. Second of all, i just A LOT of though into the meaning of life and the abortion issue (or pro-death as you called it, pretty inacurately). Third of all, i don't think it's all that easy to convert adament non-christians. And many scientists and philosophers are christian. You can't just bombard an atheist with "evidence" and think they'll convert, just as an atheist can't bombard a christian with their beliefs and expect them to give up their religion. And in fact most christians have been turned off christianity because of the set-up of the religion itself.   ok. calm it down now. Sorry, got a little carried away. Point is, many things wrong with the results of that quiz.

      Behind the Wall- Tracy Chapman  Last night I heard the screaming Loud vioces behind the wall Another sleepless night for me It won't do no good to call The police Always come late If they came at all  Last night I heard the screaming Loud vioces behind the wall Another sleepless night for me It won't do no good to call The police Always come late If they came at all  And when they arrive They say they can't interfere With domestic affairs Between a man and his wife And as they walk out the door The tears well up in her eyes  Last night I heard the screaming Then a silence that chilled my soul I prayed that I was dreaming When I saw the ambulance in the road  And the policeman said I'm here to keep the peace Will the crowd disperse I think we all could use some sleep  Last night I heard the screaming Loud vioces behind the wall Another sleepless night for me It won't do no good to call The police Always come late If they came at all

      Forced to go out to dinner with family tonight. Here's the summary:  Low Points: - was with family - had to wait AN HOUR AND A HALF for a table - during hour and a half waiting got to walk around mall looking at stuff I couldn't buy because didn't bring money because didn't expect to be waiting for, say it with me, an hour and a half - walked around mall with family - when finally got table waited an hour for food - waiter was crossbreed Jamie Oliver and Freddie Prinz Jr. and perky to boot - had about three options on menu to choose from that didn't have meat in some form (as predicted) - Dad complained about cold fish or something but then refused to take free meal or get it warmed up. Point? none. - had to make run for the car since was 18 degrees outside and units decided would be smart to park in bumblefuck  Highlights: - saw really REALLY great shoes ON SALE, is likely will go back asap - when dad complained about cold fish, seemed to break perky waiter's spirit. Très amusant. - one waiter looked exactly like Jeff from Coupling and seemed to have personality to match. - Manicotti was really good. - dad's food was cold. bahaha. - after we ordered our food our waiter said, AND I QUOTE, "ah, great. I love you guys.", downside: had to refrain from responding "we're not into that"

      24.	Person X: "You've got great nostrils." You       -smile and say, "Thank you so much."       -say, "Oh…thanks"       -roll your eyes in disgust       -propose to them and then nostril-kiss them   ok that is the last one. I PROMISE. It was just so funny.

      18. You realize you've spilled hot wing sauce on your shirt, so you       -wipe it off with a napkin       -rush to the bathroom to get a wet paper towel      -lick it off suggestively  19.	Person X smiles and winks at you. You       -wink back       -titter with embarrassment       -assume they have some sort of facial tic  20.	Person X: "So, um, what do you do for a living?" You tell them       -the name of your company and your position at that company       -just the industry you work in       -that you are a race car driver by trade, blacksmith by circumstance  HOW DO THEY DO IT!

      Fast Car- Tracy Chapman  You got a fast car I want a ticket to anywhere Maybe we make a deal Maybe together we can get somewhere Anyplace is better Starting from zero got nothing to lose Maybe we'll make something But me myself I got nothing to prove  You got a fast car And I got a plan to get us out of here I been working at the convenience store Managed to save just a little bit of money We won't have to drive too far Just 'cross the border and into the city You and I both can get jobs And finally see what it means to be living  You see my old man's got a problem He live with the bottle that's the way it is He says his body's too old for working I say his body's too you to look like his My mama went off and left him She wanted more from life than he could give I said somebody's got to take care of him So I quit school and that's what I did  You got a fast car But is it fast enough so we can fly away We gotta make a decision We leave tonight or live and die this way  I remember we were driving driving in your car The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged And I had a feeling I could be someone be someone  be someone  You got a fast car And we go cruising to entertain ourselves You still ain't got a job And I work in a market as a checkout girl I know things will get better You'll find work and I'll get promoted We'll move out of the shelter Buy a big house and live in the suburbs  You got fast car And I got a job that pays our bills You stay out drinking late at the bar See more of your friends than you do of your kids I'd always hoped for better Thought maybe together you and me would find it I got no plans I ain't going nowhere So take your fast car and keep on driving  You got a fast car But is it fast enough so you can fly away You gotta make a decision You leave tonight or live and die this way

      You know how when you spend four plus hours with your family you die a little inside? yeah. My parents forced us all to go and see Lord of the Rings. Once again it took everything I had not to laugh through. the. entire. movie. Here are some highlights I missed or forgot about since the last time i saw it. 1. "I can feel his blade"- Frodo 2. "We can share the load *share the load echos over and over again for way too long*"- Sam 3. There are no straight people in that movie 4. Pippin gets raped by pretty much everyone, especially Gandalf 5. That random guys runs off a cliff while being on fire which can only lead to one reaction everyone in the theater going "WHAT?!" 6. In the beginning that hobbit thing has a fishing pole right at his crotch and it's sticking like staight up in the air and he says "I've got one!"  I'm sure they're is more but that's all i can remember now.  oh yeah then my parents looked around forever for some place to eat out while the whole time i'm like "why don't we just go home and eat" and they kept telling me "no, we want to eat out and I don't want to cook tonight." and i'm like "we can all make our own food we've done it before" we ended up not eating out, coming home, and making our own food. I chose not to say "i told you so"

      Oh yeah, I was talking to Noelle about my creepy boss and her Dad knows him through some random connection. Yeah so she told me why he was defrocked. Because he stole from the church and used to have parties with young girls. A.K.A. he's a fucking pedophile. I'm fucking quitting. He already kind of hits on me as is, and I don't know if he'll try anything. But I really don't want to wait and find out.

I've been chewing this same piece since I left my house this morning and it still hasn't lost flavor. Yay. Oh god I'm talking about gum. How sad. That signifies true boredom. Last night I stayed up till 2 doing my psychology project and surprisingly I'm not tired at all. I wasn't last night either. Maybe it's some kind of chemical imbalance. Oh vell.

      I made up that Let test today from like two months ago. I got like the first 30 questions no problem. And then I couldn't remember a damn thing. After a bit I kind of just stopped reading the questions. So I just made designs with the dots. Oh well. I think I did pretty well for not studying at all. Oh yeah speaking of tests. I think I did well on the Radzius test, which probably means I got an F. but I can dream can't I?

      Ok I was running on the theory that the school week was unbearably long and painful because I didn't have enough sleep, but I was asleep by 10 last night (which is pretty sad, but I really needed the sleep, plus my parents went psycho and decided to degrade me from um being normal and going to bed when I feel like it to my nine year old sister's bedtime of 9:30, but whatever I'll get into that some other time) but anyway, yeah. I was well rested I got up almost without a problem this morning. (meaning i was conscious when taking a shower) but today STILL seemed unbearably long and I can't believe it's only Tuesday. GAHHHH. Not cool.

       Lola - The Kinks  I met her in a club down in North Soho where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Cherry Cola C-O-L-A Cola. She walked up to me and she asked me to dance. I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola" L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy, but when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand why she walk like a woman but talk like a man Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Well, we drank champagne and danced all night, under electric candlelight, she picked me up and sat me on her knee, She said, "Little boy won't you come home with me?" Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy, but when I looked in her eyes, I almost fell for my Lola, Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola I pushed her away. I walked to the door. I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees. I looked at her, and she at me. Well that's the way that I want it to stay. always I always want it to be that way for my Lola. Lo lo lo Lola. Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls. It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world, except for Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Well I left home just a week before, and I never ever kissed a woman before, but Lola smiled and took me by the hand, she said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man." Well I'm not the world's most masculine man, but I know what I am and in bed I'm a man, so is Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. etc.

      For the first time in my life I actually want to like go to a dance. I just got this really random urge while listening to American Woman (Lenny Kravitz style) to dance, in public, with other people dancing. It was really weird. Maybe I'm sick. Hmm... Anyway, maybe if I ignore it it'll go away.

      "What if you dove in the pool and while you were at the bottom of the pool freaking out, somebody poured oil on the surface and lit it on fire. Then you're like 'OOH OOH AHH!!!'. You gatta just keep swimming around feeling for a spot where there's no fucking fire. Then what if you found a circle where there was no fire, but the second you came up a big dude just punched you in the face. 'Get back in the firey water. You don't come out of the firey water. Cover up that whole with some fire, now. GET BACK IN THE FIREY WATER'"   "If got to a house and it was fully on fire, Fuck that. I quit. I would just stand outside and watch it burn with everyone else. And the woman next to me would be like 'Please my son! He's screaming in there.' I'd be like 'Well he's probably on fire.'"   Both from Dane Cook. Incredible.

      meh, school. I had a doctor's appointment today so I got to miss the Reach training today. Yay. Downside: I had to go to the doctors. I hate going there. 'Cause every time they tell me that I'm not going to grow anymore, which is true, but they don't need to keep pointing it out. Like "You're in the 28th percentile for your height. That means almost 80% of the girls your age are taller than you. YOU'RE SHORT!!!" Ok well that last part was an exageration, almost. But then they're like "and you're in the 70% percentile for your weight." great, that's only what? 40% difference. yeah. And the doctor goes "since you're not going to get any taller you need to focus on your diet because the only way you're going to grow now is around." And she like looked at my stomach. Which I thought was a little hypocritical coming from her, who let's just say was... No. I'm bad at analogies. She was just fat.

      ok just imagine when they say job or boss that they are really saying school and teacher, and then it's like "wow that's how i feel everyday in school" it's uncanny.  Shove This Jay-Oh-Bee- Canibus with Biz Markie  [Canibus] Yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning To the sound of your alarm clock alarm About an hour from now You should be at the place of employment Which is annoying cause it's so boring Your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them It affects your occupational performance You wonder why your work load is so enormous Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office People get depressed, they get ulcers From the stress that the corporate environment causes Regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this Seems to me like you've got one of four choices: You could take a new job offer for more chips Stick it out a little longer or forfeit But my advice to anybody that wants to quit It'll feel much better if you say it like this:  [Biz Markie] Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it  [Canibus] Yo, if your boss is a S-O-B Tell him to S-H-O-V-E the J-O-B Put your middle finger up slowly Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely Say I ain't workin here no more Who do you think you are? Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor Run to the door, to the payphone Make a toll-free call Tell your spouse what happened and where you are So they can come and get you in the car later on And help you search for a new 9 to 5 job If the unemployment line ain't that long You can take your time printin out W-9 forms Eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough And you'll get money if you keep punchin your time card enough Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to  [Biz Markie] Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it  [Canibus] Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs The boss is favored and get placed in something spacious While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces Or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated You constantly waitin for a paycheck Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet Here's a optimistic motto If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow Most 9 to 5's are hard  cause the description in the job ain't no picnic in the park People get hired Drink coffee to stay wired So they don't get tired, sleep late, and get fired  [Biz Markie] You came in late, you already ate,  nowww, you wanna take a lunch break!??!  [Canibus] Ay, yo bust it, ain't no need to discuss it Just take this job and shove it, right between your buttocks  [Biz Markie] Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it  Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Ah Ah ah ah ahahah ah I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Ay Ay Ay ayee ay I ain't workin here no more  Canibus and the Biz It's comin from Canibus and the Biz It's comin from Canibus and the Biz From, from Canibus and the Biz

      wow, i was just looking at the dress code in the assignment book to see if there really was anything against pajama pants in there and under "distraction from teaching or learning" it lists "bare midriff or shoulders" Ok when has bare shoulders ever distracted ANYONE from doing ANYTHING past like 1895. How does that even make sense? Like you you see someone's stomach or shoulders are you automatically drawn off subject. Like "The DNA strands split at this point and... OH MY GOD BARE SHOULDERS! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FOCUS NOW!"

      I clicked on that "how long can you hold the button" thing on laurel's blog. I stopped after thirty-some seconds upon realizing how unbelievably pathetic it was.  Sadder: I actually beat 4.8% of the people time-wise. The fact that I beat anyone is just really bad (as in I shouldn't have played long enough to beat even 4.8%)  even sadder: when I let go the record came up, and it was like eleven days and something. ELEVEN DAYS! doesn't that make you sad for that person. It makes me sad.

Maybe I'll just move to England.

       urlLink This editorial made me SO angry    Alright there were several things wrong with that article. Here are some main points of rage for me:  1. the author (who refuses to admit who he/she is hmm.) says that bush should be loyal to his friends in making sure that he was listening to them. Um did I miss something. 'Cause last time I check the president's job was to protect the rights of the citizens of the united states. ALL of the citizens. Including gay and lesbian citizens.  2. defending traditional marriage? WHAT?! first of all how does that make sense AT ALL. How is giving gay and lesbian people the right to be married destroying any hetero marriages. Um, gay people being married is NOT going to affect the ligitmacy of a straight marriage. If the author means that gays being allowed to marry is going to taint traditional marriage well there is something SEVERELY wrong with that in itself.  3. Bush's christian beliefs should have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with making a fucking AMENDMENT in the constitution. What happened to religious freedom. Yeah remember that?! This is NOT a theocracy! Bush's own personal morals should have nothing to do with his law making decisions. Laws and amendments are meant to PROTECT the rights of the citizens, not take them away. They are made for the good of the citizens based on what is beneficial for them. NOT how Bush or the Christian thinks it SHOULD be.   There is  a lot  more I want to comment on but if I make it too long no one will read it. Hell you guys probably won't read it now as long as it is. To be honest, I wouldn't.

      Evaporated- Ben Folds Five  What I've kept with me And what I've thrown away And where the hell I've ended up On this glary random day Were the things I really cared about Just left along the way For being too pent up and proud Woke up way too late Feeling hung over and old And the sun was shining bright And I walked barefoot down the road Started thing about my old man It seems that all men Wanna get into a car and go anywhere  Here I stand, Sad & free I can't cry and I can't see What I've done God...What have I done So don't you know I'm numb, man No I don't feel a thing at all Cause its all smiles & business these days and I am indifferent to the loss I've faith that there's a soul whose leading me around I wonder if she knows Which way is down... I poured my heart out I poured my heart out it evaporated...see?  Blind man on a canyon's edge of a Panoramic scene Or maybe I'm a kite That's flying high & random Dangling a string Or slumped over in a vacant room Head on a stranger's knee I'm sure back home They think I've lost my mind.

      I love those fake commercials on SNL that spoof the Vegas commercials and they're like "whatever happens in thailand, stays in thailand" and they have some guy calling some other guy and he's like "yeah i woke up in the closet and my hooker's dead i need the number of that guy." it's high quality.

      wow um... I just got a flyer for a church thing and it has a list of like all these surmons. One of them is "What Held Jesus to the Cross?" and under it says "Love can be so strong that nothing else matters"  Love huh, now I was under the impression it was nails. Question: Wouldn't love then release him from the cross, not you know, keep him there?  Gatta love those badly worded church flyers that people shove in my door. Well no, not really, but it was funny.

      Can't Help Falling In Love- Elvis Presley  Wise men say only fools rush in but I can't help falling in love with you  Shall I stay would it be a sin? if I can't help  falling in love with you  Like a river flows surely to the sea darling, so it goes some things are meant to be  Take my hand Take my whole life too For I can't help falling in love with you  Like a river flows surely to the sea darling, so it goes some things are meant to be  Take my hand Take my whole life too For I can't help falling in love with you  For I can't help falling in love with you

      I've decided that if I do get married I want to get married in a Vegas chapel by an Elvis impersonater. It just seems more honest. There's no one else there but the person you want to be with the rest of your life, or at least until the hang over wears off, and it really is about you, not about the production. Much more honest.

      I ordered the complete first and second season of coupling last night. I'm so excited, but I was cheap and didn't want to pay for the shipping and handling so i took the "super saver discount" so it's not coming for like another week.  But still. Excited.

      watched Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion and Young Frankenstein at madeline's tonight. Both those movies are fucking hilarious. Highlights: Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion: "He could barely contain his erection every time she was around. Why do you think he always carried that huge notebook?" "This dress exacerbates the genetic betrayel that is my legacy" "-Has anybody told you that smoking can kill you?  -No, no one. Thank you!" "Let's fold scarves" "-Swear to God, sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.  -Do you want to try, to see if we are?  -What? Yeah, right, Michelle. Just the idea of having sex with another woman creeps me out. But if we're still single at 30, ask me again.  -Okay." "I hope your babies look like monkeys!" "Ramone quit jerking off and bring the car around!" "Come. Let me make it up to you. I have boxes of Kleenex in my limo." "-I'm so glad you didn't bring your big notebook. -Michelle!" "Would you excuse me? I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood. *limps away*"  there are more but now onto... Young Frankenstein: "Sedagive?!?!" "That's Fronk-en-steen" "Nice hopping" "Vould you like to roll in ze hay? Roll roll roll in ze hay" "-What knockers -Thank you doctor" "-He's going to have an enormous schvanstuker  -That goes without saying.  -OOF!  -He's going to be very popular" "We must accept this as all things, with quiet dignity and grace. YOU SON OF A BITCH BASTARD! I'LL KILL YOU! I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE! I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE!! " "Wait! Where are you going? I was gonna make espreso." "destiny, destiny, no escaping thats for me!" "-Werewolf!  - Werewolf?  - There wolf, there castle! -Why are you talking that way? -I thought you wanted to. -I don't want to. -Suit yourself, I'm easy." "-Elevate me.  -Right here?" "- It's moments like these, I remember what my old dad used to say to me.  - Oh yes? What did he say?  - What are DOING spending all your time in the BATHROOM for!! Why don't you give someone else a go!"  incredible.

      Best Imitation Of Myself- Ben Folds  I feel like a quote out of context Withholding the rest So I can be for you what you want to see I got the gesture and sound Got the timing down It's uncanny, yeah, you think it was me Do you think I should take a class To lose my Southern accent Did I make me up, or make the face till it stuck I do the best imitation of myself The 'problem with you' speech You gave me was fine I liked the theories about my little stage And I swore I was listening But I started drifting Around the part about me acting my age Now if it's all the same I've people to entertain I juggle one-handed Do some magic tricks and The best imitation of myself Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole Wondering, who I am when I ought to know Straighten up now time to go Fool somebody else, fool somebody else Last night I was east with them And west within Trying to be for you what you wanna see But I can't help it with you The good and bad comes through Don't want you hanging out with No one but me Now if it's all the same It comes from the same place And if my mind's somewhere else You won't be able to tell I do the best imitation of myself Yes it's uncanny to see You'd really think it was me The best imitation of myself Do the best imitation of myself

       No-Makeup Look Easier To Achieve Than Elle Claims  NEW YORK—Contrary to claims in the June issue of Elle magazine, the no-makeup look actually requires little effort, a licensed cosmetologist reported Monday. "The article '20 Minutes To A More Natural You' suggests an application of under-eye concealer, light powder, natural lip gloss, and clear mascara to achieve the makeup-free look," said Michelle Karns-Daley, spokeswoman for the American Association of Cosmetology. "But really, a quick shower and a towel-off will do the trick just as well." Similarly, experts say Elle's six-page article "Building Your Self-Esteem" can be more simply stated as "Stop giving a shit about what people think."   from The Onion

      On the Valley Forge field trip I took a picture of this crazy woman trying to walk her cat but it wasn't having any of that so it was more like she was dragging her cat on a leash. It was hilarious. I just enlarged that picture today. It's the best picture I've ever taken. Well, actually it's grainy and there are all kinds of scratches on the negative but the subject alone just makes it incredible. Everytime I look at it, it makes me laugh. I'm gonna carry this picture with me everywhere so that everytime something is crap I can look at it, and life will be better. I'll scan it and put it up here later, and then you'll see.

      The Weakness In Me- Joan Armatrading  I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love  But to you, I give my affection, right from the start.  I have a lover who loves me - how could I break such a heart?  Yet still you get my attention.   Why do you come here, when you know I've got troubles enough?  Why do you call me, when you know I can't answer the phone?  And make me lie when I don't want to,  And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool?  Make me stay when I should not?  If you're so strong then resolve the weakness in me.  Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by?  I need to see you - I need to hold you - tightly.   Feeling guilty,  And I'm worried, and I'm waking from a tormented sleep  'Cause this old love, you know it has me bound,  But this new love cuts so deep.  If I choose now, I'm bound to lose out;  One of you is gonna have to fall...  I need you, baby.   Why do you come here, when you know I've got troubles enough?  Why do you call me, when you know I can't answer the phone?  And make me lie when I don't want to,  And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool?  Make me stay when I should not?  If you're so strong then resolve the weakness in me.  Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by?  I need to see you - I need to hold you - tightly.

       7-Year-Old Asshole Demands You King Him  COS COB, CT—On the 23rd turn of the game Monday, 7-year-old asshole Andy Scot advanced a checker to the opposite end of the board and plunked it down on a black square. "King me," the smug little bastard said, folding his pudgy arms across his sweater-vested chest. "Do it." The checkers game, which continued apace after you placed a checker on top of his, was at least a reprieve from hearing the little shit say "sorry" during the game of the same name.   I love The Onion, and I've babysat that kid.

And I was trying to get transferred back to penncrest or something and I ended up smacking a bunch of people then I got to go home. Best part was that at one point we were all dressed as pilgrims. It was crazy.

      Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, And think of you Caught up in circles confusion Is nothing new Flashback warm nights Almost left behind Suitcases of memories, Time after  Sometimes you picture me  I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me, I can't hear What you've said  Then you say go slow  I fall behind  The second hand unwinds If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting  Time after time If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting  Time after time After my picture fades and darkness has  Turned to gray Watching through windows you're wondering If I'm OK Secrets stolen from deep inside The drum beats out of time  If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting  Time after time You said go slow  I fall behind The second hand unwinds  If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting  Time after time If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting  Time after time Time after time Time after time Time after time

      p.s. went to see the concert event of the year last night: Ben Folds was a god, Rufus Wainright wore the gayest shoes I've ever seen in my life and forgot the words to his own songs (needless to say, I loved him), and Guster sucked ass.

      I am tired beyond all reason. I went to bed at three last night and mom woke me up at ten to pack. What a crazed maniac. I was so out of it I forgot how to spell "sixty". Yeah, pretty bad. It just makes me think though, that's how much sleep I got every day during the school year. How did I pass?

      I just saw Fahrenheit 9/11. Wow. That was the most powerful, upsetting, and enraging movie I've ever seen. I cried almost through the whole thing. If you hate Bush you should definitely see it, it supports everything you believe. If you like Bush you need to see it even more than the liberals. It'll definitely change your mind.

      Baseball is the worst game of all time. Not nearly enough violence (they don't even use the bats to hit eachother. What's the point?), and it goes on  forever . My dad dragged the whole family to a baseball game last night with the promise of fireworks. He made us get there TWO HOURS early so we could walk around and see the new stadium and the game started at 7... and ended at 1:15 AM. 16 mother fucking innings. Six hours and fifteen minutes. Plus we were there two hours early. Plus the fireworks were like 40 minutes. I was at that goddamn ballpark for nine fucking hours AND THEY LOST. GAH! And the guys sitting behind us were the dumbest people on the planet. No joke. And they were loud too, so I caught this little snippet of their conversation... "What was the name of the beach they stormed on D-Day" "Normandy" "No, that was the name of the country. What was the name of the  beach " "oh, I don't know man."  OH MY GOD  There are so many things wrong with that, 1. why the fuck are you talking about world war 2?  2. why are you so stupid? etc.  anyway at least the fireworks were good, despite the fact they played every possible song that even mentions "America" or "U.S.A."  that's nine hours spent with my family watching the most boring sport in the universe (including curling and the games we play in gym) that I will never get back.  I'm so bitter

      "And it didn't seem right to be discussing fatherhood with a naked gay man in a bath."   I defy you to find a better quote.

      quote of the day:   "don't worry, we'll be in rehoboth soon, not being ass raped by boredom"- Anna    That is the best metaphor I've ever heard in my life.

      Cigarettes and chocolate milk These are just a couple of my cravings Everything it seems I like’s a little bit stronger A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me If I should buy jellybeans Have to eat them all in just one sitting Everything it seems I like’s a little bit sweeter A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me And then there’s those other things Which for several reasons we won’t mention Everything about ’em is a little bit stranger, a little bit harder A little bit deadly It’s not very smart Tends to make one part So brokenhearted Sitting here remembering me Always been a shoe made for the city Go ahead accuse me of just singing about places With scrappy boys faces have general run of the town Playing with prodigal sons Take a lot of sentimental valiums Can’t expect the world to be your raggedy andy While running on empty you little old doll with a frown You got to keep in the game Retaining mystique while facing forward I suggest a reading of lesson in tightropes Or surfing your high hopes or adios kansas It’s not very smart Tends to make one part So brokenhearted Still there’s not a show on my back Holes or a friendly intervention I’m just a little bit heiress, a little bit irish A little bit tower of pisa Whenever I see ya So please be kind if I’m a mess Cigarettes and chocolate milk Cigarettes and chocolate milk

      August is like Sunday. It's still technically vacation but it's tainted because you know you have to go back to school soon.
