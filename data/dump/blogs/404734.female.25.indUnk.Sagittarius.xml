       A simple look at us...tayo ba ititch?    THE YOUNG PERSON'S GUIDE TO THE CHORUS   In any chorus, there are four voice parts: soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Sometimes these are divided into first and second within each part, prompting endless jokes about first and second basses. There are also various other parts such as baritone, countertenor, contralto, mezzo soprano, etc., but these are mostly used by people who are either soloists, or belong to some excessively hotshot classical a cappella group (this applies especially to countertenors), or are trying to make excuses for not really fitting into any of the regular voice parts, so we will ignore them for now.  Each voice part sings in a different range, and each one has a very different personality. You may ask, "Why should singing different notes make people act differently?", and indeed this is a mysterious question and has not been adequately studied, especially since scientists who study musicians tend to be musicians themselves and have all the peculiar complexes that go with being tenors, french horn players, timpanists, or whatever. However, this is beside the point; the fact remains that the four voice parts can be easily distinguished, and I will now explain how.   THE SOPRANOS  are the ones who sing the highest, and because of this they think they rule the world. They have longer hair, fancier jewelry, and swishier skirts than anyone else, and they consider themselves insulted if they are not allowed to go at least to a high F in every movement of any given piece. When they reach the high notes, they hold them for at least half again as long as the composer and/or conductor requires, and then complain that their throats are killing them and that the composer and conductor are sadists. Sopranos have varied attitudes toward the other sections of the chorus, though they consider all of them inferior.   ALTOS  are to sopranos rather like second violins to first violins - nice to harmonize with, but not really necessary. All sopranos have a secret feeling that the altos could drop out and the piece would sound essentially the same, and they don't understand why anybody would sing in that range in the first place - it's so boring.    TENORS , on the other hand, can be very nice to have around; besides  their flirtation possibilities (it is a well-known fact that sopranos never flirt with basses), sopranos like to sing duets with tenors because all the tenors are doing is working very  hard to sing in a low-to-medium soprano range, while the sopranos are up there in the stratosphere showing off. To sopranos,  BASSES  are the scum of the earth - they sing too damn loud, are useless to tune to because they're down in that low, low range - and there has to be something wrong with anyone who sings in the F clef, anyway (although while they swoon while the Tenors sing, they still end up going home with the basses).   THE ALTOS  are the salt of the earth - in their opinion, at least. Altos are unassuming people, who would wear jeans to concerts if they were allowed to. Altos are in a unique position in the chorus in that they are unable to complain about having to sing either very high or very low, and they know that all the other sections think their parts are pitifully easy. But the altos know otherwise. They know that while the sopranos are screeching away on a high A, they are being forced to sing elaborate passages full of sharps and flats and tricks of rhythm, and nobody is noticing because the sopranos are singing too loud (and the basses usually are, too). Altos get a deep, secret pleasure out of conspiring together to tune the sopranos flat. Altos have an innate distrust of tenors, because the tenors sing in almost the same range and think they sound better. They like the basses, and enjoy singing duets with them - the basses just sound like a rumble anyway, and it's the only time the altos can really be heard. Altos' other complaint is that there are always too many of them and so they never get to sing really loud.   THE TENORS  are spoiled. That's all there is to it. For one thing, there are never enough of them, and choir directors would rather sell their souls than let a halfway decent tenor quit, while they're always ready to unload a few altos at half price. And then, for some reason, the few tenors there are always really good - it's one of those annoying facts of life. So it's no wonder that tenors always get swollen heads - after all, who else can make sopranos swoon? The one thing that can make tenors insecure is the accusation (usually by the basses) that anyone singing that high couldn't possibly be a real man. In their usual perverse fashion, the tenors never acknowledge this, but just complain louder about the composer being a sadist and making them sing so damn high. Tenors have a love-hate relationship with the conductor, too, because the conductor is always telling them to sing louder because there are so few of them. No conductor in recorded history has ever asked for less tenor in a forte passage.  Tenors feel threatened in some way by all the other sections - the sopranos because they can hit those incredibly high notes; the altos because they have no trouble singing the notes the tenors kill themselves for; and the basses because, although they can't sing anything above an E, they sing it loud enough to drown the tenors out. Of course, the tenors would rather die than admit any of this. It is a little-known fact that tenors move their eyebrows more than anyone else while singing.   THE BASSES  sing the lowest of anybody. This basically explains everything. They are stolid, dependable people, and have more facial hair than anybody else. The basses feel perpetually unappreciated, but they have a deep conviction that they are actually the most important part (a view endorsed by musicologists, but certainly not by sopranos or tenors), despite the fact that they have the most boring part of anybody and often sing the same note (or in endless fifths) for an entire page. They compensate for this by singing as loudly as they can get away with - most basses are tuba players at heart. Basses are the only section that can regularly complain about how low their part is, and they make horrible faces when trying to hit very low notes. Basses are charitable people, but their charity does not extend so far as tenors, whom they consider effete poseurs. Basses hate tuning the tenors more than almost anything else. Basses like altos - - except when they have duets and the altos get the good part. As for the sopranos, they are simply in an alternate universe which the basses don't understand at all. They can't imagine why anybody would ever want to sing that high and sound that bad when they make mistakes. When a bass makes a mistake, the other three parts will cover him, and he can continue on his merry way, knowing that sometime, somehow, he will end up at the root of the chord.

      YoUr FrIeNdShIp Is A gIfT...  Each of us has a hidden place  Somewhere deep within ourselves;  A place where we go to get away,  To think things through,  To be alone, to be ourselves.   This unique place, where we confront our deepest feelings,  Becomes a storehouse of all our hopes,  all our needs, all our dreams,  and even our unspoken fears.  It encompasses the essence of who we are and what we want to be.   But now and then, whether by chance or design,  someone discovers a way into that place we thought was ours alone.  And we allow that person to see, to feel and to share  all the reason, all the uncertainty  and all the emotion we've stored up there.   That person adds new perspective to our hidden realm,  then quietly settles down in his own corner of our special place,  Where a bit of himself will stay forever.   And we call that person a friend.    22o naman po ito db?Ü

       TBS.   Masaya ang naging huling Team Building Seminar ng choir...agree? Sana nakatulong makabuo ng team spirit. In a nutshell, ito ang major points:                       **Paint Me A Picture - deciphering team mechanics to understand how our group works                       **Iceberg Theory - the behaviour symptoms of each of the member reveal little of our 'real' selves                       **Letter Writing - ang pagbahagi ng pagkakakilanlan sa isa't-isa, mabuti o masama                       **Sharing - siyempre tungkol sa mga natutunan.     Nakatulong ang mga 'exam' ni Bro. Munch. Masyadong komplikado yung iba kaya sa amin na lang yun...nye! O, heto na ang ilang mga kuha sa bwiset kong camera. hindi kasi kodak yung film, sensya na.            Pagmasdan niyo si James, na-tsansingan na si Patot. Si Eric, as usual, tulog nanaman sa picture. Si V1, parang bold star sa likod.       Buti nga hindi nakita yung mga nag-posing habang session, he,he.

Maganda ang feedback ng mga tao, ultimong Jose Mari Chan ay all-praises sa performance na kahit hinihimatay na sa pagod ang mga tao ay mega-emote pa rin. Kwela ang kwela part namin, when we danced to the last part of Jingle Bells at nice choreo sa Kumukutikutitap (and taba, este ang laki ng palarang bituin namin...si Jerome). i think the films are not used up yet so abangan ang mga pictures!

       Courtesy call!       Sino ba namang mag-aakalang makikilala namin si Pres. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo sa isang gabi ng pangangaroling? Aktuali, the probability of us meeting her was big kasi we were requested by Fr. D. Huang, SJ to sing at a mass for Luli and her college friends at the Malacanang Palace chapel. Syempre, binida kami ni dear Fr. kaya napa-karoling na kami in front of Madame President herself. Kung ayaw niyo maniwala, maghintay lang kayo dahil may pruweba kami! Wait for the pictures of us and the Palace...  nangyari ito sa bday ni  Jayson.  at nag-solo ng One Small Child ang lolo mo sa harap ni Madam Pres. bago pa ito, nanggaling kami sa Muntinlupa at nag-mini concert sa Minimum Camp. late ng 1 & 1/2 oras ang transpo namin kaya we didn't make it for the 3 p.m. cut off time of visitors sa Maximum (olthough ok para sa akin yun kasi mukhang mas ok ang mga mukha ng taga-Minimum kaysa Maximum). at bago pa nito, nag-praktis ng choreo and blocking ang ilang tao para sa 1st general rehearsal mamyang gabi...gosh, mamyang gabi na!  1:30 a.m. na kami nakauwi. after malacanang we ate dinner muna...buti nakakain pa kami kasi muntik nang ma-lost ni Mr. Coordinator ang perang inabot ni Ms. Luli Arroyo. Kung magkano ang laman, sikreto!!! after another McDo dinner, rumatsada pa papuntang Taytay para sa contact ni Jerome. it was the perfect bachelor's pad. sobrang aliw, motif: black & white with a touch of silver. looks really modern, the furnitures and stuff was bought for the style. may picture naman uli kami dun so wait uli kayo.   may mga taong matatag na nakasimba pa ng 4:30 a.m. na simbang gabi matapos ng lahat ng ititch. grabe na to! kailangan may medalya sila sa tatag ng mga katawan at kaluluwa nila!!!

Red bull!   hanga ako sa mga hindi pa nagde-day off ever simula ng caroling ( i hope i didn't forget anyone!): Willan, Upeng, Patot, Eric, Jayson, Mitch...di ko sure si Onang at V1. sa pangalawang linggo ng caroling non-stop ay malapit na ko plumakda! ang nakakapagpabuhay lang ay ang mga taong mainit na tinatanggap kami sa kanilang mga tahanan at ang mga nakaka-appreciate at nachi-chika namin. hindi mababayaran ang ngiti ni Fr. Honti the great na bumaba pa sa kanyang kwarto para lang marining ang bagong henerasyon ng Barangka Choir, ang mga palakpak at "Ang ganda!" o "Ang galing!" ni Fr. Vic DJ, ang mga pakikipagkamay ng mga taga EAPI na foreigners para sabihing they were honored to have been shared the spirit of Christmas, yung huling bahay sa SSS na may masarap na spaghetti at may masayang pamilya na kinarir ni james... :)  don't you agree?

Welcome to Em, Mitch, Tin, Lyn and Abbey! Inducted sila into the tradition, kung baga initiation. Carry naman, at nag-enjoy naman lahat kahit may kasamang mga 'elders' na cool na cool at proud to see us sing. Siyempre, kudos to James for brightening up the unfamilliar faces of the audiences!!! Kinarir nya ang bawat puntahan kaya everybody was put at ease. Sana ganito kasaya lagi. Kahit pagod masaya...abangan ang susunod na mga mangyayari!

      sa mga adik jan...   MGA SENYALES NA ADDICT KA NA SA METEOR GARDEN    *Ang Ringtone ng cellphone mo ay Qing Fei De Yi at sangkatutak ang picture messages mo na naglalaman ng mga pagmumukha ng mga F4. Pati logo mo ay meteor garden at kulang na lang pati casing mo ay F4. Naguguluhan ka na minsan sa cellphone mo dahil Chinese ang ginamit mong language. *Nagpagawa ka ng speaker para sa kotse mo na parang may mga megaphone na equipment sa labas. Gusto mo rin live ang sounds kaya pinipilit mo ang driver mo kumanta. *Ibinagsak ka ng professor mo dahil ginaya mo si Dao nung di niya sinasadyang maapakan ang paa mo. *Napapadalas ang pagse-sentimiyento mo sa rooftop *Napapadalas ang panonood mo ng Maalaala mo Kaya at mga Teleserye para masubukan mo kung effective nga yung technique ni Lei *Ipinagpalit mo ang kotse mo sa isang scooter *Nagtatalo kayo ng nanay mo dahil pinapagaya mo sa kanya ang napakagandang hairstyle nung nanay ni San Chai *Nag-aabang kang maimbitahan sa isang party dahil binabalak mong patayin ang ilaw para mahalikan ang crush mo *Nahihilig kang kumain ng mga kakaibang gulay, isda at kanin; pati kubyertos mo ay naiinip na sa estante dahil pinipilit mong mag-chopsticks. *Nagpilit kang mag-aral ng Chinese dahil nagpapantasya kang ma-meet ang F4 sa personal. (Mind you maraming Chinese dialects ) Ginagawa mo rin ito para naman di ka mukhang tangang kumakanta ng awiting di mo naman maunawaan. *Itinakwil mo halos lahat ng kaibigan mo at nagtira ka lang ng tatlo para apat kayo *Nilagyan mo ng karatulang You're Dead ang locker ng kaaway mo at kung di ka naman war freak, naghihintay kang malagyan ang locker mo nun *Ang World History at Geography Books mo na dati lang nabibulok sa bookshelf ay biglang nagkatupi-dun sa pages tungkol sa China o Taiwan *Di ka na nandidiri o nababaduyan sa ukay-ukay ngayon basta ba malapit sa binibilhan ng F4 poster sa bangketa. Inaway mo pa nga yung lolang umaagaw sa poster na nakuha mo na. *Isa ka sa mga nangungulit sa ABS-CBN na papuntahin ang F4 sa Pilipinas. Wala ka nang pakialam kung SARS infected man ang Republic of China *Bigla mo na lang kinainisan sila Paolo Bediones at Miriam Quiambao *Diskumpiyado ka dahil kalian man ay hindi mo malalagyan ng mga meteor ang garden niyo. *Sandamukal na mura na ang natanggap mo mula sa Rock fans ng UNTV nang mag-request ka ng kanta ng F4 sa Rock and Punk program nila *Wala ka nang ibang tatak ng bra na gusto kundi Chanel *Mas may pang-unawa ka na sa mga may down syndrome dahil kay Lei *Inireklamo ka sa barangay dahil bigla mong naisipan magpaputok sa madaling araw para mapansin ka ng mga anghel *Napapakunot ang noo sa iyo ng mga magulang mo dahil nagpapabili ka sa kanila ng barko *Nakatutok ka na sa tv kahit Magandang Umaga Bayan pa lang ang palabas. Baka kasi i-feature ang F4 o kaya naman ay takot kang maka-miss kahit isang buka ng bibg ng characters nito na minsan ay di tugma sa dubbing *Naunos ang printer cartridge mo kaka-print ng mga articles at photos ng F4 *BALAK MONG IPADALA O I PRINT ANG LISTAHANG ITO

       mukhang kailangan ng mga tao ito!.    THE TRIPLE FILTER TEST.   In ancient Greece, Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high esteem. One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said, "Do you know what I just heard about your friend?" "Hold on a minute," Socrates replied. "Before telling me anything I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test." "Triple filter?" "That's right," Socrates continued. "Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you're going to say. That's why I call it the triple filter test. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?" "No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and..." "All right," said Socrates. "So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?" "No, on the contrary... " "So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him, but you're not certain it's true. You may still pass the test though, because there's one filter left: the filter of usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?" "No, not really." "Well," concluded Socrates, "If what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?"  This is why Socrates was a great philosopher & held in such high esteem. Use this triple filter each time you hear loose talk about any of  your dear friends.

       December bdays.   Dec. 02 - Maan Dec. 15 - Jayson Cervantes Dec. 17 - Jenilyn  Happy birthday po! Sadyang hectic ang mga iskedyul ng mga pipol, pero hindi naman ito nalimutan.... ***** Picture alert!  urlLink Arrupe caroling  photos, just clink the colored link. Dyosko, ang mga fil na fil ang nguso ang tulis at ang mga matang nakapikit! Please post ur comments on tag board :) ********* ang mga mare't pare, pagod na ba kayo sa Pastoral caroling? Buti nga wala nang concert kundi patay-patay nanaman. sorry at hindi rin ako nagigising sa simbang gabi... hindi kaya ng amor powers ko!!! *****  A Christmas Letter.   As you well know, we are getting closer to my birthday. Every year there is a celebration in my honor and I think that this year the celebration will be repeated. During this time there are many people shopping for gifts, there are many radio announcements, TV commercials, and in every part of the world everyone is talking that my birthday is getting closer and closer.   It is really very nice to know, that at least once a year, some people think of me. As you know, the celebration of my birthday began many years ago. At first people seemed to understand and be thankful of all that I did for them, but in these times, no one seems to know the reason for the celebration. Family and friends get together and have a lot of fun, but they don't know the meaning of the celebration.   I remember that last year there was a great feast in my honor. The dinner table was full of delicious foods, pastries, fruits, assorted nuts and chocolates. The decorations were exquisite and there were many, many beautifully wrapped gifts. But, do you want to know something? I wasn't invited. I was the guest of honor and they didn't remember to send me an invitation. The party was for me, but when that great day came, I was left outside, they closed the door in my face .... and I wanted to be with them and share their table.   In truth, that didn't surprise me because in the last few years all close their doors to me. Since I wasn't invited, I decided to enter the party without making any noise. I went in and stood in a corner. They were all drinking; there were some who were drunk and telling jokes and laughing at everything. They were having a grand time. To top it all, this big fat man all dressed in red wearing a long white beard entered the room yelling Ho-Ho-Ho! He seemed drunk. He sat on the sofa and all the children ran to him, saying: "Santa Claus, Santa Claus" .. as if the party were in his honor!   At 12 Midnight all the people began to hug each other; I extended my arms waiting for someone to hug me and ... do you know ... no one hugged me. Suddenly they all began to share gifts. They opened them one by one with great expectation. When all had been opened, I looked to see if, maybe, there was one for me.   What would you feel if on your birthday everybody shared gifts and you did not get one? I then understood that I was unwanted at that party and quietly left.    Every year it gets worse. People only remember to eat and drink, the gifts, the parties and nobody remembers me. I would like this Christmas that you allow me to enter into your life. I would like that you recognize the fact that almost two thousand years ago I came to this world to give my life for you, on the cross, to save you. Today, I only want that you believe this with all your heart.   I want to share something with you. As many didn't invite me to their party, I will have my own celebration, a grandiose party that no one has ever imagined, a spectacular party.   I'm still making the final arrangements. Today I am sending out many invitations and there is an invitation for you. I want to know if you wish to attend and I will make a reservation for you and write your name with golden letters in my great guest book. Only those on the guest list will be invited to the party. Those who don't answer the invite, will be left outside.   Be prepared because when all is ready you will be part of my great party.   See you soon ... I Love you!   Jesus   Merry Christmas everyone! Jesus is the reason we are singing carols for!

      Please pray for the souls of Christine's mom and dad,  Ramon and Lina , who died only days apart this week :( ******* it's ironic that i'm celebrating my life and everyone is mourning the death of Mang Ramon. i really don't mind naman. i guess it's a stark reminder for me that every year that i celebrate my bday is a day where i could be thankful that i was given another year to live and feel blessed for everything. salamat sa lahat ng bumati! ******  joke,joke,joke time.   para naman hindi kayo masyado malungkot...  Wise camel   A mother and a baby camel were layingaround, and suddenly the baby  camel asked ....    Baby: Mother, mother, may I ask you some questions?    Mother: Sure! Why son, is there something bothering you?    Baby: Why do camels have humps?    Mother: Well son, we are desert animals, we need the humps to store  water and we are known to survive without water.   Baby: Okay, then why are our legs long and our feet rounded?    Mother: Son, obviously they are meant for walking in the desert. You  know with these legs I can move around the desert better than anyone does! Said > the mother proudly.   Baby: Okay, then why are our eyelashes long? Sometimes it bothers my sight.   Mother: My son, those long thick eyelashes are your protective cover. They help to protect your eyes from the desert sand and wind. Said mother camel with eyes rimming with pride....   Baby: I see. So the hump is to store water when we are in the desert,  the legs are for walking through the desert and these eye lashes protects my  eyes from the desert......  Then what the hell are we doing here in the Zzzoooooo !!!!!!???

       Punctuality and Dress Code.   Wala talaga tayong takas sa reklamo ng mga matatanda ng simbahan, kaya heto ang ipinatupad na mga polisiya para bantayan ang serbisyo natin sa pamamagitan ng angkop na pananamit at ugali sa simbahan:  Una,  bawal  ang spaghetti straps, hanging shirt, plunging necklines at  sleeveless  shirts tuwing kakanta sa misa (sa lahat ng okasyon) para sa mga babae. Minumungkahi na magsuot ng cardigan o jacket kung di maiwasan na mag-sleeveless (at tanggalin na lang ang cardigan kapag nagpa-praktis na tayo). Sa mga lalaki, bawal ang shorts na kahit anong haba (iba pa rin ang hitsura ng pantalon na bitin sa puruntong). Sa kabutihang palad, hindi pa bawal ang tsinelas o sandalyas. Kung praktis, okei lang na mag-shorts at mag-tsinelas :)   Pangalawa, inaasahan na 5-10 minuto bago magsimula ng misa ay  dumarating  na tayo. Ang "cut-off time ng mahuhuli ay hanggang  Aleluya  lamang. Pagkatapos nito, hindi na pwede umupo sa "risers" at sa likod na lamang ng mga tao o "congregation" mamalagi.  Sa pagkakataon na 3 beses tayo hindi makakanta sa pagitan ng dalawang buwan, SUSPINDIDO tayo at di pakakantahin ng isang buwan... .   Pakiusap, huwag na sana natin paabutin sa ganitong kahihiyan ang ating grupo. Kooperasyon at malasakit ang kailangan. Suporta din siguro, dahil pare-prehong tao ang madalas nakikita sa ating mga misa. Kung nagkataong nagkasakit at nagkalakad ang lahat ng tao, walang maiiwan para sumalo.   Sana, katulad ng narinig ko nung General Meeting, ay mag-"improve" ang partisipasyon ng bawat isa. Salamat at kita-kits tayo!

       sportsfest aftermath.   musta na mga pipol? I bet masasakit din ang mga katawan ninyo tulad ko dahil sa isang buong araw na puno ng aksyon. CONGRATULATIONS to all!   1st place - Blue (Jobbers) Team 2nd  place - White Pirates 3rd place - Red Brats    bawat team ay may kanya-kanyang galing, meron din kanya-kanyang kahinaan. Noteworthy (MVPs) are: Ambo (Bo!Bo!Bo!) for basketball. Pwede na ata siyang pang PBL. Papa Jerz for patintero. Hindi mo aakalaing mabilis siya sa laki nyang yan ha?!! Kuya Rey for volleyball. Wa na ko ma-say, expected na. Chiclet n Miko for badminton singles. Just means na wala sa laki o liit ng tao ang sport na ito. Kahit halos himatayin na sila, hindi pa rin sila matalo-talo. Willan for sipa. Halatang batang kalye ?tong mamang ito. Mitch/Jay for choreo ng cheering. Pang grade school yung cheers, pero magaling ang steps n presentation. Jupz for basketball shootout. Biruin mo yun! Ang kalmado niya, kahit pa nanonood si papa chu. Onang for the egg roll. Si Tso? RL talaga comedy. Si Mama Cielo sa sobrang saya nalaglag ang pustiso, hee,hee.  Sige, isusunod ang pictures natin. Abangan!

Rejoice in the grace of salvation in Christ’s resurrection! ***** nakaktuwa naman ang attendance ng ating koro sa Holy Triduum masses (Thursday to Sunday). Active na active ang lahat, wearing the group colors (red, white and blue). Nag-uumapaw ang bleachers na sa ating choir pa lang kulang na (at least, hindi na tayo e-epalan ng ibang grupo).   Kamusta ang mga hinulaan ko? Nagmistulang madame maan ako ng holy week. nakalimutan ko na ang mga kombinasyon ng mga baraha ninyo, pero sana’y tandaan ninyo ang mga sinabi ko. Huwag niyo rin masyadong dibdibin…pinaka-hindi kapani-paniwala yung kay Cherry (may sexual problem daw yung boyfriend niya!)…  Sa mga hindi nakasama sa Bisita Iglesia ngayong taon, alam niyo ba na nilakad namin hanggang New York, Cubao? Nag-start kami sa Gesu, sta. Clara, Miraculous Medal (Proj. 4), St. Joseph, Murphy, 13th ave. church at New York. Galing, kala ko di ko kakayanin. Madami nga lang stop-overs, tsaka di na ko sumama sa daan ng krus ng 12 midnight. Madami naman pumunta eh…

      "DIVE" Music by: Toto Sorioso Lyrics by: me :)  Feel the soft breeze Caress your face Close your eyes and listen to me Call you closer, strain and hear my call Lift your feet and urge them  To jump higher Fly and spread your wings and prepare to  Dive and enter my world Share the flickering sunlight And murky depths below Feel the warm and cold Trap your soul to me, forever Dive and enter my world  Hmmm  Anyone can see right through me How can you be afraid What you see is what you get Take a deep breath and take a  Dive and enter my world  Share the gentle ebb and flow Or toss and bounce against the raging  Waves and sink into my arms forever Dive and enter my world.  Go to where your heart leads you And uncover the treasure you might see Donâ€™t fight the current that pulls you deeper Make the leap and take a   Dive to enter my world  Share the flickering sunlight And murky depth below Feel the warm and cold  Trap your soul to me    Dive and enter my world  Share the gentle ebb and flow Or toss and bounce against the raging waves  and sink into my arms forever Dive and enter my world   GUESSING GAME Music by: Toto Sorioso Lyrics by: me!  I sit and stare Wrinkle my brows in confusion Elusive glances are all you can give  Tell me whatâ€™s on your mind Tell me what I can find Can you/Please find the words to say what  Iâ€™ve been waiting to hear all day  Downcast eyes Deep, down and troubled Lengthy silences  Travel in space Iâ€™ve been trying always for you to  Tell me what's on your mind Tell me what I can find Please find the words to say what I've been waiting to hear all day  Let go and let it be For sweet surrender our painful agony Relief from constriction is cathartic So pleaseâ€¦  Tell me what's on your mind Tell me what I can find Can you find the words to say what I've been waiting to hear all day (2x)  Let down your guard Let me break them down Cut the chase to face me and...  Tell me what's on your mind Tell me what I can find PLease find the words to say what  I've been waiting to hear all day (2x)  Tell me...

       tahimik na pagtanaw sa malawak na kawalan hithit sa patpat at  hinanapan ng kahulugan ang payapang binibigay ng  puting binubuga    sa pagkakatayo at  tahimik na kinalalagyan kuliglig nagwawala  pagkatapos ng ulan hanging malamig na humahampas sa mukha     inuubos ang upos sinasagad hanggang dulo hilo sa usok na  nanunuot sa dugo inapakan na ang bisyo at ang sandaling katahimikan    28 july 04

       Parang kulang ang salita  para mailarawan ang tamis ng pagsuyo  ng isang nagmamahal sa kanyang minamahal     Parang kulang ang salita&nbsp;para mabigkas  ang kalaliman ng pag-ibig na  nanatiling misteryo  &nbsp; Parang kulang ang salita  para sa nag-uumapaw na kaligayahan  sa tuwi-tuwina   Parang kulang din ang salita sa  maligalig na pakikipagbuno sa  hindi inaasahan   Parang kulang din ang salita sa  lalim ng pait na madarama sa isang  pagkawala   Parang kulang din ang salita sa  paalam na walang hanggang  dusa at lungkot   Kulang ang salita sa kahit anoâ€™ng nasabi na  pero hindi pa rin nasasabiâ€¦

      You who have breathed life to my soul You who have blessed my spirit with wonder You who have gifted me with creative fervor You who have clothed my being with love  You who have heard my anguished cries You who have received all of my hate You who have seen my hopelessness You who gave silence to my gravest prayers  Have not led me to a clear path Have not shared my lifeâ€™s purpose Have sunk me to rock bottom Have left me swinging at the edge of a cliff  aimlessly wandering a rocky journey hopeless for a happy future puzzled on a senseless existence all questions remain unanswered   13 july 2004

      Paano na kung lilisanin mo na ako Na walang pangakong magbabalik pa?  Paano na kung maghahanap ako ng kausap Sa gitna ng gabi at hindi mo na ako papakinggan?  Paano na kung nanlalamig ang mga kamay ko At wala akong ibang makakapitan?  Paano na kung sa tindi ng lungkot Hindi ko mahanap ang iyong mga ngiti?  Paano na kung akoâ€™y natatakot at  Hindi ko maramdaman ang yakap mong mahigpit?  Paano na kung akoâ€™y nangungulila at hindi ko  Madama ang init ng iyong halik?  Paano na nga ba? Lagi na lang akong nag-iisa..  10 july 04

      Gusts of wind that slap the face  Hair gets caught in the mouth  Salt that flows over the eyes   A quiver trembles the lips  A sigh that escapes the breath  It seeps under the skin   Cold that touches goosebumps  Space devoid of joy  Brow over a frown   Hollow is the gaze  Limp in the limbs  Farewell to a smile...   ...for a time.  04 jan 04

      Stares of awestruck eyes Unbelieving, dazed Of the presence of a beloved Mind reeling in attempting to freeze the sweetness of a smile  Pulses race Nervous laughter erupts Hands meet and tightly squeeze for assurance Skin tingles, body shivers from the undeniable chemistry  A kiss and a sigh Of wanting more Crushing hugs and gentle whispers envelop the lonely soul Traces of tears behind the mask...  Gripping the edge Clawing at empty air Resisting hasty exits Of sad goodbyes Time slips away...  01 july 04

       Dahil sa kakitiran ng utak Dahil sa bugso ng damdamin May mga salitang akong nasambit At nakasakit    Sa isang iglap, nagbago lahat Parang itinali sa kadena kaya Lumubog ang damdamin At tanong ay bakit    Kahit gustong bawiin Luhaâ€™y di mapigil Hindi magawang huminahon At saka pumikit    Sana maalis na itong kirot At mapatawad ng husto Sa di pagkaka-unawaan Dahil sa isang hirit

       I was overly protective of HER, HER whose same blood runs through my veins. We had waded through swamps, travelled in tinted cars and hid in houses that wonâ€™t seem to lock itâ€™s doors and windows. It was always an urgent flight. Hiding behind pillars and running, always running. I am enveloped by fear but at the same time resigned that I would fight the assassin threatening to kill family, and whom I wonâ€™t give up till my body is lifeless and cold. I prepare myself mentally, knowing that Iâ€™m scared, but that I have courage that will be enough to wield itâ€™s power to defeat helplessness, and only this mattersâ€¦      (from last night's dream) 03 aug 04

       There were choir boys or priests, Iâ€™m not sure, all sitting in a semi-circle on an altar, all in white robes. Robes that looked like Dominican friarâ€™s robes to be exact. The altar was a haze of gold, and the ornate carvings were a blur. I was afraid to approach them, but I had to, in pursuit of something. On itâ€™s left was a wooden door that I had to go to, and instead of opening it, I stepped right through it and melted into it like a ghost. There stood a woman in a medieval gown, of ivory I think, who had metal brandishings on the neckline and the waist. She gave me the SOMETHING I needed. I grabbed it, and was on my way out when she warned me that the door would lead me to another dimension, and that the exit would always keep on changing whenever I went "out". I took the "exit" on my first tryâ€¦I donâ€™t remember the place at all. The second try I was dangling from a vine of a tree, and thousands of feet below were the light green tops of a lush tropical forest on a bright morning that stretched as far as I could see. From then on I donâ€™t remember if I got back to where I originally came fromâ€¦      (from my Monday night dream) 03 Aug 04
