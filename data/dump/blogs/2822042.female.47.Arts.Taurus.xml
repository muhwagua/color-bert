      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings ©  Hank Thompson sat in his office when Gore warrior came to pay him a visit since Hank was not really a warlock he never was able to vanquish him. "Hi can I help you? "Hank asked the huge man.  "I think it's the other way around, I think I can help you because you have been wronged by a woman you once knew as Cheyenne." He said sitting down in the chair in front of the desk with a smile wearing all black.  "I am sorry I don't recall any woman by the name of Cheyenne." He told Gore warrior.  "Let me refresh your memory for you." he told him as his eyes glowed restoring the memory of his life with Cheyenne.  With a look of utter disbelief. "Mystics Shadow." He said slowly looking at the man as he knew as Gore warrior. "You, I vanquished you." He said standing up from the desk.  "They allowed you to become one of them, and then her and her lover decided it was time for you to go that they no longer needed to use you. they kicked you out reversing any magic you had, any memory of being the High Priest so her and her lover Knight Shadow could marry making him the High Priest. He steals your wife, kid and riches. All I ever did was to pleasure her; she was a freak like the time while you were sleeping she told me to perform oral sex on her. She liked how I got her hot. She convinced you that I took your body so I could impregnate her. I impregnated her with her knowing it was me. She rode me hard that night calling out my name not yours." He told him seeing the rage in his face.  "That bitch!" Hank yelled looking at Gore warrior. "Why are you telling me this? Why should I believe you? What do you want out of it?" he asked him looking suspiciously at him.  "Because she dumped me too and you want them all dead like I do, don't you? She made you think you were the father of her daughter when she was sleeping with Knight Shadow the whole time! Mystic caster is his daughter." he told him knowing he had him now.  "Join us and we will give you powers they could never give you. Between the two of us we can kill your whore wife and her husband who replaced you in every aspect." He told him watching him as Hank believed him, he always thought the worse of Mystic Shadow when he was angry causing him to hurt her.  "But she died how could she have come back? He asked him remembering her death.  "That was a ploy to get rid of you, because Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow are very much alive." He told him seeing the anger in Hank's face.  "You have a deal I will join your forces!" Hank told him wanting revenge so bad he could taste it.  Gore warrior stood up hitting him with a lightening bolt in his heart killing him. His head lay back against the chair lifeless; his eyes opened slowly with a bright red glow as he grinned. "I know how to get the bitch to come to us. We will go to my house and use my bitch that I ended up with, with both of us involved attacking poor weak flat as a board Kathy it will bring my real whore of a wife out. I think its time for her lover and husband have one last fuck before we kill her!" he told Gore warrior as they both laughed. They appeared in the living room of his house while his wife was in the kitchen.  "I am home honey come meet my friend." He yelled for her smiling.  His wife came out looking at the huge man with Hank, she walked up to him to shake his hand when he grabbed her wrist pulling her up to his body as his eyes began to glow. Feeling fear she looked at Hank his eyes were glowing to just like the man holding her. "Let me go! Hank please stop him!" she pleaded as Gore warrior ripped off her clothing throwing her on the ground raping her savagely.  When he was done with her Hank grabbed her by the back of her hair throwing her on the ground sodomizing her.  Mystic Shadow got the vision of Gore warrior and Hank going to his house to kill his wife. "Hank has joined the dark side! He is with Gore warrior their going to kill his wife!" she told Knight Shadow then vanished.  Mystic Shadow appeared in the living room as Hank was raping his wife. Seeing his glowing eyes." You son of a bitch!" she yelled at him to get his attention to her and off of his wife.  "Mystic Shadow how nice that you wanted to join us." Gore warrior said grabbing her from behind, putting his hands on her breast as he licked her neck slowly.  "Fuck you!" she said throwing him over her back on to the ground.  "You bitch! You took everything from me!" Hank said rising up off his wife running at Mystic Shadow, his eyes were glowing as his wife watched them attacking the strange woman in white while she lay crying on the ground.  They both grabbed her before she could use her powers on them bringing her to the ground trying to rip her clothes off to rape her. Both Gore warrior and Hank went flying up against the wall from a powerful force. Knight Shadow and Rain caster stood there looking at the creatures from hell with hate and contempt.  "You know something Hank I never did like you, and I don't like you putting your vile hands on my wife!" he told him raising him up in the air as Hank tried to struggle free from Knight Shadow's powers.  Rain caster held Gore warrior frozen in one spot. "I think its feeding time Knight Shadow." He said smiling at the ghoulish demon.  Hank was crazed from the demonic forces flowing through his blood. "She was my wife that you fucked! You got her knocked up with Mystic caster! You two planned on getting me out of the way the whole time! You two were always taking off together, you even sent me the vision of the night you fucked her! I am her husband not you!" he yelled as he could not move as Knight Shadow was a powerful warrior.  "For one thing Hank, I don't fuck my wife, I make love to my wife and we conceived Mystic caster out of love something you know nothing about! You hid behind her making her do all the fighting while you whimpered like a fucking puppy! Reality is Hank you were never married to her; we were wed when she was twenty one years old." Knight Shadow told him slamming him against another wall as Mystic Shadow tried to comfort Hank's wife Kathy.  "That's for calling her a witch whore!" he told him slamming him up against the ceiling." This is for all the times you threw that slime of hell hanging in the air over there up in her face constantly!" he said throwing him on the ground at his feet stepping on his throat. " And this one, last but not least is for all the tears you ever made her shed from the cruelty you ever did to her. So for wishing that we were burnt at the stakes I grant your wish to be delivered to you!" he told him looking at him with a smile of satisfaction on his face.  "I Knight shadow, the true High Priest order this slime to pass hell to the one who eats the evil souls on this demons soul he may dine in to the place where he dwells!" he said stepping back as Hank blew up into flames.  "Tennis anyone?" Rain caster asked as he slammed Gore warrior into the wall.  "I think you mean hand ball." Knight Shadow told him as he too slammed Gore warrior into the wall leaving the outline of his body on the wall from the force they used. Knight Shadow and Rain caster began to chant together." "I Knight shadow, the true High Priest and Rain caster brother to the High Priest order this foul slime to by pass hell going to the one who eat the evil souls, we give him this demons soul so he may dine in to the place where he dwells!" they said stepping back as Gore warrior blew up into flames his demonic cries were loud as he burned.  Mystic Shadow looked at Kathy, she was frightened and finding it hard to believe her husband of twenty five years was a demon. "She can't stay here; the others will come for her." She told Knight Shadow holding Kathy's hand.  "One more place at the dinner table." He said smiling at Kathy all of them vanishing.  They explained to the woman that she would be staying with them where they could protect her from the dark side torturing her for Gore warrior's finale demise. He was one of their highest demons. Kathy was a great help to Mystic caster with the twins, she soon became accustom to the life style of the witches and warlocks. One warrior name Shadow caster who was a powerful warrior, with blond curly hair to his neck line, crystal blue eyes, he was very muscular standing six feet three inches weighing two hundred and thirty pounds, began spending a lot of time helping Kathy with the kids even teaching her how to dodge flying objects since the twins found it funny to slam Mr. bear against your head. Kathy would smile watching the love exchanged between Mystic Shadow and Knight shadow as they would roll around on the living room floor wrestling then kissing each other as new lovers do. Shadow caster went to Rain caster for advice on romancing this beautiful woman.  Rain Caster smiling." My advice is to take her some where secluded like on a tropical island, both of your attire should be tropical for a picnic lunch and let nature take its course." He told him patting him on the shoulder.  Shadow Caster took Rain Caster's advice approaching Kathy, he was nervous. "Kathy I was wondering if you'd go to lunch with me today?" he asked standing in front of her rubbing his hands together.  Kathy smiled at him feeling the same attraction for him." Yes I would love to go with you for lunch." She told him standing up from the chair wearing a white sleeveless dress.  Taking her hand they appeared on an island in the tropics, through his magic he changed their attire to tropical bathing suits, a blanket, and a basket full of food with a bottle of white wine. They sat on the blanket eating and laughing, the wine was making Kathy tipsy.  "I have wanted to do something since the first day I saw you." She told him getting on her knees in front of him where he was sitting.  "What have you wanted to do?" he asked smiling at her.  Kathy leaned over kissing him feeling his arms wrap around her, they fell back wards, their kisses becoming more passionate and intense un aware that it had started raining as he rolled on top of her letting his hands explore her body as well as his tongue, they made passionate love only noticing the storm when they exploded into a climax when a lightening bolt struck near where they were laying.  Looking at each other laughing for they both were startled. "I guess we should return to the house." He told her lying on top of her kissing her nose.  From that moment on he slept every night in her room holding her close to his body as they slept UN aware the fairies were giggling sprinkling them with their magical dust for protection as they did to everyone in the entire house. Fairies were always near the children day or night. Knight Shadow felt it was time to move to a new location considering they had been their six months now. Rain caster and Enchantress caster were sent to find a secluded place for them to move to with in the next twenty four hours. The husband and wife team soared through the skies invisible to anything. They found twenty acres of land in Northern Florida in a small town known as Live Oak, Rain Caster and Enchantress caster purchased the property, they then arranged for the lights and water to be installed paying extra for priority status as in yesterday. They purchased a two story log home to be delivered that day since he had already cleared the property using his magic. By the next evening everything was set up since Enchantress Caster living up to her name convinced the water and electrical companies to just place everything there that they would do the rest even showing them her degrees in electrical, plumbing and her builders contractors license. She was able to have the furniture delivered the next morning; it was all red wood and rustic looking furniture. They could not just pop everything into place since they were in a small town where everyone knew everyone else's business. They set up the fences that night when no one was around to see them using their magical powers.  Everyone was moved into the new home that night as they cast their spells for invisibilities and the shields that would kill evil beings in a fifty mile radius of the children. Ninja explored his new territory of twenty acres. Mystic Shadow stood smiling outside as the tiny little Fairies known to mortals as lightening bugs or fire flies would land in her hand excited to meet the High Priestess Mystic Shadow.  "No one must know we are here." She told them.  They promised to keep their secret and stayed around the cabin sprinkling their magical dust all over the grounds to ward off evil creatures from trying to venture on to the property. One female fairy took a liking to Ninja landing on his nose as he looked at her cross eyed, he would run chasing her for hours.  In the town of Jasper lived a Fox Fairy who was actually an undead spirit stealing love from humans in order to go on living by changing into a human form. This one particular Fox Fairy changed in a young nurse named Sherri. She was beautiful with long black hair, velvet blue eyes, pale skin, having natural red lips. Her body was voluptuous that men found her hard to resist. She preyed on the older men in their sixties that she met while they were hospitalized.  James Kluger was hospitalized for a mild stroke, he was average built, gray hair and mustache, his eyes were brown. She made sure she handled his case for she needed life added to her.  "and how is the most handsome man in the hospital doing today?" she asked smiling at him in her tight nurses dress that she made sure her cleavage was showing as she entered his room .  "Great since you came in here." He told her smiling; she made him feel good something he hadn't felt since his wife had died three years ago in an automobile accident.  "I have to give you a bed bath." She told him bending over him to untie the hospital gown as her breast brushed his cheek.  "I am lucky today." He told her smiling looking at her breast so close he could touch them with his mouth if he had the courage to do it.  She shut the door so she could bathe him without anyone seeing her. She washed his face, chest and back, when she got to his male organ she spent more time washing that area causing him to become erect.  "Well nothing wrong with it." She told him as she slowly washed it making him wanting to explode then stopping.  "I would give anything to have you climb in bed right now with me." He told her wanting to have a climax since she got him so worked up.  "Well you could hire me for private duty at your house you know; there no one would be able to disturb us." She said placing her hand on his hard organ.  "Well that's what I want." He told her as she stroked him until he climaxed.  "I will go arrange it for you." She told him giving him a kiss on his lips.  She had it arranged for him to be taken home that day where she would be with him twenty four hours a day. As soon as the paramedics left she was feeling weak, she walked into the bedroom where he waited for this creature of beauty watching her drop her uniform and under clothing on the floor. She joined him in the bed kissing him and stroking him, she licked his mouth going all the way down his body as his wife did not believe in oral sex he was enjoying the pleasures she was giving to him, she straddled him as he caressed her breast, grabbing her perfectly rounded hips as he exploded inside of her and this was how she stole the victims love through the orgasm they received from having sex with her. She stole his love where she was rejuvenated with life and he began to feel worthless.  Each time she had sex with him on a daily bases he felt more worthless and began to waste away until there was nothing left of him at the end of the third week  Cause of death was noted as natural causes from the stroke, but the official record was the Fox Fairy who would move on to another victim to steal love from. She thought she should try men in a bar it might start to look suspicious if too many of her patients died. She went to a bar in the town of Lake City wearing tight fitting blue jeans, a long sleeve blue western shirt with white fringe across her breast line, brown western boots with a white western hat. She sat next to a large Mexican man in his fifty's who was looking her over.  "You want a drink?" he said smiling at her.  "Thank you yes a screw driver." she told him placing her hand on his leg giving him a light kiss on his cheek.  As they drank their drinks making small talk he asked her to dance, they slow danced seductively, and he rubbed her back then holding her by the ass as they danced. He bragged to his friends how he was going to take her home giving her the best sex she ever had. And his bragging became truth as she let him take her home with him. Once at his mobile home he laid in the bed watching her take her clothes off slowly, he became aroused watching her as he got into bed with him he immediately began fondling her body, kissing her then getting on top of her where he was rough in sex which made him climax faster giving her what she needed life and he began to feel worthless. With in one month he felt so worthless wasting away to nothing he died from natural causes in his sleep.  The fairies told Mystics Shadow of the evil Fox Fairy that night Knight Shadow met her at the bar. Where she had no idea she was trying to entice the High Priest. He smiled at her after an hour with her coming on to him.  "Let's cut to the chase ok. I want to fuck you and you want to fuck me so why don't you follow me to my place and let me fuck your brains out?" he asked rubbing her thigh.  Sherri followed him home, once she got with in the fifty mile radius of the house a huge lightening bolt hit the car blowing her up along with the car. The police ruled it as a freak act of nature when the car behind them reported what happened they could never find any body parts any where. The official cause, Power of the white light.  Kathy started to become very tired and not feeling well Guardian caster sent for their doctor to check her even though she was a mortal she could still administer to her. When the doctor did her examination on her she did not have good news pulling Guardian Caster to the side to talk privately to her.  "She has terminal cancer she will be lucky if she makes it another month." She told her looking at the poor girl who would soon die.  "I will have Mystic Shadow tell her." She told the doctor. "Stay here until we get back here.  Shadow Caster was with Mystic Shadow when she broke the news of Kathy's condition. His eyes tearing up as he heard the woman he loved would only be alive for one more month.  "It is not fair! Why does she have to leave me? She makes my life worth living." He cried into his hands.  "I will go tell her." Mystic Shadow told him touching his shoulder as he grabbed her hand.  "Marry us before she dies, tonight if possible?" he asked her looking so lost.  "Sure I will, but let us talk to her first." She said looking sad as she knew the pain he must be feeling.  They walked into the room where Kathy was sitting with the doctor looking scared knowing she must have found something serious. Mystics Shadow walked up to her sitting beside her on the bed.  "Kathy the doctor found cancer in you." She told her seeing the fear in her eyes.  "How bad is it?" she asked looking at Shadow Casters face knowing he was holding back tears." I am going to die aren't I?" she asked knowing the answer in her heart as tears ran down her face.  "Yes Kathy, you have about a month to live." She told her as tears came to her eyes.  Shadow Caster taking her in his arms." I don't want to lose you now that I have found you!" he cried holding her tightly." You're my true love. I want to marry you tonight Kathy." He told her looking into her eyes.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © She smiled through her tears looking at him." I love you, I will love you even after I am gone, don't morn my death when it comes because you and everyone here have become my family, I love you all. And yes I will marry you tonight." She told him crying so hard in his arms.  "We will have the ceremony at mid night." Mystic Shadow told them as she left the room quickly going to the room with potions and the spell book.  "You can not cure her by magic or potions or you will change the universe." Guardian Caster told her.  "If we cure a mortal we change the universe, but if we save them from evil we get patted on our backs." She said sitting over the spell book.  "It's her destiny, look what happened when evil changed your destiny." She told her.  "Fine! I will do nothing." She told her walking out of the room.  At midnight the eight witches made the cabin beautiful with sparkling flowers, fairies flying all around, they dressed Kathy in a long white wedding gown resembling a gown a princess would wear.  Her prince wore a white tuxedo as they stood in front of Knight Shadow and Mystic Shadow.  "I Mystic Shadow have gathered our family here tonight to witness the holy union of Kathy and Shadow Caster who want to vow their love as ever lasting love, to honor each other, to treat each other with kindness, Shadow Caster vows to protect his bride Kathy. Never leaving each other unless death causes the separation." She said as tears rolled down her Face.  "I Knight Shadow ask the Higher Power for the blessing of this union, to protect them from out side forces from destroying what you Our Lord have tied together never to be broken." He said knowing that death was nearing.  "We the High Priest and High Priestess pronounce you husband and wife." They said in unison as Mystic Shadow broke down into tears.  "It's alright Mystic Shadow, I am lucky that you all have been here with me and will be with me in my final hour." She told her crying as were the other witches.  The hardest thing was to watch Kathy grow weaker every day and the pain was sometimes so unbearable. Shadow Caster would carry her everyday to play with the children she had come to love. He would then carry her out to watch the fairies playing with Ninja at night, she would smile as tears formed in her eyes knowing she got to know true goodness through these witches and warlocks and these were the memories she wanted to take with her to her grave.  Kathy woke up in the morning her breathing was becoming raspy. "baby the time is here for me to leave you." She told him crying.  "Please gather the others it won't be much longer." She told him feeling death approaching her.  Shadow caster cried for everyone to hurry as he stood at the door hurrying back to her taking her in his arms. Everyone gathered around her death bed. She looked at everyone with tears. "I love you all, you have made me happy. I have just one request could I kiss the children good bye?" she asked crying for saying good bye to them would be the hardest part of accepting death.  They handed her Flame Caster." I will always be watching you from heavens windows." She told him as he touched her face as if he knew she was dying. They handed Mystical Lightening to her. "I will miss you little Princess" she was telling her as the angel of death entered the room Mystic Shadow held up her hand for just a few more minutes." I will always love you and I will be watching you grow from heavens windows." She told her as Mystical Lightening began to cry hanging on to her tightly, the child's tears fell on to her face, Kathy began to glow brightly and the angel of death departed with out Kathy.  Guardian Caster smiled. "She has the power to heal through her tears." She told them as Kathy was a radiant glow then Mystical Lightening let go and Kathy was cured of the cancer.  Shadow Caster grabbed his wife." You're going to live! Oh thank you Lord for instilling the powers to heal in Mystical Lightening." He said looking up at the heavens through the window holding Kathy in his arms as they cried witnessing the miracle.  Mystic caster held her daughter kissing her as tears fell softly down her face." You are truly a blessed gift from the Higher Power." She told her smiling and kissing her cheek.  Mystical Lightening looked down at Kathy smiling as if she knew she had just performed a healing miracle.  Ben Johnson a forty year old widowed black male, standing five feet six inches, he was stocky with a muscular build, he moved from New Jersey and relocated to Perry Florida, he is an active member of a Satanic cult, he met the widow Amy Meyers two months ago. She is a thirty five year old white female, long blond hair, brown eyes, she was five feet two inches, full figured with a eighteen year old virgin daughter Lisa who looked identical to her mother. Amy Meyers having a hard time financially believed Ben was sent by God to her for he showed up one day at her door with two bags of groceries Amy was unaware he had been watching them for a month finding out her situation. He asked Amy out that night to dinner, Amy couldn't see the harm since he did just buy them food never noticing that he was eyeing her young daughter's body thinking that she was at the right age to be a breeder to him so they could sacrifice the babies since it was believed the younger the animal or child offered to Satan the greater it made the sacrifice . Smiling as he fantasized of assaulting her young body. He would pick her up at seven that evening. Lisa did not like the man, begging her mother not to go out with him.  "Please mom don't go he gives me the creeps." She begged her mother.  "You just don't like him because he is black Lisa! I am old enough to decide who I will date and there hasn't been anyone knocking to take me out." She told her daughter as she put her make up on.  Amy decided on a light blue blouse leaving the button open to expose some of her cleavage as she and her daughter were quite endowed, she wore a dark blue skirt that fit tight showing her wide hips.  "Damn I have put on more weight." She said out loud to her self as she put on a pair of black heels.  When Ben arrived he was dressed in a light yellow long sleeve dress shirt, black slacks with black shoes. He waited in the living room watching Lisa who was in a pair of cut off jeans just below her buttocks and a striped tank top. He watched her as she bent over to pick something up as her shorts would expose her buttocks cheeks, causing him to become aroused. I will enjoy breeding with you. He thought to himself with a smile when Amy entered the room.  "Well I am finally ready." She said smiling. "I'll be back later sugar, there is food in there you can eat thanks to Ben." She told her daughter smiling at Ben.  They ate at a small diner in town making small talk as he was slowly enticing her to return with him to his place. "Have you seen the documentary they have out about the Occult?" he asked her looking into her eyes.  "I don't believe in that stuff." She told him eating a bite of steak.  "I have it at my place if you would like to view it with me that is." he said smiling at her breast making sure she knew he had other intentions  She saw him looking at her breast. Well I haven't had sex with a man for six months and looks like he is interested, guess I will find out if it is true about black men. She thought to herself smiling. "I would love to watch it with you." She told him smiling visualizing them in bed instead of watching some boring documentary on the occult.  Once they got to the small efficiency he was renting he put the tape in to his VCR. "We will have to sit on the bed." He told her smiling as he watched her climbing on to the bed remembering Lisa bending down.  As they sat up next to each other watching the satanic ritual taking place he leaned over kissing her thinking of Lisa he was kissing, he unbuttoned her shirt keeping his eyes closed placing his hand on her breast feeling the nipple hardened, he licked her chest as he removed her top and bra fondling her breast. He was so aroused from his fantasy of Lisa he took her skirt and panty hose off; he removed his clothes then began oral sex on her. she never heard him whispering Lisa's name for she was enjoying the pleasure his was giving her, only he was using her to act out what he was going to do to Lisa. Once he got to the point where she was going to climax he raised his body over hers as he entered her with his eyes closed visualizing Lisa's face letting out a soft moan as he began to thrust his hips harder and deeper as they exploded into a climax. Amy was unaware while they were having intercourse his brain washing method was sinking into her subconscious mind. After they had sex he took her home promising to come over tomorrow where they all could go on a picnic. He pulled his car down the road a little then walked back to Amy's mobile home where he stood at Lisa's bedroom window watching her undress getting an erection as she looked at her naked body in the mirror touching her well developed breast thinking she was exploring her body in the privacy of her bedroom, but Ben was watching her and masturbating until he climaxed.  "Soon I will be planting my seed in you so that I may sacrifice the virgin child to Satan." He said to her smiling standing outside her window.  It didn't take Ben more then three days to convince Amy to let him move in with her and Lisa. Amy being so financial strapped and man hungry jumped at the chance of having a man in her life again to help her pay the bills. A month had gone by since he moved in slipping Amy drugs to help him brain wash her faster to giving into his Satanic belief. As they laid in bed he began to explain to her how he needed Lisa to be a breeder for him, meaning he would have to plant his seed in her and the rewards they would be given would keep them from ever having to struggle again. She looked at him thinking to her self, never having to worry about money again.  "would this please you by me helping you to sleep with Lisa?" she asked him not wanting to displease him causing him to leave since he has paid all the bills and she even quit work.  "Yes because we would be doing it together my love." He told her smiling and kissing her.  "Alright then let's do it." She told him.  "Ok now you will have to hold her down while I tape her mouth to muffle the screams, then I will do what I must in order to keep our financial situation from dying. If we do not keep him happy he will take it all away. It's a sacrifice I am willing to make by sleeping with your daughter for you are my true love." He told her his lies knowing she believed everything he told her.  They crept into Lisa's room as she lay sleeping soundly when Amy grabbed her arms over her head while Ben sat on top of Lisa taping her mouth so her screams could not be heard. She looked back at her mother, her face showing her fear as tears fell down her face shaking her head no, feeling her night gown being ripped off of her and his mouth on her between her thighs. she cried harder feeling so dirty when he raised himself over her body entering her with such force she screamed out from the pain with her eyes wide looking at her mother who held her hands back watching this man raping her for what seemed like hours until he released himself in side of her. They left her laying in the bed crying warning her that if she told anyone they would kill her and her grand mother who lived five miles down the road. Lisa lay in her bed bleeding from the rape, crying then ran from her room to the bathroom where she began vomiting violently not believing her own mother was involved with this as she listened to them laughing and then having sex which made her vomit again.  "I hate you both!" she cried knowing if she said anything they would kill her and Grandma." Oh daddy I wish you were here." She cried with her head over the toilet.  The next morning her mother left to go to the store when Ben entered her room naked with an erection violating her again as she cried feeling his mouth and body on hers. After the attack he brought her in a drink forcing her to drink it drugging her. She slept for hours waking up finding it was dark out side, looking at her clock it was eight o'clock at night when she saw the door open with him coming into the room. "Get up your sleeping in our room from now on." He told her pulling her still naked body out of the bed.  He took her to the shower where he took a shower with her washing her body enjoying touching her breast and between her thighs. Taking her out of the shower as she was almost like a zombie he dried her body.  "You're going to enjoy it tonight, I promise you." He said grabbing her face with his hands kissing her.  Inside of her mothers bedroom Amy was laying in bed reading a book, Ben gave Lisa the drink that was spiked with a stimulate. She began to feel her body tingling all over. He placed her in the bed next to her mother who gave Lisa a glancing smile then went back to reading her book as Ben took Lisa in his arms kissing her which made her body react with strange feelings, these feelings began to grow stronger as he caressed her breast then he raised her body on top of his moving her hips with his hands causing a strange desire with in her. She liked the way he was making her feel leaning down to kiss him he kissed her passionately as they exploded into an orgasm. Once her mother fell to sleep he took her to her bedroom where he abused her again telling her they were in love or she would not feel like she does with him.  "Do you want me to stop?" he asked her knowing the drug had full control over her body now.  "No. I do love you because you make my body feel so good." Lisa told him not knowing it was the drug he gave her making her feel this way.  After they had sex for half the night they returned to the bed with her mother who he had knocked out with a drug. Lisa fell to sleep in his arms to be woken the next morning by him having sex with her mother as he looked over at her mouthing I love you. Lisa became jealous of her mother for he was hers now not her mothers.  He sent Amy to the store once she was gone Lisa straddled his lap as he placed his hands under her shirt on her breast.  "Why did you have sex with her if you love me?" she asked him kissing his lips.  "She makes me or I can't have you anymore, like I want you now." He told her kissing her." do you want to make me happy?" he asked her kissing her breast.  "Yes I will do anything for you." She told him believing he was in love with her.  "Use your mouth on me to pleasure me." He told her unzipping his pants and having her to perform oral sex on him, when she tried to stop he forced her head down on him." Finish it if you love me." He told her until he reached his climax. "Now I know you really love me." He told her kissing her.  A month later Ben began visiting Amanda who had a reputation with the men in town, she was a single mother of two small boys next door. The mother was only twenty eight years old, petite build, with short brown hair. One day as they were standing in the kitchen he kissed her; he felt her hand on his penis through his pants. Going into the bedroom undressing she began to perform oral sex on him as he looked at the picture of her two small boys hanging on her bedroom wall visualizing sacrificing them to Satan he became even more aroused. She moved her body on top of him riding him slowly teasing him, out of frustration he threw her on her back on the bed entering her forcibly thrusting his hips as hard as he could realizing she liked it the rougher he got, he rose off of her throwing her on her stomach sodomizing her as he fantasized plunging a large silver knife in the heart of the youngest boy. He exploded into an insane sexual orgasm. He wanted more realizing she loved to have pain inflicted on her during sex, he threw her on her on her back tying her hands and feet to the bed as he rammed himself in her as hard as he could, sinking his teeth into her flesh causing her pleasure, wanting more pain as he gave it to her until they exploded together in a climax. Ben went home falling on the bed from sexual exhaustion.  The next morning when Amanda got up to feed her boys breakfast they were not in their beds, their window was open. She threw on her robe running through the trailer park calling out her son's names. Surrounding neighbors came out of their mobile homes including Amy, Ben and Lisa. No one had seen the boys since yesterday she ran back to her mobile home calling the police. The police searched all over until they found the boys. Amanda seeing the police cars pull up ran out of her mobile home thinking they had them in the car. By the officers look on his face she knew it was not good news.  With tears coming to her eyes." My boys where are they?" she asked holding her hands together.  "We're sorry we found the boys bodies in a dumpster. The oldest Timothy had been sexually molested then suffocated to death, while the youngest boy Mark had been killed with a stab wound in the heart." The detective told her.  Amanda had this look of terror come over her face as she fell to her knees in shock from the news, tears ran down her face "Nooooo! God no not my babies!" she cried as the detective picked her up off the ground and she began struggling to get away." No I want my children! Their not dead! You're lying to me! Who would want to hurt my babies?" she cried as she stopped struggling looking into his eyes as she cried.  "A very sick individual and when I catch him I might just kill him instead of wasting the tax payers money." He told her holding her as she cried.  The police could not find one finger print inside of the house or side of the house, not of the boys and hardly any of Amanda's as if the place had been wiped clean inside and out. Whoever did this had to come back and clean the place up while she lay sleeping in her bed, they even went in her room quietly. So the police knew it had to be someone she knew and who had been inside the house to know what room the boys were in. She gave them a list of names of people who had been inside including Bens. The detective went next door to question Ben who admitted to being there.  "Man she is a freak, I fucked her ok and she wanted it harder and rougher making me bite her until she got off. I was so exhausted I came home falling on the bed passing out." He told her as Amy and Lisa listened that he had sex with Amanda. Lisa turned around going to her room not wanting to hear anymore. She lay in her bed crying. After the detectives left she heard her mother and him fighting.  "What my daughter wasn't enough for your sexual appetite? I let you fuck her to conceive a child so we could sacrifice it to get more money and you go fuck that whore!" her mother told him just loud enough so Lisa could hear what they were saying.  Lisa became scared especially when she heard he sacrificed the boys or the money would have stopped. Without making a sound she slipped out of the window running as fast as she could to the woods that she knew like the back of her hand. She kept running and running looking back to make sure she was not being followed by them. She would stop every once in a while until she ran out of the woods where she saw a two story log cabin that was not there almost three months ago the last time she came out here. She watched the lightening bugs flying all around it, she began running to the house for Fear her mother and Ben would find her. Ninja sat on the porch watching the frighten child running up to the house as she stopped looking back for fear they were behind her, she bolted up the stairs banging on the door.  "Help me please!" she cried out, banging even harder when Mystic Shadow answered the door. "What is wrong?" she asked when she got a vision of Ben killing a baby. Realizing she hadn't vanished either.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © "Please let me in before they see me!" she told her crying looking back scared for her life.  "Come inside." Mystic Shadow told her. "Who is after you?" she asked.  "If I tell you they will kill not just me and Grandma, but you too." She told her full of fear.  "Trust me no one is going to hurt you, your Grandmother or us." She said as the others joined her.  "No he is evil, he turned my mother evil!" she cried into her hands.  "Ok I am going to tell you something we are warriors of the white light, we work for the Higher Power, we vanquish evil. Step to the door and watch this." She told her going outside as she made a clay bird appear in her hand.  The girl could not believe what she was seeing, Mystic Shadow made it fly into the air then blew it up with her magic turning to the young girl  " we will protect you." She told her looking serious.  "My mom let this guy move in with us, then they came into my room not long ago and he raped me while my mom held me down." She cried into her hands.  "Ok hush, let me place my hands on each side of your head I will read your memory since it is to painful for you to remember." She told the young girl.  Mystic Shadow saw everything as it played out like a movie screen before the room not believing what a mother could allow to happen to her child for some man. They all watched all the things that went on. Even the part of him sacrificing the little boys that Lisa heard them talking about before she left."  "Why didn't I get a vision?" she asked Knight Shadow.  The shield must be keeping out anything that has to do with evil including your visions." He told her feeling anger towards this man.  Mystic Shadow stood up, "Jada Caster, Destiny Shadow lets go pay Mr. wanna be demon a visit, and his wanna be bitch who is going to be shocked to see the real witch!" she said taking hold of Lisa's hand.  "No he'll kill me!" she cried.  Knight Shadow knelt down beside her. "You have nothing to fear watch the wall over there." He told her as he played for her where Mystic Shadow fought Lillie.  " see she will let no harm come to you." He told her.  "Wow where did you learn to do that?" she asked smiling  "We are good witches, not evil." She told her appearing inside the mobile homes living room where she could hear Ben yelling at Amy.  Mystic Shadow smiling and clearing her voice. "Um excuse me Mr. Satan worshipper, but I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light command you and your bitch to appear before me now!" she yelled as she heard them go silent then they were standing in front of her as she held Lisa's hand, Destiny Shadow and Jada Caster who were also in their warrior uniforms, Lisa looked at them even more impressed by these women.  Ben and Amy had fear in their eyes as they knew they were standing in front of real supernatural beings. Ben tried to run as Mystic Shadow slammed him into the wall. "I never said you could move did I?" she asked bringing him back to her.  Amy was too scared to move as Mystic Shadow looked at her with disgust." How could you hold your baby girl down and let this foul thing called a man rape her to have a baby to kill?" she asked raising her up in the air.  Amy was so scared she urinated all over herself.  " He made me or he'd kill me." She told her.  "Damn your going to really get it now for lying to her since we can read your minds." Jada Caster told her smiling.  "You lying bitch! You gave her to him to please him for fear of losing him!" Mystic Shadow yelled at her." Isn't that the truth!" she yelled slamming her down on the ground.  "Yes it's true." She told her crying looking up at Lisa with contempt.  Mystic Shadow jerked her up off the ground catching her by her throat." Don't you even look side ways at that little girl!" she told her as she squeezed harder on her throat.  The whole trailer park was standing in front of the mobile home including the detective and Amanda. The detective opened the door. "I am afraid I can not allow you to go on with this." He told them holding his gun on them.  Jada caster yelled." Gun's come to me!" she looked back at the detective "you have no choice in the matter." Turning back to the two idiots" I think we should show them to the people out there like they did in Salem." She told Mystic Shadow.  They brought the two people out in front of the crowd with the detective watching with Amanda. They watched these three women with Lisa. Mystic Shadow looked at the crowd as she raised the couple up in the air.  "I am Mystic Shadow High Priestess of the white Light that protects the innocents from evil like these two. Here is a mother who held her daughter down for this slime ball to rape." She told them as she made the memory from Lisa's mind appear for them to watch. And this jerk wanted to get Lisa pregnant so he could use the infant to sacrifice to Satan!" She allowed the people to see Amy and Ben making the deal. With tears in her eyes for she felt the boys fear, their pain and the loss of the mothers pain going through her body, this slime who lives for Satan killed four year old Mark after sodomizing and suffocating his nine year old brother Timothy, allowing the crowd only to see him injecting the boys and the mother to knock them out so he could take the boys out of the house so they would not wake up.  "I Mystic Shadow High Priestess of the white light have been granted by Our Higher Power to send these wicked evil creatures straight to hell where forever together they will dwell!" She said as the people blew up before the crowd as they watched their screaming souls being dragged into hell.  Mystic Shadow walked up to the grieving mother taking her in her arms as they both cried for Mystic Shadow wished she could have gotten a vision.  "Did my boys suffer any?" she asked her.  "No, they were drugged and did not know what was happening. Would you like to be able to say good bye to them?" she asked Amanda.  "Yes, you can do that?" She asked she asked smiling as tears filled her eyes like pools.  Mystic Shadow sent a message to her father who brought the little angels down to their mother. The mother's eyes tearing up as she looked at her boys wearing white suits, white shoes and little white wings that sparkled. The crowd and the detective had tears in their eyes.  "Hi mommy, don't cry over us any more we are in a safe place with nice angels who take care of us. We will see you when it's your time to come home, but its not now mommy." Timothy told his mother walking up to her hugging her for they were granted a few minutes so she could hug her boys.  "Mommy I play with fairies and a dog name Ralph." He said smiling running to hug her." Be good mommy so you can come to our home, it is so pretty." He told her going back to Fire caster taking his hand.  "I love you my babies." She told them as they were leaving. "Thank you Mystic Shadow." She said hugging her tightly.  Jada Caster turned to the detective." You might need these in your line of work." She told him smiling handing his guns back.  "Thank you I am just trying to figure out how to write this report." He told her.  Mystic Shadow smiled "they caused themselves to get blown up, it was such a massive explosion there were no body parts left to be found. All of your memories of us will be gone, the memories you have will be they blew up the home when the detective discovered who they were. I will allow your good byes to your sons to have been in a dream." Mystic Shadow told her turning to Lisa." I am dropping you off at your grandmother's house, but first I need to inject you with this shot to prevent the pregnancy to continue if it had started." She told her taking the needle the doctor sent to her." Ready to go?" she asked smiling knowing that Lisa had a bright future ahead of her filled with college and a very handsome husband who will be a doctor.  "Yes I am ready." She said smiling at her heroines. Then they vanished taking her to her grand mothers explaining what her daughter in law did to Lisa. That would be the only memory they would have. Lisa staying with her sixty five year old Grandmother filled a void and the loneliness of living alone in her large wooden house.  Three years had past since they moved to the two story log cabin, the twins powers were growing as fast as they were. They were only allowed to fly inside of the house. When they were out side though they had gotten better with their aim since Mystic caster and Lightening caster decided it was time for them to experience farm life, they were able to throw a cow patty using their powers over to the five acres hitting their father with it square in the back where he had set up a garden so the children can eat fresh vegetables, they also have horses that Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow use to ride through the woods on their property. Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow found a quiet spot as they sat on the ground taking in nature, she took off her clothes. Knight Shadow watching his wife smiling at her body.  "And what are you planning?" he asked as he realized he was completely naked.  "I plan on riding you big guy." She told him pushing him back kissing him as they began to enjoy the feel of each others bodies as she sat on top of him." Getty up horsy." She smiled moving back and forth slowly driving him crazy. Their passions were building higher and hotter when lightening bolts began striking in different directions. Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow sat up quickly looking around. "Oh shit! We're under attack!" she yelled jumping up to her feet changing into her warrior's uniform as did Knight Shadow. They appeared in the house seeing Mystic caster had the children fleeing up to the room with Guardian Caster.  Mystic Shadow knew there were too many of the Dark side getting past the shield looking up at her daughter. "Go to Father Quick!" she yelled watching them vanish knowing they would be safe there.  "Lightening Caster has been hit by an electrical ball from a huge demon!" Kathy told them with chaos was breaking out around them.  Mystic Shadow using her powers sent her to her father where Mystic caster and Guardian caster had escaped with the children. Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow ran out of the house seeing the lightening bolts striking demons, but hundreds of others were managing to get through.  Shadow caster carried Lightening Casters body to them crying tears of pain and anguish. "He didn't make it." He said crying looking down at his fallen friend.  Mystic Shadow sent him to Guardian caster. "There still may be time to bring him back." She told him praying he could be saved.  All of the warriors were battling the demons trying to destroy as many as they could, but they kept coming in flocks. Mystic Shadow was not going to lose one more warrior to them, she began spinning like an F six tornado which is an unconceivable tornado, her winds were up to 319 – 379 mile per hour, sending lightening bolts down striking each of the demons coming on the grounds when Mystic caster returned to avenge her husbands death, she too began spinning up into the air as her mother with just as much force sending fire bombs down on the demons as Knight Shadow , Shadow Caster and the rest of the warriors soared through the air dropping potions to destroy the ones they missed. They all floated above the ground to make sure all were destroyed before they vanished. Mystic Shadow left the land and the cabin to Lisa and her Grand mother whose house was in need of major repair. She signed the note from your Guardian Angel along with the deed. Lisa never moved from the house, her Grand mother lived to be ninety nine years old, Lisa and her husband watched as fairies sprinkled their magical dust over her body watching her spirit soar to heaven.  China Winters a thirty year old woman, with shoulder length light brown hair, dark brown eyes, very thin with hardly any chest became interested in witch craft, demons anything on the supernatural beings. She began to decorate her house from the 1600's buying antique furniture along with paintings of demons hanging through out the house, one was displayed on the wall in front of her bed, she would lay gazing at the painting feeling that his red glowing eyes were actually watching her until she succumb to sleep. He was huge in size and height, his skin coloring was the darkest black she had ever seen with bright yellow short stripes that started from the top of his head to his feet. Un aware that he was actually a demon that a witch had placed him in the painting for eternity as punishment for his savage attacks on women, the painting was to be locked inside of a vault in an abandoned house from years ago, someone bought the house setting the painting out for any one to take it. The painting had been stored in a cave one hundred years ago until discovered by a camper; the camper taking it home sold it in a yard sale. The person who bought it said evil things began to happen after they got the portrait. They quickly get rid of it. The witch added to her spell only the love of a young maiden could free him from his damnation to the portrait. He would watch her sleep thinking of how he would love to torture her before savagely killing her. She became even more obsessed with the picture standing in front of him running her fingers over his body lightly just staring at him with a blank look for hours. He felt the light touch of her fingers tormenting him where he was helpless being held a prisoner in this picture where he could not satisfy his hunger for women.  China and her friends went out drinking on the town going from bar to bar hoping to find a man. Since her friend Molly was very obese with facial scars from acne as a teen, she had brown curly hair. Thinking she would be picked up by a man wearing her red half shirt and short skirt with red heels that looked as if they were cutting her circulation off at her ankles. Jennie who had long blond hair, thick rimmed glasses over her blue eyes with heavy make up on, She and China had Olive oils body, she wore a blue short dress, the top had straps going around her neck, exposing her bony back, wearing blue spiked heels, China had dressed identical to her except that her outfit was red. They drank most of the night with men ignoring them paying attention only to the beautiful women with breast. They went back to Chinas apartment looking at all her paintings when in her bedroom they came to Arion the demon, Molly looked at the picture.  "Damned with that huge organ he has I'd let him fuck me no matter how ugly he is." She said rubbing his penis. "He'd choke you to death if you gave him oral." She said laughing as she kept touching his penis.  I would cut your fat off and let you watch me eat it as you choked to death as I forced you to give me oral sex you bitch! He thought to himself as he was feeling aroused and helpless to do anything about it. Damn you witch for keeping me alive in this painting!  "Not if you did it like this." Jenny told them taking her tongue licking the portrait slowly up and down his penis.  Do not stop bitch; do not stop. He thought, as he was very aroused now. I would grab you by the back of your head making you take it all the way in your mouth before ripping you apart while alive.  "You think its twelve inches?" China asked looking at the picture as it was making her sexually aroused looking at it.  He looked at her for he found him self strangely attracted to her. You I would pleasure keeping you around as my slave. He thought looking into her eyes as she stared back into his.  "Well we are going to go now, have fun thinking of that big thing fucking your brains out." Molly told her as they left.  She stood before the picture dropping her dress in front of the picture, touching her small breast; she took her hand touching his penis. "I wish I could fuck you, I am so hot for you," she told the picture lying on her bed as she pleasured her self-looking at his painting.  He watched her touching her body, her hips moving as she thought of him exploding into such a climax.  It tortured him even more knowing he could not even release his sexual frustration. Then he thought if she were to start dreaming of me she would fall in love with me releasing me. He smiled, as he would soon be out to fuck her and killing her two friends.  She fell to sleep when she began to dream she was lying in front of the picture pleasuring her self when he stepped out of the painting coming to her, removing her hand she had between her thighs.  "Let me please you my love." He told her raising his body over hers and entering her.  The pain was excruciating at first, but then she felt pleasure as he was kissing her mouth, neck, sucking on small breast. "I love you China. If you loved me I could come out of the picture to make love to you all the time." He told her lying just to get his freedom." Do you love me? Tell me now." He said feeling she was going to climax.  "I love you Arion!" She screamed out.  "And now I am going to fuck you!" he said jumping out of the picture.  Her eyes opened seeing him coming to her bed. "You want this and now I am going to give it you!" he told her grabbing her hand placing it on his penis.  "your real." she told him feeling fear go through her body. He jumped on top of her kissing her with a foul odor coming from his mouth, her nipples were hard from him sucking on them, her body began to move and groan when he rammed him self into her as she gasped from the pain then pleasure just like the dream.  "You belong to me, you are my slave. I will kill you if you disobey me." He told her as she climaxed.  "I will be back I must feast, be in the bed waiting for me to pleasure me." He told her.  He appeared in Molly's bedroom where she laid sleeping in the nude smiling down at his food. He laid on top of her sodomizing her as he ripped her flesh from her back devouring it . The severity of the pain caused her to pass out as he kept feeding on her flesh when he reached an orgasm. Rolling her over on to her stomach, he began ripping off more flesh eating it hungrily. She opened her eyes in severe pain, he sat straddled across her chest. She looked horrified seeing the demon in the picture on top of her forcing his penis down her throat ramming it in until she suffocated to death.  He lay down next to Jenny as she opened her eyes to scream he covered her mouth. "Why don't you show me how you will lick me?" he asked as he had his hand between her thighs smiling watching her fear fade. "Tell you what, I will lick you first." He told her going down on her until she exploded into a climax. "Now it's your turn." He told her as she began licking him when he took her head pushing him self as far as he could go down her throat ripping her arm off as this got him more excited until he had her body parts completely ripped off of her, when he climaxed ripping her chest open, she was still alive ripping her heart out and eating it. "Thanks for helping a demon out." He told her disembodied corpse laughing as he vanished; he returned at China's apartment.  "You will have to meet new friends, preferably nice big fat girls like Molly." He told her smiling then taking her with such force.  Each time he had sex with her it seemed she became more obsessed with pleasing him. He was constantly hitting her, her eyes began to show dark circles as her skin tone became a grayish white, she only wore black clothing, he was turning her into one of the living dead by sucking the life force out of her aura. Her life as known before was gone, she now belonged to the Dark side. She would only make friends with obese women so he could go and attack them viciously to feed his sadistic need to feed on flesh while sodomizing the women as he began on their backs just as he killed Molly.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © The pain knocked them out before the visions could get to Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster. His method worked for they always showed a few minutes after he left. They could not even summons him for he had blocked any powers getting to him with the help of an evil witch, she placed a shield around him that made him almost non existent, the Dark side did not want to lose again one of their fiercest evil warriors.  Mystical Lightening was sitting in the garden at the house her mother grew up in for protection, the twins were ten years old now. She could hear her mother and grandmother talking about how to get to this evil demon killing these women. She had the powers to hear even if the person was twenty miles away from her.  "Mommy his name is Arion and Great grandma's sister Angel shadow placed him in a painting never to come out." She told the two women who had a look of shock on their faces.  "How do you know this?" Mystic Shadow asked her.  "I heard you talking while I was in the garden and I saw it, and he lives with a lady who is dead, but alive?" she said questioning herself for she did not understand that part. "Her name is China, he lives with her at 105 55 street apartment 2." She told them as if it was nothing to know this information. Her psychic abilities were beyond what most psychics had.  "Thank you baby!" Mystic caster told her giving her a kiss on her fore head." When daddy comes home tell him mommy and Grand mommy went to take care of Arion." She told Mystical Lightening.  Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster appeared in the bedroom where he was making China perform oral sex on him. China sat with her back turned towards the witches and he had his eyes closed.  "Oh stop before I lose my breakfast." Mystic Shadow told them.  China stood up from the bed slowly looking at them expressionless; Arion sat up in the bed smiling. "Well, well if it isn't the mother and daughter team. Why don't you join me in bed before I fucking kill you?" He said still smiling then threw two firebombs at them that Mystic caster blew it out before it reached them.  "You need to catch up with the times," she told him sending an electric ball at China electrocuting her before blowing her up. "I don't like demon groupies." She said smiling at Arion.  At the same time, Mystic Shadow cast him back into the picture as he was screaming and struggling not to go back into it. She walked up to the picture taking her finger running down his chest knowing he could feel when someone touched the picture. "Yes you big bad demon, I put you back in your picture to live in for eternity, but this time I am going to change a few lines." She told him smiling when suddenly he reached through the painting grabbing her by the throat choking her. She quickly burnt his hand with hers. She quickly grabbed his hand shoving it back in to the picture. "You really are a pain in the neck! " she said gathering her self together to cast the spell, " I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light, order that this vile creature spend eternity in this picture perfect prison, nothing can release him for that is my decision, in this picture he will always dwell, burning for eternity in the lake of hell." She said blowing him up. His screams could be heard until he had completely vanished.  When they returned Knight Shadow, Lightening caster and Shadow caster was trying to beat the other in throwing distance, they throw electric balls with Flame caster, but the boy was showing them up badly.  "Watch this one." He said with a smile as he threw a huge flaming ball that hit his great grand father's favorite gazebo blowing it up. His eyes got big as he saw Fire caster walking out of the smoke. "uh oh." He said looking at the black smut on Fire casters face and body, his hair standing up wildly on his head, his white suit now gray." That was a great throw there lad, just kindly aim at other things that are not buildings or anything else of that nature." He told him smiling as he walked to his cottage to change into a clean white suit as well as cleaning him self-up.  "Yes sir, I am sorry." He said trying not to laugh.  The grown ups were a different story as they busted out in laughter. Fire caster felt they should be made an example for the children, he dumped buckets of mud over Mystic Shadow, Mystic caster, Knight Shadow, Lightening Caster, Shadow Caster and Kathy's heads.  They all looked at him." Sorry." they all said in unison as the mud ran down their bodies while Fire Caster and the children laughed at the adults who stood looking shocked.  "Now that is funny." Fire Caster said laughing as he rebuilt the gazebo with his powers and he made a target range that would tell the speed and distance Flame caster could throw.  Flame caster turned to look at Kathy smiling." Kathy your wish has been granted." He told the woman who looked confused.  "My wish?" she asked him wondering to her self if he heard what she had just thought?  "Yes I did Kathy, try lifting something by concentrating on it." He told her smiling.  Kathy concentrated on lifting the flower box and it began to rise, she looked stunned." how did you do that?" she asked.  "You wished to be a witch of the white light, a warrior I granted your wish, so now you're a witch." He said smiling.  They realized he had the abilities to grant wishes as a Genie, which would be good as long as there were not any repercussions either. His abilities to grant wishes are for those who are good and not asking for riches and fame.  That night as Flame Caster lay in his bed sleeping he heard the weeping of Martha and Harold Langley who just found out their five year old daughter Samantha had chronic heart disease with only six weeks to live. They wished they could take her to Disney world where she had always wanted to go to the magic kingdom, but they could hardly make their bills. The next day Martha got the mail inside of an envelope, were free passes to take Samantha to Magic Kingdom all expenses paid including their food and room at one of Disney's resorts.  "Oh my God, we were just talking about this last night! We must have an Angel watching over us." She said aloud to her self .  The little brown haired girl who was growing weaker as the days went by smiled as her parents pushed her in a wheel chair through the Magic Kingdom, her big brown eyes showed the happiness in them for they sparkled something that had been missing for sometime.  Flame Caster could not get the little girl out of his head telling Mystical Lightening about her two weeks later after granting the young girls wish.  "Why should we allow her to die? I have the healing power. " she told him.  "We can't leave here you know ,there are evil beings wanting to kill us." He told her.  "We don't have to watch." She told him as she stood up in the middle of her bedroom." I mystical Lightening grand daughter of the high priestess Mystic Shadow wish to have my tears delivered to Samantha Langley who has a chronic heart disease for the tears to fall softly on her face erasing the disease without any trace." She chanted as tears fell from her eyes.  Samantha slept while sprinkles of Mystical Lightening fell upon the Childs face as she began to glow a brilliant white light. The next morning she woke up with strength that she had not ever felt before, running to her mother smiling.  "I feel great mommy!" she told her mother standing in their kitchen.  Her mother called the doctor who wanted to examine her finding nothing wrong; her heart was beating, as a healthy heart should. They ran test finding nothing.  "She's cured. I don't know how but she is going to live a very long life." The doctor told the parents.  When the story of the little girl's miracle hit the news, it reinforced the innocents of their belief in their God and having those who did not believe to become firm believers. This caused great anger amongst the dark side for now they were more determined to get more souls and by doing so, they would create distrust among the mortals by starting scandals in their churches starting with the Christian schools. They would send in their demons as Christian teachers to teach the teenager's who were the most vulnerable to lead a stray. Of course it would become public knowledge that the faith they put their trust in were molesting their beloved teenager's. One teacher would not do much harm, but hundreds from all over the world would cast doubt in their faiths, just what the dark side wanted.  Christina Phelps a thirty four year old high school teacher who specialized in math. showed up at the interview wearing a blue skirt that fit loose to her mid calf, a white shirt buttoned up to her neck, a blue blazer with very little make up, her long hair wore up in a bun.  "You seem very much what we are looking for here at Christian youth school. Now you will be teaching eighteen and nineteen-year-old boys and girls who we know are the age that they could be tempted into having forbidden sexual relations before marriage, the use of drugs and alcohol. They are at the age where they can be led into temptation." The principle of the school told her.  "I know exactly what you mean; they can be led into committing sinful acts at this tender age." She smiled at him so sweetly. That is exactly what I am hoping for. She thought to her self.  The next morning she wore a bright yellow sleeveless mid calf dress that fit just slightly loose, still showing off her luscious body, with white heels as the principle introduced her to the class. After he left, she walked around the room checking over the boys and girls she would be seducing into sex, drugs, and satanic rituals. During the day when a male student needed help she made sure that one of her breast touched the side of his face smiling down at him so the rest of the time he was concentrating on her body, wondering if she had meant for it to happen. She sat on top of her desk she implanted in each of the boys minds sexual thoughts of her with them, she'd walk by each one giving them a seductive look. She noticed by the end of the school day Mark a eighteen year old, with wavy short brown hair, fair complexion, who was thin and very tall had not lost the erection he gotten from thinking of her giving him oral sex.  "Mark would you mind staying after class? I would like to speak with you to that I think will help you." She said smiling at him still sitting at his desk trying to cover his erection so no one would see it. After standing by the door telling the entire student's good-bye she smiled pleasingly at the boys looking at her body passing by her, she had succeeded with the first temptation called lust. She locked the door behind her without Mark knowing. Christina walked back to Mark sitting at his desk, where she stood behind him leaning over so her breast was pressed up against the back of his neck, as she pointed to the paper smiling she could see how well endowed he was by his erection.  "What do we have here?" she asked placing her hand on his erection rubbing it softly she heard him inhale deeply." You're so well endowed for your age." She told him with her lips touching his ear she kept moving her hand over his penis." Does it feel good Mark?" she asked him in a whisper kissing his ear.  The young boy nodded his head." stand up Mark." She told him kissing his neck.  Mark stood in front of her, he had never had sex except to a magazine he found at his friends house, it showed different sex acts performed. She took his hands placing them on her breast having him to touch her entire body; she began to kiss his lips running her tongue slowly over his lips. Getting down on her knees, she performed oral sex on him until he exploded.  He fell back into his desk breathing heavy." Oh wow that was great." He said looking at her smiling.  "Come to my house and we will go swimming." She told him kissing him passionately." I want to have real sex with you." She told him still kissing him hungrily. "Here is my address I will be expecting you at six this evening." She told him placing his hand inside of her thong so he could feel her moistness with her dress pulled up around her waist.  That evening Mark showed up in swimming trunks, he could not believe how hot she was in the white bikini that just barely covered her breast the bottoms were a thong. He began to get an erection just looking at her body, he followed her to the pool watching her drop her suit to ground going in naked, he did the same going into the pool embarrassed of the erection he had.  "Don't be embarrassed it's natural for that to happen." She told him not being able to wait to take his virginity completely away from him, making her beliefs become his which was pure evil.  "Isn't this a sin?" he asked her as she placed her nude body against him kissing and licking his neck.  "Did it make you feel bad when I gave your big boy oral sex?" she asked holding his penis in her hand touching her body all over with it." does this feel bad?" she asked taking his hand placing it between her thighs..  "No, it felt really great, I like you touching me and touching your body." He told her as his breathing was becoming heavy.  "Only sin feels bad, so this can't be a sin." She told him wrapping her arms around his neck, placing both hands on her breast  "All the other teachers say to lust or masturbate is a sin." He told her caressing her breast as she taught him how to do it the way a woman likes it." I am sorry." He told her feeling embarrassed that he ejaculated inside of her.  "what time do you have to be home?" she asked smiling at him as she kissed him being very much aroused now.  "Eleven." He told her she made him feel desires he never had before; even masturbating to his book compared nothing to this.  "We have plenty of time to study then." She told him taking his hand and leading him up stairs to her bedroom.  She told him how to please a woman, with soft kisses all over their lips, necks, breast, running his tongue down her stomach teaching him to perform oral on a woman. The sounds of her moans, her hips moving when she let out a loud moan reaching her orgasm, her body arched. This lesson excited him even more with her sitting on top of him moving slowly pleasuring them both as they exploded together in a climax.  This was the first day that the dark side began to teach these innocent children, the beginning of teaching of their satanic rituals with these unsuspecting teenagers. Sex played a major part for demons in their rituals and they would guide these children all over the world with a demon placed in each Christian school. For this marked the first day that each demon had taken one of their student's virginity.  The second day of school for Mark was just as exciting as the first knowing what they had done together the day before, watching her move, remembering her naked body, her touches, the orgasms. He could not wait until tonight.  Christina had other ideas though that did not include Mark, but Julie Randall was her next victim. Mark did not think much of it since she was a girl. Christina massaged the girls shoulders as she sat at her desk feeling her relax with her.  Once alone in the class room Christina kept massaging the girls shoulders. "Let's go swimming at my house." She said smiling at the girl who was over weight and all the students made fun of her.  "Ok ,but I need to pick up a suit." She told her teacher.  "No you don't, we're both girls we can swim in the buff." She told her smiling as she grabbed her by the hand.  Once at her house they stood by the pool dropping their clothes to the ground, the girl looked at her teachers body, Christina swam up to her.  "I find you very pretty with your blond hair, and those blue eyes." She told her then kissed her lightly on her lips.  The girl felt panicked." I better go." She said trying to get away from her teacher, feeling she was being sexually threatened.  Christina stopped her placing her body up against her. "Wait, just give me five minutes and then if you want to still leave you can. I find you attractive." She said touching her face." I would not do anything that would hurt you.  "Alright I will stay, but I can leave if I want too." She told her teacher  "You have a deal." She told the girl kissing her softly, touching her breast, causing Julie to feel a strange desire inside of her body; she began to kiss her back as Christina placed Julie's hand on both of her breast.  "I want to take you to my bedroom so I can make you feel more desires." Christina told Julie putting her hand between her thighs.  Julie liked the way Christina was making her feel. "alright." she told her kissing her back softly.  Christina took the young girl to her bed where Julie experienced orgasms, Christina taught her how to please her as well. Christina convinced Julie that what they did was not wrong, it was the thinking of the other teachers that were wrong and that is why they had to keep quiet, and meeting only once in awhile. Other wise if they found out they would make sure they were never to see each other and branding each of them as evil sinners.  John Trent a tall, slightly built black male age thirty six, five feet eight inches tall, very well built, who was teaching in another school. He had spotted his victim, Tammy White, a eighteen-year-old girl who was very endowed her breast being a thirty-six d. The rest of the girls were not quite as large, she had a nice build even in the white short sleeve shirt with the blue and black plaited skirt, white knee high socks and black shoes that laced. She wore her long blond hair down with a blue headband. John Trent planted images of her and him having sex on his desk where she began to daydream about it. He could see her nipples getting hard. He smiled knowing she was getting primed for him to make his move after class.  She would catch herself wondering why she was having these wicked thoughts about her teacher. She did not stop it because thinking of him made her feel strange, but good. After class, he asked her if she would stay, he needed to speak with her about her grades. She sat at her desk nervous not seeing him locking the door as he walked up to her desk.  "You are doing really great, but I feel that if you and I work a little together we could turn your B's to an A+." He told her looking down at her he could tell she was thinking of him sexually as he spoke to her." You look so tense let me massage your shoulders," he told her going behind her desk.  He began slowly feeling her breathing become heavier, he slowly moved down her chest watching her getting aroused, he placed both hands on her breast, she laid her head against him wanting him to touch her more. Taking her hand pulling her up to him she could feel his erection against her. She wrapped her arms around his neck kissing each other while he was taking off her clothes and his. He led her to his chair sitting her on his lap; he entered her taking her virginity. He fondled her breast kissing them, taking his hands placing them on her hips moving them to bring them both into a climax. Muffling her mouth with his so her moans of pleasure would not be heard.  "Can you come to my house? I want to do so much more to you." He told her kissing her.  "Yes I will go with you." She told him thinking this was love.  Once in his bedroom he had her on the bed where he preformed oral sex on her driving her crazy until she exploded." If you love me as much as I do you then show me like I just showed you." He told her smiling explaining how to do it.  The next day she could only think of him making her feel so good understanding why they had to be careful. After school he asked a nineteen year old boy name Luke Black to come to his house to mow his yard, once at his house he gave him a drink with a drug in it to make him sexually aroused so he could have the dark haired boy with blue eyes who was very thin and tall. John began massaging Luke's back, before to long the drug took effect on him, he became aroused, he felt strange being aroused by his teacher. John turned him around seeing his erection pinning him against the wall kissing him and then taking him to the bedroom where they had sex for hours. John at the end took him with anal sex as the boy pleaded for him to stop, but John enjoyed inflicting pain on the young boy. He continued until he was full filled.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © After six moths the dark side plans were working, the demons had started their occults through out the world. Their rituals involved sexual rituals with one another. At their rituals, they sacrificed small animals. Drugs so they could gain mind control, their followers began to get the other teenagers in their schools to join by seducing them as their teachers did to them, then having them to join the new religion. Teenagers over the world were acting strange, beating on their parents, raping their siblings, shooting people with out cause. Not one person asked for help making the White light warriors helpless to put an end to it.  Tammy walked into Travis's bedroom who was sleeping, he worked nights while his wife worked days, his wife a heavy woman with gray hair, he was thin with graying hair. Knowing the house was empty Tammy slipped into bed with her father naked, she began an oral seduction on him waking him up to see his daughter pleasuring him, he tried to stop her knowing this was wrong, it was incest, but she kept kissing him, touching him, he was weak giving into the temptation. He and his wife had stopped having relations years ago making it hard for him to fight off the lust he had been feeling every day looking at her body, masturbating thinking of her so many times and now his fantasies had come true he told him self for justifying his lust for his own child. He had sex with her for hours, lusting over her developed body, Tammy allowed him to perform whatever kind of sex on her that his wife would not allow him to do. He would come home from work kiss his wife good bye as she went to work. Going straight to the shower where Tammy was waiting naked, carrying her to the bed having sex with her. They talked of marriage and getting her pregnant, forgetting it is illegal to have sex with your child much less to marry your child. Their relationship went on for three months, they were in the bed performing oral sex on each other not knowing his wife and her mother walked into the bedroom as she had started to suspect something was going on, but she never suspected this!  "Your creatures of the devil!" she yelled at her husband and daughter.  Tammy jumped from the bed with hickies covering her body, Tammy smiling walked up to her mother." My teacher at your so called Christian school, he taught me well, if you're jealous I will fuck you too." She told her mother smiling grabbing one of her mothers breast, moving her tongue provocative at her when her mother slapped her hard across the face, the two began fighting. Tammy grabbing her mother by her shirt pulling her close to her smiling evilly at her ." He likes how I suck him, fuck him, and we are getting married. "Tammy told her grinning." Oh yes one more thing mommy dear, we are going to have a baby!" she yelled at her mother standing at the edge of the stairs. The look of horror all over her face, she could not believe what she was hearing looking at Tammy as if her daughter was possessed.  "I can't stand here chit chatting with you mother, I have to go finish fucking my daddy, something that you haven't had with him in years. Now I am getting it all!" she yelled." I hope your have a nice trip though mommy." She told her smiling and then pushed her mother down the stairs snapping her neck. Tammy laughed at her mother's dead body then turned around going back to her father who had been waiting for her to return." Mommy went away for good." She told him kissing him as she sat on top of him moving her body teasingly smiling when she felt him get erect again; evil had consumed their souls with no return from their damnation for eternity. They let her dead mother lay there for three hours before calling to report her accident saying he was sleeping.  "How do you want to be punished this time?" he asked smiling fondling his daughter.  "You choose the pain." She said smiling at him as she got on her hands and knees." make it hurt real good daddy, I am a nasty girl." She said as they laughed together  Her mothers death was ruled accidental, at the funeral they request sometime alone with her mother closing the doors she stood bent over looking at her dead mother "you should have joined us instead of staying with the so called good people and you'd still be alive today." Tammy told her mother's corpse.  They were married by John, the ceremony was followed by their ritual of sex with the others, it was John who had the liberty to have sex with the bride dressed in a black wedding dress taking her with brutal force, Her father had sex with a thirteen year old girl who had been brought into their new church by her eighteen year old cousin Jason who taught her about pleasing him sexually at the tender age of nine. The rest also joined the ritual.  Five years later they still had not been caught seducing the teenagers in the Christian schools. They were feeling as if they were now invincible to the white light and its warriors or anything representing good in the world. eighteen year old Lacy Weather spoon began school at the Christian school with Christina as her teacher. Christina looked the girl over thinking to herself she couldn't wait to have her join their church watching how she had the perfect shape, nice bust and very nice rear. As soon as school was dismissed Christina asked the girl to join her for swimming just as she had with all the other females. Lacy agreed pinning her shoulder length brown hair up with a clip as they walked out to Christina's car. Once at the pool Christina told her." I don't wear suits, but if you feel uncomfortable I'll get you get you a long shirt." She smiled at her so sweetly.  "It's ok we're both females and I don't think your weird or anything." She told Christina smiling feeling safe that her teacher was not a molester.  "Want a drink?" Christina asked her looking at her taking off her clothes. Drug time! I am having sex with that perfect body today. She thought to her self as she went to go get the drinks.  Lacy drank her soda down fast she was so thirsty." Wow that tasted funny." She told her looking at the can.  "Really? Mine is fine." She said sitting the can down.  As they swam in the pool she began planting thoughts of sex acts with her in Lucy's mind, she kept trying to push the images out of her mind. Christina swam up to her.  "Are you alright?" Christina asked her touching her face lightly sending an irresistible urge through Lucy's body to kiss Christina's hand. Smiling as the young girl began to kiss her hand Christina pulled her body up to hers kissing the girl passionately.  Christina led her upstairs to her bed where she made the young girl have sex with her until Christina was completely satisfied with her.  Once Lacy was home she felt sick to her stomach for what happened to her, knowing she had to be drugged. She began Praying for help and protection from this wicked woman. Enchantress Caster appeared in her room.  "I am here to help you." She told the young girl who looked at her with fear in her face." I was sent here because of your prayer." She told her standing in her white light uniform.  Lacy cried telling her what happened to her by her teacher at her house when they went swimming. Enchantress Caster looked at her  Sadly for the young girl had been violated. Enchantress Caster changed into regular clothes.  " I think it's time we pay her a visit." She said smiling.  "You have magical powers?" she asked looking at Enchantress Caster so surprised.  "I am a warrior of the white light who protects those who are innocent and want our help." She told her. "In others words a good witch. Now are you ready little sister?" she asked her smiling.  They appeared in Christina's bedroom that was lying in her bed with the Principle of the school having sex with him.  "Not very Christian like now is it?" Enchantress Caster asked the couple who sat up quickly in bed." I am here to kick your ass for the rape of this child!" she told them angrily.  "Who the fuck are you?" Christina asked Enchantress Caster.  "Oh I am sorry, where are my manners? This is who I am." She told them changing into her warrior uniform. "Enchantress caster warrior of the white light power.  They both threw fire balls at her making her laugh; she caught them in her hand looking at them then blew them out." Now you just went and pist me off! I enchantress caster sister of Mystic shadow the High Priestess cast these two pass hell to the one whose appetite is for evil souls he desires to feed for these demons and their evil deeds. For I cast this spell and ask the higher power to break any hold that they and their counter parts may have on the innocents they have forced to be one with them, I ask that they be cast them far from hell, But to the place that he dwells!" she chanted as the two demons blew up, as did the rest who were demons through out the world involved in this evil seduction of the children in the Christian schools. For those who were still innocent they were able to seek counseling trying to live a normal life, their faith in their God restored even stronger. For those who still worship the dark side are in the prison systems through out the world. Including Tammy and her Father, their child was placed for adoption. There were hundreds of teachers who gave into temptation willingly and for those who fought unknown to the public they were killed and replaced with a demon. It was the biggest scandal to hit all the papers for the dark side, for once again good prevailed. Lacy grew up to be a prosecuting attorney locking away as many of the evil mortal's that she could.  The fair lady a very powerful fairy who often changes shapes from horses to a beautiful woman in a white dress with long brown hair, but most of the time as a naked woman traveling from town to town seeking shelter. Who ever gives her shelter for the night she would cast a spell making something happen to them from turning dumb or something much worse. She appeared in front of a newly wed couple Rodney and Shannon who hadn't been married a month, Rodney a heavy set man with black hair and brown eyes who always wore plaid shirts and blue jeans with brown work boots opened the door to see the beautiful naked woman standing there." Uh Shannon come here, hurry honey." He called for his wife trying not to look at the woman's nakedness.  Shannon came to the door in her night gown and robe, she had short brown hair and she was heavy set, seeing the beautiful naked woman that her husband was now looking at intently. "What do you want?" she asked irritated thinking this was a joke by one of her friends.  "Please someone has stolen my clothes from me, my money; I am not around from here. Now I am with no place to stay as they were taking me to my destination and instead robbed me of everything." She told them crying.  "Of course you can stay here." Shannon told her feeling sorry for her.  The Fairy lady cast a spell that would change their lives for ever from that night on. They showed her where she would sleep and then left her alone. As the couple sat watching television Rodney asked his wife for a sandwich feeling very irritable for no apparent reason towards her.  "I'll fix it as soon as a commercial comes on." She told him smiling at her husband.  "You lazy bitch! I said now! Not when a commercial comes on! Get up and do it now!" he screamed at her, his face was turning red with veins protruding out of his neck.  Shannon looked at him like he was a stranger out of the five years they lived together before getting married. He had never been a violent person. "What is wrong with you?" she asked him confused by the way he was acting.  "I guess you need to be shown where the fucking kitchen is?" he yelled at her banging his fist on the arm of the couch.  Suddenly he jumped up from the couch pouncing on top of Shannon sitting in the recliner; the force of him pouncing on top of her sent them and the chair back wards on the floor. He began to beat her with his fist in her face, breaking her arms when she tried to protect her face from his punches. He stood up dragging her body on the floor into the kitchen by her hair; he forced her to her feet then smashed her face into the refrigerator over and over with all of his strength breaking every bone in her face.  "This is where we keep the damn lunch meat you dumb bitch!" He screamed at her smashing her face again with brut force into the refrigerator.  As if that was not enough he threw her on the ground kicking her, jumping on her head, back, and legs like a mad man until he was grabbed by police officers who busted in the kitchen door because a neighbor witnessed the brutal beating through her kitchen window facing theirs.  The officers grabbed him throwing him to the ground and hand cuffing him. "is there anyone else in the house?" the tall officer asked him finding it hard to look at the mangled woman lying bloodied on the floor, in his twenty years of police work he had never seen an attack so viciously that it made a person look like a monster from a movie.  "There is some bitch upstairs that I would have fucked if you guys hadn't stopped me from getting rid of this trash!" he yelled.  The officers checked the entire house to find there was not a soul in the house, and the room Rodney told them she was in had been boarded up. They broke in fearing he may have killed her before beating his wife. The room was full of cobwebs and thick dust; no one had been in there for years.  Shannon survived the attack, having to be tube fed, she was paralyzed from the neck down, her voice box was smashed so severely it was beyond hope. She had massive brain damage; she did not have any family members to take care of her, she had to be placed in a care facility.  Rodney was put to death two years to the date of the attack.  The Fair Lady appeared at a large ranch as a beautiful black horse running up to the owner of the ranch Paul Wright a twenty six year old self made millionaire, married with two young children, he was extremely physically fit, he had been told he looked like a young George Strait. " hey there girl, how did you get here?" he said patting the horse. "Anyone know who this horse belongs to?" he asked his ranch hands but no one had any idea.  "well I guess we have a guest until we find her owners ." he told them leading her to the stalls where he placed her an empty one giving her horse feed , hay and water.  Paul was walking out to help his ranch hands to break a horse when he suddenly fell to the ground, the ranch hands ran to him where he laid staring blankly up at the sky. Steve his brother ran to call for the ambulance. When they arrived, they pronounced Paul dead. The coroner ruled the death as a massive coronary. The next day when Steve went to feed the horses, the black beauty had mysteriously vanished.  The Fair Lady wearing the white dress stood in front of a small white house with a picket fence with roses growing around the fence, two rocking chairs on the front porch, sitting in one was an eighty eight year old woman dressed in a dark blue dress with small white flowers on it. She approached the woman slowly.  "I am stranded here in town, I haven't any money and was wondering since night time is approaching if I may stay the night until morning?" she asked the kind old woman  The old woman smiled like an angel at her." Why yes you can dear, I just sit here waiting for my Charlie to come and take me home with him one day. That was my Charlie's rocking chair; we would sit here and just rock together. I continue our rocking. How I miss him." The old woman told the mysterious woman as tears filled the old woman's eyes.  That night as the old woman slept in her bed she was awakened by Charlie standing over her bed." Come dear it's time to go home." He told her taking her hand as they began to walk and vanish. Still laying in her bed was her body with a smile of happiness on it.  The Fair Lady showed up in the woods where there were boy scouts camping out deep in the thick woods, she approached them in her white dress." I have gotten lost in the dark out here. May I stay at your camp until morning so I can find my way out?" she asked as three adults and children sat around the fire.  "Yes, we can't have you wondering around the woods." The male told her looking at her body smiling.  The older woman smiled, her own shadow scared her and trusted no one. The wife looked at her with jealousy then showed her a tent she could sleep in.  The next morning the boy scouts were found wondering down the road, they could not talk but refused to go back into the woods for whatever they saw scared them speechless. When the authorities found the camping spot, they found the remains of the adults scattered around the camp, large footprints that looked like some kind of creature, they were not familiar with and it walked on two feet. When they got one boy to draw what it looked like they drew a demon like creature very large. With long fang like teeth and claws on its fingers and toes.  The Fair Lady showed up in a cabin in the mountains naked where two brothers lived. When the one brother opened the door he could not believe his eyes." Joe, come here! Look at this!" Tommy yelled.  His brother Joe came to the door and saw the naked woman. "Damn girl, what are you doing out here naked?" he asked.  "This man gave me a ride and tried to rape me, I just kept running until I saw your cabin." She told them crying.  With the same intentions for her, they let her in and then both of them grabbed her and raped her as the other one held her down taking turns half the night with her, when they were done forcing her to have sex with them they threw her into a closet and locked it so she could not escape. They planned to keep her around to pleasure them until they got tired of her and then would kill her. The next morning they got up to fix something to eat when they opened the closet to throw her in a plate it was empty.  "What the fuck?" Joe asked looking at the empty closet.  "What is she dead?" asked Tommy thinking she might have suffocated in the closet.  "Its worse, she is gone!" Joe yelled looking around to see how she could have gotten out. "Fuck! She will go to the authorities!" he yelled running out side to find there were not even footprints on the damp morning ground.  They waited all day for the authorities to show up, but no one came. Later that night there was a knock on the door. They opened the door thinking the law finally came. They were surprised to see a sexy blonde-haired woman standing there in black tight leather one-piece pants suits that were strapless just up above her breast with black spiked shoes. The woman pushed her way into the cabin grabbing the men kissing them. They took their clothes off, as did the she. Both men could not believe their luck; she took each man separately into the back room, as soon as their penises enter the woman it felt like acid was eating away their penises. They could not push the she-devil off. The woman was laughing and turned into a hideous demon ripping the two men's flesh off and eating it as the men screamed in terror and horrifying pain. The creature began to rip the men apart, throwing their body parts all over the cabin. She kept them alive until she reached in their chest cavities ripping their pumping hearts out and eating them. The men's decomposed body parts wasn't discovered until three weeks later by their cousin a huge biker, who ran from the cabin in fear of his own life.  The Fair Lady appeared at the door of a Southern Baptist preacher in the middle of the night, the preacher looked at the woman dressed in a white dress. "Is something wrong?" he asked very concern thinking she was in danger.  "I was traveling when two men took my car, wallet; the police said they would look for them. I have no where to stay and something told me to stop here that you might be kind enough to get me off the streets just for tonight." She told him.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © He felt sorry for the young woman and let her sleep on their couch. The next morning she was gone along with the preacher's voice that she had stolen, his wife now had the mind of a three-year-old child.  The warrior's of the White Light had been tracking the Fair Lady for years, but they were always one-step behind her and tonight she stood in front of Samantha's house that was now twelve years old. A black cat ran up on to the porch meowing as Samantha opened the door, looking down at the cat that was looking up at her. A storm had begun to start as lightening striking through the sky.  "Hi kitty, you better come inside for the night there's a horrible storm coming." She told the cat picking her up." We had better go to my room; my parents would not like a cat in the house.  After her parents went to sleep, she snuck down stairs to get some milk and tuna for the cat to eat. "Ok now you eat and I will see you in the morning." She told the cat holding her in her arms then kissed her on top of her head.  As soon as the little girl was a sleep, she jumped up on the bed making sure she was sound to sleep. She wanted the heart that Mystical Lightening healed. The Fair Lady lay on top of the child as her cat eyes glowed purple. The next morning when Samantha's mother came in to wake her daughter, she found her laying on her back with her eyes opened wide with fear as if something scared her to death.  "No! No please Samantha! Wake up baby! Please wake up for mommy. Please Sammy don't leave mommy! I can't live life without my ray of sunshine." She cried taking her daughter into her arms rocking back and forth with her." Why did you take my baby from me! Why my Sammy?" she cried laying her down when her father walked into the room.  "Dear God no!" he cried out in pain falling back into the wall.  The coroner's office told her parents that her heart had exploded; there wasn't any reason for her death, the heart was perfectly healthy.  Her grieving parents arranged for her funeral having her placed in a pink casket with white lining, a long silk pink gown with matching satin slippers. People from all over came to pay their respects and good byes to the miracle child.  Mystical Lightening and Flame Caster were in the garden when Samantha's spirit appeared before them. "The Fair Lady blew my heart up while I was sleeping." She told them "I was told to come here that Mystic shadow would explain to me what was happening." She told them, as she felt very confused.  They led her to their Grandmother who explained the whole story of how they saved her from dying at five and now The Fair Lady killed her by causing her heart to explode to hurt the faith of the innocent and good.  "You made a miracle happen which gave the innocents more support in their belief in good. So they had the Christian children to be seduced, and drugged by the Christian leaders, who started out as demons, then others gave into temptation and the ones who resisted were killed." She explained to them then turning her attention to Samantha. "Samantha you will stay here with us where you will be taught to be a great spiritual warrior because you are the miracle child and the Higher Power has great plans for you." She told her smiling touching her face lightly.  As Mystic shadow was helping, Samantha to understand what had happened to her because Mystical lightening had healed her heart by sending her tears to sprinkle on her face it had infuriated the evil ones." They could not just make your heart stop because of the healing that Mystical lightening had used was to powerful, they took the other alternative by blowing it up."  The twins walked out side reading their minds they showed up standing behind the Fair Lady.  "So what is so fair about you lady?" Mystical lightening asked her.  The Fair Lady turned towards them with glowing eyes, smiling they began to electrocute her with the use of their eyes, their powers together were so powerful her eyes flew out of their sockets, along with her teeth, the rest of her exploded and then they sent her to the one that feeds on evil souls. When they returned Knight Shadow was waiting for them.  "what were you thinking by going out after knowing the Dark Side would love to get a hold of you two?" he yelled at his grand children.  "No disrespect sir, but just because we are seven teen does not mean that we are children." Flame caster replied.  "No it doesn't, but the dark side will retaliate even more vicious now. Just promise me no more taking off by your selves?" he asked them.  "We promise Grand father." They both answered in unison.  The Dark side fumed and ordered that one hundred of their most seductive witches were to replace the women married only to Christian men, bare a child with them then slaughter that child on one of their most religious holiday Christmas eve the day the Christian's savoir was born and Easter day when he had arisen from the dead. Returning the body to the real wife where she would pay for their sins. They had to do as much damage as possible before the great battle in four years when the twins turned twenty one years old and their powers were completely in tact and more powerful then all the nuclear weapons in the worlds armed forces. The Dark Side told the witches to meet the woman in their churches take over their  Bodies while the real wives lay dormant in their own bodies. The witches of course would act as Christians do, only making the husbands lust for them so intensely they end up pregnant in February delivering their babies in November and massacre the infants on Christmas Eve. The other fifty would make sure they conceived and delivered a month before Easter since it changed days and months they had to pay attention. They then would move on to another husband alternating the holidays for their birth for the next four years.  The first fifty evil witches was sent to church that Sunday to chose a wife to replace, once the woman went to the rest room the witch then took over.  Xavier the high witch spotted him, Tom Franklin was a short heavy man, and balding with a thick mustache, what was left of his hair was black. By the look on his wife Connie Franklin's face, she was full of frustration, and slightly over weight. They both were thirty years old. She smiled smugly watching the couple together. I will bet they hardly ever have sex; he will enjoy having me around for a while, I love sex with whatever I can find to put out my fire. She thought to herself. As soon as his wife went to the bathroom Xavier stepped into her body. She came out of the bathroom and sat next to her husband Tom rubbing his thigh close to his penis. That night after dinner she cleaned the kitchen with her magic, then went to the bedroom trying to find something seductive and there was nothing. Using her magic, she wore a black lace see through teddy showing her flesh underneath the out fit, she wore black spiked heels, make up and perfume , she stood looking in the mirror. Thank you for having large breast, which is all you have going for you. She thought to her self and walked out to her husband sitting in his recliner half a sleep. Oh I am going to wake you up. She thought to her self straddling him in the chair.  "Do you like my new outfit?" she asked kissing him softly licking his ears and sucking on his neck.  "I'm not really in the mood." He told her as she placed his hands on her breast.  "Let me get you in the mood then." She told him sliding down his body pushing the chair so he was sitting up. She unzipped his zipper taking her tongue slowly around the head of his penis then began sucking on it.  "You told me this was part of evil, what changed your mind?" He asked, but did not stop her either. "Oh baby. "He said with his eyes closed, his breathing heavy. He was not going to resist her as he was on cloud nine. Pushing the chair back she took him right there in the chair as he fondled her breast, loving this exciting sex with her and not the usual on her back in the bed.  He slept like a baby all night. The next morning she had his breakfast ready when he came into the kitchen and he found she serving it naked as she stood there smiling.  "I want you." She told him massaging her breast." Pull your pants down." She told him laying on the kitchen table as he took her with the passion he never knew before, it felt like he was cheating, she was so different and he was loving it as he heard her scream out from an orgasm.  The men whose wives were replaced with the witches in the other states were all going to work with smiles on their faces for they had sex with their wives like they never did before.  That night when Tom got home he couldn't wait for dinner to be over with. While she cleaned the kitchen he waited in bed naked for her. She walked in smiling. Poor deprived man. She thought to her self.  "What have you always wanted to do sexually?" She asked.  "Tie a woman on her stomach and you know do it where women don't like. "He said nervously.  "Ok, but you have to do me first then you can tie me up." She told him. Straddling him as she thought of him almost creating a rape it turned her on they both climaxed. "Get something to tie me up with, and then throw me on my stomach forcibly and act out the rape." She told him.  He smiled because he had always fantasized about raping women. He threw her roughly on her stomach tying her hands and legs. He was getting so aroused he forcibly stuck his hardness into her anally. He was living out his fantasy." You bitch! Do you like it bitch? I am going to fuck you like this all night." until he exploded inside of her. The rape being so evil, so brutal turned her on. When he came out of the shower they performed oral on each other. As he lay in the bed next to her he looked at her. "Did some alien jump in your body? Because if that is the case please don't leave." He told her holding her in his arms and kissing her passionately.  The witches were to make sure that people noticed the changes in the women. Xavier watched the lawn man Tim, he was tall with muscles rippling all over his body, his head was shaved wearing just a pair of jean shorts with a pair of work boots. "Well I think an affair or just being a pure slut would be a change in character." She told her self smiling looking at the lawn mans body. She changed her house dress into a tight white T shirt with out a bra, tight white jean shorts. "This would be easier if I had a better body to work with instead of lumpy dumpy here." She told her self looking in the mirror at the body she had to work with now when hers was made for seductions.  Walking to the front door she caught his attention by waving her arm at him. The lawn man jumped off the riding lawn mower running to see how he could help her.  "Come inside for a minute please." She told him letting him in the house.  "Yes ma'am is there a problem?" He asked trying to avoid looking at her breast through the thin T shirt, but his eyes kept drifting back to her nipples.  "You look so hot." She told him taking her finger slowly down his chest to the top of his blue jeans just above his pelvic hair stopping then sticking her finger inside of the jeans. "Am I causing a problem?" she asked him seeing the bulge in jeans growing larger.  "You sure are causing a problem to grow bigger." He told her watching her taking her shirt off, he took off his boots and pants.  He pulled her naked body up to his, touching areas that were to be forbidden to another man, taking her in front of the door and having hot steamy sex with this sex crazed woman.  The neighbors who were home noticed his truck was there for three hours that day while he was inside having sexual acts done to him that he never even knew existed. Their affair became a weekly thing for them. Between her lovers once a week, her husband every night she had succeeded in conceiving.  The rest of the evil witches conceived shortly after Xavier and continued their affairs with either their Doctors, mail men, who ever they found to do their dirty deed with.  Tom stopped having sex with Xavier once she began showing, her pregnancy was a huge turn off to him. He would go out at night to local bars where he would watch for a woman who left alone, he would follow the victim to where she lived, and for three days he'd watch the apartment making sure his intended victim lived alone. When he knew she was not home he would ring the door bell to see if she had a dog plus checking for any type of security devices.  His first victim was Sally Holt a thirty year old recent divorcee with long red hair, she was average height, weighed one hundred twenty five ponds, brown eyes, her breast were not to large or to big just perfect but what he looked for in his victims was the size of their buttocks, he liked them plump. He left the house with his rape kit which held fake police badge chloroform, rope, and duck tape for their mouths, a brown wig and fake beard in a bowling bag he kept in the trunk of his car. He parked in her guest parking spot next to her car. He got out of his car acting normal, opened his trunk and poured the chloroform on a cloth where he proceeded to her apartment ringing her bell. He could hear her hurrying to the door.  "Yes, who is it?" she asked sounding groggy from just being awakened.  "Detective Branigen, Ms. Holt." He told her.  "Where is your uniform?" she asked peeking out the peep hole.  "I am a detective we don't wear uniforms." He told her holding up his fake badge.  "What is wrong?" she asked him as she unlocked the security locks opening the door to him. "Has something happened to one of my family members?" she asked with a worried expression on her face as she allowed him to come inside shutting the door behind them.  Tom turned towards her seeing that she had nothing on under her robe as it was slightly opened. "No nothing like that, I am here to rape you!" he told her grabbing her as he placed the cloth over her face until she succumbed to the chloroform.  "I am so sorry to be so late sweet heart." He told the unconscious woman that he held against his body locking the door behind. "I see you've been waiting for me." He told her smiling when her robe fell open exposing her naked body. He carried her to her bedroom laying her on the bed removing her robe. Removing his clothes he laid next to her touching her body, he began kissing her. "I know how much fore play is important to you my love." He told her as he placed his finger in her vagina. "You like that? Look at your body moving so wildly." He told Sally whose body was lying very still. "It's time to get ready for the rape scene baby." He told her kissing her then applying tape over her mouth, turning her over on her stomach tying her arms and legs to each of the legs on the bed.  She began to move, waking from the drug, feeling panic running through her body realizing she was tied up, she felt him massage her from the back. Tears coming to her eyes as she tried to scream but couldn't.  "Now? Ok Sally, you know I love pleasing you right Sally?" He asked her as her eyes showed the terror flowing through her body. No one could hear her muffled screams.  "Harder bitch? You want it harder?!" he asked becoming brutal grabbing her hair and lifting her head up. "like it Sally? I think I might have another date with you! You fucking whore!" he yelled in her ear as he had his orgasm. He used the chloroform on her again, untied the rope, removing the duct tape then rolled her over on her back caressing her breast kissing her good bye. He left behind a single red rose between her breasts.  Xavier's lover Tim stopped having sex with her at six months of her pregnancy. She ran an ad on the internet looking for men who found pregnant women sexy. The replies were astounding, the first one she met at a motel was a married fifty five year old black man and they had sex for hours. People who knew her saw her going into the motel's with these men. Thinking to them selves poor, poor Tom. Poor, poor Tom was sitting in the bar that night when a woman with shoulder length brown hair, green eyes, wearing a very provocative black dress showing her full bosoms sat next to him, she was drunk and looking for sex. She began to rub his penis smiling at him. He became aroused. "Come on with me if your want what I have in my pants. Because I want that ass you got." he told taking her out to his car where he drove to the woods so no one would see them or hear her scream.  "Take your clothes off." He told her breathing heavy getting out of his pants. He got out of the car pulling her out and pushing her in the back seat on her stomach she couldn't get up, he was already on top of her raping her with brute force as she screamed, screams no one could hear. He then killed her by strangling her to death with her dress, dumping her body out of his car leaving her there to be found by two hunters who just happened to stumble over her decomposed body that had been scattered by the wild animals six months later.  The ninth month.  Tom had managed not to be caught so far for the six rapes he had already committed and three murder's, he sat in the bar in a town fourteen miles away, he struck out with any of the women there so he left when he noticed a black prostitute standing on the corner with large breast and her buttocks was just perfect big and so round. She wore a short shiny silver dress that fit tight across her breast so it would not fall down with matching heels. He pulled the car up to the corner where she leaned in the window.  "What is your flavor tonight?" she asked smiling at him.  "Chocolate get in." he said getting aroused since this was the first time he had any kind of interracial sex. "two hundred dollars for everything ok?" he asked her.  "You got it baby." She told him taking his hand and placing it between her thighs. He was getting excited watching her have a climax. He pulled in to the woods. He was so excited he that he began masturbating watching her turning around in circles naked.  "Come here." He told her throwing her face down on the hood of the car raping and stabbing her repeatedly in the back. Throwing her on the ground she was barely alive when he raped her laying there on her back, and then in a split second slit her throat so she was dead and he had sex with her dead body for hours. Her body wasn't found for three years when a group of teenagers were out there camping when they saw the human skull.  That night when Tom got home from his killing of the black prostitute Xavier was in labor, she was in labor for six hours at the hospital when she gave birth to an eight pound baby boy. Each witch had theirs before the end of November.  December 24th all the house holds had their families over loving on the babies at three 'o clock in the afternoon they all took their babies to bathe them and instead drowned them all. Each woman walked out into the living where the families were gathered.  "I drowned the baby." They all said at the exact same time.  All the family members went running to the bathrooms finding the babies floating face down. When they returned to the women they did not remember being pregnant or anything about drowning the babies. Xavier left Toms wife frozen as she stepped out of her in front of him.  "You're so evil raping and killing those women, I'll fuck you when we meet in hell." She told him with a smile kissing him as she placed his hands on her ass thinking of his evil acts excited her. " Think I'll come back tonight." She told him pressing her body hard against his.  The next day the news hit all the papers that an evil phenomenon had occurred on Christmas Eve causing fifty women in fifty states to drown their new born infants. All fifty women were polygraph and they all past the test. They did not have one memory except for being in the churches bathroom almost a year ago. They were tested by experts and they all were telling the truth. They were sentenced to fifteen year's imprisonment and lost any parental rights to any child for the rest of their lives.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © The women who were raped by Tom noticed the resemblance except for the hair and beard; he was pulled into the station where they put him in a line up wearing a fake beard and wig. The women picked Tom out of the line up. There was not one woman with any doubt. He received the death sentence at his trial.  Lillian an evil beautiful lust filled witch wasn't at church long when she spotted a young virgin of twenty two year old named Marla who was taking care of a fifty year old black woman named Thelma who had been comatose for five years with no chance of returning back to the wife that her fifty five year old husband stood by her faithfully. She decided that would be a great scandal and entered the virgin's body.  "You won't be a virgin much longer. "She told herself looking at the mousy clothes the girl wore. That was something she would change getting back to the house having his baby and killing it. "Old man I am going to make your small head grow big!" she said to her self.  What turned her on was the girl a virgin and the husband had abstained from sex for five years. She would destroy all that purity.  After church she changed in to a work out suit of a white sports bra that showed her nipples and white tight athletic shorts that revealed she wore a thong and everything else. Mike sat in his recliner wearing a white T shirt and black jeans, his hair was graying, he was heavy built. Mike tried watching television and Marla began to pick up the living room bending over in front of him with her legs spread slightly. He tried looking away only his eyes kept drifting back to her body; he felt an erection and he began to rub it through his pants wanting her so badly. She tripped falling backwards on to his lap. She could feel his erection against her. When he tried he tried to help her up his hands some how ended up on both of her breast. He couldn't fight it any longer, the desire for her raged through his body like an inferno. He kissed the side of her neck while softly caressing her breast; she did not resist his advances.  "Can we go to your bedroom?" he asked slipping his into the front of her shorts & thong feeling her moistness as her hips moved up and down as he touched her.  "Oh yes, yes." Lillian answered him trying to remember she was a virgin.  As they stood in her bedroom undressing Lillian was pleased with his packaging. Smiling she thought to her self oh that is not a beetle bug, but an eighteen wheeler and I am going to drive it so hard. He laid her on the bed placing his body over hers as he entered her slowly kissing her. Lillian felt the pain of Marla losing her virginity. They made love to each other for hours as he gave her orgasm after orgasm. As many men that Lillian had seduced, she never had one who could make love like he could. Or make her experience oral sex like he did. Well at least he thought it was her first time. She would enjoy sex with him; maybe she would keep him around for her after this was all over.  That night he lay in his bed across the room from his wife. Lillian came into the room wearing a white very thin night gown to give his wife Thelma her medication. Lillian used this as an excuse because the thought of having him while his wife laid there unable to do anything turned her on. Lillian walked to his bed looking in the mirror pulling back his covers she noticed his wife's eyes were watching them in the mirror this excited Lillian even more, she smiled at the woman as she removed her gown watching her husband take her into his arms ravishing her body with kisses and entering her body, and forced to hear their moans from the passion's they were feeling.  She heard her husband tell the woman she thought was Marla he wanted to make her his wife; she has given him the knowledge of what love was. He wanted a child with her; something his wife always denied him to hurt him. And you won't have your little whore either. The woman thought to herself she had been faking her illness.  "I love you and want to marry you." she told him as he made love to her. "Let's start making our baby now." She told him smiling since this was May and the child had to be born before Easter for that was the day she and the other forty nine witches would slaughter their babies.  The other witches in her group were happily seducing the husbands just as the husbands loved being seduced by their wives. And soon their friends and family members would be included in the seductions.  The next morning when Mike woke up he saw his wife sitting on the edge of her bed." Thelma? Thelma you're alright?" he asked feeling his world crashing around him.  "Yes and that means your little whore will be leaving today." She told him smiling." And that means there will be no little bastard child either." she told him laughing.  While she enjoyed telling Marla she was leaving today and would never have her husband ever again. Mike came back into the room, "Joe will be here shortly to take you to his place." He told her sadly.  His wife shot him a hateful look. "Your brothers? How convenient!" she yelled." No, I won't stand for it!" she yelled.  "You don't have any say in it!" he yelled back at his wife taking Marla in his arms kissing her passionately running his hands over her tender young body. This was turning Lillian on.  Lillian wanted to come out so bad and blast her, but she had to remain sweet little Marla who would be fucking both brothers.  Joe looked a lot like Mike except he was sixty years old and he lived alone; Lillian wondered if he had equipment like Mike? Time to go exploring she thought to her self. That night as Joe was sitting on his couch in just a pair of boxer shorts. Lillian came out of her bed room wearing just a shirt that covered to her mid thigh.  "I am hot and can't sleep." She told him running her one hand up her thigh to her stomach showing her nude bottom half of her body. "you want me don't you?" she asked taking off her shirt walking up to him seeing his equipment was even better. She pulled his boxers off as he was speechless that this young woman wanted him.  "What about Mike?" he asked her becoming so aroused.  "If he really loved me he'd be here with me, not her. Now let's enjoy this time together." She told him kissing his ear lobes lowering her body over his she straddled him still sitting up, caressing her breast when he really began to get into it forgetting she could become pregnant until after he reached his climax." Do you have any kind of protection to use against getting pregnant?" he asked her.  "Don't worry about that." She told him getting aroused again and  They continued in his bedroom until he was tired out.  The next day when Joe went to work Mike showed up. "She refuses to let me go Marla, what are we going to do?" he asked her.  "Divorce her if you love me and give me the child you promised me we would have." She told him as she had tears in her eyes.  "I can't, you know our religion does not recognize it." He told her.  "We committed adultery and our religion does not recognize that either!" she told him becoming more upset forcing his hand at getting rid of his wife how ever he had to do it.  "Baby come here and let me love you." He told her trying to take her in his arms.  "No not until she is gone." She told him making him leave the home she now shared with his brother.  Once he had left she smiled knowing he was desperate to have this young body back. He would become insanely jealous when he sees her and Joe eating dinner at the same restaurant he and Thelma would be at tonight.  "Never mess with a naughty witch." She said out loud laughing. When Joe came in she was wearing a red seductive dress with long sleeves, cut low in the front showing just enough of her breast, a slit up one side to her mid thigh, red heels. Casting the spell on Joe to fall in love with her she was going to start a new family feud. Loving all the tension she was causing.  That night as they were dining Thelma saw Mike getting angry looking at Joe and Marla holding hands, watching Joe touching her thigh. He looked at Thelma knowing because of her he lost the woman who gave him the want to live." I hate you Thelma." He told her sipping his wine.  Thelma jumped up from the table walking briskly to Joe and Marla with her glass of wine throwing her wine in Lillian's face. Lillian became angered freezing everyone in motion except for Thelma, Lillian stepped out of Marla's body that was also frozen in place. Thelma had fear pulsating through her body as Lillian grabbed her by the throat.  " you miserable piece of a mortal! You lay in a bed for five years acting like your comatose, while you torment your husband constantly. I had plans for your death, but that has changed now You will give your husband the divorce and I have other great plans for you." she told the woman squeezing her neck watching her face turn red to purple." By the way people like you become the lowest life form of evil after death as a troll, for that is what you portrayed in your life!" she yelled at her knocking her to the ground.  Lillian reversed what had happened where Thelma came charging at the table tripping over her own feet hitting the ground as the glass intended for Marla landed directly on top of her head. Everyone laughed for they knew she had missed her intended victim.  That night after Lillian had pleasured herself with Joe, Xavier showed up after he was a sleep.  "Why are you doing this instead of the way it was planned?" she asked her witch.  "I am causing chaos, making the mother to be look like a tramp, she will be married by the time she gives birth, but I have chosen the evil ex wife to be the killer on Easter day. I will jump in her body at the time to make it happen, I have cast a spell when the old man and girl fall in love, and I will be having a sugar daddy watching while everything goes on." She told her  "That little bitch better be killed on Easter." Xavier warned her.  "It's a bastard not a bitch. "She told her. She conceived the first day." She told her as both witches smiled at each other.  Mike came over to see Marla. "I left her last night and got us an apartment so start packing. We will be married right after the divorce is final." He told her smiling taking her in his arms.  Lillian cast her spell of love on them, stepping out of her body and blending into the furniture. They were happy.  "Enjoy your happiness now my lovers for in a few months you will be in chaos once again." She said smiling as they had left to start their new life.  When Joe came home to find the long black haired beauty, with pale skin, black eyes, a body you only in see in a sex magazine. She was dressed in a skimpy black dress that hardly covered her large breast. She walked up to him placing his hands on her ass kissing him.  "Who are you?" he asked not trying to stop her.  "I am your new live in girl friend. "She said licking and sucking his finger. "We're going to have an orgy tonight with some friends of mine."  As they walked into the bedroom there were male and female demons, he tried to run, but she slammed the door sealing it so he could not escape not even by the windows. She sound proofed the walls. When she walked up to the largest demon, he was red with horns, a large head, touching him and she began kissing him all over his body then pleasured him while the male and female demons were sexually molesting Joe as he screamed.  "Feast my friends when you are done." She said smiling as the large demon took her throwing her on the ground.  "I am going to feast now." He said as he pleasured her." after they all had ate and not much was left of Joe.  She went to Thelma who was sleeping in her bed; Lillian threw back the covers stripping her of her night gown. Thelma looked scared at the woman.  "I am just going to teach you about sex before we share your body." She told Thelma kissing her lips as she lay next to her feeling her responding to the lust she had been denying that she was a lesbian, she began to become wild wanting the strange woman in bed with her. She pretended to be comatose so she could have Marla touch her in places then finishing her lust when the girl had left the room. Lillian gave her the sex she had been longing for.  After their session of sex Lillian took over her body joining in on orgies, picking up women in bars, people were talking about the change in her. All the other witches were Pregnant and Lillian was causing as much chaos as she could. Stalking Marla when she was six months pregnant calling her a whore, and home wrecker.  The months were going by fast and before long all the babies were born. Marla and Mike loved their precious son Mathew Joseph.  Easter morning had arrived, Marla and Mike slept soundly until they heard Mathew screaming out in severe pain. Running to his room they found Thelma stabbing the baby over and over they heard his last scream when they knocked Thelma down to the floor.  Marla picked her murdered son up in her arms crying out and the heavens heard her.  "No dear God! Please don't punish our baby boy for our sins!" she cried holding him tight against her body as his lifeless body spewed his blood all over Marla. "Why? Oh God why?" she cried out as she kissed and held Mathew praying for a miracle.  A bright light appeared in the room. Lillian tried to make her escape but Mystical Lightening and Mystic shadow blew her up.  Mystic shadow, Mystic caster and Flame Caster stood before the infant as mystic lightening shed her tears on him." Holding the child, she saw all the other murdered infants. "I mystical lightening grand daughter of Mystic Shadow sprinkle my tears on all the innocent infants caught in the Dark sides evil deeds,  Mystic shadow looked down at Thelma; she knew she made the deal for her soul to the Dark side. "You sold your soul to kill this child who has never caused you any harm. So I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light grant your wish to continue your contract with Hell in its fiery lakes is where you and all evil involved in this crime against the innocent are sentenced to for eternity to dwell." She chanted blowing the woman up along with all the other witches involved in the Easter day slaughter.  Mathew began to cry Mystical Lightening smiled as her tears sprinkled on him." The Higher Power does not punish the innocent only evil does." They vanished hearing the infants that were saved crying as they soared around the USA through the air before returning home.  The Dark Side had more evil to dish out on the mortals before their battle with the White Light Warriors in a little over two years. They would cause disasters after disasters to weaken the faith in their God and the goodness of mankind would no longer exist. They would start their own churches, with their own followers.  The New Age Church opened its door's on a bright sunny Sunday morning like every other church people came in mostly out of curiosity. There weren't any crosses or anything of Christianity what so ever. Each person was given a drink before each service called the blessing drink, anything that the Christian churches said was a sin they up held it . More and more people began to join. In six month's the church was becoming so large that the Priest Kevin Damien who was thirty seven years old, blond hair , blue eyes, tall , his charm was almost hypnotic to his listeners. Thought it would be a good cause to purchase land and all of their followers could live on the same land, living and loving together as the creator had planned before man began changing the rules. All the followers signed over their money, property and anything they owned now belonged to the church. They purchased fifty acres of land in Montana far into the wilderness. They built five hundred small houses and a large food hall where they would all cook and eat for the followers, a large house built similar to Grace Land for Kevin whom they all loved and believed in as if he was their God. The Church he had designed was in black with gold trim, inside the walls were even black , the pews were gold, the alter, and light fixtures were gold with specially made bulbs that looked like flames, lights were installed to shine down from the ceiling. At the services he dressed in long black robes with gold trim. His followers never questioned Kevin, they felt he knew what was best for them. The only ones who made trips into town were his trusties who started the church with him. They lived in the mansion with him, certain ones had certain duties to do as head of security, book keeping, and they all shared in on the private bible studies performed in the privacy of the mansion that happened to be their bedrooms. Each one having their own age groups and gender of sex of that they taught, Kevin's was from the age of twelve to twenty five all females Kevin made the bible studies to four times a week, three times a day morning , noon and night Kevin had twenty five of his own. Kevin and his trusties equaled thirty one, fifteen women and sixteen men. They all enjoyed the riches, drove nice trucks and cars to run their errands. Their followers were not allowed to have televisions or radios or read the news papers. The only thing they were allowed to read were the news letter he wrote of the messages that the great powerful one sent to him. Any mail sent to the post office box from other family members were destroyed and answered by one of the trusties as if they were the follower who it was written to. Kevin and his trusties ate only the best of foods prepared by their followers believing that they deserved these foods for they had reached a certain rank and one day the followers would be at that rank when they would expand with more followers. Then they would become a trustee to teach the great powerful ones word and their techniques that they use. Their followers blessing drink increased from once a week at church to once daily when they moved to the land to three times a day.  Kevin's first bible study was twenty five year old Belinda Carson who had been married for two years. She was tall and thin with dirty blond hair; she wore the same long brown short sleeve dress that the other women did. She sat at the table in Kevin's bed room. He began to massage her shoulders.  "You feel so tense, I know I am." He told her still massaging her shoulders. Suddenly he began to talk to someone in a language that she could not understand. He told her it was tongues and the powerful one wishes us to mate. He helped her from her chair.  "But I am married, wouldn't it be a sin?" she asked him.  Again he began to talk in a strange language. "He told me to tell you that you are married only to one and that is to me, now as we are all married to each other it is his wish. We are to love one another as man and wife. Who are we to question him after all he has given us?" he asked her holding her chin in his hand. " now remove your clothing and get into our bed of love." He told her pointing at the bed.  Tears were filling her eyes as she had never been with any other man except for her husband Michael. She stood before Kevin both of them naked as he touched her breast. She closed her eyes. He grabbed her into his arms kissing her passionately, falling back onto the bed kissing her lips, every inch of her body feeling her become aroused, and her body beginning to move to his touches. He entered her hearing her moan.  "Who are you married to?" he asked her making love to her.  "To you Kevin." She told him loving the way he made her feel. "Oh yes to you Kevin." She said as he made her feel passions that her husband never made her feel in their entire relationship.  Kevin removed her wedding ring from Michael placing a gold band on her finger. "We just consummated our marriage; you will only sleep with Michael when I tell you to." He told her going into her deeper and harder." Tell me do you love me?" he asked as was getting ready to explode into an orgasm.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © "I love you Kevin, I love you my husband!" she cried out as he gave her the most powerful orgasm.  At the same moment that they sealed their marriage Michael and Tamara consummated theirs placing the identical bands on as Kevin and Belinda. Tamara a tall thin black woman with short hair told Michael the exact same thing. Michael a twenty five year old Italian male who was five feet eight inches tall, stocky build. As he walked out of her bed room Belinda walked out of Kevin's they walked side by side not saying a word to their house. James a pedophile was in his room with eight year old Billy when he began to talk in a strange language. He looked over at the child the powerful one said you must show that you can obey and you must love me by showing me happiness or he will kill you and your family. "He told the child unzipping his pants and performed sexual acts on the fearful child.  That same day he raped a total of three young boys, one he sodomized, the other two he were made to perform oral on him. That morning thirty one women, men and children were molested believing it was meant to be happening. Fifteen husbands and wives were told not to have marital sex with each other that they now belonged to the trustee they had bible study with.  That afternoon thirteen year old Peggy Sue was sent to Kevin to be his next study where he convinced her that the powerful one ordered him to take her as his wife, placing a band on her finger he then consummated their marriage not paying any attention to her cries from the pain. The women who had young boys placed the bands on their finger too, then consummating their marriages.  That night another bible study group of thirty one followers came into each of the trustee's bedrooms they were to study with. A beautiful young girl named Mya of fifteen with long wavy black hair, blue eyes, and the body that any evil witch of beauty and seduction would be envious of. Talking in the strange language Kevin dropped to his knees in front of the girl grabbing both of her hands smiling up into her eyes. "You are to be my queen. Tonight we must wed in the church." He told her. He summons his entire trustees to get her ready to become his queen tonight. That night in the church she wore a black wedding dress with only his trustees & their bible study students were present. The UN holy union was performed by Kevin's second in command. He sliced their hands mixing their blood together, slipping a black & gold band on her finger that began to glow as did her eyes from the mixing of the blood she had become one with the dark side and Kevin. They were married for eternity she let her wedding gown fall to the floor as he undressed and began consummating their marriage on at the alter while the trustees took their bible study child or adult and had sex with them. She was moved into the house with Kevin, he had Trent his second in command to take her to town and dress her as his queen should be dressed. Trent a very large masculine bald man came from an interracial couple, his mother a witch met his father on a plantation where he was a slave giving his soul to the dark side to be freed as a slave to be with his lover Helena the witch of lust. Trent had magical powers, his light green eyes would glow a bright yellow when using the powers of destruction. Trent also wanted the new Queen Mya and this was his perfect opportunity to have her then he would replace Kevin as her husband and the new leader of the Occult.  As they rode down the road in the gold Mercedes he placed his hand on her pulling her brown dress up. Mya spread her legs letting him feel her moistness and letting him know she wanted him just as badly as he wanted her. Smiling he drove to a near by motel, Once inside the room Trent pulled her body against his, kissing her passionately on her lips, neck, caressing her breast, he gently lifted her dress over her head , removing her bra and panties, picking her up in his arms as he gently laid her on the bed kissing her softly on her lips. She watched him removing his clothing from his massive body seeing he was very much aroused by her, he joined her in the bed taking her into his arms kissing her feeling the passion rushing through their bodies as they hadn't as of yet to say a word to one another from the time they left the house. She loved the way he made her body feel the sensual sensations with his kisses softly all over her body, he entered her slowly as their eyes never left contact with one another, moving their bodies in a slow rhythm together until their passions exploded into the most powerful explosion as his seed was planted into her belly.  She lay in his arms feeling safe." I love you Trent, I don't even like Kevin making love to me." She told him feeling him tightening his arms around her.  "I promise you that you and I will be wed, I love you and have never loved before. Now I know how my father felt towards my mother."  He told her kissing her fore head." Be patient I have a plan." He told her.  Kevin had lost track of time because he was to wrapped up in the beautiful red headed Nicole, who was very busty, forcing her to give him oral sex over and over when he grabbed her making her sit on top of him moving her hips down on him harder, going into her so deep it was painful. He was becoming frustrated biting into her breast causing her to cry out in pain as tears ran down her face he slapped her so hard she fell to the floor, she could feel him on top of her back and then the excruciating pain as he brutally sodomized the young girl of eighteen, biting her back causing her even more pain. Nicole's screams could be heard by all of the followers and the trustees who smiled knowing he was having sadistic sex with her. When Kevin had finished he picked Nicole up with a brutal force throwing her on the bed as he grabbed her hand placing the gold band on her finger. "You are my wife now to obey me always." He told her then performed oral sex on her so her experience wouldn't be to bad for her, causing himself to become aroused again he entered her as they had an orgasm together .  Trent picked out the dresses he wanted his Queen to wear long black gowns cut low in the front exposing most of her breast, with long sleeves, some were sleeveless and backless, all outlined her body, he bought red ones. They all were trimmed in gold, he bought thongs and buster's, spiked heels, accessories for her hair, jewelry diamonds and rubies. He bought her from his own money a ruby, diamond clustered ring. Trent took her hand slipping it on her finger. "This represents my love to you." He told her kissing her hand as the female sales clerk smiled at the young couple who were in love. He picked the long black dress with long sleeves to wear home. As they drove home they held hands and he envisioned Kevin raping and beating her. He would end up killing their unborn child she carried which was his. He gently touched her stomach knowing today they made their son. She looked at him curiously wondering why he touched her stomach. Maybe he was thinking of the future.  "Our son is lying inside of his home right now." He told her smiling.  Mya smiled looking down at her stomach placing both hands on her stomach lovingly looking back at Trent tears forming in her eyes." our son, we're going to have a son." She said as she cried tears of joy. "What do I do to keep Kevin from me?" she asked the thought of another man touching her made her ill.  "Tonight he is going to introduce satanic sex orgies I will manage to be with you." He told her as he wanted no other man to touch her.  As he thought he knew he had to tell her everything. "Look my mother was a witch her name was Helena the witch of lust, but she was not evil she was good. My father knowing nothing about witch craft assumed they all were part of the evil. He sold his soul thinking they could be together and he'd be free as a slave. The dark side made a deal and he joined forces with them as a warrior and he would be with Helena forever. My father made the agreement and they brought him back as a powerful demon, they allowed him to marry her and they conceived me, at my birth they cut her throat as he watched them killing her he knew if he reacted they would kill me. They handed me to him; I was raised by witches as my mother's spirit visited me secretly at night making me promise to tell no one. My father just went insane after they killed her becoming their strongest most evil warrior until he met a witch by the name of Mystic shadow; he fell in love with her because she reminded him of his true love. That love bringing the good part out, but her rejection brought the evil insane one out; finally in the end her husband Knight Shadow put him to rest by destroying him forever instead of him being tormented any longer. His demons name was Gore warrior; his mortal name was Otis White that was the last name of the plantation owner who bought him as a slave." He said looking sad. "I made a promise and plan on carrying it out." He told her kissing her hand.  "Why don't I feel the evil flowing through me any more?" she asked remembering her eyes did not glow with him.  "Your true love for me killed the evil." He explained." Just stay quiet or we will both be killed." He told her with a serious look.  When they returned Kevin was waiting in the down stairs parlor. "Ah my Queen you are beautiful." He told her rising from the custom made plush black velvet chair taking her in his arms kissing her on her fore head. "We have to get ready for tonight, for tonight we introduce the drinking of blood and the sexual orgy, Trent you are to be with my beautiful Queen." He told him because he trusted him whole heartedly.  Nicole sat in her bedroom so her family would not hear her crying, but it was useless her mother & father came into the room. She told them the whole story of the bible study, showed them the bites on her body. They planned to escape feeling they had been caught up in a satanic cult. They heard the bell calling them all to the church UN aware they all had to perform in tonight's rituals. When gave the drink for blessing they had to swallow it or the others may get suspicious. Kevin told everyone that the small cups they were handed to drink that it was the blood of the all powerful one knowing it was the blood of a slaughtered pig. The followers obeyed and drank it as most of them gagged. They then were ordered to stand and remove their clothing for tonight they were to all become one as the trustees matched up couples, men with men , women with women, man with child, woman with child, husbands with other wives, and Kevin picked twelve year old Lilly. When most of the people refused to have sex with the children Kevin brought a six year old boy up holding the child in front of him.  "Because of your disobedience to the powerful one you have just sacrificed this child for him to forgive us!" he yelled as he slit the Childs throat letting his body drop to the floor.  The people screamed as the trustees held machine guns on them. Trent tried to keep Mya calm so Kevin would not find out she was no longer evil. Whispered in her ear." Act like it does not bother you, smile please baby." He told her as they sat behind Kevin.  Kevin looked at the people who were filled with fear. " finish the powerful ones ritual or that three year old girl will be shot dead." He ordered them.  The followers did as they were told, with the drug taking effect they almost removed their consciousness from their minds to continue on doing something that was not in their beliefs. Mya's tears fell onto Trent's chest as she heard the screams of the children and the men being sexually abused. He quickly cast a spell blocking it out so she would not have to endure it. She sat on top of him looking into his eyes while they made love she was UN aware of the horrible activity happening around her. Kevin attacked the little girl as viciously as he did Nicole earlier. After the orgy was over Kevin ordered that who ever was their partner here was the one they were to go home with and sleep with tonight. He had not finished with Lilly and did not want Mya in his way.  Trent knew now he would be able to take over without any problems and he would do it tomorrow. He sound proofed the house so the sounds of the screams could not be heard. He made love to Mya all night.  The next morning they heard the church bells ringing as they all gathered wondering what could have happened. Kevin stood at the altar with twenty bodies piled up on top of each other, Lilly lying on top.  "The powerful one took Lilly home last night, and the rest of these were people who tried to escape. Breaking the rules of leaving, they were shot down by our security in our towers. No one is leaving here." He smiled evilly at them. Trent's eyes began to glow as he walked into the church wearing black slacks and a skin tight black muscle shirt dressed as his father did in his life. He walked like a warrior down the middle of the church blowing up Kevin's trustees, machine guns flew threw the air and those who weren't with the white power. As Mya followed behind him she looked at everyone smiling at this massive hero. He pulled Kevin through the air with his powers.  "You sickening mortal, you would not know a demon or a warlock if one was your right hand man! I am half warlock, half demon and my name is Rage warrior the son of Gore warrior and Helena the witch of lust. You have done enough and now you are going to be fed to the one who eats evil souls." he told Kevin as he hung in the air crying for he really never believed in the demons and witches. He only used the Occult to get rich and use the people for their sick sexual lust. "Have a nice trip Kevin." He told him before blowing him up.  He turned to the people." you can stay or go, but live your lives in the manor of the White Light." He told them.  They all stayed with him. They made a grave yard burying the victims of Kevin.  Six months had gone by and everyone was happy, they all ate at the large kitchen and turned the house that Kevin lived in to a place where they all could play games and watch movies. They remodeled the other houses with television and radios. Rage warrior even lived in a smaller house with Mya who was growing huge with child.  Wynona, a twenty three year old pretty blond who was very built, she asked if she could speak with Rage warrior that she had a problem, it was not uncommon for the others to come to him with their problems. Once they went inside of her house and he sat on the couch and she straddled him as she kissed him placing his hands on her breast. Rage warrior jumped up from the couch knocking her on the floor.  "My love is for Mya. Don't ever forget it." He told her walking out.  He told Mya what happened and she kissed him." what do you expect when you are so handsome and built like a .... ...a.... take me, just thinking about it turned me on." She told him as they laughed kissing each other.  That night they slept soundly in each others arms dreaming of the day when their child will be born. They truly loved one another totally.  Wynona opened her door smiling." taking me up on my offer Mr. faithful?" she asked being taken into Rage warrior's arms.  He carried her to the bed where they UN dressed and he ravished her body as she straddled him riding him hard until they climaxed at the exact same moment. Rage warrior held onto Mya as they slept.  The next morning they got up to go have breakfast with the other people, Wynona was sitting at a table by her self smiling at Rage warrior thinking of the great sex they had last night, as Rage warrior and Mya ate breakfast at another table kissing and feeding each other. Mya excused her self to go to the ladies room. Wynona walked past him and leaned over to whisper in his ear. "The door will be unlocked if you want to come visiting tonight." She told him smiling walking away.  "Damn girl just doesn't get the message that I don't want her." He said aloud to him self shaking his head never looking up at her as he ate his eggs and sausage with biscuits.  After breakfast Mya called up car dealer ships to sell the expensive auto mobiles to get more less expensive vehicles for everyone to use.  Rage warrior with some of the other men were making a play ground with the children's help. They built swing sets, slides, two houses with out any rooms for the boy's club house and one for the girl's club house. A little blue eyed girl walked up to him with long blond curly hair, she was only five years old and she tugged on his shirt.  Rage warrior looked down at her smiling." and what do you wish of me little Miss.?" He asked patting her head.  "Just to tell you thank you for making those bad people go away and stop hurting us." She told him looking like a little angel.  Rage warrior with tears forming in his eyes picked the little girl up hugging her tightly. "I promise I will always do my best to protect you and everyone else here." He told her placing her on the ground watching her run off with the other children.  "Makes you feel good doesn't it?" a strange female voice asked him standing behind him  Turning around he could not believe his eyes standing in front of him was The High Priestess Mystic shadow smiling at him wearing tight black jeans, black boots, a black halter top that had three straps in the back, her hair was pulled up with a clip. He stood looking at her with his mouth open.  "Rage warrior close your mouth it's unbecoming of a warrior." She told him tapping him on the chin with her finger tips smiling.  "I am just so amazed that you have come here to see us." He told her realizing she was identical to his mother in every way as she stood with her hands on hips looking around the property. "You look exactly like my mother." He told her.  She smiled at him. "she is my aunt and sends her love to you, my father is Fire caster her brother your uncle, and they both are with the spirit warriors of the White Light. I am here because of what you did in saving so many innocent peoples lives; to let you know that the ones that were murdered all of the adults joined the forces of the spirit warriors." She was telling him when Wynona ran up placing her self in between her and Rage warrior interrupting what she was telling him.  "Who the hell are you and what do you want?" Wynona asked her in a rude tone.  Mystic shadow looked at her smiling." Are you the guard dog around here?" she asked her looking at the bleached blond with contempt.  "for your information we are very, very close friends if you know what I mean and I want to know who you are bitch?!" she yelled at Mystic shadow.  "You're crazy; we are not close in anything!" Rage warrior yelled at her.  Mystic shadow looked angrily at Wynona. "You called me a bitch? No little girl, its correctly pronounced witch, w-I-t-c-h! High Priestess to be exact! and you need an attitude adjustment which I am going to give you." She told her lifting her in the air spinning her around fast.  "Stop please stop." Wynona pleaded.  Mystic shadow placed her on the ground watching her trying to stand straight." See that tree over there?" Mystic shadow asked her.  "Yes why?" she asked feeling sick  Mystic shadow blew it up with her magic. "You ever disrespect me again and that tree will be you." She told her firmly.  Mya stood in the back ground smiling watching Wynona running away. She stood silently listening to Mystic shadow talking to Rage warrior.  "I want to tell you thank you for putting my father to rest." He told her sincerely.  "Your father and I had a love, hate relationship let's just say." She told him remembering the huge warrior of evil." any way I am here to help you. You need two schools for the smaller children and the older children." She told him clearing some property and placing two red school's side by side with grades one through sixth and the other one seven through twelfth, everyone looked at the mysterious woman helping them. "Two teachers." She said as two of her warriors appeared. "This is Sword Caster, and Light Shadow. Both are my warriors who will teach the children, they know how to contact me should the dark side give you any problems, your under our protection." She told him "one more thing, that hideous church." She said as she turned it into a white church with a cross that always glowed. She kissed him on his cheek and hugged Mya good bye and vanished into a sparkling mist.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © The warrior Sword caster was large like Rage warrior with long black hair, blue eyes and a beard, Light Shadow was a petite blond, and her body was very much toned. Rage warrior and Mya introduced them to everyone and the warriors began help fixing and building things with the others.  That night Rage warrior and Mya slept silently as Wynona was awaken by him standing naked over her bed smiling up at him.  "I thought we weren't close?" she asked looking into his glowing eyes.  "shut the fuck up bitch!" he told her sounding so demonic ripping her night gown off of her and taking her with such force that the rougher he was the more she got into it until they reached an explosive climax.  "Why don't you just move in with me?" she asked as he dressed  He turned to her his eyes still glowing. "You are just my whore, you would never be my queen!" he told her walking out on her as she was angered by his words. Once outside in front of the house he vanished unaware that Nicole had seen him.  Nicole thought it strange since she had never seen him use any of his powers since the day he saved them. She began to run to Mya's and Rage warrior's house looking in their bedroom window they were sound a sleep. Looking around with fear in her heart she ran home.  The next morning Rage warrior woke up feeling to weak to get out of bed. Mya went to get his breakfast and bring it back to him. Wynona saw her walking up to her, she was still mad at being called a whore.  "Where is Rage warrior?" she asked smiling.  "He isn't feeling well today so he is staying in bed." She told her.  "Wow I must have really gave him a good fuck last night." She told her patting Mya's belly.  "Your nuts! He was in bed with me all night!" she yelled as she pushed past her taking their food back to their house.  "I bet he fucks me tonight too!" she yelled as Mya was leaving.  Mya had to actually feed him he was so weak, then he fell back to sleep. She would know if he had left in the middle of the night she thought to herself.  That night Rage warrior was back at Wynona's as she performed oral sex on him, he pulled her up on top of him entering her, he caressed her breast, rolling her over on her back where he became almost vicious, he was actually hurting her as he went in deeper and harder until he exploded into an orgasm.  Mya had sat up all night taking care of Rage warrior who was growing weaker, this morning he would not even wake up. Mya ran to the door screaming for help, the people came running. The two warriors appeared in front of her. "What has happened?" they asked.  "He won't wake up!" she cried fearing she was losing him.  They pushed past her finding Rage warrior lay almost lifeless in the bed, they quickly summoned Mystic shadow.  Mystic shadow looked at Rage warrior knowing his life was being drained from his body. "When did he get like this?" she asked Mya.  "He has been in bed since the night before last.  "He was pretty alive in my bed last night." Wynona told them as she stood behind Mya.  Mya turned to Wynona with a look that could kill. "you just won't give up will you? I sat up all night with him! With a wash cloth on his fore head!" Mya told her breaking down crying.  "If it wasn't him then who was it?" she asked looking scared  "I saw someone the other night leave your house and vanish, I thought it was Rage warrior too but I looked in their bedroom window he was sleeping." Nicole told them softly.  Mystic shadow knew it was him killing him self. She summoned Guardian caster. "The demon is trying to kill him to take over thinking he will be in control. "She told her.  "He will be in control." She told her as she quickly made a potion to cure him when the evil Rage warrior appeared.  "It won't work he is going to die as you see I am here and strong while he lies there dying." He told them laughing.  "Wrong he is still breathing while you are out of his body." Mystic shadow told him.  Suddenly in a swift powerful move he grabbed her." I see now why my father loved fucking you." He told her holding her tightly against him as the potion was administered to Rage warrior, the evil one vanished with Mystic shadow before anyone knew what had happened.  He stood holding her body tightly against his, kissing her, she was helpless against him. "We're in my new dream world and I have powers see." He told her as he blew up a rock." And in my dream you want me, want to please me, love me." He said ordering his dream to begin.  They were in a large bed as he kissed her passionately; he turned more and more demonic, she knew it was that he wanted her to love him in his dream and she had to do something to break his concentration. She cried out for Knight Shadow before he had he could rape her. By breaking his concentration it allowed Knight Shadow in to the dream. "Hey asshole that is my wife!" He yelled getting the demon away from Mystic shadow.  "She is going to be my fuck for now." Rage Warrior yelled sending Knight Shadow across the room into the wall.  "Knight Shadow! "Mystic Shadow cried out watching her husband battle this huge demon.  Knight Shadow saw that his sleeve had ripped. "Now you went and did it!" he yelled blowing up Rage warrior  "What about the good Rage warrior?" she asked.  "He is worried about his beautiful cousin." He told her smiling." And no more demons ok?" he told her kissing her.  "You're so funny; ha ha ha , but keep your warrior job though." She told him as they vanished  That night as Wynona was sleeping two green scaly hands with long claws ripped her through the bed, she has never been found.  Rage warrior was completely well now and Mya delivered a healthy nine pound baby boy named Mystical warrior in honor of his cousin for saving his life. The fairies and all the warriors gathered to view the baby.  There were female warriors placed on the land to protect the child and mother against the Dark Side attacking them. Rage warrior knew just before the war was to break out he would have to move them and the other women with small children to safety with Mystic shadow. The people were making preparations for the day when good vs. evil making weapons that they could use, potions to use against the evil, crosses that were specially made by Guardian Caster they would project a shield around the wearer who was being attacked.  The world was showing signs of the approaching war, young children being taken and never found, children killing and raping other children, teenagers killing friends, teacher's family, and strangers just walking down the street. Drugs made by the Dark Side were moving through the world like wild fire. Men and women raped every thirty minutes of the day. The law enforcement was amongst those giving into the Dark Side killing good officers who would not agree with their tactics, raping the citizens they pulled over or the ones they had locked in their cells, brutally beating and raping of female officers, killing them so savagely and scattering their body parts all over so they could never be properly buried to rest in peace. There were acts of terrorism across the world killing innocent people, world leaders trying to win against the terrorist.  These were the signs that in the next year and a half the final war would take place here on earth between good and evil.  Linda Green a twenty six year old female had been with the police force for two years, she wore her blond hair short, her body was firm from working out, she was tall, her green eyes that showed the goodness in her soul. She wore her black uniform and Police badge with pride. Tonight she was working the grave yard shift when she got a call that an alarm was going off in some ware houses on the west side of town. Pulling in to the ware houses she had a funny feeling when she saw an opened bay, she radio in she was going to go check it out. She slowly got out of her patrol car with her flash light and gun in hand. She slowly walked up the bay shinning the light inside of the open bay, but she saw nothing, moving in slowly and carefully she moved to the center of the room looking around when a net fell on her knocking her to the ground due to the weights attached to it making it heavy and her gun slid across the floor. She struggled to get free when she saw four of her fellow male officers. They were all dressed in black shirts and black slacks.  "Ok you can let me up now, you've had your fun." She said getting on her hands and knees.  "Now that is the position I like seeing women in on their hands and knees." Lionel Washington said smiling a black male, six feet four inches tall, heavy set, a twenty year veteran with the police force he was just made sergeant.  The men grabbed her up off the ground carrying her still in the net taking her to a car they had in the back and putting her in the trunk. She tried struggling against them, but could not get free because of the net.  "Stop! This isn't funny any more!" she yelled at them looking at her brother's best friend Leon Jackson who had been on the police force for three years, a black male. He stood five feet eight inches tall, muscular build; he could not look her in the eyes.  "Well it's going to be real fun for us! Let's just say you're the guest of honor." Harvey Lugetti said laughing, he was Italian with a wife and six children, he'd been with the force for twenty years and a detective of homicide. He's heavy set, five feet eleven inches tall with black hair and mustache.  "Please why are you doing this to me?" she asked crying as the realization was they were serious in what ever they had planned for her.  "Lets just say I got tired of watching you tease me working out and turning me down like I wasn't good enough for you!" Danny Billings told her, a white male, blond hair, blue eyes, six feet two inches tall male, ten years with the force, her work out partner.  "It wasn't me; it was the policy of the police force." She told him crying as she tried to get out.  "Rules are made to be broken." Danny told her slamming the trunk shut.  To her it felt like they had been driving for hours when they finally came to a stop. They pulled her out of the trunk she could see they were at a cabin in the woods, they dragged her inside with the net still on her until they put her in a room that had chains hanging from the ceiling with hand cuffs attached to them against the wall, the bed had chains and shackles to hold a person there. She saw whips, chains and branding irons, a chain saw in the corner. As she looked at the floor she saw old blood stains.  "No! oh God no please!" she cried as she began struggling when Lionel Washington hit her so hard with his fist directly on her nose shattering it, the force was so hard it knocked her out.  Waking up she was nude tied to the bed with them all naked standing around her looking at her laughing." Ok Leon she is awake prove to us your one of us." Lionel told him shoving him in the bed with her.  Leon began raping her, blocking her screams and cries out of his mind; his eyes closed not wanting to see her bloody face from her broken nose. Once he was done he got off of her feeling sick, but not letting the others see it bothered him. Danny was next as he raped her, he would punch her in her face until her face was bloodied and swelling. The others were just as brutal with her hitting her so hard knocking her teeth out of her mouth, Harvey cut her nipples off as she screamed out a blood curdling scream. As the men pulled her up from the bed to chain her to the wall she looked them all directly in their eyes with the hate and contempt she felt for all of them.  "I promise you all this, I will return from death and kill every one of you! I beg of the power above to grant me this request." She said before her head slumped over as the Higher Power took her before they could enjoy anymore of their torture on her.  The men felt an eeriness by her words, instead of cutting her up they cleaned up the evidence that could link them to her murder, they washed her out so no traces of their sperm could be detected, wiping her body down so no finger prints could be picked up off of her skin, they knew how to clean up their tracks. They placed plastic in the trunk of the car, wrapping her up and dumped her not far from the ware houses knowing the other officers were looking for her as they listened to the police radio. They cleaned any trace of her hair on them or the car. They were silent as they rode back hearing her promise to them over and over, how she suddenly died as if some force had put her out of her suffering. When Lionel looked in the rear view mirror he saw her running naked and bloodied and battered down the high way after them. Lionel eyes got wide as he slammed on the brakes throwing everyone forward in the car.  "The fucking bitch is a live! Look she's coming down the road!" he yelled as he saw her coming faster and faster after them.  The others looked behind them; they only saw a dark lonely road. "Man your nuts there isn't anything there." Danny told him.  "Let's go man before one of the other officers spot us out here and start asking questions." Harvey told Lionel getting edgy by all of this weirdness.  That night they each dreamt of her calling them to her then she would be right in front of them all bloody, her nipples gone and dripping blood from the open holes, grabbing them and kissing them with her bloody toothless mouth, her face swollen and bruised almost unrecognizable as a human face.  The next day they heard her body had been found, they even requested to be the ones to find the perpetrators of their fallen sister. At her viewing her family requested an open casket so everyone would know what she had gone through, she had appeared in a dream to her mother asking her not to close the casket, she did not want her death to be in vain, she wanted everyone to know what they did to her.  Her family sat in the front pew of the funeral home listening to the gasp when friends and family saw her face, she was dressed in her police uniform, Leon walked slowly to the casket not wanting to see what he and the others had done. He looked down into the coffin only he saw her nude with out nipples as the blood gushing out of the holes; suddenly she jumped up at him grabbing him by the throat when he started screaming. Her brother Lewis ran up to him placing his arm around him to calm him down.  "Hey that's just a shell laying there she is up in heaven." He told him as he tried to comfort his friend.  Leon realizing she wasn't strangling him, she was in her uniform. Tears coming to his eyes." Oh man this is so wrong." He said under his breath, he then pushed Lewis away and ran as fast as he could to his apartment. The other three men thought she opened her eyes with that same look in her eyes before she died. Leon walked back and forth in his eighth floor apartment when he saw her nude and bloody.  "Want me now Leon?" she asked as she kept walking towards him.  "I swear I didn't want to do it! Linda I swear!" he kept telling her as she walked slowly towards him, he kept backing up towards the balcony.  "Bull shit you didn't want to do it! You sure as hell didn't try to save me either!" she yelled at him with a look of hate on her disfigured face that she would make sure he would remember it even in death.  She started running at him screaming that blood curdling scream she screamed that night, he turned running as he kept looking back at her she was getting closer, he had to get away from her when he crashed through the balcony railing falling to his death.  "I didn't mean that either." She said smiling down as the spirit warriors of the white light carried his screaming insane soul to hell.  That night as Harvey and his wife Wendy were having sex with her on top of him, she was a pretty petite blond, with breast implants, he opened his eyes seeing Linda was on him bloody and gory kissing him smearing her blood all over his face. His face bore the face of fear before death.  Wendy seeing her husbands face all distorted thought he was having a heart attack. "What's wrong Harvey? Don't you like the way I am doing it tonight?" he heard Linda ask him.  "Linda!" he screamed full of fear trying to get away from her kisses.  He began screaming throwing his wife to the floor knocking her out when Linda came climbing up on to the bed from the floor smiling at Harvey, he began screaming louder trying to get out of the bed when his heart exploded hearing Linda's laughter was the last thing he took with him to his death where he would hear it over and over as his soul was carried off to hell.  Linda looked back at the woman sadly who was still knocked out. "I did you a big favor, you just don't know." She said vanishing.  When Wendy came to she found him dead with the look of fear on his face as if it was the devil him self he had seen. The police and paramedics arrived with the chief of police Raymond Richardson trying to figure why did two of his officers die in the same day as if they were in fear of their lives? He was a tall, thin muscular build man in his early fifty's, he was bald on top with gray short hair in the back, grayish blue eyes, he was a fair good hearted man.  "I know this is a terrible time for you Wendy, but can you tell me what happened?" he asked her.  She began crying wiping her tears from her face with both hands.  "We were making love and all of a sudden he began acting like he was trying to get away from something. I remember now he called out Linda's name then threw me to the floor so hard I was knocked out. By the time I came to he was already dead with that horrible look on his face." She told him breaking down again." He was a good man! We were going to go on our second honey moon next week." she cried into her hands." Oh Harvey why did you have to leave me for?" she cried as they moved his body out on a stretcher.  The chief of police wondered to him self why both men were heard screaming out Linda's name at their death's. Leon's neighbors told them he was heard screaming the name Linda. Were they some how involved with her murder? He asked him self. He decided to remain quiet until he could get to the bottom of it.  The two remaining men who were still alive met at a near by park where both were visibly shaken up. Lionel's hand was shaking as he tried to drink his coffee. Wishing he could turn back the hands of time, that they had not picked her as the victim. Knowing he was going to die and was helpless to stop it from happening.  "Man she is keeping her word, she fucking told us she would come back from death to kill us." He said getting tears in his eyes, not that he was sorry for what he had done, but he was scared for him self.  Danny looked at the ground." The way she just died after she made that promise, it was as if something removed her so we couldn't finish cutting her up while she was still alive." Danny said as he thought of those powerful words that she spoke that he kept hearing some times so loud he could hardly bare it.  "Want some doughnuts boys with your coffee?" Linda asked standing behind the bench they were sitting on holding her nipples in her hands dripping blood from her face and where her nipples once were.  Both men jumped up and started running as fast as they could as the female officer Nancy watched them running from the two glazed doughnuts she held in her hands they acted as if they were scared of the doughnuts. Shrugging her shoulder's she sat on the bench. She finished drinking her coffee and eating the two doughnuts. The two men ran until they could not run any more.  "We need to get to work before we're missed." Danny told Lionel trying to pull him self together.  While Lionel sat at his desk he was beginning to feel better and decided he would go check out a murder scene of a prostitute, her body had been found in a saw mill severed into pieces and of course she was one of their victims as they scattered her remains all over town. The saw mill had been closed until they were through investigating the case which would go unsolved. As he walked through the mill he heard the saws start up. No one is suppose to be here damn it! He thought to him self as he went to check out the reason for the saws going. He looked around and saw no one there. Looking around he saw Linda standing behind him.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © "Please Linda, please I am sorry for what happened." He told her turning around trying to walk back wards to get away from her.  "Take your clothes off now or I will saw you in half!" she told him with that same look on her face as she did the night she made the promise.  He tried to run to escape her, but she appeared in front of him. "Ok, ok, I'll take them off." He told her as he removed his clothes standing in front of her nude.  A small saw blade flew through the air removing his penis. He began screaming as he looked at his penis on the floor, the blood was squirting out like an oil well had been struck with each one of his heart beats. He tried to stop the bleeding with his hands as she walked towards him.  "It was too small any ways to do any woman any good. A pickle would be better than that pitiful thing." She told him taunting him as he was growing weak from losing so much blood.  He kept walking backwards trying to get away from her as his heart pound faster and the blood squirted even faster when he fell back wards on to the large saw cutting him self in half. Her name appeared on the floor by his penis wrote in his blood. She wanted everyone to know they had been the ones who had raped, murdered and mutilated her body.  "Burn in hell with your other two buddies for Danny will be joining you three goons very soon." She told his corpse smiling.  Danny was true to his nature at the gym where most of the police officers used to work out, he was working out on the weight bench when she straddled him holding the three hundred fifty pounds weights across his throat watching his face turning purple as she smiled down at him.  "Linda, stop please! I am sorry!" he was able to yell out.  Everyone looked at Danny forcing the weights down on his own throat like he was begging someone to stop, but he was the only person there.  One of the other guys working out ran over pulling the weights off of him. "Man you on drugs or something?" he asked Danny.  Danny looking petrified at the man, "Linda is trying to kill me for what we did to her that night!" he told the guy looking around the room scared to death, then he looked like he saw Linda who was not there." I am sorry we killed you, I am sorry we raped you! Is that what you want to hear an apology? I am fucking sorry!" he cried out as everyone looked at him hearing the confession that he took part in Linda's murder.  Shaking her head no, she walked towards him with the same look just before she died. "Don't you want my rotting flesh now to fuck?" she asked pulling off the remaining part of her right breast throwing at him.  "No, no!" he yelled terrified running out of the gym looking back and seeing her chasing him, his heart was pounding in his ears, he had a wild gaze about him, he was so petrified he ran into the path of a eighteen wheeler killing him instantly, the rig was properly named HELL BOUND!  She smiled watching the spirit warriors take him away knowing that everyone now knew the truth that they were her murderers. She knew there were more Police officers just as corrupt and evil as they were. She turned into a gold glittering mist flying towards heaven. The Chief of Police closed the case of Linda Green. He hung a plaque in her honor hanging with the other fallen officers; even in death you caught your criminals. He thought to him self as he looked at her picture that reminded him of an angel.  The next day when he past her plaque someone had stuck a close up shot of a picture of her from the crime scene. "My God when is it going to end?" he asked aloud.  One of his officers walked past him. "You honor that bitch dishonoring men who were here for twenty years!" Juan Garcia said to him looking at him with hate., he was a young Hispanic officer in his early thirties, tall and slim build.  "And since when is it company policy to honor murderers and rapist?" The chief of police asked him.  Juan looked at him dumb founded with out an answer to his question as every one looked at the two men. The chief took her crime scene picture off her plaque.  "If you do not like the policy here to "Serve "and to "Protect" then perhaps you should turn your gun and shield in right now, and that goes for anyone else who doesn't like the way Linda Green was honored and remembered here." He said as he looked in to each one of his officer's eyes.  He went to his office remembering when officers were on the good side. Remembering a sign, he had seen in one of the Broward county crime commission offices. "Evil Triumphs When Good People Stand Idly By." He said aloud to him self  A new female officer Casey Blackstone had been hired two week's after Linda's murder. Casey a thirty six years old, half her of adult life was in law enforcement. Since she was eighteen years old , her hair was so black it cast a blue haze, she was five feet eight inches tall, her weight was one hundred forty pounds, brown eyes, she was a 6th degree in marital arts, she had been trained to serve in the special tactical unit for six years. The chief of police had requested for her to be transferred to his unit. Her files had been touched up so that no one would know what she really was and why she was here. The chief felt there were a lot more evil cops then good.  As the chief showed her around the other officers watched her, the male officers who were corrupt smiled as they thought to them self's rookie and would put her through the mill.  Casey Blackstone's first day on the job, as she was walking down the hall she passed a group of male officers as they were making comments about who would be the first one to fuck her. Casey turned around smiling at them. "Aren't you officers of the law and not high school thugs?" She asked them smiling sarcastically at the men.  The female officers stood still holding their breaths, they feared these men. Mitch Danielson enraged by her disrespect to them walked up to her quickly grabbing her by the back of the hair to slam her face first into the wall when she reversed it on him, he ate the wall and then she sent him to the floor with her black police issued shoe on his throat.  Her teeth clenched looking down at him." Touch me again; I will not hesitate to snap your fucking neck! Is that under stood Officer Danielson?" she asked him, as his face was turning red.  The other five men decided to help him by charging at her when they found them selves flying through the air, crashing into walls and Dave Smith hitting the chief's door.  "what is going on out here?" he asked them seeing six of his male officers on the floor, the female officers smiling, Casey standing with her hands on her hips.  "Nothing sir they were welcoming me to the department I guess you could say." She told him with an ear to ear grin.  He smiled at her knowing he had made the right choice." Ok well since everything is under control I'll go back to my paper work." He told her closing the door.  She looked at the men on the floor smiling." Anytime you boys want a rematch let me know." She told them smiling  Dave Smith looked at the other female officers smiling at them for once a woman put them in their place." What the fuck are you bitches looking at?" he asked angrily.  Casey turned back to him hearing what he told the women. "Officer Smith those women are law enforcement officers just as you, treat them as equals and I will treat you as my equal." She told him looking him dead in the eyes as her eyes looked almost coal black at that moment. The other men saw her eyes as well and felt the cold blast of fear run through their veins. Watching her walk away with an air about her they could not explain.  Casey was on patrol as she drove through the warehouse's where they had grabbed Linda that night, she stopped directly in front of the bay door that had been opened that night, she looked at the door her eyes turning black realizing she was being fired upon. Dropping into the front seat she radio dispatch." Officer under fire." She said.  "Are you really Casey?" she heard the voice of Mitch Danielson returning her dispatch. "Wonder who is firing on a nice officer like you?" he asked taunting her.  "Hey Mitch, I hope your there when I come back in to the station." She told him as the shots were getting closer to the car; she lay on the floor board. "enjoyed the convo asshole, but I have to go." She told him grabbing her gun.  The five officers walked up to the car shooting at it with their riffles. When they looked in the car windows she literally blew Ron Traylor's face off. When the other men saw him go down they got even more angered as they started shooting inside of the car.  "Hey moron's behind you!" She said now wearing a black T shirt that had the words "HIGHER POWER" in white letters, black combat fatigues, black army boots, and their rifles went flying through the air.  They looked frightened at her. She walked slowly towards them.  "What the fuck are you?" Dave smith asked as they began to walk back wards.  "I am Linda Green, I am Maria Lopez, I am Frank smith, I am Paul Edgar's, "she told them as she transformed into each victim freezing them so they could not move as they tried to run, the men were scared of this woman or thing.  "Those are only a handful of victims your evil club has claimed in death or rape. I am a special tactical unit warrior of the Higher Power sent here to send your evil souls where they belong and one guess, its not earth, ok one more it has four letters starts with H ends in L. "She told them smiling.  "There's too many of us for you to stop every one of us, we are all over the country." Dave told her smiling.  "I have fourteen months left to do my job before the end." She told them then without warning blew them all up in a blaze as the spirit warriors took their screaming struggling souls to hell. She left the car sitting in the drive way.  She appeared behind Mitch who was trying to sexually assault a young female officer in the men's bath room. She grabbed him by the back of his shirt throwing him against the wall so hard it made a loud thud sound. The female officer stood in the corner with her shirt and bra ripped open crying, she was thankful that Casey came in when she did. He charged at Casey looking like a crazed animal when she froze him too.  "What the fuck?" he asked as he could not move looking at the woman in black combat wear.  "What's the matter don't like feeling helpless? I am sure Linda Green, Sarah Thomas, Lindell Jameson, Fanny Carson, Mike Danielson your brother, didn't like it either." She told him transforming into each person as she named off more names of victims with Linda's first.  He looked at her scared knowing she was not human, the other woman stood with tears in her eyes for she knew she had to be some sort of angel sent here to save them." thank you God." She said with her hands folded crying and looking up.  "I am in the special tactical unit of the Higher Power and you are joining your evil buddies in hell." She told him blowing him up. She smiled at the woman." He told me to tell you, you are welcome." She told her and turned going out the door.  She summoned every evil officer in this town and state to appear before her as she stood in the parking lot of the police station. Over one hundred officers appeared not one of them could move as she named over a hundred names including small children that were their victims as well. The good officers stood watching as the evil ones were screaming. They watched her transform into the victims.  "I am in the special tactical unit of the Higher Power and you all are invited to join your evil buddies in hell." She told them smiling as they blew up.  All the Officers stood smiling at their heroin sent to them from heaven. Casey walked up to Chief Richardson hugging him and kissing him softly on his cheek." I was told to answer the question you asked the Higher Power before my arrival here, he said it has ended now." She smiled as his eyes were tearing up as he remembered standing at Linda's Plaque taking the crime scene picture down.  Casey turned to the rest of the officers. "Remember we are here to "Serve" and to "Protect" but you need to ask for our help before it's gone too far." She told them smiling as she vanished into a gold sparkling fog.  Casey went from state to state revenging the crimes against law enforcement officers and citizens committed by the corrupted officers. In less then six months she had achieved her fight. Eight months were left before the war was to break out.  Mystic shadow, Knight Shadow and their warrior's trained every day, the twins training even harder to build their powers to magnitudes so the Dark Side would not stand a chance. The officers who gave their lives on earth were made warriors for the spiritual warriors.  Crimes on earth were now growing in forms of terrorist acts using biological war fare, the teenagers of the USA had grown more violent and protected from punishment of their parents by an agency arresting the parent and removing the child into worse situations then the supposed abuse and ignoring the true cases. This is what evil wanted, to turn everyone evil.  Leanne Wilson a ten year old white female decided she did not want to live by her parents Foster and Sara Wilson's rules set up at home, being in the house by six in the evening, having to do home work or chores, much less having to go to school at all. She wanted to hang out with the kids in her neighborhood wearing clothes that a prostitute would wear after she left her home in her normal clothes. She began drinking alcohol, smoking, doing drugs, having sex with a fifteen year old boy. One night she didn't come home at all staying at the boy's house, her parents frantic that some sex crazed maniac had taken their little girl. They searched, the police searched for her, but no one could find her. Leanne came home the next morning still high on cocaine, hickies all over her body. Her parents grounded her to her room for one month only to come out to eat, go to the bathroom and to go to school where the school would inform them when she was not there. Leanne became enraged with her parents taking an electrical iron and burning her own upper left arm and called the police to report her parents were abusing her; she was removed from the home even though this happened when both parents were at work, they still removed her putting her in a foster home ran by Charles and Wilma Seedily with six other foster children. The man and wife let the kids do as they please, they only cared about the three hundred dollars a month the state paid them for taking the children in their three bedroom home where four girls shared one room that had two sets of bunk beds with two dressers to share . The two boys shared the other room, but always seemed to sneak two girls in their room at night having sex. Their ages were two fourteen year old males; the girls were thirteen, twelve and two ten year olds.  After a month in the foster home the husband began abusing the children, the older ones escaped by sneaking out the window. The only ones left were Leanne and Missy who were both ten years old and beaten if they told anyone what really happened. When his wife was gone or sleeping he would then take the two girls making them join him at one time. He was high one night on cocaine; the foster parents were never drug tested through the agency. He raped Leanne by sodomizing her and she died by being ripped apart and bled to death in her bed. They told the police she must have slipped someone in during the night, she was a wild child and hard to handle. Nothing was done to him.  Timothy Kenshaw a senior in high school, tall, blond hair, blue eyes, he had the looks and charm of a male model, he was a well liked and a popular student at school. He began to become moody and violent towards everyone, he lived with his mother, a fifty year old invalid in a wheel chair, he was a loving son helping her reach things that she could not since the horrible accident that caused her paralyses and the death of his father who was driving home drunk from a family gathering. Timothy came out of it with a few bumps and bruises. This particular evening was different though when she asked him if he would get her a can of green beans down for her just as she had done a number of other times in the past.  He turned around so full of rage." I can't stand you old woman!" he yelled grabbing the green beans out of the cupboard.  She looked at him startled by his reaction towards her when he began bashing her in the head with the can over and over." Here's your fucking can of green beans mother!" he yelled finally stopping when there wasn't any more life left in her body. Turning around wiping the can off calmly sitting it down on the counter top he went up stairs removing his clothes and placing them in the metal container he used to store old clothes in. he carried the container to his car parked in the garage placing the container in the trunk, he called his aunt playing a recording of his mother in the back ground asking him if he would help her move her wheel chair into the family room so she could watch television while he was out.  "Just a moment please Aunt Sharon." He said into the receiver. "Just a moment mother I am speaking with Aunt Sharon." He said as if he was talking to her. "Mother sends her love, I will be there in about an hour and please don't worry I don't mind helping you moving the couch." He told her smiling since his aunt lived in the next town that was a good hour's drive.  As he left the house he honked the horn as he always did saying good bye to his mother. He drove until he came to an abandoned house that sat way back in the woods and only fifteen minutes from his Aunts setting the container on fire and the house as if bums were staying in it trying to stay warm. He quickly left the house so he would not smell of smoke. He stayed at his aunts for an hour talking and laughing, he called the house but there wasn't any answer.  "She isn't answering, I better go maybe she has fallen and can't get to the phone." He told his aunt looking worried that his mother may be injured.  "Should I call the law to have them go by and check on her as well?" she asked him.  "Yes it will be at least an hour to get there from here." He told her kissing her good bye on her cheek, hurrying to his car worried that his poor mother had fallen.  "What a good boy he is." Sharon said who was twenty years older then her sister, white hair, slightly bent over wearing a light blue dress, a white belt, support stockings with beige shoes that laced.  When Timothy arrived at his and his mother's house there were police all around and the coroner's wagon. He jumped out of the car running to the house panic stricken." Mother! Mother! Mother!" he yelled as Officer Riley stopped him from going in the house.  "Tim wait, son she isn't with us anymore." He told him as Tim fell to the ground crying hysterically having losing both parents and both were horrible deaths.  "Oh God it's my entire fault! I should have stayed home with her, what happen? Did she fall out of her chair?" he asked Officer Riley with a tear soaked face full of pain and grief.  Officer Riley age fifty two, salt and pepper hair, heavy set, five feet eleven. Gray eyes. He had known the family all of his life, they played together as kids, went to school together and he was Tim's father's best man. He looked up at the sky as tears appeared in his eyes. Shaking his head he tried to control his voice from cracking.  "Timmy somebody killed her." he told the boy.  Tim looked shocked. Confused. "Killed her, why? Who? Who would kill her?" he asked looking at the officer." Where is she?" he asked crying.  "Inside Timmy, but let me warn you it is horrible." He told him as they walked into the house slowly.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © She was laid in a body bag on a stretcher, he walked up to it crying as he looked at the black bag. He reached for the zipper when Officer Riley grabbed his hand.  "Wait Timmy, her head was bashed in so bad that her brain is literally showing." He told him to prepare him for what he was going to see.  Timmy slowly opened up the bag screaming out in agony." Momma!" he cried falling over the bag holding it crying." why oh momma why?" he cried as the officers watched the poor boy crying over his mother.  Standing up trying to pull him self together." What did they use an ax?" he asked.  "No we found her still sitting in her chair in the kitchen where the perpetrators used a can of green beans." He told him feeling he had nothing to do with it.  "A can of green beans did that? When I left I put her in the living room she was going to watch television until I got back from Aunt Sharon's. If I had just stayed home she would be alive!" he told Officer Riley as he watched them remove her body from the house. Finally the bitch is gone. He thought to himself.  "Why don't you stay somewhere else tonight Timmy?" Officer Riley asked him.  "No I am going to stay here; she'd still be alive if I had stayed home to protect her." He told him  "It's not your fault, how would you know some maniac was going to break in here and do this? I just can't figure out why he or she would take her in the kitchen to kill her with a can?" he asked watching Timothy walking through the house crying as he looked at his mother's things sitting around the house." who knows what the perpetrator did or thought there is never any logic to murder." He said feeling sorry for the young boy.  That same night Nancy Stevens age sixteen sat in her bedroom combing her long black hair, wearing a red silk night gown, she had a perfect figure for her age she was Polynesian and American and wanted sex tonight. Her mother was out of town for the week while her step father slept in the room next to hers. Larry was in his forty's but she didn't care she needed to be full filled, she tip toed to his room opening the door slowly seeing the tanned construction worker with light brown hair, he was tall and his body was firm and she wanted what he had. He was sleeping on his back in the nude without covering him self as she walked up to the bed dropping her gown to the floor then she sat on top of his body as he opened his eyes.  "Nancy? What?" he tried asking but she began kissing him.  She placed his hands on her breast he gave into the lust of this sixteen year old girl kissing her back seeing she was very experienced in sex.  They had sex all night as he gave her sex with a man she had never known. They both stayed home from work and school finding out she was more experienced in oral sex then her mother was. They never bothered to dress that day. She slept with him in her mother's bed for the rest of the week. When her mother returned she was jealous to see them being affectionate to each other. She listened to their moans that night lying in her bed drove her crazy with jealousy. The next morning as she was dressed in a very short black skirt, a red half top with out a bra on, with knee high boot's, she made sure she came down when he was in the kitchen while her mother was in the shower.  "Where are you going dress like that?" he asked angered by her attire.  "Well I see I am no longer needed around since moaning mommy is back." She said snidely.  He grabbed her by the arm pulling her body up to his running his hands up her shirt kissing her, then up her skirt feeling she had nothing on backing her into the laundry room when he undid his pants pushing her against the wall as he had sex with her the thrill of getting caught turned him on even more. Just as they both reached an orgasm they heard her shutting off the shower.  "I love you Larry, I want it to be just us again. Let's leave." She told him kissing his neck.  "I love you too and I am leaving, but for work." He told her kissing her." Change those clothes; I don't want other guys to see what is mine." He said grabbing her by her ass and squeezing as he left for work.  She watched her mother hatefully as she poured her coffee." So how did you and Larry get along?" she asked sipping her coffee paying her daughters outfit not one bit of attention.  "We got really close." She told her smiling.  "Good because tonight I am telling Larry we are having a baby." Her mother Marie told her feeling happy that she was pregnant by her husband.  "Pregnant? You're pregnant by Larry?" she asked angrily.  "Yes, I didn't think you would mind having a little brother or sister." She told her as Nancy stormed out of the house. He's mine she thought to her self running out to the street.  Knowing her mother would be home alone Nancy snuck back into the house finding her mother a sleep on the couch. Going quietly to the kitchen she grabbed the butcher knife and put on a pair of rubber gloves then going back to the couch where she plunged the knife into her mother's stomach over and over. Her mother laid on the couch bleeding.  "Why have you done this?" she asked bleeding to death.  "Larry loves me! We slept together every night, we even had sex in the laundry while you were showering this morning because he wants me not you!" she told her with so much hate and venom in her voice." Now mother since you know everything say good bye." she said stabbing her in the heart killing her instantly.  She took a shower, washed her clothes, throwing them in the drier before she left for school. When she came home police were all over the place, they stopped her from going inside, and she could hear Larry crying. That's good Larry play it up like you loved her. She thought to her self. "Why can't I go inside it is my house?" she asked the officer.  They had Larry come out of the house to break the news to her that someone killed her mother; she became hysterical calling out for her mother! As Larry held her back tightly in his arms just where she wanted to be.  Larry was taken in for questioning but he had an alibi he was at work and the daughter was at school two murders with in a week and in the same neighborhood, both murders were by someone in a berserk state of mind, used different methods to kill the victims and there were no forced entry to either residence. Larry came home that night he was visibly shaken by the death of his wife. Nancy became upset when he told her they were going to go stay at his sisters for the night.  "Why when we can be alone here? We can not sleep in the same bed at your sisters." She told him looking shocked that he didn't want to be alone with her.  "My wife is dead, murdered and you don't care? All you're thinking about is sleeping with me? Fuck that shit, I never should have even started this with you!" he told her." stay here if you want too but I can't!" he yelled storming out of the room.  She was angry watching him leaving her alone. "Fuck you! I will get even with you." She said dialing the police where she reported that she feels he had something to do with it.  The officer came to the house where she cried when she saw the officer who was young, black hair, brown eyes and tall. He could not help being attracted to the young girl for her beauty was breath taking  "I think he had something to do with my mother's death, he has been sexually abusing me for awhile. My mom told him last night she was pregnant, he became enraged yelling at her he would take care of it him self. He raped me in the laundry room this morning while she was showering and tonight when I told him I couldn't not with it being in the house my poor mother was killed in, he said he'd be back to take care of me too." She told them looking wide eyed and innocent.  "Your mother was pregnant?" the officer asked.  "Yes she told me this morning, she couldn't understand why I was so upset about it." She told him crying.  "Why were you upset?" he asked her.  "Because! It meant we would never be rid of him!" she told him hysterically.  "Have you showered since the rape this morning?" he asked.  "Yes as soon as he left." She said  "Well hopefully there may be something left its doubtful though." he told her taking her to the hospital. On the way to the hospital he kept thinking of her in sexual positions with him becoming aroused.  At the hospital they did a scrapping and unfortunately for Larry there was enough semen to get. They sent it to run a DNA on it.  They released her and the young officer Dennis Shaunsey took her back to her house he asked his superior if he should stay just in case he returned tonight.  They sat in the family room she excused her self so she could get more comfortable changing into a long T shirt as she sat beside him on the couch she began to cry knowing he would take her in his arms. As he brushed her hair from her face he kissed her, she kissed him back, and his hand felt her breast, then in between her thighs feeling her wetness. They undressed where she sat on top of his lap as they sat up; she moved her hips and body in slow circular motions as he kissed her, caressing her breast as they both began to move faster reaching orgasm that left him speechless.  They picked Larry up he denied his wife was pregnant that he would have been told before Nancy, he said they had been sleeping together.  "she came into my room jumped on top of me, began kissing me, making me touch her breast, one thing led to another and we began fucking all the time. So I guess in reality she raped me!" he told them.  "Well your wife was pregnant, three months to be exact. Did you hire someone to kill her so you could keep knocking her daughter in the bed?" an older officer asked.  "I had nothing to do with my wife's death!" He yelled. "That little bitch is setting me up! Can't you see that?" he asked.  "The night of your wife's murder didn't you leave the house angry threatening to take care of her too? Just because your step daughter refused having sex with you since she had just lost her mother? The officer asked him.  "No! It was her wanting us to sleep together that night!" he yelled realizing how Nancy framed him.  Nancy continued seeing Dennis, her father signed papers to be emancipated. She lived in the house that her father had paid off before her parents divorced. Larry convicted and put to death on two counts of murder and rape.  Theresa LoPresti her first year teaching in a high school was twenty four years old with an out look on life that there is good in everyone. She was slim built, shoulder length brown hair, greenish brown eyes; she was five feet six inches tall and engaged to be married on New Years Eve. Two gang members Anton Lincoln and Jeremiah Franklin were in her last period class when the other students left they lingered behind. Anton approached her as she stood with her back to them at the black board. Jeremiah locked the door. Anton grabbed Theresa holding her mouth with his hand as Jeremiah ran to them placing duck tape over her mouth.  "Do anything stupid and we will slit your throat!" Anton told her in a whisper in her ear.  Jeremiah ripped her clothes off of her staring at her nude body. "oh yeah your going to ride me bitch!" he told her pushing her up against the wall kissing her as she cried as his hands roamed her body.  "Were you ever were with a black man before Miss LoPresti?" He asked her licking her breast.  Scared and felt like humiliated for not being able to protect her self shook her head no crying as he took his clothes off lying down on the floor. "Get on and ride me." He ordered her.  Anton holding her and forcing her on top of him watching him enter her. Jeremiah making her go real slow then he wanted it harder knocking her off of him then attacking her sexually on top of her. When Jeremiah was through with her Anton made her get on her knees performing oral on him. Two hours had gone by as they continued the sexual assault on her. She knew they were going to kill her; she had to do what ever it took to get out of there alive. She pretended she liked it even faking an orgasm. Four hours they continued this sexual assault on her body before leaving as she put her clothes on Anton turned to her." Hey teach, you know it's against the law to have sex with a minor?" he asked her almost sounding like they were going to turn it around that she seduced them.  "Yeah we better get A's from now on, you hear me teach?" Jeremiah asked her in a threatening tone of voice.  Once they left she grabbed her cell phone calling the police. That night the boy's ages sixteen and seventeen were picked up and booked into the police station after Theresa identified them as her attackers.  She had to go through the hospital of having them probe her to get the evidence they needed. Her fiancé told her to take the day off to get over it; the room would just be a reminder to her. She knew she would have to face it one day and today might as well be the day.  Theresa entered the room slowly as the rape scene began to replay in her mind over and over. One of her students distracted her memory by dropping a book causing her to jump.  "Sorry Miss. LoPresti." He told her realizing he had scared her.  School had been in session for one hour when her school room door was busted opened by the two assailant's club members. Before anyone could move they shot Theresa in her forehead, killing and wounding most of the students in her class room, shooting as they ran down the hall ways firing at anyone who got into their paths.  They killed Theresa, three of her students, injured a total of seventeen people in the high school. The gang members feeling they had made their statement loud and clear to everyone that day that they would kill anyone who crossed them.  Theresa was laid to rest the same day that the gang members raped three of her female students with the warning they too would join their teacher if they opened their mouths to the authorities.  Timothy received the check from his mother's life insurance policy, the house became legally his that same day. He felt on top of the world, he committed the perfect murder and no one was even wise to him. That night as he sat in the family room watching television he heard a thud in the kitchen, he didn't pay any attention to it then he heard it again this time he went to the kitchen to see his mothers wheel chair hitting against the counter as if it was stuck. Timothy becoming fearful ran to his bedroom as he heard his mother calling for him, her voice was getting closer as he covered himself up completely crying under his covers.  "Tim is you in bed?" he heard his girlfriend ask.  "Oh hey Georgia, I didn't think you were going to make it tonight." He said sitting up.  "Well we can get started on our lesson of love making." She told him taking her red dress off as she walked towards the bed. She was a tall red head, her hair was long and wavy, and she was much endowed and very shapely.  She began to kiss him as she sat on top of him moving slowly as he caressed her breast. He closed his eyes feeling the passions growing with in him. He was almost ready to achieve an orgasm when he heard his mother's voice.  "Timmy, mother has something for you." She said sounding very close by. He opened his eyes and began screaming as he was frozen with fear and could not move.  "Here's your fucking green beans!" she yelled as it was his mother sitting on top of him with her brains hanging out of her skull as she began bashing him in the head over and over again until he was dead.  They found him two days later in bed nude with the can of green beans in his hand. The police were dumb founded and in his parents will if anything happened to Tim their property and money was to be divided up between his aunt and the rest was to go to the less fortunate.  Nancy lay in her bed waiting for Dennis to come by during his lunch so they could make love. She heard his foot steps in the hall way she closed her eyes pretending to be a sleep, she felt her covers being pulled back , her breast being caressed then her night gown ripped off of her. She opened her eyes quickly seeing Larry with his skin decomposing; some of his flesh was falling off while he began raping her. "Now I have raped you bitch! Go call the law and tell them now!" He told her grinning as he kissed her with the rotting flesh of his lips.  When he stepped away from the bed her mother began stabbing her repeatedly in the stomach. "We are together for eternity and you're coming to join us!" she yelled plunging the knife in her then pulling it out and laying it in Nancy's hand. Dennis found her that night, the police could not figure out why two murders in one night?  That same night as the gang members were all hanging out in their club house Theresa and her three students came walking in as they each walked towards a gang member they would fire their gun killing each other as the bullets just went through Theresa and her students killing each other. They looked around the room and the gang members had successfully killed each other trying to kill the walking dead who had succeeded in avenging their deaths. Smiling they all vanished in a gold sparkling mist except for Theresa who showed up in the cell with Anton pulling back his covers she began performing oral sex on him, when he opened his eyes he began screaming trying to get away from her.  "Come here and finish our fuck session!" she demanded of him as her flesh was gray and smelt from rotting, her eyes dark with black rings around them, she opened her mouth as maggots fell out on to the floor.  He began screaming and crying begging her to stay away from him when the guards came opening the cell, he charged at them to get away from Theresa who was coming towards him smiling. They ordered him to stop or they would shoot, but he kept running until he dropped dead from their bullets. She smiled for she had one more cell to visit now dear Jeremiah.  He lay on his back dreaming he was having sex with a gorgeous blond, it began feeling so real as if she was really on top of him when he woke up seeing Theresa on top of him with the gaping bullet whole oozing out green puss as her skin was rotting and dropping off on to his chest. He screamed a blood curdling scream when his heart stopped beating from the fright he experienced seeing her. The mortician could not remove the frozen look of fear from his face.  Leanne appeared in the room where her foster father was raping another young foster child in her bed. Leanne taking a sharp butcher knife from the kitchen before coming into the room ran it as far up his rectum as possible. He began screaming from the pain the last thing he saw or heard before she plunged it in to him repeatedly was her smiling and saying to him." Doesn't feel to good do it?" Once he was dead she looked at the frightened little girl crying on the bed. "Run fast she is coming! They will say you did it! They never  Believe us when we do tell the truth. "Leanne told the small child looking sadly at the girl she saved was only eight years old. She escaped through the window running to where ever she would be safe. The police found her wandering the streets where she told them how the bad man had hurt her, that when he went to the bathroom she was able to slip out the window of the bedroom. After being examined she was found to have been raped as she told them. They figured the wife killed him for letting her get away as it was her finger prints on the knife that she had used to cut up meat for dinner that night. the small girl told how they both would beat her and torture her with her soap in socks, and tying her hands together making her hang inches from the floor with a rope they had tied to a rod they had installed across the ceiling of her room hanging stuffed animals on it so the social workers wouldn't suspect them of anything.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © A Jury of twelve found her guilty of first degree Murder and guilty of child abuse as twenty other children came forward to the abuse they too had to endure while in the safe care of the two foster parents that the social workers checked out finding them up standing citizens, even though the husband had spent fifteen years in prison for robbery, drug possession charges.  Leanne smiled down from Heaven knowing that she been vindicated for the crimes they did to her in her short period of life on Earth.  The last month  The Dark Side leader the High Source sat in his luxurious dungeon, filled with the finest furnishings of gold torches lighting it by the flames they produced through out the dungeon that had a room for the rituals and sacrifices with beds, a gold altar with black candles all around it on the other side of the room a table where they feasted on flesh and drank blood, there was even a council room with conference tables and chairs where the highest of demons and the High source held their meetings for the plan of destroying innocent.  The High Source had his private room filled with a round bed, mirrors, chains, whips, all kinds of sexual toys that he used to torture some of the demons male or female he had sex with. His favorite the seductive fairy Orinda she was beautiful beyond belief with long black wavy hair past her full perfect rounded buttocks, ivory skin with eyes of velvet that glowed a florescent purple when she seduced the men or women casting her spell on them. After they had her sexually they would willingly walk away from their families to return to her. Once they willingly gave them selves to the Dark Side to be with her she would sink her teeth into their jugular vein killing them and sending them to join the Dark Sides army. The High Source captured her in the mountains for he lusted after her beauty. For mountain fairies are friendly and very beautiful taking in lost travelers who would stay for a week with them. The males how ever would return to the mountain fairies leaving their families. The High Source turned her into a blood sucking demon that could walk the earth day or night with other evil supernatural powers. She'd walk around the dungeon naked pleasuring demons that interested her. The High Source a huge demon with black scaly skin, his head was large with pointed ears, his eyes glowed red horns, long fingers with razor like nails. He would be sending her to see how much chaos she would be able to cause to the mortals before the white light warriors and the Dark Side warriors battled in the sky's as the mortals watched being slaughtered by the evil humans on earth. He lay in his bed waiting for her to come to him before she leaves. She enters walking slowly to him smiling.  "How may I pleasure you my master?" she asked as she slowly crawled up his large body kissing his body and caressing him, she laid on top of his hard scaly body kissing him as his hands caressed her body as she sat up riding the demon giving him the pleasures he desired and the lust she craved he full filled.  "When your job is done with mortals I have chosen you as my queen." As he watched her achieving an orgasm then turning her on her back he began ravishing her body that would be completely his soon, with this knowledge that she would be his queen he had an explosive orgasm. He lay in his bed watching her leave to begin her destruction of human lives.  She appeared in front of a bar that most men visited after work before going home to their wives and children for their after work drink. She wore a tight long sleeved lavender dress that had a lavender broach built in with a diamond pendant in the center, the dress was cut low over her breast, her spiked heels matched perfectly to the dress. As she walked through the bar smiling which was filled with mostly men she over heard that tonight was his one year anniversary. Perfect she thought to her self sitting next to him at the bar. She looked at the man named Juan dressed in a blue business suit he was very well built like he worked out every day, he was tall, and he was Hispanic with blue eyes and black hair. As soon as Orinda sat next to him he was taken by her beauty and suddenly was not in a hurry to leave. What will one more drink hurt? He thought to him self looking at her smiling.  "May I buy you a drink?" he asked looking at her breast and body.  "Yes thank you." She told him smiling touching his hand that sent desire for her through him.  "Would you like to move to table over in the corner?" he asked forgetting his wife and anniversary.  "Great let's move to the one in the corner." She said pointing to the one in the dark and offs by it self.  They sat there for an hour talking and laughing he had placed his arm around her chair and every once in a while would stroke the back of her hair. He leaned over kissing her softly on the lips.  "I want you." He told her kissing more as his hand caressed her breast where no one could see what he was actually doing.  "Let's go then." She told him smiling.  They left the bar checking into a hotel room, he was even more under her spell when they stood naked in front of each other. He took her in his arms as he touches her body all over. He picked her up in his arms carrying her to the bed where he made passionate love to her that he never even made to his wife. Her eyes glowed as her spell was being fully cast upon him. He was totally oblivious to her eyes that glowed Florissant purple as he stared deep into them. They made love all night in the room. The next morning when they woke up in each others arms he knew he would have to leave her and it pained him to have to separate from her.  "I will rent the room for a week if you'll stay here." He told her kissing her.  She looked at him smiling kissing him." I will stay only if you're coming back here." She told him as she fondled him smiling." one for the road big guy?" she asked laughing as he began kissing her.  Juan's wife Sherry was up all night, she searched the streets in her car unable to find him. She could not believe he was not hurt or worse to stay gone all night when last night was their one year anniversary. Sherry was blond with long hair, blue eyes, she could have been a fashion model with her looks and body. The police told her he had to be missing for twenty four hours before they could do anything. She cried sitting in her living on the love seat they shared every night holding their wedding picture crying. Juan came walking in the door, he looked at her and with out saying a word went to his bedroom where he began packing.  "Where have you been?" sherry asked following him into the room shocked to see him packing. "Where are you going?" she asked sniffling.  Juan did not answer her or even look at her until she grabbed him." where the fuck are you going? You've been with another woman I can smell the slut all over you!" she yelled at him breaking their wedding picture.  Juan slapped her across the face knocking her to the floor." She is not a slut!" he told her as he headed towards the door." Have a great life Sherry, I won't be coming back. "he told walking out of the bedroom and her life  "Fuck you! you son of a bitch!" she yelled still on the floor crying hysterical as her marriage just crumbled around her with out an explanation of this other woman just, have a great life." Like hell you'll just walk out on me!" she said angered by being tossed away like yesterdays left over as she got to her feet running out of the house she could still see his car.  Sherry hurriedly got into her car squealing the tires as she backed out of the drive way. "oh your bitch is going to have to fight for you if she wants you Mr. Juan!" she said looking in her rear view mirror seeing his hand print beginning to swell." Bastard! Hit me will you?" she said following far enough behind where he could not see her.  She parked far enough so she could follow him into the hotel with out him seeing her. She watched the floor he took the elevator to. She walked up to the desk clerk a short elderly man that was slightly plump, wearing wire framed glasses, clean shaven and reminded her of a butler." that man who just got on the elevator is Juan Garcia, my husband and as you can see by my face he has assaulted me." She said breaking down into tears trying to finish her sentence placing her hand over her mouth as this seemed like a night mare to her." please call the police I wish to press charges against him." She told him looking at him through her tear filled eyes as her cheek was swelling and beginning to discolor.  "Are you alright other then your face?" asked the desk clerk who was concerned for her safety she reminded him of his daughter." my name is Maurice, please come into my office where you will be safe in case they should come down.  So she is up there too. Sherry thought to her self." Thank you." she told him trying to smile. Fuck him in jail bitch. She thought following Maurice to his office where she waited for the police to arrive drinking the hot coffee Maurice had brought to her.  Juan and Orinda lay on the bed kissing when she looked at him rising up on one arm lying on her side." Would you like to be with me forever?" She asked looking seriously.  "Yes Orinda you are who I want to be with forever." He told her smiling touching her face softly.  "Would you be willing to join me in the Dark Side as a warrior to fight against our enemies?" she asked him running her finger along his shirt covering his chest.  He smiled taking her in his arms." Baby I would go anywhere you wanted and be anything you wanted me to be, I would fight all of your enemies to protect you from harm that ever came your way." He told her holding the side of her face kissing her.  Smiling she raised up adjusting herself to sit on top of him as he thought she was the most gorgeous woman in the lavender negligee smiling down at him as her eyes began to glow leaning down towards him as she opened her mouth to sink her fangs into his neck.  There was a loud banging on the door startling them both they looked at the door. Juan got up off the bed walking to the door when he opened it he saw Sherry with two very large police officers.  "Is this your husband who hit you?" The younger officer asked Sherry.  "Yes that's him!" she told him crying as she became upset seeing Orinda standing behind her husband.  "Your wife said you struck her in her face knocking her to the ground, is this true?" The officer asked while his partner watched the couple in the room.  "Yes I hit her! She called Orinda a slut! She is not one to be judging who is a slut." He told them feeling justifiable in his actions as he shot daggers at his wife.  "Well you're married to Sherry Garcia, leaving her the day after your one year anniversary after spending the night with this one so I doubt that Mrs. Garcia is the slut sir. Turn around and place your hands behind your back your under arrest for assault and battery." The older shorter officer told Juan.  "You bitch!" he yelled as the police grabbed him.  "I am very sorry officers, but I can't allow you to take him." Orinda told them stepping to the side of Juan.  "Really? You can't allow us?" the younger one asked almost laughing.  "That's right and now you three will be leaving." She said looking at the younger officer evilly as a flame appeared in her hand.  "What the hell?" the older officer asked as Sherry began backing up and running down the corridor.  she ran she hearing their screams as Orinda set them a blaze as she looked back terrified before she could even think the word help Orinda blasted her with a torch racing flame which broke her spell on Juan as he cried out Sherry's name when Orinda pushed him back into the room knocking him so hard he flew on the bed where she leaped on top of him in a matter of seconds .  "Your mine!" she hissed at him then sucked his blood from his body. She smiled at his lifeless body." Welcome soldier "she told him kissing his lips smiling then sent him on his way to the Dark side.  Maurice came to see what the disturbance was when he saw the charred remains of the police officers and Sherry Garcia as other guest stuck their heads out with horrified expressions.  "Call for help, sweet Jesus Satan is loose." he said making the crucifix across his chest with his hand walking towards the open door when Orinda and Juan were staying in to find it empty as if no one had been inside at all.  Orinda dressed in a black shiny half shirt with matching slacks that fit very low on her hips and were wide at the leg's with a pair of black shiny opened toe heels, her hair pulled up into a tight pony tail, her make up almost made her look oriental with just the foundation and thick lined black eye liner. She sat next to a tall, thin African American man dressed very nicely in a yellow pull over dress shirt, white pants and white shoes. He must have been in his fifty's. he looked over at her looking at her body wishing women looked like that when he was younger smiling at her he thought to him self what the hell I will give it a shot to see if she likes older men. What his wife didn't know wouldn't hurt her  "Hello my name is Fred and could I buy a gorgeous lady like your self a drink?" he asked leaning more towards her looking into those beautiful eyes that seemed to make him desire her more.  "Yes please a screw driver." She told him.  "If you have the screw I have the driver." He told her smiling it was his oldest pick up line.  "I might want to borrow it tonight." She told him smiling running her hand up his leg to the inner thigh and feeling his crotch. "oh and such a nice size one too." She told him smiling as he leaned over kissing her as his buddies watched in surprise that he was going to have her tonight.  What a lucky bastard Clifton a heavy man in Fred's age group thought to him self watching his friend getting more and more into kissing the gorgeous young woman. Five minutes he'll be leaving with her. He thought to him self smiling. And they did just as he predicted going to a hotel.  She undressed him kissing his body removing his clothing then getting on her knees to pleasure him orally. He was beginning to feel him self getting weak in the knees as the orgasm exploded like a volcano for this was the first time he experienced oral sex. He then undressed her caressing her breast, kissing her body laying her on the bed where he pleasured her with oral sex loving how her body moved as he tasted her sweet juices, how she massaged her breast then gripping the side of the bed when she exploded moaning such erotic pleasures as she had an orgasm. Surprised he was aroused again he lay on his back as she rode him slowly sitting straight up massaging her hardened nipples when he could not take it any longer throwing her on her back and entering her feeling more passion flow through his body then he ever felt with any other woman before. When he finally looked at the clock it was eight in the morning and he did not care that his wife was furious.  Thelma paced the floor as her and Fred's four boys ranging in ages of five years old to eighteen years old running through there small three bedroom white wooden house. By noon, her and her eighteen year old and sixteen year old son's became worried about Fred. Curtis,  Thelma's eighteen year old son went to his friends house's no one had seen him until he got to Clifton's house who had just read in the news paper of the two police officers and Sherry being torched to death so severely there were hardly any remains left of their bodies, the police were still looking for Juan Garcia and the mysterious woman he was with at the motel. Clifton told him the woman matched the description of the woman the police are looking for.  Curtis began calling the entire hotel from Clifton until he found the hotel he was at. Both men went there telling the desk clerk it was his fathers birthday and he was there to surprise him since he just flew in from Texas. The clerk figuring there wouldn't be any harm sent them up to their room. The men could hear the moans coming from inside the room. Fred had given her his word to join her in the Dark Side battle. Curtis banged on the door so loud the whole place went silent. Fred opened the door finding his son and friend standing there.  "What the hell do you two want?" he asked with just the sheet wrapped around him as Orinda lay in the bed naked.  "You need to come home now pop's." Curtis told his father feeling betrayed by him.  "I am never going back son, tell your mama good bye for me." He said trying to shut the door.  "Fuck you old man you tell her self. You were man enough to fuck a whore all night be man enough to break it off with your wife of twenty nine years your self!" he yelled as his father punched him.  Orinda had become aggregated with the whole situation. "Hurry Fred we are not done." She told him for she had just been ready to take his life when they were interrupted.  "No, but we are through Father!" Curtis told him as tears formed in his big brown eyes.  "Bastard!" Fred yelled as the two men walked away.  Orinda stood by the window watching for the two men as Fred stood behind her caressing and kissing her neck when she spotted them casting two huge lightening bolts down killing them both then turned to Fred with her eyes glowing sinking her teeth into his flesh. Then they both vanished. The official ruling for the cause of the two men being struck by lightening was due to a freak of nature since it was a sunny day with not a cloud in the sky.  Orinda showed up that night at another bar in an oriental opal colored satin dress with her hair up in a bun and wearing opal tear dropped earrings with matching shoes and hand bag. She spotted a very handsome man, he must have been in his forties and his body was so built. Well I will not mind seducing this one. She thought smiling to her self sitting next to him. He did not even look at her at all just looking straight a head drinking his bourbon on the rocks.  Orinda decided she would make the move on him." Hello I am..." he stopped her before she could even say another word.  "Orinda and now we are leaving." he told her grabbing her by the arm.  She was stunned as he led her out of the bar." I am Knight Shadow well you may think now I am your night mare instead." He told her smiling.  She looked at him realizing who he was." The High Priest of the White Light warriors." She said slowly, then looking almost relieved." Please do vanquish me and put me out of my misery of this evil creature The High Source turned me into. I am a mountain Fairy I do not want to hurt people to make them join his forces." She told him crying finally relieved to be released from him. "God take mercy on the souls I have stolen through deceit and myself if you can forgive me Father." She said looking up at the sky crying meaning every word she said.  Knight Shadow looked at her. "Our Higher Power does not punish those who are good Orinda, even if they did acts of evil due to spells. So it is my wish that Orinda be released from this demons hell and let the Higher Power cleanse her soul as she wished." He said as she vanquished from the street where they stood as everything stopped in time. It is said that a spirit of a mountain fairy can be heard and seen dancing and laughing through the mountains as she casts off a gold glittering aura.  As time grew closer for the battle of evil verse's good the world was becoming unstable not with just crimes but with mother nature her self as the Dark Side would send tremendous storms without warning. So many peoples lives were taken during these storms, the weather forecasters could not explain them. Natannie Bear sat in her apartment she shared with her boyfriend Ron Deutch and her sister Shadaisha Bear. She began to have a premonition of evil approaching. Natannie and her sister Shadaisha were identical twins, they had long black hair, brown eyes, they were average height and they both had athletic bodies. They both wore a charm given to them by their mother to keep the Raven mocker away. The charms were filled with a strong medicine made by a medicine man, who would sit at the doors of sick people to keep the Raven Mocker out of the home. The Raven Mocker would go in to the house invisible scaring the poor sick person so bad that they died. The Raven Mocker ate their hearts to add to his years by stealing their remaining years and it rejuvenated him. There is not any trace of where he removed the heart. A Raven Mocker is old and withered looking, they can also be female; they soar from the skies to where ill victims laying in bed with the cry of the Raven as it is diving only so much more intense that the ones who can hear The Raven Mocker their hearts and bodies are filled with fear. The only way to kill them is with a strong medicine once the Raven Mocker sees the person with the medicine he tries to flee from them for once they are recognized in their true form they die in seven days. Natannie and Shadaisha mother had the charms made when three Raven Mockers came and stole their fathers remaining years when he became very ill from a rare blood infection. The Raven Mockers came in a group of three where they actually would pick him up tossing him on the floor, his wife thinking he was having some kind of an attack since she could not see the Raven Mockers a husband, wife and her brother. A medicine man heard of the ill man hearing the cry of the Raven Mocker then knew where to find it. Unfortunately the medicine man got to the house to late. They had tormented the man so much he let go of the life with in him. When the medicine man saw the Raven Mocker's standing in front of the house they lived in next door of the man they killed the medicine man looked at them and they knew their days were numbered. Seven days later their bodies were found dead in their living room as each lay on the floor as if they were preparing to leave the house when they suddenly dropped dead.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © Natannie sat in her over stuffed black leather chair when she had another vision of thousands of Raven Mocker's flying down from the sky and preying on the sick in hospitals, in their homes, she could hear their raven cries it was becoming deafening to her ears where she sat in the chair dressed in her boyfriends boxer shorts and one of his FBI T shirts. She had her feet up in the chair holding her ears when Shadaisha came in seeing her sister looking as if she was in sever pain as tears rolled down her face. "Natannie what is wrong with you?" she asked rushing to her sister touching her leg she felt and heard her sister's vision it caused her to drop to her knees.  "What is happening? Why are you seeing these evil creatures?" she asked Natannie for now she was frightened for her sister's visions always came true.  Finally the vision ceased she felt relief from the pain." Evil is going to cast a horrible disease that can't be cured and people will get it so the evil can release all the Raven Mocker's down to steal their years from them causing their deaths." Natannie told her sister crying as she spoke." The disease is so highly contagious you just pass a person and you are infected with it." Natannie told Shadaisha as they both cried for fear of the Raven Mocker's taking their years as they did their beloved father.  When their mother became ill the sisters and the medicine man sat around her bed preventing the Raven Mockers from entering the house as the girls wore their charms and the medicine man had his in his medicine pouch. The medicine man had long silver hair; he wore a wide brim hat, a white long sleeve shirt, with a multi colored vest, black jeans and moccasin boots. When he tracks a Raven Mocker and they die, he sits with the body until it is buried in the ground. It is there that the evil witches unearths the Raven Mocker and abuses his corpse for in the Raven Mocker's life even the witches feared them.  Ron came home from work finding the two women upset, hearing the story he found it hard to believe. Raven Mockers, it is just an old folk lore of the Cherokees. He thought to him self. Natannie told him more of her vision of the horrible disease that would kill hundreds of people and there was not a cure for it. Ron was tall and medium built, his hair was dark brown as were his eyes. He was an F.B.I. agent and found her hard to believe.  "Ok. Your telling me that thousands of these Raven Mockers will be attacking sick people from this disease that these evil ones are sending to us and then the Raven Mockers will steal what years of life the victim had left?" he asked her looking at her strangely.  "Yes that is exactly what I am telling you! The end of time is coming very soon." Natannie told him looking very scared.  "So what can we do Natannie? Send some F.B.I. agent's into hell to stop the bad guys?" He asked her in a patronizing tone of voice.  Natannie looked at him seriously." No Ron because there will not be an agency much alone agents. "She told him looking at Shadaisha who believed in her sister's visions and knew she was telling the truth that the Great War was going to begin as told to them by the Chief of their tribe.  Natannie rose from her chair looking very sad into her sister's eyes. She knew they must start preparing for the Great War that their mother told them this was to be their destiny. In their bed rooms they prayed to the protector who at one time had been an injured wolf found by seven young girls who were trying to find their tribe before the approaching danger could find them. The seven girls forgetting of the danger tracking them nursed the wolf back to health who became their protector. When the danger found the girls, the wolf gave the eerie sounding howl of the wolf. Soon the wolf's pack had circled the girls keeping the danger from getting to them, which was the serpent, who could transform into human shape. The wolves defeated the evil creature before the tribe found the girls. Fearing for the safety of their daughters, they killed every one of the wolves. When the daughters told them of the horrible mistake they made they vowed to honor the wolf and their spirits became the protector of women.  Over their window was a Mandela to help bring good luck to the house, over there beds were dream catchers to catch the evil dreams into its webbing and allows the good ones to enter. There were spirit chimes and medicine wheels. Natannie and Shadaisha practiced their spiritual beliefs everyday.  Ron came into the room finding Natannie crying, seeing her cry tore his heart out. He walked to the bed where she sat taking her in his arms as he sat next to her." I am sorry I hurt your feelings Natannie." He told her kissing her forehead.  "It's not you Ron, but soon it will come to pass and you'll know I was telling the truth." She told him holding on to him tightly.  As Natannie and Shadaisha slept, their parents came to them in their dreams. "You our precious daughter's have been chosen to be great warriors. You will suffer sadness but it brings a visitor who will explain what you must do." Their parents kissed both of their daughter's and then a beautiful female warrior took them back. dressed in a white suede halter top that tied around her neck and around her waist, with fringe dangling from the bottom edge of the top a short warrior's skirt that had the side opened at the waist, her head dress was all white with long feathers going down her back, white boot moccasins. Her hair was long and black she smiled at them as she departed with their parents.  That morning in the kitchen over breakfast, they told each other their dreams realizing they did come to them. "Wonder who the visitor will be?" Shadaisha asked.  Natannie sipped her coffee, as Ron was dressed and ready to leave for work Natannie whispered. "I don't know, but they will explain to us what is going on." She did not want him to hear them as he came into the kitchen.  "I will see you ladies tonight." He said smiling kissing Natannie good-bye.  Natannie sat in the living room at her computer writing a book on her heritage and belief, suddenly she had a vision of an old Indian man with long white hair, a band around his head, dressed in clothes made from buckskin. He was sitting in the dark with the fire as it cast mystical looking sparks into the air rising to the sky. He was chanting in the Cherokee native tongue. She wondered what it meant. She wrote down the words as she watched the vision as if it was on a screen in front of her. A beautiful white wolf appeared beside him, the wolf gave a howl into the night and then it looked as if it looked right into her eyes as the Indian man kept chanting never stopping. The vision disappeared as the wolf disappeared into the darkness.  Natannie went online to get the chant translated. She was confused as to what it said.  The great white wolf is your sister and you two shall become one before long. Natannie was very confused by all of this. What does it mean? She thought to her self.  Natannie's heart sank when she read that an unknown disease had already killed forty people in Europe and several cases had been located in the United States. There was not any kind of treatment for it. "It is here." She said a loud to herself.  The phone began to ring it was Ron he had heard the news and apologized for doubting her visions. He knew there was not anyway she could have known before today. Natannie hung the phone up.  "That is why I heard your death calls; you were stealing those innocent people's years." She said looking out the window at the sky.  Natannie quickly dressed in a pair of faded blue jeans, with wide legged bottoms, a black pull over sleeveless half top, a suede belt with her native design and colors, long fringe hanging at the each end of it. Her brown suede moccasins, she put on her medicine wheel earrings and grabbed Shadaisha's earrings to take to her job where she was tending bar at the local pub down the street.  When she asked for Shadaisha they told her Shadaisha was rushed to the hospital, she became very ill and past out. Natannie knew what it was. "No! You won't take her." She said going out of the pub the owner looking at her strangely shaking his head.  As she ran down the street, she heard the Raven Mockers cries then the wolf howl as if to chase the Raven Mocker away. Natannie ran all the way there to find her sister in intensive care. They allowed her to sit with her. Natannie held her hand as Shadaisha fought for life. She could feel the Raven Mocker waiting at the door but the medicine in the charms was holding the evil creature off.  Natannie called Ron telling what had happened that he needed to get to the hospital quickly. He had permission for the helicopter to deliver him there so he could be by Natannie and her sister. As he past every old person, he would call them a Raven Mocker, he believed in her visions now. He was devastated by how fast the disease was taking her life. Two nurses came in to give her medicine to ease her pain and asked them to step outside while they changed her gown. Natannie looked back to see one nurse trying to take off the charm.  "No do not remove it! You will let the Raven Mocker in! She'll die!" She told them getting upset.  "Ok we will leave it on her." They told her.  As they sat in the waiting room, the hospital called a code blue, doctors, and nurses went running to Shadaisha's room. Natannie began running from the waiting room down the hall where the two nurses stood looking at her very pale looking.  "you removed it didn't you?" she asked them angrily when she saw an old woman quickly walking down the hall." Raven Mocker! You now have seven days of life!" Natannie yelled at the old woman who turned with the look of knowledge to what she just yelled at her.  "My sister is dead! Because of you!" she yelled as tears ran down her face.  'It was the disease." One nurse told her.  "Check her chest cavity her heart will be gone because they are feeding on the people's hearts stealing their years." She told them crying. "I mean it! I want a fucking autopsy done do you understand?" she cried out at the hospital staff.  Ron waiting with Natannie while they did a special rush autopsy on Shadaisha. The doctor could not believe that she was telling the truth, Shadaisha's heart was gone.  "In all my years as a doctor I have never encounter such a case, there was not one trace of evidence that the heart had been removed." He told Natannie and Ron. He reminded Ron of Quincy the television show, in looks and actions.  There was an order placed for all the patients who had died to have their chest cavities check where the same thing happened their hearts were gone. Natannie gained the ability to detect a Raven Mocker calling them by Raven Mocker with only seven days to live. She wore both charms of the medicine, and mourned her sister deeply.  A month had gone by since Shadaisha's death; Ron had already left for work. Natannie stood by the fireplace looking at Shadaisha's picture, she heard Shadaisha's door opening. Natannie turned to see who was coming out of it when she saw the white wolf coming into the living room. Natannie stood still not fearing the wolf at all. The wolf sat down in front of her. Natannie looked at her smiling.  "Welcome home my sister." She told the wolf that had beautiful blue eyes.  The wolf transformed into Shadaisha spirit. She was dressed in a beautiful white out fit; it resembled the fur of the wolf. The top was a vest, and the bottom was the warrior's loincloth, with a flap of white soft material in the front and back. the head dress was all white except around the band was designed with turquoise and silver beads, she wore a silver and blue choker around her neck and both of her wrist, a silver slave bracelet around her upper arm, her moccasin boots matched her out fit.  "Natannie the time has come for us to be joined as one." Shadaisha told her as she walked towards her and then her spirit entered Natannie's body.  Natannie felt a surge of energy and knew she now had special powers. Someone knocked on her door; she walked towards the door knowing it was the one who would explain to her what was going to happen to them in the fight against evil. She opened the door to find a beautiful woman with long dark brown hair.  "Natannie Shadaisha I have been waiting to meet you." Mystical Shadow told her.  "You called me Natannie Shadaisha why?" she asked the mysterious woman.  "You carry your sister's warrior soul don't you?" She asked her smiling.  "You're a witch." She told her suddenly knowing who she was. "The High Priestess of the white light." She whispered.  "Yes, we're not too much different in our beliefs of spirits, magic, charms, potions, visions of things to come." She told Natannie.  Natannie thought and she was right, "ok you got me on that one we do have similar beliefs." She told her.  The two women sat down and began to talk about the up coming war in one week. As they were discussing things, Natannie had a vision of Ron attacked by a huge Demon in an alley. She suddenly transformed into the wolf running through the closed door.  "I am right behind you girl." Mystical shadow told her as she vanished.  Mystical shadow appeared in the alley as the wolf was crouched and growling at the demon known as Apparatus. He was seven feet tall, weighed four hundred pounds and looked like a horned demon with red glowing eyes, and claws for fingers. He looked at Mystical shadow who was smiling at him as he held Ron up in the air by his neck.  "Put him down now." Mystical shadow told him.  Natannie appeared now as Shadaisha throwing a flaming arrow into his chest causing him to drop Ron on the ground. Through her powers she now had she floated Ron behind her and Mystical shadow.  Ron could not believe what he was seeing when he heard Mystical shadow began to chant her spell. "I mystical Shadow the High Priestess of the White light order this foul smelling creature to be added to a new feature and that is in the lake of hell for eternity he'll spend his term in his fiery jail." She said as she blew him up.  Ron looked and saw his body laying where the demon had dropped him, but how could I be here, and laying there? He asked himself when the realization hit him, he was dead, and "I am dead!" he shouted in a panicked voice.  Mystic Shadow looked at Ron. "Calm down and step back into your body, I will heal you." She told him. "Hurry I have three minutes left to bring you back." She told him as he stepped back into his lifeless body. Mystic shadow laid her hands on him as a bright light glowed around them for a few minutes and he was alive again.  Before the three of them left, the area Mystic shadow left two dead clones of Ron and Natannie. She saw who was behind this; it was the director of the FBI. He knew of Natannie and Shadaisha becoming one powerful warrior, knowing that she would see the vision and rush to help Ron, the one thing he did not count on was Mystic shadow being there. Mystic shadow took them back with her to protect them from the Dark Side.  Natannie changed into a white dress with a light blue trim in the shape of a V from her neck to her cleavage, the fringe trimmed the out lining of the V, a single feather in her long black hair on the left side, the sleeves were wide like wings with white fringe hanging from the bottom of the arms and the bottom of the hem of the dress, that was just below her knees. Her white moccasins boots were below her knees trimmed in fringed, and lace up the front in white suede. She looked beautiful.  Mystic Shadow watched as the warriors trained Ron for combat and Natannie laughing when he tripped trying to avoid the fireballs shot at him. Mystical Shadow slipped away with out being missed as she popped into the director's office as his mistress Alison.  "I have been waiting for you, what took you so long to show up?" he asked feeling irritated because his wife could show up any minute.  Mystic shadow smiled as she thought of the woman being tied up by magical rope." I am sorry I got tied up in traffic." She told him as she flung her blond hair back wearing a red top and a tight white skirt showing the out line of her red thong as she walked over to him unbuttoning her shirt sitting down on his lap. As he, UN snapped the front of her bra caressing her breast.  "These were definitely worth the investment to enlarge them." he them began kissing and licking her nipples. He was bald; he was over weight with big bulging eyes. "I have to have you now." He told her ripping her panties off and entering her as he laid her on his desk. It was only a few minutes and he reached a climax. "Well here is one hundred dollars and tonight you have to be with the assistant director when they come for him. Before the week is over we will have replaced all the mortal leaders before the war even starts." He laughed as he kissed her good bye.  Mystic shadow returned to her own body as she popped into the woman's apartment. She went to the closet, placing her hands on the woman's temples extracting the demon from her body. The woman was dead that the demon had replaced.  "Say good bye chucky baby." She told the green skinned demon, with purple glowing eyes, long claws and webbed feet, its hair brown and stringy with ears that looked like bat wings. Mystic Shadow vanquished the demon before it could even think.  Mystic Shadow went to the home of assistant director where she explained to him what was happening, she took him back with her replacing a clone of him to be killed. The warriors were sent through out the world to rid the powerful offices of the demons and replacing them with clones.  Mystic Shadow appeared in the office of the director unbuttoning her top as always when she stopped. "I want to give you a blow job." She told him licking her lips slowly as soon as he had removed his penis from his pants she blew him up. "Oops! I got confused I meant I wanted to blow you up." She told the ashes that were left behind. On her way out she left behind the clone of the dead director.  Mystic Shadow appeared in the office of the President of the united state, he was the first African American to be elected to office just three months ago and a week later the Dark Sides leader had taken over his body. She appeared as the director's mistress. She was dressed in a black leather jacket, short skirt and black boots.  "The director sent me here to make sure you had everything you needed." She told him smiling.  "Come here and let me see you up closer." He said smiling as he walked around his desk.  She walked up to him when suddenly he grabbed her kissing her as his tongue ran into her mouth. She realized he had tied her in chains.  "Mystic Shadow , how nice of you to come to see me, pleasure me you will since your husband took my Queen away from me." He said smiling touching her breast. "Now I will take his in every way before killing you." He held her tighter against his body when they were in his dungeon in his room. He laughed as he transformed into his hideous grotesque self.  He had somehow frozen her powers her heart began beating fast. He ripped her clothes off as well as the chains throwing her on his bed; she began to scream as he tried to enter her body to rape her. Mystic Shadow was powerless and helpless.  Suddenly she recognized a voice yelling for the demon master to release her. Flame Caster had heard her screams before the demon master could reach Flame Caster he blew him up in one huge fireball and quickly wrapped a blanket around Mystic Shadow as they vanished from the dungeon. Once back home her powers slowly returned to her as she and the other seven witches made potions, spells, training harder then they ever trained for any battle. They knew some were not coming back, that they would be going home.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings © The night before the battle was to take place they threw a surprise birthday party for the twins. The eight original witches dressed in their traditional sexy gowns of the same design just different colors.  Mystic Shadow wore a white opal gown that would change different shades as the light hit it just right. Mystic Caster wore a black sequined gown, Mystical Lightening wore a half black and half white opal dress in honor of her mother and grand mother, Natannie wore a long white gown made of suede, with thin straps across the shoulder and criss crossed in the back. Fringe was embroider across the top of her breast, with white suede hills with fringe across the toes, a single feather in her hair.. The men were all in black tuxedos.  Knight Shadow and Mystical Shadow danced as they did when they first met. She would rub her body very seductively, up against his then grinding down to the floor and he'd pull her up slowly, close to his body with his face inches away from her lips. As the party was going into the night Knight Shadow and Mystic shadow appeared at the lighthouse where they spent many hours there before. As they sat on the bench, she straddled his lap facing him as they made love to each other as they did years ago with her kissing him hungrily. He kissed her neck softly, as she moved her hips slowly; he ran his hands over her dress feeling how she still reacted to his touch with a slight moan from deep with in her. He was her love and only love. He felt her passions getting more intense as she ran her hands over her breast, down her stomach with her eyes closed, her lips partly opened moaning , it drove him wild with desire as they both experienced the most intensified orgasm ever.  They returned to the party everyone was eating and drinking, Knight Shadow and Mystic Shadow gave Flame Caster and Mystical lightening each a pendant with a note attached that after tomorrow it will all be explained to them the importance of the pendants. Mystical Caster turned to Lightening Caster as he held her tightly for they both knew what the pendants meant. Mystical Caster cried into her husband's chest.  That night after the party was over each of the original witches, warlocks all relived moments in their lives that meant the most to them. Mystical Shadow smiled "my fondest memories were all of Knight Shadow and our love we shared for each other." He took her hand kissing it.  "I will love you my sweetest dream beyond eternity." He said, as his eyes got a little misty.  They all went to bed to sleep before the last battle they were to fight ever again. That morning they all were in their warrior outfits, Natannie came into the room her face half white wolf and half woman she wore the outfit she wore the day they battled the demon who killed Ron, and Mystical Shadow had brought back to her.. Ron followed behind her dressed in the warrior's uniform of the White Light.  They divided into different sections each group would go into a different part of the world to battle the Dark Side. Mystical Shadow and Knight Shadow with their original ten warriors, Rain Caster, Enchantress Caster, Dream Caster, Destiny Shadow, Crystal Caster, Jada Caster, Coral Shadow, Mystical of Light. Were ready to go fight for the good and freedom from hell for the mortal's they had been protecting for years.  Natannie was surrounded by wolves, and Indian warrior's from different tribes along with their Chiefs, and medicine men that carried pouches full of their medicines to kill the evil they had to battle. The Furies were there to battle the evil mortals on earth.  Mystical Lightening, Flame Caster, their Parents Mystical Caster, Lightening Caster, Guardian Caster, Shadow Caster were all waiting to depart. Fire Caster arrived with the spiritual Warriors and now they would all depart in their directions to battle all over the world.  As all the warriors appeared in the skies the mortals looked in horror as they watched demons, and foul creatures appear in the sky as both sides faced each other in a line . The battle began when they heard the scream of the Banshee guided by the Miracle Child streaking through the skies over the earth. The demons and the warrior's threw lightening bolts, firebombs and potions, while the evil mortals were slewing the innocence in the streets, their homes and churches. The twins traveled from country to country destroying every evil demon, creature and evil mortal they came across, while Natannie and the tribal warriors killed thousands of the Dark side with their flaming bows and arrows soaked in the medicine men's potions. Mystical Shadow began to spin as if a massive tornado spraying the potion on the Dark Side Warrior's. Gore warrior's demon spirit looked at her with a smile. "Your time is up here." he said laughing and hit her with a huge lightening ball injuring her fatally. Falling to the ground she knew she was dying. A pack of wolves slowly surrounded her keeping evil away from her. Knight Shadow flew down to where she lay, taking her into his arms and holding her tightly. "Cheyenne." he said as tears filled his eyes. He knew that her life drained from her body. He softly ran his hand through her hair.  She looked up into his eyes with so much love and admiration. "I love you my sweet husband, don't mourn my death, but celebrate my new adventures in another world. "She told him as blood began to run from her mouth.  The wolves stood in a circle around them just as a lightening bolt struck Knight Shadow;  " Thank you." he said as he lay down beside Mystical Shadow holding her tightly as they life's were slipping away in each others arms. The wolves stood stead fast as red beams shot from their eyes killing the demons and anything else that was evil coming near the fallen High Priest and High Priestess.  "I told you that you couldn't get rid of me that easy." He told her kissing her.  She smiled weakly looking into his eyes. "Even in death we will be together, I wouldn't want to leave this world without you." She told him laying her head down on his shoulder. Tears rolled slowly down her face.  The other warriors saw the angel of death coming to collect Mystical Shadow and Knight Warrior, Mystic Caster saw her parents laying there on the side walk, she began screaming hysterically and blowing demons and evil that crossed her path into oblivion. She flew down to them crying. "Oh no, please don't leave me now." She cried as the wolves allowed her into the circle. "Mom, dad, I love you both with all of my heart." She said kissing them both good- bye. She cried kneeling next to the angel of death who wore a golden suit that matched his golden hair. A golden brilliant glow emulating him.  "It won't belong before I have to take them, you better call the others so they can say fare well to them. "He told her in a soft-spoken voice.  Mystic caster looked so lost. " No please don't take them." she pleaded to him.  "You need to call for the others." The Angel of death told her without any emotions.  When everyone gathered around them Natannie prayed a native prayer for them" For Tache Ushte and Tache Che ^^ Techihhila" she told them kissing them good-bye.  "What did you tell them?" Mystic Caster asked her.  "May the great spirit watch over you always." She told her as tears fell down her face watching her new friend let go of life. She felt like a sister to her in the short time span they had together.  Mystical Lightening and Flame caster arrived seeing their grand parents mortally wounded, they were so shaken up by it. Mystical Lightening tried to heal them with her tears.  The angel of death stopped her by grabbing her arm. "It is their time to go home now, your tears only heal those who the Higher Power has not called home to him." He told her seeing how devastated she was, she looked shocked realizing her special gift could not heal them.  Flame Caster took his grand mothers and grand fathers hands. Mystical Shadow told him.  " Never let the pendants leave you, finish our work here, do not allow our deaths to be in vain." She told him as a tear ran down her face.  "Grand mother." He said just as the other ten warriors were killed by the demons.  "Everyone is here now; it's time to go home." The angel of death told them as he rose from his kneeling position.  They watched their glittering soul's race to heaven with the Angel of death. The wolves howled their eerie sounding howl as the souls left each of the twelve original warrior's bodies.  Flame Caster & Mystical Lightening were so filled with grief that thousands of lightening bolts were striking everywhere in the world. killing the Dark side and evil of all kind, tornados crossed the world leveling buildings that were owned by the Dark side, a nuclear bomb more powerful then all of the governments nuclear technology destroyed all of the Dark sides caverns and dungeons. Nothing was left of what once had been the Dark side and the evil working for them.  All of the warriors went back to the palace where Charmelmystic met them.  "Your Grand parents are fine and so are their warriors." She told them smiling lovingly at everyone. "Mystical Lightening and Flame Caster are the High Priest and Priestess, everyone who fought in the war today may make this your permanent home and continue on working for the Higher Power." She told them, as her smile was so angelic looking.  "Why couldn't we see them one last time?" Mystic Caster asked as tears fell down her face. "I miss my mother so much, I need her to come back here, to our home. "She cried into Lightening casters chest. "Oh mama, please come back to me." she pleaded.  Charmelmystic looked at her grand daughter with such sadness. "They need this time to make the transitions, one day they will visit you." she told them, she knew the pain that Mystic Caster felt and it broke her heart. Knowing there wasn't anything else she could say or do; she blew them all a kiss and vanished into a golden sparkling mist.  It had been a year since the passing of the twelve warriors of the white light power; Flame Caster went to the lighthouse where his grand parents always went. He sat quietly as he watched the light house turning into the night. He kissed twelve roses and threw them into the water when he heard the sound of voices laughing, when he saw twelve sparkling energy balls chasing each other and vanishing into the night. He smiled knowing they had come to tell him they were happy. At that moment Ninja appeared next to him on the bench. "I know boy, one day we will all be reunited again." He said petting Ninja and then they disappeared the only thing left were three sparkling lights above the water. "Dumb dog, Let go of my pant leg Ralph!" Mystic shadow can be heard saying from time to time.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 25 by Erotica_Writings © Selena the witch of seduction would hunt out married men who normally would never think of betraying their wives, the thought of adultery was distasteful to them. She was out to destroy any true love since she was thrown away by a mortal man she fell in love with centuries ago. She was going to make all the mortal men pay dearly for her pain. Once she seduced him with her spell of lust she would make sure their wives discovered their affair, most of the time catching them in the act. Selena would make him become obsessed with her being oblivious to his wife, even when his wife caught him making illicit love to Selena he was blinded by the witches spell. She would arrange the killing of their wives so he had the guilt of destroying the only woman he had ever loved now forever gone, along with the spell she cast on him of lust. Left only with the knowledge of her death, the adultery he had committed. This would cause him to go totally insane. She was beautiful, she had long red hair, her eyes were blue, and she wore clothing that fit tight on her perfect hour glass figure revealing her large bust. She walked down the side walk hunting for a husband to destroy when she saw a husband and wife kissing each other good bye in front of a real estate office he worked at. Smiling for she could feel the love between them, she decided she needed a house. Walking inside wearing tight white pants, a white shirt that fit tight with a very low cut neck line revealing, with white spiked heals. Smiling she walked up to him noticing that his eyes was on her breast as her nipples could be seen under the shirt since she was braless.  Sounding very seductive touching his brown tie and smiling." I am interested in a really large house. Do you have a large one I might enjoy?" she asked smiling at him seductively her red lips looked wet.  "Yes, I do have a large one, a large house I mean that you might enjoy." He told her." we can go see it now if you like?" He asked her not being able to take his eyes off her body.  "Well then lets go." she told him smiling taking his arm into hers making it easier to glance down her top which he did feeling an urge coming over him.  Once in the car she leaned close to him as he was driving her breast rubbed against his arm, touching his leg with her hand and running her long red nails up his thigh making it quite known she was coming onto him. Inside the house she walked in front of him knowing he would not be able to help noticing how perfectly round her ass was. She walked next to him when faked tripping knowing he would grab her in his arms; she looked up at him casting her finale spell of seduction through her eyes.  He was tall with black hair, stocky built, he wore a cream color dress shirt, brown dress slacks and dark brown dress shoes, his eyes a light green. He moved his hand under her shirt yearning to touch her breast bringing her mouth up to his, he began kissing her passionately, and he never felt a kiss like this before. He slowly undressed her looking at her perfect body. He disrobed and took down to the floor as they pleasured each other with the fire growing inside of their bodies and her spell on him becoming stronger over him. Not once did his wife cross his mind while he was with this seductive witch. After they reached their climax of the lustful passion he laid there, the guilt started to take over his conscious for the betrayal to his one true love.  "We better go now." He said dressing quickly.  She smiled feeling his pain was just beginning." sure, when are we going to see each other again?" she asked him smiling.  "We're not." He told her avoiding her eyes.  "What you fuck me? And dump me?" she asked angrily.  "I am married to a wonderful woman! Hell I don't even know your name!" he yelled at her for being angry with him self for giving into cheap lust.  "Did you forget you were married when you put your hand under my shirt?!" she asked him yelling as if she was the innocent victim.  "I apologize for that. I have never been with another woman in twenty years except for my wife." He told her feeling bad now that she thought he used her.  "Well my name is Selena and you are?" she asked still acting like she had been used.  What could it hurt to tell her my name? He thought to himself. "I am John Phillips and I feel really bad about what just happened here between us." He told her hoping it would help her not to feel so bad.  "Oh I see I am not good enough. I suppose you have others who are!" she told him looking angry.  "There were never any others except for you." He told her trying to make her feel better, but it seemed anything he said just made it worse.  "Just take me back to the office please." She said making tears appear in her eyes making him feel even worse.  On the way back to the office she sat crying. Knowing he felt like the dirt she wanted him to feel like. "I am surprised you didn't ask me how much I charged!" she told him crying even harder.  "I didn't think you were a prostitute Selena. "He told her as he drove the car.  "Just a common whore that's all!" she said really playing the tear scene.  "I am so sorry for what I did to you." He said feeling guiltier.  As they were getting out of the car she looked at him." Just remember every time you fuck your wife she is fucking me too!" she told him walking down the side walk.  That night when his wife met him at home he felt guilty for having sex with Selena. When he kissed her hello it was different now that another woman's lips touched his, there wasn't that feeling he felt with Selena. That night as he lay in bed with his wife, Selena cast a spell for him to feel the lust again as he did earlier in the day as he remembered the wild passionate sex with her. He became aroused thinking of her large breast and the sweet taste of her hardened nipples as he slowly licked them hearing her low moans, the way her body moved on top of his. He started to kiss his wife thinking of Selena, he ran his hands over her body, but it was not like Selena's with large firm breast, Brenda had small breast. Closing his eyes he asked his wife to get on top of him recreating the sex with Selena moving in a circular slow motion teasing him until he was in the fantasy with Selena forgetting it was his wife that he exploded in such a powerful orgasm." Se-Lena! "He screamed out her name exploding in such a fiery passion.  His wife's eyes held the hurt and betrayal as he looked into them. She jumped off the bed.  " who the fuck is Selena?" she asked standing in the middle of the room naked as he looked at her small framed body, her short brown hair.  "No one my brown eyed girl." He told her trying to smile as he realized he really screwed it up this time.  "You called me Selena! Where did the name come from then?" she asked him as tears ran down her face.  "I said Brenda." He told her trying to cover the best he could.  "Are you trying to tell me I am crazy? That I imagined hearing you call me Selena?" she asked as she pulled on her jeans and sweat shirt.  "No baby, but I don't know a Selena." He lied knowing the truth would end their marriage of twenty years." please come back to bed, if I said it I don't know why I would say it." He lied again trying to get her calmed down  she looked at him suspiciously as she undressed putting her gown back on, she got back in bed turning her back to him falling a sleep. Selena crept into his dreams floating into the room in a long red sheer night gown, her hair flowing as she floated in caressing her breast, as he dreamed she masturbated calling his name." John, oh John." He dreamt her pulling back the covers as she began to give him oral sex. He could feel her moist mouth with those wet red lips on his hard organ as his hands were going through her long red hair , his body moving in his sleep, the orgasm felt so real, saying her name in his sleep as he exploded in a massive orgasm waking up calling out her name. He realized his wife had left.  after watching her husband dream of this Selena having sex with her , watching his body move, his hands moving as if they were running through her hair . She knew by his motions he must have been dreaming of her giving him oral sex. She got up quietly slipping out of the house, driving off in her car crying that her husband was being unfaithful to her. She checked into a motel room where he would not be able to find her.  John pulled on his pants to search the house for his wife finding her car gone, he knew she had left. He drove the streets searching for her but she wasn't at any of her friends or families house when he saw Selena walking down the street in a very short red dress with matching spiked heels, he came to a screeching stop, he felt anger towards her as he jumped out of the car he ran up to her grabbing her by both of her arms he began to yell at her." You're ruining my marriage! Why won't you leave me alone!" he yelled as he looked at her face full of fear.  "I haven't done anything! I was walking down the street minding my own business when you grabbed me!" she told him as he had her body pressed up against his.  "My wife left because I called out your name having sex with her thinking of you! Because I dreamt of you giving me oral sex." He said calming down realizing she must think he was crazy.  "So it's my fault that you seduced me in an empty house? It's my fault that you desired me and fantasized that it was me you were making love to? plus it is my fault that you dreamt of me giving you oral sex to pleasure, you?" she asked him as he was holding her tighter to his body his breathing becoming heavy with desire for her.  "I can't stop wanting you." He told her kissing her passionately running his hand under her dress finding she was not wearing anything under the dress. He licked her breast pushing her up against the car. "I want you damn it." He told her taking her right there up against the car as people drove by watching the sex show until he exploded inside of her. He could not get enough of her and he decided to take her to his house.  He carried her up stairs into the bed he shared with his wife making love to her caressing her breast as they moved together, she rolled him over. "Let me make your dream come true." she said going down on him until he called out her name so loud it could be heard through out the neighborhood. She continued to perform oral sex so she could make him become aroused again so she could ride him slowly feeling his hands over her entire body until they exploded together in a massive orgasm. Feeling she had him under her spell completely there was no returning from the hell she had created for him. she sat across his chest with her hand between her thighs moving her hips in a up and down motion pleasuring herself when he could no longer stand to watch it for she was driving his lust far out of control he pulled her closer pleasuring her with oral sex something he would never do with his wife. He made love to her the entire night until the sun came up.  "This is the kind of sex you only read about." he told her kissing her with his hand on the back of her head.  "I better go now." She told him kissing him good bye as she made sure she left enough of her long red hair around the house for his wife to find.  That night Brenda came home to find he was in bed where his thoughts were not of her, but of Selena, he was sexually aroused and wanting release of his sexual frustration. Brenda sat on the bed to talk to him when she saw the long red hair." I suppose this is my imagination too?" she asked angrily, but before she could get off the bed he had a dead grip on her arm.  He looked possessed as his eyes were glazed his teeth were clenched together as he spoke to her. "No it's not your fucking imagination! She was here all night pleasing me, something you have no knowledge of because you just lay there on your back! Well I want her again!" he told his wife ripping her clothes off of her, closing his eyes he thought of his beautiful Selena while he was raping his wife Brenda and calling her Selena. His kisses were passionate, his hands roaming her body as he became more violent." Suck me like Selena does!" he ordered her. He was half crazed out of his mind.  "No I will not!" she yelled at him struggling to get away from him.  John became enraged throwing her on her stomach raping her anally, not hearing his wife's screams, but only Selena's moans. "Selena I want you, I love you!" he cried as he had an orgasm.  Selena came walking into the room as John forced Brenda to stay as Selena joined them forcing the woman to watch her pleasure her husband orally as he held Brenda's wrist so she could not get away. She cried hysterically for she no longer knew her husband.  "I want your wife too." She said forcing her kisses on her mouth, this excited John even more watching her fondle his wife's breast, kissing and licking them. She made him force her to perform oral on her by beating her until she gave into his commands; he lay next to them touching Selena. Telling her how much he loved her and would do anything for her. They both raped her all night, her cries and pleads went UN heard by her husband as they were pleasuring themselves sadistically. He threw Brenda on the bed where he began raping her as he strangled her to death. Brenda laid dead in their bed, the spell of Selena was gone, as well as Selena. It was as if she never existed while his wife laid there bloodied from the brutal beating she received and the last words she heard spoken and took with her in death was I love you Selena. He had his wife's blood all over his naked body as he cried out a horrifying scream from what he had done to her. He literally went crazy sitting his wife up in the bed as if they were carrying on a conversation.  "I think we should both stay home from work today." He told his wife's corpse. "Good I am glad you agree with me." He told her kissing her bloodied and bruised mouth.  They remained in the house for two weeks, with him talking and cooking for his dead wife when the neighbors called the police from the odor coming from the house. They found his wife's body badly decomposed and John was fighting the police from removing her. He became so violent they had to shoot him when he grabbed one of the officer's guns killing him instantly.  Selena sat smiling as she sat in the park on a bench watching the happy couple who had been married for ten years, still in love with each other as the day they first met at the park jogging when he was looking behind him at another female who had just past him knocking her down on the ground as they collided for she was looking down at the ground, they have never been apart since that fateful day. He was a dark skinned African American; she was a light skinned African American mixed with Caucasian American. His pet name for her was brown sugar. Both were tall, he stood six foot two, weighing two hundred and sixty pounds of pure muscle. She was six feet tall weighing one hundred eighty five pounds her body muscle was toned, both were athletically built, her hair was a light brown, long and straight like her mothers. They both were wearing black sport shorts and white jogging shoes; he wore a white muscle shirt, while she wore a half white tank top. Selena changed into a pair of very short sport shorts, a red sports bra, with matching red jogging shoes. She began jogging behind them working her way up beside him.  "Hi I am Selena would you mind if I jog with you two some guys were bothering me." She asked noticing the first thing he looked at was her breast.  "Sure you can join us." His wife Alekka told her smiling so sweetly at her." I am Alekka and my husband Ken." She told her.  "Nice meeting you Alekka and Ken. Thank you for rescuing me." She said looking at Alekka first then smiling up at him with the start of the spell she had cast.  As they jogged Ken could not keep from sneaking looks at her breast as they bounced when she jogged, I'll bet they bounce during sex too. He thought to himself. What's wrong with me thinking like that about her? The more they ran the more he started envisioning her naked in front of him looking seductively massaging her breast. These were the visions she sent to him to see. Damn it I have to stop this before I get an erection! Scolding himself for his thoughts of Selena.  Alekka liked the woman for some strange reason." We are going to cook out at our house and swim in the pool your more then welcome to join us." She told her unaware of her husbands thoughts or the way he was looking at Selena.  "Sounds great to me." She smiled innocently as if she was unaware of the looks and thoughts he was having about her.  They gave her their address and phone number just in case she got lost going to their house. As the couple drove home he fantasized about her swimming in the pool naked getting an erection. Stop it man! He thought to himself. Once at their house they changed into their suits, his were a bright yellow matching her bikini when she suddenly remembered she had to go to the store for some food and drinks slipping a dress over her suit.  "I will be right back." She told him kissing him good bye.  As soon as Alekka left Selena rang the door bell to be greeted by Ken who looked at her standing in a white netted beach jacket she wore opened, a white one piece swim suit cut up high over her hips, the back had very little material revealing her rounded plump ass, the top had straps that snapped around her neck, cut into a v down to her navel exposing most of her large rounded breast. He felt himself getting aroused looking at her.  "Hello Ken, I think you're happy to see me." She said smiling looking at his pants seeing he was very much aroused. She walked past him and purposely touched his stomach softly with her hand.  Her touch made his desire rage for her as he walked up to her watching her remove her jacket seeing her hardened nipples through the suit. She looked at him hungrily with her eyes.  "Where is Alekka?" she asked as if she didn't already know.  "She went to the store for some things." He told her feeling like he was being pulled into her body by her eyes.  "I need something too Ken." She told him dropping her jacket to the floor; she approached him placing her hand in his trunks.  Before he knew what had happened he was on top of her on the floor ravishing her body, feeling sensations exploding with in his body as they rolled over kissing while she rode on top of him exploding into a maddening climax.  When Alekka came home they were sitting by the pool, she noticed her husband was touching her inner thigh. Putting down her bags she walked out to let them know she was home. "Hi, glad to see you could make it Selena." She said forcing a smile as her husband never looked at her once; he just kept looking at Selena.  "I am too that I made it here." She told her looking at Ken when she spoke.  "Well I am going to go start getting things ready. Ken would you help me?" she asked trying to get his attention.  "No, I will stay here with Selena to keep her company." He told his wife totally ignoring her.  She turned around fuming to go prepare the hamburgers for the cook out. When she looked out at them they were in the pool. She could not believe her eyes as he was behind her caressing her breast, her arms wrapped around his neck, their bodies were moving. She looked to see their suits on the ground. Dropping the meat on the floor feeling the tears burning her eyes she walked out to the pool grabbing the bowl of ice. Finding her husband having sex with this slut who invaded her house and her marriage.  "Oh you two will have to cook for your selves I am leaving. "She told them as they were next to edge of the pool totally oblivious to her; she dumped the ice over their heads which had started to melt." Thought you needed cooling off!" she yelled running from the pool area grabbing her keys to her car.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 25 by Erotica_Writings © The shock of the ice broke the spell that Selena had on Ken. "Oh my God what have I done?" he cried out as he tried getting out of the pool.  "I have not been satisfied yet." She grabbed him looking in his eyes casting her spell again, wrapping her arms around his neck kissing him.  "Oh please you're making me ill." A female's voice told them.  As the two in the pool looked up to see Jada caster in her warrior uniform standing with her hands on her hips. Standing next to her was Coral shadow. "Go save his wife before she goes over the cliff that this dumb bitch arranged." She told her then Coral shadow vanished.  "You're the dumb bitch! Do you know who I am?" she asked Jada caster.  "Yes, Selena the slut." She said dryly, she thought of the wolf witch who helped to kill Mystic Shadow." Well, I am Jada Caster, warrior of the white light and I am going to kick your ass!" she yelled looking at the man still kissing the back of her neck fondling her breast.  Jada caster lifted him from the pool while she froze the witch. Holding his body in mid air she chanted. " I Jada Caster sister Of Mystic Shadow reversing the spell cast on this man from the witch I am soon sending to hell!" she said reversing Salena's spell.  The man was still in the air looking down at Jada Caster. "Who are, what you are?" he asked seeing that he and Selena were naked.  "ok lets make this quick, I am the good witch, she is the bad witch, I am going to kick the shit out of her before sending her to hell, you were having sex with her. Your wife caught you ran out is about to go over a cliff and die." She told him.  He looked horrified by her words. "Die? Go save her!" he yelled still floating in the air.  Jada Caster sat him down on the ground slowly. "Already taking care of it stud, Coral shadow should be catching the car right now, setting it back on the ground. Now you stand here behind me so I can finish this before your wife gets back here, and put your clothes on." She told him looking down at him then smiling as she looked back up to face." Nice." She told him with a wink as he quickly pulled his pants on feeling the blood rush to his face from embarrassment.  Jada caster unfroze the wicked witch pulling her up out of the water with her powers she slammed her down on the ground hard and quick, Jada caster jumping through the air landed on her face with her boots. She beat the witch severely. She could see Mystic Shadow's face and body, when they returned her from being attacked. The angrier she got hot tears ran down her face as she used her martial arts to beat her to her a bloody pulp. Holding her up by the back of neck she looked at the man. "Find her hard to resist now?" she asked him full of rage then releasing the witch watching her falling to the ground." This is for you Mystic Shadow." She said blowing the witch up, it felt as if a nuclear bomb went off. Jada Caster fell to the ground on her knees holding her one hand over her mouth crying. "Mystic Shadow I miss you so much! I don't know if I can continue on without you!" she cried as the man stood still not knowing what to do for her.  The spirit warriors saw her pain over the loss of her fallen sister as they took the screaming witch to be delivered to hell. When they saw Mystic Shadow floating down to her. The man looked at the angel standing before them in the white glittering gown. "You will heal in time my beloved sister; I am still with you in the spirit world. Continue my battle against evil for it was evil that caused my destruction, don't let them win." She told Jada Caster who looked up at her through her tears of sorrow.  "I promise to continue your battle." she told Mystic Shadow who turned into sparkling gold lights as she vanished.  She looked at the man." You were a victim of evil, tomorrow when you and your wife awake everything will be back to normal. Next time you're tempted by evil cry out to God at that moment, instead of waiting for it to cause the damage as it has here today." She said getting up to her feet.  Suddenly there was a loud explosion with black smoke rising into the air.  The man cried out with the love in his heart for his wife. "Alekka!" he stood looking at the smoke, tears ran down his face.  "No God, take me instead for I was the weak one!" He cried as the pain of losing his wife cut through his heart like a knife.  Jada Caster put her hand on his shoulder knowing the pain he was feeling. "I know your pain my friend that is why it is important to live each day as our last; we never know when we might loose that special person or persons in our life." She told him as her tears ran down her face as she thought of the deceit she did to Mystic Shadow before her death.  Coral Shadow saw the woman's car driving recklessly all over the road then going over the cliff, she was able to freeze it in motion so she could get the woman out of the car. Coral shadow appeared at the car window. "Open the window and take my hand. Hurry! I can't hold the car much longer!" she yelled struggling to keep the car from falling.  The woman was so scared she did as she was told to do. Rolling down the window she grabbed Coral shadows hand when they vanished as the car plunged to the bottom bursting into a ball of fire. They stood on the edge of the cliff as the woman realized she could have been in there if this woman hadn't showed up.  "Are you an angel?" she asked looking at Coral Shadow.  "My name is Coral Shadow I am a witch, a warrior of the white light. We protect the innocents from evil. You broke the evil witch of seduction's spell by throwing the ice on them; it allowed your husband time to cry out to God before she put him under again." She tried to explain to the woman.  "Well how do we get rid of her?" Alekka asked scared of what this evil witch might do to her since Alekka knew she had to have put a spell on the car.  Coral shadow smiled taking her hand." It's safe to go back now, I am sure my sister Jada caster has taken care of her." She told her as they vanished.  They appeared back at the pool side where her husband sat on a patio chair crying into his hands. He looked up because he could smell Alekka's perfume, seeing his wife with Coral Shadow he smiled. "You're alright!" he yelled smiling running to his wife taking her into his arms." I am so sorry brown sugar." He told her crying.  Jada Caster looked at them knowing they truly loved each other." We are going to leave; when we are gone from here the memory of today will be gone. As a gift we are leaving you the knowledge of when evil is approaching so you will be able to ask for help before it is too late." She told them as she waved her hand over them and vanished.  "Oh wait a minute." Coral Shadow told Jada caster. She went back replacing a duplicate car of the woman's in the drive way smiling and she vanished.  Jada Caster with the help of the Furies placed a bounty on any shape shifter that was a witch transforming in to a wolf. With in less then a year with daily persistence upon her and the Furies there was not another witch living with the ability to change into a wolf to attack another mortal or supernatural being. This was their way of also honoring the High Priestess who treated them with respect and it was helping Jada Caster to over come her loss of her fallen sister. Murk caster was becoming more victorious over tracking down evil and destroying it in honor of his beloved wife who gave up her life to destroy evil.  The day had come for Mystic caster to give birth to her child. Mystic Shadow felt the contractions her daughter was having.  "The day has come for Mystic caster to give birth." She told Knight Shadow, Fire caster and Mystic of light. Knowing this was the day that the white light had been waiting for.  "I will make you a bet if it's a boy you have to go with me where ever I want for one day." Knight Shadow told her.  "I accept your bet, but if it's a girl you have to go where ever I want for the day." She told him smiling for she already knew the sex of Mystic caster's birth.  They showed up in the room where the birth was taking place, Mystic caster looked up to see her mother , uncle, grand father and Mystic of light for not only were they there to watch the birth to add protection for the dark side would try to locate Mystic caster to stop this day. Guardian caster also ordered every warrior to surround the room, Mystic Shadow did the same with the spirit warriors so nothing could get through to this room and then Murkcaster, Guardian caster, were to remove them to a secluded area.  Mystic Shadow looked at Murkcaster seeing how his grieving over her was wearing him down, knowing he had to remain a live for another twenty one years, realizing he could not go that long with out love or would be dead with in a year, she needed him to protect their daughter for she couldn't. Looking at Crystal caster she thought to herself. You will give my husband the love he needs and the wife I have chosen for him. Good bye my love its time for me to let you go so you may live. I do love you with all my heart. A tear dropped from her face landing on his heart.  Murkcaster looked at the tear drop then at his wife. He saw the look in her eye something was happening. When he heard the doctor say "we have a boy!" holding the boy up high so everyone could see the next High Priest.  "I won the bet." Knight Shadow told her.  "Wait something is wrong." She told him as her daughter began to scream again, everyone looked surprised even the doctor, except for Guardian caster and Mystic Shadow as they smiled at each other. Today the future High Priest and High Priestess were born. Mystic Shadow went to her grand mother explaining of the importance of Murkcaster staying alive and she had picked his next wife for him. Tears came to her eyes for she thought she would have been his only one love. Knowing what she had to do, she went to Murk caster's room. "We need to talk." She told him holding back her tears. "You must let me go completely, even from your heart. You must remain alive for twenty one years when our grandson would be of age to claim his throne." She told him seeing the confusion in his face.  "So why do I have to stop loving you? Why do I have to let you go?" he asked.  Not being able to hold back her tears." Because you're dying inside from your broken heart." She told him crying.  "I want to join you." He told her wishing he could just hold her and if he was dead he would be able to.  "No! Damn it for once it's not what you want! It must be done for our child and grand children." She told him.  "Why? Have you fell in love with Knight Shadow? He did conveniently die right after you!" He yelled at her.  "I warned you to stay away! I made you promise and you broke it! As with all the promises you ever made to me! I had a vision he would be killed trying to protect you from the death that he met instead!" she yelled knowing she would have to tell him what was not true." I don't love you anymore!" she yelled at him. Those words broke her heart. "Set me free please." She said crying for the pain in her eyes ripped her heart out.  "No, I will never love another woman or marry another woman." He told her refusing to let go of her for he intended to join her very soon as jealousy of Knight Shadow was consuming him.  "You haven't any choice in this matter for our grand children will be protected even if it costs me your love." She told him vanishing.  Standing on the other side of his door she cried, she did not want to let go of him. Her heart was breaking, this time she knew she was really gone from him, just as he was gone from her. Guardian caster stood there looking at her grand daughter taking her in her arms as she had the gift to touch and hold spirits.  "You did the right thing dear. I will start the union of Murkcaster and Crystal caster." She told her grand daughter knowing the thought of his up coming marriage was hurting her as much as it hurt Guardian caster to do. As soon as Mystic Shadow left Guardian caster performed the spell to begin the union that Mystic Shadow arranged to protect the children for Murkcaster was actually mourning him self to death.  Guardian caster thought back to when her daughter who gave birth to twins Mystic Shadow and her twin brother Flame caster, these were the two with their seven warriors and Flame casters second in command who were to destroy all evil as it was in the book for their powers together were powerful beyond belief, but the dark side sent a demon who killed Flame caster as he slept in his crib. Charmelmystic came in the room in time to blow the demon up before he could kill her daughter Mystic Shadow, that was when they decided for the protection of the children they were to be placed into an adoption agency. They took the secret of the children's location even from the High Council with them to their graves.  Mystic caster named the girl after her mother Mystic Shadow, her son she named Flame caster UN aware of the twin brother of her mother. Destiny would not be stopped for it was written for the destruction of evil to take place and it would not be stopped.  Murkcaster and Crystal Shadow started to become infatuated with each other as they stayed at the Mansion of Fire caster in Madrid with Guardian caster, and twenty of the warriors who were to guard the children with their life. Guardian Caster watched as the romance blossomed.  Murkcaster and Crystal shadow were swimming in the pool wrestling around when he looked into her eyes kissing her passionately, he ran his hands over her body. They took their suits off making passionate love for hours. He carried her upstairs to his bedroom where they continued they love making until dawn.  Murkcaster looking lovingly at her touching her face softly." I want to know will you marry me?" he asked her feeling so much love for her.  Crystal caster looked at him. "Oh yes, I will marry you." She told him for she felt the same love for him.  Guardian caster broke the news that they were going to marry. Mystic Shadow looked at her grand mother as tears filled her eyes. "Even though it is what I wanted, that I arranged. It doesn't make the pain any less." She cried in to her hands.  "I know child, you have had to make great sacrifices in your life and even in death you are still making sacrifices. It is time that you too find love now. I know of a man who truly loves you dear and you have never stopped loving him, maybe you did not love him as much as Murkcaster for you gave him the gift of life." She told her.  "We're dead so what is the point?" she asked her grandmother.  "Just because you are dead does not mean you can not live and love. Remember you are special spirits with powers." She told her kissing her good bye before she returned to the mansion.  Mystic Shadow sat there thinking of their conversation when she went to the mansion seeing with her own eyes of the love between Murkcaster and Crystal Shadow with out being noticed. Seeing them together happy she was able to get the closure she needed.  Mystic Shadow summoned Knight Shadow to a deserted beach where she had torches burning, a beach house with a fire place burning. She wore a long seductive blue gown fitting tight to her body, a v neck line that showed her cleavage, her hair was up as she wore diamond earrings. He looked around wondering what was going on when he walked inside seeing her standing there looking so beautiful when he noticed he was now wearing a black tuxedo.  "What is going on?" he asked her bewildered by all of this.  Mystic Shadow walked up to him wrapping her arms around his neck. "I love you, I have never stopped loving you, and I was running from you." She told him as she started the song from Bread singing it to him by using her powers to create the music to play all their love songs  "Baby I am through running its true I'd be a fool to try to escape you when maybe I am beat but oh what a sweet surrender. You keep your rights I'll take your nights. No one can lose when we turn the lights out I'm tasting defeat, loving that sweet surrender I 'm giving all of myself to you, but I didn't really lose at all." before she could finish singing the song to him he kissed her passionately spinning them around from the joy and love he had been missing coming back to him.  He looked down at her standing still looking into her eyes as the love songs from Bread continued to play." I love you with all my heart, it belongs to you completely. I want to marry you even in death." He told her as he carried her to the bedroom where they made love to each other rekindling a love that was destined to be even in death.  The next morning they summoned Guardian caster to them. "Has something happened?" she asked looking around at the beach house smiling for she knew they had reunited.  "Yes something has happened; I want to marry your grand daughter even if we are dead." He told her holding Mystic Shadow in his arms.  "I told you Mystic Shadow you're a special kind of spirit who can still live and love." She said smiling at the two. "It was written that you two were to marry, but of course evil put its nasty hand in it breaking you two up. When she met Murkcaster she fell in love with him of course we could not break it up or we would have been like evil, so they continued even though she could not shut her heart to you, you realized after she had married the mistake you made by letting her go without fighting for her. There was no way for us to change it." She told them seeing the love between them." Murkcaster loved her this is true, but it was not a real love, a real love there is no hurt, jealousy, it is not cruel, but is forgiving. He would throw things up at her in fights, things that she had no control over; he'd call her nasty names because of work having her to do certain things. When she was pregnant you questioned her how? Believed what she told you and stood by her side. He only came back because he did not want you having her. When we all thought she died from the fall it was you who told the heavens you did not want to live without her. You have always been there supporting her in any decisions she has made, defending her against those who wished her harm. Even though Mystic caster is not your daughter you gave up your life for her because she had just lost one parent you couldn't allow her to lose another. Why did you chose to let him live instead of you? For the love for her mother." she told them as they listened to her knowing it was all true.  Mystic Shadow looking at her grand mother suspiciously." Why was it written in the book to marry a mortal since I am a witch?" she asked watching her face.  "You were not to marry a mortal, but a warlock who was a mighty warrior who would have been second in command should anything happen to your brother, he would become the High Priest." She said with tears in her eyes.  "My brother?" she asked shocked. "What happened to him?" Mystic shadow asked her grand mother.  "Your brother was killed by a demon in his crib, which was when all the children were placed in an adoption agency." She told her sadly, "Your true soul mate has been waiting patiently to be united with his bride." she told smiling as tears sparkled in her eyes. "He and his brother was placed into the adoption agency, he grew up fell in love and will marry his intended Bride tonight taking his rightful place back as High Priest." She told them smiling.  They looked at each other then back at Guardian caster. Knight Shadow was shocked to hear the news. "why didn't I know? Why didn't I get my powers when you found us?" he asked feeling confused. "where is my brother?" he asked never knowing he had a brother.  "He has always been your partner." She told him as she continued to tell them what had happened to them "Because evil changed what was to be it prevented your powers by breaking your true loves heart, which caused the break up. Everything goes back to how it was suppose to be when you wed tonight at mid night. I will take the powers of Mystic caster's mother and real father to protect her and her children."

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 24 by Erotica_Writings © The warriors monitor the Furies on their large television screen.  Greg Standish a forty year old male with a college degree spent most of his time in and out of prison for robbery to support his drug habit. He had a wife and family at home, but the weekends he spent with his friends, he met while serving time in prison.   Frank Harding a thirty four year old male, who makes his money selling drugs to adults and teenagers, he is an abusive husband and father to his wife and their three small daughters, their ages are three years old, four years old and five years old. All the girls resembled their mother. Thin, long brown hair and brown eyes.  Tim Engel a twenty four year old male, who works in a grocery store, he is single and living with his mother. He spent four years for the rape of a thirteen year old girl  Mathew Tillinger a thirty six year old male, engaged to be married in two months, he owns a small lawn service business which most of his money goes to Frank for drugs. Spending most of his time in prison on drug possession charges.  Paul Kendall an eighteen years old male, unemployed makes his money selling drugs for Frank, lives with his older sister and her husband. Was sentenced to prison as an adult at the age of fourteen for the brutal beating and stabbing of his teacher who was six months pregnant. It was by the grace of God they both survived.  The men all looked similar in appearance, tall, thin muscular built, their hair shaved close to their heads, tattoos that supported the white supremacist. They all wore white T shirts, blue jeans with black belts and black army boots. Their only difference was their eye color which was either blue or brown.  As they sat drinking and shooting heroine into their veins, the more they shot up the more they laughed at all the people running for their lives.  “To bad for the ones who didn’t get away.” Greg said laughing.  ” That one Japanese guy, he flew up in the air when I shot him!” he boasted as the others were laughing at the poor mans demise.  Six months had gone by, they were still killing, and not being caught, it became a game to them.  The three furies who avenged the deaths of innocents or family members gone unpunished take revenge on the criminals or a family member who was guilty of the crime. Their faces were pretty; they wore black and white paint on one side of their faces in the shapes of a star, half moon and a pentagram. Their bodies were perfect with wings coming from their backs; they wore a plan brown strapless mid thigh dress and brown slave sandals. Their hair was long brown dread locks and snakes wrapping around their bodies. Their bounty was the five men who had killed eighty people on their so called hunts and now they were going to be the hunted.  They stood silently at the foot of the bed of Greg Standish sleeping soundly next to his wife as the three furies planted the victims they killed in his dream. Greg was running from the victims down a long dark road their blood was squirting out of their bodies covering him, their screams of agony were loud and penetrating his ears . He woke his wife up screaming for them to stop! He held his ears sitting up in bed in a cold sweat from his night of terror.  “Tell who to stop?” she asked her husband.  “Them!” he yelled looking around the room seeing they were alone in their bedroom. His heart was pounding wildly. “I was dreaming.” He told her realizing he actually had worked up a sweat as if he had actually been running. Every time he fell to sleep he would dream the same dream over and over for a week straight. It got to the point he was too frightened to fall a sleep. When no one was home with him, the Furies would appear before him pointing at him. He thought he was hallucinating, he ran from the house as the Furies looked at each other smiling. Their work would soon be over, the first task was to drive their prey to insanity, and he was almost there. He began to avoid his friends as guilt began to consume his conscious. He was walking in the woods when he began to hear the screams again getting louder as if they were coming from behind him, he turned to look behind him when he saw the three Furies walking and pointing at him, the look on their faces were intense. The victims that the men killed were behind the three Furies screaming and pointing at him. He began running through the woods screaming as they chased him, he was unable to get away from them until he stopped at the edge of a cliff with a hundred foot drop, looking back at the Furies and the victims they killed and then back at the cliff. He chose death. The only ones standing at the cliff were the Furies looking down smiling at the dead mans body smashed on the rocks. His soul was taken away screaming by the spirit warriors of the white light to be delivered to the Grim Reaper where he would burn in hell for eternity. The Furies were successful in their hunt, and now they were off to catch their second one.  That night they appeared in the room of Frank Harding who had past out from all the drugs and alcohol after beating his wife and daughters so severely the children lay in their beds as their mother tried to sooth them. She feared they would wake the bastard up in the next room.” Please babies, I know it hurts, but we have to be quiet or he’ll wake up.” Their mother whispered fearing for their lives as much as she fought him back when attacking the children. He would hurt them worse if awakened.  “Why can’t he just leave us alone when we leave? Instead of making us come back home!” the five year old cried.  The furies over hearing their conversation would make this hunt more intense for they were also going to avenge his family for the abuse he put them through.  Frank lay sleeping, his daughters and wife was opening the door pointing at him.” Make him leave us alone!” they pleaded as he saw the victims they killed entering his room screaming at him so loud the glass in the house was shattering as they walked closer to him they began to beat him as their blood spurted out of their bodies covering his . He woke up screaming realizing he had been dreaming as he looked around the room; it was the same as it was when he had gone to bed. Rubbing his stubble hair he laid back down to have the same dream over and over each time he fell back to sleep. Once again, for a solid week he was afraid to go to sleep just as his friend had been before his death. He looked away when his family came into the same room as he was in, he would quickly depart the area. The three Furies stood before him pointing at him; he was the only one who saw the Furies. The screaming of his victims he could hear in his head getting louder and louder. He held his head; the screams were so loud it felt like his head would blow up! He ran out of the house screaming, his wife and children thought he had gone totally insane. He ran down the side walk seeing the Furies, his family and victims chasing him, pointing at him, he turned into an ally where a gang was standing waiting to rob someone.  They grabbed him beating him with bats and chains. He watched the Furies, his family and the victims standing and pointing with such intensity in their faces, the victims screams of agony getting louder, he scrambled to his feet looking around at all the people in the ally, he saw one of the members with a gun. He grabbed the gun sticking it in his mouth blowing his brains out. The gang members ran from the ally and the Furies stood over their victorious hunt. They watched the spirit warriors of the white light delivering another one of the five men souls to the Grim Reaper where they would burn for eternity side by side.  That night they stood at the foot of the bed of Tim Engel’s, he was dreaming of his ten year old neighbor. In his dream, he was raping and torturing her. His dream became filled with all the victims they had killed, chasing him through the store he worked in, screaming out from the agony of their deaths, the faster he ran the closer they got to him. They were grabbing at his clothes, cutting his flesh with their nails, he was screaming in fear of his life. People shopping in the store were oblivious to him as he begged for their help. The victim’s screams got louder and louder, the people stood around laughing and pointing at him being tormented and tortured. He ran out of the store down a sidewalk he became trapped by a brick wall that appeared from nowhere. The victims pounced on him dragging him down to the ground and their piercing screams busted out all of the surrounding storefront windows. Waking up in a sweat, his heart was beating so hard, he thought it would come out of his chest. He felt his back burning; when he reached around with his hand he felt a warm thick fluid on it. He went to bathroom where he saw the blood seeping from gashes in his back. Scared he looked around his room seeing nothing or no one. He sat up on his bed all night awake scared to go back to sleep. The next day he began to hear their screams in his head as he worked. He looked around to see if they were coming, but he saw nothing. That night he fell to sleep thinking he got the scratches from his bed some how. Once he had fallen into a deep sleep the dream started again, and ending the same way, only this time his gashes were across his chest. He sat rocking back and forth on the bed crying, holding his pillow trying to block the voices out of his head.  The next morning he showed his mother the cuts on his body, she did not see anything there, only he did. The voices were back screaming in his head. He could not stand it. He saw the three Furies standing beside his mother as she cooked breakfast pointing at him. “Look don’t you see those creatures standing next to you?” he asked frightened.  “There is no one here, just us Tim; you haven’t any wounds on your body.” She told him in a calm voice. She feared he was suffering from a mental break down.” Sit down and eat your breakfast like a good boy.” By the end of the week he was totally insane. He sat in his living room listening to the screams. He would sit and just cry holding his ears to try to drown out the sounds that were driving him crazy. He saw the three Furies and the victims coming for him, he ran to the bathroom locking him inside. He heard them banging on the door, he coward in the corner hiding his face and head with his arms. He heard the door breaking away. He feared what they would do to do him he grabbed the sharp edge razor slitting his jugular vein. Before he died, he only saw the three Furies smiling down at him and that the door had never been broken in, then he saw darkness. His soul was taken away screaming by the spirit warriors of the white light and delivered to the Grim Reaper, joining his friends to burn in hell.  That night they went to their fourth preys house, Paul Kendall high on acid, he looked at the three Furies trying to attack them with a knife, they brought in his victims screaming at him, he was yelling and swinging his knife at them, he woke up his sister and brother in law who saw nothing in his room. The Furies kept him in this state of mind to quicken the kill. By the third day, he left running out of the house, screaming to the top of his voice as he was being pursued by the Furies and his victims to an eighteen-story building. He ran to the roof crying, he looked down at the street below and back at the Furies and victim pointing at him, he cried the anguish that his victims and their families felt. He jumped to his death right in the path of an eighteen-wheeler. The Furies watched as his soul was taken away like his other friends.  Mathew Tillinger knew there was more to his friend’s deaths then just committing suicide and whatever got them wasn’t getting him. He left to go to the cabin where he’d be safe since no one knew about it. He sat alone in the cabin drinking his bottle of whiskey, he envisioned his friends sitting there looking as they did at their deaths, Frank with his brains blown out, Greg whose face was smashed in from hitting the rocks, Tim with his throat slashed and blood gushing out, Paul’s whose face was half torn off and one of his arms dangling. They all sat around laughing as they did the first night of the killings. Except for Mathew he knew he could not escape from whatever killed his friends.  “You’re not getting me!” he yelled when he saw the three Furies pointing at him. “You’re not real! Fucking get out of here!” he yelled hearing the screams of agony from the victims and the only ones who left were his mangled friends. “Stop the screaming!” he yelled. It got louder and louder as he tried to drown them out. He took six sleeping pills to make him fall a sleep to escape them, but all this did was trap him from waking up as the Furies, and the victims were chasing him along with his friends through the woods. They were telling him it was his turn to pay as they did. All night he heard the deafening screams, running and running, but always ending up back in the cabin standing in front of all of them.” Nooooo!” he yelled as the pills wore off of him. He began to come out of the sleep, but the voices of his friends demanding that he join them in hell, the victims screaming in agony and the Furies standing in front of him pointing. He ran out of the cabin to his car jumping in it and leaving. The faster he drove the louder the voices and screams got, he looked in his rear view the creatures pointing at him were gone. He turned the music up to drown out the voices and screams in his head, but they drowned out the music. He felt as if his head would explode any second from the throbbing. “Stop it! Please!” he yelled and suddenly it became quiet. He drove the rest of the day and night until he had to pull over to sleep.  He was back at the cabin, the voices and screaming it was starting all over again! He woke up to silence in the cabin; he had to escape from here before they came back. He ran to his car driving out on to the high way when he saw three sets of feet hanging down from the hood of the car. The creatures were on top of his car now. The voices and the screaming began to start all over again. He floored the gas paddle as the car was swerving all over the road when he looked in the rear view mirror and in the back seat were the Furies pointing at him! “No! You’re not getting me!” he cried out as fear filled his body. The voices and screams kept getting louder and louder in his head.” Make it stop!” he cried out as he was losing his mind. The Furies remained in the back seat pointing at him, his driving becoming more erratic when he saw all the victims and his four friends standing in the road walking towards the car, the car swerved going over the cliff bursting into flames as the Furies watched standing at the top of the cliff smiling as his struggling soul trying to escape the spirit warriors who led him away screaming. They were taking him to be reunited with his friends where they all were screaming from burning from the flames of hell.  There weren’t any words spoken between Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster the next morning after she spent the day at the carnival with Knight Shadow, Murkcaster left to go work out without even a good bye. Rain caster came to her.” There is news of a port hole to another world that the demons are using to come through.” He told her.  “Where is it? I will go check it out. ” She told him.  “You hardly look like a demon; if they catch you they will destroy you.” He told her.  Mystic Shadow transformed her look having long black hair, a tight fitting long black dress, slit to her hips, a plunging neck line that hardly covered her breast, black spike heels, her eyes lined in thick black liner, her lips silver lips lined in black, her skin was so white it looked gray with long black nails that curled.  “Now that is scary looking.” He told her as she looked pure evil.  “Take me to the entrance.” She told him as her voice had even changed to pure demonic.  He took her to the port hole worried about her being alone. They were UN aware that it closes in two hours where she would be stuck inside of the other world for twenty four hours when the port hole would open back up. Stepping inside she realized it was a town that the demons had taken over. She was back in the eighteen hundreds. She walked along the side walks where the demons were raping the women, witches and warlocks torturing the towns people when a very large demon, his skin was red and scaly, his eyes glowed yellow, his ears resembled wings, horns protruding from his head. His arms were long with long yellow finger nails.  “You have never been here before, who are you with?” he asked in a demonic voice  Smiling seductively at him “I am Feora, I was told to come here to seek shelter from the warriors of the white light.” She told him as she looked his body over.” You are quite a large demon.” she told him smiling as she touched his chest and stomach lightly with her long black nails.  The demon looked at her body as he was falling into her seductive trick to make him believe she was evil. He ran his large claw like hand over her breast.” Come with me to pleasure me if you are truly who you say are.” He told her as he leaned over running his snake like tongue over her lips and breast.  She was dreading him touching her, but she wanted to stay alive until she could get back to bring the warriors in to destroy these demons torturing these mortal. They went inside of a large house where she saw female witches mating with demons and the warlocks were pleasuring themselves with the female demons, when they past one room she saw a witch giving birth.  “She is giving birth?” she asked.  “Yes to a hybrid half demon and witch.” He told her. “We will be more powerful in winning our war. Both of their powers combined together.  “Wonderful.” She told him smiling as they entered a room realizing how powerful Alex would have been if she too had been evil.  “The human women do they give birth as well?” she asked as trying to prolong the inevitable.  “yes, but those are the weaker demons, I don’t wish to discuss this , instead I wish to do this!” he told her as he ripped her clothes off throwing her on the bed and attacking her first as a test, evil would thrive on it.  When he reached his pleasure he began licking her with his reptile tongue, she could feel he was still hard, he licked her breast then laying on his back she straddled him, only he had her sit on his chest so he could watch when he orally pleasured her to make sure she was not faking it, a true evil witch would not. She began to feel pleasure as he was causing her to become aroused, finding herself desiring him. Moving her body down she took him inside of her moving slowly until she reached her climax, her eyes began to glow. Mating with this demon made the scar on her hand began to burn. It glowed as Gore warrior’s evil blood was taking over her, the witch that turned into a wolf its attack on her infected her with its evil blood through the bites and cuts she received. She had turned into Feora, her memory of Mystic Shadow was gone and the Queen of Darkness born.  The witch who was in labor earlier delivered her child, the infant was taken away from her by a warlock who would take the infant to an adoption agency to be adopted by mortals. Hundreds of these infants had been adopted to unsuspecting parents. Making the dark sides attack and possessions quicker with the white light warriors unaware of these half demons, witch or warlock infants being adopted all over the world. She left the room with the demon still lying in the bed. She began to stalk the streets looking for a mortal to attack when she saw a male mortal who was built, he was young, black hair, blue eyes, he walked fast down the road to avoid being grabbed to impregnate another repulsive demon when she grabbed him by the throat forcing her tongue in his mouth and pushing him into a dark alley shoving him against the wall. She placed his hands on her ass.” You want me?” she asked licking his neck placing her hand down his pants.  ‘We’re not aloud to have sex with you, only the female demons.” He told her as her hand was making him aroused, giving into the lust he was feeling for her. Even with her evil look having sex with her was better then some horrific looking demon. She removed their clothing with a blink of her eyes, he laid on the ground as she rode him hard giving him pleasures he never had experienced before. Her eyes began to glow as she climaxed, fangs growing from her teeth, she opened her mouth sinking her teeth into his neck.  He looked at her as she began to suck his blood.” Oh no.” he said as it made his orgasm more intense. Realizing he was not dead from her bite.” I didn’t die.” He told her surprised as he looked at her glowing yellow eyes.  “You’re my slave to pleasure me, you will become as I am, you’ll always be searching for blood.” She told him licking the blood off of his neck.” I am a powerful witch, with demon and werewolf blood flowing through my veins.” She told him.  Three male demons came upon them.” That is forbidden! You have broken the master rules!” They yelled grabbing Feora by the arms. This infuriated her that they put their hands on her, she sent them flying into the wall, her powers were more powerful then that of Mystic Shadow, the demons blew up as soon as they made contact with the wall. Her and her slave Richard walked though the town, her eyes glowing brightly, strong winds blowing all around her as she blew up every demon, witch, and warlock, sucking the blood and killing the mortals in the town. She hated everything, wanting to destroy any thing living evil or good. Walking to the port hole after her massacre of everything in the town she became more infuriated that it was sealed closed, using her powers she blew it open with her powers. They grew more powerful as each minute ticked by. Feora walked out seeing the warriors of the white light on the other side trying to get in.  “Mystic shadow what happened?” Rain caster asked her realizing she had become beyond demonic.  The winds were blowing worse then any hurricane known to man kind. Feora laughed.” I am Feora! Not that worthless witch Mystic Shadow!” she yelled as she tossed all the warriors flying through the air like they were toys.  Mystic caster was the only one still standing as Feora’s powers did not effect her, she began to glow a brilliant white light sending Feora flying into the air at the same time blowing her slave into pieces. Knight shadow, Murk caster all of the warriors watched the battle between Mystic caster and Feora. Mystic caster reflecting Feora’s lightening bolts, fire balls,  ” You better give me your best, because you’re just pissing me off now!” Mystic caster told her, the same words that the warriors heard from Mystic Shadow so often in battle.  Feora threw a large dagger at Mystic caster surprising Feora when she caught it between her teeth.” Like my mother I am good with my mouth.” She smiled tauntingly at Feora.” I warned you to give your best; now you've bored me with your tired ass!” Mystic caster shouted at the evil being  Throwing her so hard up against a tree it knocked Feora out which gave Mystic Shadow time to emerged from Feora.” I love you all remember that, but you have to kill her to free my soul from the evil flowing through my veins. Gore warrior mixed his blood into mine and the were wolf attack, coming here amongst evil brought the evil to life.” She told her daughter with tears running down her face.” Please baby, don’t make me live like this! I beg of you it is everything I have ever battled and I can not become one, I am growing weak she is returning. I love you my sweet child.” she told her as tears fell down her face.  “No mother, please! Don’t ask me to kill you, we can destroy her not you, can’t we?” She asked crying as her heart broke into tiny pieces knowing she would have to kill her beloved mother. There was no other way since Feora was taking over Mystic Shadow completely.  All of the warriors stood watching with tears running down their face. Murk caster looking at her with the pain cutting through his heart like a dagger knowing that the time was nearing for him and his beloved wife to have to part. “Mystic Shadow please let us help you. Don’t leave me! I don’t know what to do without you! You’re my life!” He cried out in pain.  Knight shadow falling to his knees realizing she was lost to him forever; there was not a prayer that would save her. ”Good bye my love.” He whispered with tears spilling from his eyes like a crystal blue lake...  She smiled through her tears.” I love you Murk caster. Good bye Knight Shadow, I’ll always love you in death.” She said as Feora took over again lifting her hand to kill the daughter of Mystic Shadow.  Mystic caster angry that her mother was not protected from Gore warrior and that witch wolf thing, she just looked at Feora blowing her up before Feora was able to do anything. Mystic Shadow’s soul glowed white and sparkled as she was set free soaring up to the heavens.  Mystic caster fell to the ground crying for the woman inside of the cruel witch was her beloved mother, best friend and now she was lost forever to her. Her body rocking back and forth on her knees crying.  “Oh God I killed my mother! Why didn’t you protect her?! Why did you make me be the one to take her life?! Oh mother come back please!” she cried out to the heavens  Murkcaster helped his daughter to her feet as she cried so hard.  “Mother I love you so much! Please forgive me!” she cried to the heavens.  Her father holding her as he cried.” It was her wish, she knew you were stronger then any power Feora had.” He told her trying to except her death for she was the only woman he ever loved.  Rain caster helped Knight Shadow to his feet.” Come on she is gone now.” He cried for he too would miss his old friend.  Back at the palace Guardian caster knew her beloved grand daughter was gone. Remembering their moments together.” Why did you take her away from us?” she asked the heavens as her tears fell from her eyes.  Mystic caster sat in her room for days until it was time for her mother’s memorial service. It was beautiful the way they set it up the candles around her pictures, fairies floating around them sprinkling their magical dust.  Murkcaster the High Priest stood in the middle of the room with Mystic caster his daughter the new High Priestess. “My father and I find it hard to speak, our pain is so great.” She said crying looking at her mother’s pictures.” So we found a song that my mother loved from many years ago that we feel is appropriate, it says how we all feel about her death. A group called Bread recorded this song entitled you left me just when I needed you most.” She said as the tears flowed from her eyes she cried harder into her hands.  Knight shadow knowing the song well, it was one she’d listen to often. He cried into his hands not wanting to except she was gone forever. The six witches were lost with out her. They listened to the words of the song; it expressed so well their pain over her loss. Their tears falling like soft rain drops. Jada Caster felt the worse for the way she had betrayed her just before the end of her life. At the end of the song Mystic of light appeared with Mystic shadow’s father Fire Caster.” I mystic of light and Fire caster would not be where we are at today if it had not been for my fallen sister and High Priestess Mystic Shadow. We have come to ask the High Power to grant us our request to return her soul to us to rule the spirits of the white light as she did in life right to her death which was UN just.” She said as the two held hands when a brilliant light glowed so bright with sparkles actually flying from it, in the middle of it was Mystic Shadow in a long white glittering gown, white sparkling shoes, her hair up in curls on top of her head. A diamond band that sparkled brightly around her fore head, her hands stretched straight out from her body, she was absolutely beautiful. Murk caster looked at his wife as tears were running down his face, Mystic caster smiled with tears in her eyes, for it was her rightful place to remain High Priestess in the spirit world for she gave up her life for the white light trying to fight evil up to the very end. “I want to present Mystic Shadow to all the warriors of the white light, not just to the spirit warriors our High Priestess Mystic Shadow who even in spirit is the High Priestess of us all and my mother.” Mystic caster told the room.” I will be here only in body for she will still guide me to guide you.” She said smiling looking up at her mother.  Mystic Shadow came floating down to them on the floor.” Thank you, all of you for your love for me; I will continue to help guide you through Mystic caster. She told her warriors turning to Murk caster. “Go on with your life my love, love again, I am dead and cannot be your wife as I have been. Just because I am still a warrior in the spirit world don’t stop your life. Mystic caster’s child that she will one day have will be the next High priestess and I will guide her as well. “She told them smiling.  Murk caster looked at his wife lovingly.” like Knight Shadow, there is no other woman who can fill my heart after loving you, we both will wait to join our love when join the spirit warriors of the white light.” He told her looking at Knight Shadow and smiling.  Knight Shadow smiled.” Thank you.” He said with tears in his eyes for Murk caster recognizing his love for her.  “Knight Shadow you whispered good bye to me that night, never good bye my love, I will be waiting for both of my loves to rejoin me.” She said smiling at both of the men as Mystic of light, Fire caster took Mystic Shadow home.  A week had gone by since Mystic Shadow went to live with the spirit warriors of the white light, the six witches felt the loneliness of life without her being around. They sat in the parlor of the palace reminiscing of the days when they first met, how even when they all were kidnap she tried to protect Jada caster.  Jada caster began to cry.” God I can not forgive myself for being so envious of her, the things I did to her. I almost caused her to be raped, because I pretended to be her. God! I am so loss with out her!” she cried.  A white light appeared in the room with the women. Mystic Shadow stood in front of her.” I forgave you before you ever did anything to me Jada caster. When you truly love someone it is easy to forgive.” She smiled at them all. "now you all must listen carefully to what I have to tell you, while in that town of demons they were hybrid witches with male demons warlocks with female demons, and creating a lower form of demons. The off springs were taken to adoption agencies across the world, there were hundreds of infants adopted, and you have to tell the others and search for those demonic beings and destroy them."  The women quickly went to Mystic caster to tell her of the news her mother brought when she came to let Jada caster know she was forgiven.  Murk caster sat in his room feeling guilty that the day before she died they had fought and he had lost her trust as he held the diamond ruby necklace in his hand that he and coral caster had been searching for as they tried to keep her birthday gift a secret. “If I had only told you what I was doing your trust would never have been broken.” He said crying looking at the necklace.  “You just did tell me.” she said standing behind him smiling.” Why do you not give it to our daughter since I am unable to wear it, I think it will sooth her.” She told him as she began to look serious.  “The warriors will be going to battle soon, I do not want you going for a lot of warriors will be lost and I don’t think our daughter could handle losing both of her parents so soon.” She told him.  “Alright I will stay behind to protect her, I love you Mystic Shadow.” He told her as she vanished.  He took the necklace to Mystic caster as Mystics  Shadow requested.  “I bought this for you’re mother for her birthday, but she asked me to give it to you.” he told her placing it on her neck.  “She has visited everyone to forgive them for what they did to her, why hasn’t she came to visit me?” she asked  “You did nothing to clear up Mystic caster.” He told her holding her as she cried.  “My sweet daughter you saved me, you did not murder me. I came here to thank you; it took a lot of courage to do what you did.” Mystic Shadow told her daughter. “Wear the necklace for it was bought out of love.” She told her vanishing.  The warriors were sent out to check on all the adopted children going back as far as possible since hundreds were delivered to the adoption agencies. They found one who was three years old; while his mother lay sleeping he stabbed her a hundred times. When the warriors found him he was in a state mental institution where they vanquished him wiping out all paper work on him. The warriors task was made simple since it was always the same warlock using the same name and he was able to escape the town the night Feora destroyed everything. Most of the adoptions were in their twenties by now. The warlock arranged for one hundred of them to set a trap where they would destroy the white light warriors for vanquishing the demonic children. They had succeeded in vanquishing fifty demonic children so far.  As the warriors were in an abandoned ware house, the address they were given of an adopted child they were met by the warlock with his flock of one hundred demons. Knight Shadow, Rain caster, the six female witches were there. Mystic Shadow received information on the trap telling Mystic caster to send out over one hundred warriors to save them. Murk caster had to break his promise wearing a pendulant to protect him. When they arrived the warlock spotted Murk caster knowing he was the High Priest sending a huge lightening bolt his way, Murk caster did not see it coming he was battling another demon with his back to the warlock. Knight shadow saw what the warlock did as he vanquished him at the same time he flew in front of the lightening bolt saving Murk caster. None of the other warriors saw Knight Shadow get hit until they had vanquished all the other demons, the warriors losing twenty five of their own. Rain caster went to his partner as he saw he was dying.  ” Oh man why you?” Rain caster asked him holding him in his arms.  Knight Shadow looked up at him weakly, “It was meant for Murk caster, I couldn’t have Mystic caster left with out both parents.” He said as death was looming closer.” I’ll see you on the other side buddy.” He said smiling taken his last breath.  “Officer down.” Rain Caster said silently as tears fell for his best friend, partner in the police force. “Oh God why?” he asked holding his friend tightly in his arms.  Murk caster heard how he died saving his life for Mystic caster.” Damn it! If I had stayed away he’d be alive now.” He said crying as he actually did like Knight Shadow.  Murk caster ordered a royal burial that High Priest gets for his fallen warrior. They took his body to prepare it for the ceremony of Knight Shadow which would be held first, and then the twenty five warriors who died were to follow right after.  His body was laid out in a glass case the fairies were sprinkling their magical dust over him. Murk caster stood next to Mystic caster who cried over the loss of her” Uncle Rodger” as she always had called him.  “ I Murk caster High Priest and Mystic caster High Priestess are here tonight to pay our respect to a fallen officer who spent many years in law enforcement fighting evil and continued on here with us as he was one of our brave warriors who will be missed by all of us. Mystic caster and myself request to the High Power that this brave warrior be sent be with the High Priestess Mystic Shadow to be by her side, working with her High officers Mystic of light and Fire caster for Knight Shadow is a royal warrior.” He said as tears fell from the warriors of the white light.  A bright light began to glow as his soul rose out of his body to be greeted by Mystic Shadow; Mystic of light and Fire caster as the four of them flew around the room then vanished. Murk caster and Mystic caster walked to where the twenty five warriors who were laid out in a glass casing, they asked the Higher Power for them to be placed with the spirit warriors of the white light when a huge bright light glowed as the twenty five souls rose from their bodies to be received by twenty five spirit warriors. They flew around the room in an arrow formation then vanished.  That night Murk caster ordered a full blown war on any kind of evil that existed. He was avenging the deaths of his beloved wife, Knight shadow who without an ounce of hesitation took the lightening bolt that was meant for him and the twenty five brave warriors so that evil could not weaken the warriors of the white light losing both the High Priestess and the second in command so close together.  “Why did you break your promise to me Murk caster?” Mystic  Shadow asked appearing in front of him in his bedroom.  “I know you were right, I just didn’t realize it would cost him his life.” He said truly hurt by what his actions had caused. “How is he adjusting?”  “ as well as can be expected, even though you can see us, talk to us, no one can touch us as they once could when we were in the flesh. Mystic caster must go through with her wedding as planned. Do not let our deaths stop it. Promise me! and this time keep it Murk caster!” she told him in a stern voice.” I have to go now.” She told him blowing him a kiss as she left.  It took Murk caster and the warriors five months to destroy the demon children who been unleashed on to the mortals, he sought to fight harder then ever since it took Mystic  Shadow from him.    Six months later  The day had come for Mystic caster and Lightening caster to be married, in honor of her mother she wore the dress her mother wore on the day she too married. The wedding was held in the manor, Jada caster and the six witches wore the same dresses as they did on Mystic Shadow’s wedding. Mystic caster had recreated the whole wedding except Rain caster replaced Knight Shadow for Lightening caster. Her father being the High Priest held the ceremony joining the couple together. Mystic Shadow had tears of Joy in her eyes as she watched her little girl be joined in Holy Union with Lightening caster as she stood next to Knight Shadow who tried to hide the tears watching the beautiful woman he had watch grow up still calling him uncle Roger and defying the rules as her mother did. After the couple were joined together in Holy Union they danced their first married dance together. They sat at the thrones smiling happily at everyone; Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow were granted five minutes to be solid so they could hug Mystic caster on her wedding night. She cried in her mothers arms.  “I have missed you so much mother.” She told her touching her face. She hugged her uncle Roger.” I miss you too uncle Roger and I feel better knowing that you are with her, because you truly do love her.” She told him kissing him on his cheek. Murk caster had the chance to hug and kiss his wife before she had to leave and to shake Knight Shadows hand for saving his life. Then they vanished.  That night Mystic caster conceived just as her mother had on her wedding night.  Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow sat up on the top of a cliff over looking the ocean as the full moons light made the water look as if it were sparkling, they sat silently taking in the peacefulness of its radiating beauty, Knowing that the conception had taken place between Mystic caster and Lightening caster .  “I bet she has a boy.” He told her looking at how beautiful she was even as a spirit. He gently touched her face with his finger tips. “You will be a beautiful grandmother.” he told her looking at how she looked so radiant in the white sparkling gown.  She looked at him smiling.” and you will be a handsome great uncle.” She told him realizing he was very handsome in the white suit.  Grabbing his heart.” oh! That sounds older then grand mother.” He said laughing then kissing her softly on her lips.  She did not say a word to him after the kiss he gave her; she just stared back into his eyes.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 23 by Erotica_Writings © Jada Crystal cast a spell so no one could read her thoughts and the ones they did read were the ones that she implanted so no one would know what she was up to. As she entered, the room to work out she noticed no one was around, she summoned Doom caster a massive black warrior who was bald, his build was muscular, and his body hard and firm. She transformed herself into looking like Mystic Shadow looking at the huge man when he came into the room. She would not only cause trouble for Mystic Shadow, but also have fun at the same time. She walked up to him smiling. "I was wondering if you would work out with me?" she asked him looking at his body in the new white work out suits.  "I would be honored." he told her smiling.  I think we should try wresting moves." she told him as he would have to be in contact with each others bodies.  She allowed him to pin her down on the floor; he was on top of her becoming aroused looking at her breast. While he had her down, she was able to maneuver her body so she was sitting on top of him. Holding his arms back over his head leaning over him as her breast touched his face. She moved her body feeling him getting an erection then kissing him softly. He returned her kisses, she allowed him to touch her breast, and she sat straight up on top of him moving her body sexually with her eyes closed.  "Take me now." She told him through her powers they both were nude, he entered her thinking it was with Mystic Shadow.  After they had reached their climax she smiled for he never suspected it was not Mystic Shadow." You can go now." She told him as they both dressed.  He looked at her strangely. "Will I see you again?" he asked taking her hand kissing it softly.  She smiled at him smugly. "Don't be ridiculous. " She told him and vanished.  That night while everyone was sleeping, she slipped into Roger's room as he slept soundly; sitting on the edge of the bed, she woke him. "Knight Shadow." She whispered into his ear.  When he woke up he saw her sitting there in a white satin night gown with a white satin lacing criss crossing from her breast to her navel." is something wrong?" he asked as he looked at her, she was so beautiful he thought.  "I couldn't sleep." she told him leaning over kissing him.  By her kiss, he knew it was not Mystic Shadow, but that it was actually Jada caster.  "Well now that you woke me up I can't either." he told her taking her in his arms, kissing her passionately, he had never kissed Jada caster with so much feeling and love. His hands roamed over her body, he took her with such force, such passion. "I love you Mystic Shadow." He whispered in her ear. Then he became rougher, violent in the bed  She began to feel scared. "Stop your hurting me!" she yelled as he continued the assault.  He looked her in the eye." That is how cheap vile whores like it!" he yelled at her.  She looked at him in shock when the door opened and Mystic Shadow stood there in disbelief with Murkcaster, " what is going on in here?" she asked as she heard the yelling and her own voice coming from the room.  Knight Shadow grabbed his robe as he quickly jumped out of the bed." You have a Judas!" He told Mystic Shadow causing Jada caster's spell to break revealing her identity to them.  Mystic Shadow looked at her confused, hurt without saying a word tears fell down her face. She felt her heart break by the hurt caused by the woman she thought of as a sister. She ran down the hall to her bedroom throwing her self on the bed. She cried over the loss of her sister.  Murkcaster knew she was in pain and made Jada caster feel Mystic Shadow's pain, he let her see her crying the tears of sorrow on her bed.  Jada Caster holding her finger tips over her mouth with tears filling her eyes like pools. "Oh God what have I done?" she cried realizing that she had created something in her head that did not exist. "May I please go to her?" she asked Murkcaster.  "No, you have done enough damage for now." he told her walking away.  Guardian caster appeared." come with me child, we must cleanse your body, and soul of the evil you allowed to enter it, her name is called envy." She told her.  "I have to tell her I am sorry." She told Guardian caster crying.  They decided it was best to keep this all a secret from the others and hope the month of cleansing, oils, healing potions would restore Jada caster.  The next day Mystic Shadow was working out when Doom caster came in while she was there. Looking at her body, he remembered how her body made him feel and he wanted her again.  "Want company today?" he asked lusting over her body.  "No thank you I am finished." She told him getting up and leaving.  He became angered feeling used "now I am not even good enough for her royal highness to talk to!" he said to himself throwing punches at the wall." I have plans for you!" he said looking at the door angrily.  He cast a spell that the next time they were alone she would become unconscious so he could kidnap her." I'll teach you!" he said a loud.  The next day he waited until he saw her enter the work out room he followed her in when she saw him behind her she fainted into his arms and they disappeared.  He took her to an abandoned castle keeping her in the dungeon he used a potion that rendered her powers useless. She was chained to a bed where he woke her as they both lay in the bed." I woke you because I want you awake when I take what you gave to me willingly yesterday." He told her touching her body.  "That wasn't me! It was Jada caster! She was caught last night and sent for cleansing." she told him trying to use her powers, but they were gone. "Oh God help me please." She cried as he forced her to kiss him.  Suddenly the wall of the dungeon exploded with Mystic caster standing there in her warrior's uniform. "She told you it was not her! She was telling the truth! "She told him slamming him into the wall across the room." You might have disabled her powers, but you did not disable me!" she said shooting fireballs at him. " the reason I am being so hard on you, the fact that a warrior of the white light would never Kidnap and try to rape another warrior, especially the High Priestess when she turns you down for anything!" she said sending electrical shock waves through him.  He began screaming as the electricity out lined his body in a blue light, his body was shaking from electrical currents flowing through it.  Mystic caster filled with anger looked at the man with contempt. "I Mystic caster, daughter of Mystic Shadow order this dishonorable warrior of the white light be sent to the one that eats evil souls!" she said as she through a white ball full of lightening at him causing him to blow up. She clothed her mother after unchaining her and taking her home.  When they arrived at the hospital she was met by everyone except for Murkcaster.  "Where is Murkcaster?" she asked looking around.  "He left early this morning with Coral shadow, we have not seen or heard from them since." Rain caster told her" I tried locating them when Mystic caster had her vision of you're kidnapping when we were walking through the garden."  Mystic Shadow wondered where he could be. She waited for hours trying to track him by spells, telepathic messages, but nothing. Finally at midnight he showed up. "Where have you been?" she asked him. She had been worried about him, envisioning horrible things all night.  "We were tracking down an evil spirit." He told her as he started getting ready to go to bed.  "Why didn't you answer my telepathic message?" she asked.  "I didn't get any." He told her as he sat on the side of the bed.  "Why did you have everyone tuned out?" she asked him getting irritated.  "No why?" he asked.  "Did you catch the evil spirit?" she asked  "It got away." He told her. "Why?" he asked her wondering why all the questions.  "Well let's see, I was kidnapped, almost raped and it was our daughter who came to my rescue!" she told him as the anger flashed through her eyes.  "What?" he asked shocked that this all happened. He could tell she was pist off.  "I hope you had fun chasing your spirit while I was held hostage by Doom caster!" she sat turning her back to him.  "I will check in more often I promise." He told her.  Mystic Shadow cried from despair of his almost lack of concern for her safety.  A month had gone by before Jada caster was released; Mystic Shadow went to get her. She cried in Mystic Shadow's arms when she realized the envy she had gotten could have cost Mystic Shadow her life.  "I am so sorry.' she told her crying.  "It's alright, you're cleansed and healed. Now let's go home." She told her smiling holding her chin in the palm of her hand.  Returning back to the palace Murkcaster and Coral shadow were gone again. They finally returned hours later. Mystic Shadow was past worried this time, she was purely pist off and through with the whole thing. No man would ever make a fool of her again.  "Chasing spirits?" she asked sitting in their room.  "Yes." He told her.  "No contacting me again?" she asked fuming.  "I tried, but then we just got caught up in chasing the spirit. I forgot." He told her.  "Fuck you! Fuck your bullshit! You could have made contact if you had wanted to, but you did not! Just like you're promised!" she yelled at him.  "I swear I am telling the truth." He said.  "No, here is the truth! Do what you want, when you want, with whomever you want! Because I will be!" she told him feeling the trust that he had earned back from her after the incident with the entity was gone. She would never be coming back to him. Two strikes your out as far as she was concerned.  The next morning she got out of bed with out waking him, dressed in her blue jeans that fit tight, she put on a white half top with spaghetti strings criss crossing in the front over her shoulders and back, she put on a pair of white sneakers. Walking out of the room she ran into Knight Shadow.  "Where are you going?" he asked her.  Mystic Shadow looked at him in the white suit and smiled at him as she changed him into blue jeans, a white shirt and sneakers. "We're going to a carnival!" she said grabbing his hand as they vanished.  They appeared at the carnival something she always loved as a kid.  " Remember I am Cheyenne and you're Roger." She told him.  "I will try not to forget who we are." He said smiling remembering the times they spent at the fairs.  She grabbed his hand as she pulled him to the round up; they had to stand up while it went around and around so fast, the gravity held them in the ride. She was laughing as her hair flew all around her face and into the air.  When they got off the ride they were laughing, then she saw a ride that looked like a huge boat swinging back and forth in the air. They were off on to that ride. She would sit with her arms up when they were in the up position and laughing as the swung back and forth. Next was the bumper cars, she was a speed demon hitting everyone who got in her way.  "Wiped you out on that one buddy." She told him punching him in the arm lightly since he never hit her once with his car.  "You never were a good driver; you were always running down something." He told her jokingly.  "Funny aren't we?" she said smiling. "ooh I want a hot dog!" she told him running to the hot dog stand. They ate the hot dogs chasing it down with soda. "There is nothing better then a hot dog from a carnival." She said as she was chewing and talking with her mouth full like a little kid.  The next ride they went on was a cage, they sat in it and it began spinning them, going up & down side to side. When they got off she ran to the side of a building getting sick while he laughed at her.  "Want a nice greasy hamburger now?" he asked making her sick again.  "Oh please shut up will you?" she asked leaning on the wall. "Let's see if we can still shoot," she said dragging him to the game where she won him a small teddy bear smiling with the pride she felt.  "Let me try now." He told her taking the riffle winning her the largest bear they had.  "Show off." She told him sticking out her tongue.  They sat on a bench under a tree listening to the birds, acting like normal people instead of the witch and warlock they were. They stayed and closed out the carnival at midnight. Looking sad as the lights were going out, the rides were stopped and people were leaving.  "Ready to go back to who we really are?" she asked him.  "You haven't spoken of your husband all day, something wrong?" he asked her.  "No he seems to go chasing spirits all day and night with Coral caster. It has happened twice and never catching their spirit. So I guess we did the same thing and lost ours," she told him just as they heard gunfire being shot at the people leaving; everyone began ducking down so they would not be shot.  "Oh my God a little girl was shot!" she said seeing her vision as she ended up next to the parents.  The little girl was crying Mystic Shadow laid her hands on her as Roger could no longer see the car. She removed the bullet with her magic then healed her. "She is alright" she said handing her to her mother who was crying.  "An angel a real angel." She said holding her four-year-old daughter with blond hair, and blue eyes. She looked just like her mother as Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow vanished.  Unknown to Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow the carload of five men killed ten people that night on their shooting rampage. The five men high on drugs and alcohol decided to make people their hunt, killing whoever got in the way of their bullets. They shot from the high-powered riffles they carried to do their deadly deed.  Murkcaster was angry when they returned to the palace seeing the teddy bears they each held.  "Have fun? Couldn't let me know where you were?" he asked through clinched teeth.  "We were chasing spirits and they got away." She said sarcastically kissing Knight Shadow good night on his cheek." Thank you for the great day." She told him going into her room.  "Stay away from my wife." Murkcaster told him.  Knight Shadow looked at him very coldly.  "Well I am willing to battle you for her if you want too?" he told him.  "Asshole! " Murkcaster said then stormed into the room slamming the door Shut.  Knight Shadow laughed as he went to his room feeling on top of the world after spending the day with Mystic Shadow. He went to bed that night with a smile on his face.  Mystic Shadow pretended to be a sleep when he came to bed cussing under his breath about Knight Shadow.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 22 by Erotica_Writings © The warriors were monitoring the ferocious windigo and its latest prey a young child named Sandy. They had to attack it at just the right time or they could cost the child its life.  Kaitlin a thirty year old woman who was stocky built, brown hair with blue eyes, she lived with her seventy six year old mother Molly who kept her hair dyed black. Molly was short and thin, with green eyes, in her younger days she was quite a gold digger. Dating men married or not, as long as they gave her the riches she desired. She felt not one ounce of guilt leaving Kaitlin, her older brother and sister home where they would have to eat mashed potatoes with ketchup for dinner while she dined in the finest of restaurants. Before Kaitlin had to move in with her mother Molly who had married her sixth husband Victor, he was twenty years her senior when she was sixty six years old thinking he was well off since he worked for the Swedish government. When she had used up his life savings taking lavish trips abroad, he became ill and bed ridden after their third year of marriage, she would attack him by pulling his hair while he lay in a fetal position screaming at him to die! His cruel wife tortured the old man for a year before she finally caused him to have a stroke by her constant attacks on him. This angered his wife Molly that he did not die from it. Kaitlin came to the house to visit him finding her mother and sister Wanda standing over him, Kaitlin knew by his mouth being drawn he had suffered a stroke.  "he has had a stroke aren't you going to take him to the hospital?" she asked looking at the man laying in his bed, even though Kaitlin and him did not see eye to eye on things she did not like seeing a human being suffering.  "No there is nothing they can do for him." her mother replied drinking a glass of wine.  Kaitlin could not believe they were just going to let him lay there. She left feeling disgusted. As she could never get her mothers approval, she was always accusing her of stealing from her, telling her she wasn't any good and no one could ever live with her. She hounded Kaitlin causing her to turn to drugs and alcohol at twenty years old, but even after she had clean herself up from the drugs and alcohol, she became an executive in a law firm, her mother still accused her of doing drugs. When she stood up to her mother and did not bow down to her wishes. Kaitlin was always broke from the woman taking her money. Her mother had the rest of Kaitlin's family attacking her with false accusations and finally Kaitlin gave into her mother, just to shut her up. When Victor finally died escaping the hell he had to live with Molly, Kaitlin moved in with her mother because it was to much paying her own bills, much less her mothers. Her mother being the unappreciative bitch that she was made her life a living hell telling everyone how Wanda who looked just like Molly was the good one. Wanda never came around if she could avoid it, her brother Joe dropped out of sight twenty years ago because he hated his mother. She always tried to make Kaitlin to look like a looser, that Kaitlin was cruel to her, trying to push her around. Kaitlin would pray at night to be freed from this hell she had to live in. Kaitlin came home from work one day finding a woman who was of medium build, red hair, brown eyes holding a new born infant sitting in her house ." Kaitlin I met this poor soul at the dough nut shop, they had no where to go, I told her we would help her. She can't work because she needs to take care of the child and that I would support them," her mother told her looking so sweetly at the woman.  Kaitlin turned to go to her room rolling her eyes." You mean I will support them!" she said under her breath not wanting a confrontation with her mother again. In her room she would sit at her desk with her head in her hands questioning her sanity. A month had gone by with the new dependants thrust upon her. She sat in her bedroom listening to her mother screaming at the young mother Paula over her child Sandy, forcing Paula to give her the baby to hold when she knew she was trying to put her to bed. One night as Kaitlin sat in her bedroom she heard her mother yelling at the girl again.  "You are unappreciative, I support and feed you, gave you a roof over your head and you treat me like shit!" she yelled at the girl.  Kaitlin had enough with her berating this woman, not allowing her to do, as she should with her child. Kaitlin walked out of the room, the girl looked shocked for she saw Kaitlin was angry.  "This is not your child mother! And I am the one who feeds them, buy her diapers and all you did was to give them a place in your torture chamber of fucking hell!" she yelled in defense of the girl who was crying from her mothers abuse.  "I will slap you in your mouth you keep talking to me like that little girl." She yelled as she turned charging at Kaitlin.  Kaitlin stood still with a look so intense on her face." You don't want to lay a hand on me; I promise you will regret it." Kaitlin told her in a calm voice.  "You're on drugs! I will find out who is giving it to you and someone is going to be in trouble!" she yelled at Kaitlin.  "Kiss my ass! That is always your answer to everything that I am doing drugs! "She yelled back at her mother.  "Well look at how your acting!?" she screamed at Kaitlin. "You get out of my house right now!" she yelled.  "Fuck you mother, I paid the bills here this week. Call the law and have them put me out you crazy old woman!" She yelled at her. Kaitlin turned around going back to her room knowing that the girl would not be yelled at anymore that her mother would make her an ally, bad mouthing her terrible daughter. "Fuck you." She said as she closed her door. "I hate her, why can't you just die you old bitch so I can be free of you!" she said to herself sitting in her prison cell as she referred to her bedroom  After six months Kaitlin noticed just how nervous the girl was becoming." Where is the wicked witch of the west?" she asked the girl.  "She went out." She told her." She fought with me all day, I was glad when she left." Paula told her with a look of relief.  Kaitlin smiled." I know the feeling." She told her going into her room.  That night the baby had began to cry for five minutes when her mother was screaming at Paula that she was hurting the baby, probably sticking her with pins. Molly ripped the child from her arms. She had actually gotten the baby to only want her by spoiling her because in her sick mind she wanted the child to love her and not its mother. Kaitlin sat at her desk, her head in her hands with her eyes closed praying for her mother to just shut up. Later in the evening after Paula got the baby to bed Kaitlin heard her mother sneak into the room while Paula sat out side smoking a cigarette. She heard the baby screaming as if something scared or hurt it. Her mother barged into her room yelling at Kaitlin." This baby has been crying for hours and you have not done anything for her, but to let her lay in that room crying!" her mothers face was evil looking as she held the baby.' I know sweet heart I am the only one who loves you." She told the baby kissing its cheek as she patted her back.  "That baby was sleeping and has not been crying for hours. You went in there and did something to her." She told her mother.  "I did not! You better stop lying on me and I mean it!" she screamed at her." I am the only one with a heart in this house! None of you care for this little angel but me!" She said as Paula stood behind her.  " Where were you at out screwing some man while your baby has been crying for hours!?" she yelled at Paula.  "You're really nuts! You're really fucking nuts!" Kaitlin yelled." All the girl was doing was sitting outside smoking a cigarette." She told her.  "You better shut up, if you know what is good for you! You will burn in hell for how you treat me!" she yelled.  "Shut up you self righteous hypocrite!" Kaitlin yelled back.  Her mother handed Paula the baby slapping Kaitlin across the face as hard as she could. Kaitlin stood up grabbing her mother by the arms, her teeth clenched.  "You ever lay your hands on me and I will break every fucking bone in your body!" she told her pushing her mother out of her room. Her mother started to run back in when Kaitlin turned looking at her with a look that scared her mother; she backed slowly out of the room.  Kaitlin went back to her room shutting the door." I hate you!" she said to her self.  Paula knocked on the door "Hey she left." She told her through the door.  "Good maybe the boogie man will get her." She told Paula as they both laughed.  As Molly walked through the dark alley she did not see the ten foot tall demon called a Windigo standing in the dark, its head was huge with large fangs, the mouth was twisted, and the eyes were beady. It attacked Molly viciously, biting into her flesh and ripping her apart.  Kaitlin looked at the clock it was eleven o'clock." Pout you old bitch I am not coming to look for you." she said going to bed.  Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster saw the attack in a vision as they saw the Windigo transformed into Molly and going back to the house knowing the baby was there. They preyed especially on children. Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster appeared in the room where the baby and her mother were sleeping.  "I feel evil had lived in this house." Mystic Shadow whispered not wanting to awaken the child. She woke Paula up." Don't be frighten we are here to save you." She told her.  "Save me? Did Kaitlin send for you?" she asked her.  "Who's Kaitlin?" she asked.  "She's the daughter of the mean old woman Molly. So who sent you?" she asked.  "Quick go to Kaitlin with your child!" She told the girl feeling the demon was at the house.  She grabbed her child running out of the room where she saw Molly coming into the door of the living room.  Paula ran into Kaitlin's room slamming the door behind her scaring Kaitlin who was sound a sleep." What's wrong?" she asked.  Before Paula could say anything Molly smashed through the closed door. "Oh my God!" Paula yelled jumping on the bed with Kaitlin where both women and the child were screaming.  Kaitlin saw Mystic Shadow grab Molly and threw her into the wall with her powers.  "Do not look into her eyes!" Mystic caster yelled at the women knowing the demon could give one look that could scare them to death. Using her powers she smashed it into the wall of the living room not wanting to be bitten by it or it could transform again. The witches battled the beast with their powers when the other ten witches and warlocks appeared using all of their powers, they blew it up as Mystic Shadow sent it straight to the one who eats the evil souls.  Kaitlin and Paula stood looking at the people in their living room." I knew she was an evil old woman, but I didn't think she was that mean that it took twelve of you to take her out." She said looking surprised.  "That was not your mother; it was a Windigo, an evil demon." Knight shadow told them.  "My mother was a demon in life as much as she tortured us." Kaitlin told them. "She won't come back will her?" She asked standing there with her arms crossed with a blank stare in her eyes.  "No, in fact she was sent to hell by Mystic of the Light." Mystic caster told them then they all vanished.  Kaitlin had a smile on her face for the first time in a long time. That morning the women woke up to file a missing person report since they had no memory of the night before. To this day Molly has never been found.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 21 by Erotica_Writings © Warriors, witches, warlocks of the White Light from every corner of the world all showed up at the castle for the engagement party of Mystic caster and Lightening caster, the seven witches and Mystic Shadow picked the largest room in the castle turning it into the ball room. Fredrick hardly ever came to it when he was alive so it normally just sat abandoned. Everyone looked so elegant in their gowns and jewels. The happy couple waltzed most of the evening.  Murk caster stood before everyone getting their attention.  “I am proud to announce the official engagement of Mystic caster and Lightening caster.” He announced over a micro phone.  Everyone applauded the happy couple even Fredrick who was accompanied by a very pretty blond who was killed in a plane crash.  Once everyone returned home they were informed of a witch who seduced men to their death’s by transforming into a were wolf. She would choose men who were homely with low self-esteems. The warriors with Mystic Shadow watched from a large screen television as Brandy began her game of hunt for her prey.  Brandy a beautiful red head, her body in perfect shape, she had large rounded breast and wore tight fitting clothes showing her cleavage guaranteeing a successful hunt. She visited a bar in New York wearing a tight low cut black dress, black spiked heels. She quickly spotted a man who was obese watching all the women; walking up to him she stood very close to him so he would have to look at her cleavage. She placed her hand on his arm.  “Excuse me is this seat taken?” She asked him smiling up at him.  “Please sit down.” he said looking right at her cleavage.  “Thank you.” she said as she purposely had her breast graze his arm.  “Can I buy you a drink?” he asked looking her body up and down.  “Yes thank you.” She told him smiling as she turned slightly towards him crossing her legs.” why is a handsome man as your self here all alone?” she asked him looking seductively. This won’t take long he probably hasn’t had a woman in years. She thought to her self.  “Women aren’t interested in me.” He told her as he felt her hand rubbing his thigh.  “I Am.” she told him leaning closer to him, she placed her hand on the back of his neck bringing his face closer to hers and kissed him.  ” would you dance with me? I am sorry, what is your name?” she asked rubbing his thigh and moving her hand up higher knowing he was becoming aroused.  “Fred and I’d love to dance with you.” He told her imagining her in bed with him.  He held her close as she wrapped her arms around his neck letting him touch her, caressing her ass. ”would you take me home?” she asked him looking seductive. “By the way I am Brandy you can drink me all night long.” She said licking her lips sensually and very slowly.  He hurried to get her back to his place, she teased him in the taxi rubbing his crotch and smiling at the cab driver looking in the mirror at her. She began blowing him kisses. He is a nice chunky size man she thought to herself of the cab driver looking seductively at him. I love dark meat too, she thought to herself smiling.  Once up stares she removed her clothes helping him to remove his. “Brandy needs to be filled up by Fred, she’s on empty.” She told him pushing him back on the bed and straddling him as he entered her. She moved her hips slowly.” I just want to feast on your body.” She told him as she got excited thinking about it with her eyes closed.  He thought he was sexually satisfying her as turned on as she was getting, not realizing she was getting turned on from thinking of the feast she would soon have. She was oblivious to him touching her breast or even having sex with her, she was getting into eating him. She began to move faster and wilder, he was so into the sex that he did not notice when she began to growl, her nails began to grow. She began to grow more hair on her body and face. The closer she was to climaxing the closer he was to being dinner. They both exploded into climaxes, she turned completely into a were wolf, killing him before he could scream out in terror when he saw the creature she had become. She ripped his body apart eating it until she was full. Turning back into the witch she showered there washing away his blood on her body. She took her time dressing since there wasn’t any screaming. She left the apartment walking down the street when the cab driver showed up.  “Need a ride? It’s on me.” He said smiling.  Brandy looked at the man smiling, tomorrow nights dinner she thought to herself. “Thank you I would love that.” She told him as she sat in front with him.  He looked at her body; he wanted to drive her hard.” What are you doing tonight?” he asked her hoping to take her home with him.  Smiling at him, ok breakfast she thought to her self. “Whatever you are doing tonight and in the morning.” she told him sliding across the seat feeling his arousal.” I love thick dark meat.” She told him licking his neck.  “Damn I can’t wait to get you home!” he told her as he was getting so turned on by her. Once at his house she began removing her clothes before they even got to the bedroom, she undressed him pushing him down on the bed.” Ride me mama!” he told her as she sat on top of him enjoying the sexual gratification now that she had been fed he was safe for the night.  After they had sexually satisfied each other she had heart burn.” Do you have anything for heart burn?’ she asked him.  “Sure do let me go get it.” He told her. “Ate something that didn’t agree with you?” he asked her coming back to the bed.  “Yes to much fat has that effect on me.” She told him smiling.  Brandy slept soundly in his bed with a full belly and being sexually satisfied by the man she would have for breakfast the next morning.  The eight witches could not get anything on this witch wolf, not that she would be any trouble to vanquish since her only powers were to transform into a were wolf , hunt her victims to kill, evidently she did not cause them any fear for Mystic Shadow to receive any type of visions.  Tammy and Margaret were whispering about Tammy and Rogers fling last night.” is he getting over her yet?” Margaret asked Tammy.  “No, and I don’t think he ever will.” She told her shooting a quick glance at Cheyenne.  .” Damn it!” She said to herself aloud,” I am going to find her if it is the last thing I do!” she told the women as she fumed. “Ok Cheyenne think like the detective that you once were. Tammy find out where the victim was last seen last night.” She told her as she stood in the middle of the room in her blue jeans, a long white T shirt, with just a pair of white socks, her long brown hair pulled up on her head held with a clip. Her finger nail was between her clinched teeth.  Tammy jumped when Cheyenne spoke thinking she had seen her glance at her. “I am on my way to New York.” She told her vanishing.  It wasn’t long before she returned. “ok, he was last seen leaving the local bar he hangs out in with a sexy red head, they both left in a taxi together.” She said looking at Mystic Shadow dressed so drab.” what is with the new fashion we have going here?” she asked her.” Being a house wife now?” she asked regretting those words coming out of her mouth, it made her sound so bitchy.  “I am tired of always dressing like a slut; don’t you get tired of the image?” She asked her with a fake smile.  “Ouch that hurt.” Gloria said under her breath who was dressed in a yellow summer dress and sandals.  “Is my dress style offensive Mystic Shadow?” she asked looking at her white low cut jeans, purple half shirt, and white sneakers.  “No it’s me; I am just going through something personal with in myself.” She told her.  “Can we help in any way?” Tammy asked “is it Hank?” she asked her not wanting to tread on to thin of ice with her.  Mystic Shadow sat down on the couch holding her head in her hands.” I just have something I need to deal with myself, no one can help me. No one.” She told her as tears filled her eyes. “I am going to New York alone.” She told them changing into her warrior uniform and vanishing with out another word.  Roger came down the stares.” where is Mystic Shadow?” he asked looking around.  “She went to New York, alone.” Tammy told him trying to cover the jealousy she felt.  “She was acting strange though, she was crying.” Margaret told him.  “Damn it! Where in New York?” he asked them.  “Why? Are you going to go running after her?” Tammy yelled at him feeling Jealous sitting on the couch.  Roger walked over to her, he leaned over her with his hands on the back of the couch.” you have no reason to be jealous! I was drunk and longed for someone. We were just bed buddies, but as of right now that no longer exist! Moreover, for your information Cheyenne’s adoptive father was killed by what they said looked like a fucking wolf! But how would you know since you were not there? I was though and will always be there for her no matter who doesn’t like it!” he told her.” Now that I got the information from your mind that I needed, good bye!” he told her vanishing.  “I didn’t know about her father. I have been jealous of her and Roger after that night they spent together in Florida. I mean she had all these men wanting her; I just became jealous of her. ” she said feeling lousy thinking he was just going to go to have sex with her.  “You better forget having anything with Roger, because only one woman has branded his heart and that woman is my wife.” Murkcaster told her knowing she was safe with him. It must be a hurtful time for her though; he has not called her Cheyenne in years. If I am not worried about them being alone then you haven’t any reason at all to be concerned.” He told Tammy. He knew when her father was murdered it was the toughest time in her life. ” And another thing he is the only man I don’t have a problem with being in love with my wife.” He told her as he went to the kitchen.  Tammy looked at Margaret full of guilt.” I didn’t know.” She said walking out of the house to be alone as tears filled her eyes.  Brandy woke up the next morning with the cab driver unaware that Mystic Shadow walked the streets of New York hunting for her. The cab driver rolled over touching her breast.” I think I want breakfast.” He said smiling at the gorgeous woman lying beside him.” I do too.” She told him deciding that she would just go for feeding since she was not in the mood for sex. Her eyes began to glow, fangs were growing from her mouth as her body began to transform into the wolf.  The cab driver jumping out of the bed in fear for his life tried to get out of the room. She leaped across the room from the bed jumping on his back, slashing at his flesh, ripping his back open as he let out a blood-curdling scream. She was biting into his flesh torturing him before the kill. Mystic Shadow appeared in the room grabbing her with such strength she flung her across the room standing between her and the victim who was still alive.  “come on you big bad wolf , come and get me!” she yelled at the creature when it leaped on Mystic Shadow clawing and biting into her flesh as it did to her father fifty five years ago. Mystic Shadow relived that day when Roger came to her house to tell her of her father’s murder, which was the day they first met. The wolf was all over Mystic Shadow. It was as if she could not fight off the creature as it was ripping and biting her flesh in a frenzy. Suddenly the wolf went flying and hit the wall as Roger stood in front of Mystic Shadow.” You might have killed her father, but I’ll be damned if you take her too!” he yelled at the wolf.  The wolf getting to its feet leaped at Roger as Mystic Shadow lay bleeding with her eyes closed, she did not move. He did not think she was breathing.  “No!” Mystic caster yelled raising her hand up blowing up the wolf before it could reach him.” please don’t let me be to late.” She said looking at her mother.  “Cheyenne why didn’t you defend yourself?” he asked holding her in his arms as her blood seeped from the wounds made by the wolf.  “I could only think about that day when I met you, it was the same day she killed my father, I saw her kill him and froze.” She told him with gashes on her face and entire body.” Help heal him.” She told Roger as her voice was low, almost a whisper  “What about you?” he asked her worried about her becoming so weak.  “I will take care of her uncle Roger.” Mystic caster told him.  “Save him.” Mystic Shadow told Roger.  He laid her down gently, he did not want to let go of her for fear of her slipping away.  Roger laid his hands on the man as he began to glow, Mystic caster chanted for his and her mothers healing laying her hands on her mother. The man had not one wound on him. Getting up off the floor he looked down at Mystic Shadow. ”man please save the brave lady! She took on that creature to save me!” the man yelled seeing his guardian angel lying on the floor so still and bloody  “I am.” He told him going back to her laying his hands on her with Mystic caster still nothing happened.” why isn’t it working?” he asked her.  Mystic caster crying touching her mothers hair softly “she’s gone Uncle Roger.” She told her leaning over kissing her mother on her forehead.” we don’t have the powers to bring her back. She told him lying across her mother crying.  The man began to cry hearing she did not make it after saving him.  ” No God please! She is a good lady.” He cried looking out his window at the heavens.  “Aggatha does though.” Roger told her picking Mystic Shadow up in his arms looking down at her.” Cheyenne you’re coming back to me.” He told her with tears falling from his eyes onto her face. He looked down at the only woman he ever loved. She was his friend. Even though she knew him and forgave him for everything he had ever done to her, she was his friend and lover.  The man watched as the three of them vanished in front of him.” angels they are truly angels.” He told himself as he looked out the window hoping to catch a glimpse of his angels flying up to heaven.  Roger laid her on the couch yelling for Aggatha when everyone came running.” She’s dead! Bring her back before its too late!” he cried out to Aggatha who laid her hands on her grand daughter praying. Mystic Shadow glowed so brightly as her soul lay back down in her body, she had been dead for thirteen minutes.  “Let me heal these nasty wounds my sweet child.” Aggatha told her crying, they were almost to late in getting her back before the time would have ran out.  Murkcaster stood by Roger.” What happened?” he asked since she never lost a battle.  “She told me she froze remembering the day of her father, when the damned thing was leaping in through the air at me Mystic caster blew it up.” He told him still covered in her blood.  Murkcaster looked worried.” She has never frozen on any battle.” He told him.  “She has never had to battle the beast that killed her father either. She watched the whole attack in a vision; it must have sent her into shock. She snapped out of it to tell me to save the man.” He told Murk caster.  Mystic Shadow sat up on the couch with her wounds healed by Aggatha; she looked strangely as she glanced at everyone. “When I was dead my adoptive father met me telling it wasn’t time for me to come home yet.” She cried into her hand. “I begged him to let me stay!” He told me I had to come back!” She told them crying. “Someone else spoke to me.” She cried so hard curling up in a ball on the couch. “If I have always been a witch why didn’t I have my powers then to save him?” she asked Aggatha.  “The council kept your powers dormant to protect you from the dark side finding you until the time came when you would need them.” Aggatha explained.  Mystic Shadow quickly rose up off the couch standing up in front of her grandmother.” The council?! The council has cost me my father! Patty! All because they keep making decisions of what I can handle and can’t! Interfering with my powers, causing people I love to die!” she yelled as tears were falling down her face.  “Child stop you can not speak about them as you are.” She said frightened for what the council would do.  “The hell I can’t! You’re scared of them aren’t you?” she asked her grandmother. ”well watch this, I learned a lot from being dead.” she told them as her clothes turned into a long white gown made of chiffon that fit her body tightly, the cleavage was cut low to her belly button exposing a diamond belly ring, she had a silver slave bracelet around her bicep with a wolf’s face engraved into it. She had a sterling silver necklace with turquoise stones with matching bracelets on each wrist. Clear six inch spiked heels, her hair up in small ringlets with a thin silver headband around her forehead.  “Council I demand your appearance!” she yelled as she orders them, by her tone of voice, it was obvious she was agitated with them.  Twelve men appeared before her, their faces turned from anger to pure fear. “Yes your Highness how may we serve you?” they asked as they bowed to her.  Everyone looked surprised to see them act like they were in fear of their lives; this was something no one had ever seen before.  “Who has been running the white light, giving out orders and making up the rules?” she asked them with a look of contempt.  Their faces expressed the dread they were feeling.” We have your Highness.” They told her so humble.  She walked around them, her hands behind her back as if inspecting them. “Who is supposed to be giving orders, making decisions over everything?” she asked with raised eye brows.  “You are your Highness.” They replied standing straight and still.  “And at what age of my life was I to become High Priestess? “She asked now standing directly in front of them.  “At the age of twenty one your Highness.” They replied looking straight a head avoiding her eyes.  “That never happened due to your greed for power, ruling the warriors, the riches you enjoyed, and living in my palace was just too much for you to give up! After my real father Fredrick found out what you were doing when my parents were the High priest and priestess he confronted you alone and you then vanquished him! This led him to turn to the dark side where they made him whole again! You dealt with the Dark side to destroy the white light! He was evil and you twelve, the so-called council erased his memory of your betrayal of the white light, the love he had for my mother; you even arranged where he would kill her with the help of the Dark side. She chose death then to join the forces of the Dark side because of her loyalty to you!” she told them, as everyone in the room looked surprised. “You arranged for my death with the wolf by planting the vision of her murdering my adoptive father so I would freeze instead of fighting! You actually succeeded. Except that our Higher Power gave my grand mother the ability to bring back the dead so long as they were not dead for longer then fifteen minutes, because they knew of this day even before you did, during the time I was dead for those thirteen minutes, my Lord informed me through my adoptive father of your dirty dealings . These are the punishments they ordered that I am to hand out to you.” She told them as she had already seized their powers once they entered the room.” your powers are gone so your chants in your minds to destroy us are useless.” She told them with a smile. “You haven’t any powers left. To make sure that you never return to any kind of life form you are being delivered to the one who eat the vile evil souls which this time he gets you alive.” She told them as they tried to run but could not move she had frozen them.  She made a large cage to trap them in to deliver them to the one who eats only an evil soul so it can not ever return. They vanished entering the cave where he stayed. it was only lit by torches on the walls when she entered another cave where he sat on a large throne, he was huge weighing twelve hundred pounds, green skinned, looking almost like a toad with large fangs and nails.” I have been waiting for your arrival .” he told her taking the twelve screaming men opening the cage door as they all fell into his mouth at one time devouring them. “I like souls better they don’t have to be chewed.” he told her after he had ate them burping so loudly it shook the walls of the caves.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 21 by Erotica_Writings © “Thank you.” She said smiling at him.” By the way what is your real name?” she asked since everyone referred to him as the one who ate the evil souls.  “George is my name and that is how I got this name. Who would fear me as George?” He asked smiling. “Go your highness this is no place for a lady.”  Mystic Shadow smiled as she vanished promising never to reveal his real name. She appeared as everyone stood where she left them.  “Who will be our council?” Aggatha asked  “What is the number that I, the seven witches, the three warlocks and your self make?” she asked  “Twelve.” She answered.  “We were supposed to have been given our rightful places as council, something else they neglected to tell us.” She told them watching the expressions on their faces. “And we are redesigning these counsels out fits; I can’t go around looking like Cleopatra.” She told them smiling. “We will meet in the council room in one hour where everyone will be handed their level in the council. We will still battle against evil with our warriors.  Sitting in the council room she made new outfits they would wear when they were in the palace where they would be living. Ninja was ecstatic running through the palace even though he missed his old friend Ralph who died twenty years ago. Mystic Shadow believed Ninja gave his old friend extended life for as long as he could. She gave Ninja a white diamond collar to show his royalty not wanting him to feel left out. She smiled as he ran from room to room in the palace.  When the others walked in including Mystic of the white light, they were surprised to see her in her new outfit. She had on a sheer white long sleeve shirt, white vest and matching skirt above her knees with matching white boots just below her knees, Mystic caster’s was identical to Mystic Shadow’s, except the skirt came to her mid thigh, her boots were thigh high. Aggatha wore a long white dress, the sleeves were long and sheer, white ankle boots. The six other witches had skirts that went to their calves, sheer white long sleeve shirts, with white boots that went to their calves.  Tammy looking at what they had to wear, she smiled at Mystic Shadow. She did this so Roger would find me UN attractive and never come back to me. She thought to her self.  “He was never yours to lose Tammy.” Mystic Shadow told her with a serious look on her face. Tammy did not realize she was reading her mind, feeling embarrassed her looked down at her lap. ” The reason I chose these outfits is because we can not look sleazy, we have high standards to retain while inside of the palace and that means we will no longer be running around here half dressed as we did in the other places that we lived in.” Mystic Shadow told the group looking directly at Tammy. ” this is our entire home, but the palace does have rules. We are to use our spiritual names here, but you will be called by your birth name that your parents at birth gave you, for those who were not born into the white light we will change your names to what the Higher Power has gave us. Besides, it gets to confusing with all the casters for example light caster and lightening. So we are going to change where at the end of some names it will be shadow some will have caster. “She explained to them.” now back to our dress style in the palace. For the men’s wardrobe I chose these.” She said putting Murkcaster in a white three-piece suit, white shirt, white tie with matching white slacks and dress shoes. She put Roger and Saunders in white jackets that hung loose, white shirts with white ties, white loose fitting slacks with white dress shoes. “You look absolutely great!” She said looking at the three of them.  “I have also made new warrior uniforms that will be worn by all warriors of the white light. The females new look.” she said standing up wearing a white tight fitting leather bustier top that had straps around the neck, the top laced up with white leather strings, a short white leather skirt just below the buttocks with very short white leather shorts attached . White thigh high boots. “I see by the men’s expressions it past. What do you ladies think?” she asked turning around and bending over to show the shorts intentionally in front of Roger knowing it would irritate Tammy. Tammy was going to have to get over or have chaos in the council and their battle against evil.  “ for the men, Roger stand up please .” she asked feeling Tammy fuming as Murkcaster smiled knowing his wife was going to bring this jealousy that Tammy had to a head.  Roger stood up wearing a white leather vest that fit tight across his chest and waist, white leather pants that were tight, but they were made to fit to move any way he had to maneuver his body, white army boots that fit high above his ankle. “This is the male warriors. Do we have any complaints?” she asked.  They all loved the new warriors look, especially in white since they were after all the warriors of the white light.  Your birth names given to you by your parents are as follows , Patty Coral shadow, Tammy Jada caster, Gloria Crystal caster, Alicia Destiny shadow , Margaret Dream caster, Lindsey Enchantress caster, Aggatha named by her parents Guardian caster. Now for the men you my darling will remain Murkcaster since it was both of my parents names combined and a great honor to carry. Roger Knight Shadow, Saunders Rain Caster.” She told them. “From now on you will be called by these names.” She told them as the women smiled feeling honored to carry the names that their parents gave them since they died for them so they could live.  “Now as it is known I am the High Priestess by blood, Murkcaster by marriage, so of course our duties will remain the same. Mystic caster you are second in command since you would be the next High Priestess at my demise. Dream caster you are to work with Mystic of the white light so when they need us you will send out the appropriate female warriors, Destiny shadow you are over the female warriors keeping them in shape assigning them to their duties and the evil they are to vanquish, Crystal caster you are to track the evil and inform Destiny shadow of their locations, Jada caster you are in charge of tracking evil mortals and deciding if it is to be given to Mystic of the white light or if it goes to Destiny shadow, Coral caster you are in charge of tracking the internet for the supernatural or mortal forms of evil. Enchantress caster you are in charge of the security making sure it remains safe and Guardian caster you will continue your work as you always have. Knight shadow you are second in command , Rain caster you are in charge of the male warriors keeping them in shape assigning them to the ones they to vanquish and sending those needed by Mystic of the white light.’ She told them taking a deep breath.  “I am now going to right a wrong I summon Fredrick to appear before the council.” She said standing up.  Fredrick appeared looking puzzled at everyone in the room.” Where is the council?” he asked her.  “You’re looking at it.” She told him as he was even more confused.” I have sent for you to right a wrong that was done to you many years ago” She told him placing her hands on his head restoring the memory that had been stolen from him.  Fredrick dropped to his knees crying.” I was not evil because of me! But because of them! They made me kill her! Oh my sweet, sweet love, please forgive me.” He said crying into his hands.  A white light appeared before him.” I forgive you Fire caster.” Charmelmystic told him helping him up off the floor.  He took her in his arms as they hugged he looked into her eyes.  ” Thank you for your forgiveness.” He told her feeling the goodness and love that he had when he was a great warrior.  She kissed him with tears in her eyes as she vanished.  Mystic Shadow stood looking at him.” I can not give you back life, but now that you are the great warrior in spirit as you were in life I am placing you with Mystic of the white Light to be by her side to rule with her over the spirit warriors of the white light.” She told him as tears rolled down her face.  Mystic of the white light stood by his side.” We will be great together.” She told him smiling taking his hand.  “Yes I think we will.” He told her as they vanished.  Mystic Shadow and the rest smiled knowing they recovered a lost warrior who was never evil only made to think he was. “The meeting is over.” Mystic Shadow told them. “I want to talk with you Jada caster.” She told her looking serious.  “Yes Mystic Shadow, how I can help you?” she asked in a cold voice.  “Look if you want we can battle it out! If it gets it out of your system.” She told her not wanting there to be any ill feelings between them.  “Why don’t you get out of his system?” Jada caster asked her with anger in her eyes.  “Look damn it! I can not help that he has pledged his heart to me! I too have pledged my heart to him, But I took vows with Murkcaster!” she told her getting angry.  “And Knight Shadow will become your pledge if anything happens to Murkcaster!” She yelled at Mystic Shadow.  “For your information it was Murkcaster who chose Knight Shadow to be second in command along with his name because he knows he is in love with me! He knows I love him as well and chose him to replace him should anything happen to him!” she yelled back as this shocked Jada caster to hear it was Murkcaster and not Mystic Shadow.  “I am sorry. I thought you were trying to have your cake and eat it too.” She told her.  “I do love Knight Shadow, but I am bound to Murkcaster for eternity.” She told her hoping it was over with.  Jada caster began to laugh realizing the only reason she wanted him was because she knew he would never be hers.” I am so petty! I could not ever have him and it made me want him even more. Even though I do not really love or want him.” She told Mystic Shadow as she slowly walked up to her wrapping her arms around her, hugging her tightly as tears fell down her face.” Thank you for making me see what I was actually doing. “She told her kissing her cheek.  “You and Knight Shadow are to much a like, neither one of you want a real commitment.” She told her smiling at her.  ”your right and I have been checking out this hot warrior, he is so tall, tanned, blue eyes, blond curly hair and muscles that ripple all over his body! I think I will go watch him work out.” She said smiling.  “Wait! I forgot to show everyone the new work out suits.” She said as Jada caster looked at the white latex one piece suit. The top half looked like a tank top cut low, the bottom half had long pant legs fitting tight against the body.” I think you will like his when you see his body, I mean suit.” She told her winking with a sly smile.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 20 by Erotica_Writings © They were all preparing to go to the manor where there would be a witches ball held in honor of Aggatha’s birthday she would be three hundred years old. She was dressed in a long white satin gown with a high collar trimmed in lace, long sleeves and heels they had her seated at a gold throne with black velvet cushions, this way she was able to see everyone dancing.  All eight witches each wore tight fitting strapless gowns with sequins. Mystic Shadow wore black, Mystic caster wore a red gown, the other six wore either dark green, gold, dark or light blue, dark purple, or a light violet with matching heels and long formal gloves, The six witches wore pearl necklaces with matching earrings and bracelets while Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster wore diamonds.  All the warlocks wore black tuxedos with black dress shoes; their shirts were white with small ruffles and black bow ties.  Mystic caster and Lightening caster were waltzing on the ball room floor as Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster watched their little girl all grown up, they were truly proud of her.  Fierce caster asked for Mystic Shadow to waltz with him. He looked deep into her eyes, “You are my world you know this right?” he asked her placing his finger softly over her lips.” Wait let me finish, I love you Cheyenne, and one day you will be my bride because we are soul mates and are meant to be together.” He told her as she laid her head on his chest.  A single tear trickled from her eye. “Oh Roger, I have never stopped loving you through all of these years. My heart has been aching for you. “She told him looking up into his eyes.  Roger gently kissed her lips not caring that Murkcaster was watching them and fuming.  Suddenly there was a loud explosion leveling the manor with everyone inside.  Mystic caster tried to look around, but everything was all black, she kept hearing a female’s voice calling for Patty, she slowly opened her eyes, a nurse with blond hair stood over her smiling.  “Welcome back patty, you’ve been in a coma for nine months. We were hoping you’d come out of it after the birth of your son today.” The woman told her.  “Son? Where am I?” she asked feeling sore.  “Sweet heart you just gave birth to my precious grandson.” A woman with red hair and green eyes told her standing next to the nurse.” You gave mama a fright when you went into that coma right after you got pregnant.”  “Mama? What are you people talking about?” she asked not knowing who this woman was.  “Well here’s your hubby he can tell you all about it.” The nurse said as she stepped a side so her husband could stand next her bed.  She looked at him in shock not believing what she was seeing or hearing as she looked at Chadwick standing there. He leaned over kissing her lips.  “Patty you gave me the scare of my life when you went into that coma.” He said kissing her again.” but the doctor told me you would come out of it as soon as the baby was born and you did sweetheart.” He said smiling down at her.  “Here is your son Patty.” The nurse came into the room holding the infant then putting him in her arms.  She looked down at the child, he was very precious, but this woman was not her mother, her mother was Mystic Shadow, her father was Murkcaster who vanquished Chadwick and she was a powerful witch herself. What is going on? she thought to herself.” where is my father?” she asked the people standing around her.  “Honey your daddy Alex died three years ago don’t you remember?” her mother asked.  “No I don’t remember, my mother’s name is Mystic Shadow, my father is Murkcaster and he killed you!” she said looking at Chadwick.  “Well Chadwick looks awful alive to me.” Her mother told her laughing.  “You were probably hallucinating while you were in the coma. Now lets put this hungry boy on your breast so he can eat.” The nurse told her.  Patty could not breast feed, the nurse reassured her it happens a lot that mother’s cannot nurse.  Three months after being home, she still remembered her life as a witch and Lightening caster her love. That night Chadwick had her wear a sheer white gown showing every inch of her body. She looked as if she never had a child. He made love to her caressing her breast making her cringe when he touched her. He sensed she was not receptive of him, he tried everything to bring her passions out, but nothing happened. He took her roughly while she lay beneath him crying. He lay on top of her with his eyes closed breathing heavy from his orgasm. Maybe I did just dream all of that stuff about witches and warlocks she thought to herself. Closing her eyes, she remembered the manor exploding at the ball. Was it or wasn’t it real? She thought to herself as she fell off to sleep.  The next day she tried to use her magic, but nothing happened when she tried to levitate the lamp. She heard the baby crying.” God what is wrong with me? I feel nothing for this child!” she said aloud as she stood looking down into the bassinet.  “You will in time.” Chadwick told her standing behind her wrapping his arms around her waist kissing her neck.  “Why did I not have breast milk if I gave birth to this child?” she asked him.  “You’re starting that stuff again?” he asked getting agitated with her.” I don’t want to hear it anymore!” he yelled at her.  “Then don’t listen!” She yelled back at him.  Chadwick became enraged with anger when she yelled at him slapping her so hard across her face she fell to the ground. He grabbed her by her long hair dragging her to their bedroom throwing her on the bed; he jumped on her, sitting on top of her beating her with his fist. “don’t you ever talk to me in disrespect!” he yelled in her face getting up as he ripped his clothes off then tearing her pants off her throwing her on her stomach, he sodomized her. Her screams could be heard for miles. When he was finished, he dressed leaving the room. She laid very still, her tears stinging the cuts on her face from her beating.  Mother please! If you are alive or real, come and rescue me… please! She thought to her self-crying from all the pain. She saw a brilliant light glowing above her.” Mystic of light!” she whispered so he could not hear her.  “I would have been here sooner, but we could not track you they had cast a spell blocking us. Hold on sweetie your mother is coming. Let me warn you though she will be here as the Banshee.” She told her.” I will stay here to prevent any more harm to you child.” She told her.  “The baby is it mine?” she asked.” Why is mother a Banshee?”  “She is warning them of the impending deaths to come… theirs.” She told her smiling.  “No. You have only been gone for three months when they blew up the manor that is a demon in the bassinet.” She told her putting up a force field around the bed so no harm could come to Mystic caster when she heard the wails of the Banshee coming.  Chadwick ran into the room hearing the wails getting closer, it was penetrating his ears, his eyes were glowing red.” Make it stop!” he demanded in his true demonic voice.  “Go to hell!” she yelled at him sitting on the bed.  When he tried to jump on top of her again he received electrical shocks knocking him to the floor just as Mystic Shadow dove through the window with a high pitch wail that was shattering glass in every part of the house and the small town the demons had recreated. Mystic of light joined Mystic caster on the bed; she had made the force shield sound proof. Mystic Shadow stood over him in a long silver dress, her hair, skin everything was silver, her eyes were lined in a dark gray, and her lips were a bluish gray as she leaned over him screaming her earring piercing scream in his face. She stopped screaming, looked back at Mystic caster bruised, and bloody being held by Mystic of light. She turned back to him, she screamed so loud it began to shake the house. Her rage made her screams louder then before, her body began to spin faster and faster rising up in the air as she turned into Mystic Shadow fully dressed in her warrior uniform, the other warriors were going from house to house destroying any and everything demonic in the town the demons had recreated.  Mystic Shadow dropping to the ground on her feet grabbed the demon Chadwick off the ground with her two hands holding him by the collar of his shirt.” Beat me mother fucker!” she yelled having her face inches away from his. She began beating him first with her fist until his face was pulverized; jumping into the air she kicked him with her feet sending him flying into the wall.” You like beating women? You like beating my daughter?!” she yelled using her magic spinning him so fast in the air and with all her might and anger blew him up. “I Mystic shadow send these demons to the one who feeds on them!” she yelled still feeling rage with in her she went to the babies bassinet where it laid with glowing eyes hissing at her , flying up at her with fangs to attack her. Mystic Shadow sent it into the wall so hard its body smashed with one quick movement of her hand she blew it up. Mystic Shadow turned to see the red haired woman who pretended to be Mystic caster’s mother.  “You stupid bitch why don’t you try me?” the demon yelled turning into her true demonic form unaware who the witch was she just challenged.  Mystic Shadow smiled.” give me all you got! You slime ball from hell.” She told the demon.  The demon charged at Mystic Shadow with her fangs and long razor nails, missing Mystic Shadow when she vanished causing the demon to smash into the wall.  Mystic Shadow appeared behind her. “Hey bitch!” she yelled into her ear.  The demon turned to her trying to grab her when one of her nails cut her arm. “That’s it! You just went and pist off the High Priestess of the white light!” she told the demon as she looked at her cut.  The demon changed back into the woman’s form.” Please I did not know it was you, please don’t destroy me.” She begged.  “You knew you slime balls kid napped my daughter though! Thought your spells would keep us from her! But hey ok, I will let you live.” She told her walking away shrugging her shoulders.  The demon could not believe she was going to let her live.” Thank you Mystic Shadow. “She told her relieved that she would not be destroyed.  ” on second thought, I don’t like you.” She told the demon using her powers to the max blowing her up. “Oops I lied.” She said with her hand up to her mouth and a smile on her face as the demon exploded.  Soon all the warriors were at the house in the room with Mystic caster there must have been forty of them when her mother walked into the room. “Mom!” she cried running to her mother. Mystic Shadow held her daughter tightly in her arms; both were crying as well as all of the other witches, the warlocks had tears forming in their eyes watching the reunion.  “Where is dad, Uncle Roger and Uncle Saunders?” she asked.  Mystic Shadow looked at her daughter.” Their watching football.” She told her as she adjusted her top of her warrior uniform clearing her voice.  Mystic caster had a look of shock come over her face. “oh.” She replied.  Mystic Shadow began laughing.” They will be here when the surrounding areas are demon free before we leave.” She told her daughter hugging her. ”we need to work on your humor though.” She said teasing her.  “What about the explosion at the Manor?” she asked her mother.  “There wasn’t any. They planted that in your mind, they removed your powers, but they will return when we are out of their demonic town, the one thing they left was your telepathic communication because they didn’t know about it. I kept waiting to hear something the first month, when I did not hear anything I became more and more worried for your safety, we searched the world and we kept coming up empty handed even though we destroyed plenty of demons along the way. Then this morning when I heard you ask me if I was alive or real to please come rescue you.” She told her placing her hand over her mouth kneeling down on one knee as tears spilled from her eyes and down her face holding her head down as she cried.” that’s… when I knew my little girl… was still alive.” She told her looking up at her daughter as tears streaked her face standing back up Mystic caster grabbed her mother.  “Oh how I love you!” she told her holding her mother tightly crying.  ”and I never want to experience that feeling ever again. Not knowing where you were, if you were safe or being tortured. I kept talking to you hoping you would hear me.” She told her.  “That’s why I could not forget you like they wanted me to.” She told her. “So why a Banshee mother?” she asked her.  “They would be expecting the warriors of the white light, but not the Banshee who warns people that death is coming. So I figured it would be appropriate to warn them that we were going to destroy them.” She explained to her.  “How loud is the actual scream of the Banshee?” she asked her mother.  “I will show you.” She told her transforming back into the Banshee as she wailed the scream of the Banshee.  Mystic caster quickly covered her mother’s mouth.” Ok mother I understand why Mystic of light put up the sound barrier.” She said turning her head side ways trying to clear her hearing.” by the way the look of the Banshee is not for you.” She said laughing.  Mystic Shadow had not transformed into herself as the rest of the warriors appeared with Murkcaster, Fierce caster and Light caster, The men looked at Mystic Shadow with strange looks.  “I hope your changing back to your normal look.” Murkcaster asked. “I’d hate to go to bed with that every night.  Mystic Shadow opened her mouth to wail when Mystic caster covered her mouth.” Mother no! please the ringing just stopped in my ears.” She told her smiling.  Mystic Shadow transformed back to her normal self as Murkcaster grabbed his daughter hugging and kissing her. When he placed her down Fierce caster and Light caster grabbed her, hugging her tightly. Lightening caster walked up behind them. Everyone stood silent as they watched the two lovers coming together. He touched her face lightly seeing the cuts and bruises on her face and body, tears formed in his eyes.” I am so sorry. I have been so scared that I would never see you again.” He told her taking her gently in his arms.” I love you with my heart, body and soul Mystic caster.” He told her kissing her gently on her cut and swollen lips.  “I love you too, your face kept coming into my memories, I knew you were my true love.” She told him touching his face.  “Will you marry me?” he asked her with his charming smile, his blue eyes looked like they were sparkling.  “Yes I will marry you.” She told him as tears ran down her face.  Lightening caster turned to Murkcaster and Mystic Shadow.” I am asking for your permission to marry your daughter your High Priest and Priestess Murkcaster and Mystic Shadow?” he asked them feeling very nervous.  “What do you think Mystic Shadow?” Murkcaster asked his wife.  Mystic Shadow looking serious at the two of them.” I don’t know about all of that now.” She told them looking very stern seeing their hearts dropped.” can’t you two just shack up? It would be less of a head ache then a wedding is.” She told them trying not to laugh at their surprised expressions.” Of course you have our blessings and our permission to join together in the Holy union.” She told them smiling as tears came to her eyes.  Mystic caster grabbed her mother hugging her.” Oh thank you! For a moment I thought you drank to much Banshee juice.” She told her teasingly.  With a look of joy and excitement, Mystic Shadow began to jump up and down like a child. “They have Banshee juice? Ooh, I want some! Can I pleeaasseeeeee? ” Mystic Shadow asked smiling at her daughter. Mystic caster shaking her head at her mother as they all vanished going home.  Once they were back at their home Aggatha hugged her grand daughter as tears of joy filled her eyes. “Thank the heavens your ok.” She told her kissing her cheek.  “She will be perfect in just a few moments.” Mystic Shadow told her taking her daughter to her room.  “Lay on the bed baby.” She told her, Mystic Shadow laid her hands on her daughters body, a light began to glow over her daughter as the cuts, bruises and swelling disappeared.” now you are healed.” She told her kissing her forehead.  “Thank you mother.” She told her as they left the room joining the others arm in arm happy to be reunited again.  Mystic Shadow and the seven witches prepared the arrangements for the engagement party for Mystic caster and Lightening caster. Using their magic they had her trying on tight fitting gowns, loose fitting, ones that looked like it was the Queens of England from the 1800’s. Finally, they came up with the perfect one, a pearl white gown that had very thin straps, matching gloves and heels. The witches then trapped Lightening caster having him in different tuxedos when they decided he looked better in the plain black, a white shirt, a black bow tie and black dress shoes. Mystic Shadow decided not to use the manor since that was where they kidnapped her daughter. Suddenly Fredrick appeared before her.  “Your not suppose to be here!” she told him in a firm voice.  “Mystic of light gave me permission; I have an offer for you.” He told her feeling he may be blown up at any minute by a warrior thinking he was still evil.  “What is it that you want?” she asked seeing a drastic change in him.  “You could use the family’s French castle.” he told her.  “We have a French castle?” she asked him.  “Yes, if you come with me I will show you.” He told her.  “Alright let’s go and this better not be some trick.” She warned him as they vanished.  When they appeared in front of it, Mystic Shadow was in awe of its beauty. They walked inside it was so huge everything was still in place as he had left it two hundred years ago. It was dusty with cobwebs hanging from the chandeliers, the stare banister and the corner of the walls. She stood in the middle of the room using her powers she cleaned the whole place.  He was pleased to see his daughter happy; I only wished I could have been there when she was growing up. he thought to himself. He took for granted the simple things like a daughter’s hug, something he will never experience. She turned to him as she heard his thoughts; walking up to him using her magic she made him solid for the moment. She wrapped her arms around his neck. “I forgive you father.” She told him with tears in her eyes.  He cried in her arms. “Thank you my child.” He told her holding her tightly.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 19 by Erotica_Writings © Three months had past since their battle with Karlin, Mystic caster and Lightening caster had grown very close and were planning a week in Hawaii to seal their relationship as a couple. Everyone was sitting around in the garden discussing the couple’s trip to Hawaii when they noticed that Norma was sitting very still in her favorite rocker near the different colored roses.  “Norma?” Mystic Shadow asked walking over to her sitting so still in the rocker. She touched her hand knowing she had past on. Mystic Shadow dropped to her knees putting her head on the woman’s lap as tears fell down her face. “Good- bye my old dear friend.” She told her rising to her feet. “We need to prepare for Norma’s funeral.” She said wiping the tears away that streaked her face.  They all gathered around Norma and the men carried her body to be prepared for the services at mid night. Murkcaster who blessed her, lighting of the candles by him self and Mystic Shadow, held it. Then they asked if her soul could join the warriors of the white light. Mystic of the light appeared to greet Norma’s soul.  “Are you ready Mystics mortal?” she asked smiling as the bright light radiated through out the room.  “Yes, I am ready to join you and your warriors with such pride for being one of you.” She said as she looked as she did when she was only in her twenty’s.  The two white lights soared around the room then vanished as everyone watched the beautiful occasion take place. Murkcaster and Mystic Shadow were walking home when they saw Mystics mortal rocking by her favorite roses. They smiled as they stood in front of her.  “Hope you don’t mind me dropping by every so often to look at my pretty roses.” She said smiling up at them, she glowed so brightly.  “Come by anytime.” Mystic Shadow told her.  “Well I have to get started with training.” She told them and vanished.  That night Mystic Shadow held Murkcaster close to her lying in bed. When they appeared on an island with a TikKi bar that served juices and fruits. They looked around at the torchlight’s around the area, it was beautiful.  “Why are we here?” she asked him looking around at the beauty of the island.  “I thought you brought us here.” He told her looking at the long white sheer gown she had on flowing in the wind, her hair flew just as freely.” nice outfit, very sexy on you.” He told her smiling.  “You look very native in your short green wrap.” She said looking at her husband exchanging glances.  “I brought you here.” an English speaking man told them from the bar. He looked very handsome in his white long sleeve shirt that fit him loose and black slacks, his hair was coal black and in a ponytail, his eyes were so blue that they looked like ice.  “And who are you?” Murkcaster asked the man who was making love to his wife with his eyes.  “Well if you must know, my name is Alex and every few years we bring couples here to test their love for one another.” He told them.  “Ok how is it you test us?” Mystic Shadow asked feeling as if he was undressing her. Even though he did not have to with this gown on.  “Well you will spend a few days with me and your husband will spend a few days with my wife Alana.” He said pointing to his wife who had on the identical outfit as Mystic Shadow. Her hair was long and dark brown, big brown eyes and a body that was very tempting to any man.  “You’re out of your minds!” Murkcaster told him looking at the woman.  “Don’t trust your self Murkcaster?” he challenged him.  “I trust myself.” He told him.  “You had better give me proof before I blast you, your wife and island into tiny pieces of yesterday.” Mystic shadow told him.  When Aggatha appeared.” it is a test child.” She told her.  “Well this is easy for me to pass.” she said looking at the man smugly.  “They are to give you full body massages, intimate dinners, and to seduce how ever they wish.” She told them. “If you lose you will forfeit your place as High Priest Murkcaster. Mystic Shadow was born into her position it can not be taken away just your place and he becomes High priest.”  “This is crazy!” Mystic Shadow yelled.” He will never be High priest! I will never be his anything!” She said giving Murkcaster a look of you had better not screw up.  The woman took Murkcaster by his hand leading him into a hut. She rubbed his body with oils. As the man did the same with Mystic Shadow who was complaining under her breath.  Mystic Shadow could not believe this was real as the man ran his hands sensually over her entire back, leaning over her.” doesn’t it feel marvelous?” he asked her whispering in her ear.  “I’ve had better.” She told him as he had her turn over massaging her body and suddenly she stopped him when it came to her breast.  ” touch me and you loose your hands.” She told him smiling.  Murkcaster kept thinking of the time Mystic shadow just about killed him over the entity and was not going through that again.” That’s enough.” he told the woman getting up off the table as he walked out of the hut as he saw Aggatha’s image was still there when he walked up to it his hand ran through it. “It’s a trap!” he said pushing the woman down as he ran to the hut to find the man getting ready to spray her with a chemical. “It’s some kind of trap get up!” he told his wife. “I don’t know what you’re up too, but I am going to beat you until you tell me.” He said picking the man up with his magic. “This frightened the man who was very much human.  “Wait! I don’t know what you people are; I just know someone paid me and that woman to seduce you to break you and Mystic Shadow up.” He said as Murkcaster then lifted the woman up in the air. “If you want to live you will tell us the truth.” He told them as Mystic Shadow decided to scare these two mortal’s for being so conniving. Mystic Shadow rose to the woman’s eye level. “did they tell you we eat people?” she snarled at the woman while she transformed herself into the classic looking witch, green and ugly with long white hair , the black witches outfit. She floated over to the man grabbing his face and she stuck her tongue in his mouth grabbing his crotch at the same time. “Oh yes we will have fun before I eat you for my dinner.” She told him trying not to laugh.  “The mans name was Light caster!” he yelled in pure terror. Everyone was laughing outside. As they walked out side the seven witches, Light caster and Fierce caster were laughing as lightening caster stood by Mystic caster. “Happy twenty first anniversary!” they yelled. “You can let them down now.” Light caster told Murkcaster as he let them fall to the ground.  “I owe you for this one buddy since it’s your anniversary too!” he said as he had three gorgeous blonds on him and one very handsome blond man picking up Lindsey.  “Ok I get the message, lets enjoy our anniversaries.” He said pulling away from the women and grabbing Lindsey from the man.  They celebrated their anniversaries UN aware they were being watched by demonic beings who had been condemned to the island for eternity never leaving it. The witches and warlocks were the first living things they had seen in seventeen years since the last boat of tourist were lost at sea and landed on this island. The women were raped and tortured before giving into their demands for their souls to stay alive making their husbands watch their wives turning into demonic creatures themselves. They watched their mate’s pleasure the demons sexually. The women ripped their hearts out of their husband’s chest cavity for refusing to give their souls to evil. Now they had new victims and more souls to collect from this group of partiers, UN aware they were the warriors of the white light. They waited patiently as the first couple went exploring the island. Mystic Shadow told the two mortals not to go to far or they could end up lost. The demons followed them into the woods. Alex stopped, he pushed Alana up against the tree and he kissed her passionately running his hands over body , Alana dropped the gown she was wearing onto the ground. Alex began to disrobe when the demons watched them passionately kiss as they fondled each other’s bodies. The demons came up to the couple both the female and male demons. Alex raised his head from Alana’s neck being startled seeing them there. “Boy you guys don’t give up do you?” he asked laughing thinking it was the group of partiers playing a joke on them.  One of the female demons got on her knees and began to kiss him placing his hands on her breast.  “Hey I am all for a group orgy baby.” He said as he caressed her breast laying back as she straddled him.” Oh baby, you are good.” He told the female demon.  One of the male demons began to fondle Alana as she lay on the ground.” hello there .” she said smiling believing she wasn’t in any danger as the demon laid on top of her kissing her as he entered her body .Aliana moaned in pleasure.” Oh yes.” She whispered as he was giving her such pleasure.  The witches and the warlocks were all laughing when Alex and Alana came back to their group hand in hand. Murkcaster looked at Alex he could tell a difference about him.  “Something happen in the woods to you two?” he asked as he saw claw marks on their skin.  “No, we just got a tad wild.” Alex said smiling at Murkcaster.  Mystic Shadow looked at the couple thinking they looked a little strange since they returned to the group. She then noticed something moving in the bushes, but before she could say anything they were surrounded by fifteen demons and Alex leaped on top of her from across the table knocking her to the ground. The rest were also attacked by the demons.  “I give great massages!” he told her grabbing her breast when she threw him through the air with her powers.  Rising up from the ground she had changed into her warrior uniform removing his hands.” I told you if you touched my breast I would remove your hands!” she told him as he looked where his hands once were and now were just stubs squirting blood.” now kiss your ass good bye! ” She told him blowing him up as the other warriors were also now in uniform fighting the demons. They destroyed every one of them.  They all looked at each other to make sure they got them all. Mystic Shadow looked at Saunders.” Great party you threw, lets go home.” She said as they all vanished from the island.  They never noticed the six pair of eyes that were hidden in the bushes. They were the children of the male demon’s and the women making their off springs half demon and mortal. They would wait for new victims to happen upon the island. They did not know they were not trapped to the island as their demon fathers were. The oldest male Chadwick was nineteen, the oldest female Ursula was eighteen and pregnant by Chadwick.  “Others will come and we will continue the traditions of our parents.” He told his other siblings as he led them to their cave.  That night he dreamt of the beautiful witch Mystic caster that he was in her bedroom, he could see it so clearly, he had never seen anything except for the caves. She lay on her back wearing a white shear nightgown; he stood over her bed then kissing her lips softly. The feelings he felt startled him waking him from his dream.  Mystic caster’s eyes opened, she felt like someone had just kissed her, but she saw no one. She looked around the room; she had an almost eerie feeling that her room had been invaded by somebody or something. Convincing herself, she must have been dreaming of her beloved Light caster.  Chadwick who had his mothers features of a human was tall, his hair was red, his eyes were blue. Unlike his siblings, whose features were deformed looking. Only his eyes glowed during intercourse or if angered. He could not get the girl of his dreams out of his mind. There were times he could actually visualize her with water running down her body, she used something white and foamy on it. He would become aroused visualizing her nakedness, becoming agitated that he would never be able to touch her.  “I have to have her somehow.” He said aloud to himself.  “Who do you have to have?” Ursula asked him sitting next to him. She could see his arousal since they did not know about clothing.  She kissed him as he closed his eyes thinking of Mystic caster and took Ursula thinking of the beautiful girl he saw and now wanted more then ever.  Mystic caster felt at times she was being watched, but did not pay it any attention thinking it was her imagination. She went about with her normal life style preparing for her trip with Lighting caster to Hawaii. That night as she slept in her bed she dreamt of a tall red haired boy who was naked, kissing her softly, he had his hands on her breast and he began to assault her, trying to wake up from her dream, but was unable to stop the assault on her body. He raped her with brute force. Mystic caster still being a virgin could feel the pain when he entered her. She had never seen him before, but she could actually smell the stench from his body and breathe as he violated her body. She felt so helpless against him. This began to be a nightly attack on her by him. Tonight something happened to her, she began to feel urges that she never felt before. Her body moved with his, both of their breathing becoming heavier with each thrust of his body going harder and deeper until she moaned from the pleasure of the orgasm she had never experienced before. She opened her eye realizing she was not sleeping.  He gazed down at her with red glowing eyes “this is real.” he said out loud realizing somehow he had left the island. “I am free of the island to be with you.” He told her touching her face.  “Who are you?” she asked him as she got away from him covering up her body.  “I am Chadwick from the island that you were at when you destroyed my parents.” He told her wondering how he got here.  “So you come here and rape me in my sleep for revenge?” she asked as she put on her warriors uniform sending a message to her mother telepathically.  “No! I thought I was having a dream of you in my sleep.” he told her.” well until now.” He told her looking around the room.  Mystic Shadow appeared looking at the strange young man sitting on the bed naked.” what is going on?” she asked Mystic caster.  “Somehow he was dreaming and transported himself here. he is from that island. I thought for the past week I was dreaming of being raped by him and tonight he gave me pleasures that I could not resist and here he is.” She told her mother  “I see, you’re a demon?” she asked Chadwick.  “I am half demon and mortal my mother told me.” He said trying to explain what his mother told them as children. How they were lost at sea ending up on the island,” they had to choose life by giving their souls to the demons or die. The males chose death, but the women my mother told me were too cowardly and gave into the demons that impregnated them. They would mate with us as children, and they got pleasure from watching us children mating. We were suppose to be condemned to the island for eternity, but somehow I left.” He said looking at Mystic caster.” I now want to claim my mate to bare our children and serve evil together.” He told them boldly.  “I am not your mate!” Mystic caster yelled at him.  “We mated in the rituals for four nights and I tasted your virgin’s blood you are mine!” he told her walking towards her when Mystic shadow held him in the air.” No half demon is going to do anything with my daughter except die.” She told him through gritted teeth.” You raped her! You crept in here in the night when she was sleeping, the only thing you are getting is a good bye gift called being vanquished.  “I planted my seed in her belly she is mine!” he yelled as his eyes began to glow red.” She belongs to me now! ” He said sounding so demonic.  “Like hell she does!” Fierce caster said standing behind Mystic Shadow and blasting the boy with his powers.  “There are more on that island.” Mystic Shadow told him.  “Well I will take the warriors and finish the island off making sure no others wander off of it. Get her to the doctors to end any pregnancy that might have been started.” He said kissing Mystic caster good-bye and gently touching Mystic Shadows face with his fingertips.  Mystic Shadow summon for the doctor who delivered her children, the doctor arrived taking Mystic caster into her bedroom and injected her with a serum to interrupt any pregnancy that might be in progress. “You will not be pregnant if he did succeed in planting his vile seed in you.” She said patting her hand then vanishing.  The warlocks went back to the island finding the cave where the demon children were. They vanquished them and as they were vanishing Murkcaster blew up the island. Lightening caster understood about canceling the trip since her ordeal with the rape he was very patient.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 18 by Erotica_Writings © Mystic caster just turned twenty one, she was as beautiful as her mother and had her fathers intelligence, the powers of her parents, grand parents and ancestors, she would practice with the young male warriors who had trouble concentrating on their abilities because of her beauty and her body. She would wear a pair of black tight stretch pants, a white top that she cut in half with a pair of white sneakers. Her hair she wore pulled up into a tight ponytail on top of her head. One young warrior Lightening caster longed to ask her out, but he was to shy to ask her. He could hardly wait until his day that they worked out together. He was tall, with black curly hair, blue eyes; his body was of a Greek God. Today was his day to train with her, he waited impatiently for her, and she finally came even though she was twenty minutes late. He noticed she was not in her usual work out clothes, but in a pair of baggy pants and a sweatshirt. She smiled at him as she approached him and suddenly she lunged at him causing him to fall backwards with her landing on top of him on the ground.  “when are you going to ask me out?” she asked him as she laid on top of his body smiling down at him with her brown eyes, her long brown hair tied up in a pony tail.  “Tonight?” he asked shocked that she felt the same way about him.  “Ok, I accept your offer for a date tonight.” She said as their faces were inches away from one another and she slowly kissed him lightly on his lips.  He wrapped his arms around her kissing her passionately as his heart beat wildly for he had always dreamt of this day. She looked into his blue eyes running her fingers through his hair. “Why have you made me wait so long for you?” she asked him with a pouting look on her face.  “I was afraid you’d reject me if I approached you.” He told her as he kissed her lips lightly.  “Well we have to call off training I need to get ready for tonight.” She said kissing him one last time then getting up off him as she ran off.  He sat up on the ground leaning back on one arm smiling as he watched her run into the cottage where he would pick her up tonight for their date.  The dark side had been watching Mystic caster as they were planning her demise for she was to powerful to keep around or evil could be vanquished all together. They summoned the most evil warlock they had, Karlin. He was not only evil , but handsome as well, his hair blond and perfectly in place, his chiseled looks, his body was toned and very tanned, his eyes were of a pale green. He was known for his ability to trap women with his seduction, children with false kindness earning their trust then suck their very life out of them turning them into grains of dust, on witches he not only turned into grains of dust, but collected their powers and souls. He sat in the dark dungeon of evil making his deal to destroy this witch he wanted one other witch who vanquished his brothers in Jamaica and releasing the children’s souls they had collected.  “I want Mystic Shadow as well as her daughter; I will turn them both into grains of dust.” He told them with pure hatred for Mystic Shadow causing his eyes to glow red.  “You know we want all of those bitches done away with, along with the three warlocks.” They told him.  “So be it then.” He said as he looked down at his assistant a petite blond with blue eyes that he kept half dressed.” We need to have a private meeting before I begin my mission.” He told the Dark Side leaders. Taking her into a room for her to sexually please him.  Mystic caster was so excited over her date with Lightening caster. She and the six witches, her mother, grand mother and Norma, who was very old now and laid in her bed watching the youngest of the witches trying on different outfits, finally she picked the perfect outfit, a white satin short sleeveless dress, white knee boots, and she wore her hair French braided with daisies inter twined into the braid.  “You have protection right Patty?” Tammy asked her causing the younger witch to blush who was given Patty’s earth name to carry on.  “I don’t plan on doing that with him tonight.” She said trying to cover her embarrassment.  “That’s what we all say.” Gloria told her as she threw her a package. ”just to be on the safe side, you never know.” She told her smiling and walking away.  The witches all laughed even Norma gave a chuckle.  Poor Norma she has been through so much. Mystic Shadow thought to her self.  That night when Lightening caster came to pick up Mystic caster Aggatha reminded them that when they were around humans they are Patty and Tony. The young couple vanished as they went to a restaurant in the Bahamas where they then walked down the beach. He took her into his arms kissing her.  “I have loved you since we were six years old.” he told her looking down into her eyes as he softly touched her face.  “I have always loved you too, like I knew we were meant to be together.” She told him laying her head on his chest listening to his heart beat.” I want to make love to you.” She told him closing her eyes as if making a wish.  “I want to make love to you, but I want it to be perfect when we do.” He told her kissing her passionately.  That night at the end of their date she lay in bed envisioning when they finally make love together.  The next morning Aggatha told Mystic Shadow about the rash of attacks on witches and humans. Their souls and powers were collected then the victim turned into grains of dust. Mystic Shadow knew she and the eight witches would have to go and find the one responsible for these crimes. In addition, she knew who was responsible, Karlin was. She would blast him sending him to be with his evil brothers that she destroyed in Jamaica.  The eight witches went to the manor where they had not been in years; nothing had changed being back there. Mystic Shadow was looking through some papers when a cold wind blew past her, she looked around, but she saw nothing. She walked slowly around the room feeling it again and the curtains began to blow, but they were actually closed and there were not any windows open for a draft to move them. She stood still trying to sense a presence when in a quick flash Fredrick was standing in front of her. She jumped not expecting it to be her father.  “Damn it! Can you just make a normal appearance!” she yelled at him.  “You haven’t even sent me a father’s day card.” He told her as he looked as if he were pouting with his hands on his hips. “You’re not very happy to see me considering the last time I saw you when you got married.” He told her walking to the window looking out at the grounds.  She looked at him strangely.” you watched me get married?” she asked him almost shocked.  “Yes, I didn’t make an appearance for fear of ruining your day, but you were quite beautiful Cheyenne.” He told her. “Is that my grand daughter?” he asked pointing at Mystic caster.  “Yes and don’t be going scaring her either.” She told him.  “She looks just like you.” He told her as he watched his grand daughter walking around the grounds.  “What have you been up to?” she asked sensing sadness about him.  Fredrick did not turn around for fear she would see the tears in his eyes. “Oh just ghostly things, you know.” He told her clearing his voice. “I have missed you, all of you know.” He told her keeping his head turned.  “I know I am sorry, I promise to visit more often, I promise. “She told him feeling bad for being neglectful to him.  Fredrick turned around smiling. “Well a father can’t ask for much more then that now, can he?” he asked with a huge smile for he was feeling better now.  Karlin was watching a young waitress with short brown hair, very thin and of Spanish descent. He used his charm on her making her his next victim. He stayed until closing, he persuaded the young girl who was only eighteen- years- old to let him take her home.  The girl believing he was a kind gentle man let him take her home.  “Could I bother you for a cup of coffee?” he asked smiling very charming.  “Of course you may for your being so nice to me tonight.” She told him as they went up to her apartment.  As they stood in the kitchen, he touched her face softly with his fingertips, “why don’t you change into something more comfortable. “He told her smiling as his fingers ran softly down the side of her face to the side of her neck, she smiled at him, and his touch was almost intoxicating to her.  She excused her self to go change into something more comfortable. When she came back, she was wearing a pair of loose shorts with just a white tank top, not bothering to cover her small breast with a bra. He walked up to her gently taking her chin into his hand then kissing her softly. She did not fight him, he took her in his arms kissing her passionately, feeling her responding to his kisses he placed his hand over her breast and again she did not stop him.  “I am going to have sex with you now.” He told her kissing her neck and lifting her in his arms. He carried her to her bedroom, placing her gently on the floor and watched her undress slowly. Her movements were almost sensual. He disrobed and walked slowly to her, picking her up in his arms he made passionate love to her on the bed for hours. She never had a man to make her feel so sensual and free about her body before. She did not want it to end. He lay on top of her pleasuring her and then he began to suck her air out of her lungs. She began to struggle, she tried to scream but she could not break the suction his mouth had formed on hers. He began to become violent in his love making as he literally sucked the oxygen from her body. Her eyes were bulging from their sockets. Her soul entered into his mouth. He got up off her dead body, smiling he turned her to dust with his hands. He vanished from the room laughing at his conquest.  Mystic caster and Mystic Shadow both showed up in the girl’s room only to find a pile of dust in her bed. Their vision did not come until she felt in fear of her life. Unfortunately, that was towards the end of her sexual encounter with him. The women looked at the bed feeling they had let the girl down in protecting her from evil. There wasn’t anything else they could do for her now. They found a phone booth downstairs of her apartment, they told the police they heard screaming from her apartment, the police would have to determine what the dust was in her bed then notify her family so they would have closure of her death. They returned to the manor unaware that Karlin was sitting on top of a building watching them. He smiled for he was very proud that he defeated them in protecting the innocent girl.  The eight witches sat around the table in the kitchen of the manor discussing that night, they knew she had to feel safe until the very end when he killed her.  “She did not feel any fear from him and when we got the vision she had already been turned to dust.” Cheyenne told the witches.  “So how will we capture him?” Gloria asked.  “We could summon him, but he is a very powerful warlock it might not work.” Mystic caster told them.  “Maybe a spell to lead us to him then.” Tammy said as she bit into an apple.  “We can try, but he more then likely has himself blocked from spells that can track him.” Cheyenne told her as she thought to her self.  Karlin found another victim this time a twenty five year old model he was posing as a scout looking for fresh faces for his lay out he was doing on swimwear. He made an appointment to meet her at the office he had rented, using his magic he made the beach scenery with professional cameras large fans to have her long blond hair blowing as if it were the wind. He had her to model a gold bikini with the top shaped into shells, the bottom was gold with hardly any material covering her. Karlin a very lustful warlock enjoyed snapping pictures of her lying on her side on a black beach towel with her one hand holding up her hair looking at the camera seductively. Her eyes were green and they looked as if they always sparkled.  “Would you like to stop for lunch? My treat.” He told her smiling so charming.  “Alright that sounds great.” She told him smiling. He helped her up off the towel, his hand moved to her waist.  “since we have the beach setting why don’t I go pick up something and we could have a picnic, what do you say?” he asked as he still did not move his hand.  “Great I will be waiting here for you to return.” She told him smiling she felt his hand pull her a little closer to him.  “I think it will be the lunch of a life time for you.” He told her as they were now only inches away from one another. He kissed her forehead then left.  He was only gone ten minutes when he returned with wine, strawberries cheese, some rotisserie chicken and a pasta salad.  “I wasn’t sure what you liked, so I guessed.” He said smiling at her magnificent body that he could not wait to take in more ways then one.  He fixed their plates leaving the strawberries for last to be fed to each other. They drank the wine and ate the plates of food. Leaning on his side having her lay next to him he fed her, a strawberry. She bit it off very slowly then she fed him one. He leaned over her turning her on her back kissing her softly, feeling her retuning his advances. He untied her bathing suit top revealing her nice rounded breast. He removed his clothing then removed her bathing suit bottoms. He kissed her then licked her cleavage, slowly running his tongue over her hardened nipples, going down her stomach. He began to perform oral sex on her; he felt her body responding to him. He entered her giving her such pleasures. Her breathing became heavy, his kisses were passionate as well as his touch. He began sucking her air out of her lungs, her eyes opened wide and searching. They were full of fear. She tried to fight him off her, but she could not stop his attack on her. He successfully sucked her dry of oxygen and her soul. He exploded with such an orgasm.  “You were quite a lover my dear.” Whispering in her ear as he raised himself off her dead body. Smiling down at her lying there lifeless, he blasted her to grains of dust. His laughter was sinister and his eyes glowed purple just before he vanished.  Once again, they were too late; they saw the pile of dust. “Damn you Karlen!” Cheyenne cried out for again an innocent person had to die because of evil.  He was truly enjoying torturing the witches for they were unable to stop him again. “Better luck next time ladies.” He said laughing as he vanished from across the street where he stood watching them.  The women went back to the manor again defeated. Cheyenne went to the room opening the book of spells when she found one that might just work. To be able to look through his eyes. She began to chant the spell.  “I Mystic Shadow High Priestess of the white light cast this spell to see through the eyes of the warlock Karlen, preventing another innocent from his evil charm, to prevent them from his harm. Releasing the souls and powers of the ones he has captured.” She chanted when she saw a beautiful woman with long red hair, brown eyes, very built. She was laughing as they were talking.  “I did it! I see his victim!” she yelled as the others came into the room.  “How mother?” Mystic caster asked as her mothers eyes looked strange when she saw the woman he was talking to.  “I cast a spell to see through his eyes. They are going to go out on a date he’s writing down her address quick write down what I tell you.” She told them.” 5854 Yuga way street 8pm tonight Nancy.” She said closing her eyes. “reverse the spell I have just made so I no longer see this vile creatures vision give me back mine making his fade away.” She chanted that when she opened her eyes she was able to see again.  “We should wait until he has her in the bed then we all go in vanquishing him.” Cheyenne told the witches.  At seven o’clock the witches were ready to go, they waited outside of her house as they projected themselves as invisible when they saw him appear at the front door with a dozen roses. They watched them eating dinner, and sipping wine. When dinner was done, they walked into the bedroom, through the shadows on the curtain they could tell they were disrobing then the lights went off.  “Let’s go do it.” Cheyenne told the seven witches.  When they appeared in the room the couple were not in the bed as they expected.  “Surprise you miserable bitches “Karlin told them leaning against the dresser directly behind them. The woman who turned out to be his assistant was standing in front of the door as Karlin began to move towards Mystic Shadow.  “Well if it’s not the bitch Mystic Shadow.” He said with hate for her in his eyes and voice.  The three warlocks showed up with Lightening caster.” Surprise your self asshole.” Fierce caster told him.  Karlin looked at the three warlocks laughing and threw a butcher knife hitting Cheyenne in the chest. She fell to the ground. Murkcaster ran to her as Mystic caster looked at her mother lying there with a knife in her chest.  “Mother! Oh God no!” she cried out seeing her mother laying there.  “Your God can’t save you bitch!” he yelled as he through knives at all the witches using his magic.  “You missed moron!” Mystic caster told him as she began to spin around and around then shooting bolts of lightening at him.  Murkcaster picked up Cheyenne in his arms.” don’t you leave us now.” He told her as they vanished taking her to Aggatha.  Aggatha looked at her beloved grand daughter with the dagger sticking out of her chest.” go the others need you more.” She told him removing the weapon from her heart.  Murkcaster reappeared behind the warlock with the dagger he used to kill Mystic Shadow.” Say good bye asshole.” He told Karlin slitting his throat. The blood poured from his throat then stabbed him in his heart letting him fall to the floor as Mystic caster blew him up. She vanquished him as well making sure he never returned. The other witches turned to his assistant.” You little witch of hell go meet your maker!” Tammy told her blowing her up.  “How is mother?” Mystic caster asked her father with tears in her eyes.  Murkcaster had tears in his eyes, slowly he shooed his head slowly. He tried to speak, but his voice cracked.” She was dead… your grand mother told me to come back here. She was working on her when I left.” He said crying taking his daughter into his arms as they cried together.  The others stood silent not wanting to believe she was gone from them for good. They watched Murkcaster holding his daughter  A tear dropped from fierce caster’s eye. “She has not left us. She has beaten worse then him.” Fierce caster cried out as more tears ran down his face. He vanished to go be with Mystic Shadow.  “Come on let’s go, we did our work here. Let’s go to our fallen sister.” Tammy said as they all disappeared to be with Mystic shadow.  Aggatha was kneeling over Mystic Shadow’s lifeless body and Fierce caster held her running his fingers through her hair softly.  Aggatha was praying for the life to return to her precious grand daughter. “Please don’t let us be too late for her.” She prayed as she had her hands laid on her chest praying for healing. “Oh merciful Higher Power, please give me the power to put the life back into Mystic Shadow’s body with the help of your healing doves.” She said holding her blood soaked hands over Mystic Shadow’s knife wound. Two white doves appeared creating a bright glow around her body and the wound disappeared. “Thank you father.” She said as Mystic Shadow opened her eyes and the doves disappeared.  Mystic caster ran to her mother kneeling next to Fierce caster.” Oh mother, I thought I would never be able to hug you again.” She cried into her mothers arms.  Murkcaster looked away at the sight of Fierce caster holding his wife.” Welcome back Mystic Shadow.” Fierce caster told her smiling with a sparkle in his eyes.  Mystic Shadow smiled up at Fierce caster and her daughter. “I had four great healers.” she smiled looking at Aggatha.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 17 by Erotica_Writings ©  Six month’s after Mystic caster’s birth she was able to levitate objects to her that she wanted, mostly the objects that sparkled. Mystic Shadow when she was not training building her body back up she was teaching her daughter how to use her powers with more coordination so her teddy bears and rattles would not hit the lamps and so forth.  Murkcaster, Light caster and fierce caster were trying to locate a den of demons when Mystic Shadow vanished in the middle of her conversation with Aggatha. Aggatha feared some how an evil source had taken her, but to where she did not know when a vision come to her for the very first time. She saw her grand daughter in a dark den only lit flaming torches as the demon Warmonger who was one of the most powerful of all held her tied to a wall. He was warning her that if she used any of her powers he could also bring her daughter to him to eat. Aggatha ran to the High council to tell them that the very demons and Warlocks they were tracking had Mystic Shadow.  “They said if she used any of her powers they would take the child too.” Aggatha told them as she held the baby in her arms.  “Send for Murkcaster immediately and place her in the birthing room, we will enclose her so nothing evil can enter or use any of their evil powers to get the child.” The eldest High council ordered.  The child was placed in the room with Aggatha and Norma then the spell was cast.   Mystic Shadow was tied to the wall, she saw her child in the glass room knowing that evil could not get to her.  “Hey assholes.” She said as they were preparing the bed where they were going to rape and kill her.  “You dare talk to me that way?” warmonger asked as his eyes were glazing red, he had horns sticking out of his forehead and his ears were large and pointed. He walked to her on his hoofed feet as his long tail swung back and forth. Taking his long razor like nail to slit her shirt open she broke free changing into her warrior uniform.  “Don’t you ever touch me you over grown troll!” she yelled as she threw him up against the wall with her powers. The other demons charged at her and she blew them up with one glance at them. She noticed Warmonger trying to bring the child to him. “um moron, excuse me, but my child is safe where you can’t get to her, I think its time you learned you don’t piss me off!” she said as her body began to spin faster and faster hitting him in his stomach cutting him into then blowing him up.  Murkcaster and the other warlocks appeared in the den. She looked at them smiling.” Its ok I took care of your light weight work.” She told them smiling and hugged Murkcaster then the other two, Fierce caster held slightly longer then Murkcaster or Light caster.  They appeared back at the palace where the baby was being kept. The High Council looked at Mystic Shadow.” How did you know she was safe to attack them as you did?” they asked her as they were confused.  “My little girl showed me that you had made her secured so I could vanquish them.” She explained to them.” How did you know I vanquished them? By a vision that played for you like a movie?” she asked holding her daughter in her arms kissing her.  “Yes. The child is capable of those powers at a young age and knows how to use them?” they asked looking at the child in disbelief of how powerful she will be when she is grown.  “She’s known how to use those powers since she was in my womb.” She told them holding her up over her head blowing on her belly making her laugh when she saw a plastic bottle making it fly and hitting fierce caster in the shoulder with it then giggling.  “Yep she is Mystic Shadow made over.” He said picking the bottle up when the baby drew him over to her like a magnet crying for him to take her where she laid her tiny little head on his shoulder.   “True female, beat me and then love me.” He said hugging her as his eyes were tearing up knowing the child loved him .I’ll protect her with my life he thought to himself.  “we have decided that with her powers we need to move you to another place with new identities and appearances, if they could just take Mystic Shadow out of here like they did then what would stop them from doing the same thing with the child?” they asked them.  “Where would she be safe?” Mystic Shadow asked the council.  Winema appeared.” The child is magical and already is displaying this ability; we should take her to where the warrior’s of the white light dwell. You would not have to hide her magic and still be able to do your work while she is being taken care of by Aggatha and Norma plus one or more warrior to protect her. ” She told them.  When they arrived, it was like a fairy tale, everything was so white and shined like crystals, there were colorful gardens blooming all over. They walked to what looked like a tiny cottage until they walked in to see this huge house with marble flooring, a golden winding stair case, the furniture was of white silk and satin , golden tables . There were crystal wind chimes hanging in the windows. Winema decorated the nursery in pinks and lavenders. Stuffed animals hanging from the ceiling, and sitting in the corners of the room. Tiny fairies lit her room at night like a night light. Mystic caster would watch them twinkle until she fell to sleep at night.  Mystic Shadow cast a spell on her so she could not see her when she was out doing whatever she had to do to stop evil. The next day the six witches went out in search of a serial killer who had agreed to share his body with a demon killing and raping women. The men had to go find five evil witches who were actually burning men of the ancestors of the Salem witch killings.  The women went back to using their human names Cheyenne turning her appearance of those who he has killed red hair, green eyes, very busty with petite body’s, wearing as little clothes the better. That night they went to one of the local clubs in Tampa where most of the women were last seen alive. Cheyenne went in first as if she did not know the others. Heads were turning in her direction when she walked in wearing a tight fitting black dress with long sleeves, cut very short, with a plunging neckline exposing her well-rounded bust. She sat at a small table up against the wall so the other witches could watch her.  A huge man with dark brown hair, brown eyes, dressed in blue jeans, black shirt and cowboy boots.” Could I get you to dance this slow dance with me?” he asked looking at her breast not at her eyes.  “Sure you look big and strong; I’ll bet you move very well.” She told him looking at him seductively.  Out on the dance floor he held her so he could have a great view of her breast. He began rubbing her back than letting his hand touch her ass. She heard him breathing heavy, she turned her back to him, and he held her against him. She moved her body sexually against his. He moved his hands up her sides and under her breast.   Another huge man dressed all in black came up to him. “Pick some one else to dance with, I want this one.” he said taking her away from the other man. She felt an electric charge go through her as he pulled her close to his body. “Lets dance .” he told her holding her tight against his body that felt rock hard, he had a mustache that touched both sides of his chin, his eyes were black as night, his hair was short and it was slicked back. He moved his hands up and down her back. “Let me buy you a drink.” He told her smelling her hair.  “Fine a soda, I don’t drink.” She told him as they went to her table where he ran his hand up her thigh. “I have to go to the rest room, I’ll be right back.” She said motioning for the other women to follow her using her eyes to motion to them.  They were all in the rest room when he slipped a drug in her drink to cause her to pass out. Cheyenne returned to the table letting the others know she believed this was the guy because of the electrical charge she received when he touched her. She drank her soda and began to feel strange.  “I think I need some fresh air,” she told him getting up from the table. He got up to.  “I’ll go with you.” he told her putting his arm around her so no one would notice she was not walking straight.  Just as he closed the door, she passed out from the drug. He lifted her in his arms.” I am going to enjoy you tonight.” He told her looking down at her then they vanished.  The six other witches waited just a few minutes to give them time to get in his car; they walked out to find them gone. They became alarmed knowing he had her alone. They tried casting a spell to track her but it did not work.  “The spell she cast so Mystic caster could not see her has also blocked us.” Tammy told the other women. “We need to go see Aggatha and see if she knows what to do.” She said as then vanished.  The huge man laid her on the bed as he removed his clothing then began to cut Cheyenne’s clothes off her. He lay next to her touching her body all over. He became sexually aroused and raped her as she was past out. The demon took over, the mans features had become hideous looking. “Wake up bitch!” He ordered her in a demonic voice as the drug began to ware off her. The demon was raping her.  Her vision was blurry, she could not focus. Oh, God they drugged me! She thought to herself as she could feel his disgusting body on hers. She knew until the drug wore off completely she wasn’t any match for them. She would have to go along with them or they could kill her until the other witches arrived to help her. She began moving her body as if she was enjoying it.  “you like it do you bitch?” he asked as he licked her neck ramming her body harder.” Ride me you whore!” he ordered her.  She did as he told her. She wondered what was taking the other witches so long in getting to her. Her vision had cleared and an hour had gone by. She felt a little groggy, but she moved her body seductively on top of him.  “Am I pleasuring you as you like?” she asked leaning over forcing herself to kiss him without being sick.  “Shut up whore!” he yelled  Finally, she felt like herself again, she saw the long knife they used to slit the girls bodies open while they were alive. Cheyenne suddenly rose up off him spinning in the air and changing into her warrior clothes. At the same time, the other witches were able to locate her by Winema.  “Hey ass hole! You like slicing women alive? See how you like it.” Cheyenne yelled having the knife slicing him open as he screamed out in pain. The demon jumped out of his body and the other witches vanquished him. Cheyenne was angry with the man for raping her and the other women they raped and killed. She looked at him with a smug smile. “Prison is too good for you, but this isn’t.” she said blowing him up in the bed and they vanished.   Back at the cottage, she was glad to be back at home as she played with her daughter in the gardens.  The men had tracked down the five witches who were staying just outside of Salem where they would act as writers writing on the Salem witch killings wanting to interview the male ancestors who actually had part in it by killing them. They would stop their bloodlines from continuing on by their deaths. The men appeared where they were staying taking them by surprise for they had a man tied to a pole in their backfield. They had set him on fire burning him alive.  Expecting the witches to use magic against them they were surprised when they didn’t.  “If your witches why don’t you use you’re magic to save yourselves?” Murkcaster asked them as he held them up in the air.  “We’re not magical witches, we’re human white witches.” She explained fearing for her life.” what are you?” she asked as her friends were being tied by magical rope.  “We are the true white light warlocks and you are giving us a bad image by your evil deeds for white witches are not evil.” Fierce caster said.  Murkcaster tied the woman up.” were your ancestors killed in the witch hunt?” he asked her trying to figure out the killings.  “No not one of our relatives was, we were just revenging the women who died." The one answered. They all had long black hair wearing black clothing and black make up.  ” You just killed to kill! It was not even your battle!” he told them feeling anger building in side of him.  “How is it yours? You just leave us alone!” One of the women told him angrily.  “It is our battle, we protect the innocent from evil and you just killed an innocent man! You must pay the price for doing the work for evil.” He told them as the warlocks vanished and telepathically told the detective where he could find the Salem killers they had been tracking.  When the detective arrived with other officers, the women were babbling that warlocks had tied them up, but there weren’t any ropes holding them. The warlocks told them they would make them suffer for killing the men.  The officers looked at the women standing before the man they had just killed.” Ladies don’t even try the insanity plead, your just cold blooded killers.” They told them taking them into custody.  The women were sentenced to five counts of life in prison without parole.  Lilly Phillips, a twenty – year - old woman who was not attractive, she was very obese, her hair was short and black; she had a low self-esteem. She was thrilled when she had become involved with the demon zurlock; he used her for his pleasures, to commit crimes for him. He would have women come to the house he shared with Lilly. They would sexually pleasure him; he would only have sex with her when he thought she might be slipping out of his control. She was unaware that he was a real supernatural demon and not a normal big muscular bald black man that she thought wanted her. He had other ideas for her since he was out to avenge his twin brother Gore warrior. He planned to bring down the warriors of the white light. He had specially planned how he was going to take care of Mystic Shadow, he thought of how he was going to have her in ways that Gore warrior never have dreamt of before ripping her heart out of its chest cavity. He looked at Lilly; he was becoming aroused by the thought of Mystic Shadow for his slave.  “Come here now.” He told her as he unzipped his pants.” Pleasure me.” He told her transforming her appearance of Mystic Shadow instead of Lilly being the one pleasuring him. His eyes glared red holding her head down so she could not see his face turning into the demonic creature he actually was. After he had been pleasured, he kept her appearance of Mystic Shadow that only he could see. He took her in his arms then ripped her clothes off. He shoved her face first into the wall pushing his body against hers as he ran his hands over her body getting aroused again. “Tell me you’re my slave.” He told her living his fantasy out of Mystic Shadow through Lilly.  “I am your slave .” she told him, she was afraid of him he had never acted in this manner, but she could not resist the way he was making her body feel.  He kissed her back, caressed her breast, then threw her on the bed and began the most brutal sexual attack on her. He bit into her flesh with his fang like teeth. She saw for the first time the monster inside of her body with his face so demonic looking. Lilly screamed a blood-curdling scream, but then as always she accepted the fact that no man wanted her except for this creature and she should be thankful.  “Give me your body to pleasure mine as my slave for eternity.” He whispered in her ear.  “Oh yes, yes.” She answered thinking he really desired her. Her reply drove him more insane with his obsession for Mystic Shadow.  “Mystic shadow, Mystic shadow!” he cried out as he exploded in a hot steamy orgasm.  She looked at him.” Who is Mystic Shadow?” she asked angrily as she got out of bed.  He looked at her.” You fat ugly bitch! Who are you to ask me questions? You are lucky that I would even touch you! Look in the mirror and you will see who I was fucking! It has never been you.” He said as she looked at the stranger in the mirror who was beautiful, with a luscious body running her hands over the large breast.  “Please don’t change me back; I’ll be your Mystic Shadow.” She told him not wanting to go back to her own looks.  He laid there smiling as the thought pleased him, at least until he got the real thing.” Come here Mystic shadow and show me how thankful you are for that body and face.” He said smiling at her.  She walked over to him and performed oral sex on him.  The next few days she was thrilled with the looks and whistles she received from men on the streets. She went shopping buying sleazy clothes for her new body to attract more attention from men. This began to bother Zurlock for he wanted no other man to touch his recreation of Mystic Shadow. He grabbed her as she was getting ready to go out.  “You allow any other man to touch you and I will kill you.” He told her as he held her against the wall choking her.  “No one will touch me but you.” She told him afraid of losing her new looks.  Once out on the street she saw a bar deciding she would go inside. Men were coming up to her buying her drinks. One very handsome man caught her eye with a deep tan, he was tall with blond hair, blue eyes, he wore a pair dark blue dress pants with a light blue shirt. She walked over to the bar stool wearing a white top that laced up the back, low cut V neck line with long sleeves, a short white skirt lacing up the sides exposing her flesh, wearing a white thong and white sandals. He watched her as she sat next to him.  “Hello there Miss America!” he said looking at her body up and down.” what would you like to drink?” he asked her, she was the one he would be taking home tonight.  The more drinks he poured into her the more she let him kiss on her rubbing her thighs.” lets go back to your place.” He told her as he kissed her neck.  “I can’t go there… not with you.” She told him wanting him so bad.  “Husband huh? I have a wife, but as luck would have it I have a large front seat in my truck.” He said smiling as they finished their drinks.  Once inside the truck he laid her down putting his hands under her shirt causing her to moan, knowing he had to be home soon he took her body with force. He began to see what she truly looked like. He quickly got off her.  “Get out of my truck you freak!” he told her pushing her out of the truck.  She looked in his side mirrors seeing her face. “Oh no he turned me back to my hideous self!” She cried running home. She looked even more hideous in the outfit that was busting away from her body. She walked into the house to find him waiting for her.  “The looks were for me! Did you think I would not put a condition to you keeping her looks? Do you think I would trust you not to let some other man touch her body?” he asked as he hit her so hard across the face knocking her to the ground.” She was only for my pleasure!” he yelled kicking her in the side of her body.  She was crying so hard her bottom lip that was big and deformed looking began to quiver. “I am sorry! Please you have to believe me! I am sorry! Please forgive me? ” she asked crying and begging him. She was not mentally there to begin with. She sat up on her knees with her hands together looking up at him like a naughty child.  She angered him even more, he took his foot that he wore black army boots kicking her so hard under the chin that it lifted her up off the ground. She landed on her back where he began kicking her in her head repeatedly until she blacked out. He continued this assault on her unconscious body until he came up with the idea of creating an evil clone of Mystic Shadow who would cause chaos amongst the innocents that the white light defend. He waited until she woke up she was bloody and battered from his beating.  “I will make you an offer that it will be hard to pass up.” he told her as she was groggy and sore from his abuse.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 17 by Erotica_Writings ©  “What is it?” she asked afraid of angering him again.  “Would you give your soul to evil to stay looking like her all of the time?” he asked her as she got to her feet.  “You mean no matter what I do I would never lose the beauty and desire of other men?” she asked as this sounded to good to be true.  “Yes you turn your soul over and you will permanently look like Mystic Shadow for eternity.” He told her smiling knowing she would do anything to have the beauty she had for a few days. “You tell me that you want to give your soul to the dark side, to be able to look like Mystic Shadow.” He told her placing his hand on her shoulder as he stood in front of her.  “Yes, I will give my soul to the dark side to look like Mystic Shadow.” She told him.  “Even if it meant you would have to die to come back looking exactly as Mystic Shadow?” he asked her.  She thought for a moment to come back beautiful for eternity.  ” It would be eternity right? I would look like her no matter what I did or with who I did it with?” she asked him.  “What ever you do, and who ever you do it with you will always look as her. The only difference is you will be the evil one.” He told her smiling.  “Yes I would die if I would always look like her.” She told him.  “And you would serve evil at all cost.” he asked making sure she did not try to get out of it.  “Yes I would serve evil with all my heart to be beautiful, desired and having men lust for me. Yes.” She told him.  “Ok get ready to come back as the evil Mystic Shadow.” He told her cutting her throat watching her gurgling blood until she was dead.  He disposed of the body and waited for the evil Mystic Shadow to return. Together they would destroy the warriors of the white light.  A few days had gone by and there was a knock at the door; he walked to the door opening it slowly when he saw the new evil Mystic Shadow wearing a see through black top, a very short tight black skirt, with black spiked heels.  “You look just like her.,” he said checking out her body, he was happy it worked right to every small detail.  “They told me to tell you this was the best you have come up with.” She told him kissing him. She ran her tongue around his lips.  “Do you want something?” he asked as he reached up her skirt feeling her ass and pushing her up against the erection he was getting.  She pushed him back into the room. ”Look at what I can do.” She said using magic to change into the duplicate warrior’s outfit of Mystic Shadow. ”and I can also do this too.” She said stripping him of his clothes. She smiled at him then vanished both of their clothes.” Now come here and let’s see what we can do to pleasure each other.” She told him walking to the bed where they spent hours in an almost sexual ritual. Lillie being unaware that her beauty disappears as she reaches her sexual climax revealing her true self-appearance that is more hideous than those she was born with. Her face turns into a demonic creature with horns, long fangs used to kill her mortal victim. Long pointed ears, and scraggily, balding hair. It was during the climax of their sexual celebration that she saw her true self in the mirror.  ” No! This cannot be! You lied to me! I look hideous and disgusting! You told me I would always look like Mystic Shadow!” She screamed at him looking at the monster she had become.  “What did you expect that you were going to be made beautiful with out there being any type of conditions?” he asked getting angry.  “You never told me of any conditions! when I agreed to give my soul to the dark side, you never told me I would look like this!” she yelled at him.  “You may have changed in looks, but you’re still just as stupid as the ugly fat bitch you were. You are made this way to collect more souls to the dark side by killing them with the kiss of death which are your fangs.” He told her.  “So I am a vampire?” she asked him even more confused.  “You’re a demon, but you will suck their blood from their bodies.” He told her.  “So I am a demon vampire.” She said watching as her beauty came back.  “Yeah something like that.” He told her as he got out of the bed.  “So when I suck their blood do they become one of us?” she asked him as he looked at her beautiful nude body.  “only if they agree to give their soul to the dark side to get what they want and most men will agree to give you their soul just to sleep with you.” He said smiling. He knew men would tell a woman anything to get her in bed.  She went to take a long hot shower to get ready for tonight. Collecting the souls to please the dark side. She wore a long tight skirt slit up to her waist on each side, white satin thongs, and a white see through halter-top that tied in the back with thin strings. Being able to see most of her breast, a pair of opened toe spiked heels that laced up around her calves. She put her make up on heavy with a sweet smelling perfume. Walking out to the living room where he stood dressed in a black tight fitting shirt, black dress slacks and black dress shoes he looked at her.  “If we didn’t have work to do I would take you right now and make you howl in pleasure.” He said grinning looking at her hard nipples.  “Let’s go and play.” She told him walking past him.  “Man they did excellent work on that ass.” He said as they walked out of the apartment.  As they walked into the club down the street she sat next to a huge white man whose head was shaved bald, he wore a white pull over shirt, kacky green slacks with brown cowboy boots. She smiled at him as he looked over her body.   “Can I buy you a drink?” he asked as he was looking at her bare thigh leading to her waist.” My name is Sam. “  “Sex on the beach Sam.” She told him turning her bar stool facing him so he could see her breast through the shirt.” Hello Sam, I am Mystic Shadow.” She told him placing her hand on his thick thighs.  “Would you like to dance?” he asked her. He thought about having her body against him.  “Yes I would very much like to dance.” She told him taking his hand as he led her to the dance floor.  Her arms wrapped around his neck, he could feel her rub her nipples against his chest. He ran his hands over her perfect rounded ass squeezing it, he let one hand rub up and down her hip as he directed her body into a dark corner where he began kissing her as she licked his lips and sucking on his tongue. Her hand rubbed the erection in his pants; she slightly opened her legs so his hand could find her moistness.  “I want you baby.” He told her getting sexually aroused.  They fondled each other in the corner; he was ready to take her right there.  “And what are you willing to give me?” she asked as he ran his hands under her shirt feeling her breast.  “Anything what do you want?” he asked her as he was being driven crazy with desire.  “Give me your soul then.” She told him smiling up at him playfully.  “You got it baby, let’s go somewhere.” He told her leading her out of the bar and going to her place down the street.  Zurlock smiled he knew there would be another soul added to the dark side tonight. “Another whiskey please? “ He asked the bartender.  Once inside of her place the man took off his clothes and lay on the bed. He watched her take off her clothes, then sliding her body on top Of his. She sat on top of him as he caressed her breast.  “Are you still going to give me your soul to keep?” She asked him taking him deep inside of her, she moving her hips slowly.  “Yes, yes my soul is yours.” he said, as he had never had such pleasure as she licked his chest, then neck. She became aroused rising up she had transformed back into her natural demon self. He looked up at her face; he was horrified and screamed out a blood-clenching scream. She bit into his neck when she reached her climax adding another soul to the dark side.  “Welcome aboard.” She told him as he laid there dead with his blood dripping down her face.  Zurlock came inside to see she did her job well and helped to dispose of the body. Once again, they went to another club where one of the warriors of the white light stark caster was there. He saw Mystic Shadow with Gore warrior who he thought had been vanquished. He watched as they separated and she sat next to a thin black man. He was shocked when she was trying to seduce him letting him touch her thigh; she leaned over whispering in his ear then licking it. They went out on the dance floor where the man was all over her body until they left the bar together. He felt something was very wrong as he watched Gore warrior stayed behind. He decided he had to go report this to Murkcaster. The warrior appeared at the cottage where he saw Mystic Shadow playing in the garden with her daughter who was now three years old. He was even more confused walking up to her.  “I just saw you at the club Rockers with Gore warrior, but yet you’re here.” He told her looking even more confused then ever.  “Well I am here, so whoever you saw was not me.” She told him looking at him strangely.  “She left with a black man, but not with Gore warrior, he waited there.” He told her trying not to sound crazy.  Mystic Shadow knew it could not be Gore warrior; he was not in existence anywhere. “Tell Murkcaster, maybe he should go check it out.” She told him knowing that people looking like her and Gore warrior together was just too much of a coincidence.  The warriors went to check out what Stark caster claimed to see. They watched Gore warrior dancing with a sexy looking blonde-haired woman; they could not believe he was able to come back.   “Let’s keep an eye on him.” Murkcaster told Light caster and fierce caster knowing he himself witness Fierce caster vanquish him.  Mystic Shadow had the man on her bed pleasuring him. ”tell me what are you going to give me?” she asked as she moved her hips slowly on top of him feeling how much he was enjoying her body.  “My soul, my soul…damn just keep giving me that hot body.” he told her, he was getting ready to explode into a climax and watched as she transformed back into demon Lillie, she bit into his neck. The man could not scream or move he was paralyzed with fear as she drained his blood from his body.  The warriors followed Gore warrior back to the apartment building. They watched in disbelief as he and Mystic Shadow got rid of the man’s body. Murkcaster summoned for the real Mystic Shadow who saw for herself the imposter of her. This angered her; she transformed her appearance of a sexy blonde-haired female wearing a red dress that showed every curve of her body with a very low cut neckline exposing her cleavage, with red matching heels.   Murkcaster looked at her.” Maybe you could do that for me in the bedroom some night?” he asked smiling.  “Only if you will look like someone else for me.” She said smiling looking at knight shadow.  “Hey don’t bring me into this.” He told them as he watched the two demons going into another club.” they are really making their rounds tonight. “He said as they followed the two demons into the club.  “I will take the Gore warrior look alike, and you guys take on my double. who really wears to much make up to be me.” She said spotting Zurlock on the other side of the bar. She walked up to him and sat next to him at the bar.  “Hi my name is Cinnamon and you are one handsome man.” She said smiling at him.  “My name is Zurlock and you look like you could use a drink.” He told her smiling.  “Zurlock that is an unusual name.” she told him knowing it was Gore warrior’s twin demonic brother and he was too stupid to use a different name.  “My parents weren’t from around here.” He told her looking at her cleavage.” what can I buy you to drink?” he asked her again as he visualized taking her to bed.  “I will have just a soda thank you.” She told him as he moved closer to her chair. He placed his hand on her thigh when she had a vision of him changing Lillie a very unattractive woman into her; she was able to see the deal he made to her for her soul.    “You are one gorgeous woman and I would love to take you on a pleasure trip.” He told her.  She smiled at him.” why don’t you pleasure this.” She said as she transformed into Mystic Shadow, in full warrior uniform. “You piece of shit!” she said blowing him up and freezing everyone in the place except for her evil twin.  Lillie stood looking at Mystic Shadow knowing she would have to battle her when the three warriors grabbed her.  “I don’t appreciate women like you imitating my wife.” Murkcaster told her. Mystic Shadow flew up in the air doing three summer salts across the room hitting her evil clone in the head.  “You sold your soul for beauty! You want to be me! You’re going to have to battle me!” she told her standing firmly in front of her.  “That is not a problem.” She told her getting up off the floor wearing Mystic Shadow’s warrior outfit.  Mystic Shadow looked at her now even angrier. ”I Mystic shadow High Priestess of the white light order this Imitation warrior suit of the white light burn yourself off this evil demons flesh for she is loosing this fight.” Mystic Shadow chanted as she waved both of her hands in a criss cross motion.  The suit began to burn the flesh of the demon Lillie as she screamed from the pain. She quickly changed into a black long gown.  “I don’t need a suit for protection to defeat you.” She said throwing a fireball at her.  “Is this the only thing you demons know how to do?” Mystic Shadow asked reflecting the fireball then with one quick movement of her hand she threw Lillie into the bar.  “Now that had to hurt.” Fierce caster said as he watched the demon pick her self up off the floor lunging at Mystic Shadow who leaped high into the air and hitting Lillie with a lightening bolt.  The demon screamed in pain as it burnt half of her face off.  “You bitch! You dare ruin my face!” she yelled as she threw six daggers at Mystic Shadow.  “You are a poor aim and it’s my face asshole!” She told her as she made her fly up into the air hitting the ceiling and crashing down on the floor.  The warriors clapped for Mystic Shadow cheering her on as they enjoyed taunting the demon Lillie, as she lay on the floor in excruciating pain.  “Get up you big bad ass demon! Because I have just started to have fun with your evil vile ass! Creature of evil tricking men into their souls and when I am done revenging their deaths and setting their souls free you’ll regret the day you wanted to be me.” She told her slinging her into the wall of the bar.  Lillie lay motionless as Mystic Shadow walked over to her kicking her in the side. “before I vanquish you I Mystic Shadow High Priestess of the white light give you the new look which truly fits you, the face of a wart hog and the body of an elephant to which you shall carry through eternity neither good nor evil shall ever change this spell.” She chanted as she made a large mirror appear in front of the evil demon Lillie. “As this vain woman chose to trick men out of their souls for beauty, I grant their release through the power of our Higher Power and order this evil demon Lillie’s demise.” She said as the woman blew up into a ball of fire. The club resumed as if nothing had taken place and the warriors vanished.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 16 by Erotica_Writings ©  Mystic Shadow came back to reality from her memories listening to the High Councils words.  "The High Priestess will reside here to protect the pregnancy of our royal couple for when the dark side hears of it they will try to terminate the Childs birth." The High council ordered.  Cheyenne told the council that if she was to stay so must her family. She needed to make sure of their safety as well. The council agreed with one string attached. "One of the witches will have to transform her looks into yours our Highness and be seen around Jamaica so if the evil ones who are watching will consider the pregnancy a rumor when they see her belly is not growing with child." They told her.  "I will do it Cheyenne; I have you down with your movements and your wording down pretty good." She told Cheyenne.  "From now on you all will address our High Priest and High Priestess by their spiritual names. And Mystic Shadow you must give your witch sister's and the warlocks their names." He told her.  "I will just as soon as I think of them." She told him smiling at him.  "Ok Patty let me see me." She said with a strange confusing look.  As Patty moved her hands down her whole body she became Cheyenne's identical twin." Well did it work?" she asked.  "Yes, but we have to dress you like me, your clothing is drab." She told her as she put her in a pair of hip hugging blue jeans, a top that looked as if she took a scarf and put a string of leather around the top to tie it and one sewed in to tie the bottom, with a pair of moccasins. "Let's see you walk." She told her. "Perfect I guess you can start by opening the shop today." Cheyenne told her.  "Ok and I will see you tonight." She said as she vanished.  At the shop being Cheyenne she never realized how many men were always flirting with her. She pulled it off well and she actually flirted back with them as she began to actually feel sexy.  A man came in to the shop as she was bent over picking up a quarter she had dropped on the floor. "Now that is quality merchandise you are equipped with Miss." He said as he watched her round bottom.  Standing up she turned to see the green eyed stranger with black wavy hair, he was tall, and built wearing a pair of white loose fitting jeans and a light blue pull over shirt. "Your not equipped too bad your self." She said smiling.  "Your name?" he asked her.  "My name is Cheyenne." Patty said so natural with a friendly smile.  "Well may I take you to dinner tonight? For you are so beautiful." He said eyeing her body up and down.  Patty knew she had to return back at the palace at night, but she was so taken with him." lunch would be better," she said.  "Great what if I brought it and we locked up the store so we would not be interrupted? He asked running his hand softly down the side of her face, neck and stopping at just before her chest.  "fabulous." she said as she felt the passion growing with in her.  "See you in a little bit." He told her.  When he stepped out of the shop he smiled, she is not Mystic Shadow I can use seduction to find her. If not this imitation will be dead." He smiled as he thought to himself turning down an alley as he transformed into his identity of a demon named Rage curse. His appearance was so freighting grotesque with red glaring eyes, his teeth were sharp and fang like that green slime dripped from his mouth, his body was that of a horrible creature with large wings coming from his back. He had six tails that whipped around his body to enable him to hold his victim, while he ripped them apart with his long razor like nails.  Two hours had past when he arrived back at the shop with a basket of food, they went into the back of the store spreading a blanket out. They sat there sipping on wine, when he pulled her close to him slowly kissing her as he ran his tongue across her lips. He held her chin with his hand looking deep into her eyes." I want to make love to you now." He said kissing her.  "No I can't do that." She told him as she pulled away.  "Yes you can." he told her shoving her backwards kissing her while she struggled to fight him off. He looked down at her." your pissing me off witch now where is the real Mystic Shadow at?" as he turned into his true grotesque form.  Patty began to scream having this foul creature on top of her that not even her magic could defeat. He began to rip open her clothing with his nails.  "Tell me or I will kill you." He told her licking her lips with his snake like tongue, green slime dripping onto her face.  Cheyenne was sitting in her bed when she had a vision of a small child in front of her, a little girl dressed in a white dress with long brown hair and big brown eyes." Go to Patty he is killing her." She told her.  "Who are you?" Cheyenne asked surprised by her vision.  "I am Mystic caster your child. Hurry before it's too late." She told her mother with tears forming in her eyes.  Cheyenne without thinking changed into her warrior clothes then appeared in the shop where Patty was being ripped apart by him.  "Hey asshole why don't you pick on someone your own size?" she asked as she hit him with a bolt of lightening knocking him off Patty. She knew she was too late in saving Patty. "Oh patty." she said looking at her shredded body when she felt his tail wrapping around her.   "I will destroy you and that child you carry." He told her.  Cheyenne began to glow white as she looked at him with rage flowing through every vein and body part. "Fuck you demon reject!" She said as she cut his tails off with one look.  "You bitch!" He screamed out in pain.  "No ass wipe get it right, I am the bitch!" She yelled and with one glance, she blew him up into small pieces.   Cheyenne picked Patty's body up taking her back to the Palace to Aggatha, but she had been dead to long to save her. Cheyenne stood in the middle of the room holding her hands up towards the sky. "Nooooooooo!" She cried out so loud that it echoed through the palace.  Everyone in the palace appeared by Mystic Shadow including the High Council, they heard her cry out in pain due to the loss of her sister Patty who died while protecting her. Murkcaster held her as she cried.  Mystic Shadow looked at the High Council "I order that she is to be placed in the tomb of our highest ranking warriors for she did not give away her High Priestess to save her own Life." She told them looking the High Council in their eyes daring them to defy her orders." Her spiritual name is and always will be Winema a female chief. Her soul which I seized back from Rage curse will be able to soar freely lighting the way for the innocent." She told them as she cried holding her hand over her mouth." Tonight ...at midnight, her ceremony will begin. I want my hand maidens to prepare her body... for she is divine royalty." She told them as she waved her hand over Mystic of light removing the slashes that were made by Rage curse so she looked as she did in life.   Mystic Shadow looked at the High Council." I also order that evil is to be tracked and vanquished instead of waiting for it to strike one of us or the innocent people." She told them.  "You will be ordering a war to begin if you do this Mystic Shadow." The eldest member of the council told her.  "I am Mystic Shadow daughter of our two bravest warriors and you dare question me? Your High Priestess you question?" She asked him standing before him just inches from his face.  "No, no I do not and I am sorry if I seemed out of line." He said very humble.  "We are going to war then aren't we?" she asked him as well as looking at the other council members.  Without hesitation they replied in unison." Yes our High Priestess we are." They told her for they just learned she was not one to back down to evil.  "I want my sister witches, Roger to meet me and Murkcaster in my room. that also includes Grandmother and Norma my mortal sister." She told them as she walked back to the room." and you need to send for Lindsey and John as well. "She told them then vanished to her room.  As they waited for everyone to finish gathering in the room Lindsey and Saunders appeared. Lindsey was in tears. "Aggatha told me what happen to Patty. How can they tell us we are immortal if we can be destroyed?" she asked crying in Saunders arms.  "Well when they made us believe we were Guardian Angels they had to tell us we were immortal, Angels are the souls of the dead that have been chosen to watch over innocents. And that is where I am going with this tonight at the ceremony I am going to make her a guardian angel of the witch's, warlocks and innocents of the white light that represents goodness and she will be able to send the evil souls still roaming this earth into hell's fire. She will also be able to lead us to the evil demons, warlocks, witches and so forth." She explained to them.  "So she will actually still be with us then?" Alicia asked her through her tears.  "Yes, tonight I will ask Our Lord the Higher Power to grant me this request." She told them knowing she could not do it with out permission from above.  This made the destruction of Patty as a witch easier for them to take. "I hope they grant it." Aggatha said with her hands together.  "I want to share with you how I happened to know about Patty, I had a vision, but not of Patty being in danger it was my daughter Mystic caster. She told me to go to Patty that he was killing her. But I was too late." She told them.  "The baby told you?" Aggatha asked." And not your own visions?" Aggatha asked looking dumb founded.  "That's right, and she is beautiful. By her being able to communicate with me at such an early age, she has the powers of my mother, Aggatha, my father and me combined. Remember not only did Murk Shadow place a tiny cut on our hands to mix our blood, but my biological father Fredrick before he be came evil was a very powerful warrior of the white light." She told them.  "The counsel must know this that is why they have you staying here to be protected." Norma told her.  "Well tomorrow we get all of our warriors in shape; they do not look like they make them work out every day keeping the techniques up." Murkcaster told her.  "I want to know why I did not get any vision." She asked summoning the council in the room.  "Why are my visions not working?" she asked.  "For your protection we have placed a spell to stop them Your High Priestess." The elder one told her in a soft voice.  "If you had not done this with out my permission my sister may have been saved." She told them with holding the information of the baby.  "How did you find out by the way?" he asked.  "It's confidential." She told them. "Lift the spell or I will!" She demanded of them.  "But your safety your highness." He told her. "We can not lose this child she is very special." He told her.  "So you know just as I do that she is already powerful, she also knows how important our work is. She warned me that Winema was approaching death!" she yelled at them.  The council stood speechless knowing that the child had just been conceived and is becoming powerful in her mother's womb. This could only be that she has been given all the powers of the highest ranking warriors. "We shall remove the spell as we speak." The elder man told her realizing the child was already a warrior at work.  That night Mystic Shadow and the other witches, Aggatha and Norma wore long black gowns that flowed as they walked, black heels and long black veils. Murkcaster and the other two warlocks wore Black tuxedos, with black dress shoes. They were the first to view their fallen sister; they walked into the room covered in black velvet wallpaper. Pictures of the guardian warriors Encased in Gold framing. There were twinkling lights Winema lay in a glass casket while fairies sprinkled magical dust for her soul's protection. Her hair was prepared in a French twist with small ringlets cascading her face. She had on a diamond necklace that all the great female warriors receive at that burial with matching earrings and a thin diamond bracelet, her gown was long, with layers of white chiffon that resembled what a Greek Goddess would wear, her feet adorned in glass slippers. Candles of purple and black burned around her resting place as a picture of her in her warriors uniform sat up on an altar with white candles burning and oils to be sprinkled on her during the ceremony, two women playing the harps so softly. She looked so angelic laying there so somber in sleep. There was a circle which Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster would stand when Mystic shadow said her sisters prayers and to grant her the wish. The room began to fill with all the good witches, warlock warriors, and all the good creatures of the High Power. Now the ceremony could begin with the high council sat in their high back chairs made of black velour and gold framing behind the altar.  " I Mystic Shadow, High Priestess and Murkcaster High Priest of all that is good are standing in this circle to cherish our brave warrior Winema to be the female chief of the White Light spirit warrior's. To grant us this request so we may help her to take flight. We ask the High Power above for permission to make her soul a mighty warrior. To help in the war of evil, to show us, your warriors her spiritual light so she may guide us to the ones we need to fight. She may collect the stolen souls of the innocent if you would endow on her Father the Guardian of the white light. The light of the witches, warlocks and all of the innocents. Please our mighty Lord, grant our request." She prayed as she and Murkcaster lit candles around the circle, and then the ones left unlit on the altar as they closed the ceremony. As the last candle was lit, a white light glowed so bright around Winema, her soul raised up from her body floating above everyone she looked so beautiful and shined brightly.  "Mystic shadow and Murkcaster your request has been granted and from this moment on our journey begins in destroying evil that lurks on the innocents." She said as she floated around the room so everyone could view their Guardian of the white light.  Tammy was sent to New York city where she was to find Lexter of the dark side, he was the second in charge of the dark side and if she is able she could gain information on the where about of Carnal lover.  She was able to find out that he visited a club often where he could lure women back with him to his dungeon so he could pleasure them as he took over their minds to have them kill, rob or sell drugs. He could control the user of his drugs having them to commit horrendous acts that he placed in their minds telepathically. When she saw him, she knew it was him. Women were hanging all over him. She walked by slowly looking him up and down smiling seductively trying to catch his attention with out succeeding. He was huge in size; his upper arms were the size of basketballs. He looked like a professional wrestler for his body being so built. His black hair was long and braided; he wore a white muscle shirt, with black slacks that fit nicely around his waist, they were cut loose around his thighs. Well this is going to be harder then I thought with all those bimbos throwing their bodies at him. When she thought to herself, maybe if one of is partners in evil tried picking me up and I seem UN touchable by any man in here... maybe I can lure him into my web. She thought as she went into the women's room changing into a silver top with a matching short skirt that was almost transparent, she was braless as her nipples protruded from the top, she wore silver spiked heels that wrapped around her ankles. She cast a spell on her to be irresistible to men so when she sat next to his partner it would drive him crazy. She came out of the rest room seeing that Jester the hacker was all alone, Lexter was not bored with his hand up one blonde-haired woman's skirt. He was enjoying making her climax in front of everyone. He called attention to her by the other men who then carried her into a back room to rape her by six men. Tammy sat shaking her head as she could not stop it or blow her cover and cost her more then a rape, but her life. She sat next to him as she accidentally rubbed her hardened nipples up against his arm." Excuse me." she told him.  He looked her up and down, "baby you can rub those gorgeous breast all over Me." he told her as he touched her back.  "Please don't touch the merchandise, there isn't a man in here who I would rub any part of my body on, much less let them rub me anywhere." She said as she crossed her legs sitting next to him.  Jester taking her bait ran to Lexter and told him of the ice princess. where he immediately went up to her whispering in her ear." You are the most gorgeous creature in here baby." He told her as he rubbed her shoulders.  "Get lost will you please." She told him seeing it was working she got his attention.  "Only if I could get lost deep inside of you." he told her rubbing his hands softly up and down her waist to her hips then turning her chair around facing him as he looked into her eyes unaware he was casting a spell of lust and desire on her. "Now don't you want me between those delicious thighs?" he asked putting his body between her thighs, she desired his touch. She did not try to stop him when he raised her top up exposing her naked breast as he fondled her. "I want the whole bar to watch me melt the ice princess," he yelled out as he unzipped his pants. She lay back in her chair resting her shoulders and arms on the bar allowing him to kiss her and removing her shirt.  Winema watching what was happening went and reported it to Mystic Shadow. She cast a powerful spell breaking his on Tammy and bringing her back.  Tammy realized what happened to her. She cast her own spell while he was involved with performing fore play on her in front of everyone. Her spell made him weak to her beauty. She told him in front of everyone "I wish for my feet to be kissed." She ordered him. He obediently got on his knees. Everyone watched this woman taking control over him. She pushed him away from her suddenly.  " Stop, you no longer interest me." She told knowing he would look like a fool to everyone he had under his control.  Filled with anger he picked her up over his shoulders carrying her to the back where the six men were raping the other female. He ordered them to leave. He threw on the bed and began raping her, but to his surprise, she began to laugh at his attack. This was driving him crazy he had to conquer her. He rolled her on top of him where he ravished her with pleasure; she smiled knowing she was in control of him.  "Come home with me tonight." He asked her touching her face softly as she lay beside him on the bed.  "Alright, perhaps for just a little while though." She told him as they got dressed.  That night back at his apartment it was richly decorated in black leather couches, glass tables with gold and black frames, the lighting were in the edge of the ceiling, he could dim them or make the lights bright. They stood on the balcony over looking the city of New York that looked as if it was twinkling stars from all the lights of the buildings. The bedroom had a large round bed everything designed in leopard spots. They lay in bed after two hours of sex, when he fell to sleep. she cast a spell on his sub conscious asking him questions. She found out where Carnal lover was. Standing up over his bed she purposely woke him up. "Hey ass hole." She said seeing his eyes open up.  " Bye - bye." She said smiling waving good – bye.  "Are you leaving?" he asked half a sleep.  "No you are." She said pouring the vanquishing potion on him. She smiled as his flesh began to smoke than exploded. "See ya!" she said leaving the apartment. She gave Carnal lovers where about to Mystic Shadow once she returned to the palace.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 16 by Erotica_Writings ©  Mystic Shadow sent Roger and other warlocks out to vanquish him.  The guardian of the white light told them she had found out that teen age girls were being tricked into losing their souls on the internet by thinking they were just playing a game. There were fifty game sights set up. "That is a lot of souls stolen." She told her.  That night Mystic Shadow met with the council giving the warriors names. Tammy is now Mystic passion, Alicia Mystic dusk, Gloria Mystic spell, Margaret Mystic curse, Lindsey Mysticlure, even Norma was given her name for she had battled evil too. hers was Mystics mortal. And Aggatha still remained Mystic charm that was handed down to her by her mother.  Back in Mystic Shadow's bedroom, she managed to get a computer set up for her to use. She went on one game site it was called Battle the Dark side or you lose your soul. Mystic Shadow chose to play against the one called the Warlock. He wrote her in an instant message.  "The object of the game was to cast a spell that could vanquish him or he would have her soul." He explained." do you agree to this contract?"  "Yes." She wrote back.  "Let the contract begin. Write your spell then send it to me and we will see who has your soul." He told her with an evil smiley face grinning.  Mystic Shadow wrote her vanquishing spell to the warlock.  I Mystic shadow High Priestess of the white light order yours and every evil being connected to this game sight end in defeat in computer language that means I just hit delete! She wrote sending a smiling angel face then she hit send and then the delete button. Her screen went bright red.  "Looks like you lost." She said as the guardian of the white light saw a vision of the teenager's souls returning to their bodies.  "One down and forty nine to go." Winema said smiling.   They went to the second site and this time she chose the demon of lust. She went on the game it was called Battle the Dark side too or lose your soul. Mystic Shadow thought to her self they are not to original.  "The object of the game was to cast a spell that could vanquish him or he would have her soul." He explained." do you agree to this contract?"  "Yes." She wrote back.  "Let the contract begin. Write your spell, then send it back to me and we will see who has your soul." He told her with an evil smiley face grinning.  Again, she wrote the same vanquishing spell as with the first evil internet game.  I Mystic shadow High Priestess of the white light order yours and every evil being connected to this game sight end in defeat so in computer language that means I just hit delete! She wrote sending a smiley face of an angel then she hit send and then the delete button. Her screen went bright red again.  "I like this game!" she said smiling at Winema. "I better keep going before the rest catch on to us. With in an hour she had defeated the evil internet game and the evil ones connected to those sights along with thousands of stolen souls returned to their bodies. "Keep searching there is probably more of them." She told Winema.  By the end of the day they had defeated every evil internet game and returned the teenagers stolen souls. The evil ones of the dark side now knew they were at war and began using humans to blow up churches, turning honest people into serial rapist and murderers. The news casters were announcing the evil out break taking place over the earth without any kind of explanation just that it was evil. Murkcaster told her the warriors and witches were ready to be sent out to destroy evil. The warlocks returned with a victorious fight against Carnal lover and his evil warriors. They had just begun to destroy the evilness inhabiting the world.  The Guardian of the white light was given an army of her own of the good souls that crossed over were now her angelic warriors. They would go on to battle the evil souls entering the humans having them to actually do their evil deeds for them as it causes chaos in the humans life which makes the evil spirit rejoice for not only did they exceed in getting their evil work accomplished as it brought nothing but pain, burden and chaos in their lives.  Mystic Shadow sat in the council room with a large screen floating in the air watching the evil taking place amongst the mortals. Sometimes she was helpless if the victim never asked for the Higher Powers help.  Cassandra who had long black curly hair. Her appearance was gray with black circles around her eyes, a voluptuous body, she was an evil spirit, in life she was a prostitute. She sold her sole for money. Cassandra entered the body of a fifteen year old girl who was a cheerleader for her school, she made the girl crazy with jealousy that the other cheerleaders were trying to get the coach to pick them for his pet thinking he would give them favors. She became obsessed with this idea. she decided to be the last to leave showering knowing he would becoming into check to make sure everyone was gone before locking up . Hearing him she came walking out of the shower wet and naked her blond hair dripping water down her completely tanned body. He turned his head not to look at the girl who was very well developed having a body of a twenty year old.  "Does my body not look appealing to you?" she asked smiling standing in front of him rubbing his chest with her hands.  "Yes your body is very appealing, but you need to put your clothes on Clarissa." He said still not looking at her when he felt her hand rubbing the front of his pants causing him to get an erection. She pressed her body against his. "Stop before we get into trouble." He told her trying to back up, but she kept pressing his body kissing his neck. She managed to unzip his zipper; he could no longer stop himself from taking her in his arms, kissing her full luscious lips, running his hands over her strong tight body. He brought her to the ground where he pleasured himself in this dangerous game. the young girl was burning with young passion that was being stolen from her because of temptation, a married man with a daughter her age who was about to have his world destroyed by lust and temptation for he just planted his seed inside of her that would grow into a child. The girl went to her parents that night telling them he took advantage of her , they had the teacher arrested for rape causing him to lose his family and going to prison for five years. as the girl continued to seduce married men with whom she came in contact with causing destruction in their lives by letting their secret slip out to their wives. The guardian of the white light found out about this girl and recognized the work of Cassandra. Winema sent Samuel to destroy Cassandra.  Samuel showed up at the girl's college as a married professor when the girl spotted him and decided he was her next target. Clarissa stayed after class with the pretense she needed help with her work having him to lean over her exposing her cleavage. She spread her legs placing his hand on her crotch. He ordered Cassandra out of the girl's body by holding his hand on her head. The girl began to shake with tremors as Cassandra exited her body leaping on the white light warrior. They wrestled around on the ground as the girl sat petrified. Samuel managed to pour the potion on her causing her to vanquish. The girl fainted from the fear that filled her body. Samuel made sure she was all right disappeared with out leaving her any memory of what had happened to her. The dark side seeing that they lost Cassandra to the white light warrior sent out a spirit, a man who had raped and killed women in his life until he was executed for his crimes. Clark Reagan was still just as evil and entered the body of Tom Richards who was on his honeymoon. The first victim would be his new bride Sherry; they were consummating their marriage when Clark entered Tom's body their love making become rough with him slapping her, then beating her, he threw her on her stomach as he sodomized her. She pleaded for her husband to stop, but he forced her to perform oral sex on him. He threw her back on the bed and he strangled her to death with her white nylon wedding stockings.   He left her body on the bed for the maids to find. He began stalking women in stores when he saw Tracy Holmes a young mother with a two-month-old baby boy. He followed her home where he posed as a sales man. Tracy opened the door to be shoved backwards into her house causing her to trip and fall. He dragged her into the living room kicking and screaming. He began beating her savagely, forcing her to undress. He threw her on the floor raping her; he punched her in her face causing her to lose two teeth. He sodomized her before strangling her with her baby's receiving blanket. He left her body on the floor for her husband to find while her young son lay in his bassinet crying. Clark went to a local diner, his server was Trisha Arnold. He waited in the parking lot following her home. As luck would have it, she lived alone. He waited patiently for her to go inside before he made his move knocking on her door. Trisha opened the door he pushed her backwards into the apartment unaware that her boyfriend a huge man was spending the night. He grabbed Clark while she called the police. Clark could not get away from the man he was to strong. Once the police arrived they arrested him. Tom Richards failed the polygraph test, he was sentenced to death by a jury of twelve. At that moment, Clark had found a new body to jump into a police officer who was sitting in the courtroom. Clark made his departure from Tom Richards's body Winema poured the vanquishing potion on him. "Don't you know that you can run, but you can't hide?" She asked him smiling watching him vanquished.  Cheyenne was due to deliver any day Murkcaster doubled the security of the palace so no harm would come to her and the baby. Cheyenne spent her days on the internet searching for more evil game sights when she found a site on a web site for children called the dark warriors and it was actually the same as the ones for the teenagers.  " Oh these poor innocent children . " she said playing the game as before where they asked for a spell to vanquish the mean Prince who steals the children's hero action figures, if they could not save their action hero they lost the hero as well as their souls. Once again she defeated the evil internet games .She began searching for these evil spirits knowing they would use more then just games to collect souls. She began searching adult web sites such as the porn sites. Evil used sex rituals believing it brought them more powers and energy to use towards goods destruction. She came across the site called Mistress of the dark to satisfy Men and Women let me seduce you right down to your soul. Mystic Shadow went on the sight posing as a woman who cannot get enough sex. She typed in the survey they requested  A woman appeared on the screen" welcome Peggy to my cyber room of sexual pleasures. I see you like big busted women with long black hair. Do I meet you requirements to meet your sexual pleasures?"  Yes. She typed on to the screen.  Good, if I had you I would let you touch and fondle my breast, kissing and sucking on them. The woman wrote her as she caressed her breast on the screen I am touching your wetness between your thighs with my hand softly. Tell me what would you want me to do then?  Pleasure me with your tongue. She wrote  I can make you feel like I am there licking you if you have a thousand dollars she wrote putting her hand on her own crotch. Tell me Peggy would you give me your soul for this pleasure?  What I will give you is this...   I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light have brought you and all evil connected to your sight defeat. I am vanquishing you when I hit delete. She wrote then hit delete as her screen again went bright red. She continued hunting the internet for the evil that was luring and then tricking people to say yes so they would have it in writing.  Mystic Shadow monitored the evil seductress also known as the black widow.  Anna the evil seductress with long red hair, she wore a seductive black dress and emulated a grayish glow. Her green eyes had deep black circles around them. In life she would marry men to kill them to collect their insurance money from the deaths. She now roamed the earth inhabiting women's bodies causing them to kill their beloved husbands. Grace Michaels a house wife, age fifty years old with shoulder length blond hair, brown eyes, she wore loose fitting dresses not wanting to show her voluptuous body. She was preparing dinner for her husband of twenty-five years when Anna stepped into her body causing Grace to feel nothing but contempt towards her husband. After they ate dinner she lured him to their bedroom where she began to seduce him, as she never had before, sitting on top of him, whom she never had done in the whole twenty-five years of marriage, she would only lay on her back.   Her husband was in such passion as she gave him the sex he only had read about, he got more and more into the depth of this lovemaking. With his eyes closed, she took a razor knife that she had under her pillow and slit his throat. Waiting a few hours cleaning herself up she called the police crying that she found her husband murdered in their bed. When the police arrived, she was hysterical sitting on the floor rocking back and forth. She was cleared of his murder. At the funeral it was just her and his brother, he noticed she was wearing a tight low cut black dress, he had never seen her looking so looking sexier then at that moment. He took her in his arms to comfort her and Anna cast her spell making him unable to control his lust for her as they stood in front of his dead brother lying in his casket. He ran his hands down her back pulling her closer to him. He pulled her dress up revealing her laced thongs and the thigh laced black nylons. She dropped to her knees and unzipped his pants giving him oral sex while his wife watched them in disbelief that her husband could disrespect his brother and her.   When they looked up, she ran out of the funeral home filing for divorce the next day. Anna kept him in her bed until the day they married and they found him murdered in a park. His throat had been slit while he was having sex. They figured it must have been a prostitute. Again at the funeral of her dearly departed husband she noticed his business partner eyeing her where again she began crying uncontrollably asking him to take her home after the funeral. They were still parked by the graveside when she began her seduction on him. He could not resist the lust he felt, they were like animals. A month to the date of the funeral they were married. He died on their honeymoon night from a massive heart attack. She forgot his heart medication his. The police arrested Grace for all the murders of her husbands and Anna stepped out of her body to search for another victim while Grace was put to death for the murders.  Anna found a interracial couple the woman Laura was very beautiful and sexy with long black hair and blue eyes, her skin looked like peaches and cream. Her husband was a construction worker and very built, he was six foot four, light green eyes and of African descent. Anna would have fun with him until she got the insurance on him for one hundred thousand dollars. That night Anna performed sex on him unlike Laura, she performed oral on him something that Laura never did. For the three months, Anna would seduce their sixteen-year-old son that she had taken a life insurance policy on as well. One-week end Laura's son and husband were going hunting. She hid waiting for them to come out of the cabin then shot both of them killing them instantly. After their funerals, she went to their seventy year old father's house since there were not any other surviving relatives, but her.   She told him she wanted to stay with him because it hurt too much being alone. That night as he lay in his bed she came to his room dressed in a red see through night gown, he sat up in the bed, his body became alive with sexual desires something it hadn't felt in twenty years. She started with oral where he began to breath harder, he threw her on her back riding her body as if he was twenty years old again when he suddenly suffered a major heart attack and died. She called the paramedics, but they pronounced him dead. It was said the deaths of his son and grandson were too much for him to take. And Laura collected the whole inheritance. Anna touched the lawyers hand as he read the probate. He had her sit on his lap so she could see it better. She sat down on his lap but it was actually the White Light warrior Derek. He ordered Anna out of Laura's body, she began to tremor as Anna exited her body, and he vanquished her with a potion. Laura suffered a break down spending the rest of her life in a mental institution.  Mystic Shadow lay on her bed when she had her first hard contraction and her water broke at the same time. She summonsed Murkcaster; he carried her to the birthing room. It was a glass room to allow the birth of the tiny princess to be seen by all of their followers. The only ones allowed in the room with her were her family. The pain was almost unbearable for her. She was in labor for eight hours when the little princess was born to Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster weighing eight pounds and six ounces. She had a full head of black hair. Tears of happiness fell from her parent's eyes as they gazed upon their tiny daughter.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 15 by Erotica_Writings ©  Once Cheyenne was back into her room she began to pack up her stuff by using her magic, she had decided to walk away from it all to give up the life of fighting for good since she blamed them for her losing the people that meant the most in her life. She took one last final look around the house and vanished. She reappeared in Sandals in Jamaica the place that she and Hank spent their last happy memories together. She bought a house turning it into a shrine with all of the pictures of her with Hank, Roger and Saunders on the walls and tables, she made a shrine of her and Hanks wedding day with candles burning continuous around it. She felt she had finally found a place where no one would bother her. UN aware that Snare rage an evil warlock had also set up residence in Jamaica. As soon as he saw Cheyenne in the market place he knew she was a witch and very powerful, he intended to possess her powers by means of her death.  He walked up to Cheyenne to meet her." well hello lovely lady." He said looking at Cheyenne with her long brown hair hanging loosely, wearing a blue and white flowered bathing suit top with a long matching wrap skirt that she had tied around her hips.  "Hello there." She said smiling at the man, with piercing blue eyes, blond hair hanging to his shoulders; he was tall with a deep tan and very masculine built. Wearing a pair of black surfer trunk's with red flames shooting up from the knees half way up his thighs.  "Could I interest you in some lunch since it has been such a long time since I have laid eyes on a beautiful creature such as yourself?" He asked her looking over her toned body." You must work out on a regular bases looking at your magnificent body."  "I try to work out as much as possible." She told him looking over his body as well." You too must work out from the look of your body."  "thank you, well if not for lunch what about a drink?" he asked her thinking a few hours of seduction wouldn't be bad before he killed her taking her powers from her.  "That sounds great I could use a drink of whiskey." She told him thinking what harm could come of it?  Gore warrior appeared in her room to find she was gone.  " That bitch! She lied to me!" he said angrily under his breath so the others could not hear him." I will find you, then kill you!" he said vanishing into the night. He began his search UN aware Cheyenne had blocked anyone from finding her until she was ready to be found.  As they sat at the bar Snare rage looked at her by the way my name is Tom." He said sipping on his drink.  "My name is Cheyenne." She told him ordering another whiskey.  Hearing her name he knew he had the High Priestess next to him.  "Well Cheyenne would you like to go swimming? He asked as he saw she was getting drunk on the four whiskeys to his two.  "Sure let's go." She said finishing her drink which was half full.  Down on the beach she dropped her wrap on the sand as she ran into the water as he watched her firm body and muscles as she ran in her thong bikini.  "Oh yes I am going to enjoy this." He said grinning to himself as he ran to the water jumping in.  He grabbed Cheyenne in his arms dunking her under water, where they wrestled around until they were face to face with his arms around her waist and her arms around his neck he kissed her deeply.   "Why don't we go back to your place where we can continue this exotic fun we are having." He said holding her in his arms.  "No not today." She told him pulling away she went up on the sand to dry off.  "I am sorry if you think I was just trying to get you for sex." He told her trying to get her alone to kill her.  "I will go to your place but not mine." She told him.  "Great let's be on our way." He said smiling at her.  Once back at his place as Cheyenne sat on the couch in his cottage he had on the beach she had a vision of him trying to kill her revealing his true identity. As he was in the kitchen making them a drink putting poison in her drink Cheyenne transformed into her warrior outfit. When he walked back into the room he saw Cheyenne standing in the middle of the room.  "So Snare rage did you think a mere little evil warlock could take me out of the picture?" she asked him, her voice remained calm.  "So the powerful Mystic Shadow found me out?" he asked then he flung a lightening bolt at her.  " is that your best shot?" she asked him as she reflected the lightening bolt having it turn back at him as he leaped into the air dodging it.  He then threw daggers at her which she jumped into the air shooting a fire ball in his direction." Ok you have bored me now." She said blowing him up into small sparks of fire with her hands. "What a shame he looked like he would have been great in bed." She said grabbing the bottle of whiskey, she had brought with her. She vanished from the room.  UN aware that by using her powers it allowed the council to pin point where she was at. They in returned told Aggatha, but was told not to do anything that they knew where she was at and they were going to use their secret weapon to bring her back to them. Cheyenne appeared back at her house she threw her self on her king size bed that she had Black satin quilts, sheets, matching pillow cases with a ruffled skirt on the bottom of the bed, her curtains were white lace. "Why do these warlocks and demons seem to spot me out of crowds?" she asked herself aloud not noticing the three figures that had materialized in room.  "Because you're just so damn irresistible." The male voice sounded like Roger she heard say to her.  Cheyenne sat up in bed looking at the three men standing in her room." It can't be." She said getting out of bed with tears filling her eyes as she walked up to them touching each one of them." Oh my God your alive!" she said through tear filled eyes she ran into Roger's arms kissing him, then hugging and kissing Hank and Saunders." How? You look so young like you did when you were only forty five." She told them looking them over feeling life and happiness seeping back into her body.  " When we died as mortals the high council made us into warlocks, it was for giving our lives in the battle. In addition, you did not hesitate killing Alex. You proved to them you are worthy of your title. When you blamed them and turned to drinking they knew that something had to be done without telling you about us before we completed our training as warlocks." Hank explained to his wife.  " And if I ever catch you around that snake Gore warrior there will be trouble." He told her holding her chin in his hand.  "Promise I will never go near him, the man I love has returned to me." She said so happy to see them.  "We picked the ages forty five because we didn't want you women to be jealous." Roger told her teasingly.  She smacked his arm." God I missed you." She said hugging him tightly crying into his chest as he held her tightly.  "I told you a long time ago I was waiting." He said looking down into her eyes kissing her forehead.  "Hey what about me?" Saunders asked her seeing Hank was getting mad at the two lovers.  "And you too my buddy, who would listen to me for hours." She said hugging Saunders as he wiped her tears away with a tissue he made appear.  "We four have to go now." Hank told her looking serious.  "Where are we going?" she asked.  "You are going up to the council with us where you are going to be dried out from all the alcohol." Hank told her as he grabbed her arms and the other two men each grabbed a leg and vanished.  When they arrived at the council Cheyenne looked around everything was white with a white glittering fog that floated, everyone there wore long white gowns. They took Cheyenne to a room where they strapped her down to a bed in a bed that was all white with glittering white fog." Why do I have to be strapped down for? I am not going to go anywhere." She told everyone in the room." Hank make them let me go." She pleaded with him as tears came to her eyes." please don't allow them to do this to me!" she pleaded trying to fight her way out of the straps.  A man stood beside her bed looking at her." Your an alcoholic Mystic Shadow, we have to dry you out, witches are just as susceptible as humans to alcohol." He told her.  "Now you three still have training to complete, you can visit her later." He told them.  As the alcohol began to wear off she began to yearn for it trying to get loose even her powers were useless here to free herself from the restraints. "I need out have here! Please give me a drink." She pleaded with the witch watching over her.  Cheyenne began to get worse, the next day she screamed and cried from the pain she was experiencing. She had black circles around her eyes, she began to vomit, and it pained Hank, Roger, and Saunders to see her to go through this.  "She makes the exorcist look like a comedy." Roger said as they watched her go through withdrawals.  The third day she was screaming like a crazy person, she imagined demons being all around her." Get them somebody! Get them their going to kill me!" She screamed out because for her they were so real. By the end of the week the straps had been removed, she was taken to the high council where they placed a spell on her. She would never want to taste alcohol. The four of them were told they were being relocated and since Cheyenne had already set up a place in Jamaica they had Aggatha to go and purchase a mansion there where they would live so the men could start new lives without being recognized.  Aggatha and the other women got things ready for their return they were UN aware of Gore warrior following them there where he even began dating Alicia. It was easy they no one knew what he looked like in his new form. Everyone was excited when the day came that the four had returned home. Alicia UN aware that they had returned that day brought Gore warrior to the mansion.  Cheyenne looked at him as she knew who he was before Gore warrior could make a move Roger who had been able to see him when Cheyenne blew the walls down smiled at him." You'll never touch her ever again." He told him as he vanquished him for good.  "Why did you do that for?" Alicia asked him angered by what he had just done.  "He vanquished Gore warrior." Cheyenne told her smiling at Roger.  Aggatha and the seven other witches looked shocked for they never had a clue of his identity.   Hank looked at Cheyenne picking her up in his arms." If you will show us our room Aggatha I have personal, very personal business to discuss with Cheyenne." He said smiling.  "Come to think of it Lindsey and I have some serious talking to do too." Saunders said picking up his wife.  Roger looked at the five remaining witches." Would you all like to talk in my bed?" he asked smiling as they all grabbed him dragging him up the stairs." Hey it's been along time, you might have to teach me all over again." He told them as they threw him in the shower turning on the cold water." That's the story of my life." He said as the cold water sprayed on him.   To his surprise Tammy stepped back in naked after the others had left." I have wanted to do this for along time." She told him as she began to remove his clothes.  "Tammy I am flattered, but I am not interested in you except for a friend." Roger told her trying not to hurt her.  "Sorry, I should have thought first." She said feeling humiliated. She quickly left the shower feeling animosity towards Mystic Shadow.  Life was good in Jamaica for them as the women set up a boutique for tourist to buy bathing suits and accessories. The shop's popularity took off quickly, the men opened up a charter boat business taking people out on the boats for fishing. No one was wise to that fact that they were witches and warlocks fighting against evil. Things had been quiet with the council not sending them to do any kind of vanquishing of evil warlocks, witches or demons.  As Cheyenne was helping a customer she had a vision of the woman being killed in her room at the resort by an evil warlock with short red hair, stocky built, green eyes and wearing a black dress suit. Cheyenne trying not to cause any curiosity to herself asked the woman." So are you enjoying your stay here?" she asked. " you know I have this special tanning lotion that I use, our shipment will be in later today if you give me your room number I will have some delivered for you to try." She told her hoping it would work.  "Oh that would be great." The woman told her who was very striking for a woman of fifty; her body was that of a twenty-year-old, blonde-hair and there was not one wrinkle.  "Ok I will ship it over later." She told the woman handing back her change.  Cheyenne had Gloria to watch the shop while she followed the woman back to her resort where she sat in the lobby waiting for something to happen. Two hours had gone by when Cheyenne saw the vision of the evil warlock in the woman's room and then she vanished without anyone noticing she disappeared. Cheyenne changed immediately as she stood in the woman's room as the warlock had her by her throat.  "Let her go." Cheyenne ordered him.  "Stay out of this witch if you know what is good for you!" he yelled at Cheyenne.  Using her powers she slammed him against the wall causing the woman to fall to the floor. Cheyenne looked at the warlock freezing him in motion." Tell me why this warlock is trying to kill you, lie to me and I will hand you over to him!" Cheyenne yelled at the woman.  "I told him if he kept me young I would give him my soul." She cried into her hands." He has now come to collect and I am not willing to give it to him now." She told Cheyenne.  "You foolish vain woman, you would give up your soul to remain young?" she asked angered by the woman.  Cheyenne unfroze the Warlock." you aren't getting her soul not today or any other day." She told him.  The warlock becoming outraged threw fire at Cheyenne which she caught in her hand then blew it out as she smiled at him." Come on give me your best shot." Cheyenne taunted him as he flung lightening bolts at her.  Cheyenne climbed up the wall and over the ceiling kicking him in his head." Don't piss me off! I told you your best!" She told him landing on her feet in front of him.  " you foolish witch you do not who you are dealing with I am Fury caster and I will Kill you then eat you." He told her through gritted teeth.  Cheyenne crossed her arms smiling at him." Well fury you must be oblivious to whom I am then. You see I am Mystic Shadow." She told him still smiling. "So you know what I am about to do to you right?" she asked still smiling.  "Oh shit. yes." He said looking at her as he swallowed hard bowing his head, as he knew he was up against the High Priestess Mystic Shadow.  With one quick movement of her hands he blew up.  Cheyenne looked at the woman." get up off the floor." She told her.  "Do I get to keep my soul?" she asked.  "Yes." Cheyenne told her." but first listen to this carefully." I the high priestess Mystic Shadow order to undo the warlocks spell sending it right back to hell." She said as she looked at the woman who began to age and wrinkle.  The woman looked in the mirror crying." no you made me old! I am now eighty years old instead of fifty!" She said crying as she looked in the mirror  "Be glad you still have your life and soul. Oh and one more thing before I go. Don't wear the thong bikini." She told her as she vanished from the room leaving the woman without any memory of her.  That night as everyone got home Aggatha met them with news that they had an assignment. " you all are going to go to Florida there are some demons who are killing the lady dancers, its believed a female witch is helping them to get to the women so you ladies are going to be dancers and you men are going to be bouncers." She told them.  "What kind of dance place need bouncers?" Roger asked her.  "Oh a place where the women dance naked and some do private dances." She told them.  "A strip club?" Roger asked with a smile.  "Watch it or you will lose a body organ." Tammy told him smiling with a wink.  "Ouch that would hurt." Hank said looking at Roger.  "When do we leave?" Cheyenne asked Aggatha looking strangely at Tammy and Roger wondering what was between them.  "Tonight they are having auditions and they need three bouncers seems the ones they had left." Aggatha said smiling.  "Well let's go bump and grind." Gloria told them.  "You make it seem so less glamorous when you put it that way." Alicia told her.  They all vanished and appeared at the club that looked like it was very high class. As the women stood outside the men went in to apply for the jobs as bouncers. The women looked at the women walking in the place they looked in their twenty's, and most of them were blond.  "How do we compete with that?" Margaret asked.  "Like this." Cheyenne said transforming her age to that of twenty years younger. She smiled at them." Personally I think I look better now at seventy though ." she told them laughing turning around in her outfit into a white leather dress that barely covered her, the sides were white lace revealing her flesh, thin straps that criss crossed in the front and back, she wore six inch white heels, with diamond earrings dangling from her ears. She wore her hair up in a French twist. "Get dressed I am going in now." She told them as she walked seductively pass the valet parking staff smiling as their heads turned.  "Man I can't wait to see that one with no clothes." The young thin blond haired man said watching her walk.  "Hell I will pay for a private dance." The big burly African American man told him." Ride papa baby." He said as Cheyenne looked back and winked at both of them." I am getting me some of that one." he said smiling as he thought of her being all over him.  Tammy and the other women were dressed similar to Cheyenne accept Tammy's dress was criss - crossed all the way down on each side, Gloria hadn't any back to hers just thin diamond straps that crossed, Margaret's was a long tight spandex dressed that was split up both sides, Alicia wore a short tight black lace dress with just black lace thongs under it so you could almost see her nipples., Cathy, Lindsey and Patty dressed as triplet school girls with their hair in pony tail, white shirts, plaid skirt with knee high's and black shoes that tied. As they walked by they bent over at the same time exposing their thongs to the two men.  "Oh my I have to get a shot at all of them." The big man said as his eyes were wide as he looked at the three girls.  Cheyenne was the first to be interviewed by the manger Tony who was a very large Italian man who looked sweaty all the time.  "Ok before I see you dance for me I need to ask you some questions. Now if a customer comes up to you and wants to do this to you?" he asked as he touched one of her breast. "what do you do?"  "I smile at them?" She asked him.  "No you tell them they can only do that in the private room and its three hundred which you get one hundred of." He told her.  "now just one more test in order to get this job you have to show me just how seductive you can be and that means removing your clothes and should I want an extra favor would you be willing to give it to me?" he asked looking at her body.  "Yes I would. I really need this job," she told him as he played the music.  Cheyenne stood up on his desk as she began to slowly move running her hands all over her body then removing her dress slowly to the music, where she only had on a white glitter thong. She squatted down in front of his face then rising up slowly as she removed the thong then bending over with her back to him spreading her legs  ." Come here" he said UN zipping his pants." now straddle me hurry." He told her as he was a sick demented man who made the women have sex with him in order to work to be killed by the evil ones who protected him from being busted by the authorities.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 15 by Erotica_Writings ©  She cringed at the thought. He began to fondle her she saw the demon and him making a deal. Cheyenne froze him then implanted the vision of them having sex." Sorry chubby, but your not touching this." She said making a horrible face at the thought of him touching her.  One of the deals the women had to pleasure the demons as did the men have to pleasure their witches. They needed fresh meat tonight. Cheyenne gave the performance of her life in the man's mind without actually doing the dirty deed. She thought to her self, I hope Roger has a gross ugly witch. Cheyenne was hired she started that night.  Hank, Roger and Saunders were being interview by three of the ugliest, fattest women. "Now you have to make sure the women do as they are supposing to and that is pleasuring our men in the private rooms, when we ask you men must come and pleasure us. And do not allow fighting between the customers to take place. Do you have a problem with having sex with us?" they asked the men.  The three of them shook their heads no as they were praying they didn't have to.  "Well then get over here," the women, told them as they laid on the beds they had in another back room. Hank, Roger and Saunders just met their worse nightmare having to pleasure these women. The men walked slowly to the beds removing their shirts when Cheyenne popped in to the room implanting the sexual illusion in the women's head then vanished winking at the men. She did the same favor for each one of her witches.  " you start tonight, but remember the girls are off limits to you three, you are just for us when ever we want it." She told them smiling.  As Cheyenne was up on stage dancing one of the demons came in she had seen with the huge grotesque man. He watched Cheyenne as she danced across the stage that was made of mirrors from the floor to the ceiling with small white lights lighting the stage and pole the girls used to dance with. He wanted a private dance from her. She agreed looking at the man with long black hair, thin built with a beard and mustache. Once in the room he began to kiss on Cheyenne, running his hands all over her, he became his natural form as he laid her down on the couch  ." I do not scare you?" he asked in a demonic voice.  "No you're just a smelly demon." She said as she watched him get angered by her words." get off of me now." She told him tossing him across the room and vanquished him as she was really feeling agitated with this whole thing. "If I have to do this all night I will get sick!" She said as she walked out of the room.  One of the dancers asked if she had seen Oranus the guy she was just with." I did him and he left he should be somewhere around here." She told the woman who touched Cheyenne's shoulder. Cheyenne knew she was a witch." Like what you see?" Cheyenne asked her smiling.  "Yes I do let's go into the private room for a private chat." She smiled at Cheyenne.   The two women went into the room when the woman caught Cheyenne off guard slamming her into a wall as she jumped on her." I am going to kill you bitch when I am done with you." She said licking her neck.  "You mean, mean old witch." Cheyenne told the other witch in a taunting tone.  The woman was shocked; she knew she was a witch. "How?" she asked shocked that she knew what she was.  " Mystic Shadow here, I cannot say there was any pleasure in meeting you though so...Bye - bye." Cheyenne said smiling as she waved bye she made the witch fly into the wall and blew her up.  Cheyenne was able to get to Tammy." So fat boy liked the vision of you performing oral huh?" she asked smiling.  "Yes thanks for that favor or I would have puked." She told her.  "Well I've vanquished a witch and a demon so far. There isn't any more in here now." Cheyenne told her looking around.  "I wish they would all show up at once it would be so much easier to vanquish them at one time." Tammy said.   "I know the owners make sure the girls will have sex that was the agreement with the demons and witches and that is when they kill them." She told Tammy.  "I don't know, but the witches kill the women so the demons must kill the men. They are being fed and having sex, these idiots are getting rich and you know its for their souls? They sold their souls for money, sex and protection from the authorities." She told Tammy." I am sending their souls to hell with the evil creatures. Be careful." She said as she watched the other women dancing on stage.  "Have you seen Roger Cheyenne?" She asked looking around for him.  "No and what is going on with you two?" Cheyenne asked Tammy.  "Guess he got tired of waiting for his elusive dream and went with reality. He's great in bed too." She lied smiling to her.  Cheyenne looked at her so hurt. "I didn't know, sorry." She told her and hurried to the women's room where she cried until she could carry on pretending to be a dancer.  Hank watched Cheyenne as men were making obscene remarks to her that she just laughed off. When one of the dancers came up to him.  " can I see you in the private room?" she asked.  "We aren't allowed to mingle with the dancers." He told her as he looked at the stunning red haired woman who stood in front of him naked.  "You're allowed with me or I will fire the fat bitches." She said smiling as she pulled him behind her into the room. "sit down" she said shoving him down on the couch then straddling him as she placed his hands on her large breast." I want you," she said kissing him passionately and unzipping his pants when Cheyenne appeared in the room.  Hank was not fighting the woman on top of him either.  "Get off of him!" she yelled as her face showed all the anger and disgust for this hellhole in her face.  "the woman's eyes glowed red." you'll regret this!" she said as she threw a dagger at Cheyenne.  Cheyenne laughed at her as she made it ricochet back at her hitting her in the arm.  "Who are you?" she asked getting off Hank's lap as she pulled the knife out of her arm.  "Mystic Shadow and your have just been fired!" She said as she set her a blaze then the evil witch vanished. She turned to Hank. "How far were you going to go with her?" she asked feeling angry but not with Hank really with Roger and Tammy.  "Please Cheyenne; I think I will be sick for a long time." He said kissing her.  "Let's go we have more vanquishing to do." She said as they vanished out of the room.  They appeared in separate places so no one would see them together. Cheyenne was laughing as Alicia was having to do a friction dance for a really nerdy guy with big ears, acne and he was pencil thin. Cheyenne could not believe the little jerk got off. Cheyenne saw Lindsey, Cathy and Patty go into the room with a man who looked like a school teacher. "Pervert." She said under her breath.  Cheyenne felt a man coming up behind her grabbing her breast." I am sorry sir we have to go to the private room and it's three hundred dollars" she told him.  'Well I will just take it for free then." he said pulling her into the bathroom shoving her up against the wall where he tried to sodomize her.  "Bull shit." she said as she had just about had her fill with this place. Using her powers she sent him into the wall then blew him up. "Even if you were a mortal you're just as evil trying to rape a woman." She said walking out of the men's bathroom where Saunders saw her.  "What were you doing in there?" he asked seeing it said the door had men on it.  "Sending a rapist to meet his maker." She said smiling." I am about ready just to blow this place up it discusses me so much." She told him looking around at all the men, some were married, or had girlfriends and they were in here having sex with these women.  Cheyenne watched as Lindsey, Cathy, and Patty came out of the room with the perverted old man who liked school girls." why couldn't you just be a demon so I could send you where you belong?" She asked when she had a vision of him killing a small nine year old girl after raping her." the hell you will mother fucker!" she said going up to the man pushing him back into the private room as the three women followed behind." Bastard you will never hurt a small child or any other living creature ever again!" she told as she blew him up. The other three women looked at her like she had just lost it. "He was going to kill a nine year old girl when he left here; I had to chose between him or a nine year old girl. One had to die and since he was going to rape and kill when he left here he lost." She said walking out when she had visions coming at her all at once she felt like she had a mini theater showing all the shows at one time." They're all here; quick get the men we have to do this now!" Cheyenne told the women as they gathered everyone to vanquish this place of evil.  They all stood in a circle with Cheyenne in the middle changing in to their warrior uniforms of the white light. Cheyenne rose up in the air spinning slowly with her arms stretched out straight on each side of her, her hair blew softly as she turned, everyone in the place watched her thinking it was part of their act.  " I Mystic shadow High Priestess order vanquishing of all the demons, evil witches and their evil counter parts sending them straight to hell where for eternity their souls shall dwell never to be released or any reversing of this spell for I have sentenced them to eternity to burn in hell." She ordered their demise then began spinning faster in a circle as the Demons, evil witches and their evil counter parts all blew up in red fiery infernos. The people continued looking up at Cheyenne where she looked at all of them." if I were you, I would run to your loved ones while your souls are still safe." She told them as she came down landing on her feet.  People began to run out of the place realizing this was not part of the show after all. The eight witches and three warlocks walked out of the place standing in front of the building, each pointing their hands in its directions they blew it up.  As the two valet men watched the big burly black man grabbed the small white man by his arm." Come on fool! We're going to church right now!" he said as they went running down the parking lot.  Cheyenne, Hank and the others all laughed as they watched the men running away. "Let's go home." Hank told them he wanted to wash the smut from his body.  "I hope Aggatha has dinner ready." Saunders said as they vanished into the night.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 14 by Erotica_Writings ©  1997  The following years the witches watched the men age gracefully in their golden years. The love they shared as a family helped them get through the tough times of the aging process. Alexander had turned twenty years old and still had not shown any type of witchcraft. He was going to college studying law, Roger and Saunders had retired from the police force when they reached Sixty-five years of age, they were now all in their seventy's. Cheyenne and the others still looked the same as they did twenty years ago. Aggatha now three hundred years old was meeting with the council to prepare for the battle of evil verses good, which was to take place in the very near future.  The eight witches were training harder to become better warriors when the time came. Their bodies were firm and built, they practiced blowing up objects sent flying at them unrepentantly, severing heads off mannequins with using the powers with their hands. Reflecting lightening bolts that were cast at them, flying high over the barn as Ralph who was very old and Ninja who had not aged watched the witches flying back and forth.  That night as they prepared potions, and vanquishing spells Alex called, he had just bought a house and wanted everyone to see it. They left the house before Aggatha could get back to tell them the news the council had learned of the dark side.  When they all pulled up to Alex's new home it was huge almost gothic looking. He showed them around the house. Cheyenne looked at her son, he was tall and had his father's coloring of milk chocolate, brown eyes. He is built muscular like Gore warrior, she thought to her self. She was very proud of her son and how well he had turned out.  "I've saved the best for last." He said smiling at his mother.  " my play room." He told them excitedly as he led them downstairs.  Once they were in the room Cheyenne became alarmed it was dark with candles lighting the room. Before she could say anything Alex with one swipe of his hand killed Hank, Roger and Saunders as the other demons came out of the shadows. Cheyenne and the other witches without a word changed into their warriors uniforms as they ran up the walls using their magical powers began blowing up demons. Cheyenne searched out Alex until she found him." You little bastard!" she said through gritted teeth grabbing him by the throat his face filled with terror, he had not expected his mother to be able to kill him. Cheyenne without hesitation had his heart in her hand before she blew him and his heart up. Not having the potions or weapons they had prepared for the battle, they had to depend on the ability and their magic to dispose of the evil around them. As the witches formed together holding hands they spotted Gina, Cheyenne ripped Gina's heart out of her chest with just one look, Gina's body began to smoke and sparkle before it blew up. Cheyenne's anger grew resulting in her powers growing stronger with the mixture of her fallen sister's that were gave to her. She began to float up in the middle of the room raising the seven other witches up with her. Mystic Shadow blew everyone up in the room until she and the other seven witches were the only ones left standing. Aggatha appeared in the room." Oh, thank God, you are all ok. I tried to get back to the house, but you were already gone. I tracked you here with the councils help.  "We all didn't make it." Cheyenne told her going to the two men's bodies whom she loved and even in death, she was torn. She cried kneeling in between them kissing them both good – bye, she began rocking back and forth as Lindsey held Saunders. The other witches stood behind them crying over the loss their family just suffered.  "Why? Why did they have to be sacrificed?" Cheyenne asked as she cried to the heavens above. "Why couldn't I sense Alex's evil with in him?" she asked crying laying her head down on Rogers's chest. He was her one true love. Guilt consuming her knowing she was the one who destroyed her son Alex. She held onto Roger's body until Aggatha pulled her from him forcing her to let go.  They carried their men who lost their lives to the Manor where they buried them in the family's graveyard. Cheyenne wore black from that day on never smiling. Her eyes held the longing to undo everything back to when she was with Roger. She stared out her bedroom window for hours drinking whiskey.  A month had gone by and Cheyenne spent most of the time drinking whiskey to stay drunk to run away from the pain of losing Hank, Roger, and Saunders. The other women worried that if she did not snap out of it that she too would be loss to them. They watched helplessly as she slowly killed her self-escaping the pain with in the walls of her heart.  Two months had gone by since that deadly day, Cheyenne stayed in her room drinking herself to oblivion. The women were talking when they realized that Gore warrior had not shown him self. Why? They had not heard anything of him and that was the day he had longed for. He had not tried to revenge Alex's death. Where had he gone? Cheyenne she decided she was going out, using her magic she dressed as sleazy as she could, looking like a high-class call girl then vanished appearing in the alley of a bar. She walked to the front of the bar and men were whistling at her as she walked by. She entered the dimly lit bar with the smoke so thick you cut it with a knife. She sat at the bar ordering a whiskey straight up on the rocks. She sipped her drink slowly unaware of the man who sat next to her dressed in a black T-shirt that fit tightly to his muscles, loose fitting black jeans with black boots, a thick gold chain around his neck. The bar tender watched him thinking he did not stand a chance picking her up.  " long time Cheyenne." He said running his finger down her shoulder to her hand feeling the desire he was igniting in her body.  Cheyenne looked at him even though he had changed into another body it was similar to his old one." Don't you get tired of the same look?" she asked as he continued to run his finger up and down her arm softly.  "No, just like I never get tired of yours." He told her as he moved his hand to her thigh. "You're not going to blow me up Cheyenne?" he asked her kissing her ear.  "No, I killed our bastard son." She said smiling then sipping her drink as his hand went further up her thigh. "Call me Mystic Shadow Cheyenne died with Roger." She told him bitterly sipping her whiskey.  "I know you killed him, he and the others all turned their backs on me. So now I am just winging it on my own." He said as he leaned over licking her shoulder." I have no connection to them except to destroy the highest ones of them," he told her moving closer to her kissing her passionately.  Mystic Shadow pulled away from him, "if I am one on your list do it now I really don't care anymore." she told him looking him in his eyes when he began kissing her causing a fire to come alive with her body when they appeared the motel room he was staying in.  "Why are we here Gore warrior?" she asked with her breathing becoming heavier as he held her body in his arms kissing her neck down to her cleavage.  "Because we are on the same side now it's called alone. The good council let you down by not protecting the humans." He told her as he raised her dress up over head exposing her still tight muscular body; he slowly removed her white lace thongs." I am going to make you forget your pain Mystic Shadow." He told her as he laid her on the bed removing his clothes. She moaned in pleasure from his tongue sliding slowly down her stomach. He could not control him self any longer he took her roughly as their passion burst into a powerful heated explosion.  After their hours of love making Cheyenne past out from the alcohol. Gore warrior took them to a dark dungeon where he planned to keep her there with him. He caught her at a vulnerable time and planned to use it to his advantage. " You are now my sex slave." He said laying the sleeping Cheyenne on a bed; he had already had this place set up for this day.  As he watched her sleep he made sure she had no clothes to put on when she a woken, he would have her perform sex acts on him. He had become even more demented over sex since the night she fought off his powers and more obsessed with having her forever.  The other women began searching for Cheyenne when they realized she had left the house. They were just seconds in finding her, but Gore warrior had vanished with her from the bar. They looked every where; they went so far to even nail posters with her pictures on it to anything standing. A big burly man named Jake told them that she was at the bar the other night with a black Mr. clean." That dude was all over her, and she was not fighting his advances either. She was into him just as much as he was into her. Then they just vanished." He told the seven witches.  They looked at each other knowing he had finally gotten her in her weakened state of mind. "We have to find her." They said going back to the house to tell Aggatha.  Aggatha was in the kitchen making up new potions when the women came in to the kitchen by the looks on their faces she knew it could not be good news." What has happened to her?" she asked going to the kitchen table to sit down.  "We know who has her, but we don't know where he has her." Tammy said.  "Gore warrior, he gave up the dark side, but he did not give up on Cheyenne." Aggatha said putting her head into her hands." what is the bastard going to do to her?" she asked as tears came to her eyes.  "Can the council locate where they are at?" Cathy asked.  "I will go ask them for their help." She told them as she vanished into a white cloud.  The seven witches looked at each other scared for their friend, leader, and sister in witch hood. "Protect her please." Lindsey asked looking towards heavens direction  That morning Cheyenne woke up next Gore warrior." Oh God it wasn't a dream after all." She said looking around the shrine he had made with her pictures lit by candles." What the hell kind of place is this?" she asked holding her throbbing head." God I need a drink." she said looking around.  "Mystic Shadow you're a wake now." He said as he rubbed her back with his hand.  "I need a drink, where's the whiskey?" she asked looking back at his naked body.  "Here is a drink of whiskey." He said pouring her a glass.  She drank it down." Oh much, much better to deal with the world." She said turning towards him." I remember last night the way you made my body feel so good." She said as she straddled across him kissing him." I have no reason to be in their world anymore, they took the most important part away from me and I don't ever want to go back." She said licking his lips as he felt her breast.  "I made this so you couldn't leave me ever again. You belong to me forever." He told her as he threw her back on the bed kissing her passionately "Tell me who do you belong to now?" he demanded of her.  "You, I belong to you." She said giving in to him for with out the love of Roger, there was not any reason to resist him anymore or his temptations. She no longer cared about the things she once did. She gave her body to him willingly.  That day they drank all the whiskey they had from the night before.  Cheyenne looked at him and into the empty bottle." we need more." She said looking into the bottle feeling not one bit of pain.  "there's a problem, I didn't think you would agree to join me so I made it so we can't get out of here and no spell can get us out or detect where we are at. " Why don't you come here and drink me." He said pulling her back on the bed...  " I can get out of here, I am the priestess of... of... oh well of something." she said drunk from the alcohol." Watch I will go and get us more whiskey so we can finish me drinking you." She said as she stood in the middle of the room. Mystic Shadow vanished into thin air causing Gore warrior to leap from the bed. She came falling back to the ground. "What the fuck!" She said sitting on the floor naked rubbing her head.  Gore warrior was laughing at the sight of her." Here's a thought, we have a drunken witch, and a drunken demon and neither one of us can get out." He said laughing so hard from the thought of her trying to get out.  "You cast the spell, just reverse it.," she said getting up off the floor aggravated she staggered over to him.  "I forgot what the spell was." He told her looking serious at her." It was so long ago and I thought you would fight Me." he tried explaining to her.  She looked at him in disbelief, "you thought we were just going to live in here and fuck like rabbits?" she could not believe he had trapped them in there.  "Cheyenne, I mean Mystic Shadow who ever you are I did not think you would give in to me so easy." He told her sitting up in bed looking at her.  She looked at him feeling anger towards him." Nothing can get out.... why can't you make a bottle of whiskey appear since you're the creator?" She asked running her hand through her hair as she sat on the side of the bed.  "I will try, only because I am thirsty too." He said slightly laughing when a bottle appeared in his hand." Hey it worked!" he said as they both began to laugh as they fought over the bottle to be the first one to drink from it.  "Come here demon boy, and let me have my witchy way with you!" she told him jumping on top of him stealing the bottle." Keep me drunk and I will be happy," she told him smiling down at him feeling victorious.  Aggatha came back to the house with news from the council, the other women waited patiently to hear what she had found out.  " They say that now they cannot find out where she is at... They are working on it, but they did detect that she has with drawn and lost her will to go on since the deaths. "She stopped taking a deep breath as she wiped the tears away." They can feel her sorrow while she mourns for her soul mate and friends. The problem we have encountered is she blames the council and her self for not protecting them." She told the women sadly sitting down on the stare case. The seven witches gathered around her.  "So what are they going to do?" Tammy asked in an irritated voice, they already knew this.  "They are working on it." Aggatha told them looking worried.  "This is just great! Cheyenne is missing, kidnapped and they are working on it?" Gloria asked as she sat back in her chair frustrated.  A few days had passed and still no word of Cheyenne, the women tried working spells to see if they could find her that way. The women were becoming more determined then ever to find Cheyenne and bring her back home.  Cheyenne and Gore warrior had spent three days of drinking and having sex Cheyenne had become bored of the dungeon." I can't stay cooped up in here any longer." She told him getting out of bed and pacing the floor.  "I can't remember the spell or I would reverse it." He told her realizing it wasn't a great plan after all.  "When you made this place didn't you think of showers?" she asked feeling very itchy from lack of water.  "I just wanted to get you here." He said looking around the prison he created for the two of them.  "So why did you wait?" she asked.  "I realized that with Roger around I would never really have you, so I waited, the more I waited the more I worked on this place," he told her.  "Look I got to get out of here! Do you understand me?" she asked him getting irritated with the place and her pain from him mentioning Rogers name.  "If we get out of here I will lose you." He told her that was his worse fear.  She stood over the bed smiling smugly." If we do not get out of here... I will kill you from going mad in here!" She told him getting more frustrated with him. "Demons are not the brightness I see." She said becoming more agitated," Look concentrate on the damned spell." She said rubbing her hands together. " I haven't any reason to leave you. There is no one out there waiting for me anymore. I just want to get out of here." She said kissing his lips softly then licking them as she began to kiss him more passionately using sex and alcohol to lose her pain she was feeling for Roger. After their game of sex he tried to remember the spell but came up empty. Cheyenne could stand being trapped in the dungeon of love any longer stood in the middle of the room summoning every power she had making the walls crumble. They looked at each other as the walls crumbled around their feet. They laughed seeing the sun light. Cheyenne taking another drink of the whiskey looked at him." The sun light feels good." She said laughing like a child. Gore warrior sat on the bed looking at her.   She was spinning in the sun light around and around. "I see a pond let's go swimming," she said running into the water he chased her. They played in the water until memories started seeping back into Cheyenne's mind she swam to Gore warrior wrapping her legs and arms around him she kissed him." Make me forget." She said as he began to caress her breast and they had sex in the water. Cheyenne looked at him after their sexual encounter in the water." I have to go home, meet me in my room tonight." She told him kissing him then vanishing. Cheyenne did not have any intentions of sticking around waiting for Gore warrior to show up. She had decided on plans that did not include him with her.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 13 by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne and Hank knew they had to face their problems that she could no longer run from him or the issues they had. Hank booked a two week cruise for them in Jamaica to rekindle their romance in their marriage. The two weeks were heaven, the first day Cheyenne had her hair braided by the women as she sat on the beach in a thong bathing suit, she experienced snorkeling under the water exploring the beautiful reef's, she could reach out and touch some of the exotic fish swimming amongst them. They rode horses with a tour guide. At night, they had romantic dinners with dancing and walked on the beach running and playing like kids a long the sandy beaches. The last night of their vacation Cheyenne and Hank sat in their room where they had a serious discussion of her life as a witch.  "Hank I just want you to understand about why we do what we have to do when we are in some of the rituals we have to pretend we are of the dark side. The sexual rituals gain energy and power, everyone must participate, and if we did not we would be discovered and killed. Sometimes we use sex as means to seduce an evil warlock or demon to bed where we find the most vulnerable qualities to destroy, vanquish what ever you want to call it." She told him while holding his hand as she spoke." When I do these things, I separate the Cheyenne you know and become Mystic Shadow who is very ruthless and heartless. I have to forget I am a wife and mother so I may do my work that was handed down to me by my mother. So when I am in the white light warrior's uniform I am Mystic Shadow, a powerful warrior not your wife." She told him knowing the whole time she longed for Roger, but she had to give it one more chance with Hank.  "How can you tell an evil warlock or demon if he looks like us?" he asked her becoming very interested in this subject.  "Well they have to use magic to hide some of the hideous formations they end up growing such as bat wings from their back to able them to fly, or hoofs so they use magical means to hide them so they are able to be among the humans." She explained." However, they usually give them selves away to someone like me. Casting a spell, or a scent that we would recognize, but sometimes they get past us too." She told him wishing she could just tell him that she wanted to be with Roger.  "So why do warlocks not like witches?" he asked  "Evil dislikes good witches or warlocks that some refer to us as white witches or warlocks, it's like a serial killer has a certain pattern to which he kills. Here again it takes us back to evil being the source to push him into doing these crimes that gives evil more power. So evil tries to destroy all that is good and that is why they don't like the White Light warriors. "She told him as they sat on the couch in their suite.  Cheyenne looked around the room as it was so beautiful Jamaica had a special magic of its very own, still Cheyenne's own ghost could not be kept away from it's magic and beauty.  After their talk, they went down to join the festivities; they ate, drank, and danced the night away.  Cheyenne and Hank were getting ready the next morning to leave to go back home. When they were boarding the boat Hank leaned over and whispered into Cheyenne's ear." People must think I am very rich or very well endowed to have such a young hot babe on my arm." He said laughing, as he was a very striking man at the age of sixty-two, his body was still toned and built when he was forty five.  "If asked I will tell them both," she said squeezing his ass in front of an elderly couple who gave a quiet chuckle at Cheyenne's flirtatious actions.  When the ship finally docked they were met my Tammy." I have missed you two so much!" she said hugging them. " Great tans! I love the braided hair and I do want to borrow that dress." She said looking at the long white dress that showed off Cheyenne's curve's, with a slit on the left side up to her hip. Only one long sleeve, the other side was sleeveless and white sandals." By the way, still no sign of Gina. Fredrick said that Gore warrior seemed to vanish also, he destroys the ones holding him and now is among the wanted and missing. I just love you in that deep purple shirt with those white slacks and white shoes Hank." She said displaying a huge smile.  "That comforts me knowing those two are on the loose." Cheyenne told her.  " He hasn't pulled you into a dream?" Tammy asked her.  "No not since Texas where I was able to free myself of any feelings for him." She told her.  " Guess he finally got the message that you don't want him." She told Cheyenne.  Cheyenne smiled with a twinkle in her eye as her long brown hair flowed in the wind. "By the way those brown shorts with the dark green shirt and white sneakers are totally divine and what else do you have to tell me?" Cheyenne asked her tilting her head to the side with a huge smile knowing Tammy had bad news.  "Okay, there is a warlock that is hunting witches. He kills them to steal their powers." She told them  "let me guess, we are going to start hunting him, vanquish him so that their powers are freed along with their spirits Right?" she asked smiling at her since they had just stepped foot on land and already they had an assignment.  Once back at the house they went to the room where all their spells, potions, and weapons were kept. As Cheyenne was being informed of the situation she was leafing through the books they had.  "Does anyone know what this Warlock look's like or a name?" Cheyenne asked the women.  "Just that he has long black hair, blue eyes, built really great and he wears black." Gloria told him  "Well you just described half of the male population." She said looking at some interesting spells." How does he destroy the witches and get their powers?"  "He literally kisses their life and powers out of them and into him self." Margaret told her.  "Now that is what I call a great kisser." Cheyenne told them sarcastically." I think we should go to the Manor where we can have him come to us just attack him. Just don't let him kiss any of us." She said making a horrible look on her face and shuttering at the thought of their lives been kissed away.  The eight women changed into their outfits, they told everyone  good - bye that they would be back. Once at the manor the witches made a pentagram in the room where she gave birth to Alex.  The witches held a piece of clothing that they were able to obtain through the council from the last slain witch. Cheyenne held the cloth in her hands as she said. "Show me my fallen sister, your slayer, guiding us so may we revenge the lives stolen from our fallen sisters. I beg the Higher Power to grant our request." She said as a vision began to appear to her of the warlock in an alley with another witch he was about to kill." Quick, hold hands." She told them so she could take them with her.  "Why are we here? " Alicia asked looking around the alley.  "He is going to be here with another witch to kill. Let's hide so we can attack here since our plans have been changed." She told them seeking a place where they could see them enter the alley.  The warlock and the witch appeared in the alley, she struggled against him to be free from his tight grip on her.  "Why do you try to escape from me witch? You know I am going to get what I want." he told her grabbing her by the waist to take her and powers.  "Oops change of plans here." Cheyenne said as the eight witches circled him holding the other witch in his arms as she struggled.  He threw a ball of fire at Tammy that she reflected off her by using her hand sending into a wall.  "Didn't your mama tell you it's dangerous to play with fire?" Tammy asked him then sent a lightening ball at him hitting him in his leg.  "Bitch! " He said throwing a dagger at Cheyenne that she caught in between her teeth. He still did not loosen his hold on the other witch.  "I was always good with my mouth." She said smiling as she threw the knife back it landed in his thigh causing him to let the witch go. The eight witches stood around him in a circle as the other witch stood behind them. "You've really pist me off!" Cheyenne said smiling with a devious look in her eyes as she raised him up in the air then dropping him to the ground." Awe did that hurt the big bad warlock?" she asked taunting him as the other witches began their chant.  "Hear our plight and release the souls and powers of our fallen sisters, send this Warlock to the lake of hell on a one way flight ." they kept chanting this as Cheyenne grabbed him by the back of his hair pulling his face up to hers.  " Consider this the kiss of death." She told him through gritted teeth placing her lips on his freeing the witches souls and powers into her." Now I am going to vanquish you." She told him as the others had cast a spell where he could not move and Cheyenne poured a potion on him.  The warlock began to spin as a twister in the alley then in a golden sparkle blew up into flames. They watched as the Warlock's demon soul screamed out from the flames delivering it to hell.  As the other witches watched Cheyenne stand with her arms out stretched, her head tilted back looking up at the heavens." Fly free my sisters." She said a white fog flew out of Cheyenne's mouth.  As their souls hovered above her they sprinkled a glittering dust over her." We gave you our powers Mystic Shadow to use in the battles to come." One witch told her as they flew up ward into heaven.  The witch they saved looked at Cheyenne and the women." Thank you for coming to my rescue. I could not get away from him no matter how hard I tried. Be sure to know I will be there to fight by all of your sides in the great battle." She told them then vanished.  "Let's go home ladies." Cheyenne told them smiling and vanished.  That night at the house they all sat around the living room talking about Cheyenne and Hanks trip, they were laughing and showing the videos of the coral reef's, the horse back riding, the festivities at night. Roger and Cheyenne's eye's would meet, the longing they felt for one another was becoming unbearable for them. Roger under stood how she felt about commitments and knew she had to full fill it until she had tried all that she could in making it work. He refused to go on with another woman and stayed in the background waiting patiently.  Cheyenne wanted Roger to be happy and not alone as he was now. He would look away when Hank touched Cheyenne's leg or Hand as they sat next to one another.   Hank noticed the exchange of special looks between Roger and his wife; he kept it to him self-trying to control the jealousy of another man having Cheyenne's attention. He had started seeing a therapist to help control it.  The other witches knew it had to be hard on Cheyenne being with Hank who she did love, and living in the same house with the man, she was in love with. They were happy not to be in her situation though.  That night Cheyenne lay awake staring at the ceiling, tears ran down her face realizing that Roger would never be in her life, they were all in their sixties now, but she still looked forty-five years old as did the other witches. Why did fate hand us such a raw deal in our relationships? She thought to her self finally succumbing to sleep as the sun was coming up.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 12 by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne returned to the house to straighten out her life once and for all. “Where is everyone?” She whispered wiping her tears away with her hands.  The eight witches returned back to the house to found it to be empty. “They were all here when we left.” Cathy told her.  Aggatha reappeared at the house.” Hello I had to go get some roots and things.” She told them.  “Where is everyone else?” Cathy asked  “Roger and Saunders went to work seems another poor soul was murdered, and Hank took Alex to play ball at the park.” She said.  Cheyenne sat at the table where the women made a potion to ward off any spell Gore warrior had on her. Cheyenne drank it making a horrible face. “That is nasty.” She said almost gagging from it.  “Where’s Gina?” Cheyenne asked.  “She never came home from the week end.” She told Cheyenne.  Gina knew they would be coming for her so she left the state to go to Chicago and would return when she had enough powers to fight Cheyenne and the seven other witches.  Hank came home from the park with Alex; he looked at Cheyenne it shocked him when she walked away from him going up stairs. He followed her into their bed room.” What we can’t even talk?” he asked her.  “Why would you want to talk to a murderous whore for?” she asked calmly looking at their bed.  “I shouldn’t have said what I did.” He told her looking at her as she sat on the bed.  “I am a witch; I have been given a job to protect innocent people, even if they are of the supernatural world. Sometimes I may have to lure a demon or warlock to bed to destroy him and that is why I think we should get a divorce.” She told him not looking at him.  “I am only human and I say things that I know I shouldn’t and I still do it. Please Cheyenne don’t ask me for a divorce. I love you.” he pleaded with her.  Using her magic she changed into her warrior outfit.” I have to go catch a killer.” She told him and vanished.  She appeared next to Roger as he was leaning over one of Gina’s victims.” Find out anything?” she asked causing Roger and Saunders to jump from being startled by her just popping in on them.  “Jesus! you were trying to give us a heart attack?” Roger asked her holding his chest.  Cheyenne smiled trying not to laugh at them.” Sorry about scaring you two big tough guys.” She said teasingly punching him lightly in his arm.  She leaned down and touched the man’s hand. She saw him stabbed repeatedly by his tormentor who was in a sexual frenzy. Cheyenne looked into the eye's of the man and was shocked.” oh my God no! Not her.” She said looking in the man's eyes seeing his killer.  “What is it Cheyenne.”? Roger asked her.  Cheyenne dropped her head down.” Your killer is Gina, she blocked me or any other witch from seeing her, but his eyes became my vision because they weren’t blocked.” She said getting up as she looked at the two men.” She is gaining her powers from sex while she is killing her victims. We will have to find her and then vanquish her. she is completely evil.” She told the men as they were shocked by the news’s that their killer has been living right under their noses. “I have to go she has to be caught before more innocent men are killed by her lust.” She told them then vanished.  Once back at the house Cheyenne told the other member’s of the house about Gina that they had to find her. As the other women were preparing to go off to hunt down Gina, Cheyenne went up to see Alex before she left where she found Hank talking with him about the ball game.  “I have to go away for a little bit, if you see Gina stay away from, her she is sick and may try to hurt you. Stay far away and call Grandmother Aggatha she will contact me. Ok sweetie?” she asked him leaning over kissing him good-bye.  “Can we talk Cheyenne?” he asked her seeing she was still upset with him.  “You will have to make it fast I have lives to save,” she said in a cold voice and a look that turned his blood to ice.  “Can we please talk this over before jumping to a divorce? We have twenty years together let’s not act foolish.” He pleaded with her.  “When we come back we will talk it over Hank.” She told him then vanished.  She reappeared in front of Roger with the seven other witches. Cheyenne looked at him wrapping her arms around his neck kissing him with all the love and passion flowing through her heart and soul for him. ” in case, I don’t make it through the battle.” She told him leaving the room and leaving him and Saunders in shock.  Gore warrior was listening to their conversation. He could not stand it that she was talking with him. “I showed you the murderer in the dead man’s eyes and still you won’t accept who is doing this for you? He asked in disbelief vanishing from the room to see what Cheyenne and the other witches were up to. The women had already vanished before he got there. This made him angrier now he had no way to track them unless they cast a spell. He could track them by the spells they cast.  Cheyenne and the seven other witches tried using every means to find her. So far, they had tracked her to Texas where she had stayed. They decided to stay the night there and start again in the morning. ” Why is she so hard to find?” Gloria asked feeling as if they were looking for a needle in a haystack.   “She cast a spell on us so we cannot see her, thank God for the dead mans eyes showing her reflection.” She said as it was then than that it hit her.  “How could a dead mans eyes have any reflections?” she asked as she thought about it. Then it came to her Gore warrior was the only one who knew. He told me without directly telling me. She thought to herself. “Well I am going to bed.” She said turning off her lamp on her side of the bed.  That night as she slept Gore warrior called her into the dream world in the room with the lightening she watched him walk up to her praying the potion was going to break her spell he had placed on her. “What do you want?” she asked him as she noticed he was wearing different clothes now a tight fitting black tank top and black slacks.  ” You got a promotion I see by the new clothes you have on...” She said looking at him.  He smiled at her.” I guess you could say that.” He said looking at her standing in her long red nightgown.  “Red looks good on you.” He said trying to convince her he just wanted to be friends.  “Thank you, now what do you want?” she asked as she knew the potion did not work, UN aware he had cast a spell to counter act the potion.  “You’re all I want, to ravish your body because I know how my touch makes you feel, how your body moves with mine, how I pleasure you like no man can or ever will.” He told her pulling her body up against him tightly as he caressed her breast. He could feel her wanting to give in to him.  “No Gore warrior stop.” She said pushing away from him.  “ I am tired of you teasing me and I am taking what is rightfully mine here and tonight!” he said ripping her gown off of her as he threw her on the ground where he laid on top of her un doing his pants as she tried to fight him off of her. He raped her for what seemed to be like hours. As he held her arms pinned back over her head with his hands. Cheyenne saw Rogers face in her mind as she cried while being raped.  “Next time try me when we are not in a dream world where I am powerless.” She told him as he lay on top of her.  “Why didn’t you wake up?” he asked forcing her to face the fact that she wanted to stay here.  “Fuck you Gore warrior! I wanted to prove to myself that my body is over you!” she yelled at him. “You’re just a drug and I am a junkie! Your no longer the drug that I want to fill my veins with!” she told him in a tone that he knew she was now strong enough to fight him and she never give into him again.  Cheyenne woke up in her bed angry, with him. In addition, at herself for not using that time to find out from him where Gina was. Yet she knew in her heart what ever there was between them it had ended for her.  Gore warrior was just as angry because she left him for good. As he walked down a sidewalk he saw a private school where the students lived he went inside. He heard the shower running and looked in to see who it was in there.   She was a seven-teen year old virgin who was tall, blonde hair and blue eyed; she was saving herself for marriage. Gore warrior smiled coming up behind her pressing her up against the wall as he caressed her small breast. The girl was too petrified to move as she could feel him touching her. She did not see anyone; he dragged her to the ground where he began raping her. Every time he thought of Cheyenne, he would become even more vicious with the attack on the horrified girl until he exploded inside of her out of anger. If he had all of his powers restored he would have blown the whole school up. The girl laid on the floor crying and bleeding from the brutal attack she received from Gore warrior she watched the shower room door open and closed by it self she began screaming viciously. She never saw whom, or what it was that attacked her so savagely.  Cheyenne and the seven witches searched for Gina every inch of the world, but Texas was the last place they could actually place her, their spells for conjuring her up was even useless to them. They went back to the house empty-handed feeling defeated in their search for Gina. Cheyenne knew she was going to have to deal with her own personal problem at home. She loved Hank, but she was in love with Roger.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 11 by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne, Roger and Saunders walked in where the first victim was killed it was Gina's teacher's house. As she walked in the living room where it happened a vision came to her she could see the teacher and him coaching one of his students to remove her clothing, but she could not visualize on the student nor could she hear her name when he said it. She could see he was having sexual relations with someone but not the person, she saw the knife plunging into his heart killing him but not the one doing the killing.   "I don't understand why couldn't I see the person who did this?' she asked herself a loud." it as if I was blinded to the person capable of killing, but felt the power and gratification they received from it and nothing else."  "Well let's try another one." Roger said to her.   They went to the where Gore warrior first made his appearance and she felt that he had been there. She even saw when he grabbed the person's ankle but again not the killer. She walked into the bathroom where all she could see was a melting face in the mirror. "Gore warrior you were here but why?" she asked looking at the mirror when she started to see his image coming into the mirror.  "What connections do you have to this murder?" she asked him.  He smiled then faded away. "Damn it!" she said knowing he was here that night. When she walked back into the room with Roger and Saunders she saw the man's body lying on the floor as it had been the night of the murder, no one else in the room saw it but her. Realizing she was reliving that night. Gore warrior was here. She thought to her self, she felt him. As she walked past the man he grabbed her ankle, Cheyenne began to scream it felt so real. She knew Gore warrior had jumped into the murdered mans body but why? She heard him screaming at her." You bitch! So your glad I am dead!" she was trying to get away as she felt herself being dragged closer to him. Roger and Saunders stood looking at her, not knowing what was happening to her. Finally she broke loose of his grip and ran outside looking both ways not sure where to run for safety. Cheyenne finally snapped out of the spell that she had her re-live that night of the murder. Roger and Saunders ran to her.  "What just happened in there Cheyenne?" Roger asked her looking at her as if she saw a ghost.  " Gore warrior was there, he knows the murderer, he was angry with her for being glad he was dead, he projected himself into the dead man's body and grabbed her ankle as he yelled at her, she broke away running outside but was confused as to which way to go then I came out of the vision. I re-lived it as if I was her." She told them as she was a bit shaken by tonight.  Roger got a call on the police radio another victim was found a truck driver." Are you up to going?" he asked Cheyenne worried at how she was being effected by the murder scene.  "Yes, is the victim still there?" she asked thinking perhaps she could get a better vision of the perpetrator.   "Yes they have not touched anything." He told her.  They drove out to where the murder had just happened a few hour's ago. Cheyenne touched the truck, she saw him talking to a red haired woman, while he was on the stretcher in the body bag Cheyenne opened the bag and touched his hand. The woman was in a sexual frenzy slashing him repeatedly as she was having an orgasm. "She is very sick and demented, these are sex killings, its how she gets her thrills and she actually gets energy from it." Cheyenne described the woman to Saunders, they even pulled up a set of finger prints and red hair from inside the truck. Cheyenne never saw her in her demonic form just as the dead woman. Roger took Cheyenne home while they went back to run the prints. Cheyenne went into her room since everyone else was either out or in bed. She took a deep breath maybe I can call on Gore warrior in the dream world and he will answer my questions she thought to herself. "Gore warrior I call for you to come before me." She said aloud. She waited for a few more minutes but nothing. "Gore warrior please I need to talk to you." She said in an almost pleading voice. Still he did not come to her. Not realizing she had fallen a sleep. she began to dream again of the dark room and there was Gore warrior waiting for her." What do you want from me Mystic Shadow?" he asked as he stood with his arms folded he had on a white T shirt and blue jeans that fit him tight, the shirt out lining his muscular physic.   "You know who murdered that man and why were you there?" she asked him.  "I am not telling you anything, you betrayed me and now you want my help? When you decide to take the place beside me then I will help you all you want."  "Your dead, do you want me to kill myself to be with you?" she asked.  "You should know Mystic Shadow you cannot kill an immortal," he told her as he walked away from her and into the black clouds with the lightening bolts striking all around them.  Cheyenne was being shaken a wake by Roger. "What is it Roger?" she asked trying to come fully a wake.  "We got a match on those prints; they belong to a woman who has been dead for over ten years." He told her as she sat up in bed." Do you think it's a demon?" he asked.  "I will try to find out." She told him as she got out of bed. "I need the woman's name." she told him getting out of bed in her long white silk nightgown.  Roger looked at Cheyenne feeling sad and lonely. "You look just as you did fifteen years ago, some of us are aging and feeling our ages." He told her.  "If I had my choice in this I would have chosen to grow old with You. Instead I will live an eternity lonely." She told him not realizing what she had told him looking depressed by her thought.  Roger smiled realizing it was a slip of the tongue because she was still tired. He knew now she did love him. His hands began to shake knowing she loved him after all. "Her name is Sarah Diego she was murdered ten years ago by her abusive husband." He told her showing her the picture and not letting her know she just gave him the secret of her heart.  Cheyenne had a vision of a person using her image right down to every detail of this woman." it has to be an evil witch because my vision of her has been blocked from being able to identify her." She told him. "If we can catch her while she is using the woman's identity literally speaking then I would be able to drag her out and vanquish her." She told him trying to wake up.  "I will let you go back to sleep Cheyenne." he told her as she looked extremely tired.  "Thanks I don't know why I can't wake up, it's like I took a sleeping pill and I didn't." she said falling back onto the bed. She fell to sleep instantly. Roger covered her up before he left the room.  Cheyenne found herself back in the room, she saw cracks in the floor opening up filled with lightening bolts coming up at her. Cheyenne had to jump over the cracks so they could not hit her." Stop it Gore warrior! Stop it!" she yelled out as she saw him walk out of the clouds.  "I did not do this!" He said looking around at the ground seeing it was ready to cave in with Cheyenne, running to her he picked her up in his arms as she wrapped her arms around his neck." someone wants you dead very badly." He told her as they looked into each others eyes.  " You know why you can not get me out of your thoughts? The same as I can not get you out of mine our blood mixed making us joined together for eternity." He said holding her hand up showing her the scar on their hands as he held her tighter in his arms.  "You were destroyed. You're just a spirit now." She told him feeling his face so close to her lips, his lip's almost touching hers. She fought hard to fight his spell he had on her.  "only my shell you destroyed, unlike Fredrick I am your real demon, and you sent me to this place of no where except lightening and clouds to watch the souls come in." he said then kissing her lips.   Cheyenne tried to pull away from him, he was to strong for her to stop him finally he stopped as she looked in his eyes." let me go Gore warrior please." She asked him.  "All you have to do is wake up and you will be away from me, unless you really don't want to wake up that is." He said kissing her again then Cheyenne woke her self up touching her lips as she could still feel his lips as if they were still on hers.  About that time Fredrick came popping in to her room." I got some news on Gore warrior, the council of darkness has doomed him to 100 years of solitude or until he destroys you. Because he lost the battle to you that day. You know your wedding day." He said taunting her slightly.   "He could have let me been electrocuted tonight but saved me." She told Fredrick.  "I guess he is getting soft." He told her shrugging his shoulders.  So he cannot come into the world, but he did the other night." She said looking seriously at Fredrick.  "His spirit can come, but he can't do anything to anyone." He told her. "Unless of course he projects himself into a body," he told her looking worried. "But it won't last long; he is not allowed to dwell in human form." He told her trying to convince him self that Gore warrior was helpless.  "Thanks for the information Frederick. I need to get some sleep though." She told him.  'that's ok I got a hot date with twin sisters tonight." He told her disappearing.  Cheyenne smiled as she thought of him the Romeo of the ghost world. She lay in her bed wondering why he saved her when he could have released himself from his hell.  Gore warrior's spirit appeared in Gina's room he knew she was the one trying to destroy Cheyenne. that she was able to gain her powers through sex and killing her victim like the black widow spider, He pulled the sheet back exposing her nude body. Gore warrior raised his hands over her body watching as she began to glow brighter while her powers were entering him.  "No! "She yelled." who has stolen my powers?" she demanded to know when she looked into the mirror where Gore warrior was laughing at her.  He knew I tried to kill Cheyenne to make it look like him and this is his way of punishing me. Damn it she thought to herself as her powers were almost diminished." I will leave her alone! Just leave me alone please." She begged him.  Gore warrior learned he could do things to people in his spirit form, now that he collected her powers he could do more. Smiling at his new found knowledge decided to cause some chaos among the mortals. He began raping women while they slept in their beds next to their husbands; too afraid to say anything because they could not see anything they questioned their mental stability. If two men were standing in an elevator he would touch one of the men's buttocks causing them to fist fight. He waited for Hanks return home from camping before he would cause problems there.  The first night home Cheyenne and Hank made love to each other as Gore warrior watched with out their knowledge of him being in the room. After they had fallen to sleep Gore warrior crept under the covers performing oral sex on Cheyenne as she slept. Cheyenne was moaning in her sleep waking Hank as he watched his wife having sex in her sleep only when she came to an orgasm did she wake up seeing Hank looking at her curiously.  "What just happened to you Cheyenne?" he asked wanting to know why she just experienced a sexual moment.  "I don't know, I guess I was dreaming of you." She said trying to figure out what had just happened since she was not even dreaming.  "Were you dreaming of me or was it of your lover Gore warrior!?" he asked as he had never seen her body come so alive before, so sensual. He knew it was Gore warrior.  "What are you crazy? Gore warrior, my lover?" I killed him why would I have killed him if he was my lover? I haven't killed you!" she yelled at him not believing what she was hearing.  "You told me you loved him, you told me you had sex with him!" he yelled as he got out of their bed.  "I also told you that I have had sexual contact with other demons or warlocks to vanquish them are they my lovers too?" she asked feeling rage build within her.  "No I guess it makes you a murderous whore." He said as he stormed out of the room.  Gore warrior was very pleased with the chaos he just caused between Cheyenne and Hank. Keep up with those words soon she'll be back in my arms where she will stay for eternity. He thought to himself as he watched the whole fight being undetected by Cheyenne.  Now he knew that not even the witches could detect his presence.  Cheyenne sat there not moving or saying a word as the words Hank cut into her heart like a knife. Cheyenne got out of bed using her magic she dressed her self looking around the room a tear rolled slowly down her face. She appeared in Aggatha's room.  For only a second did her tear affect Gore warrior emotionally, he actually experienced a moment of guilt.  "I am going away for a while watch my son and Gina." She told the woman.  "Where are you going? "Aggatha asked her feeling something was wrong.  I have an assignment." She said avoiding Aggatha's eyes.  "I didn't get any orders from the council." She told Cheyenne.  Cheyenne just looked at the woman with the saddest look Aggatha had ever seen on her face then she vanished.  Cheyenne appeared in her bed room at the manor where it was cold and lonely. Just the way she was feeling at the moment. She walked to the window to look out at the night so still and beautiful with the stars sparkling. Tears rolled down her face." I did not ask for this role in my life, but it was given to me. I do my work no matter how I have to do it even if it means sleeping with the one I am suppose to kill. So yes then I guess I am a murderous whore!" she said to herself as she cried to the heavens when a bright light appeared in the room. It was an elderly man dressed in a white long robe with long white hair and a white beard that touched his stomach.  "Who are you? She asked through her tears.  "I am from the council my name is Ezekiel. Do not let tonight distract you from your work Cheyenne you are needed to do this work with out you we would be in a world of trouble." He told her.  " You have gone through this for almost sixteen years, remember true love does hurt, does not speak with hurtful words. Is not jealous, You have not completed you destiny and you will know when you have finally achieved true harmony with your mate." He told her in such a kind voice." but do be aware there is an entity out there causing chaos amongst the mortals raping women, causing fights between men in public places and we cannot locate who or what it is." He told her. "Rest my child you have a battle coming up soon." He told her as he vanished.  Cheyenne sat at the window for hours as she watched the sun rising in the sky it made everything so different looking. The seven other women appeared behind her.  "So you think you can just go on Vacation with out us?" Alicia asked her.  "Don't you know how to knock?" Cheyenne asked them.  "Knock- knock "Patty said as she sat in the air." What is going on Cheyenne?" she asked as the other's sat floating sitting crossed legged.  "Hank and I had a fight because I had an orgasm in my sleep, he accused me of thinking of my lover Gore warrior, he called me a murderous whore and here I am." She told them as Gloria materialized hot cup's of coffee.  "I am glad I am not married to a mortal or anything because there are things we have to do to accomplish what has to be done. Not that it's right, but it's how we have to work it." Cathy said.  "Saunders has been asking questions lately too like a jealous husband." Lindsey told them.  "Maybe in our work we are not meant to be married or attached to anyone or anything." Cheyenne told them.  "Your not serious Cheyenne, you love Hank with all of your heart." Margaret told her not believing what she heard.  "I am serious, I am thinking of asking for a divorce so he can have some what of a normal life while he is still on earth." Cheyenne told them as the women sat silent not wanting to accept that there could possibly be no more Hank and Cheyenne.  "Don't decide until you talk to Hank it's only fair." Gloria told her.  Cheyenne looked at her with tear filled eyes. "is it fair that he is married to a witch? who bore a powerful demons child, who is bonded to this demon for eternity?" she asked as she held her hand up showing them the scar on her hand. " and yes who at one time had feeling's for this demon? " She asked them crying.  "Do you still have feelings for him Cheyenne?" Tammy asked her.  Cheyenne looked up at the ceiling closing her eyes as the tears came.  " I fight any feelings I had because I know it would be my own destruction and everyone else's along with it. "She cried into her hands.  " I know its some spell he has on me and I fight it like hell! I know he is not the one who has branded my heart." She blurted out to the other witches as tears streaked her face. "I will never be able to hold him ever again, to let him know that I have not stopped loving him. I made a commitment to Hank who say's hurtful words to me. "she said wiping her tears away with both hands. "sometimes I think I should go and surrender to Gore warrior." She told them trying to pull her self together.  The witches were not aware that Gore warrior was there listening to everything being said he smiled to himself knowing he was causing the destruction he wanted to happen between Hank and Cheyenne, but who owned her heart if not him self?  "You still love Roger." Cathy told her.  "Yes with all my heart and soul. I have known since my so-called wedding night to Gore warrior, it was Roger's voice I heard calling to me breaking the spell. I love him and can never be with him because I made a promise to make it work with Hank." She told them the truth crying.  The seven witches felt shocked at the news of her unconditional love for Roger. They were not sure how to react to it.  Tammy looked at Cheyenne. "Roger loves you and you love him, is it fair that you have made him live with out you? "she asked Cheyenne." To make him finish his life here on earth, with out his soul mate?" she asked putting her arm around Cheyenne's shoulder. "Never to know that his love is being returned by the woman he has devoted his life too?" Tammy asked Cheyenne holding her now tightly as she cried hysterically.  Cheyenne looked at her and then the six other witches. "What have I done?" she asked them through her tear-filled eyes.  Cathy stood in front of the two witches.  "It's time to get your life in order. You can't run away from it." She told her gently.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 10 by Erotica_Writings ©  The day had come for Gore warrior and Cheyenne’s ceremony. She knew she would have to get him back to their room alone to kill him while the other women kept the others celebrating until Cheyenne could get back to help destroy the others. The witches dressed Cheyenne in a long black gown that cut deep into her cleavage. Long tight fitting sleeves. The waistline was very tight then spread out over her hips into a long sweeping gown. A black cape over her shoulders with her hair up on her head. A diamond beaded headband encrusted with diamond teardrops dangling from it caressing her forehead, she wore long delicate diamond earrings hanging that softly touched her shoulders. Her shoes were black spiked heels, as she looked in the mirror she was nervous for this is the day that she would wed Gore warrior to kill him in their wedding bed.  Gore warrior’s men came to bring Cheyenne to the place of the ceremony by calling her by her birth name Mystic Shadow.  As Cheyenne walked with the men on each side of her leading her down steep stairs, to a huge room filled with candles, Gore warrior stood in the middle of a circle lit with candles as the star on the floor was glowing bright. They placed Cheyenne in the middle with Gore warrior, Cheyenne looked around as she did not see her son which she was relieved he was not there, the other women stood watching the ceremony between Gore warrior and Mystic Shadow as Duskshroud read from a book in a language that she had not heard before. Cheyenne saw a golden knife handed to Gore warrior where he cut his hand then Cheyenne’s as he took both of their cuts mixing their blood together then handing the knife back to Duskshroud where he wiped the blood on a cloth. “Gore warrior and Mystic Shadow you are now bound together forever.” He told them as everyone cheered at the union.  Gore warrior picked her up in his arms carrying her to their wedding bed which was dimly lit by candles, the bed draped with black veils, something was happening to Cheyenne she felt strange wanting Gore warrior as she undressed for him , he laid naked on the bed and began to pleasure her orally with his serpent tongue, he raised his body on top of hers where he entered her Cheyenne was trying to stay focus, but she was being dragged more into Gore warrior’s body and soul, it must be the mixing of our blood I am weakening to him. She thought to herself. He placed her on top of him as she rode him slowly as her head rolled slowly in a circle letting her hair down; she looked into his glowing eyes.  “I love you Gore warrior.” She told him as she rubbed her hands over his chest giving into him as her body was being pleasured by his the passion began to get hotter.   I want to stay with him! She thought to herself as she felt as they were becoming one. Fight it! You have to fight it! It was Rogers’s voice she heard whispering to her. As she slowly moved on top of him, she removed one of her earrings. “I love you.” She told him as tears filled her eyes she poured the vanquishing potion on him that they placed in the earring and flew from the bed. He burst into flames and lightening bolts shot from the spot he had been laying in. Changing back into her warrior out fit she walked out to where the other women saw her emerge, they too changed into their outfits. The first one Cheyenne killed was Duskshroud as she had a lightening bolt rip him in half. The other witches were killing the demons using their powers to sever their throats and then each one would rip out their hearts. Cheyenne had Gore warrior’s mistress up in the air and threw her into a wall smashing her head open then cutting out her heart. The women had successfully destroyed everyone in the castle.   The women looked at Cheyenne “you know you are the Queen of darkness now.” They told her watching a sorrow cross Cheyenne’s face.   Cheyenne looked seriously with her heart miles away. “I will continue to destroy evil as long as I am alive.” She told them looking back where she had just vanquished the man she had been joined to for eternity. A single teardrop rolled down her face.  “You did cut out his heart Cheyenne?” they asked her.  “I vanquished him.” She told them as she collected her son taking him back to the house where everyone waited for their return.  Cheyenne looked at Hank as she held her son in her arms.” I think we should name him Alexander.” She smiled at him.  “I like Alexander.” he told her sensing strangeness about her now.  That night as they lay in bed and she told him everything about the seductions, the ceremony. She looked at Hank with tears.” He almost had succeeded in taking me over; thank God, I was able to fight it, to fight off his power. I told him I loved him before I vanquished him.” She told as she remembered that night.  “Did you love him?” Hank asked her as he laid on his side holding his head with up his hand.  “Yes at that moment I did, but then something brought me out of it and I killed him.” She told him as she felt almost a loss towards Gore warrior’s demise, and keeping from him it was Roger’s voice that brought her back knowing the truth that her love and heart would always belong to him. However, being she had made a commitment with Hank, she would try to make it work.  That night Hank and Cheyenne made love together for the first time in almost a year since she found out that she was pregnant. They reunited that night as man and wife to live together raising Alexander and Gina together. Saunders and Lindsey were married that summer. While Roger dated women out of the house hold.  Cheyenne and the other witches traveled all over destroying evil as Hank, Roger, Saunders, Aggatha, and Norma held down the home front. They knew it was what they were chosen to do in life.    Cheyenne enjoyed watching the children grow through the years.  At eighteen years old, Gina made the cheer leading squad in high school. Alexander was in the boy scouts, he loved spending those times with Hank. Hank now sixty years old was growing and looking older as his wife still looked forty-five years old and her body was in better shape then ever.  Gina’s body began to develop more advance then some of the girls her age, the science teacher began to pay more attention to her keeping her after school and rewarding her with gifts when she got an A in his glass. The teacher was almost 60 year’s old balding and fat with thick rimmed glasses. One day when Gina came into file paper work for him she was in her cheerleader’s uniform. He had been trying to get Gina to let him take her home and today he was going to make up some thing to get her to his house.” Gina how would you like to make fifty dollars today?”  Gina smiled at the thought of fifty dollars to spend.” Sure what do I have to do?” she asked him as she stood in front of him smiling with a sparkle in her eye.  “Will you model for me Gina?” He asked as was getting excited looking at her well developed body.  “Sure let’s go.” she said smiling pulling her long brown hair back into a ponytail.  Inside of his house she looked around as it was messy.” Where is your wife?” she asked him looking at the pictures of other girls from her school.  “She died long ago. Now would you mind posing nude for me Gina?” he asked as he got closer to her.  The thought made her excited; after all she did have Gore warrior’s blood flowing through her veins. ”Alright.” She said as she began to remove her clothes. She stood in front of him naked as he stared at her young body.  He reached out cupping her breast and she did not stop him. He pulled her to him fondling her as he kissed her laying her down on the couch where he took her virginity. The feelings he was giving to her as he molested her began to drive Gina wild, her eyes began to glow and she bit into his neck causing him to bleed. He tried to get away from her, but she had turned completely evil and hideous looking with huge demon looking ears, horns protruding from the top of her head with long stringy brown hair. She grabbed him by his arm when he tried to run from her as his flesh hung from his neck. Gina had strength beyond belief, she threw him on the ground and straddled him. ”Pleasure me or die now!” she growled in a demonic voice. The sexual sensations began to drive her crazy; she grabbed a knife off the coffee table plunging it into his heart and ate it as she laughed. Before leaving she took the fifty dollars Out of his wallet.” Thanks teach, I guess we won’t be playing together anymore.” She said as she laughed at the dead man lying there. Gina became like a drug addict she wanted more sex, at night while everyone slept she would sneak out the of the house looking for men who were looking for prostitutes, as they had sex with her she would go wild plunging the knife into their hearts that she carried with her now. Each killing made her more evil, she knew where the police were looking on certain nights because she would listen to Saunders and Roger where the stings would be set up to catch the serial killer who they knew had to be a prostitute doing the killings.  Gina discovered on one killing that she too had powers when she flung a man up in the air hitting the ceiling so hard it cracked. She laughed wickedly as he laid on the floor in pain.” pleasure me now or it will get worse.” She told the man smiling as he forced himself to pleasure the she devil from hell. As soon as she was done with one movement of her hand she was able to cut off his head. ”Oops I lied to you didn’t I?” she asked sarcastically laughing seeing his head severed from his body. The more she killed while having sex it seemed the more powerful she would get. She looked in the man’s bathroom mirror and she smiled at her self.” One day I will claim my throne, I am the Princess of Darkness. It was my destiny until Gore warrior took it away from me. I am glad Cheyenne killed the swine, it is a shame I will have to kill her one day.” She said brushing her hair as she looked in the mirror when she saw her face melting. ”What is happening? “She asked herself aloud when she heard a demonic laughter as if it was surrounding her very being. Fear surged through her body and she ran out of the room stepping over the dead man’s body when he grabbed her ankle causing her to fall.  ” You dumb bitch so you’re glad I am dead? And you think you will rule the dark side?” the dead man said in a demonic voice.  Fear filled her body. ” Gore warrior your dead, she killed you!” she cried out as she tried to get away.  “Looks like I am here.” he said pulling her closer to the man she had just killed.” You tell anyone about me and I will kill you.” He threatened her as she broke loose from his grip running from the house. His demonic spirit left the man's body as he watched her run away. She could hear his evil laughter all the way home.  As his spirit floated into the air and out of the house he looked towards Cheyenne’s house.  ” You told me you love me Cheyenne, which is what spared your life, that is until I decide for you to join me again.” He said smiling as he disappeared into the night.  Gina was frightened of Gore warrior even in spirit he was still powerful she found out. How could his spirit even survive Cheyenne’s attack on him? She thought to herself. She ran home hoping he was not coming after her, once in her room she buried her face into her pillow to muffle her cries so no one would hear her to question her.  That night as Cheyenne slept, she began to dream she was in a dark room wearing her long teal nightgown that resembled a peasants dress but made of satin and trimmed in a dark green lace. she saw a man whom she felt like she knew.” who are you?” she asked as he never looked at her, but kept walking away .She ran up to him grabbing him by the arm but her hand went right though him.” stop who are you?” she demanded as the man kept walking away when she had a strange feeling come over her.” No I vanquished you.” She said as he turned around it was Gore warrior. “I am just a dream Cheyenne, you dream of me because you love me isn’t that true?” he asked her.  “Once I thought I did Gore warrior, but I vanquished you fighting those feelings.” She told him.  “You miss how I made your body feel when I mated with you.” He told her.” But I am a dream and in the dream world I can’t touch you, it’s just a dream.” He said touching her face.  “You’re alive.” She said looking at him wide eyed as her hand touched his taking it off her face.  “I am in the spirit world because you love me; you did not completely succeed in my death.” He told her looking deep in her eyes.” We will be together one day Cheyenne.” He told her as he walked into the clouds with lightening bolts.  She stood there watching him go into the clouds feeling anger with her self for letting him get close to her emotions. “Damn it.” She said as she was coming out of the dream.  That morning Cheyenne sipped on her coffee at the kitchen table in her long white robe as Hank and Alex were getting ready to go camping with Alex’s troop for the week end. She was happy that Alex did not show any of his father’s demonic signs. Alex loved Hank and called him dad. Gina came to where Cheyenne was sitting at the table eating a bagel for breakfast.  “Where are they going?” Gina asked Cheyenne as she bit into her bagel.  “camping for the week end and are your Jean’s tight enough? “ she asked looking at the girls hip hugging jeans with a half shirt.  ” no their not and I am just hanging out at Beth’s this week end.” She told her.  “Thank you for asking if you could stay.” Cheyenne told her sarcastically.    “Well can I stay Cheyenne?” she asked rolling her eyes.  “I guess it would be alright; we have a mission to go do, so I don’t see why not.” She told her.  “What are you doing?” Gina asked.  “Trying to help catch the prostitute who is killing the men she picks up.” She told her sipping on her coffee not noticing her face change expressions.  “How are you going to do it?” she asked trying to act normal so Cheyenne would not wonder why she wanted to know.  “I am going to go visit the crime scenes and see if I get a vision of course.” She told her.  Gina finished her breakfast then kissed Cheyenne good bye as she ran upstairs to get her stuff. Cheyenne thought that was weird since she has never shown anyone any affection.  Once Gina was in her room she cast a spell to keep her invisible from those who are looking for her in the killings.” hope it works.” She said to herself as she threw some clothes in a bag and left for the week end of killing.  After Hank and Alex had left she called for Fredrick once she was in her bedroom. As he appeared in front of her he could tell she was upset.” Why did you keep it from me that Gore warrior is in the spirit world?” she asked him.  “I didn’t know he was.” He replied shocked by the news he just heard. “I thought you got rid of him completely?” He asked her.  “He came to me in a dream last night.” She told him.  “You saw him?” he asked her being surprised by this.  Cheyenne eyes began to mist, “He said because I fell in love with him is what kept him from leaving completely.” She told him.  ” Just as it was my love that kept me here right?” He asked sarcastically, “it was not your love; it was his for you that kept him in the spirit world.” He told her.  “Gore warrior was capable of loving anything or anyone besides himself?” she asked him.  “I guess he fell in love with you my dear daughter, we have that effect on demons and witches you know.” He told her smiling trying to figure out why he had not seen him.  “Don’t put me in the same league as you or I will send you somewhere cold, very cold.” She told him being disgusted that he was even her father. “I feel better knowing I didn’t cause him to be in the spirit world. He did it to him self.” She said realizing that she did not destroy him.   “Why haven’t you run into him?” she asked Fredrick.  “Well maybe we associate with in different circles, mine being the more debonair and his being more of the bar room brawlers type. “He told her with his hands on his hips, his head tilted back slightly as he stood there in his black suit. “How should I know why we have not ran into each other? It’s a large spirit world I guess.” He told her.  “Father, keep your eyes open for him and tell me if you see him?” she asked him as he sat with his legs crossed floating in the air.” Now go so I can get dressed.” She told him.  “I promise I won’t peek.” He said putting his hand over his eyes peeking through the cracks of his fingers.  “Go on leave!” she said throwing a pillow at him.  “Fine I know when I am not wanted.” He said vanishing.  Gina had checked into a seedy motel for the week end, she decided to change her appearance so she looked through a magazine to find someone to change into. She came across a woman who had been murdered ten years ago.” Guess you won’t mind me using your looks to do these crimes since it was a man who killed you.” She said looking at the woman’s picture. Taking the picture she turned her appearance into the woman’s with short red hair, green eyes, very thin with large breast.” You had to have a boob job done.” She said aloud to herself Slipping into a pair of blue denim shorts cut very short and were tight, with a black halter top with just a string for the back, she put on a pair of spiked heels.” Not bad, this should be a great week end and shock the police that a dead woman is committing the crime’s.” she said to her self laughing as she looked into the mirror. Once darkness came, she went out into the street where she was picked up by a trucker, he was young, blond hair and blue eyes, tall and thin built.  ” hey little lady looking for some fun?” he asked calling out to her from inside the truck.  “Does your truck have a bed?” she asked him licking her lips.  “Sure does have a bed.” He told her smiling.  “Do you have fifty dollar’s?” she asked rubbing her hands over her breast.  “I sure do! “ He told her with an ear-to-ear grin. “Climb on up in here little lady.” He said opening up the trucks door for her.  Once inside the truck she directed him to a secluded area where no one would see them. As they undressed, she got in the bed where she got on top of him, as they began to have sex she felt the energy building inside of her and transformed into her demon body looking more hideous each time she gained more powers. He looked up at her when he heard her growling and felt green slime dropping on to his face. He began screaming in terror trying to escape her. Her nails turned into razors when she exploded into an orgasm. With an eerie scream slashed him repeatedly in a crazed frenzy. There was blood all over the place including her own blood. She stepped out of the truck with her clothes on she was bloody she cleaned herself up using her magic. As she was walking down the street back to the motel, six high school boys stopped her then pulling her into the car.  “We’re going to have a good time with you tonight.” the one boy said with red hair and braces as he squeezed her breast. The boys dragged her out into the woods where they took turns raping her, this made her powers even stronger as she was enjoying the pleasure from them, her eyes began to glow as she reached her climax killing them all by severing there head with her new razor like nails. She began laughing at the sight of them. She sat each boy’s head on their laps. ” I think I had a very good time with you tonight.” She said smiling taking off in their car and parking it at a local bar.  Once back at the motel she turned back into her self.” Wow I worked up a hunger tonight.” She said ordering a pizza and showered while she waited for it. She felt very elated in her night of killing. She sat smugly feeling she had even fooled the great Cheyenne about her. She thought back to the little girl at school she killed as she fingered the necklace around her neck she still had. “I’ve gotten much better at killing.” She said laughing to her self.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 09 by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne sat up in her bed still reeling from the nightmare she had just experienced with Gore warrior. "Oh sweet Jesus what have I done? When I told him I would not go with him he pushed me into the graves, and hands came up from the graves trying to drag me inside." She told them as Hank took her into his arms.  Cheyenne was fearful to fall back to sleep for fear Gore warrior would bring her back to him. For the first time she actually feared him. As the night past Cheyenne laid awake watching Hank sleep. She got out of bed to sit by the window to watch the sun come up.  Gina was becoming more of a handful to handle since she found out her father had taken her destiny away from her. She was hurting children in school and the schools asked that she not come back.  Aggatha had to home school her where she would throw things at her. Gina's hate for the baby grew more every day as she watched Cheyenne's stomach grow. Gina wished her father and baby brother would die together. Gina became so violent that Roger and Saunders took her to the scared straight program by the local prison. She laughed at the female and male prisoners when they tried to intimidate her. They told the two men that she was dangerous now and would grow more dangerous when she got older. The little girl was born without a conscious. Roger and Saunders looked at each other worriedly.   Gina began to have moments that she acted possessed. She literally was extremely angry. Growling as if she was a wild animal. They would have to restrain her until the doctor was able to administer a potion to her. She confirmed Aggatha worse fears that the demon was growing stronger with in the evilness of the child consuming her and her mind. The potions only kept the demon dormant temporarily.  "The ninth month."  Cheyenne's water broke as she was walking to the kitchen. "Aggatha it is time for the doctor. " She told her as she sat on a chair.  "I will summons the doctor." She told her as they moved her to basement.  Everyone gathered down stairs in the basement that had been prepared for the birth of Cheyenne's baby. They put her in a bed to have the birth in; everything was sterilized for the birth, Cathy was preparing the bed for the baby to be placed in when it was born.  The contractions were coming quick as Cheyenne would push when the doctor told to her.  "This is going to be a quick birth." the doctor told Cheyenne.  Hank stood on one side of Cheyenne as Roger stood on the other side of her each holding her hand, as she would grip them tight with each contraction.  "Oh my God this hurts so much!" she cried as she was trying to bare the pain.  "Not as much as it hurts me." Roger said when Cheyenne gripped his hand with all of her might.  "Push Cheyenne, push I see his head." the doctor told her.  "I can't push I am so tired." She cried out from the pain and exhaustion she was feeling.  "Push Cheyenne do as you're told." Aggatha told her.  Cheyenne began to scream as the baby was coming out." Get it out! Get it out!" she screamed as the pain felt like it was tearing her in two. Then it stopped when he came out of Cheyenne. The doctor handed him to Cheyenne. "He is so beautiful," she said looking at her son in her arms as she nursed him her milk from her breast.   Suddenly a strong wind began to blow Cheyenne knew it was Gore warrior and his army. He appeared next to Cheyenne looking at his son suckling from Cheyenne's breast. His men were surrounding her from the others. "It is time to go Cheyenne," he told her looking at the son they had created together.  "No we are not going with you Gore warrior." She said holding her son tightly to her as she tried to send him away with her hand only to have him grab her hand taking their son from her. The other women were battling Gore warrior's army but there were too many of them for the women to hold off .Gore warrior leaned over Cheyenne kissing her before he vanished taking her baby with him. Roger tried to grab him but he Gore warrior had vanished before he could reach him.  "Damn it!" Roger yelled realizing that he was to late in saving the baby.  "No!" Cheyenne screamed as they all left with her son." No don't take my little boy." Cheyenne cried as she struggled to get out of bed, she became aware of Gina standing there crying. "Gina..." Cheyenne said as her heart bore the child's pain as well.   Gina looked at Cheyenne through tear-filled eyes. "He left me, He lied to me, and he said he would take me when he came back!" She cried as Cheyenne took her into her arms holding her as they both cried.  Six weeks had past since the birth of her son she spent many hours in her room crying over her loss. Aggatha came to her." you need to turn your depression into anger and start the battle now Cheyenne or you will never get your son back." She told her knowing that if she did not snap out of her depression he would win the battle.  "Cheyenne looked at her strangely." Your right Aggatha I do." She said as she called everyone to her room." It is time we go back to the house and prepare for battle." She told them as they all stood around her and then vanished reappearing at the house.  The women went outside where they worked out getting their bodies back in shape. In the evening they spent hours making potions and spells strong enough to vanquish the strongest of evil. They summoned Cheyenne's parents from the other world to give them details of what to expect. The women had every spell, potion, and details down to a fine art.  Cheyenne called upon Fredrick to tell them where their caverns are. They drew maps of each one. Cheyenne swore she would search the world until she found her son.  The women all dressed in black leather vest and pants, black boots, with black leather straps with silver studs on each wrist, they each had their charm around their necks and bathed in the oils.  The women traveled alone since they traveled by their magic beaming into a place as they battled any evil supernatural being that they crossed paths with. When they entered one cavern located in the woods of Virginia they found some of Gore warrior's men raping young girls and killing them when they had finished abusing the young terrified girls.  Cheyenne blasted the door open with lightening bolts as she entered a gust of wind blew in as the women's hair flew loosely around their face and in the air, with out a word the women killed the demons by blowing them up with crystal energy balls . With the demons gone the girls who were still alive looked at the women as they walked out without a word just as they had walked in then vanished into the night." Who were those women?" they asked each other before they lost their memory of the warriors of the White Light.  Cheyenne had to separate the part of her that was in love with Hank, the one who was gentle had to become the most vindictive witch known to man kind she became Mystic Shadow warrior and High Priestess of the White Light. She had located Rip snake in Las Vegas in a hotel room pleasuring him self with prostitutes. Mystic Shadow told the other women she wanted this one herself to keep watch for any of his comrades. she turned her outfit into one of the sleaziest dresses , it was white with straps that just covered her breast then a small piece of material covering her stomach then opening around her hips, cutting just above her buttocks with an open back, she wore white spiked heels and carried a vanquishing potion in her evening bag. As she walked into the room, finding him in bed with a woman Mystic Shadow smiled.  "Time for you to go now, we have business." She told the woman who looked at Rip snake.  He nodded his head for her to leave. As the woman was dressing, Mystic Shadow let her dress drop to the ground revealing just a pair of white lace panties. He was captured by the lust as she dropped her panties to the floor. Mystic Shadow climbed into the bed with the man who had a foul smell, his teeth yellowing; his black hair was slimy looking.  "I will give you what you have wanted if you tell me what I want to know." She said as she straddled him feeling his hardness against her throbbing." tell me where Gore warrior is and I will pleasure you all night she told him feeling him enter her as she moved her body slowly .  "Oh man you are so hot you fucking witch bitch! No wonder Gore warrior is so crazy about you. " he told her feeling the pleasure of her body on his.  "Tell me now," she said leaning over pressing her large breast in his face as she licked his ear lobes.  "He is at the old house in Europe with the boy," he told her as he grabbed her hips." Your better then I fantasized about." He told her, as his breathing was getting heavier, he was feeling pleasures he never felt before.  Mystic Shadow leaning her body backwards as he grinded deeper in her body she grabbed her bag and the potion then poured it on him.  " You're really a bad fuck and that just pist me off!" She said getting off him he started to disintegrate laughing at the evil little man. Changing back in to her warrior outfit, she smiled where the vile man had once lain.  As Mystic Shadow and the other witches were walking out of the motel they saw six of Rip snake's comrades coming down the street the eight women standing in a line blocking the side walk blew them up pointing their hands at them.  "So what happened up there?" Lindsey asked her as they vanished off the street and into another hotel room where they would stay for the night." He was a bad fuck so I made him disappear with our potion." She told them smiling." We are going to Europe tomorrow that is where Gore warrior is with my baby boy. We need to summon Fredrick to find out where it is." She said as she called out for Fredrick.  Soon he appeared in front of them." You have a bad case of timing Cheyenne I was just putting the move on this cute little nurse who died a week ago when you called, so it better be good." He told her.  "Even as a ghost you're trying to get laid." Cathy told him.  "You should try me some time." He told her winking as he smiled at her.  "Where is the old house in Europe Fredrick?" Cheyenne asked.  "It's a castle in France." he told her.  "Tell them its exact location I am going to wash this scum off of me from Rip snake." She told them going to the shower.  "She didn't do what I think she did?" he asked them looking sickly.  They nodded their heads in agreement with the same look of disgust.  "Damn that is what I call determined to get what she wants." He said as he gave them the directions and then vanished.  Cheyenne came out of the Shower with her robe on under it she wore a black lace teddy." Do you have the potion to make me sexually attracted to Gore warrior?" she asked the women sitting on her bed.  Gail looked at her with a worry look." Are you sure this is what you want to do?" she asked handing her the bottle of potion.  "I have to or he'll sense he is being set up and will never let me near my son, it will only be for a month that we convince him we have joined him." She told them as she drank the potion." If I start screaming or you feel I am in danger bring me out of the dream.  As Cheyenne fell into a deep sleep summoning Gore warrior to her in a room lit with candles and incense, a large bed where she sat waiting for him to appear. Gore warrior stood in front of her." what trick are you planning witch?" he asked looking at her voluptuous body.  "none I have come to you in the dream since we are both powerless to tell you I want to be your Queen" she said walking up close to him pulling off his shirt as she licked his chest." I love Milk chocolate." she told him as she massaged his chest." kiss me Gore warrior." She told him as her hand ran down to the front of his pants caressing him as she pulled his pants off with her other hand.  He took her into his arms kissing her as both of their passion ignited even more than before. "Cheyenne." he called her name as he kissed and licked her neck. "Don't try to trick me or I will eat your heart out!" he told her grabbing the back of her hair forcing her to look into his eyes.  "I am not trying to trick you, can't you feel my passion and feelings for you?" she asked him trying to convince him that she was sincere.  Gore warrior could not resist her any longer taking her with such force on the bed. She ran her hands all over his back as he devoured her in a heat of passion "Cheyenne I had waited for this moment." He told her in her ear." I have wanted you since the first time I saw you." He said kissing her breast as she moaned from him pleasuring her as her body moved in rhythm with his.  "Gore warrior! Oh my love!" she said as they exploded with such an orgasm as she held onto him with her arms wrapped around his neck.  He looked into her eyes. "Come to my bed tonight so I may pleasure you all night." he told her kissing her lips.  "I would have to bring my witches with me to serve us Gore warrior." She told him longing to see her son.  "Very well I will be waiting for you in my bed. Hurry to me my queen." He told her as he rose up off her body." I will be waiting." he told her as he kissed her softly then vanished.  When Cheyenne awoken the other women were standing around her. "We have to go tonight, this is going to be easier then I thought. After we have them believing we have converted, we will kill Gore warrior and his army of darkness." She told them.  The women stood in the middle of the castle where Gore warrior's mistress greeted them. "I will show you to Gore warrior and the rest of you to your rooms." She told them looking hateful at the women especially Cheyenne who had the one thing no woman could ever get from Gore warrior, his love.  Cheyenne walked into Gore warrior's room where he sat up in bed waiting for her arrival.  "Remove your clothing Cheyenne." He told her as he watched as she dropped the lace teddy to the floor as she stood naked in front of him. "Come to our bed my queen." He told her as he pulled back the covers for her to join him.  Cheyenne was happy that the potion worked for in his true demonic self was hideous looking." master I long for you so much, your touch, let me pleasure you ." she told him straddling him.  That entire night he ravished her body and shared his mistress with her. Cheyenne did whatever it took to convince him that she was his and had decided to be the queen of the dark side. Cheyenne bathed him the next morning in his huge tub as he took her again full filling his sexual appetite. "When are you taking me to see our son?" she asked him as she towel dried him.  "Get dressed and I will take you." He told her pointing at the closet full of black dresses that were all sleazy looking.  Gore warrior walked proudly down the hall with Cheyenne on his arm, as he opened the door to the nursery Cheyenne saw it was all black even the bassinette was in black lace. Cheyenne picked up her son wrapped in a black receiving blanket. She sat in the rocker and began to nurse him off her bosom that she kept from going dry by pumping her milk." Our son." She said and smiled looking up at Gore warrior. he smiled at the sight of his queen and the little prince together finally.  The other women had to pleasure the other demons to make them believe they were truly joining them in forces.  Later that day Cheyenne laid on the bed she shared with Gore warrior when he came busting into the room grabbing her up off the bed slapping her across the face. Her lip began to seep blood.  "You killed some of my comrades before coming here!" he yelled with gritted teeth pushing her down on the bed.  "They would not tell me where you were! They were keeping us apart Gore warrior!" She retorted back at him hoping to convince him.  "What about killing Rip snake while having sex with him?" he bellowed.  "No! He tricked me to his room telling me you were there and then he raped me! I had to kill him or be killed." She told him praying he believed her.  "If I find out you have lied I will kill all of you with pleasure!" he yelled at her as he saw her lying on the bed." He raped you. Let me show you rape." He yelled still angered by the news of the deaths of his comrades as he ripped her clothes off forcing her on her stomach as he sodomized her.  When Gore warrior had finished his assault on Cheyenne he kissed the back of her neck as he licked her back." Do not cross me my queen." He told her getting up from the bed looking down at her body-breathing heavy from his assault on her.  "I will never cross you Gore warrior, I love you, and I do." She said as tears ran down her face as she laid still on the bed.  "Get dressed now, I will be back later." He told her as he looked down where she laid crying feeling not one ounce of remorse for abusing her as he had just done.  "Yes Gore warrior, I will get dressed." She told him obediently.  She knew he was testing her for she would have blown him to oblivion any other time. She knew she had to put up with it until the time came for them to tear down his kingdom and she would take pleasure in killing him herself. As she walked through the castle she over heard Gore warrior, he was boasting to the others that the ceremony would be in three days. He did not want to wait any longer. So we will not be here as long as we thought we would be. she thought to herself smiling. Cheyenne crept cautiously into each witches room to inform them they need to prepare for battle in three days. The witches were ecstatic   Cheyenne dreaded the next three days for the demonic creatures would celebrate with sexual orgies, feasting on humans they had captured, using drugs on the victims then killing them by slitting their throats in the act of sexual intercourse so the feast on their flesh and organs could commence. They would have to participate or their cover be blown. Gore warrior passed Cheyenne around to each high comrade to pleasure her while the other women had to pleasure Gore warrior. When they sat down to feast, the eight witches cast a spell where the flesh disappeared before actually going into their mouths, an illusion of blood would drip from their mouths as if they had ate the human flesh. Not one demon was wiser, not even Gore warrior sitting next to Cheyenne.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 08 by Erotica_Writings ©  Once Hank was gone from the house Gore warrior read the deed learning where she was. He began laughing because he would be there before Hank when he heard Cheyenne summons him.” why is she sending for me?” he asked himself as he vanished.  Gore warrior materialized in Cheyenne’s bedroom at the other house. “Why are you summoning me Cheyenne?” he asked looking at her lying so beautiful in the bed.  “Are you not my master? Am I not your queen? Do we not share a son together who is in my stomach growing into a great warrior?” she asked looking seductively to throw him off track so that the others who were waiting to help destroy him.”  “You remember our union then?” he said going to the bed to where she laid.  “Yes Gore warrior I remember how you tricked me into being your queen.” She told him smiling up at him.  “Then you know you belong to me now and will serve me as your master.” He said lying next to her rubbing her stomach where their child laid protected from harm.  “Yes I do know.” She told him as she got out of the bed.  “Come back here and pleasure me now.” He ordered.  “No I do not feel like having your hands touching me ever again.” She told him turning to face him seeing the confusion on his face turning to anger as he realized she was going to blow him up when she doubled over grabbing her stomach in severe pain she dropped to her knees.” Oh my God my son! What is happening? “She asked as the pain became so severe she was crying.” Help me somebody, help me!” she yelled out as the pain was intolerable.  Gore warrior out of fear of losing his child’s life picked Cheyenne up in his arms laying her on the bed.  ” No this cannot be happening not now.” he said as Cheyenne laid in a ball on the bed with sever stomach cramps.  “Get Aggatha quickly or our son will parish.” She said crying, as the pain was intolerable.   Aggatha came to Cheyenne seeing her in pain she vanished to bring the doctor back. In a matter of minutes the doctor was there beside her.” Here drink this potion it will stop the pain. Gore warrior please leave the room.” She asked.  “No not when my son’s life is in jeopardy.” He said.  “Your presence is upsetting Cheyenne which is causing the pain.” The doctor told him.  Gore warrior left the room as the three began to whisper so he could not hear them.” The child is keeping you from killing his father. His death will have to wait until the child is born or loose the child.” The doctor told her.  Fredrick stood beside her bed.” it will have to wait since you’re the only one powerful enough to destroy him.” He told her sadly.  Aggatha tell Gore warrior to come here Fredrick disappear. ” Cheyenne said as the pain was easing.  “How is our son?” he asked her.  “Fine and if you want him to stay that way you must leave me alone until his birth, that means I do not want you anywhere around me .” she told him.  This angered Gore warrior as he grabbed her throat to strangle her.  ” Do not try and keep me from my son or I will kill you.” He told her looking more of a demon now then ever before.  Cheyenne sent him into the wall so hard with one swipe of her hand.” do not fuck with me Gore warrior or I will forget you are my son’s father. As far as any union you tricked me by getting me drunk and I do not recognize it.” She told him as he picked himself up off the floor.  “Your mine and you will be coming with me when our son is born.” He told her looking at her,” I will leave but the day of the birth I will return.” He said as he vanished from the house.  Cheyenne lay in the bed rubbing her stomach.” why must you keep me from destroying him my child? He will only destroy us and all that is good.” She said as she rubbed her stomach as Fredrick appeared beside her bed.” Fredrick why is the child protecting Gore warrior?” she asked her new comrade.  “Do not forget Cheyenne not only are you carrying a child that is part of you but of Gore warrior as well and that makes him warlock & demon.” He smiled as he looked at Cheyenne laying there so lovely just as her mother had many years ago.” it almost saddens me to look at you for you are your mothers image.” He told her becoming misty eyed.  “You loved her didn’t you?” She asked him seeing for the first time softness about Fredrick.  “We were lover’s Cheyenne and she became pregnant with my child, we were going to leave but then greed and power possessed me and I chose the dark side. Your mother could not give up her belief in the good she worked so hard for. So we went our own way. She met Murk shadow and he took her with the child as his. Your mother Charmelmystic named our daughter Mystic shadow after her and him. Mean while I became more evil with more power and went back to claim what was mine. Of course, she denied me and even tried to fight me, but out of anger I blasted her and the others killing them on the spot, they had placed their children and my daughter somewhere that I could not find them for protection, but I found them. I tried to destroy them, but it was I who was destroyed by my own man.” he looked at her waiting for a response from her.  “You’re my father , you raped me, you gave me to Gore warrior that night and you dare stand in front of me now?!” she asked feeling the anger grow inside of her.” I should send you to a place so barren for the rest of eternity. Why did you do that to me for?” she asked as tears ran down her face.  Fredrick looked at her seeing the pain but she had to know.” I had become mad Cheyenne remember I went completely demonic mating with ones family member was not uncommon, just unholy.” he told her.” you have my blood flowing through your body which makes you the powerful witch you are today. Just use it the right way and don’t give into the temptations of more power that will come your way.”  Cheyenne in total disbelief.” I find out I am bound to Gore warrior, carrying his child, I find out you are my father, what is going to come next?” she asked  “Aggatha is your grandmother." He told her.” she came with me as she watched me slaughter my whole family but she worked for me to keep me from you and I never knew for a moment she was a traitor, spy whatever you want to call her.” He explained to her as he floated from window to window.  Through her tears she looked at him.” anything else that has been hidden from me?” she asked afraid to hear if there was.  “No Cheyenne just use your knowledge to work for you for both of your parents were very powerful warriors as well as your stepfather.” He told her regretting the choices he had made in life.  Aggatha came to the door seeing Cheyenne crying.” you told her everything didn’t you Fredrick?” she asked him. “In death you become righteous?” She asked disgusted by him. ”someone wishes to see you Cheyenne.”  “Who wants to see me?” she asked as she wiped her eyes.  “I do Cheyenne, I want to see you.” Hank said standing in the door way.  Cheyenne looked at Hank.” Why so you may burn us at the stakes?” she asked him as her mind reeled with mixed emotions.  “I have regretted telling you that Cheyenne. I came here to tell you that I love you and want to raise the child as mine.” He told her coming to the bed.” I can’t live without you Cheyenne you’re my world without you in it, it does not revolve.” He told her sitting on the bed next to her kissing her hand.  Cheyenne began laughing. ”History is repeating it self father.” She told Frederick.  “Who are you talking to Cheyenne?” he asked as he could not see Frederick standing there as he was ghost.  “Show your self to him father.” She told Frederick.  When Hank saw Frederick standing there he was shocked.” He is your father?” he asked in disbelief.  “Oh there’s more I just found out, Aggatha is my grandmother, and Gore warrior is my child’s father and I am bound to him in a UN holy union. And our marriage is not recognized in the supernatural world.” She told him breaking down into tears.  He took her in his arms holding her.” you’re my wife no matter who recognizes it. You and I are bound in holy union and I am not leaving.” He told her as she cried in his arms.  “My child will not let me destroy his father. “ She told him crying in his arms as a child.  “Cheyenne you must pull your self together in order for this to work out or history will repeat itself completely.” Frederick told her.  “I know, I know and I will.” She told him rolling her eyes at him.  “Until we get things cleared up with Gore warrior Hank you should sleep in another room so we do not infuriate him any more since he has claimed Cheyenne as his.” Aggatha told him.  “I will do what ever it takes, just as long as Cheyenne loves me.” He told her.  “I love you Hank.” She told him. ”oh one more thing my real name is Mystic Shadow.” She told him.  “I will stick with the name Cheyenne.” he said as he kissed her.  “I will show you to your room.” Aggatha told him.  That night as Cheyenne slept soundly Gore warrior stood over her. He had silver dusk standing next to him, his female seductress that he used for his pleasures. “Make your self look like Cheyenne go to the mortal Hanks room and seduce him, then in time you will talk him into giving his soul to us.” He said smiling at her.  Silver dusk walked quietly to Hanks room where he slept in his bed, she slid into the bed next to him as she began to kiss him so lightly, and Hank woke up seeing Cheyenne next to him.” Cheyenne should you be in here?” he asked as she slid her hand into his pajama bottoms.” I need love Hank.” She told him as she felt him responding to her touch. She slid the night gown off of her then straddled him as she began to ride him slowly; he kissed her lips, as he caressed her breast. As she began to get him to get more into the seduction she cast a spell over him and turned back into her natural form of long black hair, blue eyes, her body was voluptuous and he was falling more into the spell deeper and deeper as his passion grew.” Give your soul to me to own Hank and you can have me forever.” She said rubbing her breast as he was being drained from her.  Before Hank could answer Fredrick appeared breaking her spell.  ” Hank come out of it or you will be doomed”. Fredrick’s voice boomed startling Hank.  “what the hell?” he asked knocking the woman to the ground where she vanished.” who was that?” Hank asked jumping out of bed.  “Gore warrior knows you’re here and that is his mistress she was going to have your soul if I hadn’t stopped you two.” Frederick told him.” Go to Cheyenne I am sure Gore warrior is there.”  Hank ran to the room where he found Gore warrior standing over Cheyenne.” get away from her!” he yelled  Cheyenne woke up seeing him by her bed using her powers sent Gore warrior out the window.  Hank explained to her about the woman and Frederick saving him in time. Cheyenne knew they would have to go where he and the others would be safe. She had Hank stay in her room that night to protect him from what ever else Gore warrior had planned for him.  Aggatha and Frederick convinced Cheyenne where ever she goes he’ll find her. They arranged for each one to take turns watching over the others while they slept when they were the most vulnerable.  “Six months later…”  “I am so huge!” Cheyenne said looking at herself in the mirror wearing a blue jean maternity dress. Her stomach was protruding, her hair turned back to dark brown.” I can not wait to have this child or the Good Year blimp is going to be jealous.” She joked with Tammy.  “Cheyenne what are we going to do when the time comes?” she asked fearful of the out come after the child’s birth.  “We are going to pray everything comes out ok for all of us.” She told her looking very serious when she noticed Gina listening at the door.” Gina what are you doing?” she asked the young girl.  “Nothing Cheyenne, I was just standing here! Everyone only cares about that stupid baby!” she said looking at her stomach with such an evil look.  “We care about you too Gina.” She told her walking up to her and pinching her cheek.  Not thinking.” I can’t wait until we are together with my daddy.” She said smiling up at Cheyenne.  “Your daddy?” Cheyenne asked the young girl wondering what she meant.  “Yes he is my daddy too not just the dumb baby’s.” She told Cheyenne hating the child she was carrying and then went flying into the wall so hard it knocked her unconscious.  “Who did that?” Tammy asked looking around.  “I think the baby did, I felt it kick when she went flying.” Cheyenne told her as she tried to help to revive the child.  That night as everyone slept Cheyenne snuck down to the kitchen where she found a package of raw liver. She was licking her lips as she removed it and placed it on a plate. As she sat down at the table she grabbed the meat with her hands as she began to devour it. Suddenly Aggatha knocked it out of her hand.” Stop it Cheyenne! You have to fight those cravings! The cravings are a demonic nature to eat raw bloody meat.” She told her holding her shoulders.  Cheyenne began to cry. ” Maybe I should just go to him and give in Aggatha.” She said as she looked at the raw meat and couldn’t believe she was eating it.” What have I done to all of us?” she cried feeling so lost and weak from her pregnancy.  Aggatha looked so sad remembering when her own daughter went through this.” The baby will come out like us my dear you will see.”  Aggatha told her with a smile hoping to convince Cheyenne that everything would work out, but she also tried to convince her self.  Cheyenne went back to her room she heard Gina talking to someone, she opened the door to find Gore warrior sitting on her bed.” get away from her!” she ordered him.” You were told not to come back here ever again!” she yelled as a hard wind began to blow in the room, Cheyenne feeling her anger rage and threw a lightening bolt at him.  Gore warrior moved out of its path before it could hit him.” Stop or I will kill your mortal husband who you have been keeping house with here!” he yelled.” My daughter keeps me well informed on you Mystic Shadow.” He told her calling her by her birth name from her parents.  “You little traitor!” Cheyenne snarled at the child who hid behind Gore warrior from Cheyenne’s Wrath that she had never seen before.  “You enjoy your time with the mortal one, but just remember the day the child is born you are coming with me where we are going to rule the Dark Side.” He told her as his eyes glowed.  Cheyenne stood there looking at him when Gina stepped out from behind him looking at him.” I am the Princess of Darkness I am the one who will rule the Dark Side not you and Cheyenne.” She told him.  He looked at the child angrily.” Now that the Prince of darkness is coming into the world you will be his servant and that’s all.” He told her pushing her to the ground.  Gina became outraged as she looked at Cheyenne’s stomach as she grabbed a pair of scissors running at Cheyenne to stab her in order to kill the baby when Gore warrior made the girl rise into the air then placing her in his hand by holding her up by the neck.” I will kill you; you little bitch if you even go near him or my queen ever again.” He growled as his face turned demonic.  “Stop it let her go! She is just a child!”   ” Cheyenne cried running to him to save Gina from him.  Gore warrior laughed awakening the whole house.” As you wish my queen.” He said dropping the child onto floor where she cried out from the pain.  “You bastard!” she yelled running to check on Gina.  Everyone was at the bedroom door the seven other women stood directly behind Cheyenne.  ” Leave here now.” She ordered him as her face almost looked like stone and hate raged from her eyes.  Gore warrior vanished as Cheyenne held the child crying into her arms. “Someone needs to stay in here at night with her.”  Gloria took the child from Cheyenne.” I will stay Cheyenne.” She told her holding Gina in her arms.  That night Cheyenne dreamt she was in a grave yard, the fog was thick making it hard for her to see where she was walking when she felt hands coming out of the graves grabbing at her feet and legs trying to drag her in to them. Cheyenne was screaming as she tried to get away from them when she ran into Gore warrior.” Why do you fight everything Cheyenne?” he asked as he walked towards her.  “Stay away from me.” She told him as she tried using her magic to make him disappear.  “It doesn’t work here in the dream world Cheyenne we are both with out the use of our magic here.” He said pulling her up to his strong masculine body as he touched her stomach with his hand.” You know I will not let you raise him without being by my side,” he told her looking into her eyes.  “I don’t love you Gore warrior why would I want to spend eternity with you?” She asked him, his face was only from hers.  “You would learn to love me as you love the son we made together.” He told her almost in a whisper close to her ear.” I brought you here to talk to you my love.” He said kissing her neck softly.  “No Gore warrior stop it!” she pleaded knowing she was helpless against him.  “Our son wants us together do you not care what he wants?” he asked her as he pressed his body up against hers rubbing his hands along her back. He could feel she was fighting the temptation of his touch.  “Stop Gore warrior you will hurt the child inside of me.” She pleaded wishing she could wake up.  He caressed her breast, his lips softly kissing her neck, to her breast, taking her to the ground with him; he had her on top of him as he made love to her. He broke through her resistance to him. Giving into the temptation and lust, he made her feel.  After they were finished he smiled up at her.” We will be so powerful together Mystic Shadow.  “No I will not go with you Gore warrior.” She told him firmly.  “Then you will live without our son Mystic Shadow.” He said pushing her down on the ground where the hands began to grab at her pulling her down into the graves as he laughed at her screams. Hank was shaking Cheyenne trying to get her to wake up as she was screaming in her sleep. “Baby wake up it’s a dream.” He was telling her as everyone ran into her room.  “He has her in the dream world where she is helpless I have to go save her.” Aggatha told them just as Tammy threw cold water from a pitcher on her forcing Cheyenne out of her sleep.  “I should have thought of that one.” Aggatha said.  Cheyenne shot up in the bed soaked from the pitcher of water gasping for air as she looked around the room as everyone watched fearing for her safety. ” He had me in the dream world where our powers were non existent, he tried to seduce me and succeeded, I was helpless to his advances, the temptation and lust!” she cried.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 07 by Erotica_Writings ©  Gore warrior gloated to him self that his plan was successful and Cheyenne was quiet during the ride home as she kept seeing Gore warrior's face over hers, but it was all a blur to her. Why would I think of him for? She thought to herself. It must have been because of my dream of Fredrick the other night, she thought to herself, Trying to explain it away but couldn't. Once they arrived home Cheyenne laid in bed all day feeling horrible from her night of drinking.  The next few weeks were hard on Cheyenne as she kept seeing Gore warrior's face and then she seemed to remember screaming out his name saying that she was his queen. I've finally gone crazy she thought to her self. She noticed her breasts were becoming very tender to the touch." What is going on with me?" She asked herself as she stood in front of the mirror. Cheyenne decided to just forget it what ever it was would go away. Cheyenne was wrong it did not go away but just got worse on her, certain smells began to make her nauseas. Maybe I got some weird flu she thought. She went to Aggatha and told her of her symptoms she was experiencing.  Aggatha looked at her smiling." My child it sounds like you're pregnant. I guess your night of drunkenness gave you more then a hang over." She teased Cheyenne.  Cheyenne looked at Aggatha." there is no way Hank is sterile and can't have children." She told her not knowing that Gore warrior was in the hall way listening.  So Hank can't have kids now how will you explain your pregnancy to him Cheyenne? He thought to himself. Then walking into the kitchen where the women were sitting. "You don't look good Cheyenne maybe we should go to the doctor's." he told her knowing what the out come would be.  "No I don't want to go Hank." She said hating doctors.  "Aggatha will you please take her to the doctors so we can find out what is wrong with her she has been this way for over three week's." he told Aggatha as he walked out of the house to go to the field where he let out a thunderous laugh  "Come on Cheyenne let's go and find out what's wrong." She told her.  Gore warrior was met by Dusk shroud." Well news has it Cheyenne is with child, your child." He said looking weary at Gore warrior.  "She has just gone to the doctor's I have a feeling Hank will be leaving since he can't have children." He said boisterous." You do have our un holy union recorded also?" he asked  "Yes it's all recorded, now let's go Gore warrior before we're discovered and destroyed." He said as they vanished.  Gore warrior smiled knowing he had just destroyed Cheyenne and Hanks marriage and he would be collecting what was his now when the time was right.  Aggatha and Cheyenne rode down the street Cheyenne noticed they were not going towards town." Where are we going?" she asked looking out the window.  "We have to go to one of our Doctors; you're a witch we can't very well go to a normal doctor." She explained to Cheyenne.  "Oh so we're going to a witch doctor then." She said sarcastically.  "Sit back and relax we will be there is just a few more minutes." She told her.  Cheyenne looked at the small house sitting alone in the woods." this is my doctor?" she asked looking strangely at the woman.  "Yes, now stop acting like a spoiled brat and come on." She told her.  "I am acting like a spoiled brat and you take me to the witch who wanted to eat Hansel and Gretel." She told the woman standing next to her shaking her head at Cheyenne for her acting childish.  As they waited for someone to greet them at the door Cheyenne looked around and saw a graveyard with a newly dug grave. On top of the grave were two cats fighting. " That's strange." She said as she watched the cats battling on top of the grave.  "The cats represent good and evil, they are battling over the soul of the recently deceased." She told Cheyenne.  "Makes sense to me." She said rolling her eyes as she turned towards the door again.  The door opened with a gray haired old woman standing there in a black dress." Cheyenne I have been waiting for you." The woman told her smiling.  Cheyenne just looked at the woman." How do you know me?" she asked.  "You're the High Priestess of the White Light; we all know who you are." She said kissing her hand.  When the woman was not looking Cheyenne wiped her hand off on her blue jeans." Please remove your clothes so I may examine you." She told Cheyenne smiling.  Cheyenne removed her black shirt and jeans, then slipped out of her sandals, she laid down on the table where the woman pointed. The woman checked her breast, then felt her stomach." ah yes there you are." She said smiling.  "There who is?" she asked looking around the room.  "Your baby" she said smiling as she ran her hands over her stomach with oils. "Give me your ring." She said.  Cheyenne took off her ring handing it to the woman who put it on a chain then watched the ring begin to move." A boy, our High Princess is having a little prince." She told them with a huge smile.  "You can't tell me I am pregnant this way! This is not how it is done!" Cheyenne rebelled.  "Very well then, I will show you your baby." The woman told her.  Waving her hand over her stomach she said a chant." Through the powers of our Higher Power show this doubting vision of her son she will feed from her breast." The woman chanted as she rubbed her stomach.  Cheyenne saw her baby in her stomach in a vision over her body the woman had cast. Tears came to her eyes as she saw her son in her womb.  "My son, that's my son! But how did I get pregnant?" she asked them smiling and looking confused at the same time.  "Why by your husband of course dear." The old woman said.  "No, it's impossible for it to be Hanks, he can't produce kids." Aggatha told her looking worried, as she knew this had to be the work of the Dark Side.  The three women looked at each other stunned." then who could it be if he is the only man you have slept with?" Aggatha asked Cheyenne.  "I don't know Aggatha! What does this mean?" Cheyenne asked.  "Well either you had an affair which we know is not true, or a warlock or demon has impregnated you," she told her.  "Wouldn't I know if I had sex with someone other then Hank?"  "Yes you would know if you were not knocked out." The old woman said.  "No I have never been knocked out! Even drunk I remember sleeping with my husband four weeks ago." She said looking so lost and confused.  'That is the time you got pregnant my girl," the doctor told her.  Cheyenne cried into her hands." he will not believe I have not slept around." Cheyenne looked up at them bewildered. "My marriage will be over and I have not done anything wrong."  Mean while Gore warrior being invisible had watched the whole thing even seeing his unborn son. Gore warrior had left Hank at the barn with implanting memories of the last few weeks of being with Cheyenne. when she confessed to him that she was a witch even giving him the necklace, Cheyenne going to the doctors, the night she got drunk, all except where Gore warrior mated with Cheyenne when the child was conceived while he waited in the closet frozen still. Gore warrior was proud that his plan had worked now soon she would be by his side dressed in black along with their son.  Aggatha drove Cheyenne home as Cheyenne kept touching her stomach knowing she had a life growing inside of her.  "Cheyenne this was meant to be! Or you wouldn't be pregnant!" She told her firmly.  They pulled into the house where Hank came to meet them at the car.  "What did the doctor say?" he asked wanting to know what was wrong with his wife.  "I am going to have a baby." She told him.  Hank stumbled backwards from the shock that Cheyenne was pregnant, knowing it was impossible that it was his child." Who have you been fucking to get you knocked up?" he yelled at her as jealousy and raged filled his entire soul.  "I have only slept with you Hank!" she yelled back "I have not been unfaithful to you," she told him as she grabbed his arm.  "Is Roger the father?" he yelled at her as he knocked her to the ground trying to make her let go of him.   Roger came out of the house after hearing all the yelling out side, he could not believe seeing Cheyenne laying on the ground as Hank stood over her. Hank looked insane with his face bright red, his veins popped out of his face and neck as he stood screaming at Cheyenne. Roger without a second thought was at Cheyenne's rescue. "Back off of her Hank!" he yelled just as Hank swung hitting Roger in the jaw.  Roger became infuriated and began beating Hank senseless. He realized this was making the matter worse especially for Cheyenne who was now screaming for them to stop. She sat on her knees on the ground with Aggatha standing by to make sure she was free of being harmed.  "She's all yours and that bastard child she is carrying in her stomach! Because it isn't mine!" he yelled storming off to his car leaving the house.  Roger looked at Cheyenne in disbelief." Your pregnant?" he asked her seeing how upset she was.  "Yes and Hank is sterile, I don't know how I got pregnant." She said crying.  Roger looked at her strangely. "Cheyenne come on, the immaculate conception only happened once before." He told her.  "Oh God, Roger please believe me I do not know how I got pregnant." She told him crying hysterically.  He took her in his arms." It's ok Cheyenne, he'll be back." He told her holding her and wishing he were the father of her child. He looked up at Aggatha for an answer.  "It could have been a warlock or demon, I don't know how with out her knowledge." Aggatha told Roger.  "Come on let's go inside." Roger told her." What do you mean a warlock or demon could have gotten her pregnant?" he asked looking strangely at Aggatha.  "Cheyenne is the High Priestess of the white light, but even she can still be vulnerable to them." She explained to him as they both helped Cheyenne into the house.  "How will I convince Hank?" she cried knowing he must hate her.  "You're a witch go to him, use your powers to find him." Aggatha told her.  Cheyenne stood in the middle of the room touching something that belonged to Hank. She saw him in a motel room crying into his hands." I will be back." She said as she vanished.  Cheyenne appeared in the motel room where Hank sat on the edge of the bed." Hear me out before you say a word." She told him quickly moving towards him and the bed.  Hank angrily got up off the bed and Cheyenne waved her hands so he could not move or speak just listen to what she had to say." Hank you forced me to use my powers, because I am innocent of being unfaithful to you. You have tried, convicted me just as they did back in the witch-hunts to those who were also innocent. I have not slept with anyone, a warlock or demon could have gotten me pregnant I am a witch and we are vulnerable to him or her. There is a reason I am pregnant, I saw my son and I am not going to loose him no matter how much I love you. He was given to me for a reason, but do not accuse me falsely of being unfaithful to you Hank." She told him as tears ran down her face. She then removed the spell that she placed on him.  "That was not fair forcing me to stand here and listen to you Cheyenne." He told her looking at her with so much contempt in his eyes. " you are having a child; you want me to believe that you do not know who the father is. Yet your ex boyfriend just happens to live with us, moves with us to another state and you turn up pregnant, but not by me! and now you want me to believe some warlock or demon just came along and fell inside of you then got you pregnant!" he yelled at her as the anger was eating him alive. "Well you know what if they did still burn witches I would make damn sure you and your kind were burned tonight!" He yelled at her filled with anger.  "You wish that upon me?" Cheyenne asked Hank not believing what he had said to her. "Fine Hank, I am going to grant you your wish and that is you will never see me again." She told him crying with a look on her face that told him he had just lost her then she vanished.  "Cheyenne." He said realizing he had gone to far with his words. "I will go talk to her tomorrow when I am calm and more rational.  When Cheyenne got back to the house she looked at everyone." we're leaving now," she said.  "Where Cheyenne?" Aggatha asked.  "Where we will be safe from Hank since he wishes we would be burned at the stake. I can't risk staying here and something happens to my family or unborn child..." She told her trying to hold back the tears and to cover up that her heart was shattering each time she thought of Hank.  "We'll go to your manor until its safe to come back." Aggatha told her.  "I have a manor?" she asked her looking surprised.  "Yes child, now get your things ready." Aggatha said.  Cheyenne with her magic packed everyone up to go. Roger and Saunders came down stairs from playing cards. He looked at her knowing that look on her face." Cheyenne, I am sorry. I never wanted to see that look of pain on your face ever again." He told her remembering that look the day she walked out of his life. He took her in his arms holding her as she broke down crying hysterically in his arms.  "Take us to the new place Aggatha." Saunders told her as he watched Roger and Cheyenne standing in the middle of the room wondering why things happened to them realizing he was looking at true love and they were oblivious to it.  In one movement of Aggatha's hand they were standing in an old house made of stone from centuries ago, it had been richly furnished from centuries ago with a winding staircase. The bedrooms had beds with canopies, dark red wood furniture, in Cheyenne's room she had a dressing table with a picture of her parents on it, Cheyenne looked at it sadly." My life is coming apart mama." She cried holding the picture to her heart crying. She changed into a long white gown with long wide spread sleeves the house felt cool to her. As she lay in her bed trying to piece everything together in her mind, only Hanks hateful words kept playing repeatedly in her mind. As she looked at the foot of her bed she saw Fredrick standing there." I am not a sleep so why may I ask are you here?" she asked him looking at him standing there in a dark suit.  "Well once I was a demon, but was killed by another demon. Now I am called a ghost." He told her sarcastically." You're a witch so act like one instead of a heart broken mortal." He told her angrily.  "You know Fredrick I liked you less as a demon and dislike you even more as a ghost. Why are you haunting me?" she asked him sitting up in her bed.  "Only you can help me get my revenge on Gore warrior." He told her." Look I will help you if you help get my revenge on him," he told her.  "Why should I help you?" She asked him angered by his request, " what makes you think you can help me? And when did you turn into a ghost by the way?" she asked him not believing she was actually talking to him.  "Last time I died." He answered her sarcastically." you got pregnant a month ago right? Was there anything strange about Hank?" he asked her sitting in mid air now with his legs crossed.  "Yes he constantly wanted sex," she told him remembering back.  "Do I have to draw you a picture, which is when your demon got into Hanks body Cheyenne." He told her looking down at her sitting up on her bed looking like a small child he remembered from long ago.  "But Hank remembered everything so wouldn't he had known if he was possessed?" she asked  "You're a witch wouldn't you know when your husband is possessed by a demon that your having sex with?" he retorted back at her.  "He did not act like he was any different except for the sex and I thought he was going through a mid life crisis so I dismissed it." She told him.  "Was there a time that you were out of your mind so to speak?" he asked.  "Yes, we got drunk, very drunk and he said I attacked him, that I was wild. You know who is responsible! Why can't you just tell me Fredrick?" she asked looking angrily at him.  "Yes I know who it is Cheyenne, but I can't tell you. You have to figure out for self who tricked you into a pregnancy." He told her." Did any certain person or thing keep popping up in your mind? He questioned her hoping to jar her memory.  "Oh my God! Gore warrior. " she said realizing what he did. "He is my baby's father." She said." I remember now but he was not in Hanks body I see him on top of me." She said as tears ran down her face.  "There's more too Cheyenne, you two were joined in a UN holy union that night the child was conceived." He told her." Remember Cheyenne it's the most important part."  Cheyenne held her face in her hands crying." he told me to call out his name, I did, he told me to tell him he was my master, I did, he told me to tell him I was his queen and oh my God I did!" she said getting off the bed." It was in a graveyard! What I have I done?" she asked Fredrick looking helpless and confused.  "I am afraid you are joined with Gore warrior and he can claim you at anytime." He told her." should I call you Mrs. Gore warrior?" he teased her.  "I am already married." She reminded him.  "To a mortal, you know that it is not recognized in our world." He told her.  "What do I do Fredrick? If you double cross me, I will make you worse then a ghost! Remember I am the High Priestess of the White Light and now it seems I will be the queen of the Dark side as well." She told him.  "He can come claim you at anytime Cheyenne." He told her." we must have a plan or you're going to lose the battle." As he floated in the air.  That night Cheyenne and Fredrick made their plan to destroy Gore warrior.  The next morning Hank went to the house to find everyone was gone the cars was there so he wondered how they had left. They had just vanished with out a trace or sign of them. Hank started searching in the house for anything that would lead him to Cheyenne. He started by going through the family's records and deeds unaware he was being watched by Gore warrior who would use him to lead him to Cheyenne. Hank found a deed to a house out in Maine; he would take the next flight out to see if they were there. He did not want to live his life without Cheyenne even with the baby that she was carrying he would raise it as his. He made his reservations for the air port.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 06 by Erotica_Writings ©  That night as Cheyenne slept, she dreamt of her parents and the night they left her at the orphanage, she then saw as they and the eight other parents were attacked by Fredrick and his evil servants. She watched how they blew their parents up because they would not join him. Then she found herself face to face with him in her dream.  “Why do you bother me Fredrick? You were destroyed by your own right hand man.” She told him.  “Revenge. That is what I am seeking on Gore warrior or Otis as you know him by.” Fredrick told her.  “Why when we have destroyed them? What more of revenge could you want?” she asked him getting even closer to him.  “He will return to collect his child, they try to convince me it was my blood and sperm that created her when in fact it was his,” he told her.  “We destroyed him he is not coming back and the child never nursed off of the bitch’s breast.” She told him.  “Are you one hundred percent sure Cheyenne? Can you be sure he was destroyed and she did not suckle from those breasts when your body was inhabited by the so called queen of darkness?” he asked as their bodies were almost touching, she could almost feel his breath on her face.  “Yes .you are trying to throw me off track; I plan on winning this battle for my own revenge of my parent’s death.” She told him, as they stood so close as if they had known each other before being kidnapped by him.  He touched her hair with his fingers.” You’re as beautiful as your mother, but she did not want to be my queen, you have her same traits.” He said smiling.” The love for your father was her death.”  Cheyenne awakened finding she was still in her bed with Hank lying next to her sleeping.” How do I tell you I am a witch?” she whispered to herself. Cheyenne slipped out of bed and went to check on the child sleeping down the hall.  Opening the door slowly she looked inside where she saw the child sleeping soundly. I am sure she never sucked the breast milk. Cheyenne thought to herself when a hand gripped her shoulder tightly. Cheyenne jumped as she turned to see who it was standing there. ”Damn it Hank start making some noise will you!” she said irritated.  “I am sorry that I scared you.” He said holding her in his arms.  “I am sorry for snapping at you I have a lot on my mind.” She said hugging him. “Let’s go back to bed.” She told him smiling up at him.  The next morning Hank was out in the fields plowing unaware that he was being watched by Gore warrior and his companion Rip snake standing in the woods. “Gore warrior why are we here? “ He asked knowing that if caught by the witches they would be destroyed by them.  “It is time for my child to be conceived.” He said watching Hank on the machinery.  “The girl is here being raised by the witches have you forgotten?” he questioned Gore warrior.  “My son must be conceived by the high witch Cheyenne.” He told him smirking at the thought.  “By the witch who is going to destroy all of us? Are you mad?” he asked looking at him like he lost his mind.  “No its how we win the battle, could she kill her own son? When she could not kill the traitor Aggatha’s son? “He asked smiling. “Then I plan on taking my place at the throne with her as my Queen.” He told Rip snake.  “The girl is supposed to rule the kingdom of darkness.” Rip snake told him.  “Her mother was human so that makes her only half demon.” He explained to him.” I have other plans for her.” He said laughing.  Now I must go and take over his body do not come back around here until I summon for you.” He told Rip snake.  The unsuspecting Hank had stopped for a drink of water when Gore warrior with one leap jumped into Hanks body. Hank was in pain as Gore warrior inhabited his body then his head dropped from passing out. Hank raised his head up smiling with green glowing eyes.” Now it is time to visit with my ever so lovely wife.” He said to himself as he let out a thunderous laugh.  Gore warrior went back to the house to find Cheyenne in the shower as he picked up her gown smelling the sent of her on it.” How I have missed your gorgeous body.” He said removing his clothes to join her in the shower.  Cheyenne jumped when the shower door opened.” Hank you startled me.” She said smiling at him.  “I thought it would be nice to join you in the shower,” he said smiling taking the wash cloth as he washed her breast he kissed her.  “Mmmm Hank I thank you are being a naughty boy.” She said as she began to wash his body slowly.  “I want you Cheyenne.” He said pushing her up against the shower wall, kissing her softly; he fondled her breast he picked her up so she could wrap her legs around him.  He entered her body as she let out a moan, he began to ram his stiffness deep inside her, and they made love so wildly in the shower as they came together in an explosion so powerful it weakened Cheyenne. “Oh Hank our love making just keeps getting better and hotter.” She told him as she leaned against him.  Gore warrior hid his face into her shoulder so she could not see his glowing eyes.  He picked her up carrying her to the bed where he began to kiss and lick her body.” There is more to come Cheyenne.” He said as he mounted her body.” I can’t get enough of you.” He told her as he moved his body in a slow grinding circular motion.” I feel your heat growing with in you Cheyenne.” He said grinding harder.  “Oh Hank, Hank, Hank!” she said as she was ready to climax.  “Cheyenne we will be together forever!” he said as he rammed her harder until their fluids flowed together as he hid his eyes from her by turning his face away as he closed his eyes. Thinking of how he had tricked this witch in believing he was her husband.  Cheyenne kissed his lips.” I need to go finish my shower then I am going to town for a few things.” She told him.  “Go on I will just lay here for a bit thinking of our future ahead of us.” He said smiling for he was with the woman he wanted from the first day, he saw her in the office. As Cheyenne was showering, he watched the child outside playing   .” my daughter soon we will all be together.” He said aloud to himself.  He decided to go to the barn to look around this place trying to find the witches room. Once inside of the barn he was visited by Dusk shroud the eldest of the dark side, he was dressed in a long black hooded robe with a long white beard.” Have you gone mad?” he questioned Gore warrior.  “No I want the mother of my son to be powerful and we all know Cheyenne is the High Priestess of the white light.” He told him.  “You fool! She is not going to join us! She is for the good and innocent to protect them from us!” He told him.” when she finds out how you tricked her she will destroy you and that means we all will fall with you because of your being over sexed! “He told him.  “She will not kill our son and he will be powerful with both of our powers.” He told him.  “What of your daughter she is meant to kill Gina it is written.” he told Gore warrior.  “She will just be a small sacrifice for the prince of darkness to be born.” He told the old man getting tired of the conversation.  “Gore warrior have you forgotten she destroyed the queen of darkness in battle before she had all her powers? With out the girl where will we get another one to replace her?” he asked.  “Cheyenne is going to rule the Dark Side by my side or she will die,” he told him with glowing eyes as he gritted his teeth.  “When she finds out you killed her husband she will destroy you fool. “The old man told him.  “He is not dead just on vacation lets say, until I am done with his body. When I am sure she has conceived my son then I will leave and he can come back with out any knowledge of what has happened.” He said laughing.” he will think he was man enough to impregnate Cheyenne.” He told him.   “So how then do you plan on taking Cheyenne and the boy?” He asked Gore warrior.  When my son has his powers I will come back collect my son and queen.” He told him.” Now leave here before you ruin everything.” He told Dusk shroud.  Later that evening Gore warrior watched Gina torturing a small kitten outside. He walked up to the child kneeling down in front of her.” I will kill you if you do not start acting as you are supposed to act.” He said with green glowing eyes.  Gina was startled.” Father? You’ve come for me?” she asked smiling thinking he was here for her.  “ no it is not time for you, but if you kill one more person giving away who you really are I myself will rip you apart you little bitch!” he told her sounding demonic making her release the kitten she had been stabbing with a needle.  “Yes father I under stand.” She told him looking scared.  “Now go play like normal children!” he ordered her.  Gore warrior went back inside of the house to his bedroom looking in the mirror he could see his true reflection.” Soon, very soon my son will be conceived.” He said looking in the mirror when he heard Cheyenne coming into the room. “So what did you do in town?” he asked her as he looked at her body so toned, built as he had seen no other woman so perfect and she was his forever.  “I bought you a gift.” She said handing him a small box.  “What is it?” he asked smiling at her.  “Open it silly if you want to know.” She said teasing him.  He opened the box up seeing a chain with a gold eagle. "Oh Cheyenne it is great thank you.” He told her kissing her.” What is the occasion?”  “Nothing just that I feel I have been neglecting you and I need to tell you something Hank.” She said feeling uneasy.  “I am not a guardian angel, but a witch.” She told him.  He looked at her confused. He does not know she is witch! He thought to himself.” A witch with a broom stick and all?” he asked trying to act as Hank would.  “Yes baby the whole thing.” She told him.  “I see.” He said looking at her.” I don’t know Cheyenne if this will work,” he told her looking angry.  “But it would work if I was the guardian angel?” she asked  “Well there’s only one way you can prove to me it will work.” He said  “What can I do to prove to you it will?” she asked.  “Straddle my lap.” He said.  When Cheyenne did as he asked he slipped his hands under her shirt on her breast.” It’s starting to convince me a little bit more.” He told her smiling.  “Well let me convince you more.” She said removing her top she pushed him back on the bed where they began to make love again for hours.  Cheyenne was exhausted by the time they had stopped making love and slept in his arms thinking she was safe and sound in the arms of the man she loved .As Gore warrior held her smiling knowing soon she would become pregnant with his son.  The next morning when they awoken Gore warrior was fondling her. Cheyenne sat up in bed looking down at him.” Are you going through a mid life crisis or something?” she asked him wondering why he wanted so much sex.  “I don’t know maybe I am I am sorry if it bothers you.” He said acting mad.  “Cheyenne felt bad for upsetting him.” I am sorry that I made you mad it’s just not like you to want so much sex.” she tried to explain to him.  “Maybe I was just trying to add some spice to our marriage. I am sorry if it bothered you. “He said getting out of bed looking out of the window.  Cheyenne came up behind him after stepping out of her gown and pressing herself up against his body. “Take me please.” she whispered in his ear.  Gore warrior turned around taking her in his arms as they fell to the floor where he ravished her body roughly.” Tell me you’re mine, all mine!” he whispered in her ear kissing her all over her neck and ears.  “I am yours, I am all yours!” she told him as they exploded together in an orgasm so powerful she laid there as he laid on top of her both of them breathing heavy.  The rest of the day he spent in the field acting as Hank plowing the field when Rip snake appeared.” Well now if this is not a picture the great Gore warrior doing mortal work.” He said as he taunted Gore warrior.  “What do you want?” he asked finding his humor boring.  “When you get tired of the witch let me have a crack at her. “He said as he was taunting Gore warrior. ”I watched her giving it to you this morning and that witch is what I want to ride me log and hard.”  Gore warrior became in raged with anger sending his counter part flying through the air he raised his hand up in the air as Rip snake was dangling in air he made his other hand look as if it was strangling him.” You ever speak of her like that I will kill you.” He said in an evil calm voice dropping him to the ground.  “Gore warrior you don’t just want a son with her! You fell in love with her when she destroyed the queen of darkness! Didn’t you?!” he demanded of Gore warrior who could destroy him in an instant he was so powerful.  “She is going to my queen and you will show her respect!” he ordered him.” I fell in love with her when I first laid eyes on her.” He said looking almost kind.  “Demons, warlocks of our kind don’t fall in love Gore warrior! You are going to bring us all down because of one witch!” he yelled at him.  “Leave now or I will kill you I swear!” he told the man as his eyes glowed green his voice sounding demonic.  Rip snake vanished before Gore warrior could kill him.  “I am in love with her, as soon as I know she has conceived my son I will leave only to come back at its birth.” He told himself, or was it he was trying to convince himself that he could just walk away from her. “No!” he yelled as he was fighting his heart from becoming soft.  Cheyenne met the other women to work out she was tired. The other women noticed how bad she looked.  “Cheyenne what is happening to you?”  “Hank is happening to me, it’s like he can’t get enough sex lately.” She told them.  “Your complaining I have tried seducing Saunders no luck, and forget Roger I think he has gone celibate.” Gloria told her.  “I got Saunders last week.” Lindsey told them.  “Anyone get Roger?”Gloria asked.  They all answered no.” but I saw him with a girl two weeks ago who looked just like Cheyenne.” Alicia told them.  “Let’s stop gossiping and start working out.” Cheyenne told them feeling even more agitated because of her deep feelings for Roger.  The women worked out for hours unaware that Hank left with out telling anyone. As Gore warrior drove down the street when he spotted a woman walking down the road he stopped next to her.” need a ride?” he asked her smiling.  “Why yes thank you,” she told him getting in the car.” I am just going into town.” She told him.  “That’s nice.” he said not paying attention to her as he turned the car into the woods.  “Hey what are you doing?” she asked trying to open the car but he had locked them with his magic.  He came to an area where he stopped and slapped the woman.  ” Don’t you know you shouldn’t ride with strangers?” he asked in a deep demonic voice.  The woman was too scared to even scream. Gore warrior got out of the car stepping out of Hanks body and freezing him in place. He then dragged the woman out of the car; he raped her savagely as he kept repeating he did love her! He bit into the woman’s throat with green glazing eyes. He feasted upon her body until he was full and his anger had calmed down.  Gore warrior stepped back into Hanks body then drove back to the house where he saw Cheyenne sitting on the bench swing. As he got out of the car she smiled at him as she was happy to see him. I am in love with her, just as they think I am. He thought to himself as he walked up to where she was sitting. “Did you enjoy your work out?” he asked her giving her a kiss on her lips.   “Yes I did.” She told him.  “Let’s go out tonight Cheyenne.” He said needing to be away from the house and having her alone to himself.  “That sounds good to me Hank.” I will go shower and get ready.” She told him as she hurried upstairs.  As Cheyenne showered she was happy to be going out. she picked out a red dress that was sleeveless , cut low exposing most of her bust, the back was cut down to the top of her buttocks, the sides were cut out in round circles showing her flesh. She put on make up out lining her red lips in a deeper red. She wore her hair up on top of her head with tiny diamond earrings. She picked out a three piece black suit for Hank to wear out. That night they went to dinner where Gore warrior plied her with Champagne. Cheyenne was getting very drunk as he kept insisting on her to drink. When they were leaving the restaurant he had to carry her to the car. A drunken witch he thought to himself. He looked at her body as he placed her in the car.” we’re going to have fun tonight Cheyenne.” He told her.  Cheyenne looked at him with one eye opened as she slurred her words.” Ok letsh have fun.” She said waving her hands about.  Gore warrior turned into a graveyard instead of taking her home. Once inside of the mausoleum he ripped her clothes off her. Seeing she was so drunk, he stepped out of Hanks body sticking him up against the wall frozen still. As he turned back to the drunken naked Cheyenne grabbing her by the head of hair he had her perform oral sex on him. ”Ah Cheyenne.” He said laying her on a tomb on her back and then he entered her.” Look at me Cheyenne.” He ordered her as he rammed her body with his.” Look at me and know I am your master and you’re my queen!” he said as his eyes glowed green.  “you’re my master and I am your queen?” she slurred looking at his face.” what pretty eyes you have.” She said touching his face as he kissed her fingers.  “Cheyenne cry out my name Gore warrior!” he said sucking her breast.  “Gore warrior!” she said as he ravished her body.  “Tell me you’re my queen.” he ordered her.  Cheyenne aroused by Gore warrior. Remembering the passion they shared between them when she had been abducted.” I am your queen Gore warrior.” She said as she began to become more alive. “I want you Gore warrior, I belong to you forever.” She told him as she began to straddle him taking him deep with in her.  “Do you want to conceive my son Cheyenne?” he asked her as he kissed her breast and lips.  “Yes, I want our son.” She told him as they climaxed together. Gore warrior was his demonic self when he planted his seed deep with in her.  When he finished with her, he stepped back into Hanks body as Cheyenne vomited into the ground. As she was falling to sleep he whispered in her ear.” Anything you recall tomorrow was just a dream.” He said as she slept next to him. “Tonight you sealed our union with your own words out of your mouth.” He said as he watched her sleep for tonight their union was sealed in a UN holy union.  That morning Cheyenne woke up not knowing where she was, ”oh my head it hurts so much.” She said holding her head.  Gore warrior touched her shoulder.” Guess you have a bad hang over this morning.’ He told her.” you were wild last night.” He told her.  Cheyenne was squinting her eyes as she tried looking around the room.” Where are we?” she asked laying her head back on the pillow.  “You had me stop at a motel where you ripped your clothes off and attacked me.” He told her seeing if she recalled anything.  “I attacked you?” she asked him.  “Yes you raped me to be exact.” He said smiling knowing the truth” you actually made me to let you give me oral sex that is how drunk you were.” he told her feeding her more of the lie to her.  “I am sorry if I was out of control last night.” She told him feeling really bothered by what she had heard about how she acted in the room.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 05 by Erotica_Writings ©  On the table were breads, fruits, in the middle of the table laid Fredrick's wife, her throat had been slit and her body was slit down the middle." Eat my queen I have waited so long for you." He told her.  Cheyenne walked to the dead woman where she reached in and grabbed her heart as she began to devour it, blood ran down her face." Perfect you remembered how I liked it after three hundred years." She laughed wickedly eating the heart.   Soon the others began to feast on the dead woman's body as they rejoiced the return of their queen. Otis stood next to her and ran his hand down her back softly. She looked into his eyes with the knowledge of a secret they both shared. Fredrick would be leaving again to prepare a new place where they would continue their plan to capture the world.  "Gore warrior you are to protect my queen as long as I am gone and to see she wants for nothing." He said to Otis as he kissed her on the lips. "I will return in three days my queen." He told her as he was leaving.  "I am sure I will be in good hands." She said as she looked deep into his eyes. "Meet me in my room." She whispered to him.  Once in her room she waited for Otis to join her, she slipped out of her clothes and laid on the bed nude until he came to her. He walked into the room and smiled.  " I have waited three hundred years to be reunited with you." He said removing his clothes.  "Have you arranged for his demise so we may rule our kingdom together?" she asked watching him remove his clothes.  "Yes my Queen. "He told her joining her in bed.  "Feed me my love as I have a burning with in for you to put out." She told him as he raised his body over hers.  "I will pleasure you my queen." He said as he roughly took her in a heat of passion.  "Kill him tonight! I order you as your queen to do this task I have given you." She whispered in his ear as he ravished her body sending her into a frenzy of orgasms.  His face began to turn into a grotesque monster as Cheyenne's eyes began to glow green. "Where is my child?" she asked Otis after their mating.  He rose from the bed and began to dress, he looked at her and smile.  " The Princess of darkness has not been born yet, but soon very soon you will have her in your arms." He told her.  "Why is the woman who has her in her body not here so my child can be getting the foods it need?" she questioned him.  "Fredrick wanted to wait until we got the woman that you are the hostess of her body." He told her as he was getting ready to leave.  "Go now and I will decide how long this woman will wait before I have her here." She told him.  The Queen of darkness put black tight pants that exposed her ass cheeks, with a halter top and black boots." I think I will go adventuring out today." She said looking in the mirror at her self. Then she disappeared into green smoke.  She appeared in front of Cheyenne's and Hanks house where she saw Kimberly eating ice cream on the porch as she stood behind the trees. I will take pleasure cutting my child out of your nasty fat body. She thought to herself when a hand touched her shoulder. As she turned it was Saunders standing in front of her. She smiled looking into his eyes as her eyes glowed green preventing him from moving. She ran her hands over his chest." I am hungry "she said licking his neck with her tongue. She wrapped her arms around him, she was ready to feed on his neck, but a bitter sweet memory of him and her playing football with other police officers flashed through her mind making her turn away and vanished before she could kill him. Back in her room she looked in the mirror. " So Cheyenne you are a strong willed woman, but I will over power you and destroy you forever!" she said throwing herself on the bed frustrated that Cheyenne was able to stop her from completing her feeding on the man.   Cheyenne smiled at her floating above the bed. "Then be prepared to battle to the death, I will not give up so easily." She said with her arms folded looking at the Queen of Darkness pouting on the bed.  The queen of darkness smashed the mirror on the dresser with a lamp, "Bitch!" She snarled and walked out to where the others were, singling out one of her own men." Come to my room now." she told him looking around to make sure no one noticed her and her own warrior going to her room.  In her room the man stood before her as she wrapped her arms around him." Pleasure me the Queen of darkness now. "She said as she was tricking him into bed with her.  Feeling frustrated and defeated out one killing by Cheyenne the Queen of the Dark side straddled her warrior as he caressed her large breast, she moved her hips slowly on him, she lowered her face to his kissing him, licking him, and once she was at his neck she reached her orgasm and then biting into his neck she began sucking the life out of him, she then continued to eat into his throat satisfying her hunger. When she had finished she looked at his body with out life." Mmmm finger licking good." She laughed wickedly as the man's body disappeared with one swipe of her hand and her eyes glowed a bright green.  Saunders stood looking around wondering what had just happened. Where had the woman disappeared to, she had been at this very spot. Dumb founded he went back to the house where Roger and Hank were reading up on the super natural.  " Something weird just happened to me, a woman half dressed was watching the house and when I grabbed her she disappeared. The strange thing was I almost felt Cheyenne was there." he told the men feeling a chill run through his body.  "Hank looked at him." What did she look like?" he asked trying to under stand what was happening and where was his wife.  Like Cheyenne only with long black hair, her eyes glowed green then everything seemed to stop and she was gone." he told him looking more confused then before.  Roger put his head down. "God please help us before it is too late." He said feeling totally lost as well as Cheyenne being lost to him forever.  Suddenly the whole house began to shake around them." What is happening?" Norma asked jumping up from the couch.  Kimberly began to violently vomit green slime, her body began to twirl in a circle she disappeared into thin air before their very eyes.  Norma screamed as her body was too paralyzed to move." Oh my Sweet Jesus saves us!" she screamed out.  The rumbling finally subsided; they all looked at each other not believing what had just taken place. Saunders went to the place Kimberly had been sitting." She has been taken as well." He said looking at the others.  Norma was screaming hysterically." They are going to get all of us one at a time!" she said falling to her knees.  Roger went to her and he picked her up off the ground." Pull your self together! We have to get out of here." he told them.  Hank looked at him." Where the fuck are we going to go?" he yelled not knowing how to feel or act.  There was a loud banging at the door; they all looked at it not knowing who could be on the other side. Hank walked slowly to the door as he opened it slowly he saw Aggatha standing at the door.  Hank swung the door open causing the woman to be startled." What the fuck do you want?" Hank bellowed at the elderly woman.  "Please if you want your wife and friend back you need me." She said holding up her hand that displayed a cross in her palm almost as if it had been branded there.  Roger came up behind Hank." Let's hear what she has to say since we have no other avenues at this time." He told Hank grabbing him by the shoulder." Come in Aggatha." He said pulling Hank away from the door.  The woman walked through the house looking around." I feel much love here; I feel your wife's soul has escaped here for safety since the demonic has no love, only lust." She told them.  Hank's face turned white." she's dead?" he said softly.  "No she has just escaped here so her soul would not have to dwell with evil every second." She explained to them." today when her friend there Detective Saunders was about to be attacked and killed she jumped back inside of the Queen of darkness evidently she won seeing he is still alive." She said looking at Saunders.  "You work for them why should we believe you?" Hank asked.  " No I work for the power of the white light as some of you know it as God and it was Roger's and Norma's cry out to him for help that he sent me to you" she explained as she looked at Norma." There is only one way to convince you, I will allow you to see Cheyenne." She said turning off the lights.  Suddenly a bright white light lit up the whole room Cheyenne appeared dressed in a long white gown, bare foot, her long blond hair flowing, she smiled down at them. "Aggatha is good, but she is right they have to be stopped soon or I will not be able to get back into my body and they will have won. You must save Kimberly's unborn child, they want to turn it evil to destroy everything good on earth." she smiled looking so angelic." I love you all and its that, that gives me the power I need to fight back." she said as she faded away.  Hank looked at where Cheyenne had been.  " Cheyenne don't go!" he cried out to her as she faded away into thin air." How do we defeat them to get her back?" he asked Aggatha.  "You must have them all in one area of a room where they cannot escape us, if one slips through it will not stop." She told them.  "What about the baby?" Roger asked.   "If we obtain the child soon after birth we can save her from evil." She said as she stood with her hands folded around a rosary." We need to get started to find where they are." She said going to the kitchen table.  "What you don't know where their at?" Saunders asked.  "If I did I could have destroyed them long ago, so now we must do it together," she told them folding out a map.  "What are all these marks on the map?" Roger asked her.  "These are abandoned old mansions, the ones marked have been checked, and we don't have time to waste, we must find the right one." She said.  A white feather floated down onto the map, they all looked at each other." Cheyenne must have sent this, she is growing weak. Does anyone know of this place?" Aggatha asked.  "It's the Feinstein's old mansion in the middle of the woods, legend has it that the husband killed his family and disappeared from sight never to be found." Roger told them.  "Roger his first name was Fredrick, he was having an affair with a woman practicing witch craft. His wife's heart and all of her organs had been eaten from what rumors have it." Saunders said.  "Why didn't we notice him from the pictures we got of Harrelson?" Hank asked.  "He would be two hundred years old Mr. Thompson." Aggatha told him.  "He holds his age well. " Hank replied.  "I must remind you that if the body it's self is shot or anything of that nature the human sharing the body will parish also." She told them.  "So how do we kill them with out killing the victims?" Saunders asked.  "With this vial of potion I have here." She told him holding a gold and black vial in her hand.  "This is in the movies for Christ sake." Roger told her.  "No only wooden stakes and silver bullets are. If this potion is placed on the weapon it will kill the demonic beings as well as the human." She told them.  "So how do we get this stuff on them? Walk up to them telling them to hold out their arm?" Hank asked Aggatha.  "When attacking you must splash it on them anywhere you can make contact." She told them.  "So when do we go?" Hank asked her.  "Tomorrow after we have pulled the land records, we need the lay out of the house so we are not wasting time searching every inch." She told them.  " We should all sleep in this room together so we make it through the night with each one of you wearing these amulets to help protect you." She said handing out the amulets.  They slept on the floor on pellets as the elderly lady sat up watching over them as she said prayers that sounded to the others as chants. She never slept as she was protecting her innocents from evil attacking them as they slept. Cheyenne's spirit could be felt in the house for Ralph and Ninja lay by the rustic table near the chair she always sat in when she was home.  The Queen of darkness was becoming restless when Otis came back." I need to be fed now." She hissed at him.  "Well my Queen here is the heart of Fredrick you can start with then I will take you to find new meat." He told her smiling.  "You accomplished his demise! Come and share his heart with me so we both acquire his powers." She told him as she held the still beating heart in her hand smiling at it so wickedly.  As the two demons devoured the Prince of darkness heart the wind began to blow harder , lightening was crackling all over the room, they both began to glow a brighter green they began to scream a horrendous scream as their bodies began to turn into demonic creatures more grotesque then they were before.  The Queen of darkness feeling the new powers serge through her looked at Otis." I wish to go test them now." She told him. "As soon as my child is born she will be the Princess of Darkness." She said laughing.  "Lets go, I know of a bar in town that even the law officials want to be rid of." He told her as they left  ." I guess we will be helping them." She told him as they left to go to feed.  As they arrived at the small biker bar the queen of darkness and now the new prince of darkness changed their attire to fit into the biker crowd ." how do I look?" she Asked Otis.  He looked at her in black shorts cut above her ass cheeks, thigh high boots, a top made out of only strings with just enough material covering her large hardened nipples, her long black hair hanging loosely."  "You look great." He told her as he stood before her in a black Harley shirt, black vest with a patch that said " DEMONS", blue jeans with boots, a wallet hanging from a chain off of his belt.  "Lets go I want to feed." She told him.  Once inside she spotted two women sitting at the bar these were to be hers. She sat next to the one with large breast, her hair was long and red, her jeans fit her body tightly, and she wore silver jewelry." Hi" the woman said as she sat next to her.  "Hi I am Cheyenne." She told them looking at the woman's large breast.  "Like what you see?" she asked  "I like what I see very much." She told her smiling as she touched the woman on her shoulder letting fingers slide down to her cleavage.  The woman's friend leaned over to introduce herself to Cheyenne." Hi baby I am horny and I just love what I see of that package of yours." The woman told the princess of darkness.  "Really, well let me get a better view of you." She said as she walked over to her bar stool. As she looked over the slim blond wearing a red dress with strings on the sides holding the dress together, she touched her small breast softly then leaned over softly kissing her neck. The woman responding to her advances opened her legs so the queen of darkness could touch her bare crotch.  " Mmmm horny I think you will enjoy my eating you." The queen of darkness smiled as she moved her hand under the woman's dress feeling the woman's moistness as her hips began to move to her touch.  The others in the bar were yelling for a three some between the three women as the one with the large breast removed her top as the princess of darkness began to lick her hardened nipples. Everyone was encouraging them to continue with the sex acts. The Queen of darkness looked at the large breasted woman who removed the Queen of darkness clothes for her. The woman grabbed her as she felt of her breast, kissing her softly. The Queen of darkness then dropped to her knees where she began to give the smaller woman oral sex as the men and women were going wild. With out the others realizing it Otis had locked any way out of the bar.  Otis had a woman on the pool table performing anal sex on her. A large male biker grabbed the Queen of darkness kissing her as he caressed her large breast." You bitches are driving me crazy." he said as he roughly threw the Queen of darkness on the bar, he entered her body as she moaned from the pleasure. The women and the men began to have sex with each other like they were under a spell of some kind. The man who was with the Queen of darkness was just getting ready to explode in side of her when her eyes began to glow as she bit out a piece of his throat then spitting it on the smaller woman who was oblivious to what was taking place around her. Otis had turned into his demonic self and ripped the woman's heart out of her chest, He began to eat it as he exploded his juices with in her. The others in the bar were oblivious to what was happening to their friends. The Queen of darkness grabbed the large breasted woman "pleasure me now!" she ordered her. As the princess of darkness lay on the bar having sex with the woman while the smaller woman was kissing and caressing her breast. She grabbed the smaller woman ripping her heart from her chest continuing her sexual frenzy with her friend as she ate the other woman's heart. After the hour of sex and feeding frenzy everyone in the bar was dead. She approached Otis. "Pleasure me my prince." She said laying on the pool table where they began to have sex amongst the blood and gore. He entered her giving her the orgasm she wanted now that she had been fed to satisfy her hunger.  The next day Hank was able to get the lay out of the house so they could study it." When are we going?" he asked Aggatha.  "Tonight we must attack at midnight." She instructed them.  The day seemed to go by so slowly for them. Norma turned on the television set to the news where they saw the Prince and Queen of darkness had attacked the bar the night before.  The news reporter a young Latin male was recanting what the owner of the bar found when he opened the doors for the cleaning crew. "Last night at a local tavern frequented by local bikers the authorities were alerted to a bloody massacre by the owner of the establishment and the cleaning crew that happened upon the grizzly scene of the blood and mutilations of the patrons along with the bar matron. One witness was heard saying that the body organs were gone from the victims as if they were had been ripped out of their bodies. At this time there aren't any suspects to this bloody massacre. Stay tuned for further information."  Roger and Saunders looked at each other." We have to stop this before they kill everyone." Roger said unsure tonight would even work that they may end up amongst the victims.  "Oh my God how are we going to carry this out?" Norma asked.  "With the help of the almighty, that is how." Aggatha told her.  Hank sat in his bedroom listening to Cheyenne's favorite song, He stopped loving her today. He sat hunched over holding her picture in his hands the tears fell like tender rain drops onto the picture. Roger came into the room, he knew the big mans heart was being torn apart. He sat next to him on the bed putting his arm around his shoulder." I am not going to tell you we will get her back alive Hank, because I just do not know, in fact, I do not know if any of us will make it out alive. What I do know is that you have to use the love you two have for each other to help fight this thing." He told him as he tried to comfort him and be honest at the same time with him.  Hank took a deep breath looking at Roger." I guess you better use that love that fills your heart for her too it will have twice the fighting chance." He said handing him her picture.  Roger smiled fighting back tears." Well then with the two of us fighting for her she's got one hell of a fighting chance." He told Hank trying to force a laugh as he looked at her picture wishing she was here and safe.  Saunders had seen what had just happened between the two men, she is some kind of a woman that is for sure. He thought to himself as the men entered the room.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 05 by Erotica_Writings ©  Kimberly was tied to a bed in a room where the queen of darkness came to her with a plate of spleen, hearts and intestines." I have brought food for my child to feed on." she told her.  "Your child? No, it is my child." Kimberly told her.  "You fat ugly bitch that child you carry was fathered by Fredrick to be the ruler of the dark side." She yelled at Kimberly as she grabbed her face digging her nails into her flesh.  "You've made a mistake; the father is James Weston from Tennessee." She told her crying.  "No you ignorant sow; it was Fredrick using another human form to impregnate you." She told her. "I will take great pleasure in killing you myself tonight after my child is born. Now eat!"  Kimberly looked at the human organs on the plate and began to gag.  " I can't eat that!" She cried pushing the plate away from her.  "Yes you can and will!' she yelled shoving the heart into her mouth.  " Now eat it or I will kill you now!" she ordered.  Kimberly tried to eat it, she gagged with each bite feeling as if she would vomit at any second as the woman kept shoving it in her mouth.  "You will eat every bite of this food, and then we must prepare you for its birth" she told her shoving the intestines in her mouth." Eat it!" She yelled grabbing her by the face digging her long sharp black nails into the sides of her cheeks again. The woman grabbed a glass of blood after she ate everything on the plate." Drink this; it is the blood of her father... Fredrick." She told her pouring the glass of blood down her throat. The Queen of darkness ordered her people to take her to cleanse her body so the birth may begin.  Kimberly began to cry." It's not time! I am only six months pregnant, you will kill the baby if you take it too early!" she pleaded trying to spare her life as well as her child's.  "Shut up you fat ugly cow!" the woman screamed at her. "Now take this repugnant creature so my child may be born."  They took Kimberly to a room full of lit candles, she was placed on a table screaming, and under it was a large circle with a star in the middle. Kimberly was crying hysterically as they gagged her mouth and tied her arms and legs apart on the table. The people in the room surrounded the table as they began to chant words that Kimberly could not understand.  The Queen and Prince of darkness stood beside the table in long black robes with hoods over their heads. "Let us begin the birth of the child." Otis spoke in a demonic voice.  Kimberly began screaming as the large knife began to cut into her flesh, the pain was unbearable for her, her screams could be heard through out the entire house and woods. It was not long before they lifted the child out of her womb and wrapped it in a black cloth. The Princess of darkness turned to the unconscious Kimberly with the large dagger and with one swipe slit her throat. "Feast my people and rejoice the Princess of darkness birth," she said holding the baby in the air over her head. Kimberly's lifeless body was then devoured by the demonic creatures surrounding her.  The Queen of darkness held the child in her arms proud that she had gotten what she wanted most ." you my child will rule all of the dark side bringing death, plagues, chaos amongst the earth." She said feeding the child from her breast that had filled with milk." Yes my little princess feed from mother." She told the baby as her eyes glowed  It was time to go to the old mansion to do battle with the demons; the ride was quiet as they prayed to the heavens protect them. They parked the car on the side of the road by the woods as they began their journey. As they were walking all of their flash lights went dead." What caused that to happen?" Norma asked.  "Evil is trying to stop us." She told them as she kept walking.  "How will we see our way through the woods?" Saunders asked he was unable to see two feet in front of him it was so black.  A brilliant light glowed above them as Cheyenne motioned for them to follow her. She led the way to the abandoned mansion. They were following her through the halls until she disappeared from sight.  "Where did she go?" Hank asked trying to find her.  "Where she is needed the most." Aggatha told them. "We must hurry." She told them.  They could feel the evil around them as they walked down the hall to a large wooden door. Aggatha opened it slowly." Their in there, Norma no matter what, keep this door locked letting no one out. Here is a vial for you, do not use it all at once, a few drops on their skin will release them from the bodies and back where they belong." She said handing each one of them a vial with the potion.  They entered the room; the demons began walking slowly towards them, hissing at them with their distorted faces. Aggatha began repeating a verse." With this potion, send these demons from whence they come, setting their trip to hell in motion." She kept repeating it repeatedly.  The drops hit each demon; they fell to the ground returning back into the women who were abducted. When Hank hit Otis with the potion who was now in his pure demonic form, with huge ears, his body was like a lizard with a long tail that he would whip around his body, smoke rose off his skin as he screamed out in torment then burst into flames. They saw Cheyenne's body fall to the floor before they could hit the Queen of darkness with the potion, Cheyenne had been able to pull the evil witches soul from her body and they battled. The Queen of darkness was trying to destroy her so she could remain in Cheyenne's body.  The Queen of darkness was throwing balls of fire at Cheyenne and at everyone else in the room. They sought cover from her. Cheyenne began to repeat the verse that Aggatha was repeating as she raised her hand with a snow-white glowing ball in her hand hitting the Queen of darkness with it causing her to explode into a ball of fire, all the demons followed her into the ball and exploded.  They all watched Cheyenne's soul hovering above her body lying on the floor then slowly she went back into her body. She laid their still without any movement from her. Hank ran to her picking her up into his arms." Don't you leave me now Cheyenne, come back baby I love you." He said cradling her in his arms.  Cheyenne looked up into his eyes smiling; she was weak from her battle." I love you Hank," she whispered wrapping her arms around him." I felt so much love coming at me from all directions making me stronger to beat the Dark Side." She told him with her eyes closed a look of peace on her face.  Hank looked at Roger." It was mine and Rogers love for you that you were feeling that gave you the strength." He told her giving Roger the credit he deserved.  Hank helped Cheyenne to stand up and she hugged Roger, "I will never let you take that love away from me, as I will never take my love that I have for you away." She told him kissing him softly on his lips. She looked over to where Kimberly's mutilated body still lay on the table." Oh sweet Jesus!" she cried out." They killed her, I wasn't in time!" She cried into Rogers's chest.  They heard the baby crying under the table.  " It's still alive!" Aggatha said as she reached under the table." We must get her to the hospital quickly." She said looking at Cheyenne.  " You my child have been chosen to watch over her and to protect her."  Cheyenne smiled taking the tiny infant in her arms." I will protect you little one, we all will be here to protect you." She said smiling down at the newly born infant not weighing more then a pound.  They all waited at the hospital where the baby was placed in NICU until they could get her weight from 2 lbs to 5lbs before she could leave the hospital.  As they were leaving the hospital Roger looked at Aggatha." Where do you go from here?" he asked looking at the sweet old woman.  "As it turns out I am seeking a nanny job." She said smiling at Hank and Cheyenne.  Everyone yelled at one time." Your hired!" they all began laughing as the other women's families showed up to be reunited with them.  "Remember we all must keep quiet of what really took place." Aggatha told them." Or they may remove the child from us and that cannot happen if we are to protect her."  Hank, Cheyenne and Aggatha went back to the house Aggatha looked at Cheyenne from the back seat." Cheyenne we will need to talk because my child your life is no longer as it once was. You and the other women have been chosen to fight off evil for ever, not just this one time. Every day that passes you will notice more powers given to you." She said trying to break this to her easy.  Cheyenne turned to look at Aggatha from the front seat. "What are you trying to say Aggatha?" she asked feeling this was something she really didn't want to hear.  "I was around when Fredrick killed his family those many years ago." She told her seeing the confusion in her face.   "Your over two hundred years old?" Hank asked with a look of disbelief.  "We will talk more at the house." Aggatha told them.  The rest of the ride was silent as they each wondered what was going to happen to their once normal lives.  Once inside the house they all sat at the table, Aggatha taking a deep breath." The good thing about this Cheyenne, you and the other women will never age. You have been chosen since birth to defend goodness against all evil." She said trying to make this is easy on her.  "Never age? But we all age, how else do we grow old and die?" she asked her beginning to understand, but not really wanting to accept what has happened.  "Yes mortals live and die while there are some who die and are chosen to come back to conquer evil." Aggatha told her wishing she could take her into her arms.  With a look of fear on her face. "I am dead is what your telling me?" she asked.  "You were dead, but you were sent back with certain conditions and powers." She told her.  "What about Hank? I will have to go through eternity without him?" she said as tears came to her eyes.  "Only after he lives and dies from old age, you will be able to live a normal husband and wife relationship until then." She told them.  "How will I know when I get these powers and how to use them?" Cheyenne asked.  "You will know when you obtain them and it will be natural to use them to you as if you always had them." She explained." We will tell the other ones tomorrow. Oh and we all must relocate to another location." she told them as it all sank into Cheyenne's and Hanks minds." As for the child we must be grateful that she did not have time to suckle from the breast of the Queen of darkness other wise her blood would have been past through the milk to the infant and we would have had to kill her." Aggatha said as the thought was distasteful to her." Even though Fredrick's blood flows through her body he was not always evil, there was a time he was good and the only woman he ever loved through all these years was a powerful warrior of the white light as he him self was." Aggatha told them as tears wailed up in her eyes. "Then he became greedy and wanted more and turned to the Dark Side as their leader.  "What became of the one he loved?" Cheyenne asked Aggatha.   "His love for her was not strong enough to keep him from killing her." Aggatha said thinking of that horrible night." Enough, you will learn more later." She told Cheyenne.  Cheyenne and Hank retired to their bedroom, Cheyenne was reluctant to have sexual relations with him after her ordeal with the demons sexual rituals they had put her body through, she could still see Gore warrior's face pleasuring himself using her body to do it.  Hank became upset with her resisting him. "Are you trying to tell me I remind you of him?" he asked feeling angered by her refusing his sexual advances.  "No damn it! I do not want sex with anyone!" she yelled smashing her vase with the carnations with just one glance at it. "Well I guess I have a power now!" She said going to the patio to sit and think.  Roger lay out on the couch listening to the argument wishing he could comfort her, but knowing he could not do anything without provoking Hank.   Six years later.  The whole household was preparing for Gina's birthday, Norma baked her a birthday cake in the shape of a teddy bear. The other women were busy decorating the house with streamers and balloons, the men had bought her a brand new bicycle, with a baby doll in a small cradle .Aggatha brought the child down stairs dressed in a white lace dress, with white anklets around the tops of them, her long brown hair was in long curly ringlets.  "Here is the birthday girl." Aggatha said as she brought Gina to the kitchen where her cake was waiting with six candles on it.  Gina looked at the cake smiling as they lit the candles for her." Do I get to blow them out now?" she asked so sweetly.  "Yes Gina, blow out the candles then make a wish." Norma told her as everyone stood around the table singing happy birthday to her.  Gina blew out all the candles on the cake then sat in a chair for her cake and ice cream.  " Hurry so I open my gifts." She said smiling.   Norma fixed everyone a plate of the cake and ice cream, as everyone was about to eat Gina threw her plate on the floor." I hate strawberry cake you moron!" she yelled at Norma.  "That is enough Gina!" Cheyenne yelled at the little girl with a very stern expression.  "I am so sorry Cheyenne." She said looking at her sadly.  "Maybe we shouldn't give you any gifts for your actions here at the table!" Cheyenne fumed as she scolded the child.  Gina looking at her lap with tears flowing down her cheeks." Please Cheyenne please! I will eat the cake. I am sorry grandma for being bad." Gina said looking up from her lap.  "You better eat every piece of cake and ice cream, then maybe and only maybe you can have your gifts." she told her.   "Now before you eat you will clean up that mess you made." She told the child pointing at the broken plate on the floor.  Gina cleaned up the mess she made from her temper tantrum; she then sat at the table eating her cake and ice cream. After everyone had finished they led Gina into the living room with a scarf around her eyes so she could not see her gifts waiting for her. Gina opened all her gifts with excitement; she hugged the baby placing her in the cradle. When she saw her new pink bike that had a bell , a white basket and pink and white fringe hanging from the handles she was very pleased." Oh thank you!" she said with a huge smile." You're the best family!" she told them looking at her new bike. "May I ride it now?" she asked them with an angelic expression.  "Change into your play clothes first." Lindsey told her.  "Alright!" she yelled excited to be able to ride her new bike.  The rest of the afternoon Gina rode her bike around the grounds of the farm. She would laugh as she tried to run the chickens over with her bike. She spent the day tormenting the animals when no one was watching her, Ralph and Ninja lay under the tractor growling and hissing at the child.  That night Gina was to start school the next day, which the rest of the household was grateful it meant they would have a break from the high-strung child.  Morning soon came and time for Gina to get ready for her first day of school, Norma dressed her in a red corduroy dress that buttoned at the shoulders, a white long sleeve shirt, with white knee high socks and black paten shoes, and her hair was pulled up in a pony tail. When Gina entered, her class she was seated next to a little girl with blond curly hair named Sammy who was dressed in a pink ruffled dress, pink anklet with black paten leather shoes.   Gina saw the little girl's necklace with a ruby stone and Gina wanted it." I'll give you this candy bar for your necklace." She told Sammy.  "No my grand ma gave it to me before she died last year." She told Gina.  Gina gave Sammy a dirty look for she wanted that necklace. At recess, Gina played with Sammy on the swings when she saw some woods.  " let's go into the woods and look around," she told her new friend.  "Ok, but not too far or we will get into trouble." Sammy told her as they ran into the woods just as the recess bell rang for them to return to class." we have to go." She told Gina turning around to go back to class.  "Wait what is over in that tree?" Gina asked walking over to it as Sammy followed behind her.  Mrs. Harris came to the edge of the woods "come out of there and return to class!" She yelled into the woods.  Gina came running out of the woods." Sammy is still in there, I told her to come on but she went running deeper into the woods!" She told the teacher acting so concerned.  "Well come on Gina, I will tell the principle he will go find her." Mrs. Harris told her as she put her hand on Gina's back leading her towards the school building.  As they were walking Gina looked back over her shoulder." I wonder what she is doing in there? " Gina asked the teacher.  "Getting into trouble that is what she is doing." Mrs. Harris told her.  Once back in class Gina kept looking at the door but no one ever came in. the school bell rang at the end of the day." Why didn't Sammy come back to class Mrs. Harris?" she asked her teacher as she was grading papers.  "She probably spent the rest of the day in the principles office." She told her not looking up from her paper work." Now go on your parents will be waiting for you." Her teacher said never looking up once.  "See you tomorrow Mrs. Harris." Gina told her with a huge smile on her face until she ran to the hallway where she saw three police officers standing in the hallway. Gina quickly ran out side to catch her ride home with Hank.  Hank saw the police cars as he pulled up in front of the school; he waited outside the car until he saw Gina." How was school today?" he asked her as he opened her car door.  "Fine I got to swing on the swing set today. Do you think we could get a swing set at home Hank?" she asked him as they drove past the police cars.  "We will see what kind of grades you have on your report card and if they are good then yes." He told her as they drove home.  When they pulled up in front of the house Roger was sitting on the front porch." Gina I need to ask you a question." He told her.  "What do you want to ask me Roger?" she asked him as she sat next to him on the bench swing.  "You told your teacher you saw Sammy running deeper into the woods at recess." He told her taking her hand.  "Yes we heard the bell and I told her we better go back, but she went running more into the woods saying she saw something, then Mrs. Harris called and I told her Sammy just kept running into the woods." She told him with wide eyes." is Sammy in trouble?" she asked him.  "No Gina, Sammy is not in trouble, did you see anyone else in the woods?" he asked her looking at her face.  "No Roger I didn't see no one else." Gina told him with a curious look.  "Sammy got hurt in the woods today and she won't be going back to school anymore." He told her as he was filled with sorrow.  "Why won't she be going back to school?" she asked Roger looking even more curious then ever.  "Sammy went to heaven today." Roger told her as gently as he could as tears came to his eyes remembering how her tiny body laid lifeless and mangled.  "No! She was my friend!" Gina yelled as she ran to her room slamming the door behind her.  Hank looked at Roger, "what happened in the woods?" he asked knowing there was more to it then Roger could tell Gina.  "Someone with brut force smashed that child's head in with a rock." He told Hank shaking his head." you could hardly tell she was human. Her tiny face was smashed in so badly." He said breaking down into tears." I am going to find that bastard who did this to that kid and I pray he tries to smash me with a rock!" Roger said with his hand on his gun and the look of hate in his eyes.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 05 by Erotica_Writings ©  Gina laid in her bed smiling as she dangled the ruby red necklace over her as she watched how the light made it sparkle. She quickly got up and hid the necklace deep in her toy box. "No one will find you in here," she said then going back to her bed when she heard someone coming.  Cheyenne walked into the room seeing the child lying on her bed crying." Are you ok sweetie?" Cheyenne asked sitting on the side of the bed stroking Gina's hair as she lay on her stomach crying.  "Why did she have to go to heaven for?" she asked Cheyenne.  "That is where good people go to live when they die here on earth." Cheyenne explained to her.  "Leave me alone I don't want to talk to anyone." Gina told her.  Cheyenne left her alone as she went to her room where Hank was sitting." Who would kill a child?" he asked trying to find an answer.  "Someone very sick or very evil did this." Cheyenne told him.  "Have you had any visions?" he asked her.  "No not this time." She said sitting on the bed with her head down as she failed an innocent child whose life was taken before her time was up on earth.   "Why did I not get a vision? Why was that child sacrificed to evil?" she cried out in pain as tears streaked her face.  "I am going to go shower," she told him patting his hand letting him know she was ok. As the hot water ran down her face it felt so relaxing as she opened her eyes the water had turned to blood running down her body.  " Oh my God!" she said realizing it was an illusion trying to tell her something. I need to go look around the area where the child was murdered. She thought to her self. The water began to run clear then. Realizing this is what something was trying to tell her." ok I got your message loud and clear." she said as she finished showering. Cheyenne grabbed a pair of black jeans, a white blouse with black stripes; she put on a pair of black boots that just fit around her ankles. She wore her hair up a ponytail as she noticed her hair was starting to turn dark brown. "Want to ride with me to the crime scene Hank?" she asked as he was lying across on the bed on his back in just a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers.  " Sure let me put a shirt on." He told her putting on a blue t-shirt.  As they were going out the door she grabbed his ass." We may not make it to the crime scene you keep that up." He said smiling at her.  As they drove to the school, Cheyenne thought to her self what am I suppose to find. They saw Roger and Saunders standing by their car. Cheyenne got out of the car walking up to the two men." May we see the crime scene?" she asked as she saw how disturbed they were by the looks on their faces.  "Yeah maybe you can figure out who did it so we can accidentally slip a rock into the monsters skull!" Saunders told them hoping that Cheyenne would see something they could not.  As the four of them walked to where the murder happened Cheyenne saw the rock was still there that had been used to kill the child. The crime scene unit had not removed it yet, she bent over to pick it up. As soon as Cheyenne picked it up she suddenly fell to the ground backing up as fast as she could as if she was trying to escape from something horrible, she began screaming and covering her head with her arms as if to stop something from hitting her." No! Please!" Cheyenne began screaming, her body jerking uncontrollably then she past out as a trickle of blood ran down from her mouth.  Hank held her in his arms." She must have seen something that scared the hell out of her." He told them trying to revive her.  "Out of all the years I have known this feisty lady, this is the first time I have seen her so scared." Roger said feeling relieved when he saw she was coming too.  Cheyenne opened her eyes they were wide full of fear as her body was still slightly shaky." It was a demon." She told them as she cried feeling the pain of the little girl.  "Why were you so scared?" Hank asked her.  "I went into Sammy when she was being murdered, she was so frightened." Cheyenne told them as tears fell from her eyes." It was so ugly, green, with red glowing eyes, it had fang like teeth, long fingers nails, it just kept bashing at her head, and it took a necklace off of her neck before it finished killing her." She said crying as she saw the death." I guess I past out because that was when she died." She told them using the hanker chief Roger handed her.  Cheyenne stood up looking around the woods.  " Where ever your hiding demon from hell I plan on killing you slowly before sending you back to the fires to burn for eternity!" she yelled almost as if she wanted it to appear so she could battle it now." I will have my day with you since I have seen you! Appear before me I demand you!" she said looking around." You coward! Your not even worthy of being a demon!" she yelled trying to provoke it to appear in front of her. Tears ran down her face out of anger, frustration and pain from the small child's grizzly murder.  Hank put his hand on her shoulder. "It's not going to appear Cheyenne." He told her trying to calm her down.  "It killed her over a damned necklace!" She told them." I plan on giving it a necklace to carry to hell with it." She told them, she felt so angry.  Gina heard Cheyenne summoning her to appear before them and hid from her.  Hank took Cheyenne back to the house where the others were waiting. Cheyenne looked at the other women." we have a demon that killed a child over a necklace. I want this one so bad I can taste it!" she told them as she was filled with anger.  Gina sat at the top of the stairs listening then hurried back to her bedroom." Cheyenne can not find out it was me, not until I am older then I will destroy them all." She said to herself sitting on her bed grinning as she thought of their destruction." I will revenge my parent's death and rule my kingdom as it is meant to be." She said lying down on her bed." I will have to create a diversion." She said smiling so evilly.  The next few weeks everything was quiet even Gina who was being very well behaved. Cheyenne and the other women worked out everyday to keep them selves in shape. A young man with black hair, blue eyes and muscular build, came up to the house with his shirt hanging out of his tight blue jeans, his cowboy boots had cleats on them. He singled Cheyenne out of the group." I was wondering if you had a few odd jobs I could do and a place to lie down at night, the barn would be great." He said looking deep into her eyes like he was reading her soul.  Cheyenne felt herself not being able to take her eyes away from his as if he was putting her in a trance as she looked back into his eyes her words were slowly spoken. "We can find something for you to do here," she said still not taking her eyes from his.  "May I sleep in your barn?" he asked as he smiled showing the whitest teeth she had ever seen.  "Yes of course you may." She answered as she was acting even stranger now.  He held his hand out for her to shake it; as soon as their hands met she had a tingling sensation going through her body." Thank you misses. Sorry I didn't get your name," he told her.  "It's Cheyenne," she said still in a trance like state.  "If it would not be too much trouble could you show me where I will be sleeping and what ever you wish of me to do for you?" He told Cheyenne as he eyed her body up and down smiling as if he was taking her clothes off.  "Yes come with me." She told him as she walked to the barn as he had his hand on the small of her back.  The other women watched as Cheyenne walked away with the man.  " We better go tell Aggatha, Cheyenne acts like she has been put in a trance or something." Gloria said worried about the presence of this man.  The women ran to the house where Aggatha was cooking dinner  ." Aggatha! Something is wrong with Cheyenne! This guy came up here and she acted like she was in a trance as soon as their eyes met, she is letting him sleep in the barn and work here." Gloria told Aggatha talking so fast the woman had a hard time comprehending what she was saying.  Aggatha looked strange at the women." Oh no it must be a warlock sent here to destroy Cheyenne since she is our strongest with the most powers." She told the women. "Are they in the barn now?" she asked in an agitated voice.  "Yes." The women said in unison.  Aggatha ran to the barn where she found Cheyenne in the arms of the man as he was kissing her and holding her body tightly against his. Running his hands down her back, pressing her hips against the erection he was getting.  " Take your hands off of her Justin!" Aggatha demanded.  Justin looked up at Aggatha from kissing Cheyenne who did not try to break away from him." I don't think she wants me to let her go mother." He said smiling down at Cheyenne as she was breathing heavily looking at him as he pulled her tighter to him and she began to lick his neck. "Can't you see your stopping me from giving her what she wants?" He taunted Aggatha as he laid Cheyenne down on a haystack and placing his body on top of her.   "I should have destroyed you when I had the chance!" she told him.  "You couldn't kill your own son now mother could you?" He said taunting her even more. "But if you want to watch us take a seat." he told as she was kissing his neck as she ran her hands over his body.  "You have her under a spell take it off of her now Justin!" she   ordered her son.  "You should have joined forces with me and father instead of taking the side of the white light!" he yelled as he flew Aggatha up against the wall with one swipe of his hand.  "This is your strongest warrior and I am going to make her my bride to lead the Dark Side by my side." He said running his fingers down Cheyenne's cleavage as she moaned from his touch.  Aggatha picked herself up summoning the other women who appeared by her side." You must destroy him to break the spell he has put on Cheyenne." She told them.  He laughed at them." You bitches could not hurt anyone," he laughed as he licked Cheyenne's neck while she was becoming limp in his arms.  "Cheyenne Hank loves you! Fight for him if nothing else!" Tammy yelled at her seeing she was becoming weaker in his arms.  This angered Justin he turned towards her sending her flying through the air in to a wall." Shut up you bitch!" he ordered as he turned demonic looking.  The other women began to walk toward him when they saw Cheyenne began to move, her eyes then opened as she looked at Justin." You have just met your match mother fucker!" she yelled at him then sent him into the wall behind him with using both of her hands without touching him. Not giving him a chance to get his senses, she sent him flying across the room. With one leap she jumped up in the air flying on top of him where they fought, as he got on top of her with his hands strangling her Tammy flew through the air hitting him directly in his head with her feet sending him flying off of Cheyenne. The women all stood together in unison." return to the lake of hell where you whence came never to return to a place that the good and innocent dwell." They said as they held their hands straight out at him watching the flames of fire suck him into its hole.  "Why did you not kill him?" Aggatha asked Cheyenne.  "He is your son; if you couldn't destroy him then don't expect us too. He won't come back here again." She said as she looked disappointed at Aggatha." Why did you lie and tell us we were Guardian angels when in fact we are witches?" She asked the elderly woman.  Aggatha looked at the women." I did not think you could handle knowing the truth, but there are good witches who help the innocent mortals and supernatural beings that are not evil. How did you figure it out?" she asked  "I have all my powers now that is how I broke his spell on me." She told her.  "Cheyenne you have been chosen to lead the good from birth. None of your parents were normal mortals that is why they took you eight because you were meant to be powerful warriors to save us when the time of the war of good verses evil." She explained.  The women looked at each other." but they can place spells on us?" Lindsey asked.  "We are just as vulnerable to spells as any other person or witch." Cheyenne told them." Let's go to the house." She told them as she walked with her head down.  At the house Cheyenne was angry with her parents." Why didn't they tell me?" why did they leave me in an orphanage?" she asked aloud.  All the women realized they were all placed in orphanages." Why did our parents give us up?" they asked.  Just then a bright light came into the room it was the parents of the eight women." oh, our sweet daughter we had to place you there before we were destroyed that night. We did it to protect you as did the others parents place the other girls. Fredrick had us all destroyed except for Aggatha who they let live thinking she was one of them. She did well keeping her secret until she knew you were ready to take over then moved you here." Cheyenne's mother told her.  "To Salem for Christ sake where they killed people who they thought was witches? This is where you had her to bring us?" Cheyenne cried out.  "This was our home at one time and this is where you eight girls had to come to get your powers. Someone leaked it out to the Dark Side you girls are here. But who?" her father asked wondering who could have betrayed them.  "I suppose the one who I will be doing battle with in the future." Cheyenne told them." Some where there is a Princess of Darkness I will be fighting, just when I do not know." She told them.  "We must go now; take care of your selves more will come to stop you." Tammy's mother told them.  The women looked at each other knowing the truth, but it did not make it feel any better. Cheyenne went to the basement where she found a hidden door inside were oils, charms, candles, the tools that they would need to help them survive. She felt like she had been here before for it seemed so familiar to her when her cat Ninja ran up to her rubbing her legs." Well boy they say witches have black cats and here we are." She said picking the cat up in her arms.  The other women came into the room with her." Wow look at this place." Alicia said touching the oils.  "We use a drop of the oil in our baths it will help to give us protection against our enemies." She told them.  "Why didn't it protect our parents?" Gloria asked.  "It was meant to be." Cheyenne said as she found charms.  " These must be meant for us since there are eight of them here." She said handing each one to the women.  "Another form of protection for us." Lindsey said." It makes me mad that we were lied too." She said placing her charm on her neck, as did the others.  "When do you think it will take place?" Tammy asked.  "In ten years we go to battle." Cathy said.  "And they will keep coming before that time to destroy us." Patty told them.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne Sat quietly in the window as the snow glistened the ground remembering the day this all started........  The year is 1972 Cheyenne and Hank Thompson pulled their car up in front of what appeared to be a normal looking house set in a quiet neighborhood, they were not prepared for what was waiting for them on the other side of the door. An elderly lady dressed in a long black dress, black shoes, and her gray hair up in a bun greeted them. She looks like she should be in a horror flick Cheyenne thought to herself as she shook the woman’s hand.   "Come in please "the woman spoke in almost a whisper.  Cheyenne wore a mid calf straight white skirt, a matching white cropped jacket, a light blue blouse, revealing her hour glass shape, She wore white heels, Her blonde hair worn up in a bun on top of her head, She looked at her husband Hank hesitantly as they entered the house.  "Please follow me Mrs. Harrelson is waiting for you in the den Mr. and Mrs. Thompson." she said turning to lead them down the hall way.  "How did you know our last name?" Cheyenne asked since they had not told her who they were.  The woman turned towards Cheyenne with a humble smile. "You are the only appointment for today my dear, so I just assumed it was you at the door," she continued to walk down the hall slowly.  "Oh." Cheyenne replied as she looked at the family’s portraits hanging on the wall.  Hank a quiet man was observing their surroundings and the fact that all of the drapes were pulled shut prohibiting sunlight from entering the house. He unbuttoned the top button of his white dress shirt, he smoothed out his black dress slacks, wishing he could take off the gray jacket as he walked down the hall way, his black dress shoes could use a good shining, but he didn’t have time since he woke up late this morning. God this place is depressing, he thought to himself as he smoothed his short graying hair.  The woman opened the door to the den where a young frail looking woman sat behind a large red oak desk with just a small gold desk lamp lighting the room.  "Your appointment is here Mrs. Harrelson." The woman informed the other woman.  Cheyenne noticed how beautiful the woman was with her long red hair hanging loosely to her waist, her eyes were an Icy blue, Cheyenne noticed that with her pale white skin, the red lipstick complimented the emerald green dress she wore. Her eyes held a sadness that grabbed Cheyenne’s heart when she looked into them with her own dark brown eyes.  "Thank you for coming to see me, the sun light gives me intolerable migraines in case you’re wondering why I keep my house so dark." The woman said as she rose from the huge brown leather chair behind the desk.  "It’s a pleasure to meet you Mrs. Harrelson." Hank said shaking her hand.  "Please sit down." Mrs. Harrelson told them pointing to the two brown chairs in front of the desk.  "I want to hire you to find out what my husband is up to. You see our bank accounts are missing money , he stays away for days at a time, he says it is business, but I feel it is something more than that. I do not believe he is seeing another woman, but he has to be up to something that could cause harm to everyone around him." Mrs. Harrelson’s voice stayed very calm and even toned as she spoke.  "Do you have any idea as to what it could be that he is doing?" Hank asked as he sat back in his chair.  "Young women seem to disappear during the times he is gone, I can give you the dates when he has been away to help you find out if he is the one behind these women’s disappearances." Her eyes began to tear up as she spoke.  "You mean the rash of women that have vanished from parking lots in the last six months?" Cheyenne asked as she looked at Hank with a confused expression on her face.  "Yes." Her tears streaked her face as she looked down at the top of her desk.  "Why didn’t you just call the police?" Cheyenne asked as she crossed her leg’s, she could tell the woman was in severe pain, was it from her migraines or the thought that her husband had something to do with six women disappearing without a trace of them anywhere.  "The police would have questioned him and he would have known that it was me. I don’t want him knowing any of this if it’s not him." her eyes were wide as she spoke." Here is a note book of the dates when he left, where he was supposed to have been at on those dates. The rest you will have to find out your selves, I am willing to pay you one thousand a day that should cover any expenses and then five thousand when you know if it’s him or not." She told them as she ran her hand over her forehead to help ease the pain of her migraine.  Hank cleared his voice as he looked at the woman." We can start tomorrow if that is soon enough for you?" he stood up looking around the richly decorated den.  "Yes and thank you." She told them rising up from the desk." you will keep me informed on a daily basis correct?" she smiled at them as she held her hand out to shake theirs.  "Yes at the end of each day around six o’clock and no later then ten o’clock one of us will call you." Cheyenne told her straightening out her skirt as she rose from the chair.  Hank and Cheyenne entered the hall way and they were met by the gray haired woman." I will show you out." She told them as she showed them to the front door.  Man she is creepy, Cheyenne thought to her self as she followed behind the woman. Cheyenne could not wait to be in their car for she felt something would jump out at them from behind a door as they walked by.  Once inside of the car Cheyenne was relieved to be away from the eerie little old woman." Do you think she might be right?" she asked her husband as they drove slowly down the road.  Hank was looking at the houses around them. "I don’t know, but we were hired to find out and that’s what we will do." He said as he turned the car on to Federal highway.  "They have money that’s for sure; you aren’t middle class living off Bay Shore drive." Cheyenne said as she thumbed through the note book.  At the office Cheyenne thought how Mrs. Harrelson’s den made the office look drab with the white walls, the two brown desk and one window that Cheyenne could look out to see cars traveling down Federal high way. Cheyenne looked at the gray filing cabinets that held the clients they had acquired since they opened a year ago.  We will have a view of the ocean one day, she thought to herself.  Hank checked out the hotels that Fredrick Harrelson was suppose to stay at during the last six month’s while Cheyenne through some of the old news papers still in their office on a table in the corner. She looked through the news archives to see if the dates matched with the dates the women who had disappeared off the face of the earth.  "Hey babe one thing they all had in common they were single, in their forties, and had brown hair, they were all very beautiful." Cheyenne told him as she read each story." Cheyenne noticed all the women had disappeared in the afternoon. " well we know he strikes in the afternoon."  "Or she." Hank said looking up from the note book.  "Or what she?" Cheyenne asked looking at her husband puzzled by what he said.  "It could be a she, we don’t know if this guy is connected in any way to these women disappearing Cheyenne." He told her never looking up from the note book. "I guess I should fly out to Colorado since that was the first trip he made six months ago right at the time when the first disappearance occurred, maybe I can find out something on this guy." He told Cheyenne as he picked up the phone.  Cheyenne looked at the photo of Fredrick Harrelson that his wife had also supplied in the note book. He looked very handsome with chiseled features, slightly graying hair and not one hair out of place; he was fifty years old, married to his wife who was only thirty six years old, His eyes were almost black as coal, she felt like he was watching her through those eyes of the picture. These people remind me of the old horror movies with Bella Lugosi. She thought to herself as a shiver went through her body.  Hank interrupted her thoughts. "I leave Ft. Lauderdale at seven o’clock in the morning." Hank told his wife as he came up behind her as she sat working on the case he kissed her lightly on top of her head.  She swirled around in her chair. "How long do you think you will be gone?" she asked.  "I will try to come back home just as fast as I can." He knew how much she hated being alone in the house. "Ralph will be there with you to keep you company." He told her as he smiled trying to reassure her.  "Now you’re a comedian, Ralph is the only German Shepard who is scared of his own shadow." She said with a smile thinking of their big bad dog who would give them away to a burglar as long as they did not hurt him or take his food.  "You can come with me." He said smiling down at her.  "No way am I getting on a plane! Besides I need to do my research here, I just need to figure out how to talk with the Detectives with out giving away our client." Cheyenne said as she looked at her husband with a puzzled look hoping he would have the answer.  "I am sure you will figure it out baby." He told her knowing that she could pull it off.  Cheyenne was not surprised that this would be his answer to her. What did she expect he left almost every decision to her to make. She looked at him sarcastically.  " Thanks for the confidence there slugger." She said laughingly as she turned her back to him and began reading the papers about the women.  That night at home Cheyenne stepped into the hot shower awaiting her aching body, the hot steamy water felt great on her skin as she soaped up her body into a rich lather and loving the smell of the foamy soap .Cheyenne felt her skin become covered in goose bumps and that same eerie feeling she had earlier today had returned. Hank was busy packing his suit case while she showered and hoping he would not be gone for more then a few days on this trip. He would have to travel to all three states that Fredrick Harrelson had been to in the last six months on his business trips. He loved their small ranch house that he and Cheyenne bought eight months ago, it was quiet and out in Coral Springs. He knew Cheyenne would be alright while he was gone; he just hated having to leave her by herself when he had to travel out of town on cases. He ignored Ralph’s growling at the window as he laid at the foot of their bed.  Hank looked around their bedroom that Cheyenne had decorated, building the entertainment system and dressers into the walls gave them more space. Hank looked around the room feeling a strangeness he had never felt before, as if eyes were upon him, Hank shook it off that Cheyenne's wild imagination was rubbing off on him. He looked out the French colonial windows with black shears; he bumped into the small round table draped in a pink table cover holding a black and pink vase with pink carnations. He stepped backwards thinking he had seen someone in the shadows outside, he stepped out onto the patio to see if his eyes were playing tricks on him.  Cheyenne stepped out of the glass encased shower, sitting next to it was a deep round Jacuzzi tub with candles sitting on the step leading into it. She had designed the tub & sinks in pink pearl with gold faucets, the bath room gave her many a relaxing night where she could unwind. She wrapped the large white towel around her body, wrapping her hair up in a smaller white towel, she sat at her make up table in the corner of the bathroom as she applied make up to her face, she blow dried her hair then splashed perfume lightly over her body, she slipped into her black satin night gown with black lace across her breast and lace straps across her shoulders. She slipped into black spiked heels entering the bedroom, but she found Hank sitting on the patio leading out of the bedroom.   There was a patio table with chairs, in the mornings they drank coffee there. Cheyenne turned on the stereo playing the song look at little sister, swaying her body to the music in front of Hank rubbing her hands over her body, she straddled both of his legs moving her body seductively over him, he took her in his arms kissing her passionately.  "I want you right here and right now." He told her caressing her breast.   "Mmmm take me now." She whispered as his fingers found the wetness between her thighs.   "Ahhhh yes" she said as he unfastened his pants going deep inside of her body. She moved her body to the beat of the music playing on the stereo, her movements were causing his thirst for her to grow hotter and wilder as he grabbed the back of her hair and rammed himself deep and hard inside of her sticky sweet juices until they both exploded into a powerful orgasm. "God the star spangled banner baby!" she laughed as she laid her head on his chest.  "Wow star spangled banner huh?" he laughed as he took a deep breath." Sure you don’t want to make fire works in Colorado?"  She smiled looking into his eyes." No." she said smacking his cheek softly.  That night they slept in each other’s arms until the clock woke them at five o’clock in the morning. Hank did not want to be late for his flight. The hardest thing she had to do was to leave him at the air port; on the way home she played the song Baby I want you by Bread. It was a lonely ride home for her. She entered the house greeted by Ralph barking at her." You are supposed to greet me with licks and a wagging tail dummy, not bark at Me.," she said as she patted the dogs head. The living room she decorated with a country style. Pictures of horses running hung on the brown wooden walls. The fireplace had a large rug in front of it on the wooden floor. She hurried into the bedroom to dress to go to the police department to see what she could learn. She wore a pair of blue jeans with a black T-shirt, a blue denim jacket with brown boots. She wore her blonde hair worn down and parted in the middle. Her make up was applied in light brown shades, she lightly applied blush to make her cheek bones stand out.  She drove to the police station to speak with the detectives in charge of the case; she waited in the lobby for the detective to meet her. She felt a strange sensation in her stomach when she saw her ex boyfriend of three years… Roger O’berst, he was the man Cheyenne had loved for three years and he was the man who broke her heart just before meeting Hank.   He walked up to her smiling and she could feel the heat rising in her face seeing him for the first time since their break up. She noticed he had not changed much since they were last together, his temples had started to gray ever so slightly but he still had dark brown hair, his brown eyes were almost hypnotizing and penetrating when he looked into her eyes. He was tall with a thin build, but muscular in stature. Great, this is not what I needed! Running into Roger today! she thought to herself as he stood smiling down at her.  "Cheyenne why are you here?" he asked taking her hand into his.  "I am waiting to speak to someone in charge of the case of the missing women from the parking lot that is all." She told him feeling very nervous around him. She looked anxiously at her watch.  He smiled "Well would you want to talk over coffee?" he said with a smug smile. His charm could be very disarming to someone who did not know him.  Looking at him wide eyed trying to keep her cool with out blowing any chance of getting what she needed to help their case. ****! Now what am I suppose to do? She thought to herself." Coffee sounds great Roger." Her smile was so friendly, but inside she felt like daggers were waiting to shoot through her body and straight into his ass. She giggled to herself thinking how funny that would look.  "Good we’ll go in my car to the doughnut shop on Atlantic boulevard then." He said guiding her out side to the back parking lot where his white crown Victoria was parked.  "I can just follow you in my car Roger." She told him as he unlocked her door.  "Nonsense Cheyenne, it’s been along time since I have had the pleasure of your company." He smiled as he shut the car door for her.  God he really adds extra charm when he is up to something. She thought to herself as she watched him get in the car.  "How is married life Cheyenne?" He asked putting his arm on the back of the seat as he backed out of the parking space.  She looked out the car window." Good Roger." She did not want to talk about her life with him.  "Could have been us you know Cheyenne." He looked at her as they sat at the red light.  Cheyenne began to laugh, "Oh please Roger! The only commitment you wanted was the commitment of sex and nothing more! If you could have had a harem you might have been happy for awhile." She sat shaking her head as she smiled out the car window.  "Sounds like you are still jealous babe." He smiled as he knew how to push her buttons.  "Oh Roger please! Don’t sound so foolish ok?" She said smugly crossing her arms as she remained staring out the window. Us and how many others would their have been too? She asked herself as they pulled into the parking lot of the doughnut shop.  Cheyenne could not wait to get back to her car and away from him, she just needed to see what he would tell her if anything.  They sat across the table from each other sipping the hot coffee it actually helped to ease her tension.  "What is your interest in this case Cheyenne?" he asked looking deep into her eyes.  "Well we have a client who hired us to find out what her husband is doing when he is away on trips." She was trying not to give to much information for now.  "What does that have to do with the case? Because he goes on trips and this makes his wife suspicious?" He asked knowing there was more to this.  "Because he seems to have left the same day of each disappearance, and she wants to know if he has something to do with these women." She told him and not wanting to have to go through with this with him, why couldn’t it have been anyone else but him?  "What ties does he have with any of these women?" he asked her as he sat back in his chair.  "I don’t know, I just started looking into it." She told him now sounding stupid.  He smiled sipping his coffee." You should investigate him not my case, when you know there is a connection come talk to me. " He said as he looked very serious at her with out a trace of a smile." But, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know if you want me to talk about the case." He smiled at her so smugly.  She sat back in her chair studying his face "There isn’t any use in me sitting here any longer, I can see this is not going anywhere." She told him feeling like crying from the aggravation when she realized she had to wait for him. Great! Just what I wanted to be stuck here with him with out any type of escape in sight! She thought as she sat back down. She sat silently then pulled herself together." Your right I should have seen if he was connected to them first, but I thought by seeing what connections the police may have found it might have linked back to him ." She said humbly hoping it worked and he would talk to her.  "What is his name?" he asked as he ran his finger around the rim of his coffee.  "I am not ready to tell you since it may be nothing." she explained to him.  "But you want me to talk and tell you what we have?" he asked irritated.  "I am sorry, but if you go to him he will know someone pointed a finger at him and he’ll suspect it was his wife." she tried to explain to him why she did not want to tell him too much.  Roger sat for a moment as he realized he could have her work with him on this , it would mean being together until he got what he wanted, her.   "I have an offer since we both know each other and we both want to find out what is going on and who the responsible party is, you will have to work with me though ." he told her as he watched her reaction to his proposal.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne looked at her shaking hands in her lap "Alright you have a deal." She told him not looking at him. She would work with him until she had her answer, besides Hank will be home soon, she thought to herself, it will be ok. She tried hard to reassure herself.    That night as Ralph and Cheyenne sat on the front porch they watched the car lights that came up the drive way, Ralph wagged his tail as Roger walked up to the porch, Cheyenne looked at Ralph. "You are a dumb dog." Cheyenne said standing up to greet him as he came up the steps.  " Hi Roger, would you like some coffee?" she asked trying very hard to be polite to him and fighting the pain of the old wounds that had not healed from their relationship.  He smiled at Cheyenne and patted Ralph on the head.  " Thank you that sounds good." He said thinking to him self how she still looked great even in an over sized gray sweat shirt and jeans without shoes just socks." I feel over dressed now that I see how comfortable you look." He said following her into the house.  "I’ll fix the coffee, Sit down at the dinning room table that will probably be best for us to use." She said as she pointed at the rustic table with a white table cloth, the chairs were wooded high backs with white cushions that tied to the back of the chair.  As they sat for an hour going over each others notes Cheyenne looked at the window as she saw lightening streak through the sky." Looks as if a storm is brewing out there." She said as she placed her chin on her fist as she read the papers. "These women just vanished? God what is he doing with them?" she looked at Roger knowing in her heart they had to be dead.  "All we know is he strikes every three weeks and this is the third week." He said sipping his coffee.  Cheyenne read the notes and quickly went to the kitchen grabbing her calendar looking at each month and date the women disappeared." They all disappeared on the third Thursday and tomorrow is Thursday Roger." Her eyes were showing panic as she realized tomorrow another woman would disappear.  "We know, we have set up more security around the shopping centers and parking areas." he said as he swallowed the cookie he was eating.  The phone rang Cheyenne knew it would be Hank calling in since in another hour he would have to call Mrs. Harrelson. Cheyenne picked Up the phone smiling.  "Hello baby!" her voice was so cheerful even though she missed him so much. "Have you heard anything?" she asked him as she played with the hem of her sweat shirt.  Roger tried to concentrate on the papers in front of him but he couldn’t, it still hurt to hear her saying I love you and I miss you to someone else. He clinched his fist for he knew he was the one who screwed up the relationship not her. Damn if she only knew how sorry I was. He thought to himself. He heard his name mentioned in their conversation looking up at Cheyenne.  "He is only here so we can work on this case with out me having to reveal our client at this time." Her voice was agitated as she spoke to Hank. "Well you’re going to have to trust me, even if you don’t trust him Hank." Cheyenne looked at the floor as she played with the phone cord." I love you too baby, good night & sweet dreams."   Those words tore through Rogers heart, he looked away to hide the tears. "I need to use your rest room." He said as he quickly got up from the table.  "It’s down the hall way to your right." Cheyenne pointed in the direction of the rest room she sensed a change in his attitude.  Cheyenne watched the lightening dance across the sky from the window she noticed the wind was blowing stronger; the lights started flickering in the house great we are going to lose the electric she thought. Ralph sat next to Cheyenne." Its ok boy." She said patting him.   Roger came down the hall way the lights went out." Hope you have candles or a flash light." He said as he made his way back to the table.  "Both as luck would have it." She told him as she felt her way into the kitchen.  She lit the candlewick watching the trees bending in the wind, damn this is a bad storm hitting us, she thought as she grabbed the portable radio. She walked back out to Roger sitting at the table. "Ah light." He said with a smile.  "This storm is bad Roger I think we should listen to the radio. "She said as she sat back down at the table.  "At least we’re inside instead of being caught outside in it." He said as the thunder began to shake the windows.  They looked at the radio as the DJ came on with a storm warning.  " We are asking everyone to seek cover we are in a severe thunder storm with sightings of three tornados, it’s expected to last until three am." The DJ reported over the radio.  Roger and Cheyenne looked at each other knowing they would be spending the duration of the night together in the same house.  "You can sleep in the guest room tonight." She said feeling strange knowing he would be under the same roof with her.  "Thank you, but if it will be a problem I can try to make it home." He told her knowing she would not send him out into the storm.  "Don’t be silly, we’re two adults and should be able to stay under the same roof." She told him as the strange feeling grew stronger with each word. "I hope Hank tells me that Mr. Harrelson went on his trips on different days then when the women disappeared." She said trying to change the subject.  "Has he found out anything from the trip?" Roger asked as he watched Cheyenne in the candle light, she looks so angelic, he thought to himself.  "Yes on each trip Mr. Harrelson was accompanied by a woman, but the clerk couldn’t be sure if it was any of the women in the news paper clippings that Hank showed him." She told him.  He smiled to him self. "When he calls back tell him I will fax over a better photo of the victims." He told her knowing this would be a stall tactic to keep Hank away for a little longer.  "Alright I will tell him when he calls back." She told him knowing that Hank would be calling her back since he knew Roger was there with her. "What about tomorrow? He is going to strike again you know." She told him looking scared.  "We’ve done all we can do Cheyenne, increasing security is the best we could do, besides hoping and praying that your guy will be ID so we can nail him before he strikes again." He told her, he felt helpless in preventing the abduction from taking place.  Roger watched Cheyenne twirling her hair in her fingers as she sat at the table with her feet up in the chair and one arm wrapped around her legs watching the lightening light up the sky, the song came on she will leave you smiling by George Straight. She sure will, he thought as he watched her as they sat in silence.  Hank finally called back with out any new information from Mrs. Harrelson, she couldn’t be sure if it was Thursday when Mr. Harrelson went on his trips, she just knew it was around the same time of the month. This made sense to Roger since he could have abducted them and left the next day.  "Cheyenne this could have been our house if you hadn’t left me." He said taking a deep breath.  Cheyenne laughed." Oh please! You were to busy being the big player then being into a commitment! I was not the only woman in our relationship and you didn’t even try to hide them! That is how arrogant you are! "She said trying not to lose her cool completely with him.  "You must still have feelings for me Cheyenne, because you’re still so angry at me." He said smugly.  "No woman likes to be made a fool of and treated like yesterdays left over." She said sitting straight up with her feet now on the floor.  "You were always first with me; I never took the other ones around my friends." He told her sounding so serious.  Cheyenne looked at him with a look of pity." You really believe that bull**** your running through your head don’t you?" she asked him as she could almost see a child like quality inside of him." I am going to go to bed now. " She said as she turned to go to her room.  The storm was getting worse as Cheyenne laid in her bed watching how it lit up the entire room with its brilliant flashes until she fell into a deep sleep.  Roger tossed and turned all night knowing that she was in the same house, and not in his arms. If I could only do it all over again I would still have her. He thought to him self. Roger drifted off to sleep when Ralph jumped up on the bed next to him. Roger looked at the dog.  " Don’t hog the covers, and no snoring or you’re gone." He said putting his arm around Ralph.  Hank lay in his hotel room bed with thoughts of Cheyenne and the love they have together. He wondered how she was sleeping alone without him beside her, or was Roger sleeping in their bed with her. He looked at the clock it was two o’clock in the morning, he smashed the bottle of beer next to his bed and rolled over.   Cheyenne was awakened the next morning by Ralph’s barking outside the house, she sleepily got out of bed to look out the window to see what the commotion was all about. Looking out the window she saw Ralph barking at Roger as he chopped up the fallen tree from the night before. "How nice of him, but it won’t work Roger." She said to herself as she watched him stack the tree up neatly by the road for the sanitation department to remove it.  She decided to jump in the shower while he was busy outside. She stepped into the hot shower water; it felt so refreshing to her. she hated it when she had to step out of the shower, she put on her long white terry cloth robe, wrapped her hair in a white towel, she walked to her closet where she picked out a long blue jean skirt that rested on her hips, with a wide black suede belt with long fringe hanging from each end, a purple and black peasant shirt that hung off her shoulders slightly with suede black boots that were just below her knee. She wore her blond hair down with just the sides pulled up. She looked at herself in the mirror pleased with her outfit. "Not bad for a forty five year old woman." She said going to the kitchen where she found fresh made coffee, and a piece of breakfast cake waiting for her at the table with a white rose and note which had written, I am sorry for last night Cheyenne. A smile actually came to her face as she softly touched the flower with her finger tips.  Cheyenne began her morning with a cup of coffee, she smiled with a slight chuckle" You’re only sorry Roger because you didn’t get me in the bed with you ." She said as she sat at the kitchen table when she heard the front door shut knowing it must be Ralph and Roger coming in.  " Good morning Cheyenne." Roger said as he and Ralph came into the kitchen. "We are going to have to go by my place so I can shower and change." He told her as he sat at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee.  "I will just meet you at the station Roger." She said as she sipped her coffee.  "That is impossible since your car also had a tree sitting on it." He told her pouring some more coffee into his cup.  "No, not my car, you’re kidding right?" She asked as she searched his face for some kind of a sign saying it was all a joke.  "Your car Cheyenne, so you better call your insurance company." He told her sipping on his coffee.  Cheyenne got up from the table "Damn it!" she said as she ran out of the house to check on her car. She could not believe it when she saw it the tree was sitting on top of her car just as he said it was.  "Why didn’t we get two cars when we were going to?" She said looking at the car.   "We need to get going Cheyenne if we are going to try and stop this guy today." Roger told her.  "Ok let’s go." She said as they walked to his car.  They pulled in front of his house, she noticed nothing had changed; it still looked the same as when she was last there. The little boy statue still stood in the front yard with the lantern; she always thought it was precious. He still had the brown leather sofa and matching love seat, the glass coffee table with matching end tables, the large black television that took up a whole wall it self. On the wall still hung the plaque with the love poem she had given him on the last Valentines Day they were together.   "You know where everything is Cheyenne make your self at home while I get ready." He told her as he walked down the hall way to his room.  Cheyenne picked up a sportsman magazine and read it as Roger showered.  Roger appeared in the living room. Cheyenne noticed he was wearing blue jeans, a burgundy pull over shirt, with white sneakers. Cheyenne smiled at him. "You are dressed casual?" she asked as they were leaving the house.  "I recall the last time we were together I ended up ruining an expensive suit." He told her as he locked the front door.  Once inside the car Cheyenne looked seriously at Roger. "It is not my fault that you decided to take a balloon filled with food coloring that was intended for me." She told him turning her head to look out the window smiling as she recalled the incident.  "Well next time someone points an object that resembles a gun at you remind me not to protect you." he told her feeling agitated with her.  She tried to hold in her laughter." You are such a male chauvinist pig! I am quite capable of taking care of myself buddy." She said wanting to burst out in laughter.  "As long as your sister does not have some guy out to with balloons to hit you with." He told her as he backed up the car.  "It was a joke and she didn’t know we were going to a charity ball either." She said looking at him as he drove down the road.  Most of the ride to the police station was in silence, Cheyenne could not resist to pick on him more." You were really pist off." She said as she looked out the window.   "Your getting quite a kick out of this memory lane you’re having aren’t you Cheyenne?" he asked her finally smiling.  "Yes I am as a matter of fact, because your expression was priceless." She said tauntingly.  "Glad I could be of service in making you laugh Cheyenne." He said as he pulled into the parking space.  Once inside of his office Roger faxed over the photos he had for Hank. Cheyenne sat quietly looking out the office window over looking the front of the station with the marble pond where people were sitting on the edge talking or smoking cigarettes. Cheyenne looked around his office so immaculate, even his black desk had every piece of paper in order; she looked at the picture of his daughter sitting in front of the chair so he could see her as he sat at the desk. She died so young, just 17, first day driving and out of nowhere a drunk driver struck the car killing his daughter instantly. What a shame Cheyenne thought to herself.  "Ready to go see Mrs. Harrelson?" he asked as he picked up some more files.  "Yes I am ready." Cheyenne said as she walked out of the office.  They both were quiet as they drove to the Harrelson’s house; Cheyenne prayed they would find a connection to stop one more woman from being abducted today.   Roger looked at Cheyenne as they pulled in front of the house." Well let’s see what we learn here today." He said as he almost felt helpless to catching whoever was behind these abductions.  Cheyenne felt nervous it was the same feeling she had the last time she was here, as if there were eyes watching them. She noticed that Roger had his hand on his gun in its holster. Probably just habit, she thought to herself.  The door opened with the little old woman standing there looking surprised to see them there." Mrs. Harrelson is not expecting any guest today." She said in her soft voice.  "We know she isn’t, I am Detective O’berst and I wish to speak with her now." His voice was cool as he looked into the woman’s eyes.  "Come in detective and Mrs. Thompson I will tell Mrs. Harrelson you are here." Her voice sounded irritated.  "I think we hit a nerve with her." Roger said as he watched the woman go into the den.  A few moments later she came back to where they were standing." She will receive you now." She told them leading them to the den.  She’s a female Lurch. Cheyenne thought as they walked down the hall. Once inside Mrs. Harrelson sat behind the desk wearing a green satin robe with a matching gown. Green must be her favorite color, Cheyenne thought to herself remembering she had on an emerald green dress on the last time she and Hank were there.  "How can I help you two today?" She asked in weakened voice." You will have to excuse me I am not well." She said rubbing her fore head with her finger tips.  "We need to ask some question’s about your husband." Roger told her sitting in one of the chairs in front of the desk. "Besides the fact that your husband seems to be gone on the same day as the women have been abducted what makes you think he is involved?" Roger noticed her hands shaking as she lit up a cigarette.  "Because when I started to suspect him I would think a woman would show up missing on the day he left and they did. I can not say I have seen him do it with my own eyes because I haven’t detective, but I know he is flying out to Dallas today at six pm and I know in my heart a woman will come up missing." Her eyes had tears in them as she spoke.  "What plane will he be taking?" Roger asked as he couldn’t help notice how beautiful she looked.  "I don’t know he never tells me, I over heard him making his reservations for today." She told him as she forced a smile.  "May I see his comb or brush something that would have his prints on it?" he asked her smiling. "I need to see if his finger print matches with what we have." He said looking at this gorgeous creature sitting in front of him.  Cheyenne seeing him putting on his charm accidentally kicked him in the shin. "I am so sorry Roger." She said smiling secretly to her self.  Roger rubbed his leg. "No harm done Cheyenne." He told her looking at her strangely.  Mrs. Harrelson called for her house keeper on the intercom.  " Aggatha please bring me Mr. Harrelson’s brush & comb set without touching it, use something not to remove any prints." She smiled trying to conceal her pain. "I hope this puts the end to the abductions, plus the end to the nagging question going through my head." She told them rubbing her brow with her finger tips.  When the woman came in with the brush and comb she handed them to Roger using prongs and placing them in a bag." Your sure no one but him has touched these?" he asked the elderly woman.  "No one except for Mr. Harrelson uses this set detective." She told him then stepped away from him.  Roger placed the bag he had in his pocket. "I will be in contact with you as soon as we know the results." He told the woman as he stood up to leave.  "Thank you detective." Mrs. Harrelson told him as they were leaving.  Roger rushed back to the station to have the hair samples tested. "If we get a match then all we have to do is meet him before the plane leaves at six tonight." he told Cheyenne who closed her eyes most of the ride.  Once inside the station he had Cheyenne to wait in his office while he went to have the prints ran, normally it could take up to eight hours but he placed a rush on it. She wished Hank would return soon she hated it when they were apart. She waited what seemed to be an hour before he returned. "We got a match. There’s been an APB issued for him, it’s just a matter of time now." He told her in an ecstatic voice.  "I hope they pick him up before he gets another woman." She said looking at her watch." In four hours he is suppose to be leaving."   "You know one thing I was relieved about through all of this? Is that you are a blonde and not a brunette." He said sitting on the corner of the desk top.  She flashed him an ear to ear grin." Yes I am very grateful to Miss. Clairol in a bottle." She told him with a smile so bright it made her look younger then forty five years old. "Well I guess all we can do now is just pray and hope he gets picked up." She told him looking so lost and sad like a small child.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings ©  Roger looked at her wanting to protect her. "I will take you home and then I will go wait at the air port for him to show up." He said standing up when the phone rang. " Hello Hank." Roger said into the receiver.  Cheyenne looked up as he spoke with her husband on the phone.  "We got a match on his prints today; he’s supposed to be flying out to Dallas at six this evening and we will be waiting for him there. No, yes I will be taking her home. Ok I will tell her." He said and hung up the phone.  "Tell me what?" she asked him trying to hide that she was upset that he didn’t ask to speak to her, Hank knew she was there.  "He said he loved you and he will call you when he arrives in Dallas." He told her seeing it upset her that Hank did not speak to her himself.  "Ok, well I am ready to go home." she said forcing a smile as she stood up. "Why is he going to Dallas? She asked.   "We better go." Roger said trying to avoiding the question.  Cheyenne looked at Roger knowing he was keeping something from her, something that Hank told him on the phone. What? What are they keeping from me? She asked herself.    During the ride to the house Cheyenne was quiet as it kept bothering her he did not talk to her on the phone." Roger can you tell me why Hank would not want to talk to me on the phone?" she trusted him enough to at least tell her the truth since even in their relationship he never lied, not even about the other women.  "He said his plane was departing and he would call you when he got there." He told her as he could see it was an issue that really bothered her." Don’t worry Cheyenne, he is not me and would not cheat on you. I give him better brain cells then I have." He was trying to cheer her up.  She looked at him with a smile." Your right Roger, he does have more brain cells then you." Her smile grew across her face.  "Wow that hurt. You can be so cruel Cheyenne." He said holding his heart as if in pain.  As they drove up to the gate to the drive way Cheyenne noticed an old gray car." Wonder who that could be?" looking at the strange car parked in there.  "It looks like your best friend has come back to town to see you." Roger said pointing to Kimberly and her mother Norma sitting on the front porch.  "Son-of-a-bitch." Cheyenne said looking at the two women, they looked like they had been on the road for awhile." Wonder what they want this time?" her voice was irritated seeing them in front of her home.  Roger chuckled. "Money, a place to stay, you know the same old thing as before." Roger told her as he pulled up beside their car.  The two women quickly got to their feet when they saw Cheyenne and Roger. "Hi there!" they both yelled at the same time as they waved at them.  Kimberly was the first to greet Cheyenne." How have you been? I have really missed you!" she said hugging Cheyenne when she came out of the car.  "I’ll bet, what brings you two here?" she asked looking at Norma who was thin and bruised. "What happened to you?" She asked the woman seeing she had been beaten.  "Oh it’s nothing Cheyenne; I just made someone mad at me." She said glancing nervously in Kimberly’s direction as she wrung her hands together.  "Cheyenne I am pregnant without anywhere to stay. The dumb bitch lost our home we had." Kimberly told her angrily." Could we stay here until we find work?"  "I have to ask Hank Kimberly, He’s out of town right now."  "So why are you with Roger?" Kimberly asked smiling as if there was something going on between them.  "We’re working on a case together, I need to get going Cheyenne I will call you tonight." Roger said as he got back in his car.  "Nice to see you too Roger." Kimberly said watching him leave.  "Well let’s go inside." Cheyenne said as she led the way.  "Oh Cheyenne this place is so nice." Norma said as she looked around the place.   "Want some coffee?" Cheyenne asked the two women standing in her living room.  "Yes thank you Cheyenne." they said as they followed her into the kitchen.  "Cheyenne it will only be for three weeks I promise." Kimberly told her as she was almost in tears.  "I’ll be talking to Hank soon." She told her as she put the coffee on.  " You two can go shower it will make you feel better." she said looking at the women’s dirty feet on her clean floor. "Please wear socks when your inside." she said as she showed them the shower in the hall way near the guest room they’d be sharing.   As Cheyenne was making some ham and cheese sandwiches to eat with some vegetable soup she heard the two women yelling at each other." Better go check it out Ralph." She said patting the dogs head.  "I am not sharing this room with you, you dumb bitch! I hate you! God I wish you had died instead of dad!" Kimberly was screaming at Norma hysterically.  "What is going on in here?" Cheyenne asked as she swung open the door.  "I do not want to sleep in the same room as her Cheyenne, I hate her!" she told her and began to cry.  "Stop acting like this Kimberly, she either stays in here or neither one of you will stay here at all." Cheyenne told them both." Now let’s go eat."  "I don’t want to eat." Kimberly said with quivering lips.  "You’re pregnant and need some good food now come on." She told them.  When they sat down to eat Kimberly looked up at Cheyenne." I don’t like vegetable beef soup." She said holding her hand over her bowl.  Cheyenne smiled at her." Move your hand or I will pour the soup on it, the baby needs vegetables." Cheyenne told her as she held the soup ladle over her hand.  "Fine I’ll eat it." She said moving her hand.  As they sat at the table Cheyenne looked at Kimberly who was heavy and you really couldn’t see her pregnancy." How many months are you?" she asked looking at her belly.  "Six months." she said.  "Where is the father?" Cheyenne asked biting into her sandwich.  "He dumped me when he found out I was pregnant." She said as tears filled her eyes.  "I am sorry Kimberly, but you will be fine. "She said patting her hand on the table top.  Just then the phone rang it was Roger letting her know that Harrelson never showed up to catch the plane. Roger was having his men wait there in case he caught a later plane out that night and he was going to go back to the Harrelson’s house to see if by any chance he was there. After they hung up the phones she felt that same feeling like they were being watched a chill ran down her spine as she looked out the kitchen window.  "I think I will take a shower right now, if Hank calls bring the phone to me in the rest room Kimberly." She said as she looked at the woman sitting in front of her with stringy black hair, she had dark circles around her black eyes, her self esteem was very low about her self." Hey what if I trim up your hair when I am done?" Cheyenne knew it must be very scary to bring a child into the world but even more so without the father being with you.  Kimberly smiled" Thanks Cheyenne, I could use a hair cut." She said running her swollen fingers through her hair.  "Hey would you mind cutting mine too Cheyenne?" Norma asked fingering her mousy brown thin hair.  "The beauty shop will open when I come out of the shower ladies." Cheyenne said as she walked towards her bed room.  In the shower it felt great to feel the hot steamy water on her flesh, as she was shampooing her hair she thought she heard a thud on the bathroom floor." Anyone there?" she asked but she didn’t get a response from anyone. It wasn’t until she had rinsed her hair that someone banged on the bathroom window. Cheyenne turned the water off quickly, grabbing her robe from the hook in the rest room she yelled  " who’s out there?" again no response as she looked down at her feet was a large rat with its head decapitated and it blood running onto the floor. Cheyenne reeled backwards screaming then ran out of the bathroom into her bedroom just as the phone began to rang, the other women came running into her room.  "What’s wrong Cheyenne?" they asked together.  "Who put a fucking headless rat in my bathroom?" She screamed at the women.  "What are you talking about?" Kimberly asked and then went to look.  Cheyenne answered the phone "Hello?" It was Hank; he had made it to Dallas. Cheyenne was hysterical as she told him about the rat and the banging on the window. She hung up the phone." He said to lock all the windows and doors, Kimberly call the police." Cheyenne noticed her doors to the patio was slightly opened she ran to lock them.  Cheyenne put on a light blue shirt dress that fit tight against her body, with light blue sandals as she waited for the police to arrive.  Cheyenne joined the other women in the living room.  " Who could have put that rat in there?" She asked the other women.  The women shook their heads not having a clue as who could be so sick to do such a thing. There was a knock at the door." Please be the police." Kimberly said looking fearful at the door.  Cheyenne opened the door slowly seeing two uniformed officers standing there." Hello, thank you for coming so fast." She said opening the door up wider to let them in.  Cheyenne showed them the bathroom with the dead rat. "I was taking a shower when I heard a thud, after I was done and just getting out someone banged on my bathroom window. I found my patio doors a jarred." she said pointing to the doors in her bedroom.  Roger appeared in the doorway of the bedroom. "Cheyenne Hank asked me to come by to see what was going on here." He told her as he looked at the rat that the policeman had in a bag.  "I thought you were going to the Harrelson’s? How did Hank get a hold of you?" Cheyenne questioned him.  "He had the station to call me." He told her as he walked to the bathroom to look around he could still smell the shampoo and soap Cheyenne had used.  "Why would Hank ask you to come here to check on me?" she asked as this confused her that her husband would have her ex lover to come to her rescue.  "At each crime scene Cheyenne there had been a headless rat. I think he’s left a calling card here to let us know that he knows we’re onto him." He told her looking at her in her dress.  Cheyenne crossed her arms across her chest realizing she had not put on a bra." I am blonde! My hair is not brunette! I am a fucking blonde!" she told him as tears came to her eyes realizing this guy was just here inside of her home! He watched her take a shower!  "That’s why your still here Cheyenne." He told her seeing how afraid she was." I will stay here with you women tonight; Hank will be back tomorrow morning." he told her hoping it would ease the tension she was feeling.  The phone rang Roger answered it." Hello." He said as he looked at the three women standing together." Hank what the hell do you mean he is at the hotel? How long has he been there? Damn it how did he get through us? Is there anyone else with him? You’re in the room next to his? Good keep an eye on him if you can. Alright talk to you tomorrow. I will put her on the phone." Roger handed the phone to Cheyenne.  "Hello? Hank how could he be there and been here too? Ok baby I will. I love you and miss you." She hung up the phone. She looked at Roger. "What the hell is going on here? How could he be there? Hank said they both were checking in at the hotel." She looked so confused.  "He may not work alone Cheyenne." Roger said as he let the crime scene unit in to do their work." You ladies go sit in the kitchen while we try to get prints." Roger told them and went outside to see if he could find any tracks. He wondered how the person or persons had gotten past Ralph who was next to Cheyenne in the kitchen.  As Roger came up to the patio off of Cheyenne’s room he saw a dog food can with half a can of food still in it. Roger knew then Ralph had been fed to be distracted. Using his pen he brought the can into the room to be checked for prints and toxins. It would not surprise him if the perpetrator or perpetrator's poisoned the dog to get him permanently out of the way. Roger and the other officer checked the outside premises and would resume in the morning when they had better lighting. Roger stood on the patio looking into the night and felt as if someone was watching him.    That evening as they all sat around the living room Cheyenne sat close to Roger, he knew she was scared. "I don’t want Cheyenne alone in her room tonight so one of you ladies will be her room mate." He told them.  Cheyenne sat straight up on the couch. "Like hell! I am sleeping right out here with you detective." She told him looking like a scared child afraid of the boogie man. "I will put pallets on the floor next to the couch where you will be sleeping." She said then got up to make her bed. "Come with me Norma." She said looking scared into her dark bedroom.  "Hey I think we all should sleep in the same room tonight." Norma said to Cheyenne and Roger.  "That might be a good idea Norma." Cheyenne said as they went to gather up blankets and the air bed to lie on.  Cheyenne changed into a pair of gray sweat pants and a loose fitting black t shirt. She lay on the side of the couch near Roger who slept in his slacks without a shirt. Norma slept between Cheyenne and Kimberly. After Cheyenne had fallen to sleep Roger laid his hand on her shoulder watching her face as he fell into a deep sleep. A few hours had passed as they slept when Roger felt Cheyenne’s soft lips kissing his lip’s she was laying on top of him on the couch. "I want you." she whispered into his ear. His hands were moving up and down her body slowly as she licked his neck slowly. He began to kiss her passionately holding the back of her head with his hand when he was jolted upright by Cheyenne’s blood curdling scream from the air bed. "Cheyenne what’s wrong?" he asked moving down to the air bed and taking her into his arms as he realized he had been dreaming.  "I thought I saw the rat in the bed with me!" she cried as she realized it was a nightmare.  "God you scared me! I guess I look like a rat in the dark." Norma said trying to make Cheyenne laugh.  "I have to go piss now." Kimberly said getting up to go to the rest room. "I think you scared it out of me." She said staggering to the rest room.  "Your ok Cheyenne nothing is going to harm you." Roger said holding her close to him as he could feel her heart beating fast and hard against his own chest.  "I am sorry I hate rats." She said as she pulled away from Roger slowly. " Headless ones especially." She shuddered as Roger sat back on the couch; she began to laugh realizing she must have scared everyone in the room, even Ralph sat at the foot of the bed looking around the room.  "Well let’s try to get back to sleep then." Kimberly said as she came back to bed.  What a great dream I was having too. Roger thought to himself as he lay back on the couch looking down at Cheyenne lying next to him on the air bed.  At four in the morning the phone rang, Cheyenne hurried to her feet to answer it, her heart pounding thinking the worse when the phone rings in the middle of the night. "Hello?" Cheyenne switched to the speaker phone so Roger could hear the person on the other end.  "Cheyenne I wanted to tell you that tonight when you were in the shower, I stood next to the shower door watching you wash those nice rounded breast that are shaped like melons. You really turned me on, I have been thinking of how I am going to fuck you up that plump round ass you have." He told her as his breathing was becoming heavier as he spoke to her." I am going to force you on your knees and ram my thick hard shaft deep into you Cheyenne!" his breathing was getting heavier as he spoke." going in your ass deeper, and harder, harder, harder oh Cheyenne!" for a few seconds there was silence." I will be back to visit when I can enjoy my orgasm with you in person Cheyenne." The speaker phone went dead.  Cheyenne looked at Roger." it was him! He is coming back for me!" she said panicked thinking of how close he was to her tonight in the shower that he could have made his phone sex a reality. Chills ran through her body.  Roger got on the phone to call Hank.  " Is that bastard still in his room? He just called here getting off on the phone making Cheyenne listen to his sex fantasy about her .Go check, I don’t know! Act like you’re a drunk trying to get into the wrong room. I will wait." He told him wanting this bastard more then ever after hearing what he wanted to do to her.  A few minutes past when Hank came back telling him he was there with company, a petite brunette who was not there against her will either since she opened the door in just a sheet.  The next morning Roger received a letter special delivered by an officer from his precinct. With a Polaroid picture of a woman tied down while a person covered in a hooded robe pour rat’s blood all over her body. He could see the woman screaming in the picture, the letter wrote with cut out letters from a news paper saying it will be worse for his girlfriend Cheyenne.  "Anything good?" she asked him as she handed him the hot cup.  "You could say that." He said smiling as he didn’t want her to catch on to what he had received from the sick bastard.   As Cheyenne showered he called one of the other detectives to track down the letter and where it originated from.  Cheyenne hurriedly showered as memories of last night flooded her mind, it was the first time she had ever felt scared of being in her home. Pull it together Cheyenne or you will become a victim instead of catching the jerk. She thought to her self as she rinsed the conditioner from her hair. She opened the glass door she looked down at the floor to see if any surprises were there for her. Good nothing there. She thought as she stepped out. She sat on her bed in her white robe with a white towel wrapped around her head, she heard voices in her living room, there was another man there besides Roger and it was not Hank. Who is here? She wondered as she cracked opened her door to see who the other man was. It’s Detective John Saunders. She thought to herself as she listened to what they were saying.  "The sick son of a bitch is taunting us by zeroing in on Cheyenne as a target." Roger said to Saunders.  Detective Saunders was a very tall man, blond curly hair, tanned with blue eyes that seemed to always sparkle. He stood with his hands on his hips as he looked at the floor." The mail came from the sixth victim Gloria Luchese home address; they are still looking into it." He said as he took a deep breath as he loosened the collar and tie on his white dress shirt, his black slacks looked as though they had just recently been pressed, his black dress shoes as though they were just shined.  "She was the latest victim and the picture was of the first victim. We have got to catch him." Roger said as he noticed Cheyenne’s door opened. "Cheyenne?" He walked to the door and opened it slowly when he saw Cheyenne sitting on her bed drying her hair with the towel. He closed the door slowly thinking she had not seen him.  What is going on? She thought as she tried not to breathe hard from racing to the bed so they would not know she was eaves dropping on them. Cheyenne put on a lavender tank top, blue jeans and white sneakers. I think I need to go to these women’s houses and see if perhaps there is some connection. As the men were talking in the kitchen Cheyenne went to Kimberly’s room.  " Come on you have to give me a ride." She said grabbing her by the arm.  "I am not dressed Cheyenne." She said still in her night gown.  "Grab a robe we have to go now and be quiet." She told her in a quiet voice so the men would not hear her.  "Damn it." She said slipping on her robe as she followed Cheyenne out to the car." This is crazy Cheyenne where are we going?’ she asked as they got into the car.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne remembered Roger saying the mail came from one of the victim’s home address "We’re going to go and see what we can find at Gloria Luchese house." She said as she saw her front door swing open and Roger running out of it." Hurry up and go!" she said as Kimberly was pulling out. "I forced you to go so don’t worry about getting into trouble ok!" Cheyenne told her with irritation in her voice. "Just drive there and drive fast before they grab anything like pen pal clubs or something where lonely females join to find men." She told her.  Kimberly was scared, but did not want to make Cheyenne mad at her; she would be totally alone if Cheyenne turned her back on her with the baby coming. Her family had disowned her and her mother, the woman that she blames for everything ever having gone wrong in her life right down to her causing her boyfriend for just leaving one day while she was at work. She was shaking all over her body as she drove down the long lonely road surrounded by trees on both side. She saw Roger’s car coming out of the drive way. "Shit Cheyenne! Roger just pulled out what do I do?" she said looking in the rear view mirror.  "Watch the road would be nice and floor it." Cheyenne said in a calm even toned voice.  "Which way do I go at the end of the street Cheyenne?" she asked in a nervous voice.  " Left and then go like your going to Wally’s house she only lived a few blocks away from him on tenth street." Cheyenne said as she watched Roger’s car trying to catch up from the passenger’s side window.  Once Kimberly turned left at the end of the street she quickly turned right and then into a drive way." I figured we would let him go by so we could get away." She said looking at Cheyenne with fear in her eyes.  "Smart thinking Kim I will give you a cookie when we get home." Cheyenne said trying to ease the tension Kimberly was feeling.  Kimberly laughed. "I saw it on a TV show last week." She said backing up once she saw Roger’s car going down the other road.  The two women pulled in front of Gloria Luchese home that she shared with her parents. They were both silent as they looked at the house.  Kimberly looked in the rear view to see if Roger was coming her heart was beating hard in her chest.  "You go; I will wait here for you." She said not wanting to get out of the car in her robe and gown.  "Bull shit! Come on your not taking off on me now, let’s go!" Cheyenne yelled at her  Cheyenne and Kimberly stood nervously at the front door as they looked around to see if Rodger was coming down the road." You look cute by the way in your night clothes." Cheyenne said with a smile.  "Your so funny Cheyenne, I could have sat in the car while you did this." Kimberly said in an almost whiney voice.  The door was opened by an elderly white hair woman standing there." May I help you?" she said looking at the two women standing at her door.  "Hello, my name is Cheyenne Thompson I am a private investigator working on your daughter’s case, I was wondering if I could look around her room?" Cheyenne told the woman as she was trying to cover her impatience.  "Nice to meet you Miss. Thompson, please come in and help your self the bedroom is down the hall, last door to the left." She said pointing to the room as she let the women in the house.  Cheyenne went to the room it was decorated in early American furniture with a canopy bed. A picture of her and her boyfriend, an old fashion phone from the fifties by her bed.  Cheyenne went through the woman’s mail to see if she could find anything when the phone began to ring, the woman had a private line to her room. Cheyenne picked up the phone saying nothing as she heard a man’s voice on the other end.  "Hello Cheyenne, I have been waiting for you."  Cheyenne looked weird at the phone wondering how they knew it was her. Kimberly saw fear in Cheyenne’s face.  "Who is this?" Cheyenne asked as her hand began to shake.  "You can not escape me Cheyenne, I am going to enjoy fucking you! I am going to add you to my collection." The voice said taunting Cheyenne.  "You’ll never get to me to fuck me or anything else." She told the faceless voice.  Cheyenne was feeling fear run through her body. "This is too freaky Kim." She said looking at her friend with her hand over the receiver.   "Hang up Cheyenne, let’s go now! Who ever it is knows we’re here!" Kimberly urged Cheyenne wanting to leave.  "I will kill you before you touch me in any way." Cheyenne yelled.  "Damn it lets go!" Kimberly said almost in tears.  "Tell your friend she will be included too since she is pregnant." The voice said in an eerie tone.  "Leave her and her unborn child out of this, or I’ll enjoying putting my 357 up your ass and pulling the trigger!" Cheyenne yelled as tears burned her eyes.  "That’s it I am out of here! Come on Cheyenne!" Kimberly cried as she pulled on Cheyenne’s arm.  "Cheyenne I ought to arrest you!" Roger’s voice boomed behind the two women who jumped from being startled by him. Cheyenne dropped the phone.  Roger picked up the phone receiver.   " What the hell?" he asked hearing the man on the other end of the phone.  "You are losing your hot little girlfriend detective." The voice said before hanging up on Roger.  . "How did he know you were here? Unless he saw you come into the house." He said bewildered with what was taking place. "Saunders you take Kimberly back in your car and have her car impounded so we don’t have to worry about any more sudden rides by these two. And Cheyenne is riding back with Me." he said placing his hand firmly on her shoulder.  Just then the phone began to shoot sparks and blew up. " What caused that to happen?" Roger asked looking at the phone.  "I think we need to have the houses on the block searched" Saunders said looking at Roger.  "Maybe we can get people to voluntarily to have the houses checked; it would be a lot quicker." Roger said pulling Cheyenne up by the arm." See what you can do Saunders."  Once Roger had Cheyenne safely in his car he turned towards her with anger all over his face." What the hell has gotten into you Cheyenne?" he yelled at her.  Cheyenne looked at him feeling like a teenager who had been caught skipping school." I am sorry Roger, but you have to realize its not you he’s coming for, it’s me! I want to find him before he does get me!" she yelled back at him.  "Well running away from me is not going to give you protection either Cheyenne!" he yelled at her as he pulled into the street." Just sit there and be quiet until we get back to the house!" he said feeling so angry he could have strangled her for her leaving as she did.  "Ok I will as long as you do!" she yelled feeling like she was being scolded by her father.  "Fine it’s a deal! We will both shut up for the ride!" He said fuming inside.  The ride back was very quiet and very tense. Cheyenne would look his way when she knew he was not looking at her. Cheyenne was beginning to calm down when they were half way home.  " I am sorry Roger for being irresponsible today." She said looking at her hands in her lap.  Roger took a deep breathe as he looked over at her." Its ok Cheyenne, I was just scared for you. I am sorry for yelling at you." He said patting her hands in her lap.  "You know Roger I am glad this has brought us to being friends now, I do respect you, and I do love you, but I am not in love with you as I was before." She said feeling like she needed to tell him this in case something happened to her and she may never have the chance to ever tell him as the tears fell from her eyes.  "We will always be friends and I do love you more then I have ever or will ever love any other woman. There is no woman for me if I can never have you, and I do know I never will, but I will always be here for you, Always Cheyenne I promise." he said seeing she was scared especially after today.  Cheyenne leaned over towards him kissing him lightly on his cheek. "I know Roger and I thank you." She told him.  When they pulled in the drive way of the house Cheyenne saw Hank sitting on the porch with Norma." Hanks back!" she said feeling so happy to see her husband.  Roger saw him as he stood up on the porch. Great he’s back. He thought wishing he wasn’t. "So he is back isn’t he?" he said trying to hide his feelings.  Cheyenne jumped out of the car when Roger parked, "Hank! Your home! Oh Hank I have missed you!" she said running and jumping into his arms, she wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck.  Roger looked away as Hank and Cheyenne covered each other in kisses. Why the fuck did he have to come back so soon? Roger thought feeling the jealousy build with in him." Excuse me Hank was Harrelson still in Dallas when you left?" he asked trying to draw Hanks attention from Cheyenne.  Hank placed Cheyenne on the ground." As a matter of fact he was on the same plane as I was this morning alone, the woman he was with saw him off at the airport and left by herself. Once back here I followed him to his office waited to see if he was staying which he did and came here when I saw your men had it under surveillance."  "Good work Hank, did you find anything out in Oregon or Dallas?" he asked Hank as he watched Cheyenne hug on Hank.  "As a matter of fact I did, the woman who I saw him with last night always accompanies him there at Dallas, and she matches the description of the woman seen with him in Oregon the only difference in descriptions with the women who have turned up missing is that they are not petite, the woman last night looked like she was five-foot and weighed about ninety-eight pounds. Other then that the hair and age range are the same." He said as he noticed Saunders car coming up the road.  "Saunders and I will set up here to help watch the wandering women here , lets see what you can get from Mrs. Harrelson she is not to receptive to me." Roger told Hank.  "That is a strange house there, I really don’t think this guy is involved, at least I don’t have anything to believe he is involved directly." Hank told Roger as Saunders parked his car.  "The prints matched with the ones we lifted from one of the crime scenes Hank, we got lucky when the guy got lazy." Roger told him.  "Saunders do you know if they got him at the office?" he asked as the man approached them.  "He got away without being detected." He told him as he felt agitated with this guy as he seems to slip through their fingers all the time.  "We need to get into his office and look around." Cheyenne said as she was thinking of an idea.  "I take it from your look on your face that you have some wild plan Cheyenne." Hank told his wife looking down at her as he held her in his arms.  Cheyenne pulled away from Hank. "I do, what if Norma and I went in as a cleaning crew at night and while she is cleaning she could watch out for anyone to come in so I could go through his files?" she told the three men standing around her.  "I don’t like the idea sending you in there Cheyenne since he has singled you out as the next victim." Roger told Cheyenne.  "Roger another woman has been listed as missing since last night at eight o’clock. She disappeared from the Roller rink waiting for kid sister to come out." Saunders told him as he stood with his hands on his hips looking out at the sky.  "Son of a bitch! Who is working with this bastard?!" he yelled feeling at a loss. "Did anyone leave or go to the house last night or any other time?" Roger asked him.  "Not to our knowledge no." he said knowing his partner was upset with this new turn in the case.  "Ok let’s get working on this to solve it." He said as he turned to Cheyenne." and I will see what can be done to get you in the place." Roger said as he walked to the house.  As the men worked together in the living room Cheyenne and Norma were in Cheyenne’s room picking out wigs to change their appearance. Cheyenne picked out a short blond wig for Norma, a pair of jean overalls and a white t shirt with white sneakers. For herself she chose a long black wig that she would pull back in a pony tail, eye glasses, a pair of white overalls and a blue t shirt with white sneakers.  Roger had found out the name of the Janitorial Company that handled the cleaning of the building Harrelson worked in and managed to get the women to be the cleaning crew for tonight. When he was handed another letter by Saunders sent to him, but this time it came from Cheyenne’s house.  Dear Detective O’berst,  Still trying to figure out how I am doing all of this? I do want to tell you I will take the utmost pleasure in killing you when the time comes. As I am going to take great pleasure in fucking your little married girlfriend Cheyenne, I will enjoy those firm rounded breast as I taste them as sweet melons.  Roger read the letter, he showed it to the other men." He is getting off sending us this shit. "He said as the two men stood around him reading the letter.  "Let’s hope we find out what we need so we can nail him and lock his ass away forever." Saunders said as he watched Kimberly stuffing her face with a ham and cheese sandwich as she washed it down with a bottle of soda.  " I think she is getting carried away with the eating for two." He said laughing.  "She gets any bigger she’ll need a crane to lift her out of here." Roger said as he looked at her going to the kitchen for chips.  "I hate to see my food bill with her here." Hank said as he watched her stuffing the chips in her mouth as she walked back to the couch to finish her soap opera as she ate her food.  That night Roger with Hank took Cheyenne and Norma to the van they would be using to go to clean the office in. Hank noticed even in her drab outfit Cheyenne still looked beautiful to him. He was scared of losing her to this creep that was stalking her now. "I hope this works." he told Roger as they followed the van driven by a plain clothes officer.  "I do too Hank, just keep your eyes open tonight." he said as they pulled in front of the building.  Cheyenne and Norma went inside where they found the cart of cleaning supplies in the janitor’s room. As they went through the building they came to Harrelson's office "well Norma here we are." Cheyenne said taking a deep breath as she looked at the door.  "Let’s go Cheyenne before I piss my pants from being so nervous." Norma told her looking around her as her heart was beating wildly.  Once inside Norma went through the garbage cans before dumping them, Cheyenne searched through the files looking for anything that could be of help when she found a file on a group of people." What is this I wonder?" she said taking the file out to read it. As she read each persons profile she quickly snapped a picture of it." We might have hit pay dirt Norma." She said snapping away.  "Cheyenne hurry someone is coming!" she said as she quickly turned on the vacuum cleaner.  "I am done." She said as she replaced the file back into the drawer grabbing the trash bag.  The door opened slowly as a large bald, black man wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants stuck his head in." Oh I thought you were the regular cleaning girls in here, I am Otis the security guard here." He said coming all the way into the room.  "No we’re just the replacements tonight; they should be back tomorrow night. Cheyenne told him noticing how tall he was. H e must be 7 ft tall, so muscular. Cheyenne thought to her self as she looked at him in his tight fitting clothes.  "Well I guess you could do the same for me, see I get benefits from the women who work here at night." He said smiling as he walked up to Cheyenne and taking off her glasses.  "I don’t know what benefits you get from them, but you’ll have to wait until tomorrow when they return." She said backing up.  He grabbed Cheyenne by the arm." No I don’t think you understand, you are what I am getting tonight, now tell your friend to sit down unless she wants to suck on the barrel of my gun." He said running the gun across Cheyenne’s lips softly.  Cheyenne smiled at him "sit down Norma just do as he says." She slowly and sensually licked the barrel of his gun shaft; Cheyenne smiled looking him in the eyes." You really don’t want to do this Otis." She said trying to reason with him.  "I think I will decide what I want to do, and you will just do it." He said in a menacing voice, bending to kiss her lips, pulling her body against his that was rock hard, he had an erection against her pelvic.  Cheyenne pulled away from him. "I don’t want to upset you, but if you persist in trying to molest me I am going to have to kick your ass." She told him still smiling.  Otis began laughing. "Oh really your going to kick my ass are you?" he said holding her tighter as she felt his erection up against her body taking her hand making her touch it. "That’s all for you. Now remove your clothes so I can enter your hot body." He said rubbing her hand on his erection. "don’t want to take your clothes off get on your knees and let me choke you as you suck it." He said biting his bottom lip rubbing her hand on his erection harder, "I want to **** you bitch!" He said grabbing her grinding her hips against him.  "Ok I am tired of you now." She said as she quickly knocked the gun out of his hand with her other hand and began to punch him in his throat and chest. Cheyenne did not stop kicking and punching the large man.   Otis was having trouble breathing after Cheyenne’s direct punch to his Adams apple. Cheyenne was a black belt in karate and she kept up her attack on him until he fell to the floor." Stop, please stop." Otis cried out in pain.  Cheyenne knelt down next to him." I told you I didn’t want to do it didn’t I? She told him in a taunting voice. "Now we are going to leave while you just lay there like a good boy ok?" she told him as she flicked him the back of his head.  "Ok just leave me alone." He said as he lay on his stomach.  As the two women were leaving the office Cheyenne looked back at him." Oh by the way Otis, have a nice night." She said going out the door.  The women hurried outside to the waiting van where they told the officer waiting for them of Otis. "I will radio Roger and inform him." He said as he got on the radio with Roger. "Cheyenne said the security guard just tried to attack her up in the office he is still there."  "Have someone pick him up." Roger said." Are they ok?"  The officer laughed." yeah but from what she says he isn’t."  Roger laughed." Cheyenne got him good." Roger said over the radio. "Take them back to the house we will meet you there." Roger instructed the officer as he planned to pay the security guard a visit. "Let’s go up and see if he knows anything."  "Let’s go and do it then." Hank told Roger getting out of the car. The two men went to the office where the guard was still laying in pain. Roger walked over to him "Get up." he ordered the man.  "Who the fuck are you?" Otis groaned in pain.  "I am Detective O’berst and you just tried to assault two women in here." He said as he watched the man trying to get to his feet.  "That broad is crazy man, she assaulted me!" He said disgustedly.  Hank stood looking at the man who had just tried to assault his wife." you tried to assault her and your pride got bruised when she kicked you senseless." Hank said feeling rage build with in him.  "I never touched her in anyway what so ever!" Otis yelled.  Roger smiled as he loosened his burgundy tie. "well we know someone here is responsible for six missing women , we get a complaint that you just tried to force your self on a woman, I think you might be who we are looking for." Roger said hoping this would shake him up to start talking." We are hauling you in for questioning and possibly charges of false imprisonment of two females." Roger began playing his hand.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings ©  "Wait a minute man! I had nothing to do with no female or females disappearing, and how in the hell could anyone hold that crazed bitch against her will? She is a reincarnated female Bruce Lee." He said rubbing his throat.  The door opened with Sheriffs standing there." You need this guy taken in detective?" the younger officer asked.  "Yes I do for questioning of the women who have been abducted." Roger told the men." I will meet you there." Roger said as he and Hank left.  "Man you aren’t right, I never abducted any woman." He said as the officer placed him in hand cuffs.  Hank and Roger went to the station to see what they could get out of Otis. Cheyenne and Norma arrived back at the house to be greeted by Saunders." How did it go tonight?" he asked sitting in the rocking chair on the porch.  "Well besides Cheyenne beating up some huge black man tonight, good." Norma said as she sat on the step of the porch.  Saunders was smiling at Cheyenne.  " Bully, what happened?" He asked teasingly.  "The security guard evidently has an arrangement where he has sex with the cleaning crew, and he would not take no for an answer, so I just had to show him who was in charge of the situation." She said laughingly.  "You should have taken your friend; she could have eaten her way out. She has not stopped yet. I was going to grab a sandwich, but I was afraid of having to wrestle her to the ground for it." He said as he looked in the window pointing at Kimberly.  Norma looked famish rubbing her stomach." God I hope there is something left, all that excitement has made me hungry." Norma said with a smile." That is if it is alright with you Cheyenne if I get something." Norma said not wanting to be any more of a bother then her and her daughter were by staying there.  "Norma please stop being so goofy, let’s go in and whip up something to eat." She told the other woman.  " Come on Saunders that includes your help too." She said pulling him up from the chair.  As the three of them whipped up cheese burgers, Cole slaw, baked beans, corn on the cob for everyone to feast on. Saunders looked at Cheyenne "You know I was sorry when you and Roger broke up, are you really happy now?" he asked as he diced onions for the baked beans.  "Yes I am, very much, I am glad though that Roger and I have a better relationship now as friends." She told him flipping the burgers.  "He really did love you Cheyenne, and I think he still does." He said mixing in the onions to the beans.  "I will always have a special spot in my heart for him, but I have a good man that I will never leave for any reason." She told him flipping the burgers.  Kimberly came into the kitchen to join everyone." God that smells great I can’t wait to eat." She said looking at the food cooking.  "Damn it woman! do you ever stop eating?" Saunders asked her as he looked at her with disgust.   "When she is sleeping, well maybe she does." Cheyenne said teasing Kimberly.  "Go to hell Cheyenne I am pregnant." She whined as she put a grape in her mouth.  "What was your excuse before the pregnancy Kim?" she asked as she saw how mad she was getting.  "You’re just so funny." Kimberly said as she flung a grape at Cheyenne.  Norma looked at Kimberly "I guess we could have her clothes made at Omar’s the tent maker." She said trying to join in on the fun.  Kimberly walked over to her mother slapping her across the face as hard as she could." You fucking bitch, I will kick your ass again!" she screamed at Norma like a crazy woman.  Cheyenne ran to the women and stood between them." Look Kimberly you will not treat her like this! Not in my home!" she told her in a firm voice." Are you ok Norma?" she asked looking at the red welt on her face.  Kimberly looked hatefully at her mother." I am sorry Cheyenne, I lost my cool." She said sitting down at the kitchen table.  Hank and Roger finally arrived back at the house about an hour later just in time for dinner. After dinner they sat outside on the porch where Cheyenne’s black cat jumped up on her lap." And where have you been Ninja?" she asked petting his head as the cat purred loudly as he got comfortable on top of her lap.  They all sat on the porch Norma looked at Roger looking at the sky as the stars sparkled brightly. "Beautiful night." She said trying to start a conversation with him.  "Yes it is, but it feels weird tonight." He said still looking at the sky.  Cheyenne could see the sun rising bringing her out of her deep thoughts of the past and she knew she had to go on without her beloved Roger by her side or in her arms.  That week the women were planning for the wedding that one of the high council would perform the ceremony. The mansion sparkled with glittering beautiful flowers of purples; the gazebo richly decorated with roses that glittered, the ceremony would start at midnight.  Cheyenne and Lindsey traveled all over the world to find the perfect wedding dresses with the six other witches while Roger took the men across the country finding the perfect tuxedos. The men found white tuxedos, with black sashes and bow ties, ruffled shirts with white shoes.  Cheyenne and Lindsey agreed on long tight fitting white satin gowns, that had plunging v neck lines, opened backs, the sleeves long and made out of lace, the veils long with a piece that covered their face , they choose diamond necklaces, and white heels. Under the gowns, they would wear white corsets with matching bustiers, white thigh high lace nylons.  Wednesday was the bachelor party, Roger arranged for female strippers to be there to liven up the party they would be having in Miami Beach Florida in a hotel. Tammy over heard his phone call as well as the location of the hotel after he left the room she hit redial canceled his six female strippers then quickly went to tell Cheyenne what she had done and what they were going to do.  That night the men were in the hotel room drinking while they waited for their sexy hot little blond bimbo’s. Cheyenne and the seven other witches created five of the heaviest, ugliest female strippers that showed up wearing long Jackets to cover their thongs and one very heavy female dominatrix dressed in all black leather and tight fitting vest, leather thongs with matching garter belt holding up fish net stockings with black spiked heels and she was for Roger. After all, it was going to be his surprise for the men; the women turned his surprise around on him. Cheyenne told the woman she created for Roger." make sure you make him enjoy being a bad boy, he will need to be spanked a few times. Then I think you should make him tell you that all women are his leaders and he will always obey. Make him lick and suck on your toes too." Cheyenne told her then busted out into laughter a long with the other witches. She cast a spell on the men so they would be without their powers while they were in the room with the women, but it would return once they escaped.  The women arranged it so they could have a home theater to watch what happens in the comfort of their living room. Cheyenne even arranged to tape it so they could watch it when they needed a good laugh. The men had left for the bachelor party. They each wore casual attire thinking they were going to a few bars. Cheyenne and all the women of the house sat in front of the large screen with their pop corn and soda.  The men arrived at the hotel where the other two looked around the room." Roger what are you up too?" Hank asked thinking they were going to a bar.  "I ordered the hottest sexiest 6 strippers to come here, two for each of us." He told the men who looked at him disbelief.  "I am not staying here, Cheyenne finds out and we’re over with." He told him turning to leave.  "It’s expected to sow your oats at your bachelor party." He told them.  "You get us killed by Cheyenne and Lindsey we are going to make you regret it." Saunders said rubbing his hands together.  There was a knock at the door, Roger had a huge smile on his face when he opened it the big dominatrix woman. His face turned to pure shock as he looked at her wondering what was going on.  "Are you Roger?" she asked him.  "Yes why?" he asked the huge woman.  "You ordered us! Move out of my way you naughty boy!" She ordered him. She shoved him back into the room and the other five women came in removing their jackets then grabbed the men.  The women were laughing as they watched the fear on Rogers face as the woman grabbed him putting him over her knees." Bad, bad boy!" she yelled spanking him with a leather strap.  Hank was grabbed by three of the strippers.  " you like it rough; we will take turns being on top of you. "They said pushing him on the bed. The women jumped on the bed covering him in kisses and pulling at his clothes while he yelled for help. He tried to get away by using his magic only to find out it did not work. "oh my God!" he said as the one that had to weigh four hundred pounds sat on top of him forcing his hands on her ass." I am going to give it to you good and hard." She told him as she grinded her body on his. She kissed him as the others removed his pants Hank fought to get away.  Saunders as well was being attacked by the other two heavy women as one held him down and the other pulled his pants off. The one straddling him looked down at him smiling. "You better get it up.," she told him as she licked his face. He too found out his magic was gone as well as Roger as he was being spanked as he yelled out in fear. "Cheyenne! Help me!" he yelled out with each spank from the strap.  The eight witches were in tears as they laughed so hard watching the men struggle to get away from the six hot babes. "Teaches them right." Norma said as she laughed at the men’s plight.  Finally Saunders was able to get away to help Hank then they saved Roger just as he was going to have to suck and lick the woman’s toes.   "That’s what you call hot strippers?" Saunders asked as they ran out the door.  Once the men ran out of the room the eight witches then changed into dresses that hardly covered their nipples and they didn’t need to bend over to show their ass’s as they went to the patio where they had ten of the most handsome, hottest male strippers one for each woman including Aggatha and Norma. They made each of them very well endowed.  "Damn look at that." Cheyenne said as she looked at one of them who had been extremely gifted by the witches. "I mean damn look at him, I want him." She said not taking her eyes off of his gift smiling." To make Hank jealous is what I meant, not that I would even consider riding that thang!" she said jumping up in his arms and grinding while she laughed. She looked into his blue eyes, black curly hair and a body that could only come from over sexed witches. "Ooh talented too." She said smiling as he made his gift move against her crotch.  "Let’s get in our places on the patio incase they realize they have powers and pop back in here." Lindsey told them as she picked the blond, blue eyed one then smacking his ass in his blue thong.  The men popped into the house to see these men in just thongs pushing their male organs in the women’s faces. The women were going crazy screaming. They stood there watching with their arms crossed.  Cheyenne who was sitting in a patio chair as the man with the great gift laid it between her cleavage, still wearing his thong making it do push up’s, she had her hands on his ass.  The men walked out on the patio even Aggatha and Norma were acting like animals they could not believe it." Are you ladies having fun?" Roger asked rubbing his buttocks that still stung from his spanking.  "Why are you back here?" the women asked angrily .  " Aren’t you supposed to be doing bachelor things?" Cheyenne asked them trying not to laugh as the man was still over her.  "Well just say it didn’t work and get rid of these guys will you?" Hank asked looking at the guy with the gift getting upset.  "Fine." They said making them disappear.  The happy now that they ruined the girls evening since they escaped Nightmare in Miami. "We are going to go fishing where it is safe." Hank said as he and Saunders gave Roger a dirty look.  "Hey I suffered pain you two didn’t." he told them rubbing his buttocks even more.  The women wasn’t aware that something evil had watched what they had done and recreated what the women created for the men, but in a much sexier version then the ones they had created. They also cast a spell that they could not resist what they created for themselves nor would the men be able to resist the women that had been made as a joke would turn out to be the creations of evil to kill everyone of them during sex so the wedding could not take place. The Dark Side was making sure there would be no more High Priestess or a new High Priest. The others would just be reducing the number of the warriors for the white light.  The women decided to call it an evening. Cheyenne decided to take a shower before turning in for the night while Hank was fishing. Cheyenne stood in the shower with soap on her face, she could not open her eyes as he caressed her breast. "Ooh Hank you decided to come back instead of going fishing?" she asked as she was feeling such hot pleasure from his hands when she felt the man up against her back, realizing who it was, she hurriedly rinsed off. He kissed the back of her neck pushing his hardness up against her, as hard as she tried to fight the temptation she could not. She turned around facing him where he lifted her up wrapping her legs around him.   "Ride that thang!" he told her as he kissed her taking her to her bed. When he threw her on the bed, she broke the spell. She tried to get away realizing something had gone terribly wrong with the spell when they made these men. Using her powers she was able to blow him up running out of the room to find Alicia struggling to get away from her attacker .Cheyenne flung her hand throwing him into the wall blowing him up using both hands." Come on something went wrong with the spell." She told her as they ran to the other rooms where they found Aggatha being strangled by one of their creations.  " Mother fucker!" Cheyenne yelled as she knocked him off her and Alicia blew him up.  "Make sure she is ok." She said running to Norma’s room where she laid dead in the bed. Cheyenne stumbled backwards seeing her dead. "Norma…" she whispered watching the man get out of the bed to attack Cheyenne, she blew him up. Quickly she began yelling as she ran down the hall." Fight it!"   Tammy blew up the man who tried to attack her.  "What went wrong Cheyenne?" she asked as they separated to save the rest.  "Evil intervened that’s what happened." She said going to Cathy’s room. Cathy had the man floating in the air and blew him up.  All the women survived except for poor Norma who was killed.  "If evil turned our spells on us, then what about the men?" Gloria asked.  The women without saying a word appeared on the boat where they found the women they created redone to sexy vixens of the dark side. they were trying to kill the men as hard as the men fought they still could not manage to get their magic to work because the eight witches had made it where their magic was out of order when they were with the women they created.  Cheyenne walked up to the three who had Hank down beating him while one strangled him." hey you three bitches come meet your maker." She said as the three women turned around just as Cheyenne blew them up. "C-ya!" she told the smoke they left behind.  All the other women had been taken care of except the dominatrix; no matter how hard they tried, they could not blow her up. Cheyenne changed into her warrior clothes looking at the woman.  " Ready to rumble?" she asked jumping up in the air spinning in a circle three times landing her feet on the fore head of the woman knocking her backwards. Cheyenne was able to throw Roger to the other side of the boat to get him out of harms way. She tried blowing her up, but it did not work on her. "Uh oh." She said looking at the huge woman growling at her.  The seven other witches each threw a dagger that giant female pulled out of her heart. "This is going to be a long night." Lindsey said looking at the woman.  The three warlocks and eight witches hoped the number eleven would be her un lucky number as they stood together as she walked towards them laughing they were able to blow her up.  "Now that was one tough bitch!" Margaret told them as she was out of breath from fighting with the big bully.  When they got back to the house Norma was sitting in on the patio. Cheyenne was leery walking up to her. "Norma is that you or something else?" she asked walking slowly towards the woman.  "Yes Cheyenne, it is really Norma. the council has made me the guardian of all of you. That means I am to foresee when evil is approaching, and I have the power to heal and restore life as long as it has not been for along time and only on the good attacked by evil." She explained to them." Now we have a problem there’s a group of evil warlocks who is intent on stopping this wedding because once you and Hank are united by the High council then we will have a High Priest as well as a High Priestess and evil is not crazy about Mystic Shadow. They really are not happy with Hank either or any of us for that matter. At the ceremony Hank will be given his High priest name." She told them.  "So where are the evil warlock’s?" Roger asked Aggatha.  "Unfortunately I can not tell you I don’t have that power, but just an image that you have to vanquish." She answered him." If this group is not vanquished there can’t be a wedding for we can’t take a chance of them getting to one of the High Council.  Cheyenne thought for a moment." Perhaps the book can help us." she said going to the room they made in the mansion where no one could find for it was behind a false wall. They opened the wall where all their pendulums and the ingredients of the potions were kept along with the book.  Cheyenne and the other’s sat around it in a circle as Cheyenne laid her hands upon it saying these words………  I Mystic shadow need help from the Witches' Word  I call upon the high council past and present Who have watched over the Moon the sun above and Earth below  to help me prepare   in this right and ready hour,  fill these pages with Thy spiritual power.  May no evil eye to see or possess the witches word  the secrets which have been entrusted with in thee  to help us find this hidden path  to find the evil who wish the death of thee and all that is good  hear me and lend Thy protection:  Revealing the truths of Earth and the Skies  show us the group of evil warlocks to our eyes.   For us the eight Witches whose book this belongs make us a map that is strong   to make our path the way to go be plain to see.  So we may continue to serve and protect for the good; so that through the coming centuries we shall still be.  Cheyenne raised her hands above the book where the pages began to turn by them selves showing them the evil warlocks. "It’s the four evil warlocks that traps the souls of the innocent children keeping them locked in a dark cavern. If we vanquish them, we will also free the children’s souls." She told the others.  Cheyenne held her crystal charm over a map it stopped in Jamaica in the same area they were at. "They are here. We have to cast a spell to make them appear before us." She told them.  Cheyenne went to a wooden box and took out thirteen wooden pentacles." Take this and hang them around your necks it will help to give us protection." She told them as she handed each of them one. She placed hers around her neck." Aggatha we will need a potion to vanquish these warlock’s. It will not be an easy task either. They are very powerful due to all the children’s souls they have collected through the centuries. Tammy write a spell so we can bring them to us on our turf." She said looking worried.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings ©  She looked at the three men with a wave of her hand she changed their clothes. They were now dressed similar to the women warriors’ suit.  " These warrior clothes have been blessed by the Higher Power to give us more protection and strength." She told them as the women transformed into theirs.  "If we lose this battle today all the children’s souls who have not been collected will be today. We cannot let them win. There are a lot of innocents involved, it’s not just about a wedding." She told them standing up as she read to herself the spell to be cast.  "How is the potion coming?" she asked Aggatha.  "It’s done and it will not only send them to hell, but where no one wants to go." She said.  "Where is that?" Hank asked.  "Where they feed him the evil souls that lost the battle. I just made it so they won’t have to wait in line." She said smiling.  Ok we should be on the patio where we have more room to move as soon as I cast my spell I have to hit them with the potion." Cheyenne told them. "Are we ready to go do this?" she asked everyone." Norma will stay here. You will be safe behind these doors." She said smiling at Norma.  They all stood in the middle of the patio in a circle holding hands as Cheyenne began the first spell.  "I Mystic shadow High Priestess of all that is good,  Demand before me the four evil collectors of children souls.  Where I may destroy them where no one else could.  Place in this circle instantly my evil foes."  Lightening began to crackle; the window began to blow with such force. It was not long that the four evil warlocks appeared in a sparkling fog in the center of the circle. the wind began to blow as hard as a hurricane , Cheyenne began to glow in a white light as the men began to attack the twelve where they used all their magic to hold them while Cheyenne chanted the next spell.  "I Mystic shadow High priestess of all that is good   Take my magical chains to bind these evil souls   As they have been captured by the powerful twelve  Wishing for their evil souls be fed to he the evil one of darkness  Using this potion to vanquish them sending them pass hell  Like we knew it would   I Mystic Shadow High Priestess order the   Release of the innocents souls from the cavern of these evil foes. As the magical chains that glitter of gold and silver wrapped it self around the four men Cheyenne now poured the potion on them.  "You bitch this is not going to work and we will fuck your Highness before collecting your soul." one of them threatened.  Then Cheyenne smiling at all four of the black haired warlocks dressed in long black jackets, shirts, pants and boots began to disappear.  "Um I think its working." she said smugly pointing at half of their disappearing bodies.   When the warlocks saw their bodies disappearing, they began to scream for they now felt all the pain of their victims and they were gone.  "We did it!" Aggatha said excitedly.  "It would have worked before, but everyone was all too fearful of them so they always won." Cheyenne told them looking up at the sky knowing now the children’s souls were safe.  The day had come for the two couples to unite for eternity. Cheyenne and Lindsey were so nervous during the day they could not eat a bite of food. When nine o’clock arrived the six other witches came to the room where they waited to begin preparing for the ceremony which would begin at midnight in the gazebo. Tammy, Patty and Cathy would work on Cheyenne giving her a mud mask, waxing her legs, bikini line, then a hot oil treatment on her hair, then bathing her in the oils. They rolled her hair in curlers, as they gave her a pedicure and a French manicure on her nails. They put her in her matching corset and bustier with the thigh high lace nylons, they had her hair in long French curls pulled back with a diamond hair clip.  Cheyenne looking at her and Lindsey’s hair she began to laugh. "We look like we’re from Gone with the wind." she told her.  "Now all we need is for Rhett to come in and say frankly my dear I don’t give a damn. "Lindsey said laughing as Margaret, Gloria and Alicia worked on her.  It’s time for the dresses the women told her as they helped them into each of the dresses ,the diamond earrings and necklaces when Aggatha came in with a box "Cheyenne must wear these." She said opening the box as she showed Cheyenne the Diamond clustered necklace that looked as if it belonged to a Queen, with diamond clustered earrings and bracelet." Oh they are so beautiful." Cheyenne said looking in the mirror as a vision came to her of her mother wearing these." they were mothers weren’t they?" she asked as tears came to her eyes.  "yes she made me promise when you were going to go into the holy union for me to have you wear these for it’s what she wore when she was united to Murkshadow." She told her grand daughter as tears filled her eyes remembering her beloved daughter." your parents would be very proud of you Mystic Shadow." She told her calling her by her given name at birth.  Cheyenne hugged her grandmother." I love you." She told her.  "Alright now stop before we have big puffy eyes from crying." Aggatha told her.  The seven witches had tears in their eyes at the endearment of these two strong women they loved and respected so much.  "Great you got us in here crying." Tammy said as every one started laughing.  They placed the veils on the women and using magic got ready in their hands maiden outfits Tammy and Alicia dresses of light red gowns with white lace on the straps, with matching light red heels and a crown of daisy’s on their heads.  As they walked down the stairs to go to the gazebo the hand maidens were on each side of their bride as the other women walked behind in them in long blue gowns the same as the hand maidens.  The men were waiting on the other side of the gazebo where they could not see their brides coming to them. As Cheyenne began to walk down the red carpet leading to the gazebo a white sparkling fog began to float in the air as tiny little fairies flew around her for this was their High Priestess and they were sprinkling fairy dust on her that glittered to give her protection  There was a beautiful woman with long red hair playing a harp as they approached. All of her followers were there to witness the union and meet their new High Priest that would help lead and protect them.  Once at the gazebo they stopped where they could not see the men.  And now the ceremony will begin to commence for the holy union.      THE WEDDING  “There are two couples who wish to be united tonight as two separate couples joining with their chosen mates as one. Hand maidens bring forth the brides.” The elderly man dressed in along white robe with a glittering rope around his waist, wearing tan sandals, he was balding with a silvery short beard.   Tammy held Cheyenne’s hand leading her to the altar before the man. Alicia bringing Lindsey before him.  “Handmaiden what is the name of the bride?” he asked looking at Tammy.   “Her name is Mystic Shadow our High Priestess your lordship,” she said as she curtseys before him.  “You may go back to your place leaving Mystic Shadow our High Priestess at the alter.” He told her as she left to take her place with the others. “Hand maiden what is the name of the bride?” he asked Alicia.  “Her name is Lindsey your lordship.” Alicia told him as she curtseys before him.  “You may take your place leaving Lindsey at the altar.” He told her as she took her place next to Tammy with the others. “Grooms man brings forth the grooms.” He told Roger and he asked.  ” What is the grooms name and who does he wish to be united with at the holy altar?”   “His name is Hank and he wishes to unite with Mystic Shadow our High Priestess our lordship.” He told him.  “And the other grooms name is?” he asked  “His name is John and he wishes to unite with Lindsey your lord ship.” He told him as he bowed before him.  “Very well you may take your place with the others.  Turning to Cheyenne and Hank. “Do you Mystic Shadow our High Priestess do wish to become one with this man Hank?” he asked her.  Mystic Shadow looked back at Roger as if she was waiting for him to stop her. “Yes High council I do.” She replied longing in her heart that it was Roger standing by her side. A tear fell from her eye unto the wedding bouquet.  “And do you Hank wish to become one with Mystic Shadow?” he asked.  “Yes your lordship I do.” He replied  Turning to John and Lindsey.” Do you Lindsey wish to become one with John?” he asked.  “Oh yes your lordship.” She replied with all the love she felt in her heart..  “And do you John wish to become one with Lindsey.” He asked.  “Yes your lord ship.” He replied.  “Our mighty Lord, our highest power we ask that you bless and protect these couples becoming one tonight to give them your love and protection from those whose might wish them harm in their union. We ask that of all of our holy beings to tie these couples in holy union tonight to keep them bonded in love , to be understanding, kind, to make love often never losing their sensuality for one another, let their be not hurtful words spoken to one another for love is not unkind nor does it hurt. Grooms always love and protect your brides for she is your soul mate from this night forward.  Now Mystic Shadow our High Priestess by taking Hank as your Husband he shall now become Murkcaster our High Priest. And now will both brides and grooms place the rings that represent the circle of your love on each other’s left hand.  The couples each placed their gold bands on their chosen ones finger.  “As our Mighty Lord and Higher Power and all of our beloved ancestors are the witnesses to these couples becoming one to love for eternity. Now I ask that each couple light the candle of Life.” He told them. Now grooms lifting the veils of your brides you may seal this union with a kiss.”  Murkcaster lifted the veil of Mystic Shadow and John lifted Lindsey’s. They sealed their Holy union with a kiss.  There began trumpets playing as the brides and grooms walked down the red carpet, their guest welcomed the newly wed couples.  Inside the mansion some of the witches had turned it into a huge reception center where the brides and grooms sat at their table and the guest would come up to dance with the bride or groom. Then it came for the brides and grooms waltz where both couples danced their first dance together as soul mates.  The high council made an announcement.” we had a special request today concerning our High Priestess. Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster please join me here in the center of the room. Mystic Shadow here is the special request.” He told her then stepping back.  A bright white light came floating down slowly when Mystic Shadow's parents stepped out of the bright light hugging their daughter and welcoming Murkcaster to the family.  “How is this possible?” she asked her parents as tears ran down her face.  “We were granted to be able to watch your union to our new High Priest and then for just a few minutes of life to be able to hug and kiss our little girl. Remember Mystic Shadow we are always with you. Murkcaster keep up the fine work of loving and protecting our child.” They told them then stepped back into the light where it lifted them back to the heavens.   Most of the guest gave their High Priest and High Priestess gifts of gold, diamonds and rubies to show their love and loyalty to them except for one witch who was known for being wise and was Mystic Shadow’s mothers right hand witch Mysticlure. “To you My Lord and Lady I give to you the gift of life to share and to love always.” She said waving her hand across the couple smiling as she walked away.  Then the High Council closing the celebration of the Holy Unions tonight gave Lindsey and Saunders a honeymoon trip to Paris.  Looking at Hank and Cheyenne.” I ask you to join me so you may begin your Holy union bliss.” He told them as they vanished into a white mist that was bright and sparkled.  They appeared in a beautiful room, there was a king size bed with a huge golden headboard with very fine intricate design. The comforter was of royal blue with light blue satin sheets and pillowcases, there was a balcony that sparkled like diamonds and crystals. The high Council left when two handmaidens came into get Mystic Shadow and two grooms’ men came in for Hank. They were cleansed in a large round bath with candles and incenses were burned. Cheyenne’s body was rubbed down with oils and clothed in a white satin gown that flowed when she walked. The bodice made with white lace, white slippers with heels were placed on her feet. She was brought back into their richly decorated room of gold tables, lamps that sparkled as if they were diamonds. She was placed in the bed where her pillows were propped behind her back. Hank had gone through the same ritual and placed in black satin pajamas and placed in bed next to Cheyenne where they were giving aphrodisiacs .” drink these.” they told them as they handed them gold goblets.  They stood there; they made sure it was all drank before leaving them alone in the room. They began to feel strange, Hank took Cheyenne into his arms kissing her softly, his hand ran down her body raising her gown up and removing it then removing his own as he brought his body over her’s and entered her slowly as their bodies began to move slowly together . He went deeper and harder as he kissed and sucked on her nipples, their breathing becoming heavier he could hear soft moans coming from Cheyenne as he rolled on his back having her on top of him caressing her breast. She moved in a slow sensual grinding movement. The heat and passion grew in their bodies; he grabbed her hips forcing them to go down on him. He went in side of her moistness even deeper, she drove him crazy with desire sitting on top of him caressing her breast. She rode him slowly and deeply until they exploded in a heated passion as lightening bolts was striking all around the room. They did not stop as if they had not noticed what was taking place around them. They made love for hours until they were exhausted falling to sleep in each others arms.  The next morning while they slept all the witches and warlocks, fairies every creature of good even Mystic Shadow’s seven witches , Aggatha, Norma, Roger and Saunders were at the palace where Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster were dressed like a queen and king as they sat on their thrones. When all of the High council came to give an important announcement.  “Last night the union of our High Priest and High Priestess was consummated and the royal child was conceived!”  Hank and Cheyenne looked shocked at each other as everyone in the palace cheered for the royal birth. Cheyenne leaned over to Hank.” I am pregnant. I’m pregnant!” she said as they jumped up hugging and kissing at the news of the birth to come. Mystic Shadow turned to face the crowd, her eyes met Roger’s eyes and she could see the sadness in them, but now she was bound to Hank for eternity.    Cheyenne remembered the day the Dark side kidnapped her and changed her life forever.  The wind began to blow harder when they all noticed the sky began to glow almost fluorescent green." Look at the sky isn’t that a strange color for at night?" Saunders said pointing at the green haze.  "Yes it is I wonder what is causing it?" Hank asked standing up looking at the sky.   It seemed to be moving towards them, Cheyenne went to the middle of the drive way to see it better, it was right over her when it appeared to be getting lower and suddenly it was surrounding Cheyenne" What is going on?" she yelled as she tried to get away from it, she struggled as if someone or something had its grip on her and she could not get away from it no matter how hard she tried. In a split second she was gone from the spot she had been standing in, all that was left behind was a rat with a decapitated head. Kimberly and Norma began screaming and crying as they tried to conceive what had just happened to Cheyenne. Ralph was barking and running around the green light as Ninja sat on the porch steps hissing at the green fog that lit up the night. Not realizing that their lives would never be the same. The men stood helplessly in the spot where Cheyenne had just been standing Suddenly everything went silent, even the women’s screaming and crying could no longer be heard, just the sound of the tree rustling in the breeze.  Hank, Roger and Saunders stood where Cheyenne had just been standing and vanished. "Where is she?" Hank yelled hysterically as he dropped to his knees crying." What the fuck is going on here?" he cried looking up at the sky.  Roger was trying to remain calm to get his senses about him." I don’t know she just vanished!" He said not believing what he had just witnessed." What are we dealing with here?" he asked looking at Saunders who was just as frightened and puzzled with what took place here.  The women remained on the front porch crying afraid to venture out where the men were standing. Kimberly began to feel sick to her stomach, she ran to the end of the patio where she began to vomit violently. Norma was frozen with fear to help her." Where could she have gone?" Norma cried realizing that they may never see Cheyenne alive again.  Roger knew he had to get Hank to pull himself together." Look Hank we both love Cheyenne, so if we are going to get her back we need to get ourselves together here and go straight to the bastard’s house." He said pulling Hank up by the collar of his shirt.  Hank looked at him with defeat in his eyes. "Don’t you understand? She vanished in some green smoke, right into thin air! Do you really think he is going to zap her back to his fucking house?" he asked pushing his hands off him.  Saunders saw the tension growing between the two men." Both of you just stop it! Cheyenne would not want this! she’d want you to work together, so for her both of you assholes just fucking do it!" he said feeling so angry for not being able to prevent this." Let’s go find Harrelson." He told the two men glaring at each other.  Saunders looked at the two women." Come on if you’re going or stay here alone." He said knowing he had to protect them from whatever this was they had encountered.   Cheyenne woke up to find herself strapped to a cold metal table, her clothes were gone, there was a huge bright light above her. "What happened?" she whispered feeling very groggy her vision blurry.  "You have been abducted like me." A female voice was telling her.  Cheyenne turned her head in the direction of the voice. "Who are you?" she asked the woman lying naked on another metal table beside her.  "My name is Tammy Anderson they got me last night." She said as tears came to her eyes. "You’ll feel groggy for a little longer then you will be back to yourself," she said crying as the door opened.  Cheyenne’s vision was blurry, but she could make out Mrs. Harrelson standing by the table. "You, it has been you the whole time. "She said trying to focus her eyes.  "Welcome Cheyenne, I have been trying to control my anticipation for your arrival with us." She said running her hand through her hair softly, kissing her lips softly with her own.   Cheyenne was trying to grasp what was happening here." You set us up by making us look for your husband." She said in a low soft voice.  "Oh you will be meeting my husband very soon dear; in fact he can’t wait to meet you." She said looking at Cheyenne’s body as she kissed her softly on her lips and caressed her breast wanting to do more to her.  Cheyenne was scared as she tried to move her face away from her.  " Stop please." She said in a low voice. She was feeling ill by her kiss and fondling of her breast.  "Rest now; Fredrick will want you rested when he returns here." She said smiling evilly    Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings ©    Mrs. Harrelson told her then went to the next table." Mmmm very nice, you will be all mine to enjoy." she said cupping her breast in her hands as she ran her tongue Tammy’s lips with her tongue." No please don’t hurt me." She cried.  Mrs. Harrelson smiled evilly at Tammy. "You won’t be hurt as long as you pleasure me darling girl." She told Tammy and kissed her passionately as she ran her hand over Tammy’s body.  Cheyenne was becoming more aware of herself and her surroundings." Leave her alone you dyke bitch!" Cheyenne yelled trying to help the woman next to her.  "You would have been mine, but Fredrick has chosen you for his." She said as she walked out the door.  Cheyenne raised her head up to look at the other woman. "Are you alright?" Cheyenne asked the woman next to her.  Tammy began crying. "God these people are from another world, their eyes glow green." She told Cheyenne trying to suppress her tears and the fear of death that she was feeling with her every being.  Green, I saw a green light last before blanking out. She thought to herself. She struggled to get out of the straps, but they tightened more every time she struggled. She laid there wondering what was going to become of them." Have you seen any other women?" she asked Tammy.  "All the women who have vanished are here, they bring water and food in here, and they look so strange." She said.  The door opened as Fredrick Harrelson walked in. "Beautiful." He said standing over Cheyenne gazing over her nude body." I can not wait any longer; I will have them prep you for our union." He told her touching her nipples.  Cheyenne recognized three of the missing women taking her out of her straps, when Cheyenne tried to break away they sent electrical shock waves through her." Behave and you won’t be hurt!" they told her as they dragged her out of the room.  They took Cheyenne to a room with a large bathtub where they scrubbed her body. Cheyenne could not hide the tears that rolled down her cheeks. "What happened to you women? Why have you turned to their side?" she asked as they washed her hair.  "He is our God, we are to worship him." One of the girls told her.  "Silence she needs not to learn too much, just that she has been chosen his queen." Gloria said.  "What Queen? What about his wife?" she asked feeling more confused.  "It’s up to him to tell you what he wants you to know." She said.  As Cheyenne was being dried with towels she noticed Gloria Luchese." Gloria I saw your mother the other day and she…" she said trying to get an ally to help her.  "That part of my life no longer exist, this is my family here." She said holding a green satin gown with emeralds across the bodice.  "I have a family that I love very dearly, please help me!" She pleaded with them.  As the women looked at Cheyenne their eyes began to glow green.  " soon you will join us Cheyenne." They said smiling.  Cheyenne was petrified wondering who was now inhabiting the bodies of the missing women. Would there be a way to get the women back? "Please I love only one man, my husband." She cried thinking of Hank and how he must be frantic with worry.  The women led Cheyenne to a room with a large bed covered with a canopy; it looked like a room out of Beverly Hills with its lavish furnishing. There were fruits in a bowl, champagne on ice. What the fuck will I do? She thought to herself.  Soon Fredrick entered the room." Leave us alone." He ordered the women. "Now if you want your husband and friends kept alive you will do as you’re told. When we make love you must be into it as much as I or they will die and then I will turn you over to your friend Otis to be his slave instead of my queen." He told her as he flashed on a screen showing Hank and her friends in the car looking for her.  " you see we always know what is going on with them and can arrange their demise at any time." He said pouring her a glass of champagne." Drink this so we may begin, I am very anxious to have you." He said handing her the glass.  Cheyenne knew she had to do what she was told or lose Hank forever. She sipped the champagne slowly noticing it made her feel strange as soon as she tasted it, the more she consumed the more strange she felt." I think I have had enough." she said trying to sit the glass down.  "Drink it all "he instructed her as he stood over her.  Cheyenne drank the glass of wine and felt the room begin to spin.  " I really don’t feel good." She said holding her head.  Fredrick picked her up in his arms as he kissed her on her lips he carried her to the bed where he laid her down softly and removed the robe he was wearing showing his nude masculine body. He laid next to her taking her in his arms as he began to kiss her, he rolled her on her back where he began to lick her stomach, in between her thighs as he began to pleasure her with oral sex her hips began to move as she caressed her breast, he entered her body with his hard organ. She screamed out in pain as he rammed it in her, he let out a moan. He caressed her breast while sucking on her hardened nipples, he began going in and out of her body harder each time.  " Make love to me like a woman makes love to her man. " He whispered in her ear, caressing her breast with his hand, as he held her thigh tightly with his other hand.  Cheyenne began to kiss him back, moving her body with his, he rolled her on top of him where he began to move her hips harder on him going deeper with in her.  " Fuck me you bitch!" he yelled as his voice began changing.   She felt his finger’s cutting her back like razors, Cheyenne was feeling her body respond to him in the heat of passion when she looked at his face he had changed into a demon with horns coming out of his head, but she could not stop her body from giving into him, she began to move wildly on top of him, she leaned over kissing him as she sucked on his tongue. Cheyenne was giving into the passion, she glanced at the mirror and noticed her eyes had turned to a florescent green glowing brightly. She became like an animal as they ravished each other, Cheyenne grinding her hips on him harder as she caressed her breast with one hand while with her other massaged her clit giving her another climax then falling into his arms kissing his grotesque face.  Cheyenne became like an animal as she rolled on the bed." More master, please more." she begged this evil demon in bed with her.  His laughter was so evil it carried through the house.  Fredrick threw her over on her stomach and rammed himself into her anal." Ahhhh I have been longing to fuck your plump ass!" he groaned in pleasure for now he was in his true demonic state of mind as well as body.  Cheyenne screamed out in pleasure." More master more; harder give it to me harder.’ She groaned as she felt him ripping her apart, her finger nails clenched into the bed.  When he was finished with her he began to return back to his normal self." Now you must pleasure my highest in command tonight as well my queen." He told her as he kissed her fore head.  Otis came into the room looking at Cheyenne on the bed for his pleasure.  "What are you going to do for me?" he asked as he stood naked in front of her.  "I am going to pleasure you as you need to be." She said sitting on the side of the bed giving him oral sex knowing he enjoyed it by his deep moans until he exploded with an orgasm.  He sat up in bed as she straddled him, he sucked on her breast, both of their eyes glowing green, Cheyenne bit his shoulder as she felt her body burning.   "Fuck me! I command you to fuck me!" she growled in a demonic tone.  He entered her body as she grinded her hips feeling such pleasures from him as she could not get enough of him , he threw her down on the bed giving it to her rougher and rougher until they exploded together.  Soon there were men and women in the bed with them as they had a wild orgy. Cheyenne and Tammy began to kiss and caress each other." Let me pleasure you my queen." She said as she began to kiss and lick in between Cheyenne’s thighs as she moaned caressing her breast.  "Let’s pleasure each other." Tammy said kissing her and they pleasured each other orally.  Fredrick noticed how much his queen was enjoying her self. He grabbed her by the hair." Drink my juices now." He ordered her as Tammy was giving her pleasure.  After the night of the wild orgy Cheyenne hadn’t any recollection of her previous life. She dressed in a long tight black dressed cut to her belly button exposing her large breast, black spiked heels her hair had turned black. Fredrick came to her the next morning." Come we must feast." he said leading her by the hand, her nails were black and she now belonged to the dark side.

      Seduced By An Entity Ch. 03 by Erotica_Writings © They all appeared at the High council where they saw Cheyenne in a long white gown, with a white canopy veil that surrounded the bed from the ceiling to the floor, everything was all white as she laid there looking so angelic and at peace when they saw Roger sitting in a chair by the bed where she laid. Two men led them into the room Roger looked up at them as they came into the room.  "Oh my God Cheyenne!" Hank cried out as she laid there looking so peaceful.  "Will you guys please shut up? I am not dead! I was knocked out! I have a horrible head ache! Your constant crying was killing me, so I told them to bring you here to make you be quiet." Cheyenne said sitting up in bed.  Aggatha looked at Cheyenne with a stern look." Your not dead, you gave me such a fright and all you can tell us is to shut up!" she said walking up to Cheyenne hugging her as they both laughed.  "I am too stubborn to die don't you know?" she said smiling." They tell me I can go home tomorrow."  Hank walked up to Cheyenne." I am so sorry Cheyenne." He told her as tears came to his eyes.  Cheyenne placed her hand on his." The guy was not real; the real guys are sows running around somewhere." She told him." But your not getting off that easy you have to court me all over again." She said smiling.  As the two men led them out of the room they were sent them back to the house where they were all relieved that life would not go on with out Cheyenne being in it.  The seven witches told Hank, Roger and Saunders how they found out about the men they turned into sows filmed the sex they had with Cheyenne and Alicia then showed it on the internet. When Cheyenne found out they told them how they altered the film seen so it would be the men having sex with men. Then Cheyenne turned them into sows. The men wanted to know where the house was located at. When they got the information they needed they went to the house they loaded up the five sows taking them to the slaughterhouse when asked how they wanted them cut up. Roger told them he did not care that he wanted the meat to be donated to a woman's crisis center for abused women. He would pay for the cost of shipping and what ever else it might entail for he felt it was for a very good cause.  The three men laughed at the thought that those sows that used and abused women would be dinner for the victims of abusive men.  Cheyenne arrived home the next day where the seven witches took her up stares giving her a hot bubble bath, dressing her like Cinderella, they escorted her down stares taking her outside where a white coach, a coachman and four white horses awaited her." What is going on?" she asked them.  "It's a secret; we've been sworn to secrecy." They told her putting her in the coach giggling as they shut the door.  The coach then began to move and began to fly through the air where it landed at the manor. People were dressed for Cinderella's ball, the coachman helped Cheyenne out of the coach, she walked up the stares to the manor looking at all the people there , when she went inside people were waltzing , she looked around the manor as it looked like the castle from the fairy tale. People watched her as she walked into the ballroom where she saw Aggatha, the seven witches, Roger, Saunders, but no Hank when she felt a hand on her shoulder. It was a stuffy older man." The prince has been taken by your beauty and wishes to dance with you," he told her taking her hand where he led her to Hank who bowed down to her.  "What is going on here?" she asked him as they began to waltz around the ball room.  "You want to be courted well I am courting you my soon to be wife." He told her as they waltz around the ball room.  "Please can we stop waltzing I am feeling sea sick?" She told him trying to avoid this.  "Not until you tell me... Will you marry me?" he asked holding her tightly to him.  "I need time to think, please. " She said pulling away from him and running up the stares to her room  Roger was quick to follow her." Cheyenne what are you doing? This is what you wanted." He told her.  Cheyenne looked at him like a lost child. "What I wanted doesn't want me!" she cried looking at him wiping her tears away.  "Baby, I love you with all my heart. I can't commit to myself much less a wife." he told her taking her in his arms. "I will love only you, and God knows I wish I was that special guy with all my heart." He told her kissing her passionately one last time. "Go on baby find the happiness you deserve." He told her watching as she walked slowly out of the room. He fell to the floor on his knees crying his heart out.  Cheyenne found Hank in the crowd. "Will you ever cheat again? Because so help me I will give you a vasectomy plus removal of your family jewels and feed them to the sharks!" She told him looking down at her shoes.  "That sounds so gross the way you put it." He told her." I will never stray ever again." He told her.  "And no more hurtful words?" she asked  "No more hurtful words." He told her.  "Then yes I will marry you." She told him.  At that moment she heard horns sounding. "Attention the prince has an important message to announce." The man said very loudly.  Hank taking Cheyenne's hand led her in front of everyone.  "I wish to announce the engagement of myself and Mystic Shadow," he said smiling then taking her in his arms kissing her.  "There will be a double wedding next Saturday in Jamaica." Saunders announced that he and Lindsey were also being married.  That night at the end of the ball everyone returned to Jamaica and Cheyenne led Hank to the bedroom.  "So big boy would you like to see just how naughty Cinderella can be?" she asked with her hands on hips shaking them back and forth.  "Oh yes Cinderella, why don't you show me just how naughty you can be." He told her as he lay back on the bed with his arms folded behind his head.  Using her magic and turning in a circle she changed into a red lace corset, bustier, and fish net stockings with red spiked heels. she teaseling crawled slowly up his body stopping when she got his pants as she UN buttoned them slowly, then used her teeth to un zip them.  "Oh yes Cinderella show me more of your naughtiness." He told her smiling.  She removed his clothing using her magic. "Cinderella likes nice hard lolly pops, can I lick yours?" she asked looking up at him with big brown eyes.  "Oh yes Cinderella be my guest." He said as she began to lick him.  She continued to move up his body licking his stomach until she reached his lips licking them ever so tender.  "Cinderella needs help getting her clothes off." She said kissing him softly.  "I can be of service there." He said removing her clothes by his magic.  "Can I ride the big Prince's horsy?" she asked sitting up on top of him massaging her breast.  "Oh yes... it likes to be rode." He told her as he entered her.  "Mmmm Cinderella likes your horsy." She told him as she moved slowly on top of him receiving him deep into her hot sweet juices, as she ran her tongue slowly around his lips and he longed to suck on her tongue. She moved her hips in a slow circular grind while the sensations he gave to her breast from his mouth made her even wetter and juicier until the fire built up with in them sending them into such an explosive orgasm. Her moans filled the night air sounding like a wolf who had lost it's mate.  "Did Cinderella do well by the big Prince?" she asked him.  "Yes and now the big prince will beg Cinderella for more." He told her throwing her on her back as they made love for hours.  Hank fell to sleep and Cheyenne slipped out of bed watching out her window when she saw Roger looking up at her. She softly touched the glass as a teardrop spilt from her eye. "Good-bye my love." She whispered still touching the glass as they both longed for the other one.

      	 	  	Seduced By An Entity Ch. 01 by Erotica_Writings © 	Seduced By An Entity (A Mini Series)  Cheyenne decided to spend the first day back swimming when a bottle nosed dolphin came up to her talking in dolphin language and trying to get Cheyenne to follow him.  "Ok boy show me what's wrong." She said as she held on to his fin where he took her to another dolphin that was injured.   "oh no, it's bad boy." She said to the other one who must be its mate. Cheyenne laid her hand on the wound as a white light appeared around the area where her hand touched healing the wound. Both dolphins gave her a ride back, they waved good bye to her dancing backwards in the water. It made her feel good to be able to help them. When she got back to the shop she over heard two women talking about how someone is hurting the dolphins and leaving them to die, so far ten had been killed. Cheyenne went back to where she found the hurt dolphin as she laid her hand where it had laid she saw two young teen age boys doing this for fun.  "You boys are going to be taught a valuable lesson" she said to herself as she located the boys on a small boat, Cheyenne turned her self into the sea hag where she floated above the boat where the boys were to scared to move.   "you're the ones who have being hurting my creatures of the sea, now you must parish!" she yelled trying not to laugh. Both boys were pleading with her not to hurt them.  "I will let you meet their big brother and know next time he will eat you!" she said as she had a huge whale jump out of the water the boys both were screaming.   "We will never hurt another living creature! We promise! just please don't let him eat us." They begged as tears ran down both of their faces.   "This is your only chance the next time you will be in your watery graves." She told them then vanishing.   Cheyenne arrived back to the shop she told the women what had happened who were laughing when the boys came into the shop. "We want to know what do dolphins eat?" The one boy asked.  "Fish, go down to the docks you can get some there." Tammy told them trying to keep a straight face.   That night every one sat out on the patio over looking the ocean watching the lights glitter in the night laughing at how Cheyenne taught those young boys a valuable lesson. Fredrick decided to make an appearance.   "Don't you people leave forwarding addresses?" he asked as he seemed to illuminate more in the darkness. "What have we done to deserve your presence here?" Aggatha asked him agitated that he was there around them.   "well not to see you dear woman, no I heard of this hot little witch who was murdered here after killing her husbands and lovers, I thought I would go check out the place she is haunting and perhaps spice up her haunting if you know what I mean?" he said smiling wickedly. "Unfortunately we know exactly what you mean." Cheyenne told him smiling.  "Have fun." She told him as he flew off into the darkness.   Hank decided he was going to turn in for the night that he'd see Cheyenne when she came to bed. Hank fell to sleep as he tried to stay awake for her. In his sleep, he began to dream of a beautiful dark haired woman floating into the room with him. She joined him in the bed teasing him with soft kisses, no matter how hard he tried to dissuade her advances he weakened giving into the lust. He ran his hands over her full breast feeling the harden nipples between his fingers, she sat on top of him riding him slowly, driving him crazy with desire as he grasped her hips moving them harder down on his body exploding in a passion from the lust of this beautiful creature. She whispered in his ear.  "I will return tomorrow night to pleasure you again." Then disappeared from sight.   Cheyenne came to bed it startled him from his dream it felt so real, when Cheyenne made an advancement towards him he kissed her good night.  "Not tonight baby, I am really tired." He said rolling over and going to sleep. Cheyenne looked at him strangely he had never been too tired to make love to her.   Turning her back to his she lay staring into the darkness. Now that Tammy had won Roger she was going to try even harder to make it work with Hank. Now it seems she had waited to long to make it work. A tear trickled down her face thinking of Roger with Tammy.   The next night Hank arranged to go to bed before Cheyenne not being able to get this black haired beauty out of his mind. Once again as soon as he fell to sleep she appeared in bed with him where he took her in his arms kissing her lips, neck and breast, then taking her with his every means of passion in his body, pinning her arms down to the bed as they both exploded again in a heat of passion. She left as he asked her what her name was. She just looked back smiling. Cheyenne came to bed and he pretended to be a sleep as he thought of this black hair beauty that seemed to be possessing him. Cheyenne awakening the next morning to find him standing out on their bed room balcony she came up behind putting her arms around him. Quickly he made up an excuse to get away from her afraid she would sense his sexual dreams.   "Hank tell me what is wrong with you?" she asked him following him back into the room.   "Nothing I just haven't felt myself lately." He told her not looking at her.  "I think I am going to stay home today and just lay in bed." He told her.   "Alright if that's what you want to do." She told him as she dressed to go to the shop. Wearing a red tank top, matching red shorts and white sneakers. She had her hair up in a bun on top of her head. Cheyenne left and he laid in the bed closing his eyes when he felt her presence in the room the lavender smell of her hair. Hank opened his eyes for now he was not sleeping and she was with him in the bed kissing him softly as he took her with a hot heated passion, he made love to every inch of her body.   Cheyenne walked in on the two of them seeing her husband making love to an entity with such passion , feeling the rage build inside of her without even thinking changed into her warrior uniform causing the wind to howl as it blew around her so strongly, her hair flying all around while Hank was still unaware of her presence she blew up the seductive entity using both of her hands sending her back into hells depths never to return and in one sudden movement of her hand had Hank pinned up against the wall . His face showed the fear that was with in him for he never saw his wife so insanely raged. She actually glowed a brilliant light, her face full of anger and hate at the moment.   "Cheyenne please let me explain what happened." He begged of her. Cheyenne quickly moving her hand smashing up him against another wall." And to think I mourned for you! I was going to give up my very existence because I blamed the high council and you betrayed me for a she devil!" she said as she slammed him on the floor." I gave up my happiness to be with you!" she screamed thinking of Roger.   "Oh and you never cheated on me? You didn't have a child by a demon?" he yelled at her feeling he had just made the biggest mistake of his life for his powers were no match for hers. "you son of a bitch!" she yelled jerking his body up off the floor and in front of her as her teeth were gritting as she spoke." At least when I screwed the demon he looked like you! I thought he was you! and when he tried to lure me with his temptations I fought it! Unlike you who enjoyed her! Rejecting me! Something I never did to you!" she yelled slamming him into the wall for one last time as she vanished from the room.   Hank was beside himself. What had he done? He quickly dressed appearing at the shop but Cheyenne had not shown up, he searched all over Jamaica but she was nowhere to be found. He went to Roger the one man who knew her longer and probably better then he did. After telling Roger of the she-devil, the spell she had on him until Cheyenne blew her into smithereens, how he threw Gore warrior in her face.   "You have really messed up Hank, first she was tricked into believing that he was you and every time after his deception that he tried to seduce her she fought him off until she thought you were dead. She only gave in to him because she no longer cared about life without the man she truly loves." Roger told him getting aggravated with Hank self pity.  "Christ she killed her own son when he killed us!Yeah I think you lost her." He told him feeling not an ounce of sympathy for Hank.   "You know her better then anyone please go find her and talk to her?" he asked Roger the one man who Hank did not want him near Cheyenne.   "I'll go, but if you get me vanquished because she is that furious I will make sure you join me buddy." He said smiling as he vanished knowing the one place where she would go to when she is hurt, it was the same place she went when she found him cheating on her. He appeared at the inlet in Pompano Beach, Florida where she sat on a bench in the darkness crying her heart out as the light house light turning into the darkness.  "It is still beautiful here isn't it?" he asked her startling her.   "Roger what are you doing here?" she asked wiping the tears from her eye's with a tissue.   "You have to promise not to hurt me when I tell you ok?" he asked her. "I promise there is only one person I want to hurt." she said looking at him with rage in her eyes.   "He sent me to find you because he didn't know where to look. I of all people should know since I put many a crack in that beautiful heart of yours," he told her as he sat down next to her.   "He purposely stayed home today so he could be with her!" she said as the thought angered her making the winds becoming strong.   Her tears flowed down her face as she looked into Roger's Eyes.  "He would not touch me for three days! There was always an excuse why he didn't want too." She told him leaning her head on his shoulder as she cried.   "He told me it started as a dream and it got to the point where he could not resist or fight it, he did try at first." Roger said in Hanks defense.   "For what five lousy minutes he resisted the slut? Then he couldn't resist?! Well if he wants her now he'll have to go join her in hell! If I see him right now that's where I will send him!" She said crying even harder as Roger held her as she cried.   Sniffling and being practically blinded by her own tears. "it's expected of a man like you to cheat, but I never thought Hank would betray me, shove me away from him, at least you would come home still finding me attractive and you still seduced me! By the way, thank you for always showering before coming home to me. " She said blowing her nose into the handkerchief.   "What do you want to do?" he asked her.  "I haven't decided yet. What do you want to do go back to Jamaica? I am going back there, just not right now, maybe never." She told him.   "I'd ask you to make love to me right here and right now to get back at him, but I would only be using you and that would not be fair to you." He said with her head on his shoulder watching the light from the lighthouse hitting the water.   She took his hand looking him in his eyes, with her other hand pulled his head down to meet her lips. She kissed him passionately, and then she stopped.   "It's not right is it?" she asked him looking back out on to the water as tears filled her eyes.   "You're at a very fragile state of mind. If we made love tonight how would we be tomorrow morning after you have calmed down and then you will hate me telling me I took advantage of you Cheyenne." He said not wanting to cause her any more pain.   "Could a man resist my seduction?" She asked her self as she raised herself up and across Roger kissing him lightly, licking his lips. She placed them in a Hotel room on a bed.  "Can you resist me?" She asked through tears," Can you resist my temptation?" She asked sliding his hand under her shirt on her breast. "Do you want me? Can you resist me?" she asked as she sat on top of him." Am I irresistible?" she asked crying.   "Cheyenne for you this would just be a grudge fuck and nothing else." He told her feeling his cock getting hard.  "You know I can not resist you, but I do not want to hurt you ever again." He said lightly touching her tears with his finger tips.   "It would not be a grudge fuck at all!" She said as she took her shirt off exposing her breast to him feeling his hands on her, his lips on her neck moving down to her breast. She moved her body in slow circles, teasing and licking his lips until they exploded together, she cried out.   "I love you Roger!" Calling Rogers name out with her whole body and soul. They made love all night until they fell to sleep exhausted.   Hank sat watching the star crossed lovers.  "God Cheyenne what have I done?" for not only could Hank see and hear everything between her and Roger he saw and felt what she saw when she walked in on him and the entity . he felt when her heart was ripped in two.  "Cheyenne I am sorry I broke your heart." He cried in his hands. He would not sleep in the bed for that was where he destroyed Cheyenne. He slept out on the couch.   The next morning Cheyenne woke up next to Roger gazing down at her." So do you hate me this morning?" he asked her for his worse fear was for her to end up hating him because Hank couldn't resist some entity.   She began kissing him lightly on his lips. "Not at all Roger you have helped me to make up my mind. I am not married to Hank in the mortal world he is dead and in the supernatural world it was never recognized. Soooooo I am free for my soul mate to come and claim what is his." She said smiling at him kissing him." Why don't you wake me up?" she said going under the sheet fondling him and then smiled up at him with a huge smile  ." well something is awake now." She said smiling as he made love to her that morning before going back to Jamaica. Once back at the house he told her.  "Cheyenne you need a special man, but I will be here if you need a friend for any reason." He said smiling as he kissed her softly.  This stunned her for she was sure he still loved her, but perhaps now Tammy holds his heart.   "Ok... as long as we are friends." she told him touching his cheek softly not wanting to show her disappointment. Cheyenne ran up the stairs to the bedroom. She blew up the bed as Hank stood on the balcony causing him to spit out his coffee.   "Cheyenne you came back home." He said smiling at her. he was happy to see her.   "Cheyenne I feel so terrible, I felt your pain last night, and how I caused your heart to break." He told her as he walked up to her.   She looked at him with content. "Shut up Hank! ." She told him, as she was upset that she waited to late to go back to Roger.   "Can't we work this out?" he asked her looking deep into her eyes.   "Its always I who gives in and forgives you over hurtful words, you some she devil because you took me for granted! So we are no longer married since your dead in the mortal world, our marriage was never recognized in the spirit world so we are free to see who we want, when we want and I am looking for a man who only wants to seduce me and only be seduced by me." She told him as she pushed her body up close to his.   "You really need to move your things to another room now." She told him in a whisper that sent chills down his spine.   That night Cheyenne and the other six single witches were going out. Cheyenne wore a white sequined shirt that ties in the back with just a thin string, with a matching short skirt that outlined her body with matching heel's, she wore her hair up in a French twist with two thin pieces that were slightly curled around her face. She wore diamond studded earrings, a white diamond tennis bracelet.  "looking good there old girl." She said smiling at herself in the mirror.  The other six witches dressed identical to Cheyenne but in different color's of red, blue, burgundy, silver, dark green, and a deep purple. They looked at each other smiling.  "We look hot and when asked we will tell the men we are a variety pack. " She told them knowing that Hank was listening to their conversation.   After the women left Roger walked up to Hank.  "giving her up that easy?" he asked him.   "I thought you were my friend instead you took her to bed!" He told him angrily.   "well stop blaming everyone else and put the blame where it belongs!" he yelled at him.  "now get dressed we're going to the club and what ever you do don't give into temptation if some gorgeous bitch tries to pick you up! And don't cause a scene when she rubs other men in your face, you are going to have to win her back, court her, and marry her in this world." He told him.   "She blew up her wedding band set." He told Roger.   "So you'll get new ones since you will be starting a new life together." Roger told him.  "now let's get ready to go." Roger and Hank dressed to go out to the same club as Cheyenne and the other witches were going to as well. Roger prayed Hank would screw up things between him and Cheyenne, then he could take her as his wife.The seven witches turned heads as they walked into the club, men were watching their every move, they sat at the bar turning their bar stools so they could choose what man they would have. Not what man would choose them?  "You won't believe who just came in." Alicia told them looking at Roger and Hank waiting to be seated.  Cheyenne quickly searched the bar until she found a very muscular Jamaican man who was completely bald, with a white suit on letting the jacket hang open exposing his black tight pull over shirt, black dress shoes, a gold thick chain hanging around his neck. With a thick gold bracelet around his wrist. Cheyenne began to look at him and when she caught his attention she smiled crossing her legs slowly, making her lips wet as she slowly ran her tongue across them, she looked at him seductive.  The other women seeing who she picked out to drive Hank crazy.  "Cheyenne you are so bad! You know it will remind him of Gore warrior." Tammy said smiling as she eyed a tall long blond haired guy, with blue eyes, a killer tan, wearing a black dress shirt with black loose fitting slacks and black dress shoes.  "I know isn't it great?" She said smugly as the man came up to Cheyenne. "Hello sexy lady." He said looking her up and down.  "Hello handsome man.' She said smiling seductively.  "Dance with me?" He asked her.  "Of course I will." She said putting her hands on his shoulders so he would have to help her down by putting his hands on her waist lifting her off the bar stool pulling her up close to him bringing his face close to hers.  "Let's go dance sexy lady." He told her as he took her out to the dance floor where He danced seductively with her.  Their bodies moved together as he ran his hands up and down her sides then he would dip her causing her top to go half way exposing half of her breast. licking her stomach slowly, bringing her back up his leg was be between her thighs moving their bodies in a slow grinding circular motion everyone was watching the seduction taking place on the dance floor as Cheyenne wrapping her arms around his neck rubbing his head slowly with her hands as her breast rubbed against his chest causing her nipples to become even harder .  "Sexy lady you are driving me crazy with desire I want to take you right here, but we would be arrested and that would be no fun." He said pushing his hardness against her as he turned her back to him pressing it even harder up against her as he moved her hips in a grinding motion." Come back to my place and let me show you how I can make you feel so good sexy lady." He said as he licked and sucked on her neck.  Cheyenne watched Hank fuming as Roger had to stop him from breaking the dance up. Cheyenne moved the dark handsome stranger's hands just above her pelvic looking very sensual." I don't think so, you have to earn me." She told him walking back to the bar stool where her friends were waiting as they had watched the seduction dance. The man stood there as he never had problems picking up women before, he had met his match making him even more interested in the sexy lady.  "Well what happened?" Cheyenne's friends inquired as they watched the man walking back up to Cheyenne.  "I got him hot and bothered he wanted to take me home I told him he had to earn me simple as that ." she said sipping on a soda smiling.  "Can I at least know your name sexy lady?" he asked her as Cheyenne found his Jamaican accent to be very sexy.  "It's sexy lady." Her friends said in unison laughing.  "You tell me yours first, then I will tell you mine." She said looking at him seductively as she was really enjoying teasing him with her body.  "Ok sexy lady my name is Devon, now do I get to have the pleasure of knowing yours?" He asked her smiling very sensual at her as he desired her body immensely. "Well Devon my name is Cheyenne; these are my sisters Alicia, Tammy, Margaret, Gloria, Patty and Cathy." She told him.  "So why don't you lovely ladies join myself and my friends instead of sitting so alone and beautiful." He told them determined he would have Cheyenne before the night was over.  When the women looked over at the table there were six handsome Jamaican men, some bald, some with long and short dreadlocks. Alicia was extremely attracted to the one with the long dreadlocks with sky blue eyes.  "What a coincidence you have six friends and I have six sisters." She told as he led them to the table introducing the ladies to the men.  "These are my friends Chevva, Desmahn, Leary, Fitzraay, Danavan and O-racy. " He told the ladies as he then introduced the women to the men trying to get each ones name right, when he got to Cheyenne he smiled." And this is sexy lady which I will be the only one calling her that, the rest of you call her Cheyenne." he told them as he seated her next to him.  The men stood up pulling the seats out so the women could sit down Alicia was in all her glory sitting next to Chevva with the gorgeous sky blue eyes. The men treated the women like queens ordering their drinks and appetizers for them. Cheyenne explained she could not drink alcohol that she was allergic to it.  When the song came on a woman's worth, Desmahn looked at Cheyenne "May I have the enjoyment of your company to this song?" he asked as he too had long dreadlocks, he was very muscular, his eyes were green,   "Cheyenne smiled as she could see he must be 6 ft 2."Of course I would love to dance with you." She told him as she looked his body up and down with a seductive smile.  She wrapped her arms around his neck as they moved their bodies slowly to the music he ran his hands down to her thighs then back up her back side as he turned her back to him they began to grind their bodies in slow grinding rotating movements her hands on his as he went up under her shirt feeling just the bottom of her breast. Resting her head back on his chest.  "I wish to make love to you, to lick areas driving you wild. Come out on the balcony with me for a moment to look at the view." He told her holding her hand leading her to the balcony where he stood behind her holding her close to his body as he kissed her neck, running his hands up under her shirt feeling her firm breast." Let me have you now woman." He said turning her around raising her skirt up as she tried to pull it down. "Stop it." She told him pushing him away from her.  "You think you can tease us and not give it to us?" he told her trying to force himself on Cheyenne." Well I am going to take it and make you sorry for being a little tease." He told her shoving her up against the railing.  Cheyenne became enraged at him." I can do what I want! When I want! And with whom I want! No pig of a man like your self is going to tell me any differently!" she told him lifting him up in the air with her magic." If you ever try to force your self on a woman I will personally come and send you straight to hell! From this moment on I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess cast a spell on you that from this moment forward you shall treat women as queens and you're to be their servant." She said lowering him back down removing any memory of what happened and he would not know he had a spell cast on him by her.  Roger and Hank stood where she could not see them as they watched to make sure she was safe. As they laughed when they saw her teaching him a valuable lesson on women.  " so Cheyenne are you enjoying the view?" he asked being a perfect gentleman when Devon came out to the balcony to check on Cheyenne since he knew his friend would rape a woman to get his sexual gratification.  "Is everything alright here?" he asked, as he was surprised to find that Desmahn was not attacking Cheyenne, but actually being a gentle man which he was relieved.  Roger looked at Hank." you got problems buddy, he is a really nice guy and that means you have competition." He told him.  "I will put a spell on him to make him not such a nice guy." He told Roger.  "Cheyenne would consider that being dishonest and you would end up loosing. Tomorrow send eleven red roses with a card saying that it will be complete when the 12th rose forgives him for his disloyalty for you are the twelfth rose." Rodger told him.  "The twelfth rose is me? "He asked him looking confused.  "Cheyenne was wrong when she said you had better brain cells, no it's Cheyenne!" he said smacking up side the head.  Cheyenne and the two men rejoined the others at the table when a slow song began to play." sexy lady may I have this dance?" he asked her kissing her hand.  Cheyenne smiled at him." I would be so honored to dance with you." She told him as he led her to the dance floor.  He took her in his arms dancing so close their bodies moving as he rubbed his hands up and down her back.  "I wish to make love to you all night Sexy lady, but I will wait until you feel it is the time. May I see you tomorrow night?" he asked her whispering in her ear kissing it gently."  She moved her body closer to his there was heat between them." I want to make love to you too Devon." She said as she looked into his eyes as they kissed softly.  When the evening ended Devon kissed Cheyenne good night. She looked up at him smiling." May I spend the night tonight?" she asked him.  He held her tighter against his hard body." Oh yes sexy lady." He told her kissing her passionately.  When they arrived at his house that was on the beach they stood on his balcony looking out into the night he took her in his arms kissing her as his hands roamed her body, caressing her breast, he un tied her shirt as it dropped to the ground , he caressed and licked her breast, he removed her skirt and thong sitting her up on the cement wall of his patio he began to give her oral sex as she placed her hands on his head . She was so hot; he carried her in his arms laying her on his bed made of bamboo with a mattress. he kissed her body all over bringing his body over hers, entering her slowly, hearing her moan softly as he grinded very slowly ,he rolled them over so she was on top grinding her hips. He felt her so moist, he caressed her breast licking them. He placed his hands on her hips pushing her further down on him; she massaged her breast moving harder taking him deeper into her wetness screaming out his name she exploded in such a fury." Devon! Oh Devon!' she cried out in complete satisfaction. He threw her on her back going deeper and harder inside of her calling out "Sexy lady!" kissing her breast lying on top of her breathing heavy.  They lay in each other arms he looked at her." You are a very sexy lady." He told her kissing her lips, breast licking her stomach lightly until he was between her thighs again.   Cheyenne closed her eyes feeling the passion, the desire he was giving her body, she moaned moving her hips as he made her feel so sensual. Her moans were becoming more louder when she exploded in such an explosive orgasm. He had her on her knees he entered her holding her hips tightly moving his hips harder and deeper in side of her exploding into an orgasm. After they showered he laid in the bed next to her." could I ask you to do something for me that I really enjoy."  "Yes what is it?" she asked him feeling him become aroused again.  "Could we both do oral on each other at the same time?" he asked as he gently touched her face." Let your hair down, I love long hair."  "alright." she said taking her hair down letting it fall loosely.  They perform oral sex on each other he was giving her such pleasure she took him deeper when they both exploded in a climax at the same time.  Alicia was also making the same passionate love to Chevva.  The next day they opened up the shop when they over heard two men laughing and whispering, Cheyenne walked up to them. "May I help you?" standing directly in front of them.  "Only if you can perform on me like you did to those guys last night." They said looking her body up and down.  "What are you talking about?" she asked how did they know about last night?  "We paid some bucks to watch you on the internet, how much would it cost us for a hot fuck?" the one older fat man. "I will cut your instrument off if you do not leave here." She told them not believing they had been made to look like whores and people paid to watch the sex they had.  Cheyenne and Alicia was UN aware that their love making was being watched on the internet as well by his friends for they were making porno for the internet using UN expecting women.  All eight witches discussed what had happened to Cheyenne and Alicia last night. Going to the computer they went on the internet, they found the one with them in it by using their magic they made it where the men were having sex with men. Then casting a spell who ever saw it last night saw men not them, and any time they were to use a woman she was to be viewed as a man.  "Want to have fun?" Tammy asked.  "You know we do." Cheyenne said.  "Let's go for an orgy and then play it back for them!" Tammy said   All six women wore their thong bathing suits with wraps showing up at Devon's house.  "Hi my sisters heard how good you were and want to know can the others come for an orgy?" she asked.  Devon smiled for he knew they would." let me go call them." He came back to the women." their on their way."  "Lets get started, starting with you baby." Gloria told him as the eight witches pushed him in the house on to his bed kissing him. Gloria performed oral sex on him, but on the screen she looked like an ugly fat drag queen.  When the rest of the men got there they had one scene where it looked like Chevva was having oral sex on a man while Cheyenne was behind massaging his hardness but on the film it looked like she was a big hairy guy giving Chevva anal sex. After the orgy was over the eight witches turned into their warrior clothes the men were starting to back up as Cheyenne blew up every camera they had in all of their houses with her magic. "By the way before I blow your asses up, because you really pist me off! We want to show you something." she said as she made a huge screen appear.  The men tried to escape from the eight witches but found they were suspended in air. The men watched themselves having sex with men; they showed them the ones from last night where Devon and Chevva had some hot sex with two very old homosexuals.  "Didn't yo mama tell you not to piss off a witch and what the consequences are when it happens to be eight?" Margaret asked them laughing.  "Especially when one happens to be the high priestess?" Tammy asked pointing at Cheyenne.  Cheyenne rose up in the air." Your one friend saved his fate when he tried to rape me; he is now a slave to all women as long as he lives. Death is too good for you! so I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light order these five men who wanted to play foul that they live out their lives as five fat sows." She said casting the spell then waving her hands at them as they turned into fat sows.  The fat little sows ran around the house as the eight witches vanished. When they returned to the shop Cheyenne found eleven roses with the card from Hank.  "He is trying to show you how sorry he is." Tammy told her smiling.  Cheyenne Looked at Tammy knowing she wanted her to reconcile for fear of losing Roger. "Yes I know Tammy, but he is going to have to court me, win me, and marry me in our union of Witch and Warlock." She said smiling." I have to teach him a lesson or every time temptation comes his way he'll be falling into some evil bitch. No he has to learn." she said smelling the roses.  "Well we turned the so called suitors into sows. " Tammy said.  "Well we will just make our own Devon who will not be real, but who will look like him, make love like him in my bedroom and I can put him away when I want too." Cheyenne told them smiling devilishly.  "I think Saunders and I should have to have a real wedding too and he will have to court me or lose me to another suitor." Lindsey told them.  The witches began making the men, Cheyenne using Devon's image and Lindsey using Chevva's, when ever they needed them they would snap their fingers and they would be there, when they did not require them they would snap twice and they would disappear.  That night Cheyenne recreated that night with Devon in her room as they stood on the balcony which Hank shared the next room he heard them out there giggling, he saw him drop Cheyenne's top as he kissed and caressed her breast, then he removed her skirt and thongs lifting her up on the wall where he performed oral sex on her. Hank lost his temper blowing the man up, the force knocked Cheyenne off of the wall where the only thing under her were rocks that the waves were crashing against.  "Cheyenne no!" he cried out realizing what he had just done. He tried to stop her fall with his magic, but he was not quick enough to freeze her in motion.  The others heard his screams as they ran to her room where they looked down from the balcony at the rocks where they saw Cheyenne's body laying there not moving as the waves were crashing against them. Thunder and lightening began to streak through the sky.  Hank appeared on the rocks as he knelt down beside Cheyenne holding her body in his arms as he cried holding her tightly.  "I caused all of this! She would still be here if I hadn't given into temptation! Oh God Cheyenne please come back to me!" He cried as she lay there lifeless in his arms." Please give her back!" he cried up to the heavens. The others appeared around them as tears ran down their face as they looked upon the fallen Cheyenne.  "What will we do with out her?" Tammy asked as tears rolled down her face.  Roger stood silent as he looked at the only woman he had ever loved in his entire life cried over her death." Cheyenne don't bring me back to this world if I have to live in it without you!" He cried out full of pain as tears ran down his face.  Aggatha stood looking at her grand daughter lying so still, so lifeless in Hanks arms as sprinkle of rain drops began to fall on her face as if the angels from heaven were crying. Tears ran down Aggatha's face.  " Oh my sweet, sweet child." She said crying looking at her grand daughter as her blood seeped onto Hanks arms as he held her crying.  A white light appeared with two of the high council carrying a white blanket." We are here to collect the High Priestess now." They said covering her body the white blanket; their faces had not any expression. They each held her lifeless body and they vanished.  Roger using his magic appeared at her place that she would go to when her heart was broken. Sitting on the bench they shared that night. "I hope you don't mind if we share your special place Cheyenne, because my heart is breaking into so many pieces I can't stand it!" He cried harder." I can't stand being here in this world if your not here!" he cried looking into the sky. "Why couldn't I have just been that special man for you? Damn it! Take me too cause I don't want to be here without her!" he yelled into the darkness of the heavens as the light house was the only light that could be seen. Roger vanished as the light shined on him.  As everyone stood where Cheyenne's body had been lying they wept in silence for their beloved Cheyenne that they had lost that night.  Hank's heart was smashed by the loss of his wife, he blamed him self for her death." My God I killed her when I blew up her boyfriend! It knocked her off balance causing her to fall to her death!" he cried as the guilt that was eating him up inside.  Aggatha went to Hank taking him in her arms "It was a horrible accident, just know in your heart that she loved you and she knows you didn't mean her any harm." She told him as he cried so hard in her arms.  Saunders stood quietly not saying a word as he stared out into the dark night listening to the waves as a single tear rolled down his cheek for he mourned his special buddy in silence. They all just stood there remembering a part of their life she affected. Norma remembered how good Cheyenne was to her, she made her part of their family.  Tammy felt guilty for making Cheyenne believe that she and Roger had a thing going on. She did not really find him attractive, she was jealous that all the men wanted Cheyenne. "Cheyenne....." she said crying into her hands.  Alicia cried remembering the fun they had the night before and then the next day turning the men into sows. She broke down hysterically.  "Why didn't she use her powers to prevent her death?" Lindsey asked crying.  "I do not know why." Aggatha told them. However, she knew in her heart that she must have wanted to die.  They all vanished into the night just as Roger had.

      A night with Erotica By Whispering_Wolf57   MMM I watch her silhouette in her bedroom window, she is my room mate, my land lady and my fucking desire. She makes me so hard with her words that are so hot, her body is working  to the music in that tight black dress of hers, those thick thighs is where I want to be in between taking my tongue over that swollen wet clit of hers, I get brave walking into her bedroom where she is dancing to her stereo holding a mixed drink in her hand and smiles at me turning in a circle wiggling that plump ass of hers and my heart is beating so wildly watching her hands on the sides of her thighs pulling her dress up almost allowing me to see that coochie of hers.   I feel my cock rising in my pants as her hips move so seductively to the beat of this wild sexy ladies music. She bends over in front of me allowing me the view of that gorgeous plump tanned ass. My mouth watered as my hand ran over my cock under my blue Jeans watching her body making love to the air. Running her hands over her body as soft moans come from her lips as her eyes are closed tightly and her body is moving so seductively that I can no longer control this primal urge raging with in from this witches dance of seduction. I move in on her taking her body into my arms and the black silk dress feels cool to my touch.   She looks up at me and utters between her lips. "Wolf" her eyes hold almost a mischievous fear in them.   "Erotica." Is all I can say as my lips passionately kiss her full lips feeling her suck on my tongue.       I picked her up in my arms carrying her to the bed and stood her on the ground as I pulled her dress over her head noticing she only has on a black thong, my mouth instantly goes for those luscious erect nipples that she refers to as N.E.'S. My large hand grasp the silky blonde hair of hers as I kiss her harder and passionately ripping her thong off of her and quickly remove the clothes that are confining my body from taking her. I am still clenching her thong in my hand as I lower myself down over her body and slip my cock into her hot, wet pussy, ahhhhh gawd she feels so hot, so tight against my raging cock,  Her legs are wrapped around my waist, her nipples taste so delicious and I twist them hearing her moan softly. Our bodies are moving together as one, we roll over so she is now on top of my 293 pound body, and the fiery wild cat she is pins my arms over my head, biting my bottom lip softly, she has the head of my cock slightly inside of her pussy and she moves slowly down the shaft with her wet juicy pussy that I just want to tear up with my hard throbbing cock. She began moving her pussy a little further down my cock and this was driving me wild and crazed with desire, I sucked on her neck, my hand is freed and wrapped in her hair and then I grab her hips pushing her all the way onto my rock hard cock. Her eyes roll into the back of her head as her mouth quivers from the pleasure that my cock is giving to her soaking wet pussy.   She grinds her hips hard onto my cock, our breathing is heavy and so intense, my cock feels as if it is in her stomach she has it so deep inside of her tight pussy. She digs her fingers into my chest, but the pain is making me want it more and I want to fuck her pussy, I want to fuck that pussy hard, I want to make her pussy scream as we both explode into such a powerful orgasm and her moans could be heard through out the house hold.   My whole world was being rocked into a night of pure illicit sex and I was loving it as she gave me just what I wanted. I only allowed a few minutes of rest before I had her by her wrist and  placed the cuffs on them as I smacked her ass with my large hand leaving a stinging hand print on her ass cheek and a sensation in her pussy. Before she knew it she was laying face down on the bed and cuffed to the head board, mmm that is when I enter her ass.   Ahhhhh I was biting her shoulder as I pounded her ass with my huge cock. The pain hurt and yet felt good all at the same time, then she felt the dildo touching her clit that made it feel so much better and she wanted more of my cock deeper in her ass, I tried stretching my legs futher apart so I could go deeper inside of her and then it happened the explosion that sent me deeper into total bliss. My cum shot deep into her ass and her pussy gushed her hot juices over the dildo her body was arching and twisting from the warm erotic sensation attacking her pussy. Mmmm the benefits of knowing Erotica Writings mmmm.

      Moonlit Meeting On The Beach... By Whispering_Wolf   It was a beautiful night for a walk along the beach I was alone and feeling a little blue. It was a long day one I thought would never end but lets not talk about that. I want too tell you what happened on my walk. This definitely made up for the day I had in more ways than you can possibly imagine.  When I got home from work I got undressed and jumped in the shower. My body was so tense the hot water felt so good relieving my aching muscles. I had music playing in the background as I just let the water cover me and enjoyed the sensations. I was feeling so good and was starting to get a bit horny. I put some shampoo in my hair and felt it run down my chest and back down too my ass and my cock and balls. It felt so strange but oh so good. Mmmmmm. As I was rinsing the shampoo from my hair my hands traveled down my body rubbing the shampoo through my chest hair down my stomach reaching my cock and balls. I take my cock in one hand and balls in the other squeezing and stroking too the rhythm of the water as it splashes my hot tight body. My cock grows in my hand and my balls tighten oh it feels so good..Mmmmmmm,mmmmm Oh yes I know I will have a hot sticky cum. Always the best place too cum in the shower, can clean up the evidence unless you miss a spot on the ceiling or something.. I am stroking my cock long hard even strokes squeezing my balls..* oh.* Yes mmmmmm gawd yes. I am so close too cumming..mmmmmm Yes stroking faster harder oh yes. I feel it building up. Oh yes oh yes.. I am cuming mmmm mmmmmm..awe. That felt so fucking good would have been better if I had someone with me too enjoy it. After the shower I got on my casual clothes white linen shorts Hawaiian shirt and Sandals because I was heading to the beach.   I parked my car along the beach and I get out. It is such a beautiful night the moon is full there is a cool ocean breeze and you can hear the waves as they crash along the shore. I enjoy going too the beach at night and just walking through the surf, it's so relaxing. This one night however I was going to be in for a very hot and wonderful surprise. Up in the distance I thought I saw a flash of red, the moon was full so it gave off a bright light that night. I started too move closer too see what it was I saw,  my jaw dropped too the sand when I noticed the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen in my life. She was a vision of loveliness I know it sounds like something from a book but it's true. She was wearing a long flowing red dress that looked tattered on the bottom so it just flew in the breeze you know the torn look. Oh! So sexy hmm. When I got closer I heard her crying and mumbling too herself being the caring person I am and a horny bastard as well, I walked up to her and asked if I could be of help in any way. She looked up at me and kind of flinched when I surprised her she thought she was alone then all of a sudden there is this strange guy in front of her. I introduced myself to her,  "Hi my name is Phillip" very nice to meet you.  She then told me her name was Cinnamon. it fit with her dressed all in red.. I asked her if there was anything I could do to help since I hate too see anyone crying especially a lady as lovely as her.   When I first noticed her the song "The Lady In Red" came too mind. I still can't get that tune out of my head nor do I want too. I want too remember this moment for the rest of my life. My cock gets hard just thinking about it, I mean her Oh Yeah! I mean her. Long blonde hair, brown eyes a face of an angel and the body too match. I fell in love in an instant not sure what was going too happen. I am sorry the thought of Cinnamon just takes over, let me tell you what happened. I ask her to take a walk with me in the surf, we take our shoes off and continue our walk and talk. The moonlight makes her sparkle as we walk and I need too stop and kiss her, so I wrap my arms around her and give her a very sensual kiss. I felt her kissing back, oh yes baby I was getting so fucking hot right now. I can feel her hands running along my back to my ass her nipples were starting too poke my chest and the kisses got deeper and more passionate. My cock was getting harder and harder. She pushes me away and peels her dress off letting  it fall too the ground. I take my clothes off and take her into my arms and lay her down. The feeling of the cool sand on our bodies as we roll around  is more than I can take. She climbs on top of me and gently slides my cock into her hot steamy dripping pussy. Mmmmm Oh yeah baby, it feels so good she slowly brings her body down on my cock, her pussy feels so good so wet so hot. She is all the way down my throbbing cock is deep inside her luscious pussy oh yes the sensation feels so good..mmmm oh  yes. She slowly starts riding me in and out up and down long and short. My cock is getting a riding like it never had before. I think I am in love oh yes baby. I want more, you make me feel like I have never felt before, these sensations are so intense, so hot and so sexy. Yes baby keep riding me I feel your juices flowing down my thigh. I reach down and stick my finger in her juices putting it to my mouth and taste it. Yes baby you taste so sweet. I want too eat you, my cock is harder than it has ever been before, baby I want to eat you bring that pussy up here now I am hungry for you. She climbs off my cock and then onto my face, as she lowers that beautiful pussy towards my face it drips it's sweet juices all over me. The aroma of pure sex, what a lovely scent that is and the flavor is so sweet. I get my tongue going as it gets closer and closer when all of a sudden she just drops her pussy right on my waiting tongue. Then I feel her mouth as it wraps around my now very throbbing cock. She licks her cum off the sides running her tongue along the shaft and balls. You can hear her smacking her lips at the taste of her cum. I do agree it is a very sweet cum one I wouldn't mind tasting every day. I am licking her lips separating them with my tongue I suck her clit in my mouth and suck on it getting every drop. She grinds her pussy and sweet ass into my face I savor every drop.  The feelings she gives me as she sucks on my cock, gawd she gives the best head and she takes it all the way down her sweet throat. I can feel my cum building getting ready to explode, she starts grinding harder and faster as she gets closer. Oh yes baby, oh yes I am getting ready too explode my cum deep into your throat. The feeling of her  pussy fucking my face is making me hotter I am going to explode I feel it getting ready to blow. Her body is quivering, shaking we both are going to cum together. Yes, gawd yes I am cuming. Oh baby I feel my cum shooting deep down your throat my mouth is full of your cum oh yes baby. mmmm gawd baby , you are so fucking great. I never came like this before oh baby you are the greatest, we light up a cigarette even though I don't smoke it needed one.   She got up and put her dress on. Smiled at me gave me a big hug and a hot kiss and left. Not a word nothing she just left, I found the woman I wanted to spend my life with and she leaves as quick as she came. I just lay there in awe of the whole thing as I reach into my pocket and notice a piece of paper, it was a note from cinnamon. It said " my number is 555-2335 I had a really good time and looking forward too much..much...more..Philip you are the best lover I have ever had and I think that I will ever have.”

      The Best Little Whorehouse That Ever Was... or Was It? By Whispering Wolf       I don’t know why I decided to walk home the way I did, it was just another ordinary day.  The same bullshit as always, but  deep in the back of my mind I had a feeling.  I can’t really  explain it, it was just a feeling.  Something was telling me that today was going to be special and that it would be a day I would never forget.  To this day many years later it still feels like  it just happened.  Wait a second I am sorry I am getting way ahead of myself here.   Let me start from the beginning, my name is Max and I work at a very successful brokerage firm.  At the time I was single with no attachments which I think worked out for the best at the time.  You see as I was saying I had a strange feeling or urge whatever you want to call it. Here is how it all came about I was On my way home, but I was drawn to a part of town I have never been too before. It was so beautiful, trees every where, birds singing, living in the city these sites quite rare. Sorry I keep drifting off as I was saying I took this new way home when I came across an old playground, Looks like it hasn’t been used in many years, the rides are all rusted out, foundations are crumbling. The entire playground is over grown with weeds accept, for one spot set in the back.  When I got to the spot, I noticed a trail leading deep into the woods, as I was standing there I could hear children’s voices from behind me.  I turned around there was no one there. It really freaked me out it sounded so real as I turned around again the voices started once more. There was singing and laughing, but when  I turned it stopped again. Maybe I was just hearing things so I continued on up the path, the further I went the more beautiful everything became. There was a calm feeling that came over me, a peacefulness.  Up ahead in the distance I could see something it looked like a house. Seemed strange a house being out here so far from everyone and everything. I could hear music, the sound of peoples laughter, voices of men and women’s.  I got up to the front door and swung the huge knocker they had on it. It was so loud it sounded like claps of thunder. Within a minute or so the door opened slowly and in the doorway stood the most beautiful lady I have ever seen in my life. She was wearing a black and red house coat with lace around the collar. It opened just a little bit when she let me in show me a bit of her quite ample cleavage.  She had the most beautiful brown eyes and hair so silky and such a lovely shade of blonde.  To me she was the perfect woman and to find her here in the middle of no where I thought I was just the luckiest man alive.    When she let me in, she offered me something to drink and a bite to eat. She looked at me with a glint of recognition in her eyes  as if she knew me and had been expecting me. I soon found out that this was a bordello you know a whorehouse. I was surprised to find  this out, Especially when I just fell in love with her at first sight. She took me to a private room where we talked. I could not shake this feeling even though we had just met, but feel like I have known her all of my life.  She laid me down on the bed peeling my clothes from my body. All I could think about was how beautiful she was, and how much I wanted her. Once my clothes were removed, she stood over me letting her gown fall to the floor.  I thought to myself how beautiful she looked and she has the most sexy body I have ever seen.  She lowered herself onto me gently kissing my lips, tracing my lips with her sweet tongue.  She was sending shivers up and down my spine, and at this time I wasn’t sure exactly what made me feel this way. She continued to run her finger tips lightly over my body just barely touching my skin. Oh, the feelings this lady was giving to me was more than I could take. I gently lifted her up and laidher down on the bed, She looks like an angel laying there such a beautiful smile.  She was whispering sweet nothings into my ear  as I lay on top of her kissing and blowing into her ear.    I am on top of her she reaches behind my gently massaging me as I continue to kiss and lick and nibble on her neck ears lips and her cheeks.  I start to work my way down along her chest over her  beautiful breast kissing licking my way down.  She smells and  tastes so sweet, her nipples are so hard I love suckling them,  the feeling of them in my mouth.    She is so fucking hot I have never been with a woman like this before and think I would never again either. She moaned softly as I worked her nipples and massaged her breasts. They are so beautifully shaped as I said before they are perfect.  I worked my way down her tummy spending time on her belly button I just love belly buttons. I trace it with my tongue kissing and touching ever so lightly as she did to me.  I come down spreading her legs to see the most beautiful pussy any one has ever seen. The taste, the scent it’s just beyond any description.   My tongue separate’s the lips ever so gently the wetness that’s forming I can see drops of her sweet as it runs down her thigh. I do not want to waste a single drop, it tastes so good.  I lick each drop as it runs down her thigh before it could ever be wasted,  Honey does not taste as sweet her body starts to wiggle and move as waves of pleasure start to over take her body.  She feels the pleasure my tongue is giving her.  She screams out and grabs my head as she buries it deep in to her hot dripping wet pussy.    “Now it’s your turn ”she says to me.    I can hardly wait I thought to myself.  She gets up lays me on my back and climbs on top of me. She takes my now throbbing and aching cock in to her hot and waiting mouth. Running her tongue along my shaft slowly stroking and kissing my cock, she is giving me feelings sensations I never felt before. Once she thinks I am ready she climbs on top and slides my cock into her dripping wet pussy as she slowly lowers herself down devouring my cock. She tightens her pussy and slowly moves up and down on my rock hard cock.    The sensations she causes drive me crazy and I want her more and more. I loved watching her breasts as they moved side to side as she rode me and they would jiggle.  She turned me on So much I wanted to shoot my load right then and there and it was going to be a gusher I have been building it up for so long.  Looking at her sweet face as she fucked me gawd she looked so beautiful.  The expressions on her face as she slowly rode me, I love giving pleasure like that.  I was so hot now I was just about ready to explode, the sounds she was making as she moved up and down my throbbing shaft, the way she moaned.  Oh yes It was going to cum any time now I could feel it building up ready to pop...and oh yes.  Just as my cock exploded she disappeared my cum just shot out into the air getting all over me and the ceiling and walls.    “What the hell happened?” I asked a loud.   Where did she go?  Wait a minute, as I looked around the room it appeared like it hadn’t been lived in for many years.  Dust everywhere, holes in the walls I just don’t understand what happened here.  Was it all a dream? A very beautiful dream, but still just a dream.  I felt like I met the woman I was meant to spend my life with.  I got myself together and made my way down stairs where I looked around to see if I could figure out what happened.  I noticed a few pictures on the wall and a photo album on a table next to a broken lamp. The album was so dusty and looked like it has been around for many years the pictures were faded, but you could just make them out. There was one picture of interest that I came across it was the woman I met last night, just as beautiful as ever turning the  picture over I could see her name and the date was from one hundred years ago.......

Walking by I saw the sign and had to stop in. The sign said twenty-five cents for five minutes I knew I was going to be cutting it close. So I already had my pants around my ankles and my throbbing ten inch cock in my hand. I waddled up to the sliding door with my pants trailing behind me and ready to put the first quarter in the slot. My cock was so hard I was so excited, never having tried this before. My cock was dancing around throbbing veins bulging my right hand tightly wrapped around the shaft my head so large and purple with pre cum already showing in the slit. Damn I thought to myself I better get started now I don't have much time. I reach over with my left hand inserting the quarter into the slot. Within seconds the door starts to go up. First I see a sexy pair of cum fuck me pumps with a pair of the cutest feet. Nails painted red wearing toe rings on every toe skin so soft and creamy. I was getting excited already wanting more my right hand squeezing and stroking my cock faster and faster. Time goes by so quick before I know it I hear a bell and the door starts to close. I quickly scramble getting the second quarter still holding my cock stroking at a feverish pace. Damn I dropped the quarter fuck it's so hard with one hand. I quickly grab up the quarter and put it in the slot the door slides up once more for my enjoyment. She is so sexy she turns me on to no end. I want her so fucking bad. The leather cup less bra and matching thong pulled up between her sweet pussy lips, oh how I would love to be her thongs. I am so close to exploding watching her playing with her pussy, moaning as she is fingering herself and tasting her sweet juices. She is even telling me how good she tastes. She licks her lips runs her tongue around her mouth savoring every drop. Takes her other finger rubbing her rock hard nipples pinching them tightly. Look of such pleasure on her lovely face.

      The call of the wild By Whispering Wolf  Author Whispering Wolf born and raised in Middleboro Mass, moved to South Florida where he met Author Erotica Writings three years ago, he is happily married to his sweet heart and writes stories of erotica.     I am walking down this dark lonely road and my only light was the full moon. I kept hearing movement in the surrounding woods and my heart raced wildly as I imagined all the wild animals devouring me. Then I heard it, I heard the call of the wild (howl) coming from behind me and I turned quickly to find the most handsome man standing there smiling. His hair was salt and pepper, eyes of blue, tall and huge in build, I was relieved to see another human being.  “Hi my car broke down a ways back and I am so glad I finally ran into someone.” I said feeling at ease with him.  “I am Wolf and you shouldn’t be out here at night alone. Follow me you can stay at my place and we can find help in the morning.” he told me in a firm way that made me feel safe with him.  We hadn’t been inside of his cabin for more then five minutes when the sound of a storm was approaching. He gave me one of his flannel shirts to wear that ended up looking like a dress on me, we sat in front of the fire trying to take the chill out of our bones. We were laughing and kidding around when he began to tickle me. We rolled around on the floor and he kissed me, we looked at each other for a moment and then our lips began the most passionate kisses I had ever experienced. I felt his hand going under my shirt and cupping my large breast in his huge hand.  “I want you.” He said   “ Oh I want you too.” I told him smiling shyly  Now his body was moving on top of mine and I felt him releasing his cock from his pants. The storm was going strong outside And we were creating quite a storm inside as well. He entered me slowly.  I moaned loudly, “mmmmmm”  “oh baby your pussy is so tight mmm” He whispered in her ear  “oh gawd you are driving me crazy!” I out cried becoming wanton and wild.  “Ahhhh your so wet, my cock feels like its in a warm glove” He told her keep a perfect stride going in and out in her pussy.   “I want it harder, deeper, oh gawd fuck me Wolf, fuck me hard,” I begged, almost pleaded.  “oh yes baby, yes, I am going to explode my cum deep inside of that pussy of yours! Mmm” Wolf told her with heavy breathing as his eyes rolled into the back of his head  “Mmmmmm I am cuming!” Mmm and then the call of the wild was heard through out the cabin  Wolf watched as I transformed into a beautiful white wolf and then we were running side by side through the trees out side with my gorgeous silver wolf by my side.   The end

      A Voodoo Queen by Erotica_Writings ©   By Erotica Writings   I want to tell you a story of a Voodoo Queen, she was a dark haired beauty that I had ever seen, smooth reddish complexion and her eyes gleamed. Long satin legs with the firmest thighs I had ever seen, mens head turned when she walked by. Women hated her for her beauty and I will tell you why. She could make a man grow old and forget the love he use to know. She’ll captivate you and at the same time decapitate you, She is most certainly one vixen not to be reckoned with.  Like a black cat she moves slowly with grace, she’ll lick your lips to see how you taste. Some called her a witch, but her name was that of Marie Laveau. She was way over a hundred when she died, yet she looked as lovely and beautiful as when she was twenty five. To this day admirers visit her grave leaving small tokens incase they meet along the way. This mysterious black woman in the 19th century was able to accomplish a most remarkable feat, she had white folk beckoning at her feet and drifted into the mens minds while they sleep.  She ruled New Orleans and it came to past that one day a prominent gentleman and father who was stricken with grief was sent to her door begging for her help and offered her his house on Rue Ste. The original site of New Orleans The infamous French Quarters. She went over the boys plight who was accused of murder, looking at the gentleman she smiled assuring him his son would soon be free, astonished the father left feeling relieved. Only had he known he gave his son’s destiny to the sorceress, Madam Marie Laveau, the Voodoo Queen.  That morning of the trial Marie visited a Catholic Church where she prayed holding three Guinea peppers and then departed, heading towards the courthouse where she persuaded a clerk with her magical ways to let her in the courtroom where she placed the three peppers under his seat. Or perhaps it really happened the other way as they say. She floated in through the window of his bedroom on an electrified cloud and seduced him first by dancing in slow movements with a large snake in the nude, seeing he was to petrified to move, She floated to his bed where she placed her lips on his and took that first kiss. Pleasuring him most of the night with her body and her sensual moans, touching her body in those very hot, wet zones. Once she has touched you in this way, you become hers, and for miles her followers chants could be heard.  What happens next is really not that perplexed. The end of the court session the son walked by his fathers side, and not once did the Judge look him in the eye. Marie claimed her house on Rue Street where women would come to her with their secrets they did confide. From their lips rolled their most intimate details of relations with their husbands, but they wanted to make sure their love would never die. Marie spent years in their husbands beds behind their backs, giving the men what their wives lacked. Marie gave birth to fifteen children and her daughter joined her mother into the dark side.  Mother and daughter held rituals deep in the Bayous woods,, complete with the worship of a snake called Zombi, and orgiastic dancing, drinking, and lovemaking. Almost a third of the worshipers were white, desirous of obtaining the "power" to regain a lost lover, to take a new lover, to eliminate a business partner, or to destroy an enemy. These frequent meetings frightened the white masters into fear the blacks were planning an uprising against them. In 1817 they passed a resolution forbidding blacks to gather for dancing or any other purpose except on Sundays, and only in places designated by the mayor. The accepted spot was Congo Square on North Rampart Street, now Blacks, most of them voodooists, met danced and sang overtly worshiping their gods while seemingly entertaining the whites with their African gibberish.  Marie decided it was time for only one queen and she would be it, the other voodoo queens crumbled at her feet and some met a violent defeat. Marie knew of the sensation that these rituals were causing out by the lake, and carried it one step further by inviting the public, press, even the police to her forbidden fun to attend. They came to her in droves paying admissions to watch the dance of sin. She became the most powerful woman of New Orleans arranging secret meetings for affairs of the heart for a certain price, Judges paid her thousands of dollars to win their election while others paid ten dollars for a potion to capture a love connection. While she serviced the blacks freely for to them she was their leader.  At the age of seventy Marie retired as queen and her daughter stepped in as the New Orleans Voodoo Queen. Her daughter became Marie Laveau the second, even began as a hair dresser just like her mother. Marie the second had less of a giving heart and ruled with instilling fear into her followers lives. Marie kept the “Maison Blanche" translated meaning the White house where white men would meet to have affairs of the flesh with the black women.  The day that Marie one died so did the fear of Marie two for the public connected the two women as one. In the cemetery there are two tombs for Marie Laveau and one is named the wishing well where lovers come bearing gifts of candles, oils or scents to insure their wish come true. And that concludes my tale of the famous Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau. ************************************************************************************* Dream Lover by Erotica_Writings © He floats into my room like a way ward dream, His powerful arms embrace me. His kiss is that of passion, His presence of heaven it would seem. His tenderness has captured my heart, His love has encased my soul. His touch has claimed my body, His heart has won my love.

For you are the one I love so. ************************************************************************************ I Can't Understand by Erotica_Writings © I Can’t Understand........  By Erotica Writings   I can’t understand belief’s of today,  I can’t understand how or when it all went away.  I can’t understand to days youth,  Murdering and killing underlining the truth.  Did we cause all of this chaos,  By wanting civilization and look away with a nod.  Did we cause our youth to fall,  Did we hand them the loaded gun.  What have we done,  How did we let the control get away.  Do I want to live another day,  Please take me back to the old way.  Back to honor, love and respect,  I can’t live with to days disrespect. ************************************************************************************ Memories Of Yesteryear by Erotica_Writings © She silently rocks in her chair, with loving memories of yesteryear. Rubbing her hands through her gray hair, longing for the man who called her dear. A single tear streaks her face, remembering their wedding day. Fifty years they lived in the same place, a home full of love and warmth. Now her body filled with pain, praying to be taken up above. Wondering if the loneliness would drive her insane, worried she was in her children's way. Longing for the one man she had ever loved, praying for the good Lord to take her above. Now her life is lonely and full of fear, she clings to her memories of yesteryear.  copyright(c)2003Erotica Writings  *********************************************************************************  Nasty Boy's by Erotica_Writings © Mmmmm Nasty boys, You give me erotic pleasure.

The Porthole of yesterday floods my mind, Trying to escape those moments in time. My eyes shed the tears of wasted years gone by, Filled with uncertainty if I will survive. My illness is like the flu of the mind, Never tender nor never kind. Stress filled moments exploding in my veins, Trying to keep from going insane. I feel like a small child not happy, but oh so scared, The porthole of yesterday is my worse fear. Is it death that is at my reach? Or perhaps the memory of a lost love I long to keep? Perhaps to be able to feel the summer rain, To be in control of the passions rushing my brain. To be able to watch boats float freely on the water, Instead I am held captive by my own leash and collar. Sitting here in my minds darkened room I dwell, The Porthole of yesterday has become my hell.

You lick me slowly wanting to feel my leather, Pleasuring me you beg to come. I make you wait as i lick you some, I sit on top of you taking just a little.

Full of fear and pain, Rubbing her tiny hands over blood stain's. Wondering why she was so bad, Always making daddy so mad. She just wanted to be loved, Maybe daddy would be happy if she lived up above. What if God didn't want her? Her little heart and body so tortured. She tried to be good, Was there anyone who understood? In the middle of the night the angel's came to call, This was her last tear drop to fall. In the wind you can hear her say, Daddy I will see you another day.  COPYRIGHT (C)2003 Erotica Writings

      Seduction By... The Serial Ch. 01 by Erotica_Writings © Mystic Shadow and the Furies  Her eyes opened slowly in the room that once was her bedroom before her demise. Why am I back here? She thought to herself sitting up in bed looking around at the room that had been left just the way it was forty years ago before her and Knight Shadow along with their warriors were sent home. She pinched her skin to see if this was really happening.  "Ouch dummy that hurt!" she said to herself aloud.  "It normally does when one pinches one self." He said smiling at her.  She looked at the stranger standing before her dressed in the white suit of the warriors, His hair was black, those dark eyes of his penetrated her soul and reminded her of her lost love Knight Shadow.  "Thanks smart ass for the brilliant info." She said when she realized she hadn't a stitch of Clothes on. She quickly grabbed the sheet up over her breast.  With a look of disappointment on his face he forced a smile.  " Let me help you out here. " He told her dressing her in the warrior's uniform.  Mystic Shadow looked at him and knew he reminded her of her beloved Knight Shadow. Sadness filled her body and heart. "Where are the others?" she asked as tears filled her eyes as she began to mourn their deaths.  "You are here to replace Guardian Caster, she requested to teach the children warriors." He said smiling and could not help feeling such an attraction to her.  Mystic Shadow looked at the picture of Knight Shadow and her on their wedding day. "Why can't he come here?" she asked feeling the loss ripping her heart apart as her bottom lip quivered.  "He is not meant to be on this journey with you Mystic Shadow." He told her trying to be gentle knowing that she was missing her husband and warriors.  She covered her face in her hands and wept for departed love and family. He could not help but to feel the pain she felt in her heart, he walked over to her and took her hands in his and pulled her into his arms where she wept like a small child. A single tear rolled down his face as he held her tightly in his powerful arms.  "Why send me back here alone to grieve?" she cried into his chest.  "We need you now Mystic Shadow, they had you for forty years up there, but we needed you to come back home." He told rubbing his hand over the back of her long brown hair.  Mystic Shadow pulled herself together and decided it was time to see her daughter Mystic Caster and the others. She walked a head of him when she felt her uniform had changed exposing her ass cheeks, she stopped dead in her tracks as she placed her hands on her cheeks and then turning around to see him standing with a boyish grin on his face.  "What do you have a death wish?" She asked him becoming more angered from his laughing at her.  "No but you have a nice ass and well I just thought . . . " He said as his body began flying through the air.  "You have a nice body and I just wanted to see it fly." She said smiling as she was brushing her long golden brown hair over her shoulders as the uniform fit her so well right down to her thigh high white boots like so many years before.  Mystic Shadow began laughing as he landed in the open door of Guardian Caster who approached the door smiling knowing her grand daughter had returned and would take Charge once more.  "Mystic Shadow please do not hurt the warriors." She said smiling as tears ran down her face.  "Grandmother." Mystic Shadow said running into her arms.  The two women hugged and cried and that was she heard Mystic Caster behind her. "Mother? Oh mother!" she cried out running into arms.  "My baby girl, oh you are so pretty." She said holding her face with her hands.  The three women walked arm in arm down the hallway forgetting that Mystic Shadow's pants had been altered.  Smiling rubbing his back when he got up off the ground, he smiled.  "She wants me." He said to himself trying to catch up to the three witches.  Mystic Caster looked at her mother's pants and began laughing.  " Mother are you redesigning the uniforms again?"  Mystic Shadow stopped and she began turning slowly toward him.  "Fix my uniform now." She looked at him with piercing eyes as he began to float up into the air.  "This form of violence is not getting you what you want, only what I want." He told her looking around at his surroundings seeing what dangerous thing his body might land on.  The two other women stood back as they saw the new beginning for Mystic Shadow and Raging Storm. They watched as Mystic Shadow began spinning him slowly in the air, then faster and faster until he gave in repairing her pants.  "Much better." She told him standing with her back to him rubbing her ass.  He smiled watching her walk away and then remembered why she was sent back. He ran to catch up again pushing Mystic Caster out of his way to walk next to Mystic Shadow.  A mystic caster smiled at him for he never ever showed any interest in women before." Must be lust?" she asked shaking her head smiling.  Mystic Shadow had flash backs of her and Knight Shadow walking down this hallway arm in arm, her beloved warriors popping out of their rooms and Jada Caster smiling at her. She fought back the tears that stung her eyes trying to be strong when in reality she felt like a frightened child. She looked at this handsome man next to her and forced a smile.  "So smart ass what is your name?" She asked smacking his ass sending an electrical current with it.  "Oh shit!" He yelled grabbing his ass and jumping around.  Mystic Shadow looked at him through Mischievous eyes. "Something in your pants Oh shit?" she asked with an ear to ear grin.  He looked at her trying to smile rubbing his ass. "You have awoken dead parts in me Mystic Shadow." He said looking at her like he wanted to just lay down and cry.  Mystic Shadow laughed as he was actually kind of cute. " Does your lil butt hurt?" She asked him walking up to him and placing her hand on his chest pushing him backwards up against the council's door.  "Do you think we should wait for our show of emotions Mystic Shadow?" He asked as her touch felt like electricity went through him and Mystic Shadow felt the same shock of electricity flow through her as well causing her to back up having only felt that feeling once before with Knight Shadow.  " Lets get back to why I am here." She said turning away from him and trying to run away from her feelings that she swore would never arise for another man.  Guardian Caster felt what her grand daughter was feeling and smiled knowing she would adjust to a new life without Knight Shadow. They continued to the main dinning room where Natanne and Mystic Shadows grand children were eating with the other warriors. Their mouth's dropped and silence quickly took over the room for no one knew Mystic Shadow was returning to reclaim her throne.  Her father stood up with tears burning his eyes. " We will win now." He said as he slammed his napkin down onto his plate to take his beloved daughter into his arm.  "What did you say father?" Mystic Shadow asked looking bewildered.  "They haven't told you why they brought you back?" he asked looking at Guardian Caster confused.  "Oh Shit you better start those jaws to talking or I may just turn you into ice for my blood is running cold." She told him with the look of death on her face.  "All right, first my name is Raging Storm and some of our most ferocious warriors have disappeared without a trace. We have searched all over and they may not be able to be saved." He said looking at her with dread.  "Who? Who are they?" she asked searching the room to see which of her beloved warriors were captured.  "The Furies, Mystic Shadow we tried to find them." Dark Lightening said looking at the ground.  "How long?" she asked him.  "One week, it's as if they just vanished!" he tried to explain to her.  Strong winds began to spin around Mystic Shadow as her eyes began to glow purple, her hair flew around her and she began floating in the air spinning as the room watched their High Priestess.  "We don't have long. The Dark Side has captured them. They won't be alive much longer. They are dying." She said landing on the ground.  "Do you know where they are at?" Guardian Caster asked.  "No I will have to scribe for them." She said and vanished.  Guardian Caster and Mystic Caster followed her to the sacred room with the book, and everything she would need. She held the pendant over the globe of the world until it came to rest on an isolated island protect by magical amazon women.  "Well looks like we are taking on the Amazon witches." Mystic Shadow told them.  Mystic Shadow acted as if 40 years had never past and turned back to her old self, she turned Mystic Caster and Natanne, and herself into the Furies, Mya into a Banshee, and her father into the powerful warrior he once was.  "We have family to go rescue." Mystic Shadow told them.  "Wait. I need you to have this now." Guardian Caster told her taking her hands and transferred her healing powers to Mystic Shadow.  Mystic Shadow smiled as she squeezed her hands and then they vanished into the golden sparkling mist. Guardian Caster looked up at the heavens praying they were right by just sending Mystic Shadow back without the original 12 warriors.  Will Mystic Shadow be able to save the Furies? Is the Dark Side capture of the Furies was to be able to bring Mystic Shadow back their Queen?  Seduction By... The Serial Ch. 02 by Erotica_Writings © Seduction of an Entity, The Serial  Chapter 2: Mystic Shadow and the Furies  Mystic Shadow and the warriors stood on the beach of the island not saying a word as the winds became stronger, lightening bolts striking into the water and across the sky. Mystic Shadows wrath could be felt through the energy her soul was penetrating around her and her warriors. A loud screeching noise could be heard coming from within the woods and Mystic Shadow located the three fallen Furies.  "Lets go rescue our sisters." She said as they all vanished into a golden fog.  Mystic Shadow appeared at the feet of the three Furies who were barely alive, she knelt beside each one healing them with Guardian Casters gifts to heal. The Furies opened their eyes seeing their High Priestess knelt over them dressed as they were. Slowly they sat up and each one looked around at everyone smiling and kissing Mystic Shadows hands. With the Furies back she and the others returned to their warrior uniform and began their search of the Amazon witches to make them pay for their attack on The White Light warriors.  Raging Storm looked at Mystic Shadow and was more amazed with this beautiful creature and felt so humble to be in her presence. Before he knew what was happening the Amazon Witches were standing before them dressed in black tight leather pants and halter tops, with matching thigh high boots. Mystic Shadow's wrath could be felt even stronger then before, her eyes glowed a brilliant purple, her smile was almost evil looking and with one swipe of her hand sending all twenty of the Amazon Witches flying through the air. When they landed hard on the ground up against trees, the call of the Banshee could be heard before the rest of the warriors attacked and sent the Amazon Witches to the fiery lake of hell.  That night back at the Palace Mystic Shadow had to go her spot where she use to go when troubled, She sat on the dock watching the Light house as it searched into the night.  "How can I go on here without my soul mate?" she asked in almost a small child voice as tears burnt her eyes as she slipped her rings back on her finger that she found in her lock box.  "I remember when you gave me these rings baby, we were in the islands and we were in the hammock making love, I tried not to fall off of you or the hammock, when you grabbed my hand and slipped the rings on. I was so shocked that I fell off onto the ground." She said as she began to weep as her heart crumbled into tiny pieces.  "I can't go on without you baby, I don't want to go on without you." She cried harder then ever when a bright light appeared next to her and Knight Shadow sat beside her holding her.  "You have to pull your self together Mystic Shadow, they need you more then we do up there. Its not my time to come back yet."He told her holding her in his arms, but she could not see or hear him.  "Knight Shadow I need you so much! Please, let him come to me, love me and fight by my side!" she cried up to the Heavens as Knight Shadow held his beloved wife in his arms the rest of the night.  The next few weeks were very busy for Mystic Shadow catching up with her grand children and her great grand children, Raging Storm stood in the shadows longing for Mystic Shadow to give him some kind of sign, while Knight Shadow held his wife in his arms as she cried herself to sleep.  Mystic Shadow, Natanne and Kathy were working with the other warriors getting them into the shape that Mystic Shadow expected of her warriors, she went so far as having demon attacks by the ones she created with her magic so her warriors would know what to expect. Raging Storm and Fierce Caster watched with folded arms.  "I think I will test her Highness." Raging Storm said as he vanished and reappearing behind Mystic Shadow only to be thrown onto the ground and Mystic Shadow on top pinning him down.  Knight Shadow watched smiling at the two and proceeded to push their heads together forcing a kiss. Neither could break loose and when Knight Shadow freed them they both just stared at each other without making a sound.  Seduction By... The Serial Ch. 03 by Erotica_Writings © Seduction of an Entity, The Serial  Chapter 3: Billy Jean  She wasn't more then twenty-three and had just ridden the bus in from West Virginia to start a new life in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Her hair was long, blonde and wavy, she hated the glasses she had to wear and swore she would get contacts. She squeezed her tall thin body in the back seat of the cab pulling her green mini dress down.  "I need to go to 405 North Ocean Boulevard please." She said with her southern drawl.  The cab driver never answered, just drove her to her destination. She was like a child looking out the cab's window at the beautiful ocean. "Lord, all we ever saw was the Blue ridge mountain's back home." She said aloud to herself.  The driver pulled up in front of the ocean front condominium as Billy Jean hurried and paid the driver his fee and then grabbing her bag off the seat next to her she hurried into the lobby, turning around and around smiling at everything around her with the look of an angel. Her smile was ear to ear as she approached the smiling security guard behind the glass window.  "Hey, my name is Billy Jean and a nice man by the name of Stonehenge has arranged for me to move into his apartment 1901." She told him in her trusting southern accent.  The guard, an older man smiled at the lovely girl who reminded him of his beloved granddaughter. His smile became almost full of pain as he remembered her death.  Billy Jean noticed the pain in his face. "Hey, are ya all right sir?" she asked as her green eyes sparkled up at him.  "You be very careful up there. He is strange." He told her not wanting to say to much out of fear.  Billy Jean took an instant liking to this kind soul. She looked around in the lobby at the beauty of the whole place as she caught the elevator up to the penthouse. Her key opened the door to the richly furnished condo with white carpet that her feet sank into. She removed her shoes and continued out to the balcony where she was in total awe of the ocean view that looked like a beautiful picture.  Billy Jean turned around thinking someone had entered the apartment for she felt eyes upon her, but saw nothing. Suddenly the warm balmy breeze turned to a bitter chill cutting through her like a cold blade. Billy Jean hurried inside the apartment where it felt as if the pictures were watching her when the phone began to ring. "Hello?" she said answering the phone when the only thing she heard was heavy breathing and then an evil laugh. Billy Jean looked fearful as she remembered the Security guards warning.  Trying to shake it off she went to shower in the black and gold bathroom with glass shower doors. She opened up the closet that was full of beautiful clothes and a note which read, "WELCOME ABOARD BILLY" She smiled thinking she was just being silly, Mr. Stonehenge was very nice.  Very nice indeed, the dancer before her disappeared off the face of the earth and the question is who was behind it? Billy Jean was dressed and ready to go when she got called by security to let her know the limo was there to pick her up. She came down stairs wearing a beautiful red sequined dress cut very low and just above her knees and tight fitting, and she smiled at the guard feeling like Cinderella. She was in awe at the limo and the driver was a tall busty blonde in a very seductive uniform.  "Dern this is fancy, if momma could see me now." She said feeling like a princess.  Billy Jean walked into the club and was shocked when she saw the women dancing and removing their clothes, she panicked and was stopped from leaving by the driver and then was knocked out by a huge man in black who had a rag in his hand under her nose. Billy Jean came to with Mr. Stonehenge raping her, she tried to scream and nothing came out of her mouth and the only thing she felt was his cock inside of her that felt so cold it burned her. She wanted to get sick as he grabbed onto her breast and was chewing and biting her nipples. She felt a burning sensation in her arm and saw the huge man injecting her with some drug. Her vision became blurred, his touches were making her body tingle and she gave herself to him, wanting more of his vile cock that she came so hard with his raging cock deep inside of her hot wet pussy. He moaned so loud as he planted his mark deep into her hot pussy.  The huge man helped her to her feet and then out to the bar where he locked her into a steal cage and her body began to move to the beat of the Jamaican music. Her hands roamed her body, she looked at the men watching her feeling so sensual and she began smiling as her fingers began playing with her pussy that still had his cum in it. She was rotating her hips around so slowly as her fingers pleasured her burning pussy, her eyes closed as her tongue slowly licked her ruby red lips as she seduced every man in the club with her act of pleasure. Mr. Stonehenge smiled as he smelled her scent from her juices on his fingers. She came so hard on her fingers that she dropped to the ground of the cage as she trembled with a hard gushing orgasm. The large man in black came to the cage and removed her taking her to the limo after shooting her up with more drugs.  He watched her sleeping in her bed as he laid next to her playing with her nipples and then began eating her pussy as she was out cold. He lapped up his bosses sperm along with her own cum and then watched as she begins to respond to his tongue and then he stuck his huge cock hard into her pussy and she moaned out, but she could not fight off the drug induced, sleep and he filled her pussy up with his hot cum, repeating the oral sex position known as 69 with him on top ramming his cock into her mouth, over and over until she screamed out from such a hard orgasm that she began sucking his cock that was deep in her throat until he unloaded his cum in her mouth.  That after noon she was dressed all in black, her complexion was pale from the drugs, she wore dark glasses and a black scarf as she was led by the arm by the large man who had marked her his slut. He roughly made her get into the limo and she weakly smiled and waved good bye to the sweet guard. They tested her by letting her loose in the club, she danced and groped the customers earning more than five hundred dollars that night. The big busted blonde drove her to the condo where she would be tested to see if she could be trusted not to run away. She stumbled up to the doors of the lobby as the limo pulled away when he grabbed her shoulder.  "What are you doing here?" She asked giggling.  "Walk with me." He told her.  Arm in arm they went across the street and stood at the shore watching the waves come crashing in onto the shore. Suddenly he had her by the throat strangling the life out of her. She struggled, but soon only blackness enveloped her whole being. He threw her in the water smiling.  "Now it is over for you." He said watching her body bobbing in the waves when a hand grabbed his shoulder and when he turned he began screaming.  Billie Jean stood smiling evilly at him. " Grandpa, I am here to take you to hell for the white light power." She said turning into Mystic Shadow as Raging Storm brought the real Billy Jean to shore where Mystic Shadow placed her healing hands over her.  Billy Jean came too coughing from the oxygen hitting her lungs, she saw Mystic Shadow blow the Security guard up as the warriors collected his soul to be delivered to hell.  Billy Jean looked into Mystic Shadows eyes and tears formed in her eyes.  "Go home to your mother now, and we have answered her prayers." She told her and then in a golden mist the girl was delivered to her front door in West Virginia.  Raging Storm looked at Mystic Shadow remembering their kiss and without warning had her in his arms kissing her so passionately, she tried to fight it, but then gave into her feelings wrapping her arms around his neck tightly.  Seduction By... The Serial Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings © Mystic Shadow hungered for his kisses and the caresses his hands were giving to her breast and ass, his mouth softly sucked her neck causing a wetness between those powerful thighs of her's. Their bodies slowly ended up on the sandy beach with him on top of her, kissing the woman he fell in love with the moment she opened her eyes. Mystic Shadow stripped them both of their clothing and straddled him with her long dark hair flowing in the tropical breeze as he entered her hot thick juices with his throbbing erection that Mystic Shadow could actually feel him pulsating deep inside of her. As their passions were building to an explosive climax the winds blew harder the closer they came to having an orgasm. Lightening bolts danced around the two lovers mixing in with the sounds of their moans until they both were over come with the most powerful explosion of pure erotic pleasure. The sky became a brilliant purple and pink as they vanished into thin air, the older man rubbed his eyes not believing what he had just witnessed when a hand tapped his shoulder.  "Yes?" he asked turning finding himself standing in front of Hank Thompson.  One swipe of Hank's hand and the old man was sliced into a thousand pieces, Hank blew air at him laughing as his body fell into pieces to the ground. His laughter was pure evil as he to vanished into thin air leaving the mans body behind to be found by beach goers. Hank showed up in front of the Manor where Mystic Shadow and him spent many years together.  "Bitch I am going to kill you before I allow anyone else to have you!" He said as he blew up the door to enter with glowing red eyes, dressed all in black.  Hank floated through the Manor as he looked around hearing the voices of the past playing over in his mind as he past each room and then he came to Knight Shadows room and anger filled his entire body.  "A shame they don't send you back so I may eat your heart!" he cried out blasting the door open to the empty room, somehow he almost thought Knight Shadow would be awaiting him.  "I almost miss you Knight Shadow." Hank said laughing making his grotesque demonic features even more noticeable wishing he could be alone with the man who had stolen his wife from him.  "He would just blow you up like before." Gore Warrior told him laughing.  "I seem to recall you losing the same battle with him and his brother." Hank retorted at Gore Warrior.  "Shut up before I blow you up!" Gore Warrior hissed at Hank making him cower from Gore Warrior.  "Nothing worse then a testy demon." Hank said under his breath as he hovered in his corner of the room.  Gore Warrior had his own plans for Mystic Shadow and him to rule the Dark side together or she dies a painful death. Without her beloved warriors he knew she would weaken to him and her lust for him. He would kill Raging Storm so there would be no one for her to turn too. Gore Warrior stared out the window that Mystic Shadow had spent hours sitting in trying to deal with her loyalty for one man and her deep love and devotion to Knight Shadow.  Mystic Shadow and Raging Storm ran through the palace like children shooting the other with water guns as the other warriors watched the High Priestess playing like a child. Mystic Shadow saw her father reading his paper from Paris on the terrace of the palace when she suddenly appeared in front him and shot him between the eyes. She was laughing hysterically at her father who was steaming.  "You two think this is funny? Well then I will show you funny." he told them standing up and a huge fire hose soaked the two love birds back into the palace knocking Guardian Caster over with the powerful water . Fierce Caster seeing what he had just done quickly vanished into gold smoke before Guardian Caster could reprimand him with her wrath. He stood at the lake laughing remembering the look on her face when a broom stick hit him in the back knocking him into the water and Guardian Caster's laughter could be heard throughout the palace and valley.  Flame Caster and Mystical Caster stood watching their grandparents and Raging Storm drenching each other, the palace and the valley with water. Flame Caster looked at his twin sister," Should we ground them after they clean up their mess?" he asked with his arms folded.  "If they will take their punishment." she said laughing as Raging Storm scared her grand mother by dropping out of the tree and shooting her with water.  Knight Shadow watched from the distance feeling pain as his beloved played when a hand was placed on his shoulder. " She doesn't know we were sent back." Rain Caster told him as the other warriors stood behind the two huge warriors as Knight Shadow was trying to conceal his rage with in.  Seduction By... The Serial Ch. 05 by Erotica_Writings © “Hello?” Caroline said in the phone receiver removing her earring, but no one was on the phone. Caroline looked around her apartment with her big brown eyes holding a fear that most of us know. Damn it she thought to herself and hurried out the front door grabbing her purse on the way out. Dressed for work in her gray slack suit, with gray pumps, she was going to be late for court and she never noticed the pair of eyes following her every move. Caroline ran through the parking lot of her building to her little red convertible driving away and oblivious to the stranger smiling at her.  Caroline ran into the court room already in and processed with her brief case in hand. Great impression when the DA is late to their own case. She thought to herself taking her seat at the DA’s table looking over at the defendant and his defense lawyer. Dirt bag she thought to herself and again unaware of the same stranger sitting in the courtroom watching her prosecuting her case. Caroline was happy when the Judge called a lunch break and had lunch with her assistant Paul Jefferson at the courts café and once more unaware of the stranger smiling at her as she bit into her sandwich in between giggles with Paul.

No one noticed the angel of death and the spirit warriors waiting to remove him from this world to a private cell in hell. As soon as he stood up to be sentenced and the judge said not guilty since he received a fair payment the angel of death reached into the mans chest and crushed his heart with his hand. The Judge saw the angel and the warriors and knew he had made a mistake that was going to cost him dearly.  Caroline smiled knowing that Justice had been served, yet she could not feel the eyes burning into her back, they began to glow red from the desire that was consuming her admires body, the desire to bash her head in and slashing her throat when they were finished with her. Caroline quickly walked through her parking lot of her condo, smiled at the security guard and rode the elevator up to the sixteenth floor to her apartment. She unlocked her door when she remembered she forgot to check her mail and without thinking only shut her door and took the elevator once again to the lobby to retrieve her mail. In the lobby the guard smiled as this was a nightly ritual for her, she waved as usual and once again rode the elevator back up to the sixteenth floor and then into her apartment, she laid her mail on the table to go over as she ate dinner, she walked over to open the curtains so she could look at the view from her balcony as she ate. They stood there with the rope in their hands, and an evil smile on their face, she did not have time to scream when they were leaping through the air knocking her breathless when they hit the ground and shoved a white rag in her face and then the black blanket over came her.  She woke up in her cars trunk, she was bound and gagged in her trunk being driven to an unknown location with an unknown person, she still felt groggy as she tried to stay awake, but the chloroform was still causing her to black out. When she awakened this time she was in a dark, damp room where she stood chained to a large beam in the middle of the room and she could hear the sounds of rats squeaking around her and then one ran across her foot, she tried to scream, but the gag muffled her sounds and tears streaked her face as she could smell her own fear.  Mystic Shadow sat straight up in bed with Raging Storm sleeping next to her and began to cry for it was only a dream that Knight Shadow and the warriors had returned to her.  Seduction By... The Serial Ch. 06 by Erotica_Writings © Tears streaked her face as the pain in her heart sharpened for her beloved Knight Shadow and the guilt that she betrayed his love. She walked to her window and sat on the sill wrapping her hair around her finger when an object caught her eye darting through the woods off of the Palaces property. She strained her eyes with the old feeling from her pass running through her blood like ice.  "They brought you back!" She hissed with such hate flowing through her and transformed into Mystic Shadow the warrior and vanished from the room reappearing in the woods in front of Hank Thompson.  "My wife how are you?" Hank sneered at her throwing a flaming arrow at her.  The arrow exploded in air from Mystic Shadows anger was radiating all around her. "Fuck you asshole!" She hisses flinging him into a tree. His body hit hard and the oxygen could be heard rushing out of his body.  Hank's body fell to the ground as he gasped for air to fill his now empty lungs. He tried crawling to get away from her, but again she sent him flying through the air and into another tree never laying a hand on him. Hank was becoming weak and his face turned purple from lack of oxygen when he disappeared and huge massive arms surrounded her body. Gore Warrior had her in his arms as she broke down into tears knowing he too was sent back, but not Knight Shadow.  For this moment his heart over ruled him and he held her as she cried like a baby in the arms of Gore Warrior. In his demon heart he did love Mystic Shadow and would not attack her in her weakened moment.  "Pull your self together woman, I can not battle you like the true warrior you are when you are so weak. I want your death to be worthy at my hands." he said kissing her forehead as he held the back of her head in his huge hand.  She did not fight to get away from him for some odd reason she knew right now she was safe in his arms and laid her head on his massive chest and cried. He closed his eyes as he held her feeling his heart race for this woman who had branded his evil heart.  Caroline was becoming weak from hanging in this room with rats running over her feet. She heard the door creek open behind her and felt their gloved hands on her breast as they now stood behind her and the leather hood that covered their head against her shoulder, she tried to get away, but could not go anywhere being bound as she was. Then she felt heat near her ass and the intolerable burn from her assailant burning her flesh with a branding Iron that sent a blood curdling scream from her very soul. She felt a punch that landed up side of her head and she almost blacked out as her vision became blurry as her eyes rolled in they're sockets. She felt something going into her ass causing pain as her assailant rammed a twelve inch dildo up her ass causing more blood curdling screams from her, she could feel her attackers body moving against hers and then a moan from being sexually satisfied. She heard their foot steps leaving the room and the door closed. She cried from the torture that was being delivered to her from this sick disgusting person.  "Oh God bless save me, I don't know how much longer I can hang on." she cried until she finally succumbed to sleep to escape the pain she was in.  Her head was hanging down when the attacker came back in to do more torture to her body, this time using an electric rod before sexually gratifying them selves. The rod had not even touched her skin when her head flew up quickly and long brown hair flowed around her face.  "Mother fucker I got a lot of issues to get over!" Mystic Shadow told Caroline's stalker as she flung them through the room hitting the wall.  Without a word as her uniform covered her body she walked to the attacker ripping the hood off to discover the assistant D.A. in Caroline's office was the attacker, Madeleine Cramer.  "No don't hurt me please! I just had to have her, I love her." she cried up at Mystic Shadow.  "I think that you going to prison with those you sent there will be a worse death then if I do it." She told her smiling as she dialed 911 for the police to come get this trash.  Mystic Shadow erased her memory of her and changed into regular street apparel as Caroline was sleeping on the couch in the living room When the Detectives arrived. Mystic Shadow almost lost her emotional control when the police arrived and the detective with them was Knight Shadow! Her eyes widened as she was speechless and he smiled at her.

      By Erotica Writings       Mystic Shadows heart beats hard in her chest cavity as he approached her looking into her eyes as her hands began to tremble, her head began to spin making her feel light headed and she collapsed in his arms crying. He lightly ran his hand over the back of her  head so softly with one hand as his other held her trembling body in his arms.  “I love you Mystic Shadow” He whispered in her ear as she wrapped her arms tightly around his neck..  “Oh baby you feel so good.” she told him kissing his lips hungrily as the whole room stood frozen in time.  “So what are you going to do with your new man Mystic Shadow? I haven’t any intentions of sharing my wife with anyone. You need to tell him because I will be coming home tonight.” he told her kissing her with passion and love as he placed his hand under her shirt feeling her hardened nipples.  The both pulled themselves together before he brought the mortals out of their frozen state in time. Mystic Shadow knew she would have to tell Raging Storm as soon as she got back to the palace or she would lose her husband again. Mystic Shadow answered all their questions and then quickly left so she could get back to the palace. As she materialized back in her bedroom Raging Storm was sitting on her bed looking down at his shoes.  “So you saw him today, I am happy that you two are reuniting once again and the original 12 are back together once more.” He said trying to hide his heart that was breaking into many pieces.  “I am sorry, if I had known they were sending him back to us I would not have let things go as far as they did between us.” She said feeling so lousy seeing him cover his pain.  “Well it happened and I think our warriors and High Priest needs a welcome home party Mystic Shadow, sorry your highness.” he said correcting himself.  “No, I am Mystic Shadow, and you are to refer to me as Mystic Shadow.” she said forcing a smile on her face.  “I have a party to get together now.” He hurriedly left the room so she could not see his tears stinging his eyes.  Guardian Caster and Mystical Lightening were busy helping with the party plans, Mystical Lightening was excited to see her grandfather and the other warriors that had perished in the last big battle against evil forty years ago. Mystical Shadow and Mystic Caster were busy opening their rooms that had been closed since they left earth that horrible day. Mystical Shadow closed her eyes to hide the tears of joy that she felt as she stood in Jada Casters room when she felt a hand on her shoulder. She turned to see Raging Storm dressed in the New white suits that had long white jackets, baggy slacks with white shirts and boots. With a quick movement of his hand a beautiful red gown with all the accessories waited for Jada Caster’s return. He vanished without saying a word.  “I hope he will be ok, he looks so sad now like before, He never smiled or laughed until he met you.” Mystic Caster said as she opened the curtains  Mystic Shadow looked down at the ground holding back the tears. ” I should have controlled my emotions, but I missed your father so much and the loneliness was killing me. I am so sorry he got hurt.” she said with tears forming puddles in her eyes.   “I am sure he knows you meant no harm mother.” Mystic Caster said hugging her mother as she cried on her shoulder.   *THAT NIGHT*  That night Mystic Shadow wore a black sequined lace gown, with black spiked heels, her hair was swept loosely up on top of her head. Her make up was applied with care, she finished with applying her perfume behind her ears, running her finger down her cleavage and then her wrist. Her stomach was full of butterflies as she was so full of anticipation knowing tonight she would be reunited with her love. She walked slowly down the hall listening to the guest in the ball room, Witches, fairies, leprechauns, unicorns, and every magical being was there to welcome their High Priest the most powerful warriors home once more.  The fairies flew around Mystical Shadow sprinkling their magical dust of protection all around her. Mystical Shadow entered the ballroom and was escorted by a warrior to the royalty table where her children, grand children and grand mother waited for the return of their beloved family. Mystical Shadow watched the doors to the ballroom open and in walked Knight Shadow looking so handsome in the new white suits, Rain Caster smiled at Mystic Shadow who raised from her seat and stood so straight and silent as tears streaked her face seeing her beloved husband and warriors. Knight Shadow held his hand out causing Mystic Shadow to float to him and into his arms where they turned as if they were on a revolving pedestal kissing and crying as everyone looked on at them smiling with tears running down everyone’s face that was in the room including Raging Storm whose heart crumbled. The party lasted into the early morning and Mystic Of Light had become friends with Raging Storm who was actually laughing again at this tender creature sent to him from the White Light Power.   Joni sat in fear behind the bush trying not to even breath so she would not be found by the strange creature that had attacked her and bit her shoulder while she was trying to change her tire out on this dark isolated road. Oh no what is going to happen to me? She thought to herself trying to restrain her emotions and wishing it would go away so she could get back to her car. Her blonde hair became stained from the blood on her shoulder that was almost bubbling from the wounds opening. Suddenly she felt herself being lifted into the air by the creature known as the skinwalker, known well to the Native Americans who do not even like to speak of them. The SkinWalker can change into different forms from human to animal and they are similar to the vampire. She felt the teeth sink into her neck as this hairy beast that looked like it was half human and half bear drank the very blood from her body.  “No! Oh please God save me!” she cried out hysterically as her soul escaped from her body that the creature had begun skinning the flesh so it would have another form to make to shape shift in to.  By the time the warriors had gotten there just a few seconds after her cry Just her body laid in the road with the flesh completely gone. Natannie knew it was the work of the dreaded skinwalker.  “No one is safe with the skinwalker on the loose.” she said looking out into the wilderness knowing that somewhere close by the skinwalker was celebrating its hunt.  Her blonde hair blew into the night air as the fire she built burned brightly and her new skin was perfect to catch more male skins with. She smiled into the fire wrapped in the fur she had skinned from the bear three hours ago. Tomorrow she would strike for more feeding of the blood, but now she must move into the cave that holds her crate where she will sleep until dusk comes again.  Natannie looked at Mystic Shadow when she arrived back at the Palace. “ We have problems. The skinwalker is walking on the earths ground.” She told her looking at the ground.  “Skinwalker?” Mystic Shadow asked pouring some coffee. “Yes they are Native American vampires They operate like normal vampires . As the Uktena and Wendigo purified the American continents, they encountered the Skinwalkers: very clever and resourceful Wyrm spirits that would move across the plains, from pueblo to pueblo and slowly, systematically consume all of the people.” She said sipping her coffee, “Because of their unique abilities to assume the shapes of those they kill, the American tribes more often than not assumed that the Garou and the Skinwalkers were one in the same-and not without little cause for the Garou continually prevented tribes and pueblos from getting too large. Skinwalkers are believed to be completely destroyed: the truth is that the few which are left have clandestinely merged into the Camarilla and the Sabbat, assuming high positions within each group and totally hiding from others. There is so much more to tell.”She said looking at Mystic Shadow.  “Call a meeting in the councils room in one hour.” She told her daughter as she and Knight Shadow went to their bedroom.

      Time After Time - by Erotica Writings  Sandy a tall red head, with green eyes, a great boob job from a 32 a to a 42 dd is a 38 year old exotic dancer, thankful that she still looks to be in her late twenties, early thirties she had to keep dancing for one more year then she could quit. Not that stripping hadn’t been good to her; she owns her 2003 black convertible corvette, her condominium over looking Pompano Beach, and has her choice of men every night.  Tonight she is seeing Vinnie a sixty year old man who is married with three grown son’s all lawyers and kept Sandy in the family. She would laughing tell her room mate Cher that she was their families whore. She slipped into a black lace thong, with matching push up bra, a black lace garter belt that held up her tanned hose. She slipped into a short black dinner dress that exposed most of her breast, six inch black spiked heels. Her phone rang it was Vinnie letting her know he was there.  Sandy walked up to the black limo and climbed into the back seat with Vinnie who sat with his erection out of his pants. She smiled getting on her knees between his legs on the floor of the limo and she began to perfume oral sex on him, his hardened erection softly pressed against her lips, her tongue slowly went up and down the shaft and all around the head, his hands were in her bra caressing her breast, then roughly he shoved her head down making his erection going further in her mouth until he oozed his hot thick juices down her throat.  He zipped up his pants after replacing him self back in his pants. “One hundred and I will see you when I return.” He told her handing the money and sent her on her way. She looked around at the street.  “Shit! He dropped me two miles from home.” She said to her self walking into a small bar to call for a cab and a drink to remove his taste from her mouth.” Could I have a whiskey sour and a cab please.” She asked the blond female bartender wearing a poor imitation of a playboy bunny’s outfit.  “Sure thing.” She said with a smile.  A drunken man in his thirties sat next to her. He placed his hand on her knee.” Where have you been all night beautiful?” he asked her leaning closer to her.  She smiled at him. “Oh I have been giving head for a hundred bucks.” She told him running her tongue over her teeth slowly.  The man with brown short hair, blue eyes that held a red glare looked at her swaying in his seat. “A hundred bucks huh? You going to buy the drinks then?” he asked her trying to hold his eyes open.  She couldn’t help but to laugh at him. “Sure I’ll buy you a drink.” She told him ordering him a drink.  “Your ok, I don’t care what anyone says about you, your alright with me. Hey someone told me you were giving head for a hundred bucks! I didn’t believe them.” He said shaking his head.  She giggled slightly noticing that if he wasn’t so drunk he’d be cute. “I told you that about me.” She told him.  “Exactly and I don’t believe it, I got to see it to believe it, want to show me?” He asked her almost falling off the bar stool.  “Well my cab is here, have a good evening.” She told him getting up to leave the bar.  “I am going with you, your buying the drinks remember.” He said following her out to the cab.  He pushed her in the cab and then fell in behind her. “Damn girl move over.” He told her trying to get straightened up in the back seat. “You want to kiss me?” he asked her with half opened eyes.  “No, not really, do you have a hundred and I will kiss you.” She said smiling at him.  “No not really.” He told her taking a deep breath.  She noticed the cab driver began going in the opposite direction. ”driver your going the wrong way.” She told him.  The driver an oriental man shrugged his shoulders and kept driving and he drove faster. She tried to open the door but they were locked. She could not get to him because of the metal mesh guard.” stop this car and let us out.” She yelled at him.  “Hey you heard her let us out of here!” the drunken man yelled punching the mesh guard. The cab driver just kept driving until he pulled in front of an eerie looking mansion.  A huge bald man opened the cab door to let the couple out and paid the driver who left. “Follow me.” He told them without any type of expression on his face.  “Why should we?” she asked grateful that she was not alone.  “I am taking you to Mr. Cadrula’s private party.” He told them.  The drunken man was all for this. ”Hell yes lets party!” He told them following them into the house smiling.  Sandy looked around feeling a little scared, they entered a room where there were naked people sitting around drinking. A very handsome man approached them naked. “Please disrobe and join in on the festivities.” He told them smiling at Sandy. ”Join me for a drink dear?” he asked Sandy  “Sure.” She said removing her dress and feeling strange being nude in front of him.  He smiled at her body. “We are going to have a great time he told her taking her to a secluded couch in the corner.  The drunken man was led to a tall blonde where he began to enjoy him self hugging on the woman laying his head on her large breast. Sandy felt like she was under a weird spell and could not resist him as he kissed her lips, he poured her a green drink and began running his hands over her breast, her vision was becoming blurred.  ” I feel strange.” She told him as she looked for the drunken man, she saw him laid back on the couch a sleep. Mr. Cadrula began licking her neck as he massaged her breast, he laid her down on the couch and performed oral sex on her until she filled his mouth of hot juices. She had never been with a man who could pleasure her better then her room mate Cher. She felt him enter her with his hard erection, he felt so good, he made love to her slowly until they both came in a powerful orgasm and she felt him bite into her neck until she past out.  When she woke up the next morning she was in the drunken mans arm. She still felt strange from last night. She noticed the man was looking at her. “How long have you been awake?” she asked him.  He smiled at her. “Long enough to wish I had a hundred.” He told her.  “So you remember huh?” she asked smiling.  “I remember everything about you and the big blond that blew my mind so to speak and then bit the hell out of my neck.” He said rubbing his neck.  “He bit me too.” She said remembering the strange handsome man. “Where is everyone?” she asked looking around.  “They fucked like rabbits and left just before sunrise,” he told her beginning to kiss her mouth.  She found him attractive sober and returned his kisses. Maybe it was some side effect of the weird drink the man gave her because she was hungry for sex and straddled him; he entered her body slowly caressing her breast as she moved in a slow circular motion, she began sucking his fingers one at a time, he placed his hands on her hips taking her deeper and harder when she began moaning from the pleasure of his hard erection until they both erupted into hot orgasms one after another.  She collapsed on top of him breathing heavily when she noticed blood running from his bite wounds and felt a warm liquid seeping from hers. She touched her neck and looked at the red liquid on her finger tips. She lay next to him, still staring at her bloody finger tips when sleep had over come the two new lovers.  Hours had passed as they slept peacefully side by side when they were awakened by the large bald man. He led them to a room that was upstairs where he drew their baths for them to cleanse themselves. Sandy looked at her new friend bewildered. ”what is your name?” she asked him soaking in the tub as he shaved over the bathroom sink.  He smiled at her.” Tim, Tim Jenkins and you are who?” he asked shaving his neck.  “My name is Sandy Lewis.” She told him washing her arms with the large white bath sponge. “I need to get to work soon.” She said finishing washing.  “What do you do?” Tim asked her watching how sensual she made a bath look.  She smiled at him. “I am an exotic dancer and private escort.” She told him.  “Ah so you were giving head for a hundred.” He said feeling almost a sadness hearing how she makes a living. “Well I need to get going to, I have to feed Fred.” He told her watching her step out of the tub.  She wrapped the large white towel around her.” Who is Fred?” she asked him walking to the large bed in the other room, she noticed there weren’t any mirrors in the bedroom just the small hand held that Tim used to shave with.  “Fred’s my dog, I imagine he is pretty pist and hungry.” He told her drawing bath water to bathe in.  The bedroom door opened and the large bald man brought in clothes for them to put on. Sandy looked at the clothing,” These aren’t our clothing.” She told him fingering the articles of clothing.  “Compliments of Mr. Cadrula Miss. Lewis.” He told her without an ounce of emotion running through his veins.  “How do you know my name?” she asked him looking weary at him.  “You told Mr. Cadrula last night.” He told her and left the room.  Sandy looked bewildered her memory of last night was blurred and the wound on her neck kept seeping blood, she found some gauze in the bath room and doctored their necks. She noticed they both had two puncture wounds. “I think someone was drinking our blood.” She told him jokingly.  “Nothing would surprise me, man I am hungry lets go eat.” He told her rubbing her stomach.  “Cute, very cute.” She told him smiling at him being silly.  TRILOGY 2  Time After Time   The two new friends walked out of the door and hadn’t any recollection of being in this hall, their minds were in a fog like state. At the table there were other people sitting around the table eating and drinking. The butler handed them both a thick red drink. Sandy looked at the drink as strangely as Tim did thinking how much it looked like Blood. They felt forced to drink the drink and once they had they woke up the next morning in bed together again.  “Tim what happened?” Sandy asked seeing he did not look well.  “Man I don’t know, I feel like someone wrecked my pecker and tried to saw off my neck.” he said wiping his hand over his bloody neck.  “Oh my you are bleeding badly.” She said running to the bathroom when she looked into the hand held mirror noticing that her eyes had black rings around them like Tim’s and her neck and naked body was covered in blood. Her head began to spin as she stumbled back to the bed.  “We have to get out of here they are killing us.” She told him wiping the tears away from her eyes that were swollen.  The bedroom door opened and there was the butler with clean clothes again for them. Without a word they began to dress with out an ounce of emotion. Again they drank the thick red drink and again they woke up together this time in each others arms feeling quite strange and horny. Sandy straddled Tim roughly pinning his arms back over his head and began to kiss and lick him as she felt his hard cock going deep inside of her hot wet pussy and they began fucking each other hard and furious until the climax changed their eyes to bright purple and fangs grew from their mouths. And now the hunt for fresh food was going to begin.  Sandy and Tim ran out into the darkness of the night when they spotted` the limo carrying Vinnie's two sons and Sandy knew they had scored their food on her own customer son's. They appeared inside the limo looking at the terrified men wondering who and what these two creatures were, before they could say a word Sandy and Tim were biting into the necks of their victims drinking their blood until they were quite full. They vanished from inside the limo before the driver had reached his destination with Vinnie's sons. As Tim and Sandy walked down the road arm in arm Sandy wanted to bring Cher back to the mansion.  Cher was sound to sleep in her warm bed when Tim and Sandy joined her and Sandy woke her up by giving her oral sex. Cher was excited to find her long lost room mate and friend in her bed, Tim began kissing her until his mouth was near her neck and lightly sank his fangs into her neck.  "Son-of-a-bitch your biting my neck!" Cher yelled out before everything went black.  Cher woke up the next morning with a sore neck and felt so drowsy from her friends visit to her room. She looked around and saw Sandy and Tim dressing like they were going to a ball. She then realized she was not in her room, the clock said six o’clock.  “Its six in the morning where are you going?” She asked clearing her throat that hurt.  “Its dinner time, not breakfast Cher, here is a dress and things for you.” Sandy told her smiling.  “What is going on Sandy and why do you look so strange?” she asked looking at Sandy through squinted eyes.  “We are giving you a gift to live forever like we have been given.” Sandy told her friend.  Cher looked around shaking her head as she felt the wounds on her neck were still bleeding. Cher quickly jumped from the bed and on top of Sandy.  “You bitch who asked you to turn me into some fucking freak?” she yelled pounding on Sandy with her fist.  Sandy became enraged and flew Cher into the wall with all of her power. Just then the door opened slowly as everything went black for Cher. When Cher finally came to she was in strange room chained to a wall with cuff’s and shackles, it felt as if a ball had been wedged into her mouth. Her eyes showed the fear surging through her veins and then she saw him, Mr. Cardell made her feel calm and she loved it when he placed nipple clamps on her nipples smiling the whole time and then placed his thumb on her clit that became alive with juices from his touch, she felt as if she was becoming like a wild animal wanting to mate with him. He held the thick red drink to her lips and slowly gave her sips through his seduction.  Cher felt warm and tingled all over, she felt him turning her so her back would be to him and her hips began swaying in a slow circular motion and then she let out a blood curdling scream as he rammed his cock up her ass.  “Tell me I am your Master bitch!” he whispered so evilly in her ear.  “Yes you’re my master!” she screamed as tears formed in her eyes for his cock was swelling and becoming so freezing cold it actually felt like fire.  His eyes began to glow and everyone stood watching him fucking her and the veins in his body were actually throbbing under his flesh, his fangs grew and then he plunged them into her neck at the exact same time he came so hard and deep in her ass. Once more Cher welcomed the blackness that helped her to escape.  Cher opened her eyes slowly finding herself strapped to a metal table with a gag in her mouth. She could hear laughter coming from the next room and then recognized Sandy’s laughter. “ Bitch.” Cher thought to herself. Then she saw him emerge into the room, she could not help this attraction she had for him, she felt herself becoming very wet in this black latex outfit she found herself dressed in.  “Good evening my new pet.” he said smiling down at her lightly touching her cheek.  “evening? I slept all day?” she asked noticing the glass in his hand that he brought to her lips and she drank without any questions for she was so thirsty.  He placed the gag back in her mouth and she noticed the room filling up with people and she could make Sandy and her new fuck standing smiling at her. He began connecting wires to her nipples, and clit and then she felt electricity going through her. She screamed and he laughed as he placed two fingers inside of her pussy and sucked on her breast slightly and each time he stopped she received an electrical shock.  She found herself becoming horny and each scream she noticed an excitement in his eyes which made her even wetter and her juices were flowing. She noticed that the others were getting turned on and pleasuring each other as they watched her being tortured by this man she was becoming so hot for.  “Mmmm please fuck me Mr. Cardula.” She asked him as her body was squirming from the shocking fore play he was delivering to her body parts.  “Not yet.” He said in a disinterested voice and sent electrical shocks through her again.  Her body wanted him and her mind was becoming part of his as she arched her hips upward towards the ceiling and screamed loudly until his mouth was over hers and his hands roamed her body slowly lingering on her nipples as he twisted and pinched them when she caught a glimpse of his hard erection.  “Master please let me suck your cum that I so desperately wish to drink down my throat.” She begged him.  “Not yet.” he told her playing with her clit between his thumb and index finger teasing her and driving her wild with the desire to explode into a huge orgasm and sent more electrical shock waves through her pussy and nipples.  His erection was pulsating with the desire to fuck her senseless and he mounted her taking her roughly and her screams turned into loud moans of pleasure as he fucked her pussy so hard and so wild and as he planted his sperm deep with in her he finished turning her into a creature of the night with the third bite into her wounds. Blackness embraced Cher once again.  None of the other creatures of the night noticed the tall blonde male with his partner with long brown hair, both men wore all black and carried large stakes with them………   Time After Time  *CONCLUSION*  The whole mansion was involved in a huge orgy when the two men stumbled upon the creatures of the night and without a word they were killing the unsuspecting creatures with their stakes burying them deep into their hearts causing them to explode in balls of flame that vanished into thin air. Sandy, Cher and Tim saw what was happening to the others as Mr. Cardula exploded in a ball of fire the three were able to vanish before they men could get to them. In the night air they flew as large bats with the other handful that was able to escape the clutches of the slayers.  They flew most of the night until they came to an old run down mansion. They all looked at each other wondering why they were led to this place and what led them?  “Why are we here?” Cher asked looking around at the cob webs.  “I don’t know, it was like a magnet was drawing us here.“ Tim said looking around at the eerie place when he heard laughter coming from the house.  “ What have you dragged us into Sandy?” Cher asked as she slapped Sandy across her head.  “Why did you slap me for?” Sandy asked rubbing her head.  “You got me into this, now I am a blood sucking freak and its all your fault.” she cried.  “Shit, You bitched that I never included you into anything and when I do you fucking Complain.” Sandy yelled feeling so frustrated with Cher.  “Fuck you Sandy.” Cher yelled as the others began walking into the house.  There were people having sex all over the place, women and men bound to chairs and tables as the others were dripping hot wax on their body parts, some were being electrocuted while some were cuffed and shackled by chains while they were being spanked.  Cher saw him and smiled so big as she hurried to be by his side. He turned slowly and then she saw how grotesque his face was and horns sticking out of his head. He grabbed her by the wrist and no matter how hard she tried she could not escape from his hold on her. He threw her on the large table, ripping her clothes off of her and then he was between her thighs squeezing her breast with his long wrinkled hands that had long razor type nails and entered her pussy with his large hard cock that felt so cold it burnt her pussy. She was turned on by this wicked sex and ground her hips with him as Sandy and Tim were busy drinking the blood mixtures that Mr. Cardula always served at his parties. They were not even aware that they had been blown into hell with the others that night and would be condemned to this hells house.

      Fred by Erotica_Writings ©  Fred is my buddy, he helps me out with sex when there isn't anyone else around. He is really cute looking too, purple all over, about nine inches long and hums to perfection. I can still remember when I picked Fred up, I was in the adult video shop trying to find the perfect porn to take home with my wine when I saw him and had to have him. He was purple and shiny and his batteries were even supplied for our first night of pure pleasure. I picked up the package that held him tightly and ran my fingers along his side so slowly licking my mouth to moisten my lips. A smile emerged on my face thinking how good he would make the movie, we walked up to the man at the check out desk, I paid for Fred and we walked out of that shop as best friends.  Now we both were a little uncomfortable the first time we did it, I was lying on the bed with Fred all propped up on the pillow next to me and every so often I would slowly run my long red nail down Fred's side wondering what my purple friend might taste like. I gently picked him up off the pillow holding him between my two hands and using just the tip of my tongue I softly licked the head of Fred tasting his latex, hm needs some more flavor I thought, so I slowly placed him in just the entrance of my hot juicy pussy. Smiling at Fred with my thick juice on his head I placed it between my red glistening lips sucking it off. That felt so good I turned Fred on and placed him back into my pussy, my legs spread wider and my other hand is twisting my nipples until they feel the burning sensation.  Oh my Fred felt so good vibrating the walls of my pussy that was becoming wetter, hotter and oh so very, very horny. My hips are bucking up and down and slowly around. Oh how I wanted to explode watching the blonde being fucked by that huge black cock on my T.V. screen. Beads of sweat formed above my top lip, I bit my bottom lip as the orgasm shot through my body causing me to moan out so loud from the hot erotic pleasure my new friend had just given to me.  A week had gone by since I last seen Fred and tonight Dave had stopped by for a fuck in the sack, as I was on top of his hard tanned body I reached into the drawer removing Fred from my drawer and placing him in my ass while Dave's cock was working my pussy over and biting my nipples with his teeth and Fred was drilling my ass making me scream so loud like a wild animal when I finally came all over Dave's big hard throbbing cock. Dave laid smiling at me as I wiped Fred down with some alcohol swabs and grabbed him from me, he pushed me back and began licking my pussy with Fred inside of my now dripping cunt. Oh, oh he was driving me completely wild as I first spread my legs as far open as I could then closing them tightly on his head as he and Fred worked on my cunt.  My nipples were so hard to my touch as I fucked Dave's face over and over until my pussy shot so hard the moist explosive orgasm all in his mouth, over his lips and all over Fred. I was trying to crawl backwards up the bed on my back from the powerful orgasm. Now Dave had me on my hands and knees fucking my ass with his cock, while I had Fred fucking my clit and oh my I was never so hot, so horny from all of this fucking from Fred and Dave that we both came so hard at the exact same time.  I remember the time when my friend Rick came over for the night he was laying on the bed on his stomach sound asleep when I removed Fred from drawer and turned him on. I smiled down at Fred as he vibrated in my hand and then I sat on Ricks back and began to massage him and rubbing my naked body over his and this was really turning me on I ran Fred over his back and down to my pussy and that's when Rick flipped me on my back grabbing Fred and straddled my face sticking his cock into my mouth and plunging Fred into my aching pussy until we both exploded from this erotic moment of sucking his cum out of his cock and being pleasured myself with Fred.  Fred and I are still together and we have even added some more color to our friends, Blue Joe and Black Jack. Well I need to go and fuck one of my friends have an erotic day baby.

      CHANGES  By Erotica_Writings   Marcy felt as if she had just awoken from a blackness of the unknown, feeling them cuff her hands as she looked around the room seeing nothing but pools of blood around her, and blood all over her body. Tears ran down her face as she became very afraid and looked down at her feet.  “Let’s go Marcy.” The lady officer told her leading her toward the door.  Marcy was very quiet as she quickly searched out the dead bodies on the floor with their brains blown out of their heads from the gun the police removed from Marcy’s hand when they arrived as she was standing over the man she had just killed. What happened? She thought to herself. Marcy stared out the window of the squad car as they headed toward the station where she was booked for murder and placed into a cell by herself. Marcy was charged with killing her psychiatrist and his family in cold blood.  Marcy lay on the cot in her cell wearing a gray prison dress and paper slippers on her feet. The tear’s streaked her face as she recalled the bloody bodies without any recollection as to what had taken place.   “What have you done Carol?” she asked herself feeling fear seeping into her soul.  Marcy was being treated for a split personality by her doctor that she is charged with murdering. She had just learned that she suffered from this identity disorder last month after her husband left her when he found her in bed with the gardener. She did not have any recollection of the affair just as she hadn’t any recollection of the murder, Unaware that on the other side of town they had just discovered the other murder victim she left behind.  Marcy lay on the cot with tears running down her face, why, why did you kill our doctor? She kept repeating over in her mind hoping the personality that she had only heard of would answer her with an explanation. Marcy went into the dark room where she always went when she was scared, riding the giant rocking horse ever since she was a tiny child, she always heard laughter until the evil giggle tried to break her ear drums with its horrible screech that she just completely blacked out to escape from the evilness it projected to her and the other voices she could hear crying. She sat up smiling on her cot, taking in her surroundings and wanting a cigarette so bad she felt she was going crazy. She walked to the open door to her cell looking at all the other women who were sitting down stairs playing cards at the long brown tables.  “I need a fucking smoke!” she whispered under her breath looking around trying to figure out how to get it since smoking is prohibited in jail.  A large black female guard approached her smiling. “ The Detectives want you.” She told her seeing she was agitated.  Marcy was taken into Detective’s Havarro and Lipkins office to be interrogated. “ Sit down Marcy.” He said pointing at the chair.  “Give me a smoke and I’ll sit anywhere you want me too.” She said twisting the end of long drab brown hair around her finger.  “Better get use to quitting you will be going away for a very long time Marcy.” Detective Havarro told her smiling.  “Fuck you cop.  I haven’t done anything!” She said coolly with her green eyes shooting daggers out of them.  “We caught you with the gun in your hand.” Lipkins said between gritted teeth with the visions of the bloodied family on the floor.  “No, you caught Marcy, he fucking killed them, not us.” She said running both hands through her hair.  “You’re not Marcy?” Lipkins asked looking at Havarro.  “No ass wipe I am Carol, and if you want any more info get me some smokes.” She told them smiling so cocky at the detectives.  “Fuck!” Havarro said knowing, but she would not tell them anything without the cigarettes.  They took Marcy outside so she could smoke while she told them the story. She took a deep drag off of the cigarette as she sat feeling the wind against her face, blowing her long hair into the breeze.  “He began treating Christy five years ago, then he discovered us when they were at the cheap motel and I emerged while he was making her suck his cock by forcing her head down on into his lap. “ She sucked Hard on another cigarette.  “He knew it wasn’t her when I started to roll that sucker in my mouth and then licked the fucking head slowly with my tongue like this.” She told them as she licked and sucked her finger tip.  “So he was having an affair with you?” Havarro asked.  “No he was raping the innocent ones just like their low life father did, and of course I would protect the innocent ones so they would not have to feel the fear any more.” She said with tears building in her eyes.  “So who is he? Another Identity?” Lipkins asked her smoking one of her cigarettes.  “It’s the doctor himself, fucking A he framed Marcy like he framed her for the missing necklace of his wives.” She said looking Havarro in his eyes.  Havarro felt a chill run through his body, “How?” he asked feeling a sickness in his stomach.  Marcy smiled shaking her head.” He got a street person, who matched his description, cleaned him up, had him work around the house so people would see him and think it was the doctor outside. Then he called Marcy and made her watch him killing those poor people, the little girls . . .  she was so scared and begged her daddy not to hurt her.”She said breaking down into tears covering her face with her hands.  Lipkins ordered a positive identification of the body knowing it was the doctor and she was trying to prove she was crazy. A few hours went by and the coroner confirmed the body they had was in deed that of Steven Drake a local vagrant. The detectives were floored.  She had been telling the truth after all.  “Why did he not kill you?” Havarro asked her who was of Cuban decent, his hair white, with the bluest eyes as he could not believe how sinister this doctor was, now where was he?  “Because I called 911 while he was killing everyone, I didn’t let Marcy out of the room until you guys were busting in the door and he went up in the crawl space of the attic.” She said with tears in her eyes thinking of those three beautiful little girls killed by their own father.  “Where is he now?” Lipkins asked fearing his killing spree was not over rubbing his reddish gray hair, he was short and stocky build where Havarro was tall and thin.   He watched her cross the street to her apartment, rubbing his cock as he imagined those full lips sucking his cock until his cum oozed out of the corner of her mouth, he was breathing hard as he followed across the street and into her apartment building. He watched as she was drunk and fumbled with the keys and now he was behind her, his hand was on the back of her head forcing her face into the door and smashing her nose. They were inside the apartment now as the door flew open with her face making contact. He laughed as she fell on the floor, he slammed the door and now his cock was in his hand. She turned over seeing what his intentions were and before she could scream his cock was in her mouth as she feared for her life. He fulfilled his fantasy and blew out her brains and then disappeared into the night.    Changes  ch 2     She lay on the cot of her cell knowing that she would be there until he was caught, she watched the spider making its web in the corner to catch its victim. Just like the doctor, she thought to herself. She was becoming restless being here for a week when she remembered back to the first session when it all began. . .  Marcy walked into his office dressed in a lavender sun dress with just a pair of lavender thongs and white sneakers. He began the session by having her lie on the couch after drinking a glass of special juice to help her relax and she entered into a cloudy existence that felt so peaceful that she went into a black void, Carol opened her eyes as the doctor had inserted his cock into the young pussy of Marcy’s that seemed to be a subject of rape and now here was Carol who had been sleeping since Marcy’s father died four years ago under the doctor and he felt her body giving into him, his desire to fuck her was now a reality and her body was eating him up like a man eater and she gushed her juices all over his cock as he filled her pussy with cum and she has been out and living ever since.  She lay on her cot and could still smell his sexual scent he had about him, her hand ran under her blue jeans as she spread her legs as she needed to have sex, she was going crazy from being locked up for her own protection until they caught him. At least she had her own cell and was able to shower when the rest of the population was in bed. Her fingers slid around her wet pussy as she remembered how he made her hot, filled with lust and at the same time she hated him and everything he represented. She remembered those hours filled fuck sessions with him and how he held her tiny waist with his two hands guiding her up and down on his cock so slow.....so deep that she bit her bottom lip until blood trickled slowly down her chin and he would lap it up as he sucked the blood from her punctured lip. Her hips moved her pussy harder against her fingers until she tasted that familiar taste and pain from her biting her lip once again as her pussy gushed its thick sweet juicy liquids from her clit with each contraction that pushed her cum out onto her fingers.   She knew it was haldol that he used to brain wash them along with him hypnotizing them with ideas and the shock treatments on top of it he created more personalities then just the original two, he created his own personal slaves. She succumbed to sleep with the sounds of the guards boots clicking on the high gloss polished floor outside of the cells. A tear trickled down her face for she had come to love all the personalties as her family and knew their deaths would follow once treatment began, even hers. Jaime the three year old emerged scared and lonely wanting her mommy to come rescue her from the dark cell with the sickening smell of the jail that filled her nostrils.  *Please mommy, please come get Jaime....I be good mommy.* she cried rolled up into a ball on the cot with the thin blanket pulled up over her and clutching the pillow like it was her teddy bear.* Don’t worry Sam I will hide you if that mean man comes in our room.* she whispered as she drifted off to sleep.  He stood across from the jail planning how he would get inside to get her out of that cell, he wanted to fuck her once more before he slit her throat like a swine and tasted that sweet blood as it trickled from her neck. The thought made his cock begin to twitch as he thought of her in slow motion coming down slowly on his cock, hearing that soft moan of hers that excited him even more. In his own sick demented way he loved her and really hated that he would have to kill her to silence her forever. He saw the police officer coming towards him and when he was close enough the Doctor shot him full of haldol and then dragged him into the alley where he stripped his uniform and he himself put it on.   Her eyes opened as she recognized those foot steps coming down the hall to her cell, her heart pounded with almost excitement and at the same time fear for she knew he was going to kill her. He stood at the door slowly placing the key into the lock and slowly turned the knob, he slowly pushed the door open and his eyes went immediately to her empty cot.

      EW Wants You by Erotica_Writings © Erotica Writings / Whispering_wolf57   I want to share this with you. I am standing in a room when I spot you checking out my body up and down. I could feel you undressing me in this room full of strangers and my heart feels like it will explode from the beating. You are now in front of me as I look at you wide eyed and so innocently as your finger touches my shoulder covered by this purple sequined dress, causing my flesh to break out in goose bumps. I began feeling out of control from your touch and wanting you, to feel you deep within me. I got to have you baby. I got to have your power deep inside of my wet pussy. I push you up against the wall looking deeply into your eyes with a slight smile to my purple glistening full lips.  The sound of erotic music is feeling the room as my body is pressed against yours and my hips are moving slowly side to side against your growing cock as I am steadily looking into your eyes. You hold my hands behind my back feeling my erect nipples rubbing against your chest and suddenly I have your hands up against the wall kissing your lips so very softly, licking them with my darting tongue. My purple thong is becoming wet as we are oblivious to anyone else around us.  Our hands drop to our sides as you kiss and suck on my neck causing more goose bumps to invade my flesh, my mouth is slightly opened from the pleasures that you are sending to my body with the touch of your lips. Your mouth finds my ear lobe kissing and sucking on it slowly as your hands are under my dress on my tight firm ass and I spread my legs still moving my hips slowly side to side. You squeeze my ass and a soft moan seeps from my lips. Your index finger has found the entrance to my ass and you slowly begin to enter it looking into my eyes as my pussy so desires that raging cock of yours.  The sound of the others whispering is driving me wild with desire and with my one hand breaking free from yours I release your throbbing cock and guide it to my hot, juicy pussy that is crying out to be fucked by you. Your cock feels so hard and stiff, as it slides deeper into my pussy and our hips are slowly grinding against each other, you turn me pressing my back against the wall  as my legs are tightly wrapped around your waist and with long hard thrust from your cock my pussy is covering it in my juices. Mmm do you like it baby? Close your eyes and feel my pussy sliding slowly over your cock drenching it with my creamy white juice, your cock is throbbing in my tight pussy and you ram your cock deeper and harder with long slow thrust of your hips pulsating cock that is fucking my pussy. I only want you to love me for this one night, this one moment in time. The room is silent during our lust-filled act of pure raw sex and I stare into those seductive eyes of you’re. Mmmmmm, gawd you feel so good, so hard as I try to take you deeper into my pussy that wants to cum all over your big hard cock baby.  You have me pinned tightly against the wall as you squeeze my tits so hard sending shivers throughout my body and the feeling is driving me wild as I kiss your neck, my arms are wrapped tightly around your shoulders and I am feeling the orgasm building deep within my pussy from your throbbing cock. Oh gawd its driving me crazy with desire, my pussy wants to suck your cock completely deeply inside of my hot throbbing cunt. Oh I am cuming.  I am cuming on that gorgeous cock of yours! Mmmmmm, Mmmmmm, mmm, mmm, Mmmmmm, Fuck me, fuck me oh gawd I can feel your hot cum exploding deep into my pussy! Mmm baby you make me feel so wild and untamable. I just hope it was just as good for you as it was for me. Mmmmm, come back to Erotica I have so much more I want to do to you to show you just how special you are to Erotica and you do want to make Erotica happy don’t you?

      A Fairy Tale by Erotica_Writings © A fairy tale of My Champion Lover  * * * * *  My champion lover stands in the moon light with just a pair of white baggy pants, he is shirtless and his tanned muscles can be seen rippling under the moons light. His hair is long, blonde and curly and his blue eyes can pierce my very soul. I listen to the drums of the music beating in the distance as the tropical music floats throughout the air. I stand before him in my long white sarong tied around my hips with a matching white bathing suit top tied around my neck and back. My hips began to move to my dance of seduction. Slowly dancing in circles around him, moving my hips in a steady sensual beat. I untied the back of my top and stood with my back against his chest, I felt his breathing so hard and the erection he pushed my ass up against.  I removed my top allowing it to drop onto the sandy shores as he kissed and sucked on the side of my neck while his hands searched my breast and my hips moved to a sensual beat never stopping, never missing a stroke of my hand over his hard cock behind me.  He lifts me up in his arms and we wade into the ocean waters that are still as glass and it looked like a perfect picture of a tropical night. The water was now up to his waist and his kisses are so inviting, he is caressing my breast as I wrapped my legs around him and under my sarong I feel my thong being ripped off, oh he takes me with such force, his long strides of his cock deep in my pussy, I wrap my arms and legs around him so much tighter feeling his cock throbbing inside of me and I feel so weightless as he was actually picking my body up and down by my waist as he rams my pussy on his rock hard cock.  I felt as if I could not get him in me any further, but I wanted that perfect cock in me, deeper, harder, I thought I was losing my mind from the desire spreading through my body like wild fire. And it happened the most powerful orgasm I had ever experienced in my whole entire life, my body was trembling, my eyes rolled in the back of my eyes and when he brought me down on his cock for the last time I felt the biggest explosion erupt from my pussy and all over his cock.  I watched his face once I regained my composure, his jaw was so tight, his nostrils were flaring and then his teeth gritted tightly as the his veins in his neck began to bulge and throb, he moans my name from his lips so loudly as he came deep into my pussy.  I laid my head on his broad shoulder and kissed his neck and with one sudden shove into the water I was falling down into the black murky waters. I couldn't stop going down my arms and legs were thrashing all over in the water trying to stop me and then lightening bolts went through my body transforming me into a mermaid. When I came up to greet my lover, he had transformed into King Neptune of the sea with a long white beard, we need to discuss a diet because he has gotten a bit of a stomach. He calls me to pleasure him by a fog horn and when I enter his under water castle he waits for me with his cock out wanting me to suck it as he has it between my breast licking his head between my large breast, and he grabs the back of my hair and he rams my head up and down making my mouth go further down on his hard cock, and it is hitting the back of my throat so hard as saliva runs out of the corner of my mouth from his constant ramming of my head up and down on his cock. My eyes watered from the pressure of the cock in my mouth and then his hot thick white cum shoots down the back of my throat and I had to swallow hard or I would have choked on his cock.  Mmmm the sun feels so good on my beautiful purple tail, I brush my long hair on my favorite rock while waiting for some ships to come so I may play my sirens song while waiting for Neptune to summons me for another romp under the sea.

      Just Once More by Erotica_Writings ©  I sit silently in the dimly lit room, looking around at the room I shared last night of wild sex with the nameless stranger who lay in the bed beside me.  It was really great sex that I have to admit, I remember the erotic music the band played at the lounge and the tall dark stranger who asked me to dance. He was so handsome with his milk chocolate skin against my skin of ivory, His white suit, with the red silk shirt made him look even darker as his large hands caressed my back under the black silk dress that I wore that was cut low over my breast.  His body moved in a slow sensual movement against mine, our breathing was becoming as if it were one. I felt that same tingling sensation run through my body like the call of the wild wanting to mate. My pussy was becoming wet between my thighs, I tried to fight these urges before and tonight isn't any different I am giving into the lust of this stranger.  He kisses my neck as he holds me close to his body, his hands roam up and down my back rubbing my ass as we danced. He turns me so my back is against him, running his hands down my sides slowly, down the sides of my thigh and back up almost exposing my body by lifting the side of my dress half way. His full lips were so soft on my neck, my nipples were erect and his finger tips gave me goose bumps on my flesh and before I knew it we were leaving and checked into a motel where he used his tie to restrain my hands to the head board, he then removed my thong and roughly he parted my legs and confined them with the sheets so I was his sexual prisoner.  He sat cross my hips and began to pinch and twist my nipples that were erect and hard. The burning sensation in my nipple made my pussy ache more for him, he began to tease me by standing beside the bed and he removed his clothing slowly, twisting my nipple every once in awhile after sucking on them and he would smack my ass cheek every so often. He then sat across my chest now his large cock teased my lips as it softly slid across my lips as my tongue darted out to taste the salty clear liquid that began to ooze from its tip. I began to suck on his hard cock like a lolly pop twirling the head in my mouth wanting to feel his hot cum shoot down my throat.  Instead he stopped and stood across the room lighting a candle. I was breathing heavy wanting to feel his massive cock inside of me, my skin tingling from the hot lust that is flowing through me. I wanted to fuck him in the worse way. He stood over me dripping the hot candle wax on my nipples and down my stomach, the burning sensation felt so good on my hot skin, I wanted him and this pain he inflicted upon me was driving me crazy, I felt his thumb on my clit as he dripped more wax on my flesh, my hips were grinding up against his thumb, my pussy was throbbing with desire and then I felt his huge cock enter my pussy hard and he moaned as he entered my wet pussy as my juices welcomed him. He grinded his hard cock deep with in me, he untied one of my hands and I slowly dripped the candle wax down his back and on his ass checks, he pinned my hands down onto the bed.  "You want to cum on my cock slut?" he asked as he fucked me harder.  "Oh yes, I want to cum all over your cock." I told him as he bit my nipple a little harder each time.  He moved up on his knees moving me up on his lap taking me deeper onto his large cock as my hips grinded against him to achieve the orgasm I was ready to beg for. He twisted my nipples with his one hand when I felt his finger slide into my ass and he fingered me bringing me into the most explosive orgasm anyone had ever given me. I felt him shoot his hot cum deep inside of my pussy from his throbbing hard cock. We both laid quietly on the bed side by side not speaking just listening to our breathing in the dim lit room.  He looked at me smiling as his fingers moved my hair from my face. He ran his finger down my nude body smiling at me.  "So what is your name?" he asked me.  I looked at him as I sat on the side of the bed shaking my head. He looked at me confused with my sudden distance. I touched his chin softly with my finger tips.  "No names, it will only ruin it." I told him dressing and leaving him still a stranger as I did to everyone of my lovers.

You always blow a kiss to that skinny bitch Fran. Well tonight I have plans for you, ah lets say this will become very explosive. Five to five and as routine you begin cleaning off your desk, smell the rose tossing it into the trash. You now adjust your tie, stand up putting on your black jacket which looks great with those white slacks, run your hands through your hair. . .just like clock work.   I leave following you and once again you do not notice me behind you in my car, I even park next to you, look over at you and you hurriedly get out of your car. Thinking you will be meeting the that red headed slut for drinks in an hour in your apartment. If you only knew it will be me standing on the other side of the door. You never even noticed that I live right across from you, you never noticed me as I sun bathed across from your lounger at the pool. Tonight you will notice me, lets just say you won’t be able to escape.  Unlocking my door, walking down the hallway to my bathroom as I drop my clothes behind me leaving a trail from the front door to the bathroom, turning on the water, yes nice and hot to burn my skin to make it tingle and my nips become hard. Oh my the soap feels wonderful going over my hard swollen nipples, both hands caressing my breast, oh my pussy is wet and is excited that tonight you will have your cock deep inside of it. I want to cum, but no I will cum on your cock.  I pick my leather teddy that fits my body tightly, I pull my fishnet thigh high stockings up my legs and then placing the twelve inch spiked heels on my feet, I pull my blonde hair up in a pony tail with a leather scrunchie and then begin to apply my black eye liner thickly, my red glossy lip stick and my tabu perfume behind my ears, the finale touch is my leather choker. I walk out of the bedroom and down the hall to the front door.  I am now standing in front of your door with my bag of goodies. I ring the doorbell and you answer it wearing a pair of black satin lounge pants with a matching shirt and bare feet.   Your surprised to see me at your door and even more surprised when I push you back into the apartment handing you the rose and the candy kiss. You try to yell, but I hold up a picture of you with your hand stealing money from pay roll. You ask me what do I want, I tell you take the rose and eat the kiss. Your surprised to learn that it has been me giving you the rose and candy for the last year. Your face shows your fear, I smile as you ask me what is it that I want? I now have my flogger pointing at your chest as I push you slowly backwards into your own bedroom where I intend to rape you.  You sit obediently on the bed as instructed and I open my bag with cuffs, shackles and chains, I chain you to your own bed and then cut off your pants with my razor, you smile when you realize I am going to suck your cock to get you hard and I roll your cock slowly around my mouth as I kneel between your thighs looking you seriously in your eyes. The pain of me squeezing your balls tightly makes your cock so hard in my mouth and you moan. I sit up and swing the flogger across your cock and you grimace with pain, but your cock twitches wanting more. I pull my cd player out and play my music so I may strip in front of you as I watch you smile enjoying this torture I am putting you through.  I pinch my nipples as I straddle you, I then place my fingers in my wet pussy and reaching behind me I rub my juices over your hard cock. I place my fingers back into my pussy gathering up more of my thick white creamy juices and rub my fingers over your mouth and make you suck them clean. The thought that she ate the kiss she found on her desk just before she left work thinking it was from you is making me even more wet knowing she has just taken her last breath. I place clothes pins on your nipples and bite your throat feeling that hard throbbing cock going deep inside of me and my pussy sucks it deeper and I moan as you too feel such a rise in this heat filled passion of fucking lust, my hands are firmly on your chest covered in my black leather gloves that goes to my elbows and my pussy pounds your cock harder and harder, deeper and deeper until we both explode into the others juices and our moaning intensifies as we fucking cum over and over. I look down at you and whisper in your ear. . .  “What away to go.” I whisper in your ear as you struggle for air and then close your eyes to go to sleep for eternity. “Night, night baby.”

      A Naughty EW By Erotica Writings    I am feeling quite naughty today and I am in the mood to play. Do you want to play with EW? What am I wearing? Just my perfume baby as I lay stretched out on my lounging float in my pool and the sun is warming my erect nipples and my shaved pussy. Mmm I hear the neighbor trying to peek over the fence to catch a glimpse of my nude body. Mmm think I will give him a show to watch today. I will start by rubbing both nipples in between my two thumbs and pointer fingers. Mmm feels good and the thought of him watching me play with my tits is making my pussy moist. Oh yes this is really turning me on.  I am actually giving myself goose bumps as my finger nail runs slowly down my stomach As I can hear him propping himself up on the fence for a better view and I take my finger in a circle just above my pussy and I slowly prop my left open as my finger seeks the white creamy juice that is coming from inside of my pink pussy that I know he wants to stick that huge cock inside of. Mmm this really feels sexy, I am spreading both of my legs as wide as I can and moving my hips in a slow sensual circular hard grind.  Oh my pussy is so wet that my fingers are moving slowly in and out of my pulsating pussy. I can feel my pussy contracting and building a powerful suction as if it is going to suck my finger up inside of it. Mmm my other hand is grabbing my breast hard while I am pinching and twisting my nipples. Ahhhh my clit is so swollen and I can hear him breathing hard over my chimes blowing in the breeze, perhaps he is masturbating on the other side of the fence, Oh shit that is so hot to think of him masturbating with me.  Um come fuck my pussy baby, come give my that big hard cock that is throbbing with hot passionate lust filled desire to fuck my pussy hard, and deep. Um deeper, harder, Um Baby my finger is rubbing my pussy so hard as I try to spread my legs even wider knocking my glass of wine off into the water and causing waves from my hips thrashing in the lounger as I arch my back and push my pussy up to the sky to make sure he has a great eye full of my white thick creamy juices soaking my pussy and fingers. I am almost there, just moments away from climaxing when I hear his dog barking I hear several men voices now sneering and then quiet as I have not stopped trying to get the orgasm that my pussy very much wants. Somehow the thought of him and his group of friends watching me turns me on even more and I hear myself saying “mmmm You boys want this pussy of mine to fuck don’t you? You want to ram your hard cocks deep into my delicious tight pussy that is full of creamy white thick juices caused by my clit that is so swollen and hard. Mmmm oh fuck, fuck I am going to cum, I am going to cum so hard, mmmm” Then I hear loud moaning as I pinch and twist my nipples, oh it feels really, really good, oh shit I am almost there, my pussy wants one of those guys to come and fuck me! Fuck my fucking pussy, my hips are thrashing and waves are forming in the pool, my teeth are closed tightly as my fingers are into my pussy and , my breathing is so powerful that when my pussy explodes its hot juices all over my fingers, my thumb in on my clit and my hips are thrashing wild like a bucking horse as I moan out loud like a wild animal in heat. Mmmmmm fuck me, fuck me.  I am cuming! Mmm, mmm, mmm, oooohhhh yesssssssssss mmmmmm oh baby!  I was totally exhausted as I lay on my water lounger smiling with the thought of those strange men Jacking off together on their fence while they were watching me stroking my pussy. Ha, ha oh what a lovely afternoon and y’all have a nice day and perhaps we can do something different next week? Mmmm so relaxed.

       “Monica”-  by Erotica Writings  Hi I am Monica and this our regular Tuesday night girl’s night out that we spend at the movies. Tonight we went to the xxx movies, oh my . . .  my cheeks felt like they were so feverish when I handed the balding perverted fifty years old man my money as his eyes were glued to my large breast, I am a bodacious beauty at 175 pounds. We walked into the darkened room where there were a few couples and a few who were not with a couple. The four of us sat in front of the large screen, crossing our legs and fixing our skirts like ladies. Nancy sat at one end and Maria at the other end with Kelly and me sandwiched between them. The movie started out slowly and then my eyes were glued to a large pulsating cock throbbing before me on the screen, I could see the veins pulsating in this magnificent cock that entered the juicy pussy that was secreting white cream from the opening.  He had her pinned against the wall fucking her harder and harder until I could almost feel that great cock inside of my now wet steamy pussy. I even had a perverse thought of visiting the perverted man at the ticket desk. I began to squirm in my seat, I noticed I was breathing heavy and then I felt the warm hand on my thigh moving up under my skirt and forcing my legs to open up, I felt Nancy's fingers pushing my thighs to the side as her fingers found my thick, sticky sweet juices and began massaging my swollen clit, I looked over at my other friends biting my lips from the pressure she was giving my swollen clit when I saw each of their hands were busy on the other one as well. I thought I should be doing the same thing to Nancy, but she stopped me when I moved my hand toward her lap. She masturbated the two of us and I gripped the arms of my seat feeling the pressure of the climax building, and then I moaned so sultry just as the actress moaned out in the movie. Nancy licked her fingers clean of my juices and then let me clean her sweet nectar off of her other fingers. I had never been with a woman before and when we all left we left as friends, in the back seat of Maria's car Nancy was like a boy on a date stealing kisses from me and her hand going under my shirt finding my hardened nipples and then her mouth found them. Maria pulled up in front of Nancy's and Nancy led me out of the car and up to her apartment. She handed me a glass of wine and we walked to her bedroom where she slowly removed my shirt unbuttoning one button at a time, she took both of her hands placing them on each side of my breast and kissing the tops of my flesh.   I could feel my heart beating when she unsnapped my bra allowing it to fall to the floor and I heard her moan when she sucked on my nipple. My head fell back as I enjoyed the sensations her mouth gave my breast and my pussy. She removed the rest of my clothes and helped me on the bed. I wondered where she was going when she walked from the bed to her closet, I watched her remove her clothes and then I saw it, she strapped on a double headed vibrator and was back at the bed on top of me, kissing me passionately, then she gagged my mouth with some sort of device with a strap.  She shoved me more into the bed as her hands explored my body and then I felt it enter my hot steamy pussy and I was in heaven as she worked her magical pulsating cock in our pussy's and we both grinded hard against the other, almost becoming animalistic in our love making, she bit my shoulder which made me more hot, more juicy, she grabbed my wrist pinning them down to the bed over my head, still biting into my flesh, and then it happened as our bodies were in perfect union with the other one the explosion of a life time over came us and almost caused me to black out. The room was spinning and I felt our quivering bodies succumbing to the orgasms. I didn’t think I could moan so loud. We lay in the bed falling to sleep in each other's arms and tomorrow we go back to our selves, married to wonderful men who might like to join us on Saturday night.

      Kane In memory of Mike  By Erotica Writings     Bikers do not have attitudes, stupid people piss them off. Don’t start with your snide remarks until I have finished my story first. Christmas time the bikers ride down the interstate carrying gifts tied to their bikes, or when a member has fallen they make sure the family left behind is well-taken care of and this begins my story.  Mike was such a loving man and reminded me of Dan Haggerty, the actor who played Grizzly Adams with his love for children and animals. I was twenty four when he walked into mine and my children’s lives. I was at home alone when there was a knock on the door and it was my step brother Jim with his friend. I could not help but notice how attractive he was with his black hair, full beard and the bluest eyes I had ever seen in my entire life. They came in waking up my three daughters and filling them with soda and cookies. I could not take my eyes off of him and yes I was married to a real bastard at the time. He saw more female strippers then he saw his family and actually I was glad when he did not come home because that meant I would not have any black eyes.  I can still recall the last beating I received from him as if it were yesterday, I was in the condo’s laundry room washing our clothes and folding them when Jack walked in and grabbed me by the back of my hair and slammed my face into the dryer door. I could feel the blood seeping from my forehead and nose caused from the impact of flesh meeting metal, I was dizzy and could hear my girls screaming for daddy to stop hurting mommy. I tried to make my cries sound like laughter so not to scare my daughters anymore then what their father had just done. Everything happened so fast, the laundry door flying open and seeing Jim standing there in shock seeing my face gushing blood and I heard Mikes voice yelling out.  “You mother fucker!” he yelled as he grabbed my husband Jack.  I tried to stop him, but Jack had Mike by the throat and Jim was grabbing my girls out of harms way. Jack put his elbow into my face breaking my nose that it was pulverized. Then I saw Jack being lifted in the air by Mike and smashed into the dryer door and a very loud thud, then a grunt as his body collapsed onto the ground. Mike had me in his arms kissing my bloody face mixed in with my tears.  The superintendent had the police out there where they removed Jack in hand cuffs and I was taken to the hospital to be released two days later after they reconstructed my nose. My girls were all happy with Jim, his girl friend Macy and Mike, Thanksgiving was just a couple days away and my home smelt of pumpkin cookies, pies, decorated for the big feast with fall colors and Mike looked so handsome in his black Harley T-shirt, jeans and bikers boots. His smile was that of a devilish little boy that melted my heart.  “Welcome home Ginger.” Mike said hugging me as my sister helped me into the house due to my vision being blurry from the swelling and bruising of my eyes.  My heart felt like it would beat right out of my chest, as I felt like a sixteen-year-old girl with her first crush. They stayed with us to make sure we were safe and during this time Mike and I became very close in those six months, in fact we were planning our wedding just as soon as my divorce was finale in three weeks.   Then it happened as I was sitting in the apartment waiting for Jim, Mike and his brother Sammy to come in from work, Macy was playing with the girls and then my phone rang and I heard my brothers voice crying.  “You need to get to the hospital.  They were run down.” He cried into the phone.  I held the phone to my ear for the longest time before I hung up, tears streaked my face as I looked at Macy and my girls.  “Macy call momma and ask her to watch the girls, Mike and Sammy have been hurt tonight.” I told her walking numbly to my room to put on my shoes.  It seemed like everything moved in slow motion, I moved in slow motion as my brain was trying to deny that facts. We sat in the surgical waiting room, Mike died seven times that night, seven times that night my heart shattered for my beloved. I rocked back and forth, back and forth until the doctor allowed me to go into the ICU room that my beloved man laid fighting for his life. The weeks turned into months’ for Mike and Sammy on their road to recovery. The night before Mike was to be released after six months in the hospital Jack showed up at the apartment stopping me in the parking lot where he stabbed me in my head, over and over trying to kill me in front of my little girls. I blacked out and woke up in the recovery room with machines’ attached to me. Mike was released the next day, but Sammy had to stay another six weeks.  I was released a week later, Jack was never caught for his crime and has not been seen or heard of since the attack. My father moved me and the girls up to Sebring, Florida where I lived waiting for my beloved to join me in the small country house. We would visit each other on the week ends and A year to the date of the accident that changed Mike’s life I received a visit from my brother Jim who had joined us up in Sebring so he and Macy could raise a family.  “Ginger, Sammy just called and he . . .  “ He broke down into tears before he could finish his sentence.  I knew something horrible had happened to Mike. Tears wailed up in my eyes and my head began shaking no, no, because I did not want to hear what he was going to tell me! My hands went over my ears as I began to twirl in a circle and he grabbed me.  “Don’t you dare tell me something is wrong with Mike?” I cried out feeling fear eat my soul quickly.  “Damn it don’t make this any harder, he went to bed last night and never woke up, damn it Ginger! He died in his sleep.” He told me as he took me into his arms holding me as my body shook from my heart crumbling into a thousand pieces.  “No! No!” I wailed into the silence of the room as Macy had my children outside and their heads turned toward the house when they heard my cries.   I gave birth to an eight-pound baby girl six months later That I named Michelle after her father. He gave me part of him to still be able to hold and love. I love you Mike and always will “Forever and A Day.”     *This is not a true story and the characters are fictional, any resemblance is pure coincidence.

      My Erotic Mind & Howard Stern by Erotica_Writings ©  Oh Howard how I am going to hurt you tonight, I am going to run my fingers through those long black locks of yours in my mind. I watch you on my T.V. set and as soon as I hear that sexy voice of yours, oh boy, my panties become wet from my tingling pussy and as I lie on my bed watching you with just my thongs on and my fingers twist my hard large pink nipples causing the wetness in my thongs to become almost sticky and the tingling is turning into throbs because my pussy aches for your cock to go deep inside of my tight pink pussy.  My middle finger slowly goes in the crotch of my thong finding the hot sweet juices of my pussy and listening to your so sexy voice, that laughter, oh my pussy becomes so wet, contracting listening to your laughter. Oh my nipples are so hard Howard. I want your tongue to lick my swollen clit lapping up the excess juices. Oh yes I watch how your mouth moves on the set and think of you between my thighs, holding my thrashing hips down with both of your arms wrapped around my thighs, you slowly take your tongue so lightly to my clit driving me crazy and then every once in a while slipping in a hard suck on my clit. My fingers dig into the sides of the bed, I am almost holding my breath as you tease my hot, throbbing tight, juicy pussy.  “Oh please, Howard, please give it to me harder!” I plead to the T.V. set wanting your tongue so much harder on my cunt.  My hands are now on both sides of your head holding your head against my pussy and then I feel your tongue hard on my clit and your sucking it as you drink my sweet nectar and I scream out so loud as my pussy explodes it's juices all over your face.  “Fuck me! Fuck me Howard!” I scream out into my room watching you smile on my set. Gawd how you send me to depths, I have never explored before.  I turn over and go to sleep to be woken by your voice in my ear from your radio show, I smile waking up to you and feel the tingling again in my pussy once again and decide this morning to fuck you as I grab my dildo from the night stand and insert it into my hot wet pussy, I want to ride you now so I place the dildo under me as I straddle it as I squat spread legs on my knees and I take you into my pussy sitting on your cock, my hands on my pillow to hold me up and I grind my hips harder down on your cock and take you as deep as I can feel your cock rubbing against my clit and my pussy explodes all over your big hard cock, “Howard!,Oh Howard fuck me baby, fuck me!” I place my dildo to my lips licking off my juices thinking it’s your cock.  A week has gone by since my last fantasy of Howard and a few of my friends talked me into going to a concert and there he is standing before me in the crowds watching the same concert I am watching! My knees become so weak and the only ones I am aware of around me is him, it’s like everyone else disappears that was there and he turns slowly toward me as I stand there wide eyed scared to move, smile or blink. He holds his hand out to me and I walk up to him as he is dressed all in black and looks at me over his dark gold rim sun glasses smiling as he pulls me up against his body.  My heart I think it will explode from beating so hard, I feel his hands going up under my short black velvet dress and on my bare ass as my thong is becoming soaked from him. I close my eyes and feel his lips on mine, running softly down my neck back up to my ears that is causing goose bumps all over my body. He is unbuttoning his pants now and puts both hands on my shoulders for me to kneel in front of him and I take his hard cock into my mouth, I begin to choke because he is so huge he is gagging me and saliva begins to run out of my mouth onto his cock as my eyes begin to water. He has my hair wrapped around his hand and begins to ram my head harder onto his cock and down my throat, letting me rest just long enough to spit some saliva on his cock and then back to bobbing and sucking on his cock.  He then grabs me and forces me to lean over the back of a chair as he moves my thong to the side and smacks my ass so hard that it brings tears to my eyes and nipple erections to my breast. I feel him slide his hard cock deep into my pussy and fingering my pussy so fast and hard that we both exploded in a huge orgasm that almost dropped us to our knees as I could feel his body become heavy on my back as we moaned from the fucking pleasure.  “So did you enjoy the concert?” I heard a man’s voice ask me.  I Looked up and there he was Howard Fucking Stern! With a smile on my face and a twinkle in my eye. “Very much so and I hope it was as good for you as it was for me. I left the concert that night . . . I know you want to know if I finally fucked him in reality . . .  A lady never kisses and tells.

      The Doll Maker - by Erotica Writings  Lydia sat in her wheel chair making her dolls that she took to the market every Saturday to sell. She designed her dolls to be the way she wished she could be, she made leather clothing with silver studs, and she dressed them as sexy as she her self wanted to be while fantasizing about men wanting her as badly as she wanted to be wanted. She sewed them all with love and the desire she had burning deep in her soul.  It was the night before Halloween and the clock struck midnight Lydia laid sound a sleep when a gold glittering fog lingered over the dolls, with lightening striking from side to side of the house. Lydia’s eyes opened slowly as she saw all her dolls standing around her bed and on top of her pulling to get her up. She was frightened as her long brown hair fell loosely around her shoulders and she saw her self in her dresser mirror dressed just as her doll’s in a long black leather skirt with fringe on it, the top was cut low over her breast.  She saw her legs covered in thigh high boots and she stood up smiling forgetting her wheel chair and magically began walking. She followed the dolls out of her house as they ran down the road on legs that never could move before. She walked up to a bar with Harleys parked all over the lot. Her heart was pounding from this new found freedom. She walked past men and women who watched this creature of beauty passing them with her friends who was just as gorgeous.  Lydia looked at her dolls who were just as human as she was, they laughed and danced. Robert walked into the room it had been awhile since he had been back in the states living in the Caribbean for six years, He saw her standing there with her friends, he felt a warming in his loins and walked over to her.  “Would you like a drink?” he asked smiling so charming at her.  Her eyes sparkled when she looked into his dark brown eyes; his short brown hair looked completely in place, He was tan, but his chiseled features did not go with his biker attire of black leather vest, black jeans, shirtless, with silver chains and black leather wrist bands, his black boots with the silver chains caught her eyes they were so shiny. She felt a warm tingling sensation fill her body.  “Yes, thanks.” She said smiling.  A few drinks they were all very relaxed. She watched him go into the bathroom and then followed to the door knocking softly on it.  “I’ll be out in a minute!” He bellowed through the door.  “It’s Lydia, may I come in?” she asked  He opened the door so she could slip inside falling into his arms kissing his lips hungrily as his hands roamed her body. He turned her around with her back against him, he softly kissed her neck sucking so slowly, his hands ran up her thighs raising her dress up over her tight firm ass and began to squeeze each cheek as his mouth worked on her neck and shoulder kissing and biting her flesh causing her to moan out from the pain mixed with a tingling pleasure that he was giving her.  Her hands lay softly around the back of his neck as he moved his hand in between her thighs moving her thong slightly to side and placing his finger into her warm soft, juicy pussy that was throbbing from the desire he gave her. Her hand ran down her chest to breast caressing them with her eyes closed, her lips slightly parted open and he bent her over the sink filling her juicy sweet pussy up with his thick hard throbbing cock, her fingers found her clit as his cock thrust deeper and deeper into her pussy, her fingers were becoming soaked with her juices secreting from her pussy over his cock as well.  His cock glided smoothly with a steady rhythm in and out, his veins were popping out of his neck as well as his forehead, his fingers clinched into her flesh on her hips as he rammed his cock deeper and harder into her pussy. She began to tremble as the sweet, sweet ecstasy took over her and her hands caresses and twisted her nipples until she moaned from the pleasures searing through her body and his as their juices mingled together deep into her tight pussy that dripped from their orgasm as well as her virgin blood.  Now only their breathing could be heard as they stood quietly from the greatest sensation either had experienced in their entire lives. She wanted more, she became like a drug addict wanting more sex he pushed her to her knees where she grabbed his hips taking his still throbbing cock into her mouth tasting both of their juices, she licked and tongued his hard cock, rolling it around her in mouth hearing him moan, feeling his cock growing in her mouth, his fingers wrapping tightly around her hair as he began to shove his cock deeper and harder down her throat until she began to choke on his cock from its force hitting the back of her throat, he quickly sat on the toilet seat having her straddle him sucking his thick hard cock up in to wet pussy, she grinded her hips down on him harder and harder until she began to scream from the orgasm that rocked her entire body with almost violent trembles this time and he swore her eyes glowed purple. It had to be the alcohol and the fact that it was actually after midnight and Halloween.  They walked out of the bathroom and people were laying all over the floor bloodied, she turned to look at him when he grabbed her sinking his teeth in her neck and draining her of her blood as the dolls were feasting as well. Lydia was now part of the creatures of the night as well as the rest of the patrons at the bar. Had Lydia unwittingly created her fate with her dolls?

He had her pinned against the wall fucking her harder and harder until I could almost feel that great cock inside of my now wet steamy pussy. I even had a perverse thought of visiting the perverted man at the ticket desk. I began to squirm in my seat, I noticed I was breathing heavy and then I felt the warm hand on my thigh moving up under my skirt and forcing my legs to open up, I felt Nancy's fingers pushing my thong to the side as her fingers found my thick, sticky sweet juices and began massaging my swollen clit, I looked over at my other friends biting my lips from the pleasure she was giving me when I saw each of their hands were busy on the other one as well.  I thought I should be doing the same thing to Nancy, but she stopped me when I moved my hand towards her lap. She masturbated the two of us and I gripped the arms of my seat feeling the pressure of the climax building, and then I moaned so sultry just as the actress moaned out in the movie. Nancy licked her fingers clean of my juices and then let me clean her sweet nectar off of her other fingers.  I had never been with a woman before and when we all left we left as friends, in the back seat of Maria's car Nancy was like a boy on a date stealing kisses from me and her hand going under my shirt finding my hardened nipples and then her mouth found them. Maria pulled up in front of Nancy's and Nancy led me out of the car and up to her apartment. She handed me a glass of wine and we walked to her bedroom where she slowly removed my shirt unbuttoning one button at a time, she took both of her hands placing them on each side of my breast and kissing the tops of my flesh.  I could feel my heart beating when she unsnapped my bra allowing it to fall to the floor and I heard her moan when she sucked on my nipple. My head fell back as I enjoyed the sensations her mouth gave my breast and my pussy. She removed the rest of my clothes and helped me on the bed.  I wondered where she was going when she walked from the bed to her closet, I watched her remove her clothes and then I saw it, she strapped on a double headed vibrator and was back at the bed on top of me, kissing me passionately, then she gagged my mouth with some sort of device with a strap.  She shoved me more into the bed as her hands explored my body and then I felt it enter my hot steamy pussy and I was in heaven as she worked her magical pulsating cock in our pussy's and we both grinded hard against the other, almost becoming animalistic in our love making, she bit my shoulder which made me more hot, more juicy, she grabbed my wrist pinning them down to the bed over my head, still biting into my flesh, and then it happened as our bodies were in perfect union with the other one the explosion of a life time over came us and almost caused me to black out. The room was spinning and I felt our quivering bodies succumbing to the orgasms. I didn’t think I could moan so loud.  We lay in the bed falling to sleep in each other's arms and tomorrow we go back to our selves, married to wonderful men who might like to join us on Saturday night.

Ouch he is cutting my throat and sucking my blood? Oh I don’t care he has me; I want more and more of him. His sucking of my blood feels so good; his hands caressing my breast and nipples are driving me as wild as him slowly moving his hard erection in and out of me slowly, teasingly.  Oh suck my neck more sweet man its driving me wild, I am so hot, so wet between my thigh’s, his lips have a red hint on them from the blood he sips from my neck. He seems to be relishing the sweet juices of my blood flowing in between his lips. My nipples are so hard and swollen like my clit, my body wants to feel the great waves of the orgasm building deep with in my very soul, oh I am going to explode as I feel his hard erection throbbing inside of me, slowly going deeper, yes so slow and harder, deeper, I can feel both of our throbbing organs and the mixture of heavy breathing.  Oh yes, yes, Mmmm Mmmm I am coming, yes! My nails dig into his flesh on his back as he sends me pass cloud nine. He moans from the release of his hot fluids deep inside of me. We lay without saying a word to each other we just lie in the silence and pure ecstasy of the hot blood pumping sex we just had shared. His hand is now on his shaft rubbing it to get it erect again.  He takes the ring he has been using to cut my neck with its sharp point and slowly slices his erection then takes my hand rubbing his ever so stiff erection with it and his blood oozes on to my hand and fingers, his breathing becomes intense, he is moaning in my ear. He cuts my breast and licks the blood off of it hungrily, he licks his blood from my hand and sits across my chest with his erection touching my lips, his blood is running across my chest and his balls are tucked securely under my chin and neck. I lick and suck at his erection quickly and eagerly to  Be filled with his hot thick juices into my mouth and down my throat. I don’t want this to end with him; I have never felt so sensual in my whole twenty years of experiencing sex. He has unleashed a dormant side of me.  He comes so hard, so deep in my mouth, his moans telling me just how much I satisfied him and yes I am proud of myself. He falls onto the bed on his back and pulls me on top of him. With his hand holding the back of my head and his fingers wrapped with in the strands his tongue probes my mouth and I suck his tongue wanting more, more give me more!  His hands are exploring my body, and one finger goes in my ass as his erection is back and he begins to explore the inside of my heat filled body. My breathing is heavy as he drinks the blood from my breast and I ride him in a slow circular motion, taking him deeper and deeper until we both scream out in a sweet delicious powerful orgasm. We are breathless and he is still so handsome, so sexual with the blood and sweat mixing together. We lay silently not saying a word just staring into each others eyes.  There is this annoying noise in my ear, I turn over in the bed and it’s my alarm clock, damn I was dreaming! It felt so real and I am even sticky between my thighs. Well it’s time to get up and go to work. The shower will feel so good on me this morning. Damn it!

      You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings ©  CHAPTER 1  Why do I constantly set that stupid alarm clock? Because I am a coward to take the day off. Oh by the way good morning I am Montana Jacobs and you'll be assigned to me and my partner Austin Tyler. Warning he isn't too happy that I was assigned as his partner so be prepared for some very hostile remarks towards me. Excuse my night clothes I have had this huge T - shirt since I graduated from the academy it was actually black before the thousands of washings I have given it. Ah coffee thanks you're a life saver. We wear black T - shirts, black slacks, black combat boots just in case I need to kick my way out of a situation, and a black cap that holds this dreadful long hair up. No I am not a true blond in case you're wondering. Alright I am going to go shower and dress for work and we will be on our way.  I hope I didn't keep you waiting to long, one day I hope to get issued a new car, I have had this white one for a while now. A nice little red one would be very nice. It is not a crime to dream. Anyway we are almost there; Austin is very good looking and knows it. He is divorced and has more girlfriends than Carter has Peanuts. Interested in him? Lord no, he likes him self too much for me to even like him a little. He constantly walks around combing his hair which is black and I pray every night he gets one gray hair to totally mess him up. He has great blue eyes, but wears green contacts, he runs everyday, but he is flabby. Boy he would kill me if he heard our conversation. Yeah he's pretty tall six something and thin not really flabby maybe he just has that middle age bulge that men get. How old is he? Um has to be late thirties, early forties? I will be forty two in August, and no I have never been married for a long time; only two men ever made the earth tremble under my feet.  Well we're here, you ready? Here we go, follow me. This is the lobby and that is Tommy Redding and Hannah Tooley at the information desk, they have been on the force for twenty years, anything you need to know they can answer your question. The office to your right belongs to Sheriff Conrad's and three doors down is our office. The tall blond in the sheriff's uniform is my room mate and best friend Ariana Philip. We both wear size seven tall, and have the same problem finding bathing suit tops to fit our well endowed bust. Being top heavy has its draw backs. OK here we are and hopefully he is not here yet. No luck for us today he is here waiting impatiently. I remember the first day I met him, sit down at my desk and I will tell you the story. Would you like some coffee? Great, cream and sugar? Now the story, hold on to your seat tightly.  It was a bright sunny day last summer, and I am excited to be starting a new line of police work. I report to Lieutenant Rydell's office to meet my new partner Austin Tyler his mouth dropped when he saw me and I was flattered until he used it to speak with. "A woman! My partner is a damned woman? Why are you doing this to me?" he asked the Lieutenant.  "Calm down Austin she is very qualified and you won't get a better partner." He told him. The Lieutenant a large man of African descent in his early fifties, his hair graying on the sides with a thick mustache and weighing two hundred fifty pounds on his six foot five frame.  "Really?" he said then tried to grab me in a head lock before I could tell him I was a four time black belt in martial arts I ended up showing him by placing him on the floor with my boot on his throat stretching his arm with my hands. He was beyond angry; it was pure contempt.  We had to go to Port Everglades in Florida the agents had been watching a certain ship and we got word that this was the day they were shipping in over a one billion dollar shipment of cocaine. The ship came out of Brazil. There were over a dozen of us when we raided the ship confiscating their large shipment of cocaine that would have hit the streets of South Florida. As we boarded the ship Austin and I were going through the ship when this huge male Brazilian decided he wasn't going peacefully, he grabbed Austin around the neck holding a gun to his temple. My heart is beating out of my chest now; I held my gun on him. "Let my partner go or I will shoot." I told him as beads of perspiration were forming on my top lip.  The huge giant laughed. "Go to hell bitch and say good bye to your partner." He yelled pulling the trigger back on his gun.  I fired shooting the man between the eyes; he fell on top of Austin knocking them both down to the ground, both laid there silently. I thought Austin was killed, he lay very still and he had a man over six feet and weighed four hundred pounds if not more on top of him.  Austin's hands clenched into two fists and he grunted in almost a whisper. "Don't just stand there get him off of me!" Austin told me while he squinted his eyes from the man's weight on top of him.  I helped to move the large man's body off of him. Austin looked at me with so much hate I thought he was going to shoot me with his hand on his gun.  "Why did you wait so long in firing?" He yelled getting to his feet." He was going to kill me! What are you having a hormonal imbalance and couldn't decide?" he yelled at me.  "He didn't kill you, and I had to give him a chance to drop the gun didn't I?" I asked him feeling this would be pure hell to work with him and I haven't been wrong yet.  Austin's resentment towards me didn't get any better when the other officers were congratulating me on a job well done. For the first time in my twenty years as a law enforcement officer I was actually ashamed of my ability as a woman to be able to protect my partner and wondered if he would protect me as well. I didn't want to cause a ruckus by asking to be replaced with another partner, I was a woman and I would have to prove myself.  Austin had me to do the great part of our job completing the paper work. At least I found something that he was grateful for me being his partner.... I did all the paper work, filing, and listening to his constant complaining.  I had not one bit of desire to ever marry thanks to Austin. Come to think of it I didn't even date after I began working with him.  A week later we were setting up a sting in down town Ft. Lauderdale area off of Broward Boulevard and around Sistrunk. There were five other officers with us, Austin and his fishing buddy Stan drove the truck which was air conditioned while myself, Ariana, her partner Troy, Brad and his partner Dan in the back of the rented U - Haul truck that was not air conditioned and the back door had been left unlocked so that when we heard them saying It's been a pleasure shopping with you, we would jump out of the back of the truck and make our arrest. So we were off all dressed in our black outfits, raiders in white letters across the front of our shirts. I am always nervous just before the first raid after that I am on a pure rush of adrenalin. They made the sell and we flew out of the back of the truck, two black males start running and we're in hot pursuit, we are taking hedges like hurdles in the Olympics. I past Ariana who had one guy down on the ground handcuffing him with Troy. I saw the truck coming around the bend trying to trap the other guy; I was a few feet away from him and dove through the air tackling him to the ground. He was a young kid and was putting up quite a bit of a struggle, Austin flew out of the truck along with Stan and they were able to subdue him and get the handcuffs on him. Stan helped me up off the ground.  "You got a nasty cut on your elbow; you better go have it taken care of." Stan told me looking at my arm as he held it seeing how deep it was.  Austin laughed "ah did wonder woman get a nasty boo boo?" he asked laughing putting the guy in the other squad car that was waiting.  I pulled my arm away." I am fine." I told him and went to the first aid kit I carry with me, I cleansed my arm and then wrapped it up. God it hurt so bad I wanted to cry, but I refused to let Austin see me weak.  The rest of the day my arm was throbbing, the sweat didn't help any either. I had to chase one female who decided to use my wound against me and grabbed my arm and twisted it, I saw Austin stop and watch her attacking my arm and this infuriated me that I went into my martial arts and was able to handcuff the female assailant.  Austin then approached me and the female.  "Need help wonder woman?" he asked me smugly knowing I had seen him just standing there.  "Not at all Batman." I told him smiling walking past him with the female to the van that was waiting with six other people they were able to take down in this bust.  I sat in the back of the truck and I wanted to cry, no matter what I did he would not give me a chance. Troy looked at me and patted my shoulder.  "You going to be alright?" he asked me.  Why did he have to say those words to me? Why couldn't he just be mean to me like Austin? Tears burnt my eyes and I had to look away from him. "I am just tired." I told him wiping the tears away and knowing he knew I was crying because of Austin. Damn you Austin Tyler! I thought to myself.  I kept up with them and at the end of the day when we were back in the office Troy insisted on checking my arm.  Austin looked at me disgustedly. "Women always have men waiting on them!" he said to Troy.  Troy a very good looking man age forty eight, with crystal blue eyes, he wore his brown hair in the service style cut. He was six feet and weighed one hundred ninety pounds, divorced and did not ever date unless one of the guys fixed him up.  "Lay off of her Austin." He told him looking at him very seriously.  "Sorry if you're sucking up to her to get a piece of that ass." Austin told him.  Troy walked inches from him." shut the fuck up Austin!" he told him through gritted teeth.  I couldn't just stand there, so I turned and left the office walking hurriedly out of the station and running to my car where my room mate was waiting for me.  "I thought you might need a friend." She said holding her arms out to me. I fell into her arms and cried so hard. Not only was my feelings wounded, but my arm hurt so fucking bad!  "Why does he hate me so much?" I cried when I realized Stan was watching what was happening. "Great he'll report back to him that wonder woman cracked!" I cried even harder getting into the car. I'll meet you at the house." I told her and pulled away driving to the emergency room to have my arm bandaged.  I received five stitches to my elbow, but the doctor couldn't stitch up my hurt feelings. I cried on the way home and was shocked to see Troy waiting outside of the house. He was talking with Ariana and her boyfriend Steve.  He opened my car door so I could get out.  "How many?" he asked me.  "Five." I replied knowing what he meant.  "Go out with me tonight?" he asked with a little boys grin.  "I guess it would be okay." I told him getting butterflies in my stomach.  Ariana helped me to dress for my date, she had me wear a pair of white low cut slacks, a pink tank top that showed just a small part of my stomach. I wore my hair up on my head in a tight pony tail with a pink hair scrunchie, a pair of white pearl tear drop earrings, very little make - up with my lips out lined in a dark pink with light pink lip stick. I started laughing as I looked in the mirror.  "Hell I would date me I look so good." I said checking me out in the mirror.  "You crazy bitch your date is waiting." She told me.  We entered the room where the two men were drinking a glass of ice tea. Troy did a double take when he saw me. I felt very sexy and good about myself tonight, not even Austin could change my mood. We went to a cozy little restaurant and we shared a pizza with a beer. We walked down two doors and played a game of pool. He killed me on the first game, it was the second game that counted and I won. He had to wash my car for a month. Troy drove me home and our good night kiss ended us in the bedroom with our tongues exploring each others mouths and he slipped my shirt off of me caressing my breast and sucking the erect nipples. He helped me out of my slacks and white thongs, and I unzipped his pants on my knees with my mouth. I helped him to step out of his pants as he pulled off his shirt and I began to massage his balls and licking his hard erection with my tongue in a slow circular motion around the head and down the shaft. He laid back on my bed and I slowly climbed up his body licking every inch of him going up, I straddled him feeling his erection entering my hot wet juices that were flowing over his erection, I massaged my breast as his hands guided my hips in a slow circular motion, the passion was growing hot with in us both, I grabbed the back of my head board with both hands as our bodies were grinding into each other harder and faster until I screamed out from the orgasm that rocked my world under every inch of me. I fell on top of him laughing and he rolled me over on my back.  "What is so funny?" he asked smiling down at me.  "You made the earth tremble." I told him kissing his mouth softly.  We made love again for hours and fell to sleep in each others arms. It felt good to wake up and fix breakfast for someone besides myself, Ariana and Steve. We sat there eating eggs and waffles laughing over silly stuff our other room mate Sara Jordan came in, she worked the night shift so we hardly saw her unless it was on one of our days off. Sara was a tall red head with green eyes, none of us were petit little creatures, but very much toned and in shape.  She got a huge smile when she saw Troy and I together.  "Damn it I missed the house shaking last night." She said laughing fixing her a plate to eat before going to bed.  "Well I got to go." I said laughing at her. "Another day of doing another sweep this one is in Pompano Beach off Martin Luther King. Again it was the same as yesterday Austin and Stan rode up front, Troy and I kept making eye contact and smiling. The first one was really strange. We went down sixteenth and men were coming up to the truck and in just a few seconds we were chasing down what seemed like the whole street. I was in pursuit of a young black male who was dressed in all black he ran behind a run down motel and as I turned the corner I came to a screeching halt, the young black male wasn't anywhere in sight, standing there waiting was a large black male with gold swirls all over his skin, he was without clothes and blew a huge flame of fire at me. I went from running forward to backwards in one instant flat.  "Woe shit! "Was all I heard myself saying when I ran right smack into Austin almost knocking him down.  "What the fuck!" he yelled looking at this fire breathing thing coming at us. He grabbed his gun; I had mine in my hand. "Halt or we will shoot." He told the thing coming at us.  The thing laughed in a sound that only demons make in a scary movie, but we weren't in a movie we were in reality. It kept coming at us and we kept backing up firing, the others heard our gun shots and came to investigate, people were praying and screaming running away from this demonic monster. We were firing at it, but it kept walking towards us breathing huge flames at us and then just disappeared.  We stood there looking around, our hearts pounding so hard in our chest.  I looked around and the people were still running when the young black male came out from behind the motel all bloodied and burnt, he had fear all over his face crying for his mama. Whatever we stumbled on today was defiantly not from our world. More police units came to the scene; the Governor was flown in and kept in open line to the white house. Today our world as we once knew it was forever gone.  That night Troy and I lay in each others arms after hours of love making, our bodies wanted the other one, his kisses were hot and inviting. As soon as he placed his hand between my thighs he could feel my thick rich juices flowing, his mouth hungrily found my swollen nipples. Oh how he made the earth tremble and my body wanted more of him and I began grinding so hard on his large cock that I felt as if I would suck his entire body into me. He pinned my arms back over my head and began ramming his cock deeper into my soaked pussy that we both exploded into a orgasm that felt like it rocked the entire house.  He kissed me good night and held on to me tightly as we slept through the night. We both were scared for the first time in all of our police work we had faced something that we hadn't a clue how to fight.  Troy woke up very aroused and we made love before getting out of bed, as his body made love to mine he looked deep into my eyes.  "Will you marry me?" he asked me as his body never missed a beat in his love making.  All I could do was smile as tears were burning my eyes.  CHAPTER 2  Austin and I were at a stake out off Marina drive in Light House Point, we were watching a house for two months when tonight we got the break we had been waiting for and made a drug bust of one hundred thousand dollars in the club drug ecstasy that had been killing teenagers, we also netted a street value of ten thousand dollars in marijuana. We were on our way back in when we heard officer down come over the radio, without a word Austin and I were on our way to the scene. I knew when I saw Ariana it was Troy. I ran to where he lay struggling for air as the oxygen wasn't helping. I held him in my arms and he struggled to get something out of his pocket. It was a diamond engagement ring; he placed it on my finger before he took his last breath.  I cried out in pain. "Troy please don't go! Please stay, don't go! I love you.... Don't go." I cried rocking back and forth with him.  I heard Ariana telling Austin that thing attacked them; he never had a chance it was on him before he could pull his gun. The monster had struck again two streets from the first time it appeared.  Austin helped me up and held me in his arms for the first time he showed a tender side about him. Austin took me and Ariana home, Sara was waiting for us when we arrived. I looked at Austin as my eyes filled like a lake with tears.  "Austin I never got to tell him I am pregnant. He doesn't know we were going to have a child." I cried into his arms.  "We'll work through this, I promise Montana." He told me holding me close.  For the first time in our relationship he treated me as a human being and he showed me he does have feelings and he can care. I would continue working as long as I was not showing and then Austin would have me at the desk so the child would not be harmed. I actually think he was excited about the birth. One day when I was home turning the den into a nursery he brought over footballs, base ball bats, airplanes he hung from the ceiling and the cutest Miami dolphins warm up suit for the baby he named Ricky to wear home in.  It was nice having a man around during my pregnancy. When I was six months pregnant I was working in the office doing all the paper work when I heard a loud commotion in the hall way. I stuck my head out the door and there was the monster thing that killed Troy. He saw me and kept throwing people all over making his way towards me. I quickly slammed the door, my heart was beating hard, and all I could think about was protecting my child. I was crying trying to open the window so I could escape, but it was stuck and wouldn't open. I heard the office door being smashed behind me, I heard gun fire and I prayed to God for help. He was in the office with me, I turned and saw him charging at me and then a sparkling mist appeared in front of me and it was Troy, the two battled until Troy hit him with a lightening bolt blowing him up.  "Troy....How are you here?" I asked him crying and touching his face.  "I took a better job lets say." He told me kissing my forehead. "You and I will be together one day, just now is not our time. Take care of our child, baby I will always be near when you need me." He told me and vanished into the white sparking mist.  You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings © Austin could not believe what he had just witnessed. He hung his head down as tears ran down his face. "Montana I am sorry for how I treated you before." He told me.  "I never took you seriously Austin so don't worry about it." I told him feeling very sad for him.  He was looking down at the ground. "I am sorry I made you cry the day you cut your arm." He told me walking to me and taking me in his arms holding me.  Stan did tell him and he kept it to him self. What happened the day I lost Troy between Austin and I kept growing deeper.  At nine months I was so huge, and Austin didn't help any with the ice cream and pickles he kept stuffing me with. As I walked he would sing wibbles wobbles but they don't fall down. It was a great day to go into labor; I was at the filing cabinet when suddenly my water broke.  "Austin, it's time." I said holding my stomach.  "Oh no you peed your pants!" he said with a strange look on his face.  I couldn't help but to laugh." No my water broke silly and the baby is starting to push his way out." I told him holding my stomach bent over.  "Oh shit, what do I do?" he asked running over to me.  "We need to lay me down he's coming out." I told him feeling the contractions coming one after the other.  "Squeeze your legs together you have to get to the hospital." He told me trying to get me to walk out of the office.  "No I can't." I told him going down to the ground.  Austin began calling for help and the chief, Ariana and Hannah came running into the office.  "Oh, oh we have a baby coming out!" she said pulling my pants off.  Ariana and Hannah delivered my little boy Ricky. He weighed ten pounds six ounces and had black hair. I kept him in my hospital room with me when I saw the sparkling mist appear by his bed. Troy picked our son up in his arms smiling down at him.  "You must protect him for great things are coming his way." He told me holding our son. He laid him in his bed and vanished.  "Troy......."I said softly sitting in my hospital bed.  I couldn't sleep that night so I decided to take a walk to look at the other babies and I found Austin at my door a sleep in a chair on the other side of the door.  "Austin come in here." I told him. "What are you doing here?" I asked him.  "I wanted to be near the baby and ....You." he told me looking down at the floor.  He took my hand in his hand and kissed me softly on my lips. "I want us to be a family." He said holding me in his arms. "Marry me." He told me.  I was totally shocked and I saw Troy standing behind him smiling and nodding for me to say yes. "Yes Austin I will marry you." I told him and he held me tightly.  Austin put him self on the birth certificate as the father. We were married eight weeks later. Ariana and Sara watched the baby while we were on our honeymoon in Disney world.  Life was different being married to Austin he moved us into his house in Davie, Florida. I was not happy knowing that when I went back to work I had been moved to a different unit and a new partner. I had become accustom to Austin's moodiness which is good because it will help in our marriage.  I had come home early one day from work, it was Austin's birthday and I had invited our friends from work. I ordered a female stripper who weighed close to three hundred and fifty pounds; she was blond and wore more make up than Tammy Faye Baker. I slipped into a white halter dress with the back cut just above my buttocks making my white lacy thong seen just above the dress over my hips. The front had a diamond shape hole cut from in between my breast to just below my navel. I wore my hair up on my head with white dangling earrings, and a pair of white sandals.  I had catered in a smoked turkey meal and the birthday cake held his stripper. We sat out by the pool as everyone mingled around eating and drinking. I hired a local band to play old time rock for the party and hired an Elvis Impersonator for the final finale. Everyone was singing and dancing, thank God everyone had a designated driver for those who were drinking. Austin slow danced with me holding me tightly to his body, I felt attracted to him tonight, I mean sexually attracted to him to him. He kissed me softly on my neck, running his hands up and down my back. I found myself becoming moist and my nipples were hard and erect. Austin danced me to behind some bushes away from the party and began to kiss me passionately as I returned just as hot and passionate kisses to him.  He ran his hands over my breast and sat down on the air conditioning unit that was hid inside of the bushes. He released his erection from with in his pants and raised my dress up removing my thongs. I straddled him taking him deep with in my hot juices and moving our bodies in a slow grind as he held my thongs to his face taking in the sweet smell of me into his nostrils, we both came in a hot and passionate orgasm that made me weak in my knees. We pulled ourselves together and joined the party as if we had never just made love only two feet from where everyone was having a good time. Austin was sat in the middle of the room for his cake and presents, he was amazed at the size of the cake thinking the guys did it with some sexy babe in the cake. He tried to run away when the stripper came out of the cake, two of his co workers held him so he could not escape the very large stripper that had trapped him putting red lips all over his face.  After the party was over we sat out by the pool, I stood up letting my dress fall to the ground followed by my thong and stepped into the pool, he followed me into the water nude, I wrapped my arms and legs around him licking his lips softly with my tongue, I began licking his chest and then under the water licking his hard erection and caressing his balls. I would come up for air ever so often causing him to grab me and kissing me passionately running his hands all over my body, he could no longer stand the desire to release his fluids deep inside of my own hot juices, he grabbed me and entered me from behind, caressing my breast and massaging my clit as he grounded his hips harder making his erection to go deeper with in my hot wet juices as my arms were wrapped behind his neck as he ravished my body and massaging my swollen clit as my body began to tremble from the orgasm that racked mine and his body.  That night we came to the realization that we had fallen in love with each other and I slept in his arms feeling so safe and secure. It's not everyday you find true love, but I had been graced with two true loves.  I had been transferred to the plain clothes division, I finally got issued a new car too, a gold Ford Taurus, no not my little red car I had been hoping for. We were going to go investigate a shooting at a neighborhood store off Dixie Highway in Ft. Lauderdale. A man was shot to death in his car by a rival gang for being at the right place at the wrong time. He was caught up by stray bullets being fired at the other passing car when a deadly bullet hit him in the temple killing him instantly.  My partner Rachel Smyth and I were questioning witnesses just as one of the suspect's car drove by and was spotted by one of our witnesses. Rachel a young woman age twenty - six, with light brown long hair, brown eyes, tall and toned we proceeded to give chase while we left the other squad car behind to secure any evidence that might be found by the crime scene unit.  The light blue Toyota spotted us and began speeding down the road and through red lights, Rachel radioed for help in securing the speeding car. We followed the car into a near by alley when the suspects car came to a sudden stop. We looked at each other wondering why they had stopped; Rachel kept in radio contact with the dispatcher Misty. We noticed a blue light glowing inside the car and both men vanished and my heart skipped a beat, we looked around to see if we could see them when both men appeared on each side of the car beating on the window, without hesitation I threw the car in reverse while we both screamed at the top of our lungs. Both men looked like demons; they were red with horns and fangs. I did not stop until I hit the pavement of the road leading to the alley and turned my car and we headed out of there when we heard pounding on the top of the car and the roof began to cave in.  "Oh shit their on the fucking car!" I yelled slamming on the brakes and watched the two creatures go flying in the air, but they never hit the ground they just vanished.  "Where are they?" Rachel asked looking around not realizing the radio had been static and just now we had a clear reception. We heard the dispatcher Misty trying to get us to respond.  Finally we saw the other police cars coming and I was relieved. I opened my car door slowly making sure it was the police and then stepped out when I felt a searing burning sensation in my neck. I watched my head leave my body as the creatures had decapitated me. I saw my body hit the ground but I was standing beside the car still when I turned and blew the creatures into oblivion with one swipe of my hands. Rachel was screaming seeing the attack on my body. I entered into a new form of life and then I saw Troy. We were dead, together now just dead though.  "What happen?" I asked him as he walked to me.  "We are Guardian police now." He told me." Come on I will explain it all to you." He told me taking my hand and we left in the white sparkling mist.  We went to a beautiful place that had colorful butterflies floating around, a beautiful water fall and fairy's floating around sprinkling gold dust around.  "We both were killed by demonic creatures of the dark side also known as evil, hell and so forth. Since we fought against evil in our life we were chosen to be special kind of police here. There are a lot of us here." He said holding my hand.  "What about Ricky?" I asked feeling sad having to leave him.  "Austin will be there for him." He told me gently.  "Austin..." I whispered his name thinking how this would effect him, we had just found our love and now we have to let go. "It's not fair." I said feeling remorse for my heart ached for Austin.  Austin sat in our living room as Ariana and Rachel broke the news to him about my death. He sat quietly, not making a sound and then looked at our picture of our wedding day. "Well I have to go to work. "He told them handing Ariana Ricky.  He walked out of the house and then dropped to his knees crying, the women stood in the door watching him and feeling helpless to help in his time of sorrow. I knelt before him wiping away his tears.  "Don't mourn me Austin; we will meet again one day." I told him kissing him softly on his lips and vanishing.  Austin looked up at the sky crying. "No! Not Montana!" he cried out in pain.  My sister's Natasha and Jessica came to stay with Austin to help him to get through the funeral.  I was given a new assignment to go back to the force only as someone else since I was decapitated I couldn't very well go back as myself. I returned as Koko Bear full blooded Native American and my police dog which happened to be Troy my faithful wolf Anoki. Anoki was a white wolf with blue eyes and I was a twenty six year old single female fresh out of the academy and off the reservation and Austin who was bitterer then before was assigned to me. My luck right? The first day with Austin was just horrible he yelled at me and Anoki who would cover his eyes in the back seat with his paws as Austin ranted and raved.  "I must have baby sitter wrote all over me for me to get stuck with all the partners fresh out of diapers!" he yelled at me.  I had enough of his big mouth. "First of all gramps, I am not happy being stuck with the geriatrics ward! I am quite capable of protecting myself and your tired white ass, as far as Anoki who is my real partner he is not a mutt, but a wolf so learn the difference!" I yelled at him.  "You fucking spoiled little brat do not speak to me in that manner!" he yelled turning all red in his face with his eyes bulging as well as his veins.  I could not resist I stuck my thumbs in my ears waving my fingers at him and stuck out my tongue.  He looked at me so seriously after coming to a complete stop at a red light. "Just go the rest of the day without so much a word to me Detective Bear." He told me angrily for he didn't want to show he had feelings too.  "Fine Detective grumpy." I said smiling.  "Neener, neener." He said sticking his fingers in his ears and his tongue out at me.  Anoki had his paws over his eyes as if he was embarrassed to be seen with them.  CHAPTER THREE  There were a couple of demons who had come into the police force and they were keeping their drug rings from being busted along with their houses of prostitution. It did not just end with the police; Judges as well as Senators had been invaded with the Dark side's army. As I was going into the gym to work out with Anoki by my side I over heard an argument between a male uniform police officer and a female detective.  "Look Roy we had a deal, unless you want that pretty little seventeen year old hottie working in the house you will stick to our bargain." She told him smugly.  "Why don't you tell us about the deal Roy?" I asked stepping out of the darkness so they could see me.  "You just made a mistake Koko." She told me.  "No Detective Satinni you did." I told her blowing her up with one swipe of my hand when her eyes glowed red.  "Jesus Christ what are you?" he asked petrified of us.  "No not Jesus Christ, but we're on the same side as he is though." I told him smiling.  I took him back to my office while Austin was talking to the new female dispatcher and I felt a pang of jealousy that he was taking her out tonight. Who is watching Ricky? I thought to myself. I tried to push my feelings to the side, but Troy even picked up on them sitting his paw on my knee whimpering as if to comfort me. Roy told me everything he knew, he gave me names of the ones who were in charge and the names of the ones who were being forced to participate in the illegal activities. Anoki and I left without a word to Austin and we went to Sergeant Briggs house. He opened the door with a surprise look on his face.  "Koko what do I owe the pleasure of your visit? He asked me.  "Oh lets just say I know what you are." I told him with a smirk on my face.  Anoki had turned into Troy when we walked into the house and Sergeant Briggs turned into a demon with hoofs for feet, horns and a face like a Billy goat. We were able to destroy him by hitting him with double electrical balls causing him to explode. When we left the house heading to the next home of our Chief. He opened the door expecting us as well were the other demons waiting with him.  "Didn't you two learn the first time?" he asked throwing daggers at us. Anoki had turned into Troy and I caught the dagger with my hand.  "Didn't you learn how to throw in demon school Chief?" I asked him sending a huge fire ball at his aid Samantha and blowing her up.  "Impressive for a beginner." He said throwing a lightening bolt at me when I heard Austin yelling and Ricky crying.  "You hurt either one of them and I will do worse then send you back to hell!" I told him searching the house with my eyes, listening closely to try to pin point exactly where they were in the house when I found them in an upstairs room I vanished leaving everyone down stairs to save my family. Austin's eyes grew wide when appeared out of the white sparkling mist blowing up the demon bitch he had made a date with. She used their date to lure him and Ricky here. I turned when I felt a burning sensation in my arm; I had been hit with an electrical ball by a demon on the other side of the room.  "Shit I just bought this shirt asshole!" I told the short fat repugnant man and blew him up. "Take my hand." I told him grabbing Ricky and taking them to safety out side of the house and then I went back to help Troy to get rid of the rest of the house full of demons. When we emerged out of the house and Austin and Ricky were waiting for us.  "Troy, how?" he asked him looking at me.  "Austin we were sent back to fight evil here." He told him.  Austin turned to me,"Thank you for saving us." He told me not realizing who I was.  "Austin, its Montana." Troy told him.  Austin looked at me with tears forming in his eyes." God, I miss you baby." He said crying biting his bottom lip as it quivered.  I had tears fill my eyes." My sweet, sweet love I have missed you and Ricky." I told him wrapping my arms around him. Troy held his son while I comforted Austin.  Austin pulled him self together and Troy changed back to Anoki and we rode back to the house.  I walked around straightening it up and he begged us to stay at the house while we were here. We agreed and during the time Troy would be him self unless we had visitors and then he would turn back into Anoki. The three of us slept in our king size bed. Troy excused himself on the second night leaving Austin and I alone in the bed.  "Montana can you look like you use to look?" he asked me running his fingers along my face so softly.  I turned back into Montana and his eyes swelled up with tears as he cried taking me into his arms, he cried so hard with every fiber in his body, his lips searched for mine, his hands roamed my body as they had so many time before, he touched between my thighs finding the wet hot juices welcoming his fingers to explore even more deeper, he raised his body on top of mine kissing my breast and sucking my hardened erect nipples, our moans mingled together, he grinded deeper and harder inside of me until we exploded into an explosive orgasm. I lay in his arms giggling.  "What are you laughing about?" he asked me.  "You are so good in bed that you made a dead girl come in a heat of passion." I said laughing.  "I better stay out of the grave yards then." He said teasingly. "I don't want you to leave me again Montana." He said holding me tightly.  "I wish I didn't have to go, but one day they will call me home." I told him.  The next couple of weeks were really great being with Austin and Ricky. Troy had so much fun with our son. It was touching watching them play together.  We were investigating a rash of murders that involved oriental females of all ages. The victims were raped, burnt with cigarettes all over their bodies; they were then decapitated holding their heads in between their legs to give the effect of giving them self's oral sex. I hated this case and the way the perpetrator humiliated the victims in such a degrading manner. As Austin, Anoki and I walked through the crime scene of the third victim an eighty year old grandmother, had been brutally raped, and savagely tortured before he killed her.  "I want this sick son of a bitch!" I told Austin with tears forming in my eyes.  "I think we all are in agreement we have to catch this asshole." Austin said as the crime scene was gathering the evidence.  Anoki began growling, his hair stood up on his back and he walked slowly towards the closet door. I felt as if I had stopped breathing as I walked to the closet and slowly opened the door to find a twenty year old oriental woman crouched down crying. I was shocked to see her in there especially alive. I took her hand in mine and that was when I saw a vision of the demon that was killing these women. He was standing behind me collecting evidence, Austin was asking me what I saw when he looked up from the victim with red glowing eyes and I instinctively hit him with a flaming ball of fire that missed him. Anoki was gliding through the air landing on top of him as Troy. They battled each other rolling around the floor when the demon known as Detective Miller pulled out a large dagger to sever Troy's throat when I hit his hand with a lightening bolt causing the dagger to go flying across the room. With one swipe of my hand I hit him with a huge lightening ball in his face causing half of his face to burn. He fell off of Troy holding his burning face when I severed his head with one swipe of my hand. I looked at Austin as he and the other officers watched me not saying a word as if they were afraid of upsetting me even more.  You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings © "Sorry decapitation is a sensitive issue with me. Any memory of what was witnessed will be wiped away from their memories as soon as we leave." I told Austin calming down a little.  We would sit under the tree at the house that was near the man made pond watching the sun set it was so peaceful. Anoki sat by Ricky in his infant swing cooing and laughing at Anoki as if he knew it was really his father. We looked like the perfect happy family sitting together and laughing. Anoki would even get Austin to play Frisbee with him. It was not quite the same as when Troy and Austin played on the beach two years ago trying to impress all the younger women. I watched them playing and the sound of Ricky cooing at the two playing warmed my heart.  The next few weeks were actually calm; I kept dreading that they were going to be calling us home any time because of it being so peaceful.  I should have known it would not have been quiet for long, we were sent to Tallahassee our Governor it seems made a pack with the devil to be elected president for the next eight years and the Dark side could have his soul willingly. We walked through the halls of the Governors home it was immaculate and huge; everything was white right down to the leather furniture and the white marble floor. Well Gov. Brown you have done quite well stealing the tax payer's money. I whispered to myself. The governor was in his bedroom on the bed with the young Spanish maid dressed in the black and white maid's uniform.  "Now that is what I call really serving our Governor." I said loudly startling the two lovers.  The Governor lost his interest in his bed partner and became interested in his uninvited guest.  "Who are you?" he asked raising off the bed putting him self back in his pants.  "Where is Mrs. Gov.?" I asked being a smart ass.  He rang for security on his burglar button, but I had disabled it before barging into the room.  "They won't be coming to save you because I killed the security system, but it will start working as soon as I am done with your miserable ass." I told him walking up to him and pushing him on the bed.  "You're going to regret this attack on me because I have very powerful associates that will protect me." He yelled as Anoki growled at him.  "I know and you tell Michael that my boss canceled your contract for President and Michael still gets your soul." I told him when his eyes began to glow red.  His body began to change into a hideous beast." You will die!" he yelled in a demonic voice.  I smiled at him and began singing the theme song to Cops blowing him up with my powers. Bad boy whatcha gonna do?" I said with a smile and I looked at the frighten maid.  "Go do your work and pray for your sin of adultery." I told her.  Anoki and I vanished into a white sparkling mist and back in the office with Austin who was putting together a two story log cabin with tooth picks when we appeared scaring him and causing him to knock half of his cabin down.  "Oops sorry Austin." I said trying not to smile.  "I wish you could knock before appearing it would help to reduce the risk of a heart attack taking place." He said holding his heart.  I tried to remain composed, but I really wanted to burst out laughing. "I am so sorry Austin." I told him as I walked over to him kissing him on his forehead not realizing that Ariana was watching us.  "Gee Austin, Montana hasn't been dead that long and you're already getting a new girlfriend to replace her." Ariana told him as tears filled her eyes.  "Ariana wait, you and I were best friends." I told her without thinking.  "You're crazy, I was his wife's best friend I hardly know you." She told me looking at me as if I were the plague.  I had already opened the can of beans so I might as well finish the meal." I am Montana." I told her turning into myself when I made sure no one else saw me.  She stood still with tears flowing over the brim of her eyes." Montana." She whispered and fell into my arms.  Anoki became Troy and the three of us stood there hugging. "Oh how I have missed you two." she told us. "How did you come back? That was a stupid question, the good guys sent you back." She said smiling through her tears.  "I have missed you so much Ariana! Come for dinner tonight." I told her as we both were now crying.  We ate dinner that night talking and laughing, even Troy had joined us at the table. Ariana ended up spending the night in the spare room and her and Troy sat up most of the night going down memory lane of all the cases they did together. The next morning we cooked our regular breakfast of waffles and eggs making Sara come by for breakfast. She took the news like Ariana, but it felt so right that the old room mates were back together again.  Tommy was sitting at the desk when he over heard two detectives from vice discussing who was going to pick up their Thursday pay from the strip joint on Martin Luther King Boulevard. He came to Austin and myself telling us what he had over heard. We decided to go check it out. I changed into a ravishing red head with green cat eyes, the body that everyman wanted his wife to have a tight body with a flat belly and great boobs. Austin looked at me smiling; I slapped him on his chest with the back of my hand.  "Forget those thoughts if you want to keep body parts attached to your body." I told him then pinched his cheek lightly.  "Its not really like being with another woman Montana it would still be you, like its you when your Koko." He told me when he saw he was not making a sale on this subject. "I guess it's not a good idea." He said watching my ass as I began to get out of the van to go across the street. "I will be here thinking of you." He said imagining me on top of him seducing him.  I was hired and would start that night, it was explained about the champagne room, and that if I was caught having sex with a customer it would lead to my being dismissed. I realized why I was not shown the room when two dancers came out with a large bald man high on cocaine. One of the girls handed the large fat man with blond greasy hair, blue jeans and a white shirt that I was talking to five hundred dollars.  "Good job girls." He told the naked women walking pass him with their very satisfied customer who was looking me over in my black low cut wide legged pants, with a hot pink half shirt that exposed my pink lacy bra with matching thongs that could be seen just at the top of the slacks and a pair of pink opened toe six inch spiked heels. I smiled at him and purposely showed the tip of my tongue very slowly wetting my bottom lip. That night I wore white low cut slacks just above my pelvic, a white sheer shirt with a white lacy bra and matching thong with white sandals. I walked into the place seeing the large man sitting there watching the door, his eyes lit up when he saw me and came up to me without waiting.  "I want a private dance with you in the room." He said undressing me with his eyes.  "Ok hon. I will be right with you." I told him going into the dressing room changing into a short red leather skirt just below my ass, a red leather bra and matching thongs, a red half top and I walked out to him in my six inch spiked heels. He followed me to the room, he sat at the chair at the round table built around the table where I began to bump and grind my ass, tits and pussy inches from his face. I saw his hand rubbing his erection and I removed my top slowly teasing him with my provocative movements rubbing my hands over my body slowly, removing my bra and tossing it behind me. He was rubbing his erection even harder, I turned my back to him and began removing my shirt and moving my hips in a circular motion, I bent over and looking at him between my legs while running my hand slowly over my crotch, I then stood up removing my thong and throwing them at him that he caught smiling up at me, I slowly brought myself down on the stage massaging my breast and let my hand go down my stomach slowly until I was at the tip of my pelvic and turned my body so my crotch inches from him and I began to masturbate as he masturbated, my fingers slowly and sensually massaged my clit that was becoming swollen and wet, my fingers were gliding smoother from the hot juices that were seeping from me, my hips were moving in slow circular grinding motions and before I realized it I was caught up in the dark seduction taking place and felt the man orally pleasuring me, my hips began to arch up towards his face, my hands caressed my hardened nipples, I bit my bottom lip from the pleasure he was giving my body with his tongue slowly licking my sticky sweet hot juices. I felt him entering my body, I wanted him, I could not understand what was happening to me it was if this man was consuming me entirely. I was moaning from deep with in me and I came in such a hot passionate orgasm. He exploded his juices deep with in me and I heard him laughing in my ear and then I saw his glowing eyes and knew I had been seduced by a demon with out realizing it. He was still in me and began kissing me, I returned his kisses hungrily as his hand were caressing my breast; he began to move his hips causing himself to become erect again. He rolled me on top of him and I moved slowly in a circular motion gradually moving slowly then working my hips faster and faster until we were like animals mating and he turned into his demonic self ravishing me until he heard my cries from the orgasm racking my body over and over. I couldn't resist him and it was as if he were draining my very life from me and he was gaining strength from me.  "Not much longer my good little warrior and I will have all of your powers as well as your life. Turn over so I can feed my appetite with you." He ordered me.  I obeyed and propped myself up so he could enter me doggy style. He was so huge and because he was becoming more evil each time we had sex his penis was actually so cold it burnt me, but I wanted more, and as he dug his fingers into my hips thrashing me with his hard erection harder and harder his breath was so hot it actually felt cold blowing down on my bare ass. I began to massage my clit and moaned from the pleasure he was giving me when I collapsed from the last orgasm. When I had awakened I was in the van with Troy leaning over me.  "Where is my Master Thomas?" I asked as my eyes were almost coal black and I longed for his touch.  "Montana he is gone, I destroyed him to save your life." He told me holding a wet cloth on my forehead.  I became crazed in the van throwing Troy to the front of the van with Austin who looked so confused. I was screaming like a crazed person and what was worse I felt my soul burning. Troy looked at me and then pounced on top of me and we vanished in a white sparkling mist.  Chapter 4  I was strapped down to a silver table that was cold to my bare flesh, there were bright lights over me and people in long white robes with long white beards looked down on me chanting the same words over and over and moving their hands over my body in the same way and motion. Suddenly I became violently ill throwing up purple green slime that bubbled onto the ground and then I became suddenly cold and blacked out again. When I awakened I was in a pure white room with a white gown and covers on me, there was a white sparkling fog that floated around the room when a man in a long white robe and long white hair and beard took my hand.  "Welcome back Montana." He said holding my hand.  "Welcome back....... I have been somewhere?" I asked feeling slightly disorientated.  "Yes you were trapped with in the dark side for a short time." He told me smiling so kindly I did not want to leave for I felt so safe and at peace.  "I love it here it is so peaceful." I told him.  "Well your well now and its time to return to your family." He told me and the next thing I knew I was standing in my bathroom getting out of the shower when Austin came walking in.  "Almost ready to go baby?" he asked me kissing me.  "yes." I said looking at myself as Koko in the mirror.  I dressed while Anoki and Ariana were in the kitchen waiting for us to leave. Seven detectives tied to the club and being paid money to protect them against being busted plus a percentage on the prostitution.  Austin kept me in the car with him while Ariana was the one under cover this time. We raided the place after three months of gathering strong evidence against all seven detectives, the club owners as well were looking at some long prison sentences for conspiracy of prostitution and drugs with the intent to purchase and sell.  Troy and Ariana were spending a lot of time together, laughing and talking until in the early morning hours, I looked at Ariana smiling.  "So is there a romance blooming between my two favorite people?" I asked sipping on my morning coffee.  "Would you be bothered by it?" she asked me.  "No Ariana I am married to Austin even if I am dead I will always be his wife. I love Troy he is Ricky's father and my best friend, but my heart is branded deeply by Austin." I told her sipping my coffee.  "Good because I find him so damned hot now, I can't stop thinking about him. Last night he kissed me and I swear I saw stars when he kissed me." She said her smile was so bright.  Well I guess I will go get Austin up so we are not late." I told her.  "Koko do you get hungry or thirsty?" she asked me looking curiously at me.  "No we don't, we just go through the motions so that no one feels strange sitting with dead people." I told her smiling.  I went to our bedroom and sat beside Austin watching him sleep when he opened one eye. He smiled taking my hand under the covers placing it in his pajama bottoms on his erection.  "I need to be fed and he wants you for breakfast." He said pulling me under the covers.  We were laughing and making love to each other before he had to get up. He loves to make love in the mornings when he first wakes up. I love feeling him searching my body with his hands, feeling his lips on my neck and sucking on my hardened erect nipples until I cry out from the orgasms he gives my body.  Anoki and I were materialized in Washington D.C. unfortunately their landing was off and they sat us in the president's rest room being used by the President, yes the President of the USA. He did not find it amusing since he was in his birthday suit, he would never have won Presidency if the American people saw that body! He screamed, we screamed and a hundred and twenty pound Shepard is not a great screamer either, Anoki sounded like a poodle. The reason why we were there we soon found out was that the vice president had been replaced by a demon and he was going to kill the president this morning while he bathed so he could take over the government.  We now have surprised the vice president who had a hypodermic filled with a liquid pain killer that the president is very much allergic too and would be dead in ten minutes after the injection. The vice President was caught by us and destroyed before he could carry his plan out, the vice president has not been found or heard from and he is still listed as MIA. Anoki and I walked into a park in Washington I petted his head.  "We need to talk Troy." I told him sitting on the park bench.  Anoki jumped up on the bench next to me turning into Troy. "What is wrong?" He asked me looking so sweet.  "I know about you and Ariana and I am cool with it." I told him taking his hand.  "That's really sweet of you to be ok with it." He said he was very agitated with me at the moment.  "I thought that when you died you would be back in my arms, but no good old Austin has you and I personally am not cool with that." He told me looking so angry.  "He's my husband! I love him and I will not apologize to you or anyone else for giving him my heart." I told him with tears stinging my eyes.  Troy looked at me. "I remember a time I was supposed to have been your husband and you loved me." He said bending over looking at the ground rubbing his hands together.  "If it was you in Austin's place, would you want him taking your wife even though death had already claimed her?" I asked him seeing.  "I think the dead should be with the dead and the live ones with the live ones." He told me vanishing into a white sparkling mist.  "Damn you!" I whispered to myself and left.  Michael the leader of the dark side stood silently watching us argue and leave Washington separately. He smiled vanishing into a black sparkling mist.  I was fuming when I got back to the house and Anoki sat on the couch with his paws covering his eyes. I stormed past him going to my bedroom when I had just had enough. I sat on the bed crying, Anoki came slowly into the room not knowing what to do.  "When you died I didn't know what to do, I was lost without you and pregnant, and Austin helped me. You told me to marry him, and now you condemn me for loving him." I told him crying. I felt his head on my shoulder. He was whimpering like a puppy. And I couldn't help but to laugh at him.  Troy sat next to me but not as Anoki and licked my face. He burst into laughter from the expression of pure disgust.  "Oh gross you licked my face!" I told him wiping my face off with his shirt tail when Austin walked in and turned back around walking out of the room going into the bathroom in the hall.  "Austin wait!" I yelled jumping to my feet to run after him. I knocked on the door and he did not answer me. I then vanished appearing on the other side but he was gone. I looked around the bathroom but he was gone! I then saw the bathroom window open and I saw him walking towards the road. "Damn it!" I said and vanishing again this time appearing next to him.  "I am sorry I didn't knock going into our bedroom. I am sorry if I interrupted anything." He said walking faster down the street.  "You didn't I was wiping his spit off my face with his shirt cause he licked me trying to be cute." I tried to explain to him.  "I don't need you to explain to me." He said not looking at me but walking even faster when Anoki came charging at him and knocked him down turning into Troy.  "I don't know why your mad I am the one that made the ass out of myself by blowing up at her for being in love and faithful to you even in death." He said pinning him down on the ground.  Austin looked at me with Troy sitting on top of him. "Really?" he asked him smiling at me.  Troy looked at him. "Really, now don't make me drag you back to the house." He told him smiling. "I am sorry Montana for being a jerk." He said smiling and helping Austin up off the ground.  "It's ok Troy I am just use to Austin being the jerk and not you." I said smiling at Austin.  "Hey I resent that because I am only a part time jerk." Austin said with a smile.  We were given the task of catching a serial killer whose victims are young eighteen twenty year old females with brown wavy hair to their shoulders and all were wearing dark blue sweat suits with white stripes on the side of the legs and a white tank top with a matching dark blue sweater wrapped around their hips. It was if the serial killer kept killing the same victim over and over because the girls were all so close in resemblance. We had one clue to work with the girls were almost clones in looks and style of dress. We used Anoki to pick up the serial killers scent, we worked the case almost twenty four seven sleeping only when Austin's body was becoming tired and worn from the long days, but I had to catch this guy he haunted my waking consciousness I could see him except for his face. It started on the first case I was walking around the crime scene when I saw him almost in a vision that played before me. I watched him following the victim when she exited the city bus and she walked quickly down the side walk scared to look back at the approaching foot steps that began running when she did. She turned the corner quickly catching a quick glimpse of her assailant he was dressed similar to her except his hood on his jacket was up over his head blocking his face. She screamed and he tackled her on the lonely dark side walk and dragged her behind the shopping center holding her mouth so she could not scream when he knocked her out and carried her to a cubby hole behind the stores and taped her mouth shut with the duct tape in his jacket pocket. He had removed her clothes before she came conscious finding him on top of her raping her. She tried screaming and began to cry. And I heard him call out Wendy before he killed her by strangulation during the attack on her. After she was dead he began beating her corpse blaming her for him killing her that she should have been a good girl and not a bad girl. I now knew the first victim was named Wendy, I had her age range now I would have to check the missing person files and other cases files to see if I could track down our first victim. I spent most of the nights with Troy going over cold case files while Austin slept in our bed. I turned my appearance into the description of the murdered women and began riding the bus transit hoping to catch our killer. For three weeks I rode from one end of Broward County to the other end. I knew all the routes and drivers by the end of the last week when our boy found me.  You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings © "Wendy I warned you to stay off this bus and away from that driver." A mans voice whispered behind me.  "I am not Wendy." I told him trying to see his face but the hood and dark sun glasses kept me from seeing his face,  I exited the bus and he was right behind me, I walked faster and so did he, I began to run and so did he and then he tackled me to the ground.  "I am sick of having to constantly punish you for not staying home and being my good little girl! I only married your mommy to get to you now go to sleep so I can play." He said hitting me as hard as he could with his fist.  "Not this time scum sucker!" I told him throwing him off of me and on to his back on the side walk. People were walking by and not wanting to be involved just looking the other way.  Troy and Austin grabbed him by each arm pulling him up to his feet and removing the duct tape from his pocket. We had him and took him into the station; I had not changed my appearance in the car when he began talking to me from the back seat.  "Why didn't you stay dead? I killed you so many times replaying that horrible night over and over. I thought they would find where I hid you the first time but your still there in the attic where I put you that night I dragged you inside when you were letting that boy feel all over your body. You will always belong to me!" he said sounding so crazy in the back seat.  I turned smiling at him. "No I belong to God now." I told him and returned to looking like Koko.  "Wendy come back!" he cried sounding as if he were in agony.  I assumed that by turning into Koko broke the obsession that she lived in his sick mind. We had to investigate an eighty year old woman on suspicion of murdering a young mother and the woman's mother over the elderly woman's obsession with the eighteen month old child. Her name is Ruby Thomas and she took into her home an expectant mother named Liza and Liza's mother Judy who were homeless. At first everything was all cozy inside the home. The elderly Ruby made them feel like family until the birth of Jaime on Easter morning. A week after the birth Ruby began screaming at the young mother and forcing the child out of the mother's arms. As the child grew older Ruby became more obsessed with the child not allowing the grand mother Judy or Liza to take the child for walks. She would fight with the two women if they tried to feed the child anything but cookies and doughnuts. The young mother called the woman's daughter telling her of her concern. The daughter Brandy came over one day to observe what was being said and noticed her mother's strange obsession and how she became combative over the child even with her daughter Brandy throwing her out of the house and forbidding her to ever step foot on her property.  Two weeks had gone by when Brandy called her mother and she could hear the child in the back ground crying.  "Where are her mother and grand mother mom?" Brandy asked.  "Oh they took off." Her mother told her.  "Well I hear the baby crying." She told her mother.  "Yes they gave me the child for rent for staying here." She told Brandy.  Brandy hung up the phone knowing her mother was lying to her and went to check it out her self. Brandy parked her car down the street and walked up to the house and looked into the windows of the bedroom of the two women. She saw the women lying motionless, she tapped on the window and still they did not responded. Brandy grabbed her cell phone and called the police. She was shaking when we got there. When we finally got into the house we found the women had been stabbed repeatedly in their sleep. The coroner confirmed they had been drugged and once they were passed out from the drugs of Ruby's prescription sleeping pills, Ruby began her murderous rage to rid her self of any other persons getting in between her and the child who now lives in Northern Florida with a loving family on a farm.  I had dinner plans with Austin while Troy and Ariana were to watch Ricky. I began to pace the floor for he had not returned from the corner store where he went to get milk for Ricky. Two hours had past when he finally walked in the door. I looked at him and I could sense something had happened to him. Troy felt it to and was the first to be by his side.  "I need someone to go and locate my body I was killed tonight by a demon behind the store he threw my body in the dumpster." He told us sitting down.  "How did you come back here?" Troy asked Austin.  "A guy named Nicholas sent me back here as a warrior like you two, there were a dozen more being sent back too." He said when a white mist appeared.  CHAPTER FIVE  Nicholas stood in the middle of the room in a long white gown, long white hair and beard, with tan sandals on his feet. He had a golden glow that radiated around him as he smiled so meekly at us.  "Well my two favorite warriors Montana and Troy." He said holding his hands out towards us.  "Your Highness how may we serve you?" we asked kneeling down at his feet as he laid his hands on the top of our heads.  "We are going to move you all to a place in Alaska where you will train the newest warriors and keep the older ones up on their training every three months. You will go and purchase the land and the housing facilities and start working with these new warriors to adjust to their new lives." He said vanishing as an envelope fell on the floor where he had been standing. Inside was one hundred thousand dollars for us to relocate and set up the new living quarters.  The three of us vanished leaving Ariana with Ricky while we went to Austin's body. He was so mutilated by the demon that there was hardly anything left of Austin's remains. I turned when I saw a black glittering object in my peripheral vision to my left. She was huge and green with pointed ears and yellow stringy hair, her eyes began to glow a brilliant purple. We looked at her as she hissed at us as she had planned to finish feeding on Austin's body. What really concerned us was the fact that she was pregnant.  She leaped at us through the air when Troy hit her with a lightening bolt at the same time I hit her with a large energy ball blowing her and her unborn demon fetus up.  We reported the unfortunate death of Sergeant Austin Tyler behind the store of the seven eleven on forty Ninth Street. The crime scene was out there when they noticed the new Native American guy with me.  "He's my brother Tala he has come to take us home due to a family emergency." I told my fellow officers.  Well it went a lot more smoother then I had imagined with saying good bye and to my surprise Ariana moved with us to help take care of Ricky. I guess if you thought about it she was right a bunch of Angel Warrior's couldn't very well be responsible raising a child and orbing in and out to fight evil. So now we were all off to train the new warriors or fallen officers how ever you wanted to look at it.  We stayed at a resort in Fairbanks until we found the right place. We all fit in with the Alaskan people and Anoki was well liked there. We were able to purchase thirty acres of land with an adorable cabin on it until we were able to build the training compound. As far as the towns people knew we were with the Special Forces and were building a training camp. We didn't lie we are a unit of Special Forces just we left out that we were Arch Angels. We were different then most Angels we felt passions and emotions that most angels do not. I guess you could call us Supernatural beings, Good witches fighting the evil ones.  We had completed the training camp in two months, there were men and women's quarters, each room held two occupants. We made one large food hall where we all ate our meals having to look as normal as possible to the towns people, we had a school set up with class rooms, each class room held classes for shape shifting into different forms, learning how to orb, how to walk through objects and how to use their supernatural powers. We had an obstacle course climbing up and over walls that were twelve feet high, running through huge tires without falling. We trained just as if we were in the armed services.  By the time the warriors were trained and accepted their transition into their new life we had a new group to train. We had officers from the military, law enforcement, the F.B.I. any persons who were killed while serving to protect became Arch Angels.  I taught orbing and shape shifting, Troy taught transferring through walls and how to run up walls and ceilings and Austin taught them how to use their abilities to throw fireballs, lightening bolts, energy balls, And how to become invisible so not to be detected.  Ariana cooked the meals, inspected the rooms, and gave them their new identities and assignments. Troy and Ariana were becoming more and more involved with each other and Austin and I were closer then ever before. We had a heated pool built in the enclosed gym.  The summer days were long and the evenings turned cool, we had special blinds placed in the house so we could block out the day light during the summer months when the sun did not set until midnight and then in the winter months you did everything in the dark. The weather took some time to get use to one day it could be seventy and sunny one day or it could be rainy and in the forty's, I learnt to be prepared.  Christmas was great everybody celebrated, the carolers were treated with doughnuts, cookies or candy and sometimes fish pie. We all decorated the way we would at home. We all came from all over so we had a little bit of all the different countries at our Christmas and Ricky loved it; he received gifts, stocking filled with candies and Dutch shoes filled with candies. The food hall was filled with different aromas of food being cooked from baked salmon to turkey's being smoked, baked and fried. We invited the town's people so we could show them our appreciation for being accepted and from all the help they gave to us when we first started building. That Christmas will always have a warming effect in my heart for a Christmas gift Austin bought us our sled dogs, they were beautiful huskies and we took them out for the very first time just the two of us, I sat in front of Austin with his legs and arms wrapped around me and blankets over us and our fur parkas. We rode through the woods on our property and Austin helped himself to putting his hands inside of my parka and shirt to my warm nipples that became erect from the touch of cold fingers. I managed to turn myself around so I could gain access to his parka and began to obtain access to his erection that gently nudged the out side of my cheek yearning for the warmth of my mouth I began to orally pleasure him, it was cold and the sleigh we broke in nicely as I managed to escape my pants and straddled him as we made our own heat, the warmth of his moist mouth on my breast made them feel very brisk with an almost burning sensation from the coldness that seemed to intensify our passions that were building with in our bodies as my hips moved on him in a steady circular motion and than taking him deeper and harder into me until we both cried out from the orgasm that was sent through our bodies like powerful explosions as our mouths sought the other and our tongues tasted the others mouth and deep moans could be heard through out the night inside of our woods. It was one of the most satisfying rides I had ever experienced and Austin even made death an adventure. When we arrived back at the house to join the rest it was drawn to our attention that we each wore the other ones snow pants. I turned many shades of red at that moment and fell into my husbands arms as we laughed at being caught making love. It made our romp in the bedroom some how even more pleasurable as Miss. Elf had to find Santa's joy stick under the covers. Yes that was a Christmas I will always remember.  The last eight years has been great out here, we have a great fishing business on the side and we are getting ready to enter our dogs into the annual sled dog race. Austin and Troy have won every year and Troy has not been a wolf in a while since our female husky fell in love with him, but a human. We only shape shift now when we go back to Pompano Beach to visit and of course to track down a few demons who Michael introduced to the area.  Aliana and Bruce Trembly a newly married couple disappeared off the face of the earth with help from Michael and his crew of evil worshipers. We were running out of time for the bride who was still a virgin was to be sacrificed during one of their worships.Anoki and our sled dogs began tracking their scent from the church.  Aliana stood before her new husband Bruce as they held hands vowing to love only each other before God and all of their guest. They had just turned to walk out of the church as husband and wife when a dozen demons broke into the church doors; everyone began screaming as the grotesque beings ran down the isle killing people who got their way with lightening bolts. The first demon who looked like an over grown iguana grabbed Aliana who tried to fight him off but she wasn't any match for him. Bruce was also taken and the third demon that was all red with black stripes turned into Michael and slit the throat of the preacher who was feverously praying for his parishioners souls from this attack by these evil beings. Michael smiled as he felt our presence coming to the church and vanished before we could battle with them. I saw the evil grin on his well chiseled feature face and then he vanished into a black sparkling mist and I saw the smile on his face. I heard people screaming and we were able to kill three of the demons. I swore to avenge the deaths of the innocents who lost their lives that horrible day. The people were more fearful then ever as they witnessed the abduction of Aliana and Bruce and then the murder of their beloved minister. I followed behind Anoki soaring through the sky as an eagle with twenty of our arch angels as we raced to stop the virgin from being sacrificed at midnight. Anoki and our sled dogs ran through the mountains and woods as we flew over top trying to pick up their trail.  Austin and other warriors were at the church trying to get people help who had been injured by the demons and to make sure they were not attacked again by the demons.  Finally we picked up their scent in an abandoned cave in the mountain. Going inside it was almost magical looking with the crystal like rocks glistening and as we went further inside we saw candles, we heard people chanting and a woman scream a blood curdling scream, my heart raced fearing we were to late when we entered where the ceremony was being held. I saw Bruce lying on the floor decapitated and I remembered my own demise and we began to attack while three of our arch angels rescued Aliana as she lay nude on the alter to be sacrificed to evil I transformed into myself in front of Michael who smiled so evilly at me.  "Montana your everything that Thomas said you were." He told me touching my chin with his hand.  "Did Thomas also tell you that I have a pet peeve about decapitation?" I asked raising my hand to destroy him when he disappeared in the black sparkling mist.  I looked defeated, I should have been faster with my attack when I looked and saw a red rose floating down to my feet.  "Jerk." I said knowing it was Michael gloating over his escape.  Aliana had been taken back to the compound to be treated and to help her to deal with her loss of her new husband. I knew Michael would be back for her since the sacrifice had not been completed so she needed our protection around the clock. She helped Ariana with work around the compound and with Ricky.  We began helping the local police department to help catch a vicious serial killer that had through the years killed over forty women by hunting them down like animals in the wilderness.  Frankie Dajeck began his killing spree at the age of fourteen when he lured a school mate named Patty into the woods near the school and began hunting the young thirteen year old girl with his new shot gun his step father Rex had bought for him. Frankie had it all planned before school and had hid his gun in the woods. Patty tried to escape her crazed school mate by dodging bullets that flew past her head. Patty sat crouched behind a tree trying to keep her sobs from being heard by Frankie. Frankie crept up on his prey quietly not making a sound, not even breathing and he shot her between the eyes killing her instantly. Frankie removed a charm bracelet to start his trophy collection of the game he hunted and killed. The police were looking for an older killer never once did they even think it was a fourteen year old boy who they were searching for. Frankie put distance between him and the other hunts he went on, going into neighboring towns and meeting young teenage girls who were heavy and not popular in school. Frankie met Lisa a thirteen year old girl who was extremely heavy with red short curly hair, her face covered in freckles, with brown eyes. The day she met Frankie she was walking to school and he persuaded her to skip school with him. He knew the bright orange shirt she wore with her blue jeans and white sneakers would make it easier in tracking her in the woods that sat fifteen minutes from her home. Lisa knew she should be in school, but Frankie liked her where the other kids would just make fun of her at school. Half the time she ran to her classes to avoid the names they called her and to avoid the other kids who wanted to fight her to look tough. She spent most of her days in school depressed and scared. As the walked deeper into the woods Frankie picked up his gun leaning against the tree.  "You better run or die cause I am hunting fat sows today." He told her aiming the gun at her and laughing.  "Stop it Frankie your not funny." She said as tears burnt her eyes from his insult, she had believed he really liked her.  "I ain't trying to be funny, run or die!" He yelled at her so menacing.  Lisa ran from him with her heart beating hard in her chest, she kept looking backwards hoping she could get to her house just down the road when she tripped over rope that he tied across the path between the two trees. She was crying as she tried to get up off the ground when he kicked her in her ribs causing her to fall over gasping for air.  "Bye, bye little piggy." He told her smiling and pointing the gun down at her.  "No! Please don't please don't hurt.....  She never got to finish the sentence he had blown half her face away. He knelt down beside her smiling and ripped the peace sign on the black raw hide necklace from her neck. He walked away feeling victorious in his hunt.  By the time he was twenty years old he had twenty trophies in his chest. He would smile at them every night before going to bed. He married his eighteen year old girlfriend and they lived with his parents until their first child was born.  Fifteen years had past and Frankie was thirty five years old and working on his forty eighth victim. He and his family were up standing towns people; they attended church every Sunday while Frankie went hunting every Saturday.  It was on one of his hunting trips that we met the great hunter. It was my faithful student Wynona and myself we were dressed in white fur jackets, white sweaters, black shiny spandex pants and six inch spiked heels, we wore more make up then the women on the televised church shows and our hair got more teasing then any man has ever been teased. We worked in the red light district where all the working girls picked up their so called dates. Frankie decided he would get closer to his fifty mark even faster if he took us two girls with him.  We rode with him in his black Lincoln with black tinted windows. It made him look important and he kept his hair died black as not to look as old as he was. He wore a beard and mustache, and dressed like a lumber jack on his hunts. He looked at us smiling thinking that we thought we were going to a cabin to have wild sex.   You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings © "Ok ladies start running or I will kill you both where you stand." He yelled at us.  I began laughing. "Oh no please mister big bad man don't shoot us!" I told him mocking him to anger him.  He became outraged. "You bitch!" he told me shooting me between my eyes. I hit the ground, he looked at Wynona. "Run or die whore." He yelled.  She looked at him." I have a head ache you run." She told him chewing her gum.  "I just killed your friend and you want to be a smart ass?" he asked her.  "No you did not kill me I beg to differ with you." I said standing up with a huge hole between my eyes. His face looked as if he saw a ghost.  CHAPTER SIX  The hunter becomes the hunted and Frankie was not happy that we changed his rules to his hunt, he ran through the woods and behind every tree was one of his victims screaming and grabbing at him. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and head. He grabbed his ears to try and drown out the beating of his own heart driving him crazy. Wynona and I just walked calmly after him; he could not get away from us. He fell on the ground crying.  "Please don't hurt me." He begged us as tears streaked his face with dirt on it.  Lisa walked up to him and kicking him in his side." Say bye, bye little piggy." She told him laughing just as he had laughed at her and he felt the pain of his face being ripped away from his head.  Patty walked up to him. "Run or die Frankie!" she yelled at him.  He ran and ran and hid behind the tree from Patty when she stepped out shooting him between the eyes. He died that night in the same exact manner as each one of his victims did that night and every Saturday night for the rest of his remaining days on earth he was sentenced by us to live in the fear that he made his victims feel in the state prison mental institution for the criminally insane where he is to remain for one thousand seventy six years plus a life and one day sentence without any chance of parole. His family moved to another part of the United States where no one knew them or of Frankie.  We all felt good knowing we had caught the jerk and the women could breath easier now.  We began training our dogs for the up coming race, we had taken on three new packs and this year the women were entering the race along with Ricky and one of his school mates Johnny. Ariana and I were team mates, as were Austin and Troy. It was extremely cold that day, there was talk of canceling it if the storm was to hit us but they said it would be hitting in a few days, we were off and running, the cold wind was very brisk, the towns people were cheering as we came by them. It was exciting, but I had a vision of the storm and Ricky being trapped. I told Ariana we had to get to him; he was already three miles ahead of us. The winds began blowing harder as the storm had picked up speed and was closing in on us. We could hardly see in front us now because of the strong winds of eighty miles an hour; the snow flurries weren't helping either. Using my powers I landed Ariana and the dogs back at the compound and I went to Ricky finding them stuck by a downed tree. They were happy to see me and I was able to get them back to the compound and erasing their memory of any magic they witnessed.  I went back out with the other angels to help find the other towns people who were trapped by the storm that struck us without warning. We could hardly see our selves, but we came upon a small girl of three and her father who was fatally injured, he was slipping away and I laid my hands on his wound, a bright light of gold began to shine and the wound was healed. James took the father and daughter back to the compound while we went on to help more people through the night. The wind howled through the trees, we flew through the air fighting the strong winds and we decided it would be safer to stay in the cave we found and Paul invented heat so to speak for us, I used my vision to track any lost people who were trapped in the storm like radar and would fly out to retrieve them. We spent the night in the cave with thirty of the town's people. Austin took a large icicle and turned it into baked fish, breads and fruits. Everyone fell to sleep on pallets we had sent for from the compound. If anyone did have any memory of us as Arch Angels they never mentioned it, we continued on with our work from that day on. Ricky has since that day graduated and is an outstanding Alaskan police officer and one day he will take his place among the Special Forces with the rest of us. In the mean time we continue to battle Michael and all evil things that come our way. Well we better go before Austin forgets he is my husband and I will be forced to make it very cold in our room tonight. Come on and I will tell you more of our adventures we've had on the way to meet with him.

      Who I Am by Erotica_Writings ©  She walked towards me in her leather, her attitude was crisp like her words. "I am your Mistress and I demand to be pleased. " she said very sternly and then smiled. I had never actually seen a woman like her before, sure I read about them, but then I read the big bad wolf too as a kid and never met one. She ran her hand through my silky blond hair and grabbed the back of it tightly bringing my soft pink lips to hers. My heart began to race and my nipples began to get so hard and erect as she helped me into my black leather chastity belt, leather bra and my collar. I wore black leather thigh high boots with six inch heels.  "I will do what ever you wish Mistress." I told her falling right into my role.  She began to kiss my long lily white neck, making me feel quite warm all over, her hands ran over the flesh of my tight ass and she had me to get on my knees and to lick her juicy pussy. I had never experienced such a feeling before as she ordered me to my feet and we went to join the party that was down stairs and back to our husbands.  I kept looking at her during the party wanting to taste more of her. At one point at the party she caught me pushing me in the corner and placed her fingers in my hot juicy pussy and licked them. Looking back every so often to make sure no one was noticing her fingering my hot pussy. I placed my hands on her shoulders as I felt my wetness on her fingers as they glided into my pussy and out. She stopped and licked her fingers clean. I watched her firm rounded ass cheeks that were exposed by the cut out holes on each ass cheek. her leather pants were made for easy access to her body with the peek a boo crotch. she joined her husband who caressed those firm cheeks that I had began to yearn deeply for.  What was happening to me? I love my husband very much yet this woman is controlling me, my wants and my desire, the desire to have her making love to me.  She smiled at me from across the room as if we were lovers hiding our secret of being unfaithful, we were being unfaithful at this Halloween Party and the party theme was Bdsm. Don't ask me I haven't the slightest clue. Today at three o'clock in the afternoon I was telling my third grade class room good bye and be safe trick or treating and now here I am shy Kathy wants to do and be spanked by Cally does whips and chains. What has happened to me? I am married to a very handsome and wealthy plastic surgeon and I am wanting to fuck this woman across the room from me who is making my pussy so wet and juicy.  What spell has been cast over me by this woman who indeed delights me to say the least. I have visions of sexual pleasure with her and yet I have never even fantasized about women much less allowing one to touch me and yes damn it I want to fuck her brains out. Alright Kathy pull your self together Dan is watching and wondering what is wrong with me. Is my lust for this other woman giving me away with neon lights on my fore head that says leg licker? Good one Kathy now you are paranoid, there isn't any way that Dan would know how you want to run your tongue through this woman's sticky sweet juicy pussy. Mmmmmm the thought just made me gush more thick creamy juices from my pussy. Kathy stop it! Dan is noticing your erect nipples and the fact that I was actually beginning to sway my hips back and forth as I thought of licking her so very clean. Great Dan wants to dance. I wonder if sexual tension has an odor? I never thought about it before now. Mmmmmm it feels good to feel his hands on my back, my body pressed up against his. When I close my eyes Dan turns into Cally in my mind. My body and mind wants her just as much as I do.  I have to go to the restroom! Hurry, hurry did he hear me whisper her name as he touched my ass cheek firmly while we danced? I looked in the mirror as I stood over the bathroom sink just letting the water run into the sink. Who was this strange woman looking back at me? I am quite a looker for a woman in her forties, I still have a great firm body with perky tits. Shit someone is knocking on the door!  Its her! I know it she followed me to the bathroom! She is going to do me right here! Right now! She is going to give me that hot tight body of hers! Pull your self together and open the door slowly and act cool not like a nerd.  Oh gross its an old woman dressed up like biker Barbie gone bad! Ooooh No! that woman has to be sixty and dressed like that. Gross!  There's Dan talking to her and her husband! How will I be able to act normal around her? Oh no this can't be happening to me! Good smile as he introduces you to them, My her husband is very tall and well built. She kissed my cheek and her smell of fresh lilacs is driving me wild! Stop giggling like a school girl for Christ sake their looking strangely at you! Did I hear correctly we're going back to their house for fun and games? What is going on? Have we all been possessed by these costumes we're wearing?   I am standing in this woman's house, I am drinking a cock tail with her and her husband and my husband and I can't take my eyes off of her cleavage and those perfectly rounded breast as I sit on her love seat across from her. She is standing up smiling at me. She is coming over here! My heart is going to beat out of my chest as she straddles my lap and begins to kiss me using her tongue to go softly across my lips as her hand caresses my breast, I find my hands on her tight ass, Oh it feels so sinfully delightful. She is getting up and takes both of my hands leading me into a room with a bed with hand and cuffs attached to the bed with long chains. She is laying me down and begins to secure me to the bed. She removes my Chastity belt and is now placing a mask over my eyes so I can not see anything. I hear Dan and her husband in the room with us. She is in control here I hear her telling them where to be on the bed and where to drip the hot wax at. What have I gotten myself into? Their going to burn me with hot wax on my flesh!  Mmmmmm she is between my thighs licking my hot horny pussy. My hips grind harder against her face, I feel my husband and her husband both sucking my breast. Oh this feels so good. I want to shoot my hot juices into her mouth. What the fuck was that on my nipples? It burnt but damn it felt good to. She is telling them to drip it now on my juicy soaked pussy! I begin to tell them no and they turn me over so she may strap my ass for trying to be disobedient. Oh my that hurt so bad that it actually felt good. I want to come so badly into a climax with this woman's mouth. Will you please just go back to eating my pussy? I beg but it went unheard and I felt the hot wax on my swollen throbbing clit and I moaned loudly. Now her husband is dripping the wax and fingering me and my hips arch up at him as he drives me wild. I hear Dan moan loudly saying oh fuck me baby. What was going on? Was he fucking her? It made me mad that he was touching her and her him I wanted them both to belong just to me! Oh but her husband was making my pussy throb. Was that his tongue eating my pussy to my asshole? Oh, oh yes, yes, oh, oh I want to pinch my nipples and suddenly I feel hot wax drip on to my nipple. Oh, Mmmmmm yes, yes that feels so fucking good. Move that long tongue of yours lover! Now she is back kissing me with her hot tongue as her husband is eating me out, she is straddling my face with her cum soaked pussy by my husband and I lick up both of their juices as she grinds that pussy in my face and I hear my husband moaning. What is he doing? He is jacking off!  I wish I could see, but Oh her husband is making me want to come all over his long tongue as she grinds my face with her pussy and now her husband has stuck his hard throbbing cock in my pussy! It feels as if he is on his knees with my legs over his lap and he is pounding my Pussy and she is ordering us all to come, to come now with her as I drink her juices and my pussy explodes all over her husbands cock as my husband shoots his hot juices and hits me in the side of my face and her husbands cock fills me up with his hot thick juices. I am breathing heavy as they remove my blinders, mask whatever you want to call it. She smiles at me as she helps to remove the wax from my body which actually felt really sensual while they were removing it. We went home, I felt totally alive and closer to my husband. I still wondered who she was though this woman who I thought cast some magical spell over us. I smiled gazing out the window into the darkness.  It's morning already, I am tired, but I feel really, really good. I smiled all the way to school, hell I was humming as I wrote on the chock board. There was a knock at my class room door. I was shocked to see the dozen red roses. I smiled being so Thankful for a loving husband. When I read the card I was shocked. How? How is this even possible?. Oh I can not tell you the panic that filled my body when I read that card. I thought it was over, but is it? Sure is was fun last night, but I full filled my desire and I am comfortable with my old life.  It's over, right? I thought to myself as I read her note.  Your Mistress is who I am...  Remember to always say please.  Softly hold me,  Run your fingers softly over my cheek.  No not like that! I am displeased,  get on your knees.  I will spank you with my whip until I am pleased,  No you cannot escape me.  I effect you like a disease,  When you bore me then I shall leave.  Mistress Cally.  I felt a warm gush in my white silk panties holding the card in my trembling hand from my Mistress Cally wondering how she could know my thoughts and where I worked? She was truly bewitching.

      Transcript Of 'Pleasing Pleasure' by Erotica_Writings ©  Transcript For The Pleasing Pleasure Comedy Hour  Cameras zoom in on Pleasing Pleasure as she enters the stage sucking on a dildo, dressed in a very tiny swimsuit, spiked heels and her long blonde hair hanging loosely.  Pleasing Pleasure: In case anyone is wondering why I am sucking on this big huge dildo it's because my doctor told me I needed plenty of protein, so I asked him could I drink it and he pulls his pants down and said I could suck on his straw. So when I left I went to the adult video store where I found this one hanging all by it self. The man behind the counter insisted that his would be better then this one for protein, but I am not stupid he just wanted me to buy his that shriveled up as soon as I sucked it dry. The amazing thing with this one I can carry it with me, suck when ever I want to on it and I never taste its salty cum that my doctor kept yelling "Drink my cum!" I did and it tasted like all salt.  The other day I was walking home when I hear this man yelling come on Pleasure me! Its not everyday I meet someone with a unique name as my own so of course I run up to her grab her hand and said Pleasure Me I am Pleasing Pleasure. The next thing I knew this guy is pulling down his pants with a huge cock, she flees leaving me there to drink more protein.  Audience laughs  I was in a supermarket the other day and this old dude yells in my ear which just about made my heart jump out of my fucking chest, he says "Did you see this?" I am now looking around ready to nose dive just encase ya know? He is trying to sell me a fucking toilet bowl cleaner. Since they came down on the Telemarketer, now they have moved on to the supermarkets. I was really agitated now, my eyes are bulging, I feel my hair standing up on ends, I begin to shake . I mean I am shopping for what I want to buy, and then I am being bombarded with this line of people pushing samples at me... Try mine, no mine! Leave ,me the fuck alone when I am shopping! I have enough pressure trying to be the great mom and choosing the right fucking peanut butter. God forbid should you bring home the wrong peanut butter because then you got little Ashley kicking you in the chin and calling 911 for child abuse. I remember when my kids tried that shit on me, hell I dialed the 911, ran to their rooms gave them their clothes in bags along with the bill for the stuff I had bought, and then started dialing my friends telling them it was *PARTY TIME* I had just been granted a pardon. You know kids don't like that either, they don't like knowing hey they are happy I am gone, yes kiddies that means we save money, don't have to use a pay phone anymore when I have five lines in the house that only one kid has five of his friends on, and I can watch my programs in the living room with my friends sprawled on my furniture!  Audience laughs and applauds  The other day I came home from work and my daughter is in the living room, I told her three times to be careful that I just washed the floor and cleaned the sliding glass door. She ignored me and sees the handsome pool boy outside. This is the only time I ever see this girl move as fast as she does when the opposite sex is around and then it happened boom! Runs into the sliding glass door which causes her to run backwards, hitting the wet tile floor and boom on her butt. I tried not to show my enjoyment to her embarrassment since the pool guys face was now like plastered to the glass door, She screams at me that I should have warned her. *Hello* do I speak a fucking foreign language here or what?  Show cuts to a commercial break and returns with Pleasing Pleasure sitting on a stool.  So we are coming to the end of the show now, and my last words on Pleasure is me. Thank you and you're a great audience.  Pleasing Pleasure bows and leaves stage.

      Tragedy Strikes Here by Erotica_Writings ©  Melissa, a stunning blond of thirty years of age, divorced with two small children, she works in a truck stop, her hour glass figure compliments the pink and white waitresses' uniform with her even tan, her hair pulled up into a pony tail the men watch her every step in her white sneakers as she hustles to serve these hungry truckers their food. Her crystal blue eyes sparkle as much as her smile when she speaks.  Leona a tall, thin, brunette, with big brown eyes, shares a mobile home with Melissa. "Did you finish that movie last night?" She asked pouring coffee into the trucker's cup that was sneaking a peak at her small breast under her uniform fantasizing about her licking his hardened shaft slowly around the head and down the shaft.  Melissa stands behind the counter listening to the sound of clanking dishes, people talking and laughing, she wished she could wiggle her nose and her troubles would be over with. "I tried to, but I ended up falling to sleep on the couch." She told her watching the trucker's hand moving over his crotch as he watched Leona, weirdo. She thought to herself.  Leona smiled at Melissa when she realized what she was looking at. "How do you like it?" she asked the trucker who was ready to explode his juices in front of God and everyone around him. His erection suddenly left as he thought he was caught jacking off discreetly in front of the whole truck stop.  "Like what?" he asked.  "Why your breakfast silly." She asked smiling at him knowing she had ruined his fun for him.  Damned bitch. He thought to him self. "Fine. It's fine." He said in an agitated voice and then he left abruptly.  "Wonder if it was something I said?" she asked Melissa who was laughing at the frustrated trucker.  "Po thang, the old mean waitress ruined his oozing all over himself." She told Leona teasingly. Leona smiled wickedly at Melissa running her tongue slowly over her lips. "He can't touch this, want too?" She asked laughingly.  "You tease you wicked wench." Melissa said as she sat a plate in front of a huge trucker with long black hair, a beard, wearing a white shirt, jeans, a brown leather belt with the words *kick ass* on the back, he wore black western boots.  "You two ladies can use the bed in my rig, Want too? "He asked playfully. Melissa leaned over the counter exposing her cleavage to him.  "Maybe some other time and you can watch." She told him touching his beard.  "All right you two whores get back to work." Mike their boss yelled from the kitchen as he had been listening and watching Melissa's ass as she bent over the counter. He smiled wishing his wife had to leave for the week end so he could get Melissa to come over to make his bed with him still in it. Mike had just turned fifty – five years old, he was short, over weight, with black receding hair, he always looked sweaty. He wiped his hands on the white apron he wore over his white T – shirt and black checkered chef pants that he wore his black dress shoes with. He smiled as he had thoughts of him inside her plump rounded ass. "Man is it hot in here." He said wiping the sweat off of his brow.  Melissa's heart began to race when she saw the big yellow rig pull into the parking lot. Her hands began to shake when she saw Jeff climbing down from the cab; he looked delicious dressed in a black muscle shirt, black tight jeans, a black leather belt with a wide silver belt buckle with a naked woman engraved into it, black shiny boots with silver cleats. His long black hair flowed freely in the breeze; he was very muscular built with a six-foot four frame. Melissa felt butterflies in her stomach. Oh God he's so hot. She thought to her self.  "Morning darling." He said sitting down in front of her.  "Morning Hon., what can I get for you?" she asked looking into his pitch black eyes.  "Why shoot little lady, I'll take you to go." He told her smiling like a shy little boy.  "Watch it or I'll pack myself up right now." She told him pouring coffee into his cup hoping her hand would not start shaking.  "What you haven't started climbing into that to go bag?" he asked her smiling so charmingly at her melting her heart even more.  Melissa tried to keep her cool, but she had fallen in love with him the first time she laid eyes on him." I tried, but the Dern thing ripped." She told him putting her hands on hips laughing.  "I am staying in town for a few days, want to see a movie?" he asked her. Her heart sank thinking of class tonight. "What time do you want to pick her up?" Leona asked him butting into their conversation. He smiled at Leona. "Well. Seven?" he asked.  "Seven, it's a date." Leona told him.  The rest of the day Melissa was so nervous thinking about their date tonight. When five o'clock came they both hurried out of the diner and home to their two bedroom mobile home, they shared together in the country. Melissa picked a red silk halter dress that fit tight to her waist then flared out too just above her knees, a red six inches spiked heels that wrapped around her ankle, a red lace thong, she carefully shaved her tanned legs and bikini line. She stood naked in front of the mirror looking at her body that was evenly tanned from her and Leona tanning in the nude outside by their small wading pool." Not bad for thirty, with two kids." She said with both hands on her breast.  Melissa carefully applied her make up, she wore her long blond hair down and parted on the side, she looked gorgeous when she had placed the small red earrings on her ears and sprayed her favorite perfume on when the door bell rang. "The boy is early." She said smiling as she looked at her watch and thankful that her ex husband had the kids for the week end. She heard yelling coming from the front room, but it sounded like Mike's voice; there was a loud thud then silence. Her heart pounded in her chest as she quickly ran to see what had happened when she saw Mike dragging Leona's body into the mobile home so he could shut and lock the door.  "Melissa......." He said dropping Leona's unconscious body on the ground and lunged at Melissa.  Melissa ran to her room with Mike just inches from her. Melissa tried shutting the door but he over powered the door. "What is wrong with you?" she asked backing up into the room.  "You know what I want, what I have wanted from the start! You as my whore. Now if you think some hot shot truck driver is going to come and get that ass of yours! Fuck you bitch; I pay you extra money as an investment into what I am going to be fucking!" He yelled with his veins popping out of his head.  He had her pinned up against the wall with his body against hers, his hands ran up her thighs under her dress, he squeezed her ass checks as he kissed her cleavage. He placed his hand into her thong finding she was wet, in his mind she was returning his kisses hot and passionately.  "You're a freak." He told her taking his hard erection out of his pants. He turned her around so she was facing the wall and entered her anally. He became like an animal, as he pleasured him self with her body. When he was done, she dropped to the ground, he couldn't understand why she was crying.  "You wanted it just like I did Melissa." He said pulling her up off the ground. "I better not hear any differently either Melissa, it would be a shame if something happened to your kids and friend out there." He told her then kissed her good bye.  Melissa fell to the ground crying, she could not believe he raped her, he actually believed she wanted him. "Oh help me please." She cried when she heard someone coming down the hall way. Leona came into the room with her mouth all bloody from him punching her in the mouth. "Oh I am so sorry Melissa." She said dropping to her knees holding her friend in her arms.  Melissa cried hysterically. "He thinks I liked it as much as he did! He hurt me Leona. Oh God what I am going to do? She asked crying into Leona's arms.  "We're going to go to the police that is what we are going to do." She told her helping her to her feet.  Melissa began shaking her head. "No, he threatened the kids and you, no I won't go and put my babies at risk." She said crying.  They heard Jeff pull up in a white car." Oh no what are we going to do?" she asked looking at Leona through her tears.  "Go wash up, hurry I'll keep him busy." She said pushing Melissa out of the way.  Melissa hurriedly showered and reapplied her make up, she changed into a long white summer dress, with white lace thongs and matching bra. White heels and removed the only red earring left on her ears. She looked beautiful, but she had a sadness within her eyes now instead of a sparkle.  At the restaurant Jeff noticed the sadness about this lady he had come quite smitten with. "Penny for your thoughts Pretty Lady." He said as they sat in the dimly lit restaurant sipping red wine.  She tried controlling the tears building up in her eyes." I am not thinking about anything." She told him. "I really have a horrible head ache, could we go?" she asked him wanting to go home and shower again.  The ride home was quiet; she kept reenacting the rape over and over in her mind. I hate him; he is going to pay for this. She thought to her self as they drove into the dark country night, She watched the lightening bugs dancing in the woods.  A week had gone by since Mike raped Melissa, both women had not returned to work and their jobs had been filled with two other waitresses that Mike was now sleeping with. Melissa and Leona began to follow him, filming him on their cam corder. They had followed him one evening to a motel where they filmed him and his new waitress having sex in the pool.  "We got him now." Melissa told Leona as they called the police on the two lovers in the pool.  Melissa and Leona filmed Mike being arrested with his Mistress butt naked. The women stepped out from the room they had rented next to his, his mouth dropped when he saw them filming him. "What the hell?" he asked as the police led him away. "What are you two bitches up too?" he asked Leona when they walked passed the police car with him in it.  They waved as they were still filming him. Melissa made a horrible face at him. "Put your clothes on ass hole." Melissa told him walking past him.  Melissa and Leona showed Mike's wife the tape of her husband and told her of the rape he committed on Melissa. Maryann was a large woman of two hundred pounds, she was only five feet tall, with brown curly hair and brown eyes, she wore a lose fitting dress and brown penny loafers. Maryann cried at first watching the tape then went suddenly quiet when Mike walked into their home and saw his wife of twenty-two years with Melissa and Leona. Mike's face went beet red. He gritted his teeth." I am going to kill you!" he yelled lunging at them and landing on top of Melissa strangling her, and suddenly everything became black and silent. The next morning at the diner Leona was waiting on customers as normal when Jeff came strolling into the diner looking around for Melissa, but he did not see her anywhere around.  "Where is Melissa?" Jeff asked as he sat down at the counter.  Leona smiled at him. "She is cooking now." She said pointing back at the kitchen where Melissa was flipping eggs.  "Morning Pretty Lady." He told her. "Hey where is Mike at?" he asked wondering why she was cooking.  "Hi hon. I guess Mike got more involved in his food then he liked and had a nasty accident. He won't be back." She said as she lifted the lid to the large pan of stew she was cooking. I hope this isn't too bitter or tough." She said laughing to her self.  Jeff looked at Melissa smiling at her. "I have moved here, wonder if there's a chance of a Pretty Lady going with me to dinner tonight?" he asked almost holding his breath for her answer.  Melissa looked at him remembering the rape. She smiled at him. "I think the odds are very good." She told him getting another order out.  Three months had gone by since Mike's disappearance, Melissa and Jeff had become a steady couple and were even talking about marriage, Leona was working late at the diner when Maryann came in to see her. She seemed nervous.  "Something wrong Maryann?" she asked seeing how jittery she was.  "I feel like something bad is going to happen Leona." She told her looking out at the parking lot.  "Like what?" Leona asked her.  "I am scared just like I use to be before, well you know Mike left." She said to finger a napkin.  "You know he won't be coming back Maryann. He can't." She told her patting her hand.  "I know I am just being silly." She said smiling." Well I am going to go home and I will see you tomorrow." She told Leona.  Leona poured her self a cup of coffee when she felt a cold chill go through her body. "Oh something evil crossed my path." She said watching Maryann walk across the parking lot when suddenly she heard her screaming and an eighteen wheeler crushed her and never stopped. Leona was screaming as people were running to Maryann's crumpled body laying on the ground. Leona ran from the diner and to Maryann. She took her in her arms when Maryann opened her eyes.  "He's going to get us." She told her as a tear fell from her eye.  "No, it was a horrible accident. You'll be all right." She told her pushing the woman's bloody hair out of her face.  "I am so cold." She said then closed her eyes taking her last breath.  Leona began crying and rocking back and forth. "No don't go, please. Maryann don't go!" she cried holding her tightly until the ambulance and police arrived.  Melissa arrived as they were taking Maryann's body to the morgue." What the hell happened Leona?" she asked her taking her into her arms.  Leona was crying hysterically. "She said he was going to get us." She cried into Melissa's arms.  Melissa looked at Leona strangely. "Who is going to get us?" she asked Leona.  Leona became hysterical breaking away from Melissa. "Mike! That's who is coming for us!" She said looking all around her like a scared animal. "Oh God we're going to die!" she cried falling to the ground.  Melissa knelt down beside her." He's gone, remember?" she asked her friend.  "He's back! He ran her down tonight!" she cried watching the eighteen wheeler sitting off in the darkness with the lights turned off.  Melissa grabbed her by her chin. "Listen to me, there is no way in hell he is back and you know it." She told her. "Pull your self together Leona." She told her helping her off the ground.  Melissa took Leona home after locking up the diner. She laid in her bed. She could hear Leona sobbing in her room. He hasn't come back. He can't. She thought to her self. She finally drifted off to sleep.  The next morning Leona was still upset. "Before she died, she told me she was scared." Leona told her holding her coffee cup with both hands as they sat at the kitchen table. "I am scared Melissa." She told her with tears filling her swollen eyes.  Melissa looked at Leona. "Come on get dressed I will prove to you he isn't coming back." She told her going into her room and changing into a pair of loose-fitting blue jeans that had wide legged bell bottoms, a purple T – shirt that exposed her midriff, a pair of white sneakers, her blond hair she pulled up into a pony tail.  Leona wore a pair of black sweat pants and a long white baggy T Shirt with white sneakers. The women left to go to where Mike was. They pulled in front of the diner, the blood of Maryann had not been cleaned away, and I'll have to call someone to come clean it up. Melissa thought to her self.  They walked slowly into the diner, Melissa looked around remembering the night the three of them had put Mike in here, and they struggled carrying his body into the freezer wrapped in a large oriental rug.  Leona and Melissa stood at the small freezer compartment, Melissa with shaky hands unlocked the pad lock on the freezer and there was Mike's lifeless body with the bullet hole in the side of his temple where Maryann had shot him as he strangled Melissa. "See he isn't coming back." She told Leona.  Melissa locked the pad lock on the freezer, Leona made coffee while Melissa called to have someone to come clean the blood off the ground in the parking lot. The diner would remain closed from this day forward.  A month had gone by and Leona had calmed down since Maryann's death. Leona and Melissa became worried when Maryann's son by a previous marriage reopened the truck stop. They felt sure they were going to prison. Both women had jobs at a local truck stop when Maryann's son Ben came to see them at their house.  Ben became interested in Leona when he saw her. "I just wanted to let you know I cleaned out the freezers getting rid of all the rotten meat, you can come back to work there if you would like to." He told them unable to take his eyes of blue off Leona.  Leona felt the same attraction to him. He must be in his forty's Leona thought to her self as she looked at how firm his body was, he was six feet tall, thin but muscularly built, his hair was brown and curly like his mother's." We'll start tomorrow." Leona told him with an ear to ear smile.  Melissa and Leona began working with Ben, three months had gone by when Melissa and Jeff had set a date to be married September 12th at seven p.m. in the gazebo in the center of town. All the towns people. Truckers from all over were invited to witness their union as Husband and wife.  September twelfth, 2003 had finally arrived, Melissa was nervous for today she would become Jeff's wife. Her gown was a duplicate of Princess Di, her children, Andy Melissa's five-year-old son wore a small white tux identical to Jeff's and Mandy wore a light pink frilly dress, with light pink gloves and black patten shoes. Leona wore a lavender gown similar to the design of Cinderella's, a horse and carriage arrived with Melissa, Leona and her children whose golden hair shined under the sun light. Jeff and Ben waited at the gazebo watching the children walking up to the gazebo tossing rose petals from side to side, then Leona followed them and finally Melissa was helped from the carriage by her coachman dressed in a black tux and top hat, he walked her to the gazebo. The high school band played here comes the bride; during the ceremony they played *I wanna know* softly by KC & JO. Melissa looked lovingly into Jeff's eyes. The preacher announced they were husband and wife. They walked slowly toward the carriage when Jeff fell to his knees; he had been struck through his heart by a bow and arrow. Melissa began screaming, Leona and Ben grabbed the children seeking safety for them, and people were surrounding Melissa and Jeff. Melissa dropped to her knees holding her husband in her arms. "Please don't leave me." She cried kissing his forehead.  "I will always be watching over you Pretty Lady." He told her taking his last breath.  Melissa held his lifeless body in her arms. "Jeff! No! Come back! Please Jeff!" she cried to him as his blood soaked into her wedding gown. The police had to pry her away from his body so they could remove him. Jeff's family helped her and the kid's home. The doctor had to sedate Melissa and Jeff's mother.  At his funeral there were truckers in their rigs with their lights on saying good bye to Jeff, his coffin with his body in it was delivered in his rig driven by his older brother for Jeff's last run. Melissa cried seeing the big yellow rig for the last time with Jeff in it. Leona tried to comfort the children as they watched his body in his casket being carried by his friends and two brothers. The preacher who married them was also servicing his funeral. "We're all gathered here to see Jeff off on his last road trip from here to heaven, leaving behind his new bride Melissa and there two children, Andy and Mandy, His mother Pearl and two Brothers Bobby and Tom. We're going to miss Jeff but rejoice in knowing he is on a new adventure." He told the crowd watching the casket being lowered into the ground and all the rigs began blowing their horns at the exact moment.  Tragedy Strikes Here by Erotica_Writings © After the funeral Melissa sat on the front porch of the mobile home starring into space grieving for her husband." Why did he have to be killed? And who killed him?" she cried into her hands. "Mike did." Leona told her.  Melissa looked at her, "don't, don't start that crap, not now, please Leona." She said looking at her through her tears.  "None of us are safe." Leona told her feeling that same fear she felt before.  Melissa became angry." Stop it! I just buried my husband! Will you please let me mourn his death in peace?!" she yelled and ran into the mobile home and into her room.  Leona cried fearing the end was just around the corner for all of them." She doesn't believe me. Oh God what can I do to save us from him?" she asked looking out at the trees across the highway as tears streaked her face.  A month had past since Jeff's murder and still there weren't any clues to his murderer. Melissa and Leona had just pulled into the truck stop and walking across the parking lot when they saw a black rig barreling down on them. Leona began screaming seeing Maryann's body flying up into the air. Melissa grabbed her pulling her across the parking lot with her, the huge truck trampled over the pumps causing an explosion to toss Melissa and Leona through the air. Ben ran outside in total disbelief of what he had just witnessed along with the rig still barreling down the road with flames coming from it. "What the hell?" he asked not knowing what to make of this and believing Leona that Mike had returned from the dead.  At the hospital Melissa had suffered a compound fracture to her left leg, and Leona's left arm was broken in three different places. Ben stayed at their mobile home to help protect them, even though none of them knew how to fight something already dead. Melissa was at her wit's end. "I refuse to let him win damn it!" she told Leona and Ben as they sat on the porch. They heard the engine of the eighteen wheeler coming down the highway.  "Quick get the kids and get out of here!" Melissa yelled trying to get out of her chair. Leona grabbed the children as Ben lifted Melissa into his arms and carried her to the car. Ben had just started the car when the eighteen wheeler came crashing through the mobile home. Throwing the car into drive, he quickly sped away with the huge truck on their tail. The children were screaming and crying as the huge truck was inches from their bumper. Leona was crying as she watched the truck from hell coming for them, Melissa could not believe her eyes when she saw another rig coming toward them, it was Jeff's and it sparkled brightly. Ben pulled the car over into a field as they watched the battle of the two eighteen wheelers and the winner gives them life or death.  The two huge rigs faced off on the road, their engines roaring loud, the sound was almost like two huge monsters screeching at each other. Then they began rolling slowly toward each other, until they were only inches from one another and then they slammed into each other, they kept this up until Jeff's truck could no longer start again, the black truck bearing down on him. The engine kept dying as he tried to start it, Melissa stood outside of the car screaming when the trucks collided into one large ball of fire. They were all silent as they watch the fire burning brighter and higher into the air, when the black truck came out of the flames directly at them. Melissa jumped into the car as they began speeding away from the devils truck.  "He's going to kill us!" Leona cried holding both children in her arms as the huge rig barred down on them and slammed into the rear end of the car, Ben tried to hold the car on the road. Up a head he saw the cliff coming up quick, he prayed he could manage to make the huge rig to go over the edge.  The huge rig had its bumper against the cars bumper pushing the car toward the edge of the cliff, everyone in the car was screaming, Ben had his foot tightly on the brakes, but the car was still heading toward the edge and then it soared through the air and burst into flames.  Melissa woke up seeing a bright light over head.  "We're alive." She said touching her face.  "I am sorry Melissa you didn't make it." Mike said laughing evilly as he drove away with her in his rig.

      The Private Dance by Erotica_Writings ©   Oh yes she thinks she is so fine and she's gonna blow your mind, she begins to dance in front of you to get your attention as she runs her hands over her body to turn you on. She has just what you need to make you stay all night long as she is plying you with drinks and making sure she gets that dollar so she can pay her rent. She rolls around on your table top looking so sexy smiling and touching her body slowly as she never takes her eyes from yours and your eyes follow her hands over her big gorgeous breast, down her stomach watching her flesh break out with goose bumps as she slowly runs her fingers down to her thong. Smiling she spins her body around so she can wrap her legs around your head bringing you in close enough so you can smell her sweet juicy pussy that you want so badly. Laughing she spins her body off of your table as another dancer slowly pours water over her head as you watch getting hard watching the water streams running so slowly over her breast watching the other girl licking the water off of her neck, down her chest stopping just before her hard nipples.  She turns her back to you and her ass cheeks begin to vibrate, bending slowing from her waist she spreads those cheeks apart with her hands as the other dancer is squatting in front of her wiggling her tongue and your cock is throbbing as she rubs her crotch as you watch them, wanting them. You do want them don't you? They tease you long enough to get you to join them in the private room where they are going to blow more then your mind.  They got you hooked and you want their ass up in your face so you can keep them filled with those green tips. Their bodies are rubbing against each other, you watch as their nipples touch, you want to taste them with your wet tongue. One is now in front of you letting you play with her thong, as the other one stands behind you with your head between her tits as she grinds her body against you. You become brave taking your finger into her wet thong and the other one whispers the price for the play. Thinking with your throbbing cock and the alcohol you pay the price where they remove all of your clothes as well as there's and one throws her leg over your shoulder on one side and the other sits on your lap taking your cock deep inside of her pussy and you moan as your tongue works the wet pussy stuck in your face feeling her hands tightly around your head as she begins to fuck your face as well as your tongue.  The one on your lap turns her body so her back is facing you taking your cock deep into her ass, ah yes, you want to explode as the other one has her body moving in such a hard, slow grind and her juices taste so sweet, so sticky and you want to explode your cum in the ones ass as she plays with her wet swollen clit. She keeps her hips moving in one steady movement as your cock grows larger and harder inside of her ass. You feel your cock getting ready to explode hard and deep as their tongues are in each others mouth and your face in buried deep into her pussy as she rubs her swollen throbbing clit all over your face and trying to fuck your nose with that steaming pussy.  Your tongue is trying to get deep into her sea of white cream that is running out of her pussy onto your tongue and down your chin, they both begin to moan, the moment is becoming so intense as your cock is like a volcano ready to explode as your body stiffens and a loud moan comes from the pit of your stomach as you explode. Both women are moaning and your cock is exploding its rich hot cum deep into her ass.  Silence is now heard through out the room with the exception of heavy breathing. The three of you look at each other as you begin to dress and the women kiss you good bye as they go into another room where they will shower and clean up before the next private dance.

      The Letter by Erotica_Writings ©  My dearest,  Today I have left our happy home that we worked so hard for, for so many years to make as we wanted. Those walls could tell stories of our life, love and sorrow we shared together. Do you recall the first time we met when we were only fifteen years old at the pep rally. Yeah those were fun times at fifteen, at sixteen you stole the first kiss off of my lips behind the bleachers at the football game. I can still feel your lips on mine today honey.  I promised not to get blue and start crying, it looks like that’s one promise I won’t be able to keep today. I am sorry I didn’t want this day, our wedding day fifty years ago to be sad. That was the happiest day of my life when you became my wife. We were eighteen and had the world at our finger tips. Do you remember when we made love Helena? Oh you were so beautiful in that white gown standing under the moon light on that balcony, I came out in my pajamas and two glasses of wine. We drank that wine giggling like school kids sneaking into the parent’s bar. I remember how nervous you were that night when I made you mine and we became totally one in our wedding bed. You looked so scared when I began to enter you, you cried just a little and begged me not to stop. I know it was almost a year before you felt those fire works, the night Benny was conceived was the first time you experienced your first climax.  I am ok my sweet angel, my bones just ache from growing old and tired but tonight we will relive that blessed night from fifty years ago just like we have every anniversary since only difference is we are apart so I will write it for you so you can read it when I leave at the end of our visit my sweet Helena.  Helena was eighteen years old when Jarred took her as his wife, an angel he saw walking down the aisle to become his wife. Both young people they danced around the floor for the first dance as man and wife, tears began to sting his eyes looking at his young bride. That night they were taken to the most elegant Hotel around town and that is where he picked her up and carried her over the threshold spinning around with her in his arms as they laughed and laughed. She went to the bathroom to change into her wedding night gown, while he nervously fumbled into his for they both were virgins on that blessed night.  They sipped on wine and then he brought her into the room in his arms placing her softly on the bed, she looked so fragile and small on the large bed and he felt a stirring in his loins. He removed their clothing so they may gaze upon the others body, her eyes drifted to his throbbing erection that yearned for this sweet body.  He slowly lowered himself down on top of his new bride and their kisses ignited a red-hot passion in both of their bodies. His fingers traced her face, around her jaw line down her neck until he found her small tender mounds. He tenderly caressed her small breast, placing soft kisses on them while his erection throbbed against her thigh. Her arms wrapped tightly around his neck. He then had his hand follow her stomach to her soft patch of hair between her thighs placing his finger in her sweet, hot juices and they could not contain themselves any more and he entered into her virgin pussy, She cried out from the pain and he felt her virgin blood seep onto his cock from her pussy that he just marked as his forever more. He began pumping her harder with his hard erection, his breathing became intense as did the hardness in his erection that drove deeply into her. The desire and love he felt for her were more then he could stand and he exploded deep inside of her warm moist pussy.  Well my dear that is how we bonded our love together that night. I feel the coldness of this headstone that represents my precious love. I am placing this letter under the soil that covers you like a blanket and then I will lie down on your grave as I take my last breath for I am ready to come home to you my dear. Love Always and forever Jarred

      The Furries Revenge The Furries Revenge by Erotica_Writings ©  Greg Standish a forty year old male with a college degree spent most of his time in and out of prison for robbery to support his drug habit. He had a wife and family at home, but the weekends he spent with his friends, he met while serving time in prison.  Frank Harding a thirty four year old male, who makes his money selling drugs to adults and teenagers, he is an abusive husband and father to his wife and their three small daughters, their ages are three years old, four years old and five years old. All the girls resembled their mother. Thin, long brown hair and brown eyes.  Tim Engel a twenty four year old male, who works in a grocery store, he is single and living with his mother. He spent four years for the rape of a thirteen year old girl.  Mathew Tillinger a thirty six year old male, engaged to be married in two months, he owns a small lawn service business which most of his money goes to Frank for drugs. Spending most of his time in prison on drug possession charges.  Paul Kendall an eighteen years old male, unemployed makes his money selling drugs for Frank, lives with his older sister and her husband. Was sentenced to prison as an adult at the age of fourteen for the brutal beating and stabbing of his teacher who was six months pregnant. It was by the grace of God they both survived.  The men all looked similar in appearance, tall, thin muscular built, their hair shaved close to their heads, tattoos that supported the white supremacist. They all wore white T shirts, blue jeans with black belts and black army boots. Their only difference was their eye color which was either blue or brown.  As they sat drinking and shooting heroine into their veins, the more they shot up the more they laughed at all the people running for their lives.  "Too bad for the ones who didn't get away." Greg said laughing.  "That one Japanese guy, he flew up in the air when I shot him!" he boasted as the others were laughing at the poor mans demise.  Six months had gone by, they were still killing, and not being caught, it became a game to them.  The three Furies who avenged the deaths of innocents or family members gone unpunished take revenge on the criminals or a family member who was guilty of the crime. Their faces were pretty; they wore black and white paint on one side of their faces in the shapes of a star, half moon and a pentagram. Their bodies were perfect with wings coming from their backs; they wore a plan brown strapless mid thigh dress and brown slave sandals. Their hair was long brown dread locks and snakes wrapping around their bodies. Their bounty was the five men who had killed eighty people on their so called hunts and now they were going to be the hunted.  They stood silently at the foot of the bed of Greg Standish making love to his wife as the three Furies planted the victims they killed in his mind. Greg thought somehow he was running from the victims down a long dark road forgetting he was still deeply inside of his wife's pussy just as she was ready to cum he stopped looking fearful as he saw their blood was squirting out of their bodies covering him, their screams of agony were loud and penetrating his ears . His wife looked up at him as he was screaming for them to stop! He held his ears sitting up in bed in a cold sweat from his night of terror.  "Tell who to stop?" she asked her husband pushing him off of her body.  "Them!" he yelled looking around the room seeing they were alone in their bedroom as his heart was pounding wildly.  "I thought I was being chased." He told her realizing he actually had been hallucinating.  Every time he fell to sleep he would dream the same dream over and over for a week straight. It got to the point he was too frightened to fall a sleep. When no one was home with him, the Furies would appear before him pointing at him. He thought he was hallucinating, he ran from the house as the Furies looked at each other smiling. Their work would soon be over, the first task was to drive their prey to insanity, and he was almost there. He began to avoid his friends as guilt began to consume his conscious. He was walking in the woods when he began to hear the screams again getting louder as if they were coming from behind him, he turned to look behind him when he saw the three Furies walking and pointing at him, the look on their faces were intense. The victims that the men killed were behind the three Furies screaming and pointing at him. He began running through the woods screaming as they chased him, he was unable to get away from them until he stopped at the edge of a cliff with a hundred foot drop, looking back at the Furies and the victims they killed and then back at the cliff. He chose death. The only ones standing at the cliff were the Furies looking down smiling at the dead mans body smashed on the rocks. His soul was taken away screaming by the spirit warriors of the white light to be delivered to the Grim Reaper where he would burn in hell for eternity. The Furies were successful in their hunt, and now they were off to catch their second one.  That night they appeared in the room of Frank Harding who had past out from all the drugs and alcohol after beating his wife and daughters so severely the children lay in their beds as their mother tried to soothe them. She feared they would wake the bastard up in the next room.  " Please babies, I know it hurts, but we have to be quiet or he'll wake up." Their mother whispered fearing for their lives as hard as she fought him back when attacking the children. He would hurt them worse if he were awakened.  "Why can't he just leave us alone when we leave? Instead of making us come back home!" the five year old cried.  The Furies over hearing their conversation would make this hunt more intense for they were also going to avenge his family for the abuse he put them through.  Frank lay sleeping, his daughters and wife was opening the door pointing at him." Make him leave us alone!" they pleaded as he saw the victims they killed entering his room screaming at him so loud the glass in the house was shattering as they walked closer to him they began to beat him as their blood spurted out of their bodies covering him He woke up screaming realizing he had been dreaming as he looked around the room; it was the same as it was when he had gone to bed. Rubbing his stubble hair he laid back down to have the same dream over and over each time he fell back to sleep. Once again, for a solid week he was afraid to go to sleep just as his friend had been before his death. He looked away when his family came into the same room as he was in, he would quickly depart the area. The three Furies stood before him pointing at him; he was the only one who saw the Furies. The screaming of his victims he could hear in his head getting louder and louder. He held his head; the screams were so loud it felt like his head would blow up! He ran out of the house screaming, his wife and children thought he had gone totally insane. He ran down the side walk seeing the Furies, his family and victims chasing him, pointing at him, he turned into an ally where a gang was standing waiting to rob someone.  They grabbed him beating him with bats and chains. He watched the Furies, his family and the victims standing and pointing with such intensity in their faces, the victims screams of agony getting louder, he scrambled to his feet looking around at all the people in the ally, he saw one of the members with a gun. He grabbed the gun sticking it in his mouth blowing his brains out. The gang members ran from the ally and the Furies stood over their victorious hunt. They watched the spirit warriors of the white light delivering another one of the five men souls to the Grim Reaper where they would burn for eternity side by side.  That night they stood at the foot of the bed of Tim Engel's, he was dreaming of his ten year old neighbor. In his dream, he was raping and torturing her. His dream became filled with all the victims they had killed, chasing him through the store he worked in, screaming out from the agony of their deaths, the faster he ran the closer they got to him. They were grabbing at his clothes, cutting his flesh with their nails, he was screaming in fear of his life. People shopping in the store were oblivious to him as he begged for their help. The victim's screams got louder and louder, the people stood around laughing and pointing at him being tormented and tortured. He ran out of the store down a sidewalk he became trapped by a brick wall that appeared from nowhere. The victims pounced on him dragging him down to the ground and their piercing screams busted out all of the surrounding store front windows.  Waking up in a sweat, his heart was beating so hard, he thought it would come out of his chest. He felt his back burning; when he reached around with his hand he felt a warm thick fluid on it. He went to the bathroom where he saw the blood seeping from gashes in his back. Scared he looked around his room seeing nothing or no one. He sat up on his bed all night awake scared to go back to sleep. The next day he began to hear their screams in his head as he worked. He looked around to see if they were coming, but he saw nothing. That night he fell to sleep thinking he got the scratches from his bed some how. Once he had fallen into a deep sleep the dream started again, and ending the same way, only this time his gashes were across his chest. He sat rocking back and forth on the bed crying, holding his pillow trying to block the voices out of his head.  The next morning he showed his mother the cuts on his body, she did not see anything there, only he did. The voices were back screaming in his head. He could not stand it. He saw the three Furies standing beside his mother as she cooked breakfast pointing at him. "Look don't you see those creatures standing next to you?" he asked frightened.  "There is no one here, just us Tim; you haven't any wounds on your body." She told him in a calm voice. She feared he was suffering from a mental break down." Sit down and eat your breakfast like a good boy." By the end of the week he was totally insane. He sat in his living room listening to the screams. He would sit and just cry holding his ears to try to drown out the sounds that were driving him crazy. He saw the three Furies and the victims coming for him, he ran to the bathroom locking him inside. He heard them banging on the door, he coward in the corner hiding his face and head with his arms. He heard the door breaking away. He feared what they would do to do him he grabbed the sharp edge razor slitting his jugular vein. Before he died, he only saw the three Furies smiling down at him and that the door had never been broken in, then he saw darkness. His soul was taken away screaming by the spirit warriors of the white light and delivered to the Grim Reaper, joining his friends to burn in hell.  That night they went to their fourth preys house, Paul Kendall high on acid, he looked at the three Furies trying to attack them with a knife, they brought in his victims screaming at him, he was yelling and swinging his knife at them, he woke up his sister and brother - in - law who saw nothing in his room. The Furies kept him in this state of mind to quicken the kill. By the third day, he left running out of the house, screaming to the top of his voice as he was being pursued by the Furies and his victims to an eighteen-story building. He ran to the roof crying, he looked down at the street below and back at the Furies and each victim pointing at him, he cried the anguish that his victims and their families felt. He jumped to his death right in the path of an eighteen-wheeler. The Furies watched as his soul was taken away like his other friends.  Mathew Tillinger knew there was more to his friend's deaths then just committing suicide and whatever got them wasn't getting him. He left to go to the cabin where he'd be safe since no one knew about it. He sat alone in the cabin drinking his bottle of whiskey, he envisioned his friends sitting there looking as they did at their deaths, Frank with his brains blown out, Greg whose face was smashed in from hitting the rocks, Tim with his throat slashed and blood gushing out, Paul's whose face was half torn off and one of his arms dangling. They all sat around laughing as they did the first night of the killings. Except for Mathew he knew he could not escape from whatever killed his friends.  "You're not getting me!" he yelled when he saw the three Furies pointing at him. "You're not real! Fucking get out of here!" he yelled hearing the screams of agony from the victims and the only ones who left were his mangled friends. "Stop the screaming!" he yelled. It got louder and louder as he tried to drown them out. He took six sleeping pills to make him fall a sleep to escape them, but all this did was trap him from waking up as the Furies, and the victims were chasing him along with his friends through the woods.  They were telling him it was his turn to pay as they did. All night he heard the deafening screams, running and running, but always ending up back in the cabin standing in front of all of them." Nooooo!" he yelled as the pills wore off of him. He began to come out of the sleep, but the voices of his friends demanding that he join them in hell, the victims screaming in agony and the Furies standing in front of him pointing. He ran out of the cabin to his car jumping in it and leaving. The faster he drove the louder the voices and screams got, he looked in his rear view the creatures pointing at him were gone. He turned the music up to drown out the voices and screams in his head, but they drowned out the music. He felt as if his head would explode any second from the throbbing. "Stop it! Please!" he yelled and suddenly it became quiet. He drove the rest of the day and night until he had to pull over to sleep.  He was back at the cabin, the voices and screaming it was starting all over again! He woke up to silence in the cabin; he had to escape from here before they came back. He ran to his car driving out on to the high way when he saw three sets of feet hanging down from the hood of the car. The creatures were on top of his car now. The voices and the screaming began to start all over again. He floored the gas paddle as the car was swerving all over the road when he looked in the rear view mirror and in the back seat were the Furies pointing at him! "No! You're not getting me!" he cried out as fear filled his body. The voices and screams kept getting louder and louder in his head." Make it stop!" he cried out as he was losing his mind. The Furies remained in the back seat pointing at him, his driving becoming more erratic when he saw all the victims and his four friends standing in the road walking towards the car, the car swerved going over the cliff bursting into flames as the Furies watched standing at the top of the cliff smiling as his struggling soul trying to escape the spirit warriors who led him away screaming. They were taking him to be reunited with his friends where they all were screaming from burning from the flames of hell.  The three Furies smiled at each other taking turns kissing each other over their victory as their hands began to roam over each others bodies. Moans could be heard from these creatures of beauty as their bodies were filled with passions that were running wild through their bodies, the three were now on the ground in the shape of a triangle while their tongues were lapping up the juices flowing from their pussy's. Their tongues were sending uncontrollable tremblers through their bodies as their hips grinded each others face until the whole area was filled with their eerie howl of pure hot erotic pleasures. They sat on the ground listening to the sound of nature when they heard the sound of people dying and their souls calling to them for help.

      Strap On by Erotica_Writings ©  He was very handsome and very curious to certain sexual acts. He had been longing for a woman to take him anally, he spent most of his masturbating thinking of his dream woman all in black leather, thigh high boots, and she place’s his collar around his neck leading him into her private room with all of her toys for pleasure with the attached leash. She smiled at him seeing he was nervous being with her, his eyes widened when she picked up her flogger and began strapping her hand.  “I think you have been a very naughty boy.” She told him in an almost eerie whisper.  “Yes Mistress, I have been masturbating without your permission.” He said with his heart pounding in his throat and chest.  He heard the sound of the flogger snapping in her hand as she leads him to a wall with chains and hand cuffs. She quickly cuffed him to these chains and he felt her pulling his jeans down around his ankles, his heart was racing wildly now and then he felt it, the flogger smacking his ass. She giggled from his reaction of flinching and gasping from the shock of the flogger on his ass.  “Now are you ever going to do anything without my permission?” she asked and then again the flogger went across his ass with a slight moan from her lips.  “No Mistress, I will always ask first.” He said as he felt his cock beginning to get hard and he knew this could lead to more punishment.  “My, my is that an erection I see growing there?” she asked smacking him again across his ass watching his cock twitch from the pleasure with a smile on her face.  “Please forgive me Mistress, but I have tried to control it.” He told her so humbly.  “I am disappointed in you.” She told him walking in front of him and placing her hands on his masculine chest and squeezing it with her hands.  She smiled looking deep into his eyes feeling his chest rising from his intense breathing, she looked down seeing his now hard erection and placed it in her hand, squeezing it with just enough pressure that she could still slide her hand up and down the shaft as she placed her hand behind his neck bringing his lips to hers and kissing him so passionately and sucking on his bottom lip. His cock was throbbing and he wanted her so bad he could taste it, but dare not to make any type of advancement toward her for fear of the punishment.  She stepped backward smiling at him and walked to a table with her toys, his heart was beating wildly as he watched her placing her double headed strap on and smiling at him with a devilish smile as his eyes widened with fear for he knew what she was going to be doing to his ass. The anticipation almost made him cum as she walked toward him. He felt her behind him and felt something gooey on her fingers that she was putting all over his asshole. Her hands gripped his hips, then he felt the head of the dildo up against his asshole trying not to tighten up as she entered his ass.  Slowly she went in and heard his moan from the pleasure he was feeling, she began taking harder stokes into his ass as the dildo was bringing her dripping pussy such erotic pleasure as she fucked him watching him stroking his cock in the mirror in front of them. Now she was ramming the dildo deeper and harder into the two of them until they both exploded into a hot raging climax as his hand was stroking his cock just as fast and hard as the dildo was banging his tight ass. Cum was spewing on the tile floor as her knees were feeling so weak from the orgasm she was having.  The door opened slowly when an older, larger man walked into the room smiling. I need to feel some hot tongues on my aching cock from listening to you two in here fucking and moaning. She smiled as she looked into his eyes seeing the questioning of what was being said to them. He heard her laugh and un cuffed him,  “You are going to join me in sucking a cock baby.” She said taking his hand as the older man pulled his pants down around his ankles and then both were on their knees on each side of his large hard cock.  He was slow at putting his tongue to the mans throbbing cock and once he made contact with his tongue to the cock watching her pink tongue sliding up and down the shaft, then he felt her hand directing his head in front of the cock and the man shoved it into his mouth. First he gagged and then he began to like the taste and felt his own erection building again and her mouth on his cock now as her fingers played with her pussy as the three of them enjoyed his first threesome. He felt the mans cum shoot down his throat as his own cum was being sucked up by his mistress, his love, hearing her moaning and knowing her cum was oozing all over her fingers that he would lick clean for her.

      Sinfully Beautiful: Crystal by Erotica_Writings ©   Sinfully Beautiful series: "Crystal"  Crystal sits quietly in the coffee house sipping on her cappuccino thinking of leaving her lover in his bed sound to sleep from the six hours of erotic sex. Her mind raced back to the moment she stood at his door with her black bag hanging on her shoulder while her bodacious figure looked so hot in the black silk two piece slack suit with wide elephant legs and a halter top that tied around her neck almost exposing those large breasts of hers. He opened the door slowly smiling and she entered his apartment.  J.D. looked at her body desiring all 200 pounds of her, he took her in his arms holding her close, his fingers intertwined within her golden locks of hair as he placed the steamiest kiss of passion and desire on her full purple lips. His hands ran down her back to her plump ass caressing each thick firm ass cheek. They both were becoming excited from being together, and Crystal's thong was becoming damp from her juice's beginning to flow from her shaved pussy.  "J.D." she whispered into his ear as her arms wrapped tightly around his neck.  "Oh baby." He said kissing and sucking on her neck softly as he squeezed her ass even harder.  Crystal looked up at him smiling. "Let me go and change." She told him carrying her black bag.  J.D. who is a few inches taller then Crystal, with short black hair and dark piercing eyes could not get her out of his mind no matter how hard he tried to push her away it seems she haunted his conscious as well as his sub - consciousness. He began the music of the slow reggae love songs. He felt bad because when they first met he was afraid of what his friends would say about him being in love with this plump lady, now he only cares about what she thinks.  Crystal entered the room wearing a leather teddy, thigh high black stockings, and six inch black spiked heels, J.D. only had on a pair of black leather tight pants, and black boots. Crystal placed her collar and chain around his neck. Her attitude changed just as her outfit changed, she led him into the bedroom that she had lit candles throughout the room, the bed looked like some type of torture chamber with the chains and cuffs hanging from the ceiling and leg shackles attached to the bed.  "Lie on the bed you pitiful excuse of a man." she said in an even tone of voice.  "Yes Mistress." He answered like a scared servant.  "Give me your right arm." She ordered him not smiling as she locked his arm into the cuff and then his other arm and then his legs she strapped into the shackles.  She turned reaching into her bag and brought out the vibrating nipple clamps and placed them on her swollen hard nipples. Mmm feels good, She thought to herself. She saw herself in the mirrors along the wall and almost did not recognize herself. The sight of her dressed so wildly and the glimmer in her eyes brought a smile to her face as she removed her flogger out of the black bag.  She ran the flogger over his cock watching how it reacted as soon as the leather flogger went across his pants and then smack it across his cock and he tried to keep his cock from becoming erect for this would anger her and he would have to be punished. His cock grew hard under his pants and her purple lips glistened as she took notice of him being disobedient and not controlling his cock.  "So you think you can just get hard without permission?" She asked stepping up on the bed and holding onto the chains hanging down placed her spike heel on his balls inside of his pants and began applying pressure until he moaned from the pain and this sound made her wet in her crotch less leather teddy.  "Now, you will eat my pussy." she told him as she lowered herself down over his face feeling his tongue slowly lick her juices and every once in awhile he would suck on her clit feeling her hips moving in a slow circular motion as his cock was so hard. His teeth nibbled on her hard clit and she moved harder on his face that his nose was buried into her juicy pussy that was seeping over his chin.  Crystal wasn't prepared for the most explosive orgasm that erupted into her pussy causing her to scream out as she pulled the sides of her own hair as she filled his mouth full of her juices. She pulled herself together and stood beside the bed watching his cock throbbing and she placed the leather blinders over his face, she unzipped and pulled his pants down just far enough to have complete access to his cock and balls and then placed herself between his legs and began sucking his cock. He was getting so hot that he went into complete sexual release when the hot wax hit his balls. Crystal was leery about trying this, knowing she could cause serious burning to him, So she studied up on the safest methods and surprised him tonight with his desire to have the candles wax on his balls. Her mouth was so full of his thick rich cum that some dribbled down her chin before she could swallow it.  "Here is your check sweety." the waitress told her breaking her train of thought.  Crystal smiled as she paid the waitress and then hurried back to him so they could continue more sexual adventures together.

      Sinfully Beautiful by Erotica_Writings ©  Cheyenne moved her beautiful body so seductively on the stage at the BBW club Oasis, her long blonde hair hung loosely to her waist as she began removing her top as the men were cheering and whistling at her. Cheyenne allowed the white sheer top drop to the floor exposing her large breast being held up in the gold push up bra, she slowly moved her hips in a sensual grind as she removed the bra and tossed it into the crowd of men who loved the BBW. Her fingers clasped the gold thong that matched her bra as she teasingly, slowly slid it down over her full hips and thighs. She sweetly smiled at the crowd of men and then turning her plump ass towards them bent over to remove the thong from her five feet four inch body that weighed in at two hundred fifty pounds. Her large brown eyes sparkled with excitement as the men gazed upon her full luscious ass. She use to have a complex about being heavy and would never even change her clothes in front of anyone until her friend Cee-Cee introduced her to the BBW Club Oasis.  Cheyenne had her fans who sat at their tables near the stage watching her strut her stuff across the stage. One fan never missed a night and that was Roger, a tall, thin man with dark brown hair and brown eyes, who had fallen in love with Cheyenne the first night he saw her dance. She looked directly into his eyes and she slowly removed her clothes as if she was making love to him up on the stage through her eyes. He never felt such a burning desire deep with in his loins and had decided that night that one day she would become his woman.  Cheyenne knew Roger liked her and his jealousy over the other men she paid attention to really made him angry. He went so far as to threaten to arrest one man for public indecency.  Tonight Cheyenne was feeling extra naughty and decided that she was going to take Roger home for a night of hot naughty sex. She straddled his lap standing with her breast in his face rubbing her body on him taking his hands and guiding them on her body where she wanted them starting softly on her shoulders to just above her breast and down her sides looking so intently into his eyes, slowly running her tongue over her glistening lips. He could see the goose bumps he was causing to break out on her flesh and her nipples were now so large and hard that his mouth watered to suck on them.  Roger was almost scared for this is the first time she ever responded to him in the year he had been coming to watch her faithfully. She was really giving him her full attention.  Cheyenne was excited knowing she was going to take him home with her tonight. She could actually feel her juices starting to make her thong wet from the desire that was burning her very being.  Angela watched her room mate while she stood behind the bar serving drinks to the men who hadn’t any interest in this woman who practically starved herself to stay thin as society deemed acceptable, but here in this world of the BBW she was the one men looked down upon her as they lusted after these large bodied women that in society are made fun. She actually felt ashamed being thin while she worked here. She was watching this one man who made Fabio look like last nights left over, but he only had eyes for Cee-Cee who weighed three hundred pounds. The club was packed tonight and this really made Angela even more tense with all of these handsome men around her and not one was looking at her. She walked over to the one with Cee-Cee smiling up at him she leaned over the bar whispering in his ear.  “Hey baby when you want to feel some firm tight thighs look me up.” she told him lightly touching his chin with her finger tips.  He smiled at Angela. “ I don’t think so, your not what I like in a woman, maybe a few more pounds on you might help. He told her nicely and then added. “ You do have a pretty face though.”  Angela was steaming for that is what she heard her friends telling Cheyenne and never knew just how insulting it actually was.  Cheyenne was glad when she was finally able to take Roger home with her. In her bedroom carefully decorated with dim lighting and black satin sheets with matching pillow cases and comforter she helped him to be more comfortable and removed his clothing then fluffed the pillows behind his back. Cheyenne smiled turning on her stereo with mood setting music and began to dance seductively for him removing her clothes as she watched his hand caressing his erection and she slid her body on the bed between his thighs and began to suck softly on his testicles watching his ever so hard erection begin to throb and she removed his hand replacing it with her mouth. Cheyenne licked his massive erection like a lolly pop, slowly, up and down the shaft, to the head where she rolled the head of his erection slowly in her mouth feeling him wanting to explode deep down her throat.  She eased her body up over him placing his hard erection between her large breast letting him grind his hips hard into her breast, slowly she moved up his body taking his hard aching erection into her hot juices and moved her hips slowly on him feeling his mouth hungrily feeding on her breast that she began to move her hips faster and harder with him until they both screamed out in complete ecstasy. Her juices flowed over his now quivering erection as their mouths met for such a steamy hot passionate kiss. Roger became instantly hard again and went under the covers and began to lick her neatly shaved patch. Her eyes almost rolled into the back of her head feeling his warm tongue slowly licking her sweet juices as he pleasured her orally. He felt her hips wanting to grind against his face and his hand found his hard throbbing erection wishing he could explode his hot juices deep into her. He was really enjoying the taste of her ,he kept sucking her hard swollen clit until he heard her moan and now he was really stroking his hard swollen throbbing erection as his hot juices exploded over those thick thighs of hers. Unaware to the two new lovers was Angela in the next room listening to them having hot, naughty sex with her toy to pleasure herself

      Seduction at the Beach by Erotica_Writings ©  The beach was as hot as the young surfers I was watching with their stiff boards riding those waves in as the water droplets sparkled off of their muscular bodies. I had never been with a younger man before and I was quite shocked to see they began paying attention to me. I have to admit it made my thong quite wet.  Adam ran up to me with his rock hard board and I had an urge to lick the water droplets off of that tanned tight body. He was 22 and my 46 year old hormones wanted to help this young man into man hood the right way.  He sat next to me on my blanket smiling through his pearly white teeth and his bright blue eyes met my hard nipples standing at attention . His sun bleached blonde hair flowed in the summer winds.  "You are so hot Angie." he said leaning closer to me.  "Your sweet." I told him trying to fight the temptation of jumping his body right there.  "Come surf with me." he said rising from the blanket.  "I have never surfed before." I told him in protest.  "come on" he said pulling me to my feet.  We ran into the water and I felt so young and alive, his board it was hard to my flesh, yet so inviting to my touch. My hands slowly rubbed his long hard board and then I felt him sitting behind me with both hands on my hips, my breathing was becoming deeper from the probing of his hard erection against my leg.  Mmmmmmmm I felt him pulling my thong to the side and he bit my tight full ass . My hands griped the board even harder and tighter as I felt his body pressing down on my back and my legs automatically spread apart wanting to receive him into my now wet dripping pussy. I felt him biting my back and it sent tingling sensations through out my horny body. Shit! I wanted to fuck this hot bodied stud so fucking bad. My dream came true when I felt him enter my screaming pussy that was dripping wet from this moment of pure erotic sex. I did not care who might be watching our show of pure , hot, lustful sex, I felt his erection throbbing inside of my hot tight juicy pussy and I felt his cock raging inside of me, my nipples were so erect and swollen just as my clit was being massaged by his fingers that he maneuvered under my body to bring me into a climax with him. The waves were splashing over our bodies and I felt the throbbing of his cock harder in my now contracting pussy, I felt his teeth in my shoulder as my head raised up and my eyes raced into the back of my head as the most powerful orgasm rocked my world at the same time his hot thick cum soaked my pussy and his cock soaked in my own orgasm as the waves rocked our bodies.  I was in total awe of this young lover who made my body react like no other lover had. His body and cock kept pushing in me and I felt him harden again as we fell off the board and into the water together and my body turned towards his wrapping my legs tightly around him as he placed his hands on my breast and again we tried to achieve that glorious rush of an orgasm once more. We were like animals with passion filled kisses, he was able to stand as waves rushed over us and my hips grind hard onto his cock and the contracting of my pussy and the throbbing of his cock sent us into a stronger orgasm then before.  He grabbed my hand as we sat next to each other on the blanket interrupting my erotic thoughts of him, he pulled me to my feet smiling down at me.  "Lets go surfing." he said eyeing my body up and down.  "I don't surf." I protested just as I did in my fantasy and noticing the erection in his surfing trunks.  I knew what was going to happen and I was not going to stop it, I wanted him as much as he wanted me and the world could watch us because the thought made me even more juicier.  "I will teach you." He told me smiling at me with those white teeth.  My heart raced knowing what would becoming next.

      Satinka by Erotica_Writings ©  a tapping at the window, Tama lay still next to her knowing it was Aleshanee throwing pebbles at the window. Satinka looked out at her cousin shaking her head and turned going out to settle this matter with her. Tama followed behind her to make sure Aleshanee did not re-injure Satinka's wound.  "What are you up to Aleshanee?" Satinka asked her feeling irritated.  "I want to mate with your mate." She told her smiling.  "stealing someone else's mate could cost you your life." Satinka told her circling her cousin.  "You threatening me Satinka?" she asked her watching every move Satinka made.  "Satinka she is not worth you fighting." Tama told her stepping out behind her.  "No Satinka she is not." Kachine told her looking at her cousin with contempt.  "You want me Tama." Aleshanee told him.  "You're crazy, I only want one and that is my mate and mother of my children, not something like your self Aleshanee." He told her.  "Then she will fight me for you." She told Tama with a smug smile.  Kachine looked mortified at their cousin." You want to fight her because her man doesn't want you? You know she is still weakened and you want to fight her?" She asked her cousin standing next to Satinka.  "That's right, and if she loses which I am sure she will lose, our ceremony will be tonight." She said walking up to Tama running her finger down his chest.  Tama grabbed her hand. "Touch me again and I will forget you're a woman." He told her through gritted teeth.  Satinka smiled at her cousin. "And when you lose which I know you are going to, You're to leave this land and must live out your days in the dessert." She told her looking her dead square in the eye.  "Fine. "she said in agreement to their challenge.  Satinka smiled as her eyes began to glow purple, she magically changed into her white outfit that held more mystical powers for her. Her cousin backed up with her mouth falling open, eyes wide realizing she under  estimated Satinka. That her cousin was not just a mere angeni, but an angeni warrior. Satinka's face turned half white wolf as she began to circle her cousin.  "Satinka I was only joking with you." She said as tears filled her eyes like lakes.  "You challenged me, my man and my home. Now you lose." She told her as she raised her arms and hands up to the heavens and lightening bolts began striking the ground where her cousin stood. With one swipe of her hand her cousin went flying into the air, Satinka kept up her attack walking towards her sending her body flying through the air until they reached the river where Satinka smiled at her cousin. "Now it's time for you to cool off." She told her sending her into the river. "enjoy the water cousin. The desert is very hot." She told her laughing and with her powers her cousin was sent to live the rest of her days in the desert.  Satinka's mother stood at the window of her bedroom smiling that her daughter was growing into a great warrior. Tama picked Satinka up in his arms and carried her back to their bedroom. He kissed her softly running his tongue over her neck, he removed her top and began kissing her lips as his hands explored her breast, he removed the rest of her clothing and entered her body slowly with his hard erection, hearing her soft moans as her soft kisses to his mouth drove him wild, pinning her arms back over her head he moved his hips harder making his erection going deeper with in her moistness, her juices caressing him, he maneuvered him self so he was up on his knees with her sitting on his lap her legs wrapped around him as they rode the wave of the heated orgasm. Her moans were from deep with in her, her nails dug into his flesh on his back. They lay for hours in each others arms not saying a word between them just grateful they were still together.  Her cousin stood in the middle of the desert screaming out at Satinka to forgive her and not force her to remain here. She gathered wood to make some type of shelter from the heat. Satinka would make her stay for a month in the desert and then she would release her from her sentence.  Satinka sat on the bank of the river with her two white wolves knowing the time would come when she would have to go into battle against the evil wizards and Patamon's or all that was good would be lost. Her sister Kachine too would be going up against the evil breed.  Time had come for the two sister's to join the other Angeni's warriors and they would not be in contact with their family until they had completed the task of the warriors. The women stayed close to one another, in their camp were female and male warriors who were going to battle. That night as the camp fire flickered in the darkness the patoman's attacked the warriors while they slept. Satinka and Kachine had not laid down before they were attacked and was able to warn the others, the warriors on each side were throwing powerful energy balls at the other warriors that would send electrical shock waves through their opponent's body killing them instantly. Satinka and Kachine had the power to attack with deadly lightening bolts. Satinka and Kachine maneuvered their bodies so they tumbled through the air hitting the evil wizards and Patamon's. Satinka and Kachine looked around seeing dead and hurt comrades and adversaries. They helped to get the injured to medical help and their dead they held a mass burial where all the Angeni's gathered to pay their respect. Even though they won the battle they were sad for the family and loved ones who had been lost because of the war.  Satinka and Tama sat by the river that night watching the river ripples. "This is great to be able to be out with the black blanket covering the sky." Tama told her holding her in his arms.  "Yes and how many wars will we have to fight to keep our freedom we just got back after one hundred years?" she asked laying her head against his shoulder.  "Only time will tell Satinka and only the last one in the bed has to do what the other one wishes!" he told her pushing her to the side and running through the woods back to the house.  Satinka smiled folding her arms and vanished in a white sparkling mist appearing in their bedroom and laying comfortable waiting for Tama. When he burst into the room he began laughing as he was out of breath. "I let you win." He told her breathing heavy.  Their laughter could be heard through the night and by the evil wizard that lurked in the dark watching their bedroom window.

      Satinka by Erotica_Writings ©  Satinka stands by the river bank watching the water ripple while in her long brown suede dress with long fringe that hang from the low cut neck line exposing her well endowed breast, the sides of her dress were fringed and slit up to her hips, Her long brown hair flowed like magic in the breeze, she wore a single feather on her right side of her head, her brown eyes laughed watching her two pet wolves run and play by the waters edge. She was beautiful and medicine men, wizards and demons desired her.  "Time to go." She told her pets as they all vanished into a sparkling white mist.  Tama watched her without being detected he had fallen for her from the first day he met her, but he seemed to have a way of making her mad. He smoothed out his long brown hair and his black suede pants with white fringe on the sides of the legs; he wore with just a vest made out of black bear fur. And black moccasin boots  "I think you two need a home." He told the two white lion cubs he made to appear in his hands. Laughing he vanished in a white sparkling mist.  Satinka wondered who could be at her door as dark was approaching; no one goes out at night with the witches that wander around in the darkness. When she opened the door she saw the adorable white lion cubs in his hands.  "Oh how sweet they are." She said taking one from his hands.  "They need a good home and I thought of you being so loving and kind." He told her hoping this worked and he could get close to her.  Satinka looked around seeing night was approaching. "Tama come in darkness is nearing." She said looking frightened at the quick approaching dark clouds of the night.  "No I need to make speed to get into my house before the black blanket spreads completely across the sky, Would you give these two homes?" he asked smiling at her feeling a stirring in his loins.  "Oh yes of course I will, but you will have to stay the night I am afraid the blanket is to close." She told him pulling him inside and locking the door behind them.  Tama smiled to him self, his plan had worked and he would be here with her all night. Tama felt good about him self being so clever. He carried the young cubs to the large room where she slept; it looked so beautiful with tiny fairy's floating peacefully around her large bed with a canopy sprinkling their dust for protection through out the night. He helped her make soup for dinner. As they sat at the table he was admiring her beauty when he became clumsy and spilt his bowl of soup all over his lap.  "Oh how clumsy I am." He said feeling embarrassed now that he had a lap full of soup.  Satinka looked at him remembering the day he spilt red ink all over her new white moccasins boots. "Your mother should have named you Elu." She told him trying not to break out in laughter.  "Full of grace........cute." he told her trying to get the soup off of his lap before it hit the white marble floor. Out of frustration he cleaned it up with one swoosh of his hand.  She fixed him another bowl of soup. "Tama the soup will only full fill your hunger by putting it in your belly and not on your lap." She said slightly smiling.  He smiled at her as he imagined her being tied up to shackles dressed in a white animal fur thong and top as he took a leather strap across her thighs just hard enough to give her slight pleasure. She would moan from the stinging of her flesh making her wet and moist between her thighs. He massaged her breast watching her face change with the pleasures he sent through her body.  "More Tama, more please." She told him.  He untied her top letting it fall to the ground and pinned silver clips to each erect nipple making her nipples sting from the clips. He heard her breathing heavily from the pleasure he was giving her.  "Tama do you want some more? Tama is anyone in there? Hello?" she said tapping him on the forehead.  Tama looked at her realizing he now had an erection. "More.... Oh no I have had enough soup thank you." He said looking at her cleavage. God I want to fuck her hard. He thought to him self imagining her large breast holding his hard erection between them as he exploded his hot juices all over her full lips and chest.  "I will show you where you will be sleeping tonight; you can wear some of Motega's night clothes that my sister Kachine laid on the bed for you." She told him taking him by the hand leading him to the bedroom.  "They are here?" he asked not having seen anyone else in the house.  "Yes, they have their own floor which they live in." she told him.  "How many floors are there?" he asked her.  "Three floors, Mother and father have one, Kachine, Motega's and their children Koko, Mai, and Orenda have one and I have this one." She explained to him.  He followed behind her watching her firm, rounded buttocks under her suede dress. She led him into her bedroom, was he dreaming? She was going to allow him to sleep with her tonight? He began to perspire with beads of sweat on his forehead, his heart was beating rapidly. He saw the black and red striped pajama set with a matching robe and black house slippers. She excused her self while she went to her bathroom to shower and dress for bed. Tama's heart was beating wildly with passions of desire flowing through his veins. He noticed the shower door opened slightly and he peeked inside, he saw her standing in what had been specially designed a shower made to look like a small water fall, in the shower area was shower seats that looked like rocks and there were smaller ones built into the wall to hold her soaps and shampoos. This was truly beyond his wildest imagination. The handles looked like plants growing out of the rock encase shower. Her hands slowly washed her well rounded large breast. He licked his bottom lip slowly watching her take a shower. He quickly ran back to the bed sitting on the side as if he had been there the whole time.  He watched her emerge from the shower dressed in a long white peasant looking night gown made of very thin material exposing her pinkish brown nipples beneath the gown. Smiling at him she looked at him as she slipped her soft fury house slippers on.  "You may shower before retiring to bed." She told him going out to the patio with her wolves and the cubs. "We must go to bed now." She told them leading them into the room.  Tama showered and dressed quickly excited of taking Satinka as his woman tonight. He entered the bedroom where he saw her sitting propped up in the bed by her pillows as she read a book. Tama smiled as he got into the bed lying next to her when her wolf Maze jumped between them growling at Tama.  Satinka laughed to her self seeing his disappointment that Maze was sleeping with them. Satinka sat up looking at him with a very serious look.  "Do not try to seduce my wolf tonight." She told him giggling.  "Funny Satinka, very funny." He told her turning over in the bed on his side.  Tama felt Satinka soft kisses on his lips, neck, he opened his eyes and she held his arms pinned back over his head sitting straddled across his body without any clothes on, he bit her nipple teasingly that gently touched his lips, she maneuvered her body until his stiff erection was exploring inside of her slowly, teasingly. Her tongue explored his mouth, she sat straight up on him, and his hands massaged her magnificent breast while his tongue darted over her hardened nipples. Her low moans were driving him wild; he grasped her hips forcing her down on him taking her harder and deeper when she cried out from the massive orgasm. Just as he was going to explode with in her she stopped him. Smiling she rolled over and fell back to sleep. She would not wake up no matter what, but she kept calling his name. He opened his eyes and she was standing by the bed.  "Are you alright?" She asked as he was holding his pillow firmly in his arms. "You must have been dreaming." She told him looking directly at his erection.  "Satinka I apologize, but I have wanted you since I first saw you." He told her taking her hand into his." I always do stupid things when I am around you making you upset with me like the soup." He told her never taking his eyes away from her, he pulled her slowly down to him caressing the side of her cheek with his hand and then he placed his hand on the back of her neck and kissed her softly.  Satinka returned his kisses softly and then more hungrier and more passionately falling down onto the bed as his body slid on top of hers, his hand ran up her thigh to her inner thigh touching her wet moist patch between her thighs, letting his finger explore inside of her then sucking his finger slowly. He moved down her body tasting it and kissing her stomach, thighs and her sweet juices that ran from her and onto his tongue. He devoured her juices; he felt her body tremble from the orgasm that rocked every emotion in her. He heard her scream out his name as her fingers grasped the sides of the bed. He moved slowly up her body, kissing every inch of her, their mouth's searched the others hungrily and he entered her slowly, caressing her firm tight body with his massive hands, their breathing was hard and fast, he rolled her on top of him and she  rode him slowly, he bit and twisted her nipples sending a stinging sensation through her breast that was making the pleasure she was feeling more intense, more exciting sticking his finger in her anally her moans became deeper, she moved her hips harder on him, she started moving her hips harder and faster grabbing her own nipples between her fingers and twisting ever so hard until they both exploded into massive orgasms. She slept in his arms all night for tonight they began a new life together.  Satinka sat at the river with her sister Kachine, both women looked around and not seeing anyone went into the water naked. Unaware to both women that the evil demon Murdock was watching them swim and playing in the water. His skin was all red; his face was flat with a slight pointed nose, his teeth were jagged and had thin lips. He slithered into the water and as the women were swimming under the water he grabbed Satinka pulling her into his cave where she would remain with him until he collected her soul. Satinka struggled against him, but he was to strong for her to break his grasp on her. Satinka cried for there wasn't any way for her to escape. He kept her chained to a bed in a darkened room and fed her bread and water if she behaved. He would break her will so she would give her soul to him willingly.  Satinka was held by him for two days, he would tease her with bites of foods besides water and bread. He tried to break her spirit on the second day he left to gather food, it was dark when he was coming back, he heard the howl of the wolf and noticed that there was a full moon. Diving into the water he swam into the dungeon like cave to find a white wolf pacing back and forth, the shackles had been pulled out of the wall and Satinka was gone. Murdock screamed out in anger that his prey had escaped him and threw a lightening bolt at the wolf who reflected it with its magical eyes that glowed purple and at the same time vanquished Murdock to the pit of hell.  Satinka walked into her house where she was greeted by her family, Tama and her loyal pets. Satinka was wet from having to escape by swimming to safety. Tama fixed a hot tub for her to soak in. He was relieved that she was able to escape from her captor without harm to her  That night Satinka and her sister Kachine wore white suede midriff halter tops with fringe on the bottom edge, long white skirts with slits and fringe up to their hips, white beads with white feathers necklaces, a single white feather clipped into the side of her hair. White moccasin boots just below their knees with white fringe. Their mother and Kachine's daughter wore white dresses with long sleeves and boots, the same identical necklaces as Satinka and Kachine. The father wore a long white long sleeve shirt, white suede pants with fringe, a white band around his head, he carried a bow with white arrows, Tama, Motega's and Koko wore white suede vest, white suede pants with fringe on the sides, white moccasins,  they too carried white bow and arrows. They would have to chance going into the night to worship for tonight was when the moon would be at its fullest.  The family began their journey to the sacred waterfalls where others were gathering as well. There was a fire burning, sitting around the fire were other people who were dressed similar as they were chanting a prayer, a flute could be heard faintly playing soft mystical music, fairies were flying all around sprinkling dust all around. Kachine whose name means sacred dancer and Satinka whose name means magic dancer began a ritualistic dance around the fire, their bodies moving almost seductively to the music being played. This ritual continued until the moon was at its fullest when Satinka took Tama's hand pulling him to the center with her and danced seductively around him when they both turned into white wolves, their eyes glowed purple and they ran into the night to mate for they were joined together for eternity. Kachine kept moving to the music seductively blessing their union and blessing the conception to take place during their mating. The call of the wolf could be heard through out the night and Kachine dropped slowly to the ground in a ball with her legs folded under her body. The couple emerged out of the woods and everyone stood around Kachine in a circle with Satinka's eyes were still glowing purple even though they had returned back to their original form. The elders danced around Satinka and Tama touching her stomach blessing the birth to come. After the blessing everyone vanished into a white sparkling mist.  Satinka and Tama began preparing for the birth to happen in nine weeks, they built onto their floor a nursery with the help of the rest of the family. Satinka's mother began sewing clothes for the birth. Tama hung pictures of his family that had been slaughtered by the evil skin walkers that transformed themselves into black wolves with red glowing eyes. Satinka's belly grew with the life growing with in her.  Satinka stepped into the shower she had six more weeks before her birth. Tama stepped into the shower with her and began kissing her neck and caressing her breast.  "I love you Satinka." He told her as the water sprayed against their skin.  Tama was erect from the passion that he felt for Satinka. She dropped to her knees and began licking his hard erection, taking her tongue in circular motions around the head and slowly down the shaft, gently sucking on his balls as she massaged his hard erection and then sucking in deep with in her mouth, sucking harder and harder until his legs and body began to shake from the orgasm building with in him. He grabbed her hair with his fingers as the explosion that builds with in his body exploded into  Satinka's mouth shooting directly to the back of her throat. He then carried her to the bed where he softly massaged her clit with his fingers, Kissing her lips, neck and breast, he moved his body down between her thighs and began to slowly lick the wet moist area between her thighs, her hands caressed her hard nipples as the explosion was so powerful that Tama licked her hot sticky sweet juices with his searching tongue. He then mounted her carefully entering her with his hard erection and made love to her for hours until both of their bodies were rocked with one orgasm after another.  The day had come for Satinka to deliver; she materialized in her parent's room with contractions that felt as if she were being ripped apart. They summoned for the rest of the family to witness the birth, Tama held Satinka's hand as she gave birth to their first born Taima which means Clash Of Thunder after his father's name which means Thunderbolt. Satinka's mother held Taima cleansing him, the child was born with the face of half wolf and half angeni face as was his sister Nitika which means Angel Of Precious Stone.  The months had gone by and the children's faces turned into the angeni each day as they grew older. By the time they were three years old they had mastered transforming into white wolf cubs and back into an angeni. Rumors were spreading of war between the Angeni's and the Patamon's which the word Patamon means raging and Angeni means spirit angel.  The patamon's were the evil ones who wanted to destroy all that was good. Tama and Motega were called to battle the patamon's with the other younger males of the tribe. Day's turned into weeks and weeks turned into months that the young males were gone from their families, the families left behind made baskets of foods, medical supplies and weapons that some of the older males had to take to the men fighting. Word soon spread that Motega and Tama had been captured by the Patamon's. Satinka and her sister waited for word of their release. A month had gone by without any word of how they were or if they were even alive.  Satinka and her sister dressed in the white outfits they wore the night of the ceremony and went to search for their beloved men against the advice of their parents they left their home. Once they reached the woods they transformed into the white wolves and began to track their men by their scent. They found them tied to shackles in a cave deep in the woods, they were thin and near death from the beatings they had been receiving. With them were three other men. Satinka and her sister materialized in the cave behind the three sleeping Patamon's. Satinka and her sister began battling the men and transformed back into the white wolves as the Patamon's turned into gray and black wolves. They battled each other shooting beams at the other, a cloud of dust covered them preventing the men held captive to see  who was winning? Finally the fight had ended and the men strained their eyes to see who the victor was through the cloud of dust. Satinka and Kachine came walking out of the cloud of dust, Satinka had received a deep gash to her side from the battle. The women freed the men and they all vanished into a white sparkling mist.  At the house they doctored the men and Satinka. The men's strength returned after a few days, but Satinka had slipped into a coma. Tama sat by her side holding her hand kissing it and begging for her to return to him. Satinka was in a far off land wearing a long white dress that flowed in the wind and she was running through a grassy field with white wolves. She was bare footed and was so happy and peaceful. Her grandmother appeared before her dressed in a long white dress that glittered.  "It is time for you to return to your home and children now Satinka." She told her touching her face.  "It's so peaceful and beautiful here, I wish I could stay." She told her grandmother not wanting to leave.  "You will return someday just now is not your time." She said fading away as Satinka was waving good bye.  Satinka opened her eyes and Tama was lying next to her with her in his arms as he slept. She touched his face softly and he slowly opened his eyes seeing that she was awake. He smiled and kissed her softly.  "you have come home to us." He said softly.  "I am very thirsty." She told him wanting something to drink.  Tama began laughing for she had come back from the other world, back to him and their children. He held her in his arms tightly thankful for her return. "I will get you something to drink and some soup.  Her mother and sister cooked and cleaned for her for the next month until she had regained her full strength. During this time a cousin Aleshanee came to stay with the family and she wanted Tama as soon as she saw him. She would sneak off of the parent's floor where she stayed and would stand under Satinka and Tama's window singing wearing just her shear white night gown. Tama did not want to upset Satinka with her still healing. Aleshanee was beautiful with her long brown hair flowing freely to her waist, her eyes were like brown almonds and her body was voluptuous. Yet Satinka had a beauty that women yearned to look like. Satinka got up one night hearing

      One Hot Snowy Night by Erotica_Writings ©  Sandy looked at herself in the mirror in her tiny red shorts and matching top with her Santa hat sitting side ways on her head.  "Mmmmm how good we look for a forty six year old woman." she said smiling at herself with a twinkle in her eye as she turned her petite foot in her black six inch spiked heels.  She walked down the stairs with a fast bounce in her step as she was feeling very desirable. Her husband James looked at her as she entered the room with the rest of their guest. He was ten years her senior and she could still make him get hard just with one smile from her. He was tall and thin, his hair was salt and pepper, his eyes a sparkling blue. He adjusted his belt to his Santa's outfit and went to claim her for a dance to the song strength of a woman. He held her small firm body close to hers leading her into a dance of seduction. His hands roamed her body as every watched this very seductive dance between the two.  Jordan was also watching and his obsession with Sandy was now on a rampage through his body. He seethed with anger, jealousy towards James. His eyes fell on her ass as the short red shorts were cut above her firm cheeks that he longed to bite and spank. He imagined her over his lap with that plump firm ass receiving his spanks from his large hands and she wanted it harder.  "You want it harder bitch?" he said smacking her ass as hard as he could hearing her moans.  He took his index finger sticking it into her ass as she moved her hips trying to more of his fingers in her and he obliged her until he had three fingers deep in her ass. She allowed his fingers to go as far as they could.  "Sit up facing me," he told her keeping his fingers with a steady rhythm as she straddled him and his large throbbing cock entered her.  He bit her large firm breast and sucked on her nipples feeling her pussies juices flow over his cock. His cock was throbbing as he thought of fucking her. He looked around as he slipped off to use the bathroom to jack off his cock. He walked up the stairs without being seen and found himself in her bathroom with her white satin panties on the ground. He picked the panties up in his hand and held the crotch under his nose. He took his cock out and began to masturbate smelling and sucking on her panties. It was long before his hot cum exploded from the head of his cock. He heard her enter the room and he quickly jumped behind the shower curtain and he listened to her pissing in the toilet. The sound was making him hard again. He peeked out as she stood at the sink washing her hands and he made his move coming up behind her. He covered her eyes with his shaky hand as he wrapped his arm around her waist and began kiss her neck. She let out a sigh and her ass began to move against his hard cock.  "My James how did you slip in here without me seeing?" she asked.  He did not answer her but shoved her face first against the wall roughly keeping her from turning her face so she could see him.  "Ok I got it we're playing rape again right?" She asked getting turned on as he bit her shoulder.  The only sound he made was a low grunt as he removed her clothes by cutting them off of her and taking his cock out of his pants placing against her ass as his fingers massaged her now swollen wet clit.  "Mmmmm James I am wanting to cum." she told as her eyes were closed as she enjoyed the pleasures Jordan was sending through her body.  Suddenly as she was just about to cum he rammed his cock into her juicy pussy, her hand took over working on her clit as both of his hands gripped her hips ramming his cock harder and harder into her ass.  "I am Jordan." He moaned as his cock throbbed from wanting to spew his hot juices deep in her tight ass.  She glanced back quickly, yet her fingers worked feverishly on her clit. She wanted the orgasm he was building her up to, the thought of Jordan being her seducer actually turned her on even more and she gave into his rough thrusts of his throbbing cock and exploded her white thick sticky juices over her fingers and cried out from the pleasures that ravish her body. She smiled as they pulled themselves together. She turned to him as she turned the knob on the bathroom door.  "Until our next chance encounter." She told him as she walked from the room smiling ear to ear.

      Oh What A Night by Erotica_Writings ©   I am looking at my brothers wedding pictures and still cannot believe what he confided in me last night. We were sitting at a very elegant restaurant with soft music and a very charming waiter named Alexus, he wore a white ruffled long sleeve shirt, black pirate pants with a red sash and black boots, his hair was long and black that was pulled back into a pony tail, his eyes were so dark and penetrating with a very thin black mustache. My brother, who is a very huge muscle bound brute wearing blue jeans so tight on his ass, with a light-blue muscle shirt and white sneakers. I was his little brother very small and thin and yes I was always being protected from having my head flushed down the toilet at gym. I had grey hair that was balding. He had blonde curly hair, grey eyes and he just told me he was gay and leaving his wife Carol and their three kids.  This really floored me, how could my brother be gay? I sat silently looking at him like he just told me my dog died. I could not shut my mouth it just kept falling open. The waiter now is smiling at Paul as if he knew what he had told me, Son of a bitch! He did know what he told me because he was the one Paul was leaving Carol for. I placed my hand on my jaw to keep it from falling open again. I could only move my eyes from Alexus to Paul, Paul to Alexus as my head reeled from too much information being giving to me.  I remember the dream that woke me up in a cold sweat and a huge wetness from my cock. I was in this belly dancers outfit, ok I look like Don Knots dressed up in drag with these pirates chasing me through this pirates ship. Yes one was Alexus, my brother’s lover. He grabbed my hand pulling me to his hard strong body, flexing those tight ass cheeks and with those luscious lips kissed my quivering lips with such a hot passionate kiss, he sucked my tongue like it was my cock. I wanted this pirate to fuck me, to make me his bitch, I felt them stripping me of my belly dancer’s outfit and I stood naked in front of all these wild sex crazed pirates, my heart was throbbing as hard as my cock and then I felt myself being taken down to the ground and placed on my hands and knees and now someone had their mouth on my cock sucking and licking and then I felt hands on my ass and before I could scream from the pain of his raging cock going into my ass a huge cock slammed into my mouth.  Oh gawd I was breathing so heavy through my nostrils, the pleasure from my cock being sucked while I sucked another cock as my ass was being drilled full of cock was driving me wild with desire to fill his mouth full of my hot cum deep down his throat and just as my cock was releasing its hot thick juices deep into his mouth I felt hot cum hitting me in my face, my back, and deep into my ass. I had never in my entire life came so hard as I did in that dream. I woke up to my cock throbbing, cum all over my stomach and totally out of breath. I got up out of bed slowly going to the bathroom and cleaned myself up.  Now here I sit thinking about one dream that may have opened my eyes to what I really want and it’s not my girlfriend. I looked at my watch and was excited it was dinner time as I rushed to my car to have dinner with Alexus waiting on my table and perhaps a chance encounters when he gets off of work tonight. What about my brother? Well I am saving his marriage you could say, and perhaps one day he will be happy that he awakened my own sexual needs and wants. I fumbled with my keys as I parked my car, walked slowly into the restaurant and was seated at his table. My heart beat so wildly as he smiled down at me, he touched my finger tips with his fingers handing me the menu and my cock twitched.  I caught myself licking my lips slowly as I took the food off of my fork and slowly out of my mouth knowing he was watching me and my cock twitched more thinking of his cock in my ass.  “Will there be anything else for you tonight?” he asked me looking at my crotch seeing my cock fully erect and I purposely ran my hand over it letting him know oh yes there was more that I required tonight.  “I think there will be if you can accommodate me tonight.” I said smiling up at him.

      Officer Friendly Ch. 02 by Erotica_Writings ©   I was driving down A-1-A when I looked in my rear view and saw the blue lights behind me.  "Damn it!" I whispered to myself. It was still dark out and no one was around.  Officer Friendly: Good Morning  Blueangel; good morning  Officer friendly: How are you?  Blueangel; good and yourself?  Officer friendly: HARD again  blueangel; mmmmmmmm  Officer friendly: I want to fuck your ass get out of the car."  Blueangel; "Here? What if someone comes by? I asked scared to be caught.  He became angry. "Get out of the car!" he yelled.  My heart and head were racing now and when I stepped out of the car I was breathless, standing before me was this magnificent officer, but this time he was dressed in his uniform with a black leather mask covering his face and head. His eyes penetrated through the opening of the mask.  "Go to the back of the car," he told me as I walked briskly to the back knowing his eyes watched my full ass in my black short skirt.  I felt him behind me, and then I felt leather gloves on my skin and the mask against the side of my neck as his gloved hands groped my body finding my breast and twisting them slightly under the bra. His left hand moved in between my shoulder blades pushing me forward and I felt him pulling my skirt up as he rubbed my ass and I felt my black lace thongs being ripped off of me.  He yelled at me as he slapped my ass. "I am going to thrust it deep in you! Is this what you want, is it? Tell me now!" He yelled slapping my ass again.  I was shaking inside and yet excited too at the same time feeling his hands run over my full ass cheeks. I felt him bite my left cheek.  "Mmmmmm mmmmm yes, yes it is what I want." I told him feeling his hand push me farther down on the truck of the car so hard my breast felt as if they were becoming part of it.  I felt him spreading my ass cheeks apart and place a finger in my ass. I felt myself becoming wet from his touch and then I felt two more fingers explore the inside of my ass. A soft moan escaped from my lips. Then what I had been yearning for his hard erect cock was at the opening of my ass.  "There you are, all ready for Me." he said rubbing his cock with his hand. "Are you ready bitch?" he asked me.  "Yes sir I am ready." I said heavily as my breath was becoming rasp.  When he entered my ass we moaned and I heard him talking to me.  "My cock is deep in your ass!" he said grinding me harder and deeper.  My fingers found my clit all wet and swollen. I could actually feel it throb deep with in. He was fucking me so hard and then he took it out and placed three fingers in my hot juicy pussy and placed his cock back in my ass and then I felt it the orgasm was building to huge explosion.  "Ahhhhh fuck me sir, please fuck me!" I yelled out from the desires that were driving me wild.  My ass was grinding just as hard as his cock was thrusting deep inside of me and we exploded! We exploded into an orgasm of magnitude that sent shivers through our bodies it was so explosive. We finally caught our breath and he watched for a second as I straightened out my clothes and collecting the ripped thongs off the ground.  I watched as he slowly fixed his own clothes and removed his mask which made his brown eyes sparkled with innocence about them. I couldn't help the feeling of warmth that consumed me as I looked at him. He had that ability about him to make me melt with just one look. I loved pleasing him and was so glad I had met him that fateful day online. I can't figure out the hold he has on me, but he is my fantasy everyday that I awaken.  "What's for breakfast?" he asked smacking me on my ass.  "I guess what ever your making me huh?" I told him pinching his cheek smiling and getting back into my little white neon. I waved to him as I began to drive home where we would start our day like any other normal couple.

      Officer Friendly Ch. 01 by Erotica_Writings ©  Tonight wasn't any different then any other night on the internet, I must have spoken to ten men in an hour. Then I got the IM that changed my life completely. Sure I had sex on the net before and the phone with men online nothing really to write home about. Then he IM me that fateful stormy night. I was sitting at my computer in my bedroom wearing my green short night gown, it was around midnight when Officerfriendly2002 sent me an instant message.  Officerfriendly2002 hello  blueangel hi  Officer friendly what r u doing on this beautiful evening?  blueangel not much and you?  Officerfriendly2002 talking to you now  Blueangel so are you really a friendly officer?  Officerfriendly2002 yes I am, I can show you how friendly I can be. Lol  Blueangel I might just have to have you show me sometime. R u married?  Officerfriendly2002 no she didn't like how friendly I was. R u married?  Blueangel getting divorced  Officerfriendly2002 I am sorry if u r.  Blueangel no I am happy, I threw a party. Lol  Officerfriendly2002 lol well that is one way doing it.  Blueangel well I hate to go, but I have to get up early in a few hours.  Officerfriendly2002 ok I will look for you tomorrow.  Blueangel I will be on around 4pm tomorrow.  The next day I was on and so was officerfriendly2002, we discovered that not only did we live in the same town, but he patrolled my neighborhood. We discussed my car problems, where I could find parts cheap for my car and then I had to leave to go meet my friends at the marina to go on the boat. I showered and then I heard a knock on my door. I wondered who could be banging like that on my door.  "Who is it?" I asked behind the door.  "Police ma'am we've had a complaint." he told me on the other side of the door.  A complaint? I thought to myself opening the door slowly and seeing this massive police officer at my door, he was huge with his white shirt fitting snugly around his muscular arms, his firm waist and his dark green pants fit his body perfectly. I almost gasped from shear pleasure just looking at him.  "You say you had a complaint?" I asked him.  "Yes of loud voices coming from inside, is it ok if I look around?" he asked me.  "Sure come in please." I told him smiling as I realized I had on just my robe and towel around my head. Great I thought to myself.  He walked around the living room and then into my bedroom, I waited by the front door when he summoned me.  "Ma'am could you tell me what this is?" he asked standing over my bed where my clothes were laying.  I couldn't imagine what he was talking about. "Is there something wrong with my clothing?" I asked seeing him handling my gold thongs." I asked him.  "Could be, I need you to try these on please so I can see if they match a description I had gotten earlier on my radio." he said not smiling at all.  "Your kidding right?" I asked him not believing he was serious.  "Ma'am you can make my job easy by doing as your asked or we can do this the hard way at the station." he said getting irritated.  I began to feel scared, a lump was in my throat as I took my gold thongs in my hands and placing them on under my robe.  "Remove your robe and place your hands on the dresser with your legs spread." he ordered me.  "Is this really called for officer?" I asked wanting to cry as the tears burnt my eyes.  "I told you once we can do this easy or hard." he told me in a very firm voice.  I stood in front of my dresser with my palms of my hands on the top of it. I saw by reflection in the mirror the fear that was running through my body. He came up behind me and ran his hands under my arm pits. Thankfully I had put on deodorant I thought to myself. His hands slowly followed my sides to under my breast, I felt his hands cupping them as my nipples became erect between his fingers, he then ran his hands slowly down my sides to my hips, my skin had goose bumps and my breathing was becoming harder as I felt his hand on my ass, he then ran his hands to my thighs going in between them feeling the wetness between my thighs and placing his fingers between my lips, I felt a huge bulge against my ass and then I felt him take one arm and place the hand cuffs on me, then the other arm and now my hands were cuffed, but in front of me placing them on the dresser again.  His dick felt huge, it was so hard as he placed his hands my ass and rammed his huge cock deep into my hot wet pussy from behind, he placed his fingers on my clit that was swollen and throbbing, my nipples were hard and erect and my hips grinded against his hard body as we both exploded in a hot orgasm. He was still hard, this massive man was wanting more from me and shoved me down on to my knees pushing his thick throbbing cock into my mouth as I licked and sucked hungrily on it, he held the back of my head as I sucked his big hard cock I could feel him hit the back of my throat. With my hands still cuffed I wrapped my fingers around his huge cock as he exploded down my throat with his hot cum.  He picked me up off the floor and led me to the bed where he laid back as I sucked on his cock getting it hard again, he pulled me up on top of him and entered my cum soaked pussy with his thick hard shaft.  "Fuck my brains out bitch!" he told me as he pushed my hips down hard on his cock and I rocked my body hard on his cock, I felt his cock in my stomach, I was fucking him so hard. He turned me on my stomach entering me anally, I moaned from the pleasure of the pain and began massaging my clit, feeling the juices running onto my fingers as he pounded my ass with that massive body and cock of his.  "Fuck me baby, fuck me." he told me.  "Ooooh yes I will fuck you and have you cum deep into my ass with your big hard cock!" I told him as we fucked and my clit was throbbing just as hard as his cock was when he filled me full of cum again and I shot my juices all over my own fingers.  We laid there not speaking just breathing heavy and then he began to dress putting his pants on and tucking his shirt into it. He looked at me as I sat on the bed regaining my composure. He unhand cuffed me, I stood up looking at him.  "Will you be needing me anymore officer?" I asked feeling drained.  "I know how to find you if I do." he told me. "by the way my friends call me Officerfriendly2002." he smiled and left.  My sex life is great having met him. I never know where we will meet, either at my apartment or on the road, but its never dull.  The end until the next IM...

      Erotica Writings Collection of BDSM by Erotica_Writings ©   The Punisher  Lisa's head hung down as her long brown hair covered her face as the only thing holding up her nude body was the chains that restrained her wrist.  "Did you piss yet?" The Punisher asked her.  "No sir, I have been holding it as you told me to do." She said with a voice that was becoming weak and cracked as tears burnt her eyes.  "How much longer must I hold this piss?" she asked him trying to fight the pressure building on her bladder.  "When I tell you that's when." He told her as he released his throbbing cock from his pants smiling at Lisa and stroking it slowly.  Lisa began to weep louder as the pressure from her urine was becoming so unbearable to her. This sight excited The Punisher even more and he stroked his cock even harder breathing deeply through his nostrils. He loved how Lisa's legs were closed tightly together as her body squirmed to prevent the loss of even a drop of urine.  He roughly grabbed her breast in both of his hands, squeezing and twisting her nipples and with a sudden push to her stomach causing her pain to her bladder. She held it though. Tears streaked her face as the pressure was becoming unbearable to stand. His cock slid up into her pussy and the stimulation of her pussy and the desire to piss was becoming such a strong urge mixed with the fact that she wanted to cum and piss on him at the same time.  "Please Punisher may I release my fluids for you?" She asked as his hands held her ass cheeks tightly.  The Punisher smiled at her as his cock rammed deep into the thick moist juices of her pussy. Now." he told her grabbing the back of her hair and wrapping it tightly with in his fingers.  Her nipples were hard and swollen, she gushed piss mixed with her hot juices over his large throbbing cock as he bit her shoulder while his cock spewed his hot thick white cum deep into her pussy mixing with her own juices and piss. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head, her mouth was opened as sounds of pure erotic pleasures escaped her lips rising from deep in her stomach. His eyes were closed tightly as his body raged from the passions that this small delicate creature gave to his masculine body.  Lisa's orgasm seemed as if it would not stop just as the urine that flowed from her pulsating pussy, her hips moved in a hard circular grind as she was being over come by the feelings of pure release not wanting it to stop, enjoying how her body was feeling right now. The punisher's cock felt so good beating the interior walls of her pussy until her moans turned into loud screams of pure, hot erotic pleasures and he pulled her hair even harder as their breathing was rasp and deep. For a few minutes there was total silence between them only their breathing could be heard between them and then her body went limp when he unchained her from her cuffs.  "You are free to go now Lisa." he told her as he left the room she had been kept in.  Lisa pulled herself together smiling to herself as she planned her next crime to be reunited with The Punisher. ********************************************************************************* Chapter two  *Mistress Natanne training course*  I am Mistress Natanne and you are my slave, remember you are nothing but a slave, I am not going to be your tender lover, no I am going to enjoy torturing you asshole.

      Fever by Erotica_Writings ©   Oh how you give me a burning fever that burns throughout my body from your touch, kisses, the longing that I know that you can deliver to me. When you wrap those loving arms around my waist, I know my fever is going to rise. My body moves with you to a seductive slow bump and grind as your hands are running up and down my waist and back over the black tight dress that is exposing my large breast that you have not taken your eyes off of.  There is smoke floating in the room full of people sitting and drinking as sensual music fills the air. Our eyes are now penetrating each others and I feel your hand slide slowly down onto my rounded full ass, a slight smirk is all the reaction you receive from me.  You roughly pull me tighter to your body digging your fingers into the middle of my back and the pain is exciting to my flesh and my pussy. My hips begin moving more loosely and so seductively as I feel your cock growing against me and my eyes sparkle from the start of this sexual adventure and wondering where it will end. I feel your hand on my right thigh and now the left one. The black fishnets have my flesh tingling, my heart is beating, a fear of being caught darts through my eyes as I look back into the crowd and I feel my dress rising. I am now up in your arms with my legs wrapped so tightly around you.  People are clapping, and you drop me to my feet to continue our dance of seduction with sizzling seductive body movements, you graze my breast with your hand running slowly down my waist sending goose bumps to rise on my flesh and my panties are becoming so damp from the longing of your body. I long for your kisses down my throat, feeling you biting so lovingly sending chills throughout my body and a moistness that seeps from my hot pussy.  My ass and thighs are moving back and forth as you pull and push my body away. I am your lady on this dance floor and you're my prince that I have longed for deep into the night, I seek your arms for a safe harbor and this night I want you to take me where I have never been.  We leave heading for passion that is burning hot and deep within our bodies, we cannot turn back and forgive us for those whom it might hurt. I lay back on the blanket in the cool green grass, we look deep into each others eyes as our lips touch softly, your finger tips trace the out line of my face. Tears burn in my eyes for I have been longing for this moment for so long. I feel your hand under my dress and your fingers find my wet panties, you moan softly looking deep in my eyes placing your fingers between my wet pussy lips and feeling my juices. My breast arches up toward the sky and I feel my panties coming off, I watch you suck my juices from your fingers and sniff the scent of my panties as you release your cock from your pants and now you are on top of my body, caressing my breast, and then you rip my dress off of me. Fear and excitement runs through me, I am now naked under your body as you enter my pussy. Oh baby, baby you feel so good, so hard, your driving me crazy as you dig your finger tips into my thighs and bite my nipples. The sound of my moan makes your look so intense. You are biting my neck and driving me so crazy. Oh please don't take this desire away that you are sending throughout my very being. Your cock rams my pussy hard, and I dig my fingers into your back. Our kisses and actions are turning hot, wild, and exotic and you turn me over on my belly as I take your cock willingly and wantonly into my ass. You tell me "Beg for it"  "Please, please, give me your big hard cock up my tight asshole. I want you to hurt me!"I cry out as your slide your cock into my ass.  Your cock feels as if it is going to rip me open and my fingers find the spot that needs to be massaged, because the pain is driving me crazy with wild hot lust. Our bodies are so into each other, we move as if we are one. Smooth even strokes of your cock meeting my asshole and then it happens. You place me on my back ramming your hard cock deep into my pussy once again claiming me as your whore between the sheets as you spill you're cum deep into my tight wet pussy, as my juices, run over your cock and my cries of pleasure are muffled by your kisses.

Our flesh touch and I feel electric shoot through my body sending me into complete sweet ecstasy and I can feel my heat rising between my thighs.  You whisper *I need you* into my ear that sends a warm sensation through my body and the desire of wanting you, needing you builds so high within my body. You look so tenderly into my eyes as your hand cups my breast and then slowly your moist mouth takes the hard sensitive nipple that you call your cherry and you suck it softly, licking it playfully with your tongue as I feel your hand moving down my trembling body and you enter me with your finger and bringing your finger to your lips your tongue slowly licks my nectar and then you enter your mouth with your finger sucking the juice into your mouth.  Uh, uh, mmmmm  My legs open wider receiving your hard erection deep into my hot juices and our bodies become as one, moving together without being told how, just knowing what the other wants and needs.
