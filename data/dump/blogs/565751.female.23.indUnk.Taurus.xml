      II.   the door stood ajar new air mixed with sweat a fan blew from somewhere 'cus hair tickled my back lightly tapping dots kissing gentle skin my teeth chattered loudly chilled by the air  the sheets clung falling where they shouldn't hiding what I want evidence exposed bare legs sticking moist forehead resting soft white pillow soft white light ahead  he bit my lip my tongue tasted blood sweetness pulsing couldn't help but smile did he have blood  on his sweet lips? did he have blood  on his sweet hands?

      A Small Disection of a Life  I.  Cut One: Waiting the pied piper song of the ice cream truck is ringing and my mother is digging for that one dollar bill buried far down in her purse  check the zipper pockets, dump it out  sitting in that sterile disenfectant room looking at outdated magazines watching the door vanity fair circa 19 something or other with its teased eighties hair sucks clown like faces I found breathtaking giving me a complex back then  any red lights at three a.m.  that throw away statement about sex and maybe Tuesday or Wednesday killed me I wished the phone grew legs and a conscious  plopped aloof in the cradle a silent objector  so I jibber when I should be a person of substance being a pretend writer for a day, sometimes a week life seeps through my tongue and I must regurgitate onto every ear that comes near in the future, i always repeat and repeat, in the future I'll sip my tea naked bearing that soul  motel 66 with its smokey curtains and dirty sheets sleeping alone smothered in the forty bucks I paid, making daddy proud I made it this far daddy, only a week to go maybe sooner if I speed like I always do or plough through the corn states and the mountain states till the golden states dont worry about me, I'm always fine I'm sure there is something good on the included cable  sitting at the lunch table taking each object out carefully in front of me eat the jello including licking the lid then the carrots, the baby kind finally the sandwich cut in half eating the crusts last I clean up and go to my locker to find some book to read in the hallway, or maybe the library  the post office  he stared so intently understanding the swirls and strokes to me it looked like a giant poster of poop but he likes it so I smile and nod use big words and say something about the artist's intent the swirl in the corner sucks me under the painting into a world of upside down skies I'm falling onto purple clouds and picking fights with starts that call me small when I am clearly five feet six and not small at all for a woman and he grabs my hand for the next smile and nod  II.  Cut Two: Changing in seventh grade I changed my name back to Elizabeth  demanded everyone roll out all four syllables  i disowned all nicknames  when I peirced my nose I had nightmares for weeks about nails the size of railroad spikes shoved up my nose bleeding like a river my grandmother telling me about her hairdressor having a nose ring and something in her tongue or maybe in her eyebrow my dad refusing to acknowledge its existance and my mother in her fashion, thought it looked like a giant pimple  I erased that epic message from him  the u-haul truck only held half our stuff then there was garage sales and suddent outbursts of charity my baby bed, Barbie dolls, my little pony club house were the pink pony married the blue one sold for twenty five cents i thought that was a fair price but my mother yelled at me something about gas money but if i couldn't have my stuff at least I wanted a quarter out of it to buy candy  the nurse said that everything went fine and I was ok where the hell was I and what just happened the clock said an hour from the last time I looked at it an hour gone forever and I would have never known if the nurse didnt wake me up can I get up, asses the damange, see how badly my breast damaged after he took it out everyone keeps telling me I'm so young (goddamn it I know how old I am)  my hair used to be blonde  reading my high school journal was the funniest thing ramble after ramble about some nameless boy  seriously sappy with sprinkles of make me barf and I read these to people well just Jackie in the car ride to school  I'll have to thank her one day for saving her eye roll for when I got out of the car  my professor bagged this book I had just bought shoving my book bag further underneath the wooden chair I wrote down what he found agreeable, in his opinion the books that would inspire my shit to at least pretty shit I'm still reading the book, but lightly, with a smirk of intelligencia  III.  Cut Three: Hoping the heads bobbed and hands reached for each other and my mom kept making me laugh in front of everyone i tried but her smile made me fall more than bow she got up taking her peice of music off the stand but i got to stay and enjoy the noise  my best friend is the captain of dodgeball  my mother broke the news that the dog got loose she left the door open and he ran away aw fast as a bullet from the gun he'll be back sniffling the door he has his fun killing ducks and such animal instinct to run in search of a little action once in a while  i threw my bag on his bed gruffly snorting my day into his pillow the soft one his walnut eyes instantly breaking my train of ramble falling into a swirl of purple clouds and insulting stars he calls me tall, for a girl, considering he isn't much past five feet eight  ten miles to home  I get to pick a new outfit for my new school one from the limited, old navy, or maybe the gap with matching hair clips and shoes my next door neightbour's mom is going to drive me to school in her big green Buick with the beige interior  with her spunky cocker spaniel barking goodbye  the secret stash of updated magazines is underneath one of the leather cushions and articel outlines the best colleges for your buck, my college not one of them that nurse is so old i bet she woks here just in case pretty cushy job if you ask me she doesnt have that sympathetic i am so glad you arent my daughter look on her this time she smiles as she hands me the bill  the pied piper song of the ice cream truch is rining and my mother is digging for that one dollar bill  buried far down in her purse check the zipper pockets, dump it out

      OBVIOUSLY  So I'm not spouting my life away like a junior high pink diary Well, not in the way that you see it Up front play - by - play ACTION Instead I edit And personify I'm a doorknob or a corkscrew 'Cus they represent me better Than that phony junior high self The one that sings love songs  And breathes fire on all that look at her cross eyed  Be prepared I am a hateful killer Or a bottle opener Because there is nothing I like better than for you to think me god like Tangible only through words My hair is green and looks great I'm on the cover of Vogue and have an academy award I'm the hopeless writer with nothing else to say Except that she is too clever for the reader But dont beleive that for a second Words lie  The book I'm reading is gnawing at my sensibilities It makes my eyes melt into my sockets and wish it were an ear Always open and closed depending Or the navel ring on that girl in the checkout who works there all the time All shimmery and flashy Resolving to be the end of some guy's dick Soon to be ripped to peices by a simple shimmey of my hips The author knows what I am talking about Did you think it was me talking? Did you think it was all the same?  But then you are just a speck on the Formica table The blue one next to the gray one Near the coffee pot making me coffee for my frozen cappuccino Or maybe you're the dog who likes to lick my face Whenever I enter the room Or better yet the keys to the damn keyboard With the shifter key sticking from so many spills of soda  The cart told me that the truth is out there But its in a place called no where in hell And no one is ever going to find it Not here  Obviously

      JUMP INTO BED  Soft overstuffed comforters are heaven on earth brought down to allow me to be five again racing into bed jumping right in like a diver preparing a triple twril into the clear blue pool  I curl into my cacoon covered deliciously with overstuffed pillows screaming for a pillow fight and pajammas with feet. I can't help but grin my biggest grin and giggle anxiously hoping no one will discover my childish ways.  The queen size feels perfect  to roll around in joy wished never to be tired hold the day for more night time frolicing. My eyes burn with exhaustion but I will not abandon my secluded hideaway.  If only there wasnt this nagging feeling that this joy was meant for two and the empty space, the right one would seem much more fun if you were here throwing the pillows  and tickiling me until I scream "uncle"  My smile winds down to a blithe smirk while I curl up with one of those overstuffed pillows shut my exhausted eyes and dream of me winning our famous pillow fights and collapsing into a pile together

      ODE TO EMILY DICKINSON  My plans today on my day off is to rest in my bed with the covers up and pretend I am an invalid couped up with only my pen and paper linking me with the outside world. I refuse to change out of my sleepware or allow my toes to touch the floor. I am bound to this comfy palace, my eyes are forcably shut.  I must speak with an eglish accent and use words like needles, pinning the air with my random dashes. My skin is delicate and pale seeing no sunlight for months or years  Like Emily my words are to be hidden left like ghosts after I die reminders of a life not wasted but rather shared uniquely. Time had no place for her, and now nor I for I refuse to enter the world today tomorrow or the next. I like it here alone, uncluttered and uniterupted as long as no one knows I am here and no one bothers to remind me.

      My father is a poet too :)  Morning walk  The path of this morning's walk follows the streets, hugging the curbs where leaves are piled. This light is spare, not like summer's fire and flash, but it is enough for this dark time. I wish for such light to chase the shadows of my soul's terrain. Up ahead my brown dog takes the street in great leaps, tongue flying, tail in motion, nosing autumn's debris to find the treasure there. My heart's peace, I think, will not come by straight paths and morning light, but by taking the streets in great leaps, nosing in the shadows for the scent of treasures, the hint of morning.

      SITTING AT WORK  My eyes are having trouble focusing on the job at hand        the object of my affection. My nails, bit down with only flakes of polish left, pink and red. Two coats, one on top of the other. Type these words as they come to me Or I overhear     While sitting at work at the student police station     Listening to a man frantically looking for his lost friend My breathe reaks of alcohol That I drank just a few hours ago    Four smirnoffs and a glass of wine

      AUTUMN  That empty shell sitting on the table; the exoskeleton shell of that bug left on the table counter waiting for the wind to pick it up and throw it god knows where          is me Brown, brittle and crisp like a fallen leaf on the ground snapped underneath my feet as I cross the street. One false move, or a snap of a butterfly's wing, and I, the shell, am crushed to dust brushed off the Formica with a sponge.  That beetle making its exit across the kitchen floor into the crack in the wall leading to freedom filled with greener grass and white picket fencses           is you.  And I let you do it too.  That's a turn we never saw coming, the beetle and the skin; the wanting to be a shell of a thing hallow and delicate begging to be crushed, but the trees all shed their leaves in the fall and the leaf welcomes death  like an accepting mother letting her child into the world. We rake them into piles like it was nothing ignoring the grave suicide of nature.  That row of trees there growing side by side each shedding its summer weight for thinnes of winter shaking every bit of excess           is us. Bare boned, barely breathing,  taking in slow breaths, conserving energy through the cold without mittens and scarves wrapped around our trunks courageously baring the brunt of the world naked.

      My Kinda' Man   urlLink Los Angeles   I travel down your 10 Freeway  rolling the window down,  tracing the telephone wires.  Coasting along your deserted streets  your air spills through my air  and your fingers spread across my back like wings.   My fingers carress your battle scars,  Riot remnants.  You've seen the worst in people,  yet your starlit scars continues  stretching your arms as far as you can.   But your pocker face won't work with me  seeing the beauty of you,  your landscapes glowing  under a California sun.  Cruising along your arteries  I wish to hear your heart beat, my LA.

      The Strawberry  urlLink Strawberry Pop-Tart BlowTorch   The Strawberry   The seam pulses over the rich sweet meocarp  barely holding its seed buttons together. The strawberry  waits to be torn open. Beneath the splattered blanket of night  covered with white droplets, small hands exploring the fields for fruit  stain their small hands scarlet biting into the red jewels.  The same fruit's color slightly fades beneath the market's flourence,  its shape shrinking under each shopper's exploring hands.  But soon the strawberry, becoming just a prop in a love story,  will nourish hungry mouths starving for other lips. The berry's  own skin smeared with whipped cream and dipped in fine wine  is cut into with one bite, slowly dripping onto lips and chin.

      This is a  urlLink triolet  form poem    The Proposal  His hand pushed my hair behind my ear, And I just stood trembling when he came near. His hand pushed my hair behind my ear. The silence, thickened with fear. If only I could, his hand pushed my hair behind my ear, and I just stood

       urlLink *this is an experiment on Surrealism*   Night:About a month ago  The large white moon hangs low in the navy blue thirties movie while Saturn bursts a crater, ash and fire spit from its rings, I fall back into his arms.  Driving in my car I am in the passenger seat and twice in the back watching myself drive the stick shift while he turns the wheel.  I find a book with twisted letters while natural disasters outside cause death the letters fall off the page onto the carpet sentences, paragraphs, chapters all causalities.  the world turns to sand while the stars become beach balls floating over my head. He picks up the book and tries to read but I change my mind and would rather drive myself and myself and myself around.

      The Poetic Journey  I laid my glasses on the table, I did And then I picked them up again because I couldn't read the words A little blind in one eye, like a pirate I couldn't find the words to put on the page, kept erasing, Started with pen and then to pencil and then to plain dictation in my head Leaving the paper behind Walked right out the door into the real world and shut that  poetry out Stuffing keys into holes and pockets Shuffling flip flops against cracks and puddles Imagining myself followed by a man thinking that I might turn around  and see him walking  My destination reached I look back to see nothing but the stanza that I recorded along the way

      The Night Routine  I rub my hands over my forehead, exhausted voices strained (even this is a little strained at the end of the day struggling to come to fruition) There is a pressure on my chest holding me to this - whatever it may become  there was this boy at school with wild hair and dirty fingernails from digging dirt, pile and piles sifting through his fingers rolling over the creases (my head crumbles the music on the radio distracts me singing of love in the same old way)  the polished ending with the dreams and the love flying clouds and circus elephants makes me want to stay up and watch  urlLink Conan  drinking milk waiting until I cant hold my eyes open any longer (like this moment the screen goes dark)  This is the breaking point between awake and sleep my head pounding in millitary fashion on tine pinch at the bridge of my nose and the world goes away (I didn't even notice  my roomate turned off the radio  and switched off the infomercials)

      Version #1 Poem #5    The Races    My vocabulary starch stiff as a board, fluidly flat,      like a   urlLink pancake  without syrup, ran out of words        here.  And then here too.  But then picked up with momentum like a race horse at the very end of a race.      Jockey poking and proding and beating it to death      Ticket holders roaring with their five to ten odds       Move your bloody ass poem, move it for daddy   And then a pause of self reflection.  Withering down my will to keep things together, or on the page,      or even the subject matter,      which I haven't come to yet      but will soon.  Like now -   Another blank -   I have an idea, twirling inside me      like a ballerina in Swan Lake      or a bee inside of a soda bottle licking the sweet sugar      watching the people he could be stinging from inside the glass, but I'm afraid.  I falter, I fail.  I lie awake at night beating the race horse.

       My Poetry   My poetry pours out of my fingers and not my mouth. My mouth just spews  lizards and snakes  crawling out of my tongue and onto the floor.  My poetry twists itself around a pole crashing into trees on its way off a bridge hitting the cold water like a spike on a railway track. It has no form yet, just a crumbled dashboard and broken glass.  My poetry screams off buildings, and into telephones, and best of all while riding the swings, up and down, pushing its feet back and forth to pick up momentum.  My poetry has no words, but rather sounds and grunts passing for a caged animal in the zoo pacing back and forth watching the school groups and tourists throw peanuts and snot and poke their fingers through the cage tempting fate  with full knowledge if it really happened, if they really got their fingers bitten off they would sue the pants off the zoo and get there 15 minutes of fame.

       My Daily Drive   The rush of being in a car jolts met to the bone, grinding me into this euphoric state of being ;where even my smile can't seem to be big enough 	and my laugh just never stops.  I ram my hand into the steering wheel, my chakra of power channeling through my arms and running deep hitting the tips of my toes 	driving faster and faster and faster.  The street lamps fly by and the center dividing line begins to dance jump! jump! jump!  My hand can't help but roll the window down and let the air separate my hair breathing sweet kisses over my face 	while I sing along  	and bear my teeth  	hugging the curves with all my might 	racing towards something inevitable.

      I wanted to include my favorite poem    Nightclub   You are so beautiful and I am a fool  to be in love with you   is a theme that keeps coming up    in songs and poems. There seems to be no room for variation.                                                                                                     I have never heard anyone sing                                                                                                      I am so beautiful                                                                                                      and you are a fool to be in love with me,                                                                                                     even though this notion has surely                                                                                                      crossed the minds of women and men alike.                                                                                                     You are so beautiful, too bad you are a fool                                                                                                      is another one you don't hear.                                                                                                     Or, you are a fool to consider me beautiful.

      Ted Kooser  urlLink   Selecting a Reader  First, I would have her be beautiful, and walking carefully up on my poetry at the loneliest moment of an afternoon, her hair still damp at the neck from washing it. She would be wearing a raincoat, an old one, dirty from not having money enough for the cleaners. She will take out here glasses, and there in the bookstore, she will thumb over my poems, then put the book back up on its shelf. She will say to herself, "For that kind of money, I can get my raincoat cleaned." And she will.

      Cultural Heritage  My grandparents are from Ohio and my great grandfather played the drums his black and white picture hanging in the hallway. He almost looks like a past life of my father. My greatgrandmother has a french maiden name, but she's not from France, from Canada, Montreal I think.  Her parents were farmers and so were my mother's great grandparents in Pennslyvania, in the hills, and then they joined the steel mills and married steel men.  My mother's father doesn't know what he is his father leaving, his mother, not quite right. We joke that he came over from Africa because he has big ears and could have been mistaken for a monkey hiding under a pile of bananas. I half beleived that story when I was little.  My ancestors came from Scotland, says my father, my mom says Germany. My aunt says Sweeden with a touch of French, We wonder about Italian because my mom has olive skin and I heard somewhere Welsh but I don't remember when.

       Queen Sized Bed   I'm having trouble sleeping with a ghost sleeping beside me.  The blankets crease and I awake reaching an arm expecting flesh, but instead my arm falls right through.  His movements are queit yet I awaken more often in this stillness.  I use both pillows  so one of them doesn't get lonely in the middle of the night.

       The Most Unusual Day   I took off my hat today, and instead of putting it on the coat rack, 	like I always do, I ate it.  It was tasty.  I then put on my shoes and walked the dog   inside the house.   But my wife, oh the dear thing, she did the craziest thing.   She kissed me hello.

       My Advice   Cry at the moon if you have to.  Scream bloody hell to the pasty bastard Sitting high and mighty on the splattered blanket Just a reflection of real light Crater filled up close. That stupid man in the land of cheese Needs a talking to Waking me in the middle of the night  And going away so fast in the morning Why not throw rocks Or sticks that you find on the ground? Why not gather all your strength  Filling up your lungs with all your breath To make sure that yellow light bulb Hears what you have to say Because what has it done for you lately? It revolves around you doesn’t it?

       Staring at the Bookcase   The piles of books fell on my face. The letters crushing my heart, killing me slowly, my heart beat fading.  Cascading down from my bookshelf The books fall  onto my chest as my back is straightened for the first time on the hardwood floor.  How delightful to die in such a way, broken by your only crutch. Lifetimes raining down, all not your own, as yours slowly fades to the background.

       Life After Graduation   My new sweater covers the back of my hands. It has holes carefully placed to give it that hippy look. It looks great with my long black skirt that gets caught under my shoes when I walk up stairs.  My hair is a little uneven, little wispys sticking out of the crown  from pulling out those irritating strands 	that fall on my face, but is still looks good after I curled it. I even put on eyeliner, 		black, and mascara to make my eyelashes twice their length.   I left the house for an interview and to drive my brother to the movies but mostly I watched MTV and downloading music. I made a CD and found the black permanent marker in the piles in my room.

       Lazy Bookshelf   If I pile the books just right they look almost bookish like those movies where the set designer said this person is a writer  and we must cover the set with old looking books so go to the closest used book store and buy everything you see it doesn’t matter what it is and I think I have a few classics laying around that we can strategically place so it looks real but then I take one book down to read  and it returns to the lazy pile  tt really is.

       Picture in a Picture Frame   My best friend his picture keeps falling out of the frame so just our heads peak out from above the silver square. We look silly.  No matter how many times I adjust, pull the picture up so its aligned just right it falls back to that spot where our chins touch the floor.

       The Truth seeker   My brother read of my poems today and came up with an entirely different meaning 	than I had intended, but boy was it better that way.  He read each line with an eyebrow raised cautious of what I might have written. It could be political or about love or even worse, about the outdated music that I listen to, but it was simple stuff about a man and his wife.   He understood it, even if his meaning was miles away from what I had intended. But he grasped something I didn’t. What I actually was saying.

       Reading “The Best Cigarette”   urlLink "The Best Cigarette"   I’m reading this poem about Cigarettes  and it makes me want one even though the few that I have had have left me  unimpressed but this author’s smooth words envelope me in a thin smoke, making me want to hold something between my fingers  and gently kiss the tips of thin white lighted rolls. His words speak through the smoke rings and mix together when they meet at the ceiling.  And when that cigarette  Became a train Leaving trails of smoke behind When the poet worked at his typewriter I imagined myself a passenger Waving my hands  to an abandoned lover waving back at me  with tears in his eyes while I smile through mine.

      Sound of Things  I hate when they say  “almost palpable” it is palpable, his words, they press on you  like a wet wash cloth sink into the shape of your leg, or your face.  Soon conversation turns into a land mine just like they say words blow up become ten times their normal size.   If I get lost wandering in my own thoughts I just listen to the sound of you, like warm milk, dripping down my throat.

       Just Day Dreamin   Rushing past my feet  the river,  soft to the touch, gently kisses my feet, each little toe painted red sticking out among the rocks.  My oversized skirt is at my hips held up like the generations before.   I just had to let my hair down letting the wind separate the strands. I just had to let the water wet my legs smoothing over the dryness from the summer heat.  The sky turns like a marble And I can see the stars behind.  I can’t move from my spot slipping into my man made delta. Each drop flows like words on a blank page  drawing conclusions in my whirlwind brain. The sun draws on my shoulder a new freckle.   My hand reached to my eyes to cover my baby blues as the world turns black.

      Carpet Fibers  Give me that criss cross double teaming guy  anyday the one that breaks your heart until it falls onto the floor mixing in with the carpet fibers swept up in the vacuum cleaner.  Give me that crazy jumbled feeling not knowing the truth behind his words his eyes clouded  my breathe heavy and long. We never said goodbye did we?  Give me some time and I might change my mind write my feelings on a note folded up real tiny. Give me somethine temporary like those removable tattos, Or a bag of someone else's life.  I'll take it in to me and release it like a butterfly. It will be so fast.  Don't worry about nothing

       Unexpected   Finding a ten dollar bill in your pocket is unexpected. I reach into an old jacket  I haven’t worn since last winter and there it is, money for lunch and dinner in my pocket.  My belly does a dance  remembering the small number  recorded on my last bank receipt. Here is ten dollars!  It’s like Christmas.  Finding a person in your pocket well, that’s more than unexpected.  I go to a friend’s party, drive a stranger home, and there it is a person falling into my pocket. I study him, like I study a penny, to see if he should remain tucked away next to my hip bone.  I leave him there forgetting I was ever without.  I wear the same pants everyday just so I don’t have to empty my pockets.

       Sunday Ritual   Last week they took out my gall bladder And this Sunday I’m teaching Sunday school Afterwards all the parishioners Will come up to me And kiss me on the cheek With their slippery painted lips And shake my hand  With there wrinkled paws And I wont know any of them Today, Saturday I played video games And read my book Rented a movie  About an adulterous affair And the actress had such a sad face With no expression I sat alone  Wrapped up in the pillows of my sofa And stayed up all night Hoping to receive an email But Sunday  Because my dads the minister Strangers touch my clothes In hopes of redemption

       Isn’t it Romantic?   The swaying violin  sings to that heart that was never known and I’m dancing arm in arm  with a suited man a rose in my hair, a click  in my high heels my white arm draped  on that strong shoulder my head resting, floating along that sea of chords wave of beats brushing legs tangling sweetly  I want to go dancing soft lights with half lit candles tables set with white china one rose set in the center red napkins on a red table cloth love even in the food little kisses on the lips wine left on the pallet a strap falling onto my shoulder soft fingers lifting it back

       coming home   at 22 I raced from my parent’s home to Los Angeles to start my life again with bed frames and bus routes.  one hundred and forty dollars in my pocket a job in the wings making just enough to pay for the things I need.   bed in my suitcase that fills up with air got a living room floor with my name on it..  my worries ahead of me my past behind my brother doesn’t want to say goodbye  i’ve got friends in that town and some favorite places  where I know the menu like the back of my hand  but this new life I’m starting its ready to give birth to sprout its head and wail like a baby.

       The Day Off   My music and the music playing down the hallway Are battling for presence Earlier I fell into bed Listening to their music choice Recognizing a band very few people know about But who I love dearly And then I played some Radiohead And all was quiet in the hall. Maybe that person Fell back onto their bed And listened to the swaying beats But now we both play Female singers with wispy voices They could almost be the same band  But just different albums Its hot outside  And all I have is an open window and a fan And it seems so does the rest of Los Angeles Surviving off ice and cold water Music blasting through their open windows Car exhaust fumes adding the stale brown air Floating ten miles above ground Mixing with the California sun Tanning the last remaining tourists  Flocking to the Santa Monica pier But I am here In this apartment with waxed hardwood floors That make my inflatable bed float upon the ground Listening to the two bands at once An ear for each.

       Problems   You just find that small nick in the bark of this tree and you pick and you pick until the bark falls off the edges giving you a clear view But you need to know the center its secrests underneath so you take an axe and you pry  and you pry til it widens more and more but still, even with  the nick now a gash somethin still remains hidden so you take your giant axe with the sharpened edge and you chop and you chop and you chop wiping the sweat off your brow til all that is left of your tiny nick is a fallen tree and an empty stump with only its rings as permanent memories.

       The America I envision   His black helmet covers his eyes like duct tape while the other lets his har down loose a big red mess THIS IS MY AMERICA with toting flame throwers  make shirt army men appear and disappear in broad daylight  with us, against us its never really clear anymore  Our arms are constantly flexed in case of emergency  I wake up thrown the television  switch off the shows that remind me of what I dont hear throw on some shoes and think only of the garbage bags I must buy at the supermarket and not of the growing number of public disturbances ending in death The black van rolling by with nor marking  goes into my sight but not into my brain so I can purchase my 99 cent hamburgers at Wendys on a daily basis  My life is my home my work my kids my family locking the door at night kissing everyone goodbye whispering hellow in the morning They've closed the supermarket today seems everything is contaminated.

      What is a poem? Is it words, the sound, the flow? Not the flow! It  Could be so  choppy  and yet thats how the poem works   cut  but the poem could flow like glass into water and talk about puppies and daises and I wouldnt give a shit about it  Why do I give a shit anyway?  All my poems start this way, "a false start" where my brain just barfs up words blah and goat and train track with consonants I live consonants to speak a k is like cutting into a great peice a cheese and eating it yum

      So on friday I touched upon a key topic. Yes, I actually had a point (although I thought of it later) on that short introduction. My point being, lying, what is it good for and when do we use it?   Well if you are like me you use it all the god damn time. I use it at work (to get out of stuff or to make me look good), to my parents (no mom I don't need any money and yes I will go to church at some point), and most important in relationships. The relationships I have with friends are mostly built on lies. I pretend to like them and they keep calling. Trust me, it works. But what about my relationship with my boyfriend. Do I lie there? Of course!   Before you start wagging your heads and tisking for shame I'm not talking about the big dramatic lies like I'm really a man or something like that (I am not, I have no penis), I mean the day to day lies. If your man tells you, "Honey I can't talk right now, I'm playing a video game" your response should be, "Thats ok I'll call back later." You lie! I lie! I want him to get of his damn video game and talk to me! But then again if I am at home watching Gilmore Girls and he calls me, well then, I want him off the damn phone. So its give and take. It may be a lie right then and there but thats love and understanding for you.   Actually our relationship is based on truth, entire truth whether it hurts or not. Many fights or discussions have been brought about by our honest look at our relationship and eachother, but instead of fights being starting points for spiral of suckiness they usually are an end to a slight discomfort that mysteriously dissapears once in the light, like bugs.   Is this blog a lie considering he cant see it? No. Cus he has one. I win.

      I really only have about 3 hours of hard work in me, about 4 hours of so - so work, and the rest is just me pretending to do work while I stare in to space. Discuss.

      So I don't know how to fish, but my boyfriend thought this might be a good idea. Sometimes I listen to him, sometimes I don't. Guess I'm a sucker for love 'cus I got one of these started. But he's never to read this, no, for this contains my deepest darkest secret, I AM LAME!

      The mall was a circle, in the middle of delaware, filled with leather shops and silk fabrics. I was out of my league and I knew it, but for some reason my dad wanted to take me here. After a few minutes I found out why. There was mom, with my brother, who I hadn't seen since her surprise get away 2 months ago thats lasted until now.   I was living on my own, so my mothers abscence was no different than her living at home to me. Whenever I called home only one of my parents were ever home at a time so there was hardly a passing of the phone. The only reminder was the delaware area code versus the new jersey, but with cell phones replacing names for numbers I barely noticed.   It seems my dad did. He beleives he was blindsided. One day he came home and her car was gone and a note was left on the counter, gone to delaware, be back soon. Soon became next week, and then she got a job down there, teaching music to 5 yr olds at the brand new school down there.   As we walk through the mall my dad seems over joyous, over happy to be here. His smile is larger than ever seeing my mother, whose smile was not so large. My brother was down there visiting schools (the guise under which my mom left in the first place) and was coming home with us (the guise under which my dad arrived). Before this fateful trip my dad convinced me I wanted to see my mother and that I should go, although I felt more like he wanted someone by his side when he met the eyes of a woman who left him with an entire house to fill by himself.   I agreed for 3 reasons. 1, I felt for my dad and 2, my boyfriend was coming with me, 3rd I wanted to buy shoes. My mother tore me away to stalk the aisles of every expensive store for just that reason, to only find shoes way over budget and in every style that I didn't want. The last pair of shoes were at the bargain price of 75 dollars. Not worth it.   And then I woke up.

      Friends are like stapler removers, only work with a lot of effort. Happens to be I hate stapler removers, too much effort. So yeah, friends be gone. I should sell that somehow. I think I would make a wonderful infomercial host.   When a friends betrays your trust your gut spills over. Its fun. Funner, and yes I use that word, funner is totally making him own up to it. Way back when in the time that land forgot I would have somehow beleived it my fault. And now I know.

      Loggin onto friendster always makes me laugh out loud. First of all, I don't even call my friends, let alone pay attention to what they post or write on a little website of tiny pictures, nor do care how many friends I have, unlike friendster that notifies you when you have added another tiny picture to your collection.   The reason it makes me laugh out loud is the sudden rush I get when I find someone from my past and I am just way cooler than they are, by far. I wish I knew I was this awesome before, I could have done something about it. Being awesome, is well, awesome, prooving it by finding the most retarded picture of a high school buddy is priceless. I guess people never change. Thank god Adam created a computer generated picture of myself with huge boobs and a tan. Make me look awesome. Again, I am all that is awesome.   If I could post that picture here I would. Too bad my computer skills are not awesome. Good thing coolness isnt based on that. Good thing.

      So I noticed that in a lot of blogs, and in my life, things repeat. I'm tired. I hate my job. Blah blah blah.   So   In todays top story Liz has received a suede love seat that she is proudly taking home for free that will fit nicely in her studio apartment. In other breaking news Norkin, Liz's old college friend, the Liz with the new couch, will be coming over to sit on said couch and watch Last Comic Standing. Norkin, a source of Liz's perpetual singleness for most of college due to her blinders and carrot fed by Norkin, has never seen the show and will be chilling while boyfriend works late and deprives her of boy time.   As a side note, Liz with new suede soft couch which was given to her by her boss who is getting rid of things from his divorce, woke up to see her stuffed monkey astronaut asleep next to her head and it gave her a start. Not one to sleep with bears and dolls since those damn chucky movies Liz awoke to find that yes her head was still attatched to her body and no the monkey was not out to get her, all thanks to her Boyfriend who thought it would be cute.  Yeah, this format is lame. I lose.

      Adam has found out his time slot for his new job. 6pm - 3am M-F. I will never see him during the week. Ever. Wont even be able to talk to him.   Lately I've felt like digging a hole and never coming out of it, and possibly dragging him in with me to cuddle. Is this normal not to like anyone on the planet but him? Maybe degrassi will show some insight for friday night    is         DEGRASSI BREAKFAST CLUB

      I'm back from my too short vacation. Vegas = fun if you get drunk and go with your boyfriend. All right. Although never convinced him to get married. When I sobered up I realized he was right, getting married on a pirate ship would be awesome.   Went to Aspen, Co only to turn back round again to go back to work. Bummer.   I saw a political cartoon that states: Hummer Bummer. I think thats what my boyfriend felt like when I passed out in the middle of one. Oops. Still holding on too.   Got home, cleaned, turned my apartment upside down. Now I shall buy a swiffer.   P.S. WORK SUCKS

      I can never finish a can of coke. I bring one with me to lunch every day and end up pouring half of it out becuase in my lack of attention it would turn flat and hot. Adam drinks at least 4 a day, and I'm not sure how he does it. He is a master of climate control I beleive, like Storm.   I have this overwhelming feeling that I have forgotten something or someone. Hrm. Well if I knew what it was I wouldn't be worried about it.   Everyone should carry with them breath mints to give me at all times. I like them, but I never remember to buy them.
