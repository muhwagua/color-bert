      a student in my class tonight commented on food additives as a reason for the early development of girls in america. she claimed that her pediatrician had told her that her own daughter (age 10) probably developed early because of all the processed food she ate.  I really cannot believe that preservatibves would have anything to do with early estrogen production, but i didn't tell her so.  i have not yet mentioned the eku class that i teach 2 semesters a year- nutrition 201, required for nursing students. the best students are the mature ones- in their late 20's to late 50's, who have already worked awhile- married, had children, and have gone back to school to do something they want to do.  they study harder, make better grades,and contribute much more colorfully to class discussion.  college, it could be saie, it wasted on those who have just finished high school.  the young ones tend to sit in the back and chat amongst themselves rather than pay attention.....i wished that i had paid more attention to selected college classes- like art history. i had been to many art museums at the time, but lacked the curiosity to study paintings closely for composition, focal point, etc. when i was actually in front of famous paintings.  in brussels i particularly enjoyed rachel's discussion on alterpieces, the reason for the two sides, the meaning of the fantastic creatures amongst the religious elements. etc.   how enviable to grow up with an artist.....

      ok, so i am going to have to invest in all of ani's cd's, as i like the edge on her lyrics.  cayle may be too young for them, however.  speaking of too young, a friend commented yesterday about cayle's development- about she seems young to start developing and that we had better keep a careful eye. this friend went on to share with us that her daughter developed early and was date raped at age 15 while out with a 23 year old that that they had to prosecute.  ernst about had a stroke thinking about the future ahead with our daughter. my first thought was about the wisdom of letting a 15 year old out with anybody let alone a 23 year old.  i wasn't allowed to car date until i could drive on my own 'just in case'- which seems reasonable to me now though it didn't seem so then.  of course, i tell cayle that she won't be able to date until she has graduated from college and has a job.......

The Official Driving Song.. if you don't know it download it. it is our driving song... right em   Imperfectly- Ani DiFranco   i'm okay if you get me at a good angle and you're okay in the sort of light and we don't look like pages from a magazine but that's all right that's all right   i crashed your pickup truck and then i had to drive it back home i was crying i was so scared of what you would do of what you would say but you just started laughing so i started laughing along saying, it looks a little rough but it runs okay it looks a little rough but it runs good anyway   we get a little further from perfection each year on the road i guess that's what they call character i guess that's just the way it goes better to be dusty than polished like some store window mannequin why don't you touch me where i'm rusty let me stain your hands   when you're pretty as a picture they pound down your door but i've been offered love in two dimensions before and i know that it's not all it's made out to be let's show them how it's done let's do it all imperfectly     posted by Mo The Phoenix at 10:20:22 PM

      i see that my blog name pales in comparison to others, such as sticky hands, sticky arms....i might just have to start reading that one.  yesterday i made a 27 mile pilgrimage to the wine and beer store in lawrenceburg. they had a sign above the counter that read...a $10 surcharge will be added to your bill if you are irritating, annoying or just plain mean.  frankly, i don't see  myself as mean enough to warrant an extra $10... maybe $5 on a really bad day....  i am still upset about my church, and whether i see myself going there through stephan's high school years let alone cayle's. the possibility of switching churches comes to mind.  many of stephan's friends are catholic- i cannot be a catholic because i am firmly opposed to the catholic church's stance on many issues-marriage of priests, women as priests, birth control, etc. i could not join that church in good faith, and they would certainly not want me.  if stephan wanted to go to their youth group on his own, that would be his decision.  ernst and i attended the episcopal church a few times- they are more liberal than the catholics, with many of the same liturgical features, and with progressive notions about woman as priests. i could see myself as an episcopal, i suppose.  the main drawback to switching churches is manyfold- i have frequently held in contempt those who switched from our church when they didn't like rev. noel. i really do like my sunday school class- i have attended this class for 15 years- and enjoy many of the members. it could be considered one of the social highlights of my week. lastly, i do not want to have to explain my switch because of the hard feelings that may arise. i could easily move myself over to the methodist church and sit with my mother in the pew. that way i would not have to discuss the youth issue at all- i can just say that it was done for family unity. of course, stephan and cayle may not like their youth group, either.  non-attendence of church is not an option. i feel that my children need the church backround, to draw upon for strength and rejuvination in tough times. when they are on their own they can make their own church choices, but while they are with me they will at least go to church with me and sit as a family. if this is a sign of a mean mamma........

      mean mamma is in theologocial turmoil, and she has got it bad. its all about church and the oldest's graduation, and i can't see a good solution.  the oldest refuses to be included in our church's annual senior recognition sunday.  this goes beyond shyness- rather to a feeling of alienation on his part to the church.  i didn't quite understand the extent of this alientation until youth sunday yesterday- when the youth group did the service. stephan, the second son, calls our church's youth group the boyle county social club, as 100% are from the county and what few danville city school students who actually go to our church have given up on it. during one of the prayers, a junior at bchs actually prayed thanks to the best church and the best school SYSTEM in the best town in america. not plural, singular. that could have been a slip, but the sentiment has always been plain that the county kids are friends and the non-county kids are not part of the group. Andrew quit going to sunday school years ago, and i suspect that stephan will do the same soon. i do not blame andrew for not wanting to be associated with this crowd, at least not as much, after the service. for starts, they did an 'interpretive' song- which bordered on ridiculous- with hands motions similar to american deaf language but corny beyond words. it was a bit over the top in relation to my confort level on public displays of religious fervor.  the personal testimonies really got to me- one senior girl from bchs described a writing portfolia piece in which she recollected a christian rock concert she had attended at which she had an epiphany about not prejudging other people based on appearance. then she preceded to admit that she had fabricated most of the story, but contended that she still did not judge others by appearance- that may be so, but i do suspect that my son's decreasing interest in attending our church has something to do with the prejudging and exclusion of those who do not attend bchs.    on the other hand, andrew has attended this church since he was three years old, he was baptised there, and is a member.   i am saddened that he feels no connection to people who have watched him grown up before their eyes. senior recognition cermeonies, like graduation ceremonies are not just for the people being honored. they are for the parents, and others who have supported and nurtured these youths for all these years.  to simply refuse to show up because you are shy or because you don't feel connected isn't a good enough reason to not show up.  life is a two way relationship between you and those around you.  there are things you do to be part of a community. to not show up slaps us all in the face.

      the newest dilemna for my mean mamma rule of blog ettiquette revolves around the inside knowledge one gleans from reading blogs.  does one pretend that one does not actually know that a new mean mamma has emerged and that her daughter is terribly distressed about not being able to have her boyfriend over while her parents go out on a well-earned date?  being that i am eternally mean, i blabbed this the moment i saw said mean mamma, and asked her if she has made up a little dance to go along with her newfound meanness.  i neglected to add to the conversation that i tell my 9 year-old daughter that she may not go out with boys, or have them over until she has finished college and has a job.  so far she believes me......so far neither of  my boys have asked to have dates over while i am gone. .....  speaking of high school boys, i had a mother of a junior boy get in my face at cayle's under-10 soccer game saturday about the behavior of high school boys. she got rigfht in my face, in a driving rain, no less, and asked me if i was aware that my oldest high school boy goes to 'those parties they have' and that he drank beer.  and if i knew it did i condone it and what was i going to do about it if i didn't approve.  when i got over the shock of this woman's ranting, i pointed out that it would be naive of me to believe that my child will never drink alcohol, let alone beer- and that my concern was that he not drink too much beer and not drive whilst doing do or after doing so. i added, just for kicks, that i also prefer that he drink decent beer, not that cheap wimpy stuff they sell in 24 packs like pepsi.  well, i didn't say cheap wimpy stuff, but i did make a comment about drinking decent beer.  i also said that i would rather him drink beer than whiskey or vodka, and that so far he had shown reasonable judgement in his partying.  then i pointed out that her son must also be at these parties to know so much about my child......  this part of mean mamma parenthood is difficult.  as a died in the wool liberal, it is a tough call about underage drinking, which can get people hurt or jailed, or worse.  on the other hand, i truly enjoyed drinking a beer or two with my underage children in brussels, strasbourg, lambsheim and haarlem.  my cousin edwin in lambsheim was thrilled that my children enyoyed the beers he bought for them and that both seemed to hold it well. ben franklin said it well, everything in moderation.  good advice for drinkers of any age.

      ok, so there are more concerts that i wish that i had seen, or at least parts of concerts. i wish had seen led zep singing stairway to heaven, kashmir, the battleofnevermore, and misty mountain hop.  i wish i had seen elton john sing the candle in the wind tribute to princess diana- that would have actually put me at her funeral, you see....i would like to see eric clapton singing bell bottom blues, the beatles singing anything they wanted, but especially hey jude (the long version) and come together.  i can clearly remember the first time i ever heard that song- in susan bishop's basement- it was the flip side of something- i think- on the 45 single version. i like the part about carrying pictures of chairman mao...even after 30 or more years.  wait, that's revolution.. oh well when you are as old and mean as me, details get muddled along the way............

      i envy petra's bob dylan's concert tickets. ernst and i had friends read the lyrics to forever young at our wedding. i regret that i never saw bd in concert.  so what concerts have i gotten to go to?  bruce springstein, bbking, joe walsh, the eagles, dan fogleburg (3 times), the beach boys, steely dan ( on their only concert tour), crosby, stills, and nash, todd rungren, yoyo ma, pure prairie league, leon redbone, jonathon edwards, jethro tull, .... there are more, but i can't recall them now. jethro tull and crosby, stills, and nash were outstanding. i regret that i never saw them with neil young. my favorite song is cowgirl in the sand- the 4 way street version, of course.

      i am so impressed by rachel's web site, and all of her graphics, pull-down menus, links, and other accroutrements(sp) i just thought i would divulge this sentiment.  i like the word divulge, by the way. a commentator on npr was doing a rebuttal to recent reviews of alainis morrisette's new album, in which mags like rolling stone etc have lambasted a.m. for using thesaurus words like divulge.  i appreciate writers who use vivid terms- it is like having stephan's word of the day on a larger scale.  i wonder if alainis has ever written a poem about the month of april......the web audience at large, or at least just me waits impatiently for the 'poems about months' poet to divulge his april poem........

      ok- now i am really ticked off. i went back to knitting lady's site, hoping to find an afghan pattern- this crazy woman only has photos of all of her knitting projects- at least 100 of them- but not one actual pattern.  what is up with that?  i guess she is proud of each and every pair of socks that she has made, but not inclined to share the actual pattern for said socks.    somehow, this afghan pattern setback makes me thaink more of going to the dorgogne this winter- i bet that i could find an afghan pattern there- happily patterns for knitting are universal with regards to k,p,yo, etc. it might even help my french to use a french-based pattern.  of course, explaining my need for a trip to my spouse on the basis of the need for an afghan pattern may be on the flimsy side.......but then, i AM the mean mamma....

      i am enjoying this 'one new blog a day' thing. i just went to wendy's knitting blog- at wendyjohnson.net.  yesterday she photographed and posted all of her sock yarn, and sometime last week she knitted 1 inch of a complicated sweater. i should go back and see if she has a decent aghan pattern- i have some of my motherinlaw's yarn in a box in the back of my car......maybe i could just knit instead of blog.    i am delighted to discover who my oldest son has asked to the prom. i think she is a marvelous choice- very extraordinary with regards to brains, personality, and joie-de-vivre.  now i must extract a promise that i will get to see them all dressed up before the dance- as he will not be coming to his own prom dinner party here at the restaurant....the best laid plans, as they say.......i wonder if she can knit?

      the new gourmet came today.....i spent the last 45 minutes perusing the recipes that i won't make anytime soon. and ogling the locales that i won't visit anytime soon, and windered why i take this magazine.  because i am mean is the obvious answer, but not the truth. i take this magazine IN CASE i get a batch of lemon grass in my clutches, and IN CASE i find myself on the amalfi coast. somehow, my whims( a rental car loop between barcelona,carcassonne, bordeaux, bilbao, and barcelona) have not made the big time with an article all their own.    i enjoyed reading petra's blog about praha today. i had considered going to praha on my last excursion,. but deemed it too far. i would have like stephan to have seen the fred and ginger house. i would have liked to have heard mozart in a church setting. one of these days i will make it there myself.  i had someone comment recently that ernst must be a particularly tolerant spouse, because i travel so much without him.  for thew record, i have traveled extensively with my spouse- to 38 states, and 8 foreign countries- some with our children and some with just ourselves.  when i am done traveling wit places that andrew, stephan and cayle would like, i will go with ernst to placs that he will like- the appalachian trail, the trans america bike trail, australia/nz, windjammmer cruises.... big bend.... these days somebody has to stay with cayle, and ernst hasn't seemed to hot on midwinter trips to northern europe.  the last passage has made me nostalgic for my father, who traveled to all the states and 14 foreign countries. i miss him listing them all now that he is completely senile.  every ounce of my being that aches for the open road comes from herbert crown- the man born to travel.  one of the few things that regret from the life on this earth is that my children do not fully remember my dad as himself.  or recall my dad showing slides of his trips. or witnessing my dad planning his next trip.  i grew up with a next trip always at hand.  the stack of slides that is now in the backroom cabinet is of alaska- i took them out to use the carrosel for my own roots tour to europe.  i really need to look at these slides myself- set up dad's projector and enjoy them for what they are- but i am just not ready for that yet, as a daughter...of a father in the twilight.

      ok- so i am the mean mamma. yesterday i put in aload of stephan's clothes, and neglected to check eah pair of pants for contraband.  one gap pair had 2 pens in a pocket- which tainted the entire load. using an entire can of hairspray i was able to get out all of the pen smudges except for the mother lode pen pocket- that pair will have to go to the dry cleaners.  ironically, the hairspray came in the mail as a free sample, and was unopened at the time of the inkstain tragedy, as i am far too mean to use hairspray.......

      i waited 55 minutes at stonegate gardens yesterday for the frontloade to get fixed so i could get the load of mulch that i paid for. if i knew the frontloader was broken i would not have bought mulch.......the load only got to the middle bed, and only part of that. it will surely take another 2-3 loads to finish up. this load really smelled like a hog farm....scrary.....andrew asked at supper what mulch is made from. stephan replied 'old growth forests'.   he said that the most expensive mulch would be made from boards pulled out of historic homes, like mt vernon.  i would prefer to mulch with ground up $100 bills.....  my first rose is blooming- stanwell perpetual has one tiny blossom- noticed on 4/20/02.  that may be a record for us.

      this afternoon we are hosting a bridal shower for 26 people- it is hard to serve a group of women who insist on spending more time out front smoking cigarettes than they do eating our food or opening presents.  the bride is probably one of the smokers......several have commented about our rule for smoking outside rather than inside.  somehow, a bridal shower in a smoke filled room seems declasse even for this part of the country. at least the favors at each placesetting weren't packs of marboral lights.......

      on public radio the other night as i drove home from work, there was a group of buddhist monks doing gutteral chants that sounded especially primal and/or repulsive. the comentator wanted to review how these chants play into the buddhist religion. the lead monk highlighted the tenets of their faith- purity of thought, search for truth, achievement of righteous emptiness. i am still worried over the emptiness part- i spend my days trying to acheive fullness- i see nothing righteous about emptiness. in fact, i see nothing productive about the monks life- they don't help anybody and their self-reflection could be considered self indulgent as opposed to serving mankind. clearly, i am not cut out of the same cloth as the buddhists.

      ok, so i was wrong about byron white- though he was nominated by jfk, he voted against roe v wade and against other pro-choice questions that came before the court.  with the senate in control of the senate, w will have a hard time getting through a candidate that is too right wing.....at least i hope that is the case.....  on the way to work, npr ran a story about the manhattan bulb project. on 9/12, the director of parks in manhattan received a call from a bulb grower inholland, asking how he could help- this grower personally sent 500,000 daffodil bulbs, and the city of rotterdam sent another 500.000 bulbs.  volunteers planted them in as many bleak sections of the city ass they could manage- this week they are in bloom- a city reborn.......of course, i teared up as the story ran, because it struck me as such a sweet gesture on the part of the dutch, a population that shares some of my roots.  i find it ironic that sentimental news clips can bring me to tears, while trench-warfare with andrew at home, with him screaming in my face - doesn't evoke that emotional response.  maybe he justs wants to see me cry, and maybe thats why i just won't.    i have done some checking about my dream getaway to spain. the plane tickets are $700+ at this point, the train doesn't go straight from barcelona to bilbao- goes through madird for a major time consuming stour, and plane tickets from barcleona to bilbao rt are $271- there is going to have to be a major price-war special fares thing going before this trip will happen any time soon.....

      on my way to work there is a house for sale- with 5 bedrooms. this house is a box dug into a hill with a basement- the notion that there are 5 bedrooms has prompted several discussions with stephan before he gets out at the hs- are there 3 br up and 2 down- is there a bed in the laundry room- is the upstairs nothing more than 3 br and a kitchen? ah well, i am not interested enough to call the realtor and see for myself.  i envy poets, and people who think with their words in such a pleasing order- i spent yesterday trying to compose a poem in my head- but couldn't even find a first line.  i like this poem by edna st. vincent millay-  my candle burns at both ends, it cannot last the night but ah, my friends and oh, my foes it makes a lovely light  i can certainly understand the sentiment of burning the candle at both ends. my new profession is a lot of intensive work followed by inexplicable lulls. ironically, on the busiest days, i don't have time to eat, and often remember that i have not eaten when i am already at hom,e and have neglected to bring something tasty with me.

      i have got this notion that i want to fly to paris on 1/1/03 then take the tgv to  biarritz on 1/3/03 and then on to bilbao. bilbao and the guggenheim have gotten into my mind and i can't get them out. i want to ride the subway where the entrance looks like big steel worms. i want to eat tapas and drink a nice red from riojas.  of course, i know no spanish beyond gracias and mucho gracias. maybe i will pick up spanish faster than i picked up german........maybe stephan and i could make an excursion of it with rachel and petra- we had a good time on the last trip. andrew may want to come, but will probably want to work and earn some money.....if i got the kids back to school by 1/6/03 or 1/7/03, maybe the school wouldn't be too upset.

      ok, so i can't spell byron correctly. we two-finger typists, who lack the dexteritity to use all fingers to tap keys at will, have to do the best we can with what we have got.....andrew appears to have tremondous typing skills- he appears to be able to type faster than he can write.  i took a summer typing course in high school, assuming that i would need to know how to type papers when i got to college. i seem to recall using a borrowed portable typewriter in my dorm room- maybe i still have it somewhere. typing on a real keyboard is a greater challenge than a computer steup- it takes more pressure to depress the keys.  my biggest mistakes were in the switching of letters- like bryon versus byron- i used up a lot of white out in the days before spell check.    i watched 24 with ernst last night. i have not seen all of the episodes, and feel a bit lost at some points when i can't quite follow the many plot lines. there are 4 'hours' to go and lots of explaining to do in this far-fetched tale. happily i walked 20 minutes on the treadmill so the time wasn't a total bust.  i find as i get older that television is not my primary choice for entertainment- i would rather sit in a hot tub, drink a cold beer, and read a book. the conservative right in boyle county would prefer that i drive 28 miles to get that beer, as the purchase locally would corrupt our youth, cause litter on our streets, and mayhem with the inevitable drivers under the influence. youth have been corrupted for centuries- socrates was convicted of corrupting youth in a time when beer and wine were the only beverages available. how silly the moralists are when it comes to 'protecting' society.....even christ drink a glass or two of wine with his friends, but the right wingers would have us to believe that it was really grape juice in his glass.....  enough of these rantings- i have got to get to work, cook some food, and get on with the day.

      i am distressed by the death yesterday of bryon white, one of the supremes- appointed by JFK himself. he was one of the more liberal justices- and will surely be replaced by one of the more conservative people that W can pull out of his bag of people to whom he owes political favors. maybe ken lay? he's not doing anything these days. maybe ashcroft will volunteer for a lateral move from attorney general to supreme court. regardless of who is the replacement, the possibilities for right-wing agenda to prevail in the court is especially frightening.  roe v wade may be 30 or so years old, but here are those who would take us back to the days of home-done abortions, or backstreet hack jobs. the book i am reading, living with cats, is an autobiographical piece about and by marge piercy, a poet, novelist and activit. she chronicaled her own home-done abortion in the 60's, from which she nearly bled to death. my husband's grandmother(melva may morning ernst) died of complications of an illegfal abortion, in a age when unmarried catholic women just didn't have babies. my mother-in-law once told me this tale, then later retracted it, but i believe that it is true. who would make up this kind of stuff about your own mother if it didn't have truth to it?  i believe that life begins somewhere between conception and birth- when the fetus could live on its own if born at that moment. abortions are commonly done when the fetus is about the size of a thumbnail, and therefore i do not believe that we are dealing with life- only potential for life. i lost a baby to ectopic pregnancy somewhere before 12 weeks- there was nothing to bury and nothing to name- just lost potential that we mourned at the time and continue to mourn in our own ways. before 12 weeks, i believe that women have the right to choose whether to continue with this potential for life or to end it.

      stephan asked at supper if mean and hateful necessarily go together. can one be a mean mamma and not be hateful? is being hateful part and parcel of being a mean mamma?  andrew appears to beleive that ebing annoying is part of being mean.... i drove into town to try to jump his car 'in front of the library' after he finished up work. he was not 'in fornt of the library', but in the baptist lot and i almost missed him as i drove by. i made the mistake of mentioning this logistical error, as well as not knowing how to jump a car- he went into a screaming tirade on the specific degree to which my presence in his life was useless and irritating.  a mean mamma would have ejected him on the road and let him find his own ride home.  i make no claims to understand car repair or emergency service- he knew so before i came into town. if anything, he should have paid more attention when his dad has jumped his sorry car in the past........

      i missed my mother-in-law today, in an unexpected way. the phone rang about 4:45pm while i was still enjoying a rare sunday afternoon nap. my first thought was...it's kay, because kay always had a knack for calling when i was asleep and there was no one but me to answer the phone. 'oh, were you sleeping dear? ' she would ask  before she launched into pleasant conversation about all we were doing. finally she would ask to talk to ernst- who was probably out hiking with stephan and cayle- which was why i got to nap in the first place.  her death on 3/30 was no surprise, given the swelling in her feet we noticed over president's day weekend and her severe smothering cough.  she really didn't look good in february, but appeared to hold on long enough to call or visit several friends and many family members before letting go of this life. i shall miss her.

      i am so tired, and i don't want to go to work today.i do not think that the human body was designed to work 6 days a week, despite the biblical thing about God only resting on the 7th day.....i dreamed about food last night. something about people going to PigglyWiggly for butter that was 29 cents a pound and freezedried sliced apple and pear slices on sticks for use by space travelers.  the sticks were too long and i had to snap off the ends in order to eat the pear. i find food dreams interesting rather than an annoying extension of my dailywork.  the dreams that are annoying are the typing dreams- where each word is typed/spelled out slowly as in typing onto a computor screen. i have had these dreams after intense bouts of typing, and find that this continuation of work from wakefulness to sleep time to be disturbing.

      typed mean mamma into google.com- and came up with this classic from an unidentified source- i am not near this mean......  May 17, 2001  Mean Mamma    I'm a mean, mean mother.   Just ask Mikey the majority of the time, Nathan all of the time and Erica when she gets her little wee mouth tapped for blowing raspberries at me when she's ticked off or for telling me 'no'.    I spank. I ground. I take away televisions, telephone time, outside time and by god, I stick to it. STUART is a big wash when it comes to consistency but it's my middle name.    I am most certainly not what people would consider politically correct either when it comes to discipline.    Things I've told my children:   I don't care WHAT you think in your head but by God, I'd better not hear it come out of your mouth because you'll be picking your teeth up off the floor.    You don't get paid to think. There's a reason for it.    I'm going to knock you out if you do that one more time. Think I'm kidding? Go ahead and test me.    Slam that door one more time and I'm going to stick you in the door and slam it shut. It's my house, quit messing with it.    How would you like to eat a bar of soap? Mouth almighty.    Go ahead. Keep running that mouth and see what happens.    I'm sorry. Just shut up and do it because it isn't up for discussion. That's the way it is.    If you don't quit acting like a baby, I'm going to put a diaper on you and treat you like one. Quit the whining.

      elizabeth barret browning wrote, at the age of 9-  'come forth my muse, and tune the lyre so bright.  the darkest soul illume with purer light,  and pour instruction o'er the embarrased mind,  and Godly virtue in the wicked find......  i like her turn of words- about finding virute in the wicked, like finding goodness in the mean mamma if the light shines upon her just right.....of course, e.b.b. had a mean daddy, not a mean mamma. how sad that they never spoke after she eloped with mr browning, and that her letter to him explaining her desire to marry went unopened. much as i can't imagine andrew growing up and moving away, i can't imagine faulting him for wanted to do so.

      i am wishing that i had some pinot grigio(sp?) in the refrigerator to greet me when i get back from work tonight. i have never seen pinot grigio grapes, so i am unsure if they are, in fact, grey. the idea of grey grapes is not appealing, though the wine is quite fresh and crisp and just right for a nearly spring day.   i am still on the lookout for alsatian style wine glasses, with the tall green stem and clear bowl. reisling without these glasses falls short of perfection.....

      the screen actress tallulah bankhead once said- 'only nice girls keep a diary, bad girls just don't have the time'.  maybe keeping an online journal will push me back to the nice side of motherhood and away from the meanmamma stuff. maybe i shall just start going by the name tallulah, it has a mean and oh-so-evil sound to it, kind of like ursula in the little mermaid. i haver a short list of names that i would use should i ever write a novel. i am drawn to freeway exits. on the way to ann arbor michigan there is an exit called lucky/haskins. lucky haskins sounds like a good guy in a western flick, doesn't it.  there is also an exit ont he way to louisville that i like- but i can't recall it just now.  maybe there is a connection between memory and overall meanness.....

      I was reallymean this morning to my daughter, who left the house wearing shorts that are clearly too short and too small, and bright yellow socks. She said she was cold and i told her that if she felt warm enough to wear shorts she didn't need a coat.  this child resists directives on appropriate dress- on matching, on clothing choice, etc. i fear that she will be a glamour don't when these things begin to count- say in middle school. of course, it will all be my fault when push comes to shove....  i am reading a memoir by marge piercy, a poet and novelist- called Sleeping with Cats. it is fascinating-not just about her life as a feminist jew now on her third husband who is 16 years younger, but also how her poetry and cats play into the narrative. my husband tolerates cats- but he could never fall asleep if one were even close to the bed. men who actually sleep with women who sleep with cats are a rare breed. i wonder if it is a genetic thing.....stephan seems just fine sleeping with our precious cat-sometimes.....

      the bathroom at work has an old copy of Rolling Stone behind the seat- a pre-9/11 copy, pre-enron copy, pre-lady marmelade copy.  there is a eulogy to joey ramone of the ramones- i can't recall a single song by the ramones and don't think i ever heard an album. i know now that he was cutting edge in 1974 when punk came along and that many groups borrowed from his verve and his vibes. if napster was still alive i would download something.

      I divulged the existence of my blog to both of my sons last night. the middle child guessed the name mean mamma right away- and challenged me to come up with an ungrateful child chant and dance. my older child thinks that blogging is stupid-why would you want to journal on-line? it should be done in private. frankly, this is private in the sense that i am not saying anything that i would mind others reading. my private thoughts stay in my head.   after poo-pooing my blog, my older child told me that he was watching a movie and that i was taking up his precious time. he had borrowed the original sabrina from the library. he knows that i really like the harrison ford version- but closed the dorr instead. child-raising sucks- you bring up your children to embrace a wide variety of media, ideas, locales- and when they finally get old enough to seek these things out for themselves they don't want to share the experience with you. i hope he remembers to take back the movie before e fine kicks in.....

      ok, so i looked all day for an excuse to use the term 'in high dudgeon', it is so jane austenesque. frankly, i have been in high dudgeon all day- for no particular reason other than i would rather be at home, with a good book, and a glass of wine, out on my deck, getting just a bit of sun. the sun thing is less important now that i have discovered that estee lauder sells perfectly respectable sun in a squeeze bottle.  i do not have a new good book just now-but i am rereading some old good books that a friend returned to me recently( i apologize to those in my family who were falsely accused of having said books....) i have reread the pleasing hour, by lily king, le marriage and le divorce , 2 books by diane johnson, and will reread the hours (?author) next.  the hours is being filmed with tom cruise's ex wife whose name escapes me as the star.  it is based on virginia wolfe's life and either the wave or to the lighthouse or both- but is in no way autobiographical-i read the book based on a review heard on npr (ditto for the pleasing hour) i have only made a few mistakes with reading books reviewed on npr, by the way.  adults should be issued summer reading lists just to keep them up to snuff on what is out there worth reading.......no tests, please.

      ok, so mean mamma regrets using the term 'pissed off' in yesterday's blog. she should have used a more interesting synonym like displeased, animosed, angered, enraged, indignant; exasperated, piqued, took umbrage of, huffed, miffed, in high dudgeon over, etc. yea, yea, yea, so I looked those up on thesaurus on-line, but it has been quite some time since mean mamma memorized the thesaurus.....speaking of which, it is not too soon for certain scholars she knows who wish to attend competitive colleges to start memorizing the thesaurus in preparation for the sat and act.  it would be deliciously ironic if one of my synonyms made cut in either of those tests- i give you permision in advance to chuckle aloud if one should be printed saucily on the page....  ernst and i really did enjoy the baseball game last evening in lexington. the park is small and each seat has a great view of the action, close enough to hear the crack of the bat and the muffled whoosh of the ball in the cather's mitt. we had sub sandwiches and ky ale, a quite nice beer with a nutty flavor that was surprisingly smooth- i have been bit before by local beers that were like sleeping dogs (a bit of a bite....)  the legends won 5-2, and we got home before 11:00 pm. i could have done without the dancing girls, the loud musical interjections (hit me with your best shot.....) and the constant commercials just below the big screen for replays. but this is america, and this is the stuff we do best.....

      ok, so i am pissed off because none of my children will come with me to the lexington legends minor league baseball game with ernst and me tonight using free lux box tickets we got from our food supplier. all three, even the 9 year old produced lame reasons why they should not be forced to attend such a spectacle- hatred for the game of baseball itself seemed to top the list. the two of us may just go ourselves. ernst loves baseball, and his favorite memories of youth involve little league.  i will interject here that his worst memories involve baseball- the year that he was mvp neither of his parents bothered to attend a single game- they were too busy despite the fact that by that time all but 2 had moved out of the house....... i am ambivalent about the game- but look forward to seeing the new stadium and being with my beloved.  i would much rather be with all of my beloveds, sitting in a quaint baseball park, under the lights......

      ok, so i voted this morning on the way to work. it was just me that voted, i suppose, because it was only me and the voting site people while i was there. the last time i voted, in november, i waited for 2.5 hours in a winding line to get to the voting booth.  though voting for president was important, this election is everything local- people that can make or break things on a close-to-home level. i am ashamed that so few of my friends and neighbors appear to have bothered to come on in and vote.  i am also somewhat taken aback that so many people want to be sheriff- you would think that it was high pay and even higher prestige. happily we have had no shootings or murders or the like tied to our sheriff's race.  or lude videos in mudslinging  commercials for that matter.  i cannot vote for mayor or city commission- i would have preferred that ballot sheet.  i am not saying who (whom?) i would prefer for those slots, but i do have my hopes.....

      ok, so today is memorial day and i have the entire day off.  it is 9:00 am and i am still in my robe, having just finished reading the paper on the back deck with a lovely cup of hazelnut coffee and the faint trill of birdsongs.  we are comtemplating a trip with cayle to the cincinnati zoo- but i could easily lay around the house and do next to nothing except read, sleep and eat. it will be strange to go to cincinnati and not be able to drop by and see ernst's mom or dad. i believe that lisa has just sold their place in madeira, and that the will is in probate. i still find it hard to accept that ernst lost both his parents within the last year- BOTH.  his mother always had someone that she needed to take care of- her mother-in-law, her children, the sister with the brain tumor, her father, her husband. and when they were all gone, she died before she could simply enjoy life on her own.  we live in her father's house on the lake. ernst has many memories of family times here- both good and bad.  we still find vodka bottles, both intact specimens as well as broken pieces, to remind us that grandpa and aunt ginny found refuge from the world here with the help of copious amounts of alcohol. maybe today we should plant a tree in honor of ernst's parents- like we planted a forest pansy redbud a few years ago in honor of sister sylvia (of the brian tumor). yes, today, it may be fitting to just sit here at home with our memories, on this memorial day.

      ok, so i am still not over graduation.  it has occured to me that there are 3 classes of achievers (sp?)- first there are your straight-up achievers- the ones who have both aptitude and work ethic to use that aptitude to the fullest.  i was so proud of chiara levin, rowan haigh and tyler thompson at graduation-they each fit the bill when it comes to aptitude and work ethic.  next are the over-achievers. they make up for aptitude with strong work ethic and personal drive- there were a few people with 3.5+ gpa's who received no scholarships, possibly because they failed to have the test scores to go along with gpa. scholarship or no, they will proably do well in college because their work ethic will drive them to find enough paying work to fund college. ironically, their classmates may scoff at them, knowing that 'they aren't that smart' . smart or not, they still achieve, and this is a results-oriented world. lastly, there are the underachievers- os as chiara described them in her speech- the ones who sat back andlet high school just happen to them.  they are the ones with the brilliant test scores but mediocre gpas- the ones who have yet to live up to their potential.  if these individuals approach college in the same way that they approached hs, then they might as well flip burgers for the time being and save the money they would have spent on college.  higher education is wasted on the underachiever who  sleeps in class. or worse still, skips class altogether because extracurricular stuff like partying, computer games, and the like takes up all of ones time and energy. the underachievers  lack discipline, and somehow must find some in order to make an honest go of the future.  no names to the underachievers of the class of 2002. they know who they are. there is still time to change the road that they are on.

      ok, so i didn't cry at graduation until the end of the presentation of diplomas- the last guy, in a wheelchair, who ms cassidy noted was the first person in his family to graduate from high school.  boy, that really did it.  i had to take off my glasses to wipe away the tears because i couldn't see clearly for a moment there.  in my family, i cannot even be the first ph.d.- the most that i can say is that i am the only hyphen- this combo-name thing may begin and end with me....... i am not the only democrat- my mother tells me that my grandmother crown- the one who never learned to drive was also a democrat. i am certainly not the one with the most interesting midlife crisi- my cousin marilyn crown grodi, takes the cake- she is the one who has masters degree in home economics and decided to stay home with her children and do homeschooling, and at age 40 or so had her third baby, a 13 pound boy, at home with a midwife and no medication BUT with bleached blond hair (go figure.....) of course, what i see as a midlife crisis and is simply her life.   Now if have to sit back and see how andrew lives his life- for better or worse.  i went ahead and put together a memories poster for project graduation- with photos from birth, through montessori, bate and high school. he will not be pleased when he sees it, because he forbid me to do it- hence i did it anyway- had he been indifferent i might have forgotten altogether......anyway- back to the first to graduate from high school- wow- that used to be the american dream- to have enough leisure time to finish high school.  i cannot recall much of what the 5 (count-em 5) student speakers had to say, but i wil always remember the fellow who was the first to finish high school in his family, this was a proud, proud day.

      i heard yesterday about the remains of chaundra levy found in rock creek park in washington. i know that her parents will be relieved after this time to have closure to her disappearance, though no answers.  the worst part of having a child leave home is the worrisome reality that they will meet with a bad end- one that you were not able to protect then from, or warn them specifically about, or grab them back from- like a mother grabbing her child's coat to pull him out of oncoming traffic at a street corner.  letting go is really tough. this year, with andrew going out more and more, and coming in later and later, was simply a prelude to him not being home at all for weeks and/or months at a time. i will virtually have to trust that i have instilled in him some sort of survival skills.  my gut response is 'i am too old for this'- but i shouldn't look at it that way. rather, 'i am too young for this' that's it.  my parents seemed far older than i am now when i left home.  at least that's how i remember it. i couldn't be that old now.......

      ok, so i bought my family's third cell phone yesterday- we are almost to the limit of cingular's family share plan.......with andrew driving his ramshackle car he was always borrowing our phones in case something happened, and then either or both of us would not have a phone when we needed one.  so, he is sharing in on our 250 minutes a month plsu 3500 night and weekend minutes and the rest of our 2750 rollover minutes.....it is all so confusing and confounding- especially the part about free nationwide long distance- its free when you call from here out of the area- but not if you are out of the area calling home, because then you have to pay roaming charges. AND if two of our phones call each other, each phone has minutes deducted. how is it that i ever handled life without a phone in my car- nopt that i use the phone much- we averaged 20 minutes a month prior to andrew's line- but those 20 minutes seemed important at the time- in the rain with no payphone is sight and a need to know where someone was or a need to give out my whereabouts and/or destination.  I am now paying for 2 home lines and 3 cell phones- maybe we can give up our home phones and just use cell phones......hopefully the pesky telmarketers won't get my cell numbers any time soon.......

      ok, so today is my husband's birthday- his 47th birthday but the 1st that he will spend without his mamma.  he mentioned it last night- that this the 1st birthday without his mom or his dad (his dad died last july and his mom in february) that is so sad to be an orphan- even at 47 years of age.  he is coming to a late lunch with me at the restaurant- and we will have a late supper with cake and ice cream after cayle's soccer game.  he has requested new blue jeans (size 32/32- the size has not varied in 21 years of marriage) -straight leg- no buttons, no flares, no fancy pockets, rivets- just plain jeans. the ones he likes the best are from gap- i won't have time to run up there today- so i will take my chances with goody's after work. he has also requested a blood, sweat and tears greatest hits cd- just try to find that in danville at the last minute- we will pull something together to make this 47th birthday pleasant and special.

      ok, so i watched the 2 hour series finale of x-files last night, and am now more confused than i have been in my intermittent viewing of this show over 9 seasons. I was not a rabid fan, obviously, maybe because i like to get a good night sleep on sundays and that sort of thing would cause an uneasy night. anyway, i thought that the bringing up the presence of cross/jesus/god in the last 5 minutes of the season as a reason for hope in the future was a bit lame and gratuitous.  i thought that there were many unanswered questions, even for a show that will probably foster a few major motion pictures now that the weekly serial has ended.    i do plan to watch the series finale of ally mcbeal- i also anticipate a lame attempt to tie up loose ends- and i am sad that i am jaded about it before seeing it- i used to enjoy the show and find it banal and senseless in its attempt at madcap humor at this point.  ah, well- maybe she'll do the mary tyler moore thing and throw her hat up into the air..........

      ok, so i am the only democrat in my birth family- there- i am out of the closet so to speak- my only sibling is rabidly republican- my parents are republican- so much so that my mother tried to vote for my father in the presidential election because he couldn't vote for bush on his own......my aunt and uncle in cleveland are republican, my cleveland grandparents were likewise, as was my crown grandfather down on the farm in nashport, ohio, on the erie canal. my crown grandmother was a democrat- or so it was said- but she was so vested in traditional marriage that she never drove a car, so i guess it doesn't count.  of course, i am married to someone that i assume is democrat, after 21 years one forgets if one has actually asked these improtant questions, but i would be really surprised .........now that i have gottn that issue off my chest, i feel much better..

      ok, so last night i went with cayle and my mother to a mother-daughter event at her church. i have never done anything like this before, but it turned out that it was as important to my daughter as it was to my mother, so i went despite my fatigue and lack of enthusiasm.  the event was called "celebrating weddings at centenary' or something like that. the banquet room was decorated like a wedding reception. we played shower games at each table, there were bubbles and wedding favors at each place.....there were wedding pictures of church members (19 or so) and ballots so that you could guess on who was who....we sat at a table with a neighbor (around the corner and down a bit) who(whom?) i had never met, and her grown daughter from lexington.  we found ourselves discussing the big marijauna bust from last fall that took place in fields between us and the prison. you might not know about it because it happned on 9/10- and the account ended up in a tiny paragraph on the back page rather than a major story complete with photo given the tragic circumstances of 9/11.  we all talked about our emotions at seeing huey type transport helicoptors hovering over the horizon- like some sort of invasion force- at first we thought that it was a prison escape or some sort- then we deduced that it must be a drug bust. i can't recall the actual plant count- but it was sizable.  the plants were grown amongst the weeds rather than the traditional corn plants.  anyway, it was nice to have something in common with this woman who has lived near me without meeting me for over 20 years.  and it was nice to sit with my female family during the style show of wedding gowns.  only one woman in attendence could wear her own gown- jule and laura johnson, among others, modeled church member gowns- there was one dress that caused me to grow slightly nauseated- it was from a wedding in 1973- and it was the same pattern that i used to make my prom dress that year- and it looked horrid- i had an uncomfortable flashback- fashion deja vu is an ugly thing......after the style show we had punch and wedding cake in the parlor- cayle ate a large piece and since i had none- she sat on my lap.  for those who have had their daughters since birth, since may sound insignificant- but for someone who is inching up on a maternal relationship- this was huge.  she felt like getting up in my lap, and it felt right.  she is a daddy's girl at heart- probably because she feels the lack of knowledge about birth father, and because ernst is such a daddy kind of guy.  that is just fine with me- but we mothers need to have some physical connection with our children before they reject us- and cayle and i are still working on this.  i asked her if she wanted to try on my wedding dress one day- she just beamed at the notion.......   for what it is worth, i made my wedding dress in less than a week, for about 60 dollars including pattern, from a scetch i made of something i had seen in a bridesmade dress in a magazine. mean mamma doesn't do frou-frou.  it was a satin sleeveless sheath dress with a sheer organza overdress,  tea length, with a wide satin ribbon at the waist and tiny ribbons at the wrists.  it was simple yet elegant- i wore flat ballerina slippers and a refashioned version of my mothers veil attached to a lace kind of headpiece- the veil wouldn't stay on so i kind of heaved it during the ceremony and it is in few of the pictures. i have been told since that my hair was probably too clean.  21 years later, i really do still like that dress- its simplicity, its lack of pretense and expense, and the fact that i made it myself. princess di married the month after i did- with far greater expense and hoopla, and without the happy ending, alas....

      ok, so in the middle of a major catering job- in a tent in a field in the driving rain- my children disclosed that they both enjoy my blog but feel that the information provided is much too dangerous -like my name- and that the information that i share about them is much too personal. then came the ultimate insult- 'you know mom- your blog is almost as bad as grandma's christmas newsletter'    now that hurts.  my parents (and now just my mom) write this verbose christmas tome, with semi accurate information that is oh so personal to the point of liabel- my mother and i fell out for a time when she wrote about my miscarriage- and stated as fact that it would have been twins. the twins part was pure conjecture- and the inclusion of the miscarriage was quite upsetting. to this day i contend that their college friends from 1948-1952 did not need to know about my miscarriage.   therefore, i will compare each and every blog to a christmas newsletter from hell- and hopefully edit out any information that would similarly upset my children. of course, i really don't think that i have embarasses my children as much as could have been done........  anyway- back to the catering job- we in mud up to our shoetops, cold and exhausted. my sons helped put together the spinach salads, and the strawberry shortcakes. they chatted away during the entire process- it is so fulfilling for a mother, even the meanest mamma, to see her children having positive, fraternal interaction.  it was quite a special moment to see sons that used to be unable to be in the same room without the threat of physical violence to suddenly appear to enjoy the company and/or opinions of the other. .i might just cry remembering it.  merry christmas, boys......

      ok, so it has come to mean mamma's attention that her blog is hopelessly out of date- with it's color scheme, lack of snazzy scanned photos, etc, profile of 20 questions 'like how much weight have you gained since you got married?  none of your business, next question.......' of course, mamma is much too mean to care about looking dated- she may even switch to an avocado and coppertone theme to be totally 70's, her basic comfort zone.  i do watch that 70's show from time to time, and though i contend that none of my friends were that vacant anf shallow- the hairsyles and the clothing are right on target.  in fact, those wooden bottom sandals that the young ones are wearing these days were 'in' when i was a freshman in college- i wouldn't buy another pair- as they were horribly uncomfortable, made too much noise on most walking surfaces, and were easy to 'fall off of'.  as the teacher says, there is nothing new under the sun.....

      ok, so i have been thinking lately about spontaneity- whether i have it, or whether others should have it for me....and i have come up with the conclusion that i only have planned spontaneity. i spend my spare time thinking about places that i want to go, so that when i get a notion to go to those places, it may seem madcap and last minute- but is is anything but that.  i was listening to fresh air on npr coming back from picking up cayle from wednesday night church (that's right- i was not actually AT church with her, i stayed home and walked/read paper/drank wine....) the guest was an architect who has an article in this week's new yorker about what should be done with world trade center site-  he says that we need to wait, as time will tell us what the ground should be used for. he also said that whatever goes up should make a profound impact on the ny skyline, just like the trade towers.  something iconoclast....  that bit of on-air discussion started me thinking about planned spontaneity-  if i had not spent time thinking about going to ny- i might not have actually made plans to go when i got the invitation to sheldon's opening in ny a few years ago- and stephan and i would not have gone on the saturday morning of the long weekend to the world trade towers to buy tickets to cats- if we had waited until i reallyhad the money to go (yes- i charged it- but it is since paid off completely...) or a longer time to spend there (just 2 nights and 2 days) we wouldn't have gone, and my budding architect would never have seen the trade towers in their real-time steel and glass glory.  i have pictures of him standing in various places in front of various buildings, and thought nothing at the time, nor until this very moment about that part of our visit.  (yes, gentle readers, that visit has become synonomous with losing stephan in the subway at 11:00 pm on  a saturday night.......)   my father, the traveler, always contended that now is always the best time to go. you can't afford to wait until you retire, because circumstances could be worse then for the trip than they are now.  truer words have yet to be spoken, for at 73 he is hopelessly senile, and travels only to the dining room of the v.a. home, with help, in a wheelchair.  my father-in-law waited until he retired to live out his dream of going to florida over the winter, only to discover that he hated it- florida that is.  my dad lost 2 of his brothers -1 to cancer and 1 to a heart attack- before they were old enough to retire- they never went anywhere that the army didn't send them in wwII- and i regret this for them- they both bought into the' you don't travel until you have the money and have the time' lie.    ah well, enough of this ranting.  i am right this minute wishing that i was on a train bound for milan or florence or rome. if you should hear that i have actually gone ahead and done such a trip- be advised that i planned to do this crazy last minute thing all along......

      ok, so this is andrew's last full day of school, and mean mamma is being nostalgic and weepy thinking about his first day of montessori preschool back in 1987 when he was 3 years old and oh so glad to being going.  these days he is 17 and oh so glad to be not going any more. he considers high school pointless( didn't we all). i have sent a camera to school with my personal papparazzi, with a promise of a fat commission if he can somehow photograph this event. i am also working on tickets to graduation. it has occurred to me that my crowd-shy student may have avoided actually getting us tickets to graduation in hopes that we wouldn't/couldn't go and therefore he could just stay home that night- nothing doing. mean mamma requires a public graduation in return for support financially in future- this is an unwaivering threat- and mean mamma is just mean enough to follow through.....

      ok, so i suffered through an awards event where only 1 of 2 children tapped for awards bothered to shop up, i think this is gods way of prepping me for sunday when seniors are honored and my only senior doesn't show up.  at this point, i will be grateful if he actually shows up for graduation- the penalty for no-show at graduation is lack of parental funding at school, by the way......  this mean mamma was quite proud of both her boys- the one who showed up and the one who didn't.  acw received a presential scholar certificate, based on grade point average and achievement test scores . he also recieved an acadmic awards in psychology. scw received an academic letter, the social studies award (jointly with david s.) the french award, and the computor applications/keyboarding award.  he and david tied for awards tonight, with meghan de'arujio.

      so danville is not ready for shitake mushrooms. i used them today in my beef stroganoff, and most plates came back with the mushrooms picked out like they were some kind of evil ingredient.  I love their taste, especially in rich savory dishes- next time i will use plain old button mushrooms as not to confuse the populace.

      another mother's day for the mean mamma.  no breakfast in bed- not even a pot of coffee awaiting my descent into the kitchen.  ernst will remember that it is mother's day when the minister mentions it during the sermon,. then he will run by the store on his way home from church.  my mothers day gift generally comes from the krogers.......

      ok, i am going to pay tribute to a left -field candidate. tonight i gave a prom dinner for my 2 independent study students paige and caelin, and kelly the daughter of one of my servers.  14 students attended, and the only guest (other than paige and caelin) to really say thanks was sara wilson.  those who have followed the crown=webers since birth know that sara wilson has been in andrew's class since age 3 (montessori through 5th grade then bate then dhs). that means that i have known her for at least 15 years.  she looked like a million bucks, by the way, getting out of her dates mercedes convetable-  she is going to uk like acw, and i have offered a rec letter for sorority rush.  she was gracious and lovely in a princess grace kind of way- i would like to say the same of andrew/s date but he didn't bring her by the restaurant. ........  there has been much said about the racial mix at this party- caelin's mother has called about the particularl's more than once.....i have had much time to think about the race issue this week since learning that i have black kinfolk....i am especially pleased that my brother took this news well= he intends to research the black side of our family- i find it a relief- an instant point of reference that i lacked in this southern town- i feel blessed to be related to both underground railroad germans, and northern blacks- it kind of makes up for the lambsheim nazis and the northern ohio kkk kin.   anyway, my upwardly mobile brother intends to research my black heritage, and i amhappy- it could'nt be worse than my mormon heritage.....

      why is deja vu such an uncomfortable emotion/aura?  we had a group of 10 from bchs this morning-eating lunch as a reward for something- all but 2 actually ate something- these two were emaciated little things who tried to tell the server that they had just eaten breakfast- yeah right.  now, there are healthy looking naturally thin women- whose hair is glossy and whose skin has a nice glow. these two looked sallow, drawn, and with limp hair and a flat affect.  the deja vu part is hard- i looked just like that when i was a senior in high school and the sight of another such pitiful soul is hard to behold.  i couldn't eat for months because i was so upset that my sweet david w. started going out with my best friend susan b. to this day i really don't like susans as a rule- my stomach still churns.  of course, if it hadn't been for her i might have married my sweet david, who is now balding, fat, and working in d.c. i like being married to my sweet ernst, thank you very much susan b.- i am grateful that i got my appetite back at some point.......

      ok, so it is prom time, and this mean mamma is really hacked off about the whole thing.  i ordered the corsage, and have given over the check to pay for it.  i took in the tux to be drycleaned and borrowed the tie and cumberbund; ernst picked up the tux, and both washed and starched both shirts so that there would be a choice. now that the event happened tomorrow, there is apparently no actual promise that either of us will see him in his tux, nor see him with his date nor see any pictures that may be taken by others who have been granted audience with this pair, who are going to her mother's prom dinner rather than to the one that i am having here at the restaurant. now i can forgive him the prom party, as i am joyfully throwing it in his absense for my 2 indepedent study students and for my server's daughter.  but i cannot forgive the refusal of a showing prior to the prom.  i don't care how many couples will also be in the car- their parents want to see them too.  so what if they have to make 6 separate stops around town before the dance- them's the breaks.  i'll keep you posted on this prom sighting thing......

      ok so a couple of blogs ago i ranted a bit about sitcoms- but last night i have to admit that i sat and watched that 70's show and grounded for life with my older male adolescent children. of all the subject matter that they could have chosen, condoms was the theme for both shows.  on each, the use of condoms was promoted for use by married couples who do not choose to procreate at this time- and the consequences of unprotected sex- read this as a 'we love our children but we don't really want any more'  was made quite clear.  of course, the premise of the last show- everyone gathered around the closed bathroom door- the 3 kids, grandpa and daddy- while mamma takes the home pregnancy test would never happen in real life. i looked to my sweet boys and inquired if they knew what condoms were for, and urged them to use them as such- prompted looks that could cleave steel beams.   the good news is that condom education no longer must rely on liberal health education classes, or progressive physicians, parents etc to promote.  i am not so liberal as to have a fishbowl of them in my home- like centre college has in the health center- but i believe that there use is preferable to their disuse.......

      speaking of tom petty- there is a ragged people magazine here at the restaurant- a style issue of sorts- with a photo of madonna touting her fitness through yoga and diet and downright madonnaness... in which she looks like a corss between dwight yocum and tom petty.  now, those two are not my idea of an image to which one would choose to aspire- with regards to looks at least. madonna has oft dabbled in crossgender stuff, but this photo makes me unlikely to begin a yoga routine or give up carbs..........

      i got my hair cut today after the lunch rush. when my hair is in my eyes, i get really testy to be around- so when i asked if everyone could cover for me while i went in search of a walk-ins welcome hair salon, there were many offers........i got to read the george harrison tribute issue of rolling stone magazine. i enjoyed reading what people like tom petty, elton john, yoko, etc said about the dear departed. george is dear to me not so much because of strong beatles memories, but because i was born on his birthday and felt a special connection to him for as long as i can remember. i actually liked his work on the traveling wilburies album as much or more than most of the beatles or his personal stuff- he seemed to be having a really good time with bob dylan, et al.  tom petty recalled the making of the album- that george would hide in the bushes, and behind sofas, etc and video bob dylan any chnace he got- but especially when he was playing guitar or piano- harrison made his own bootlegs of his own personal idol.  apparently dylan got a kick out of harrison and his video camera.    the hair cut is passable......

      brushes with death leave one shaken but relieved- that's hopw i feel this morning after our family 'brush' with near disaster. andrew complained yesterday morning that he smelled something funny in the basement as he was leaving for school.  when ernst went down to check, he opened up the older of the 2 waterheaters, and noticed that sparks were flying, amid water draining out of the motor.  he got towels from the laundry room to mop up the mess, only to find flames coming out of the motor at this point.  we are so lucky that andrew mentioned the smell, as the flaming water heater was in our little storage cubbyhole with lots of stored books, files, and other flammables- the place could have gone up in smoke.  by the time i got home, the plumbers had installed a new element, and the hot water was again functional. whew........  it has just occured to me that ernst and i missed 24 on tuesday night while we visited with our relatives. this is a really confusing and intense show- it has only a few episodes left- i have ahard time seeing a happy ending to it all. of course, the world of television is no longer about happy endings.  my prediction about the last episode of ally mcbeal is that she will be left all alone after 5 years of dating and discarding all those mr wrongs.  of course, i harbor a secret wish that robert downey jr will show up on the last episode and sweeep her off her feet-the cinderella ending, but he is probably in jail for probation violations so that is unlikely.  at this point in my life, i would rather follow along with a good book for 1 or so hours a day than to try to keep up with sitcoms or tv dramas. i do enjoy alias on sunday nights- enjoy sitting with my spouse and watching alias on sunday nights- but  mostly don't make time for primetime.  i wish i had a nielson rating box so i could destroy the curve.....

      yesterday was a day from hell- the rain, the rain, the rain.......came down so fast that water starting coming in under the cinderblock foundations in the stockroom, and on into the back dining room where a downtown preservation meeting was taking place- somewhat ironic- as i wouldn't dream of preserving this wretched building.  we had to make desparate calls for shop vacs to suck up the water- the wretched landlord took one look at the onslaught and left. on a brighter note- the front dining room windows did not leak now that jerry's dad fixed the roof, a job for which the wretched landlord has not paid him.  wretched is my word of the day- thanks to ann silver's sister in boulder, co- hello ann's sister!! i am not nearly as mean as i seem in writing.......

      my mother's first cousin, dr. bruce broughton and his wife mary are visiting from arizona.  we have not seen them since we took the children to grand canyon the first time on a spring break at least 11 years ago. he was a surgeon on the navaho reservation at the time- now he and his wife are retired. he is the adopted son of my grandfather george broughton's eldest brother harold- the one with polio who became a minister. the family myth was that he was found on harold's parsonage doorstep and that harold moved to a church out of state after the papers were signed so the birth parents couldn't ask for him back. bruce said that this wasn't true- that he had been 2 years old when he was adopted and that he found the birth parents name and address in his parents belongings- he always understood that a friend of his father's had arranged it all.  he was quite kind about it all to cayle, telling her that they had this special thing in common.    in the course of the dinner last night, with mother and her sister and her husband and all of us- i am not sure who trys to monopolize the conversation more- mother, or her sister- it was an evening to sit back and marvel.  one interesting bit of trivia- one of grandpa broughton's uncles married a black woman- and was basically ostracized from that point on- mother remembers her grandmother broughton telling them that they really didn't want to know what had happened to this uncle. therefore, there are black broughtons walking around this earth related to me through my greatgrandfather.  i hope they are better looking than some of the ones i have met.......

      ok, so i saw 5- count 'em 5 snakes in my yard yesterday, and i am elated.  i am not a snake fancier, nor one of those scary snake handler-bible belt types.  i do see good environmental signs in having a healthy crop of snakes.  for starts- my yard is nearly pesticide-free(read this as too mean to remember to put pesticide on my plants)- so there are no chemicals to kill off reptiles. secondly, the kinds of snakes we have appear to be the kind that keep down the rodent population- we are not seeing mice in the house these days.  the rodent thing is according to ernst- i haven't gotten close enough to these snakes to know what kind they are- ecw says king snakes and i will take his word for it.  they are big and long and 3 seem to live together in a commune on the other side of the deck.  the others are garter snakes, smaller- who live amongst the rose bushes.  as i said, the appearance of healthy snakes must mean that our environment is relatively healthy for us humans.  i will feel even better about it if i start seeing frogs- nonmutated frogs, that is.......  we have a mourning dove nesting in our trellis rose bush- poor girl has found a little place among the thorns to nest- you gotta love any mother who would risk so much for her young.

      ok, i know that there is already a saint stephan- and many churches named after him. but there lives in danville a saintlier stephan- the one who kindly came into work last night when we got busy after an even busier day without our dishwasher who was at the hospital with his pregnant wife who was in premature labor. our saint stephan is an incredibly persistent worker- who asks what can i do next rather than when can i go home.  i am thankful to know him let alone be mean mamma.......  today's agenda involves a derby party for 36, with fried chicken.  it seems that i lack the fried chicken gene- i have never fried chicken, i have never witnessed an older female role model fry chicken, and i have never felt an urge to do so in my own home. one time our regular babysitter couldn't sit, so we found a pinchhitter through a friend- he lasted one day there- when she was frying chicken, andrew got too close to the skillet and the flying hot grease burnt his cheek. the sitter laughed it off like he should have known better- andrew wasn't from a frying family so he would have had no clue.  i have out all of the central kentucky cookbooks- open to the secret fried chicken recipes.  frankly, this whole fried chicken thing makes me a nervous wreck.....

      our deep-pockets customer last night (read this drug rep with a mandate to spend his budgeted bucks rather than lose them) was truly annoying. he arrived after many of his clients with the promised wine and beer- in the rain- and handed me several bottles of red and barked at me to chill them as quickly as i could.  gentle reader, surely even you know that red wine is best at room temp- or thereabouts- not chilled, which i pointed out as politely as possible- he studied me for a second, probably trying to decide if i would really know such as thing about wine- i knew enough to know that his australian red was probably better than his argentinian red.  the whites he bought were already chilled, and he requested that the argentinian white be opened first- rather than the australian one.  in my book, a good host leads with his best wine, not his worst..... then he thrusts a bag at me holding new corkscrews- like we wouldn't have one ourselves.  he also brought beer, a lot of beer- 2 cases of miller and 2 of bud light, and 3 6-packs of heineken. he seemed interested in putting out the  cans of miller and bud rather than the good stuff- we did put it out because this was a crowd that would like that kind of beer. the dinner did go ok, as these dinners go we had to quick make an extra salad and dinner for someone who had been in the bathroom all this time....the rep ordered 30 dinners, and only 19 showed up.  the main plate was served about 7:45- at 9:30 as we are about to go home, the rep decides that he wants all of the leftovers wrapped up so he can take them home. they had been long wrapped up in the refrigerator- and he stood there watching while i tried to reassemble boxed dinners from them. yes, he did pay for them, but he was such a jerk in insisting on his rightful property.  he actually was crass enough to ask if he had everything that he had paid for.....i thought he was going to go through the refrigerators himself. he then preceded to chase down the doctor who did the presentation at her car and gave her several of the boxed dinners,like he did it all himself, just for her.  funny, when we were turning out the lights, i happened upon a 6-pack of heineken that he had somehow overlooked in his zeal to get all of the pork and chicken boxed dinners- i  could have run out the door after him to make sure that he had the last of the beer, paid for with his company card.... no gentle readers, i took them home myself......ernst really likes good beer....

      i went to a site today called no more tears to cry- maybe that was it- the computer locked up and i didn't get to actually read it- it sounded like just another middle-aged-mother-with-teenaged-children blog. maybe i should find some blogs written by my-children-are-perfect-faced lifted mothers so i can snarl at them. of course, those mothers probably pay for someone to blog for them. because all this typing would damage the pretend nails and expensive chanel enamel. ........

      i am giving a prom party for the 2 dhs students who did the indepedent study here last semester, as well as for the daughter of one of my servers. there will be about 18 in the group, including friends and dates.  yesterday the mother of one got in my face and asked me if i knew that her daughter's date was black.  i knew because she told me, and had to admit such. this mother was embarassed that she was so upset about the race thing- and upset seemingly because i did not pick up the phone to tell her.  i didn't tell her because it was of no concern to me- the race thing- she should be more  worried that this boy is 22 or so - but i din't go into that because she was so upset.  i am not sure what she wanted me to say or do about it. these are nice girls- and i told them they could invite their friends- end of story. i cannot wait until all of this end-of-year stuff is over.......

      yesterday was may day- and i had meant to blog about my roses- i had two bushes blooming yesterday. this is quite early for roses, but then it has been quite warm. the first to bloom was stanwell perpetual, which i saw blooming in great splendor years ago at hidcote gardens in the cotswolds. it started to bloom on 4/23/02- probably the earliest that any c-w rose has bloomed. the blooms are tiny, cream-colored, and delicately scented, and i have only a few (reads this as too lazy and mean to fertilize regularly) blooms. therese bugnet bloomed on 4/29/02- and this bush also has only a few blooms- a rosey pink that has a bit of white streaked through.  i say blommed, fo course- after the megastrom last night there may be nothing left.  andrew, stephan and i watched the multi-warnings on tv, and were overjoyed that the path of the potential tornado veered south of danville.  the rain and possibly hail was intense for a time, however.  neither will bother my new dawn rose, however, it is already dead, after 20 years i tried to move it and killed it.  finding another may take some time....

      i went to 'dirty laundry''s blog today- she wrote about how her closet smells of vanilla- even her shoes, which should smell quite poopy.....she cannot figure out where the vanilla smell is coming from. my closet does need some attention. the crate of summer clothes is in the way, but not yet emptied and filled with the winter clothes. i need to sort throught it all, as i wore relatively little of the winter things- read this as cannot get into.....it might be emotionally freeing to just pitch it all to the goodwill and start over with a minimum of well-selected pieces.that would leave room for a few sachets of maybe lavender or rose to scent the remaining clothes.  tht sounds too martha- i take it back.......

      ok, so the bikers have reached pueblo, co and estimate another 2 days/140 miles of riding before they hit the kansas border.  today the temp was at least 108 degrees.  stephan said that it was like riding in a full-body blow dryer.  they plan to get up early and ride the next 2 days before the heat or the wind get testy.  speaking of hot, when does the loyal opposition travel down to texas?  i hope that the texas clan are e-connected.......

      ok, so my multi-summer watermelon curse is over.......today i successfully purchased a delcious watermelon. my technique seemed no different than past failures- thumps with the thumb in search of one with a hollow sound. for summers in past memories, these hollow thumps were false alarms, and the melon destined for racoon dessert, thrown over the hill.  not this melon- it is sweet and succulent and juicy- i may not even share it with the kids......

      ok, so i had the best cake yesterday afternoon, and i am not really a cake person.  the wedding cake was made by someone named leigh. it was white, moist, flavored with some sort of raspberry liquour, with raspberry jam spread thinly between the layers.  divine........the wedding was typical of those i have catered- people become out-of-control in the buffet line- taking 4 beef tenderloin buns and 20 shrimps, and mounds of artichoke dip and skipping the vegetable basket.  we always set aside a few of each item for the bride and groom to take with them- because most of the food is eaten by the guests before the spotlight couple ever make it to the buffet line themselves.......i did find amusement/fear of lawsuit in watching one particular guest, whose fanny was twice as wide as the chair on which she sat- we should be like southwest airlines, and charge extra for those who really need two seats.......i am somewhat surprised that she didn't collapse the chair splat to the ground......

      ok, so i left 6 pork roasts, at 350 degrees  in the oven overnight. ......i stopped at the kroger on the way to work to replace them- at the 1.99 per pound pork madness sale, and had the best time just people watching.  i got caught behind a woman in the cracker aisle who had one ear to her cell, and the other handling each item on each shelf. the was conversing with her significant other about their mutual need for each and every item...... so much for shopping lists.  i checked out in aisle 7. there was a couple in aise 8- the wife loudly proclaimed that her husband should have chosen aisle 9, because that line was shorter, whereupon he started in arguing that the lady in aisle 9 has a lot of stuff underneath her cart...........there was a man in the check-it-yourself aisle who appeared to be a near-dwarf- his children who appeared to be about 7 or 8 were almost as tall as he was.......i left the kroger with an amused and uplifted soul......and yes, when i got to work, those pork roasts were like charred logs.........

      ok, so i enjoy writing in my blog, and this enjoyment may help me to live longer.......last night i sat and watched a 60-minutes wanna-be whose i can't recall with an hour-long special on stress.  they followed around 7 people and had them wear blood pressure monitors to confirm which situations in their lives were the most stressful compared to the stress that each individual perceived.......the stay-at-home mom actually got more stress out of dealing with traffic and her spouse then with her  small children, which surprised me. they didn't follow around a restaurant entreprenuer, so i cannot take much of the personal stories to heart, but i can ponder the 10 top ways to reduce personal stress- the list included 'writing in a personal journal'. a psychiatrist noted that journaling is even more effective in talk therapy in helping people work through their anxieties.    of course, some things can't be worked through- like the realization as i awoke this morning that i left something in the oven last night and that the pilot light has probably burnt it to a crisp.  assuming the building is still standing when i arrive, i will have to start over.......there was a stress test involved with this tv program- and did give points for having to do too manythings at once............  stephan and ernst are in silverthorn, co, staying overnight at a condo owned by friends of bill and pearl, who met my parents at osu over 50 years ago.  when i called, they were fixing to eat a watermelon, which is a shared joke between families. years ago, when my parents and bill and pearl, and many of the 'couples' who had dated in college got together for a little reunion, they sat and ate watermelon, with humerous antics like spitting seeds involved somehow- the story seemed more compelling when i heard it at age 5 than it does now- but they were eating watermelon in this condo and having a good time. ernst reported that they had had some sort of equipment breakdown- and that bill had helped him to gerryrig a solution.  the condo is located near breckinridge, and is quite tony and expensive.  today they ride up and over hoosier pass- the highest they will be on this trip.  pray for them.......

      ok, so i am looking forward to hearing what eminem does with aerosmith's dream on. i heard an interview on tv last night of steven tyler, discussing the permission granted to the rapper to do a revisit to this classic tune- i can recall sitting with my little brother in the driveway of our house, sometime after i had my liscense- with the 8-track cranked up- listening to the orginal version, from the toys in the attic album.  that could easily be 30 years ago......i appreciate the comments of the loyal opposition about songs with upfront lyrics- so many artists like to modulate the voice to the point that the words themselves become indistinct enough to be meaningless. i have often thought this about opera- it is as if the prima donna is actually just singing notes, and there really aren't words attached.......on the other hand, bob dylan tends to make up new lyrics to old songs as he gets older- either that or he can't quite recall the words he wrote so he just wings it..... and of course, some songs contains such mumblings he could be reading off his grocery list..........

      ok, so i agree with the appeals court in california over this pledge thing- when congress added God to the pledge in 1954 they WERE putting church into the state's business.  i can remember saying the pledge in elementary school- i do not feel that it has made me into a better american to have said it. i am sure that charles manson, martha stewart, and amy fisher once pledged allegiance , and it certainly didn't put them on the right road toward model citizenship. i hate to see us as a nation get all mccarthy-like looking for unamerican behavior., when it was the search for personal freedom that brought us all to america. while i have the freedom to worship my version of god, i do not wish to force others to do so.   i heard a congressmen quoted on npr this mroning who was drafting a law tro make those children have to say the pledge, and his words made me physically ill- allegiance is something that we should never force anyone to do- think nazis and heil hitler- it is the same thing to force americans to pledge allegiance to god when individuals may not believe in god and believing in god does not make one an american. my brother no longer goes to church because he contends that that is where the hypocrites all congregate- he has a point- making people pledge allegiance to god will not make them want to believe in god- only individuals living a virtuous life can lead anyone toward belief in a higher power through personal testament.  i am also against school prayer, for the same reasons.........

      ok, so the letter to the editor in yesterday's advocate about grey friar's bobby and the dedication/devotion that some dogs have to their owners may have been in reference to the crazy lady who wants the dog  buried next to her parents exhumed. alas, the letter writer failed to tie the two stories together, and therefore seemed a bit crazy herself to be talking about a scottish dog, then a junction city dog without highlighting some relevant point. speaking of canine devotion, my mother's dog muffet continues to be under my feet at every turn. i could do with less devotion........  ernst and stephan are headingout this morning from walden, colorado. their ride yesterday was uphill and into the wind all day, and this day's ride appears to be more of the same.  they will meet up with boulder,co-based college friends of my parents over the weekend- bill and pearl are in their 70's, but are more fit and adventuresome than many 50 year olds.  they are the couple that ernst wants us to be when we are in our 70's.  fine, as long as i don't have to ride uphill and into the wind........

      ok, so the raging storm came and went before the swim meet, and it happened after all.  i sat through 3 hours and 45 minutes of pure boredom- doing consulting paperwork and enduring the comments of those not doing paperwork at the pool. if i hear 'don't you ever rest?' one more time i believe that i will just go off.  when your child swims for 1.5 minutes every 45 minutes or so, something has to take up the slack time- might as well do billable work while i sit..........and the mean mamma wouldn't even stay for the potluck.........

      ok, so meanmamma is praying for a raging thunder storm so the swim meet will be canceled and i can just take cayle home and chill out for the evening.  we are into our 4th day without ernst and stephan, and knock on wood it is going ok- no tantrums, no blowups, no need for time outs. andrew has been exceptionally nice to cayle, and she seems to respond to this kindness with pleasant behavior.  i just hope her medication holds out...........

      ok, so it turns out that stephan was right about grackles- on the news tonight it was reported that west nile virus has been found in 2 dead grackles in some rural location in ky- west nile virus rarely kills humans according to this report- jst flu like symptoms.  of course, it appears to be deadly to grackles.......  stephan called tonight- he and ernst rode 61 miles today. they had a bit of excitement yesterday while still driving on the interstate- someone was smoking outside the reststop bathrooms, and through a lit cigarette into the bushes, and started a fire- right there in front of ernst and stephan- they helped the staff put it out, but not before there was a large patch of grass left in charred ruins. stephan said that everything is very dry- they are actually in wyoming- they started the colorado ride across the border- for reasons known only to themselves..he was mostly interested in the cracker barrel openign- i forgot to tell him about the dog burial....maybe next time.

      ok, so i have had it with this woman in johnson county who is raising a ruckess over rocky fout, a 12 year old cocker spaniel buried 9 feet from her parents.  is this woman just noticing that this was a dog not a person, or has this dog just been buried?  are her parents canina phobic?  my picture of a pleasant eternity could include a cat or a dog on my lap, under a shady tree.......why can't her parents, both dead, of course, embrace the same eternal rest with rocky- kind of adopt him.  turns out that ky has no law banning the mixed burial of humans and canines or felines, or sharks and doplhins for that matter.  this woman's ruckess sounds as foolish and complaining that her parents are buried next to blacks or hispanics et al.......she had better worry about the bigger things- like are the couple on the other side actually married or did they just shack up, did the father beat the mother, or were they involved in extramarital affairs..........will cemetaries begin to require character references lest people get concerned about one's eternal roomates.....it could be worse- those lucky enough to be buried next to jim morrison in pere lachaise in paris have to endure the wiffs of the lit joints left by doors fanatics.............

      ok, so we are not yet 48 hours into this 2 week bicycle thing, and already those of us left behind in danville are pretty fed up with grandma's dog, muffet. she is a maltese, rescued from a puppy farm, and should evoke sympathy rather than disdain.  however, one cannot  move about in this houyse without that dog underfoot, with her toenails making noises on the tile floor. i keep stepping on her feet because she is always underfoot.  she cannot just lay upon the couch (yea, we don't let our dogs lay on the furniture......) and just chill out- no she has to follow us around l;ike she will miss something if she isn't close art hand.    andrew and i walked last night, around the circle, after it had cooled off (somewhat).  we were on our 3 or 4th lap when a lowe's truck pulled up in front of my mother's house.  we both looked at each other- what did she buy and why didn't she tell us to expect a truck, and she certainly doesn't need what she bought........turns out if was a false alarm- they were looking for an address on gwinn island road not the circle- and they finally drove off.  such relief.  with my dad in the nursing home, we are quite protective of how my mother spends her money........when we bring in her mail we sift through all fo the catalogs, special offers, and the like for immediate discard..........

      ok, so i enjoyed snatch, in spite of its connections to madonna, who(m) i loathe. i thought the parts with the dog were just too funny.  today, gosford park comes out in video, so i will run by the titlewave and see if i can score a copy.  also this week- a beautiful mind- which i also can't wait to see.  i just can't seem to get to theatres before these movies have moved on- but videos will just have to do.  speaking of madonna, i hear that she is pregnant again with guy ritchie- madonna is nearly my age- in better shape and much wealthier- but still in in 40's and absolutely crazy to be having a baby that will be starting college the year she can collect her social security. i can hardly handle children who drive at my age, let alone change diapers. of course, madonna surely changes no diapers- that is what the nanny is for.............

      ok, so mean mamma gets really mean during transitions.  ernst and stephan are packing up my mom's car, and the trio will soon leave for colorado.  my mom will drop them, and their tandem bike,  off somewhere across the border in wyoming, and meet them at the end of each day with a hotel room, until they reach the kansas border.  this trip has mean mamma in a bundle, because it appears that most of colorado is on fire, bikes are vulnerable to car traffic, my mother is not the driver she once was when it comes to attention to the road.........oh, so many disasters are possible, and mean mamma has worried about each and every potential fly is the ointment.    then there are the worries at home- cayle will be spending 2 weeks at camp two roads cafe.  ernst usually takes care of daycare, as he has always had more flexibility in his schedule.  he also has a backroom with a tv/vcr that has served us well over the years as place for kids to chill out until a better option comes along.  in the restaurant we have no such backroom, so cayle will hang out in the kitchen, or with customers.......i hope this 2 weeks passes quickly.    i rented movies last night, thinking that they would be leaving yesterday afternoon- i watched laura linney in you can count on me, for which she was nominated for an oscar.  i thought she did a fine job, but couldn't quite figure out why they cast that particular actor as her ne'er-do-well brother.  he did not seem to be related to her at all, in looks or demeanor.  not that all siblings have noticable similarities, but these two had none- i aalso rented snatch- but haven't watched it yet. i have til midnight tonight- maybe i can watch it later on tonight and beg andrew to drive it back into town...i haven't seen a first run film since lord of the rings- and there are many out there that i want to watch.  i want to see the importance of being earnest at the kentucky- i can recall seeing the play in college with a man named maynard that was a fixup date- he told me that he couldn't seriously consider going out with me on a regular basis until i stopped being so stuck on myself- i still laugh about that from time to time- only a man totally stuck on himself would think to say such a thing to a blind date.........the play was good, though. i trust the movie will be in true bbc-style, with the usual cast of period costume players, like colin firth. reese witherspoon is also in this picture, though i am not sure which part she plays.  my family has given me grief for watching legally blonde more than once- i can't see the difference between watching that movie and all 6 pride and predjudice videos over and over- it is all escapist behavior.  or maybe i really just want a chijuaha to call my own......  well, back to this bike trip. gentle readers,bear with me until these travelers are back.........

      ok, so my last blog, the one about wilma brown, has disappeared.  wilma brown is my new hero/heroine, based on her brave decision to publically get signatures on a wet-dry petition so that the fine citizens of boyle county can decide for themselves whether or not alcohol may be legally consumed in these environs.  i don't know which makes me madder- theblog vanishing or the fact that i have to drive 27 miles to buy a bottle of wine.  i am also unsure about the correct term for wilma- hero or heroine- heroine somehow makes me think of cheap romance novels- not brave female role models.  wilma is perfect for this role- she has retirement income, as well as private funds from painting, which are nearly immune from economic pressure from the opposition- someone like myself, whose livelihood depends on public goodwill, could easily be bankrupted by those who dislike my opinion on alcohol sales.  further, wilma has no children nor spouse, who can also be subjected to public riducule/personal attacks based on wilma's actions.  presumably she isn't worried about getting kicked out of her church.......an aside- when i bought the restaurant, i was told by a co-worker that i would probably be kicked out of my church if i allowed customers to bring in their own alcohol or if i eventually sold it myself in the event of a successful wet-dry vote.  i replied that i would simply rename the place cana- as in the wedding at can where jesus turned water into wine- and let the opposition throw the first stone........i run into people from my church at the liquor barn - so i am clearly not the only one in my congregation, nor in my sunday school class who imbibes....  so back to wilma, she has many connections, with many subgroups in danville- the intellecutals, the college, the artistic, the librarians/teachers, the gentry- i can see her getting the signatures by august, and getting this thing on the ballot by november.  where do i sign., wilma?

      ok, so mean mamma has had a revelation about cable television, cellphones and other techy stuff.  if mean mamma wasn;'t quite so mean, she would backoff on this lifetime cable tv ban and be watching us-germany on espn instead of blogging at this very moment.  not that i am a soccer hooligan, but i like to watch on occassion.  on the other hand, mean mamma is now paying for 3 family talk phones- which means that mean mamma has a deep need for communication/opportunity for human contact in emergencies- and is much more willing to pay for that than for mere entertainment.  paying for cable tv will not get you a tow truck when your car is broken down soemwhere.  i will just have to read about this landmark soccer game in the paper tomorrow morning.......the paer only costs 50cents........

      ok, so i like to reread books- mostly because i am an impatient reader the first go-round, and read books through quickly to see what happens in the plot line. the second and subsequent readings are get the finer points of plot development that i missed while finding out what happens in book.  this week i dug up sylvia plath's the bell jar- a book about the poet's dip into madness while she was in college- not to be confused with her dip into madness as an adult mother just before she killed herself.  the bell jar reminds me of catcher in the rye- for its first person narrative as well as for its strung out and acutely described late-night outings in new york city. in each book there is a feeling that the madness involved was a coping mechanism- that the madness was somehow the only option for the hero/heroine. in the bell jar there is a poignant scene where upon the heroine is standing nearly naked in her hotel room window throwing her ill-fitting but newly purchased clothing out of the window- one piece at a time.  it is something that only a madwoman would do- throw new clothes out the window- 'sane' women hold onto them whether they fit or not until the closet just cannot contain them anymore.  the heroine seems the sort of woman who is compliant to the will of others about what she should be doing with her college career, her time in nyc, her choice of boyfriend and her life in general. i see this book as a handbook for independent minded women if only to show them what NOT to do.  next i think i will dig up catcher in the rye, and see how h. caufield's madness compares.......

      ok, so i have to report on something really funny that tompoland said to me last night at the potluck after the twinkie run.  we were contemplating the big urn of artificial flowers that the church had outside its front door- int he summer when real flowers could actually grow- mind you- and tom started commenting about how they (the church) could probably add to their collection by going to yard sales- that there were usually a great assortment of artificial flowers at yard sales, and don't their colors seem to improve with age?  he then digressed into a concept idea for an exhibit at the smithsonian- there hasn't been a definitive display of these american icons at the smithsonian- maybe he would start his own collection and then donate them to the smithsonian and be the curator-  like most funny episodes, you really had to be there.  but the thread throughout his rant/monologue is worth retelling and rehashing.  there is a house on gwinn island road that used to have fake flowers in its window boxes 24/7 and 12 months out of the year- like the neighbors wouldn't be fooled by geraniums peaking out of a blanket of snow. the cemetary in burgin has a large sign posted at the gate- no artificial flowers- yet each grave is adorned with a walmart-grade array of red, white and blue blooms.  in europe, graves have their own mini-garden in front, with real petunias, marigolds, and geraniums in season, and ground covers the rest of the year.  a brief note to my own family- no fake flowers near my urn when i am gone......please.........maybe just a genuine single orchid......... when we bought the restaurant we carried out garbage bag after bag of fake greenery- the space had been a shrine to unreality when it came to silk flowers and vines.  people still comment on how our decor was more charming then.....  these summer days, when i work long hours and have such little personal time, i relish my early morning hours on the deck, with all of my pots of marigolds, herbs, petunias, geraniums, etc- i sit at the table, with a tablecloth, mind you, and read the paper, with my coffee, and take in the sweet serenity of the flowers along with the lake, the birds, and my dogs wanting in the house.  the cat is much more vocal- she won't stop caterwalling until the is let into the house. the dogs are content to just sit under the table until i am ready to go in the house....the scene just wouldn't be the same with 26 pots of silk greenery- they don't need watering and the heat can't kill them, but they have no fresh scent, have no buds to watch until they open, and little to offer in terms of enjoyment.  enough said.......mean mamma's quiet morning timeis over and she has to go to work.

      ok, so mean mamma has had a wicked witch experience. tonight was the 20th annual twinkie run out buster pike north of town- the twinkie is a concept event- you, or you and a partner, estimate your time for a 6.2 mile run, and then you run without a watch. the person or team who comes closest to the estimated time wins......the event is always in min june, on the hottest day of the year, when i have no interest in walking let alone running. i have partnered with ernst in the past, but this year i opted to ride a bike as cayle's chaperone.  ernst lent me his mother's raleigh 3-speed, which is an upright model with a basket.  i kept hearing miss gulch's theme music as i rode that bike down the road-if only i had her outfit and her nose........not that htis image has anything to do with my feelings for my departed mother-in-law- but the bike is certainly wizard of oz caliber.......

      ok, so i have become nostaligic for watergate, the scandal of my youth. yesterday marked the 30th anniversary of the watergate breakin, and the beginning of the end for tricky dick nixon and his cronies.  no matter what maybe said about bill and monica- a few private sexual acts simply do not compare with the likes of ambitious, paranoid dick nixon- his enemies lists, his surveilience of said enemies, his harassment of said enemies (irs audits, etc), and of, course, the breakin at the headquarters of the democratic national committee. nixon wanted to be reelected so badly that he put all decency aside to make it happen.  i have enjoyed the recent flood of speculation on the identity of deep throat- the inside source for the washington post who broke the story of the connection between the white house and the watergate breakin- and followed the story until nixon resigned.  some have narrowed the list to include pat buchannan, who was working in the white house at the time.  some say that woodward and berstein made him up. of course, deep throat could be a woman- i would like to think that someone in nixon's own family had some moral fiber and used the role as anonymous source to make things right. no matter, we will not find out the identity until the person in question passes away, which could be years.

      ok, so no matter where i went this band festival weekend, the big question was about the police raid- were you there, and what really happened?  the tale is that people actually drove down from cincinnati to the antique show to based on what they heard on npr about the incident- no one can quite fathom that there are places in america that are not free to buy or sell alcohol- they can sell guns, and cigs but no beer or wine or worse,.......we just can't be trusted with the stuff.   of course, i was offered a beer within 5 minutes of arriving at the picnic on saturday night (9:15 pm after we finally finished up at the restaurant), but the host poured it into a plastic cup to be on the safe side......the lunch crowd was much thinner on sunday than on saturday, so we closed at 2:00 and were home by 4:00.  it felt like the 24 hours at LeMans, the race that is constant on a closed course- it just goes until it is over.   one comment on some of the sights- i saw an older couple walking down our little street- wearing matching pants, shirts, hats, and binoculars- if ernst and i ever get to the point of wearing identical clothes, then my children have full rights to have us declared incompetent..........

      ok, so our big catering job last night was marred by a police raid.......3 undercover cops looking for illegal service of alcohol in a dry county.  luckily, we brought only virgin daquiris and marguiritas, but some local idiots went home and brought their own alcohol back to the party when they discovered that the party was 'dry'- and of course they were found out when the police started checking every glass. the police tried to impound every dollar brought in by the fundraising event (for heart of danville) - it could get pretty ugly considering that the city manager tells us that we have a case for harassment in that they went through all; of our catering supplies looking for alcohol without a search warrant.....i was so embarassed that this happened at the antique show preview party with all of those out-of-town dealers- the whole affair made danville look like hickville.

      ok, so today is our 21st wedding anniversary.  where has the time gone.........?  today is much like the day we married- rainy and dismal- rather ironic that we have sustained many dismal days through grad school, parenting, and job changes with mostly smiles on our faces and happy hearts.  ernst brought flowers and a card to the restaurant this morning- we will have our champagne some other day because i am catering tonight, and working the weekend here due to the band festival.  tomorrow morning we plan to celebrate andrew's 18th birthday over an early breakfast- i can't believe that it was 18 years since he was a tiny baby- oh my.......

      ok, so we are starting to get the really crazy people on the phone at the restaurant this week. the first call of the day was a woman who wanted the name of our source for dry ice.  'you don't use dry ice in catering?' she asked incredulously.  'no. we use regular wet ice.....'  i couldn't even tell her where she could begin to look for dry ice, either.  then we got a call from ohio asking if we could deliver lunches and suppers to her mother in union, ky.  i assured her that union is nowhere near here, at least not in a 40 mile radius, and suggested that she get out her map and try to find a closer restaurant. she woman seemed somewhat miffed that we weren't willing to go that far afield to deliver lunch.....then we go the call from a woman who wanted my assurance that if she made a supper reservation for saturday night of the band festival that she would have a guarenteed place to park outside the restaurant.  i assured her that by saturday night not even i would be guaranteed a place to park. she seemed kind of miffed, like someone couldn't just stand in a spot and hold it for her.........then we got a call from someone asking if we are hiring. ' not hiring? well who IS hiring? who else besides cracker barrel? you don't know? well why not?'   then we had the unfortunate conversation with a woman who had booked a lunch and supper for today , from a major financial advising company, to drum up investment business.  jerry called her to get a menu and an updated head count, and the woman insisted that she had already spoken to a gentleman on friday with all of the info.  jerry insisted that he had not spoken to her on friday, and she started to get testy- and said ' you told me that your specialties were country ham and fried chicken. jerry replied that neither of those are our specialties, and could she have been mistaken on who she called. oh,no, the woman said, i have it all written down- i talked to _____at beaumont inn on friday......well there is your problem, you didn't book your meeting at the beaumont inn........needless to say, she is having her meeting at the beaumont inn....now if this company manages money like it arranges meetings, then i pity any who attend and/or sign on for their services.  of course, if she actually sent out the invites to our place rather than beaumont, it could be very funny today around noon........

      ok, so this morning on npr john feinstein commented on the plethora of major sporting events that took place this weekend- the tyson fight, the nba finals, the french open, the world cup, the stanley cup, the belmont/triple crown. of these mean mamma only watched the belmont stakes, of which coverage lasts 1 hour for a race that lasts only 2-3 minutes at most. i was disappointed that war emblem couldn't pull off a victory- racing and breeding in ky could have used that boost to ratings.    i was most disappointed that i wasn't able to watch either the men's or women's finals from french open. i have walked by the roland garros stade in paris- on the way to jardin bagatelle- and i am fascinated by the game.  of course, mean mamma has neither the talent nor the fitness, nor the eye-hand coordination to play the game, but she has always enjoyed watching others play the game. those williams sisters are astounding athletes- though i would have liked to see j. capriati win another grand slam event. i was on my way to frankfort while that match was being played, and i was at church while the men's final was played.    the other sporting events are either of no interest whatsoever (nab,stanley cup, tyson) or unaccessible (world cup) due to lack of cable tv. one of mamma's true meannesses is her determination to not have cable tv. she feels that having cable just encourages people to watch tv- lots of mindless television watching- and she doesn't feel that she needs to pay for such a mindless pursuit.  this week, she will celebrate 21 years of cable-free marriage, by the way.  those offspring who feel the need to watch cable programs, of course, can walk up the street to grandma's house, where satelite programming is available, and probably utilized 24/7.  yea,yea,yea, so i have never watched sex in the city, or 6 feet under, but i have read a lot of books lately.......

      ok, so i recieved a funny story about a celeb sighting from mommy's friend beth (not to be confused with mommy's friend jane....) who lives in san francisco- i have deftly cut and pasted it below.....  On an odd note--I had dinner with Elvis Costello and Wavy Gravy a few weeks ago.  Well-- they were at the next table and I failed to recognize them until they were leaving and to top that I recognized Wavy Gravy and missed the entire Elvis Costello opportunity.  It would have been fun to have paid attention.  I was deeply engrossed in conversation with my Mom friends about the long showers our sons take.  Perhaps they were listening to the Moms at the next table! Somehow I doubt it.  But worth a chuckle. > ok, so i have never heard of wavy gravy, and had to ask my children. i have heard of elvis costello- my friend rachel really likes that elvis, but she is in italy right now and cannot fully appreciate this 2nd or 3rd degree of separation to elvis thanks to mommy's friend beth.

      ok, so mean mamma has to clean her house this weekend!!! i have invited a dietetic intern from vanderbilt to visit the restaurant for 2 days next week- and also invited her to stay with us. she read about me in the eleusis, the alumnae magazine of chi omega sorority- and called me up one day. she is from austin, texas, and sounds very blond on the phone. she wants to have her own restaurant one day, maybe i can talk her out of it........  i am leving shortly for work- we are catering at the ky herb society festival in frankfort, with a lovely box lunch that includes mediterrean chicken in a vegetable-stuffed pita, minted fruit, and a lavender lemon bar. i hope i have enough stuff to make 200 box lunches, but i may not have enough fruit to go round, when we run out we come home, so either way is fine with me.....

      ok, so i am enjoying the letter-to-the-editor debate over the ten commandments and the bible vs. the state.  the letter yesterday from a guy from harrodsburg was pretty good (not as good as rachel's but right up there). he pointed out that the woman who wrote the inflammatory letter that started the debate was completely clueless about the origins of the pilgrims, the us consitution, etc.  neither the ten commandments nor the bible is mentioned in any way in the constitution- and the first ammendment clearly states that the us government cannot force religion upon its citizens-  this woman, and many like her, wish to force their religion on us.  speaking as a christian, i am personally offended when other 'christians' seem to think that God speaks only to them, and that somehow they and their take on God's message is the only way that it can be understood. this country was built on religious freedom- and that means freedom from having to deal with the religion of others in public places like schools, courthouses, etc.  the irony of it all is- if prayer was allowed in school, it would have to rotate between all of the religions represented in america- protestant, jew, catholic, greek orthodox,  hindi, islam, native american, buddhist. etc.  i would get of kick out of seeing the religious fanatics having to deal with a moment of zen meditation on every third thursday when the zen buddhists had their turn.........

      ok, so mean mamma dislikes being portrayed as mean unfairly.  last night, cayle ate supper with the neighbors, as they were going to take her to swim practice with their daughter, and i was supposed to pick them both up and bring them home afterwards.  plans changed when i realized that i would have to go into town anyway (to drop off stephan), so i offered to take them to practice and the neighbor would pick them up.  on the way to town, cayle told stephan about all she had eaten for supper- mac and cheese, green beans, apples, carrots, etc- later that evening, when ernst got home from biking, he asked cayle what she had eaten for supper. she told him that i had refused to feed her supper.  thankfully stephan reminded her that she had already eaten supper with the neighbors, and that it was mean to lie to try to get a second meal.  cayle contended that she had only had a little snack........that girl would eat 24/7 if allowed to do so

      ok, so i forgot to watch bachelorettes in alaska. i don't remeber if i watched anything instead, or simply didn't watch tv at all that day- but i missed the landmark event- the bottom to which tv has sunk thusfar. i cannot think of alaska's rugged male popluation without thinking about the oldest son in Malcom in the Middle and his miserable experience in alaska working in a logging camp.  malcom is a breath of fresh air to otherwise stale sitcoms- just outrageous enough to be funny week after week, but not so much that i cannot believe that it could happen in real life.  so in malcom's alaska scenario, the rugged males in alaska tend to be losers from the bottom 48- these men may be desparate for female companionship, but that doesn't mean that they are worth the effort to snare one.  do they vote them out of the state, or am i confusing this silly show with another similalry vapid production on another channel?

      on the blogger home page, there was a blurb aimed at a select crowd of bloggers- if you blog in nyc, put yourself on our map.  does this mean that you would plot in your exact location, say at the corner of 33rd and vine (surely not real nyc city streets) would armed paratroupers arrive when govt censors become animosed when the content starts to resemble ozzy osborne's home life.  or is so bloggers can reach out and touch somebody's hand, and make this world a better place, if we can........either way, i like the anonymity of the blog format, and will not plot my global location, thank you very much.

      ok, so i really am just mean. today we didn't get a danville sunday paper (it is 6/2/02 and i proably failed to pay for the subscription to be extended past may.......) so i got dressed and walked up to my mother's mailbox and 'borrowed' her paper.  she doesn't read it until after church, and she will be coming down here for lunch- doesn't that justfiy petty larceny? i hate to go to church without reading the paper- i feel so out of touch.  this morning was perfect for paper-reading- dry, quite warm, with a freshly scented wisp of a breeze. none of your blow-away-the-paper- breezes, mind you.  my sunday paper reading is always alone- as ernst rides his bike with friends on sundays and none of the children get up this early.......

      ok, so i was piqued by the letter to the editor section of the paper yesterday, both with the quasichristian letter (quasi because she is quite ill-informed about her church history and it is her duty as a christian to become informed.....)and for the letter about the alzheimer's patient arrested in savealot for eating a 50 cent candy bar. i shop at savealot for the restaurant for such sundries as oyster crackers and canned kidney beans.  it is close to the restaurant when we run out of homemade bread during lunch.  the manager is always very nice to me, as are some of the checkout clerks. however, there are also some checkout clerks who haven't got 'a lick of sense'. the store manager is off on thursdays- i can only hope that this incident happened on her day off, and that one of the nitwits was responsible. it is also possible that the store has a black and white policy on shoplifting- with no clause for mitigating circumstances like senility.  the idea of shopping there leaves a bad taste in my mouth- but i would hate to see that store close because it is the only grocery left in danville that is within walking distance to people like those who live in the apartment building next to trc, or walnut street apartments, etc.  i would not be surprised if savelot is boycotted by those who know this woman, or know of this incident.  either way, there will be no happy ending.

      ok, so tonight i sat through 3.5 hours of swimming banquet festivities- fromstanding in line for over 20 minutes while we waited for the fried chicken strips to arrive from the walmart- through mini-bios of all 100 swimmers on the team to 110% awards for each age castegory- you get the picture- speaking of pictures- it was dark by the time they tried to take a group picture of all the special award winners.  then i came home to discover that someone had drank the last of my last bottle of wine. gentle readers, never drink the last of mean mamma's wine after mean mamma has been thinking about a glass of wine during a 3.5 hour swim meet...........

      ok, so my book club met last night and organized itself. while this might not be fast-breaking news, it does make life easier. we have decided upon 6 books, and 6 meeting dates and 6 meeting places- all in advance so we can make read ahead as needed.  i have traditionally hosted the meeting at the end of february (icall it my birthday book club) and serve a meal that goes along with the book.  i chose jane austin's persuasion, because we have never read austin and it is relatively short. there were those who grumbled that this book was not voted upon, and that it was probably a squishy hormone book- austin is all about social satire, not hormones, which this group will certainly discover upon closer inspection.  ah well. i do hope that lapsed and sorely missed book club members will read this book and plan on coming on wednesday february 26 at 7:00............

      ok, so suffered through the most boring supper last night- some of my parents dearest friends (from texas) came by for a few days on an extended trip to visit family and friends in the east.  they are ex-military(the husband graduated west point). i am unused to so many republicans in one place, especially now that my brother does not visit often.  i did get out of hand when they were all tralking about geneology, and i mentioned my newly discovered but shameful kinship to gwbush.  this crowd was not amused.........neither was i amused at the 30+ minute story about local united way scandals in their hometown and how black-run charities couldn't figure out how to manage their finances, and then another 30+ minutes trying to make sure that i understood that they are not bigots.  ah well, it was nice of them to come for a few days and cheer up my mother......

      ok, so i finished the chair by the time that mr. bingley proposed to jane bennett, and was able to casually watch the rest of P&P with a glass of wine while gazing smugly at the newly covered chair. well, not too smugly, as any fool can tell that it was not done by a professional. but it is done, and i can move on.  and i can put back the P&P tapes for another project......  i also watched the end of the tour de france.  the end of anti-climactic- like we didn't know that lance was going to win again. when you are that far ahead, it takes a fluke to lose.  he really won last week when heras paced him up the mountain in the south of france and lance fought back when belocki tried to attack on the same climb. that was the defining moment- and basically the ride was all downhill from there.  i enjoyed the brief footage from vaux-le-vicomte, a fabulous chateaux in melun, where the tour started on the last leg.  i visited there in 1989 on one of my trips with deedra.  i took the train to melun, then a taxi to the chateaux (a $16 taxi as i recall.....) it was built just before versailles was reborn as a super-chateaux by the finance minister for louis XIV- he of course paid for it with embezzled funds- so louis took it from him after a big open-house party, and through the finance guy in jail- then took all of his work crew (architects, gardeners, etc.) to versailles to work for him. andre le notre did the gardens- just like her did the gardens at versailles and the tuilleries- these  gardens are so french- with series of fountains and parterres and with very little lawn- certainly no lawn to tread upon- just lawn to look upon. the house is quite lovely, with less gold and frou frou and more nice touches like caned chairs.  it is worth a visit if you are ever in the area....

      ok, so this weekend mean mamma is recovering a chair.  this is the second time that this chair has had to be recovered- our precious cat mistakes this chair for a scratching tower. the first time, i paid someone $150 to do the job. the cat had the back in tatters within a year- so i decided to do the second recovering myself since it appeared to be a short-term thing anyway.  the fabric is a soft gold with a rib to it that i got for $1 a yard at the last jackson chair sale- even if i screw up i am out less than $10. i have learned a lot about the process since the last go-around- i took apart the cover, and used each piece as a pattern for the new cover. i also added an inch around each side- the last time it was hard to stretch the thing to cover the bottom of the chair..........i have moved the operation out to the back room because there is more floor space. my goal is to finish before the 6 hours of A&E's pride and predjudice finishes up on the vcr- my family finds my fascination with jane austin humerous. i like to watch such things while doing projects because i don't have to pay really close attention, but i can pay attention if i want to..... i would not attempt to watch say gosford park right now because i would be rewinding odften to figure out what is going on........and what was said.  besides, the more one reads, or watches P&P, the more astute one becomes to austin's satire on the uppety-side of this world. right now, i am struggling to get the parts over the armrests just right.........  if all goes well, i want to recover the loveseat in the front room- there is also an arm chair with a matching footrest that i will pay someone to to because it has lots of wood trim that i wouldn't know how to work around.  of course, i could have paid someone to do all of this, but i am trying to save money for a trip...... now, if only my on-site cat whisperer would tell the kitty to stop with the scratching........

      ok, so mean mamma will not be getting botox anytime soon.  there was an article in the lexherleader about sydney barrows biddle, known in the 80's as the mayflower madame, who now holds botox parties for her friends in a plastic surgeons office. she gets free botox when a certain number of her friends get treatments at $800 a pop.  someone the idea of paying that kind of cash to have botulism spores injected into my body seems wrong and misguided- i recall that in the turn of the century, women took small amounts of arsenic to keep their skin clear and young looking.......... what is next? i cannot even imagine.

      ok, so mean mamma has a thing or two to say about cloning. i heard on the news tonight about a woman in south korea that is pregnant with a cloned embryo.  my first thought was - is it her own clone, or someone elses?'  if it in fact a clone of her own body- than is she giving birth to her daughter, her sister, or herself? will we have to come up with new pronouns for clones- or should that person be introduced as just my 1st second or third clone? if she cloned her husband, is it incestuous to sleep with this child when he grows older?  if she cloned her mother, is she now her own grandmother?  it is too much.  speaking of too much, stephan has informed us that we are, in fact, 21st cousins to g.w.bush through a british connection. he has really gotten into this geneology thing- i told him that i would rather be related to someone like princess diana- she had style and panache and certainly didn't have big ears........

      ok, so we catered a dinner last night, to which attendees brought "their own"  as in byob.  such a motley assortment of bottles when the event was over- wine of course, some drank whiskey mixed with diet coke- but the most intriguing were the wine coolers.  understand that mean mamma is not a fan of overly sweet foods/beverages of any kind- so overly sweet cooler concoctions that mix together cranberry juice with kiwi and white zinfandel sound disgusting- and look worse- like a jonestown cocktail of death.  i think that one wasd called harbor mist or amber mist or something just as banal.  of course, i don't like white zinfandel plain- i find it too sweet.   this crowd was exclusively from out of town- but some things are the same all over- one woman missed most of the festivities because she was constantly out of the dining room on her cell phone- talking to her kids, returning phone messages, telling people to 'look on the table in the back room' over and over like somehow it would be found on the table in the back room if she mentioned it enough.  i am not sure that she actually ate any of the appetizers- which were lovely, by the way. i did a delicious layered marinated vegetable display- in a dill dressing- the marinated mushrooms were wonderful, along with a baked brie.  sometimes food is the better part of my day...........back to the cell phoen addict- at one point she had gone to the bathroom, and her cell phone- in her purse- was rining once again- and someone at her table took it to her- while she was in the bathroom!!!! just to stop it from ringing.  you would think that this woman would have taken the hint and turned it off- just to be sociable.......

      ok, so i do believe that i am related to charlemagne.  i like the idea of being 39 generations removed from the founder of the frankish dynasty.  i also like the idea of being related somehow to lord and lady baltimore- is that the same lady baltimore for whom the cake is named.  i especially like being related to people with foods named after them.

      i enjoyed reading the loyal opposition's review of valmont.  that movie is a remake of sorts of liasons dangerouse (sp) starring john malkovich and glen close as the mean courtesan and michelle pffiefer and uma thurman.  i have seen both, and felt that both movies did a good job at conveying the utter cuthroat culture that was the aristocracy.  however, no one does cuthroat like glen close (think cruella deville........) that liasons role may have gotten her all of the 101 dalmation remakes.  i sought out valmont just to watch colin firth- who i enjoyed in pride and predjudice. he apparantly went on to have a baby with meg tilly who was also in the movie-i did not find her role near as believable as when played by michele pffeifer.  no. colin is not the man of my dreams (bridgit jones diary certainly cured me of that) as i am married to the man of my dreams- however, he has brief moments of handsomeness riddled through out his movies that i find appealing.  speaking of men of my dreams- i am eternally grateful that i didn't grow up in the era of arranged marriages- one would usually find oneself married to an old geezer just because his connection to my family was advantageous to my parents.  of course, i suppose that some women still are willing to marry old rich geezers, but at least it is their choice and they have no one to blame but themselves........  speaking of costume pictures- i regret that i never got around to seeing the importance of being earnest at the ky theatre in its umptennth remake.  this one has the usual cast of characters who do such films- many who were in gosford park as well as reese witherspoon of all people.

      ok, so i thought i was going to get to take cayle to chicago this weekend, but we have taken on a job and she couldn't go anyway because of swim conference.  i am now looking to take a few days during dhs fall break and go to chicago via columbus indiana and back via springfield illinois.  mean mamma is just not happy unless she has a trip of some sort to look forward to.  mean mamma IS glad that she is NOT her sister-in-law lisa. lisa is ernst's youngest sibling- probably 39- she had her first child graduate from high school this year, her youngest child is 2 years old and letting himself out of the front door, her dog just died of leukemia,  her new puppy isn't working out, her middle child has 2-a-day soccer practices,  her husband has been laid off since christmas, and her son that was to go to college in 4 weeks just broke his leg. on top of that she is executrix for ernst's mother's will, and sister elaine does not speak to her because of that fact.  no matter how dismal things may seem in my life, i can conjur up visions of how much worse they could be......of course, mean mamma worries that mamma weber's money is tied up in mutual funds........

      ok, so i am over the wedding and on to other things. we did a breakfast this morning at 6:00, which meant that i had to be there at 5:00 which meant that i had to get up and out the door by 4:45- i heard part of a bbc call-in show about arms control, and then 10 or so minutes of michael j. fox reading from his book lucky man.  now, this is a book that i wouldn't have read, being as it is about disease and recovery and certainly a tearjerker with all sorts of too intimate details about the treatment, etc.  not my sort of book at all- BUT, the few minutes i heard were quite compelling, especially because it sounded like michael was telling me and me alone all about his troubles at 4:49 am.  i can barely thinks about to his first sit-com and i only saw the first back to the future and i may never have watched spin city- so i am not the best of mjfox fans.  BUT if the library has this book on tape i may listen to it to see what happens after the part where i got to work and turned off the car.......

      ok, so my partner and i did a wedding in winchester yesterday for 65 people, and i am still getting over it.  the house was one of those 8,000 square foot jobs, on a huge lot that seemed to have a field in front and back. i was therefore surprised that this couple had notbothered to actually weed their foundation plantings, nor mulch around them- there were 3 foot tall thistles and all sorts of healthy and large crab grass and other assorted pesky plants.  there were 2 middleschool age boys living there-one would think that they could have handled the big weeds without worrying that they would mess up the yard.......when we took the job, we offered to bring along  staff people to bus tables, and serve drinks-but no- they had a 'housekeeper' who would be taking care of those details. the bride herself had bought all of the beer, wine, soft drinks, etc, and the housekeeper would keep them all set out on a self-serve bar.  ha-we were already in the upstairs kitchen working on benedectine finger sandwiches when this little woman arrives and introduced herself to the bride- apparantly she cleans the house everyother week during the day when groom( who lived here before the wedding) was at work, and had never met the bride.  turns out that she didn't know many things about the house- like where the temperature controls were located- so when the cake with white chocolate icing(from some lex baker, not us) started to sweat from the heat- we couln't turn down the airconditioning.......the icing started to literally melt off of this cake..........anyway, the housekeeper had no instinct of any kind on what one did during a party- she seemed to think that she was there to clean up after it was all over. think back to gone with the wind- the maid played by butterfly mcqueen- 'i don't know nothing about serving parties, miss scarlet........' that was the modern version of this housekeeper.   we found her sitting on one of our coolers in the pantry at one point and she admitted that she was hiding out from the evil wedding coordinator and her equally evil mother the florist. that we could understand because we tried to avoid them as well.  these women were like charicitures of their roles- if i hadn't been on the job i would have laughed at the black comedy of it all.  they had this little habit of coming up to jerry or me and saying stuff like 'someone needs to start picking up plates....'  jerry answered with what became out standard reply to these women- 'you had better find the housekeeper.....'  someone needs to make sure that the guests don't take the pop cans to their tables'  someone needs to get more cokes'  someone needs to make sure the dog doesn't get out of the pantry. someone needs to move this coffee table out of the way. someone needs to move that sofa. someone needs to cut the cake(it wasn't our cake, and the bride had not mentioned cutting the cake but jerry did it anyway)  someone needs to clean out this sink......at this point i almost turned and smacked this woman- as i was washing out our serving pieces in that sink- and i wasn't going to clean out that sink until i was finished.  she almost accused us of taking some of her leftover flowers 'someone has stolen our freesias....' she exclaimed as she came out of the pantry- followed by her little assitant with the freesias in her hand saying- 'they were right there in the sink....'  jerry and the evil florist got into it when the florist tried to put a hurricane candle arrangement under an airconditioning vent- even though the candle was in glass the forced air kept putting it out...... the food went over well.  we only hope that the guests do not blame us for the quality of champagne offered at the toast-which couldn't have cost over $3 a bottle. i guess when you live in a house that had to have cost $350,000, you can't afford someone to weed or decent wine.......one more interesting note from the days events- we passed a stretch suburban- like a limosine only with a large suv- it was really strange- we couldn't figure out why someone would bother- like making a stretch vw beetle........what's the point......

      ok, so mean mamma wants not only to have a second home in france, but to have one in the pyrennees- the tour de france scenery yesterday was spectacular. apparantly lance himself has a second home on the other side of the mountain they climbed- on the spanish side, though. i have enough problems with french- i don't think i could tackle spanish, too.  anyway, back to my dream house- it would have espaliered fruit trees, and a trout stream, and be close enough to a village so that i could walk into town for cheese and bread and wine.  well, i would surely have a wine cellar, now wouldn't i?  therefore, i would have to drive to bordeaux and buy in bulk just so i would always be prepared.......oh, yeh, and chablis and sancerre as well.....of course, invite my friends to spend their vacations in my fantasy house, and rent it out when no one else was using it.  the mountains don't seem like a place for a pool, but a hot tub sounds just wonderful......

      ok, so yesterday i watched the tape of crouching tiger/hidden dragon that andrew brought home from the library.  i found it to be a visual pleasing movie, as i would expect from the director of one of my favorite jane austin films- sense and sensibility. of course with jane austin. ang lee couldn't mess around with the ending- austin fans would rebel if lee had changed the happy conclusion to something like emma thompson jumping off a bridge rather than marrying hugh grant.  i didn't see that coming, though i did not that the male lead would be killed by the jade fox because andrew accidently let that slip at dinner........i was surprised to see such a non-glamourous role for a movie antogonist- the jade fox was mean even for mean mamma standards.....obviously i would have preferred jen to go off in the sunset with lo, and michelle yeoh to find happiness with the guy whose name i cannot remember.  i did like his haircut- of course, i was impressed by the fight scenes- i liked the scene in the pub where jen clears them all out one by one.  a true ninja babe........

      ok, so i cheated for the second day in a row- i looked up the tour results, but now i can't wait to see the video because i want to see how lance pulled off a stage win and the maillot jaune all in the same race.and how another postal rider is now third in the tour.    july is fading fast and i haven't gone anywhere this summer. it doesn't look like i will go anywhere at all this summer.  of course, one could say that going on a big trip in january already i shouldn;t whine about not going anywhere 6 months later- but then mean mammas have to have something to whine about........

      ok, so i have cheated and i already feel guilty about it. i am really tired, and i don't want to stay up and watch the taped version of the tour de france tonight- so i looked up on line who won and where lance is now placed.  i know, i know, it's kind of like looking up on line who won a wimbledon tennis match rather than watch the delayed televised broadcast.  but then. sleep sounded so good, better than watching lance on the last flat section before the mountains. at least he didn't wreck or anything like that.......

      ok, so i ate like a pig at the food show- and i am quite embarassed at the things i tasted- there must be some latent fried food gene deep within my body that wants fried foods when presented with them in heated displays- fried mushrooms. fried cauliflower, fried zucchini, fried cheese, french fries in assorted shapes and seasonings....it just went on and on. i did have a plum off of the fruits and vegetables display.....we got there early and left early- and missed the party with the free drinks that my workmates were looking forward to, but we were all stuffed and tired, and so drove back to danville. on the way back, we made up stories about people in the cars that passed us- like 'she is behind on her car payments and her boyfriend is in jail' i stuff like that. there were several very funny stories but i can't recall them because i was driving.  last night we looked at the pile of photos that ernst had developed over the weekend- when he announced that he was going to develop pictures from thebike trip- all sorts of undeveloped film canisters came forth from drawers and other hiding spots- we had pictures from las vegas- a trip at least 3 years ago, from dc/philly with 8th grade, which included a really cute wide angle photo of petra and one of betty, also pictures of stephan in the hospital in iowa when he got dehydrated during the bike trip there, also christmas pictures from 2 years ago while my dad was still living across the street and able to open presents.  there were pictures from heidlburg and amsterdam.  many good pictures that didn't get developed for whatever reason.....

      ok, so mean mamma didn't get around to blogging yesterday- but not because of a lackof material........i went shopping on sunday with andrew and stephan in lexington-none of us bought much. when we got back home there were 2 fully loaded tourist bikes on the porch- and that meant only one thing-ernst had fixed one or two tourist bikes, and then invited them home.  our 2 tourists were quite a surprise- a father and son team from a small town between haarlem and amsterdam, near the airport.  the son was about 36, and works as a forensic auditor for a large corporation- he finds money launderers and tax evaders, etc through both computer and traditional research methods.  in holland, the work week is technically 36 hours, so employees are paid for 36 hours regardless of how many hours are actually worked.  he takes off the unpaid work time at the end of major projects- this biking trip is 45 days long because that is how much unpaid time he worked.  his father is a carpenter. they both spoke english very well, not surprising as they have cycled throughout america on numerous occassions- and have seen more states and parks and sights than most americans.  they did seem a bit conservative- neither drank beer, and they did get a bit worked up when i asked about Holland's liberality of laws regarding euthanasia, marijuana use, gay marriage, etc.  one could gather that they didn't approve of such laws...anyway, they were both surprised to hear that 3 of us had recently been to holland, and readily commiserated about the lack of parking, the traffic,etc.  they had supper with us, spend the night in the guest room. in the morning, stephan and ernst rode with them to harrdosburg to make sure they got on the right road to bardstown.  their visit was a nice diversion.  of course, now i want to go back to holland.....  today the restaurant is closed, and the entire staff is going to a food show in covington.  food shows are free-for-alls- the warehouse that we buy from invites all of its suppliers to being samples of foods it makes, and we get to taste them all. at the end of the day, attendees are allowed to grab what they want, so the suppliers do not have to lug everything back to their vehicles.  in the past i have come home with nice jars of capers, anchovies, olives, artichoke hearts, fresh apricots, exotic mushrooms, and other neat foods. there is a party after the show closes, with free drinks. in the past my crew has been really into mixed drinks like gin and tonic or whiskey and diet coke. i am not into such fare. so i am the designated driver. my van is the only vehicle among us big enough to take everyone up to cincinnati- as long as i have my free fresh apricots i am just fine and dandy........

      ok, so it is july, and my family spends each and every evening watching a taped segment of the tour de france. my mother's vcr is much newer than ours, so it looks very garbled on our machine.  however, the portable tv/vcr combo handles the tape just fine, so  we watch the tour tapes on a 9 inch screen. seems very americana for a family of 5 to be gathered around a 9-inch screen- kind of like radio days. last night the german sprinter erik zahbel (sp) finished 1/3 of a tire before 2 other riders- he retains the green jersey (for sprinting) but doesn't win the yellow jersey for overall leader because that is based on total time- today everyone finished about the same time.  lance armstrong remains in 3rd place- he won't make his move til the mountains, where he can pull ahead with less risk of wrecking. sprints are prone to wrecks because everyones wheels are so close together.  a bike wreck in a sprint with 20-30 riders starts off the domino effect..........anyway, today they ride in normandy- it will be relatively flat.  they will come around the wetsern parts of france before taking on the pyrenees and then the alps. lance always bides his time until the mountains.   i got to sleep in til 8:00 this morning and do not have to go to work until about 2:00- we are doing a wedding starting at about 6- i have to put together some vegetable baskets, stuff 200 little buns with roast beef, make bean dip and artichoke dip, and barbeque 250 meatballs. surely i can do that in 4 hours. no alcohol will be served, so this event will not last forever.......when beer or wine is served, the guests tend to stay until it is gone........

      ok, so i found a white hair amongst my otherwise brown hairs on my head this morning- and i am freaked out.  this hair was white- not even grey- and while i only saw the one there may be others lurking nearby.....i should feel fortunate to be 46 and to have had so few encounters with fading coloration (i found a grey hair a few years ago- but it must have been a mutant because that seemed to be the end of it, or so i thought....) i do not want to have to color my hair- i so dislike the thought of having that telltale skunk stripe down the middle of my head when the hair starts to grow out and the grey/white roots show...  i am still bummed out about a child i encountered as part of one of my freelance nutrition consulting ventures.  this child is 9 years old and has lost 15 pounds in the past 2 months.  he told me without blinking that he doesn't eat because he wants to die- the grave is the only place for him since his mother doesn't want him, nobody wants him.  it is sad to think that in this land of plenty there are children who have so little- so little love and attention, so little cause for joy.  that's a picture that i can't get out of my mind. ..it puts my fretting over a white hair in perspective.

      ok, so i read this morning in lexherleader about centre's columbarium, by old centre, where for a fee centre grads may pay to have their ashes spend eternity.  no mention of centre's price- but u of richmond charges $3000 while u of va charges only $1800. article also vague on whether non-centre grads can pay to be interred in this location- whether pubically educated ashes may lay near centre educated remains.  OR whether dogs of centre grads may be interred, regardless of where their degree was earned.......maybe a tiered approach could be lucrative for centre:  for an extra $1000 we will have an eternal flame burning in front of your remains (for an extra $500 we will simply make it glow......)  for an extra $10,000 we will allow for your mistress to be interred with you, and we promise that your wife will never know.....  for an extra $100,000 we will posthumously award a bfa to your spouse and/or mistress or to whoever is interred with you....  for an extra $1,000,000 the board of trustees will hold a candlelight vigil by your remains on the anniversary of your death, every year, even in the rain or snow.......  just a few suggestions......   enough of this- lets talk about the many frightful glamour don'ts seen in danville yesterday- one woman in particular strands out- literally. she was getting into a minivan at dq- a very large woman wearing a neon tie-dyed mu-mu of sorts- tie-dye done to that large a garment ends up looking like a bulls-eye. that woman could have been targeted from space........of course, if she is a centre grad, there may be a 6 x 6 inch box waiting for her near old centre.......

      ok, so i am upset about time magazine's reporting of julia robert's marriage to her cameraman. time made much light of it, and hoped her much happiness for as long as it lasts.  i am saddened that time would publically comment on such things as marital happiness. i believe that anyone who opts to tie the knot has at least a 50/50 shot at being married forever. and who is to say that a famous wife cannot find marital bliss with a nonfamous person- or that a famous person can only be content with someone with equal billing on the marquee.  so her marriage to lyle lovett didn't last, so what.  so she ran out on her marriage to kiefer sutherland right before the wedding, so what.  my in-laws were married for over 50 years, and argued almost every day- is that happiness or just the desire to finish what you started? in fact, my parents and both sets of grandparents and at least 1 set of greatgrandparents were married over  50 years- and that doesn't prove the happiness question. i only like to think that they were happy years spent together on the mutual project of raising children, keeping a house and property in decent repair, working, and having a bit of enjoyable spare time on the side.  i like to think that i will be off somewhere with ernst on our 50th wedding anniversary- maybe biking in france (between small inns with great wine and fabulous food)- it takes a lot of work to stay married. julia might just have found the only person worth putting in the time and effort to stay married. lets give her the benefit of the doubt.  woody allen once said ( or therabouts) 80% of life is just showing up.......so far. julis is right on target.

      ok, so i sat for 3 hours last night and watched the horse whisperer.  for the uninformed, this is a movie produced by, directed by, and starring robert redford- he probably did his own stunts, did his own makeup, and fed his own horse as well.  i felt the most compassion for the poor horse, who has been traumatized both physically and emotionally-redford is the rugged outdoorsy rancher who knows how to heal him. the camera just loves redford in this movie, the camera always loves him in any movie that he has been in. i may have to locate 3 days of the condor- a lesser known redford thriller, or find some of the most popular ones like the sting and butch cassidy or the great gatsby or the way we were...i can't watch the way we were without sobbing at the end.  ah well, maybe there will be horse whisperer II- or the cat whisperer followed by the dog whisperer as lucrative sequels.  stephan is our resident cat whisperer, maybe we have an indie flick on our hands..........

      ok, so i felt sorry for nalvandian, the guy who got whooped in the men's final at wimbledon yestderday, he lost in straight sets, and won only 6 games out of the entire match.  he had played much better tennis in the semifinal game against the equadorian player. maybe he was just tired and nervous by the time sunday rolled around.  i only watched a few minutes of doubles- it is such a brutal version, with each player trying to smash the ball out of the court in a way that can't be returned.  so now we have the us open to look forward to, then no more tennis til next year....

      ok, so it took a committee to finish our fishpond.  at one point, ernst, stephan and andrew were out standing in the water debating on how to elevate the sides to hold more water.  it is lovely as it is rightnow- i am no longer concerned about the what ifs- only the nows and the what could be's regarding landscaping.........it is twice as big as version #3and 4.......

      ok, so mean mamma is very slow at the uptake when it comes to humor. yesterday stephan and i launched into our fourth remake of our fishpond.  we dismantled everything, down through all 3 liners, including the original one that i installed after going to the chelsea flower show and deciding that i could not live without a water feature in my yard.  the liner i bought was small, which basically dictated that size and shape of my pond.  the liner that we bought yesterday was 12 x 12- stephan and i continue to enlarge the pond based on the generous size of said liner- we have acheived roundness and may reach oval status as we dig closer to the fence line.  stephan also had the bright idea to move the waterfall around to the side so it can be seen from the deck- did i tell you that my son is brilliant? anyway, back to the humor.  when ernst got home from work, stephan's first words to him were "do you want to bring out the level?' it is so funny now- the next morning- in that when stephan and i launched into our brickwalk around the flowerbeds project- ernst kept trying to get us to use the level to make sure that the walks would be even.  we soon abandoned use of said level, because we were building on a hill anyway, and very few sections could be level anyway.  i don't think ernst caught on that stephan was actually making a joke out of the level- i certainly didn't catch on.........anyway- the fourth version of the lily pond is going to be tremendous......i certainly hope that we will not require version number 5...........

      ok, so i am blogging while i wait for wimbledon tennis ladies finals to come on.  while i lack the eye-hand coordination requires to play tennis (or most games, for that matter.....) i enjoy watching.  wimbledon is a bittersweet time for me- i recall clearly that chris evert was taking her final bow on the tv in the recovery room while i was coming out of anesthesia after surgury for an ectopic pregnancy. this was in 1989, i believe- i don't think about this event much, other than it dominoed into my travel habit.  i was off work for 6 weeks owing to the abdominal incision- and i got really depressed sitting around the house every day. a good friend suggested that we drive up to cincinnati to see the taft museum- we had such a good time that we decided that we might as well go to paris on our next trip. she and i ended up going 4 times total (to be fair the 4th trip was free using ffmiles). travel has always seemed to be a better investment in my mental health than counseling......... but i digress- back to wimbledon.  i started watching wimbledon because chris evert always played either in the semis ro the finals when i was growing up.  she was my age, so i was fascinated by her talent at an age when i seemed to lack any talent.  i would love to attend the tournament in person one day. i have seen the complex from the train, on our way to hampton court several years ago. ( i actually walked by roland garros in paris on my way to jardin de bagatelle- the most beautiful rose garden in the world, by the way....) all this talk of paris and wimbledon reminds me that i really want to go somewhere in january. i am saving every penny in hopes that some desparate airline will want to sell me a few cutrate tickets to somwhere i want to go........of course, i want to go everywhere........

      ok,so i was mean last night at the block party we were invited to out on the newer part of bluegrass estates- the embattled part of bluegrass estates.....i inoocently asked the man eating next to me at the potluck pre-fireworks supper if this was the neighborhood that wanted to send it children to boyle instead of danville.  oh, yes, he said- it makes no sense to send our children to danville when we are right across the street from the boyle schools.  he added that he didn't sign the petition until 80% of his neighbors had also signed. and that his children were grandfathered in because they already attended boyle.  and that he was confident that boyle was the better district...not that anything was actually wrong with danville, but that his children were getting a fine education at boyle.  i mentioned that the dhs class of 2002 was sending 95% of its graduates to college/tech schools, and asked about boyle's track record.  he wasn't sure of actual numbers, but he was sure that the % had caught up to dhs in the past few years.  which means he knew that boyle traditionally has a poor % of children going to college- at the time we decided to send ours from montessori to danville, there was at least a 20% differential in the % going to college between the districts- a substantial difference.  the gentleman in question does plan to vote yes on the wet/dry issue, so he can't be all bad......  but enough of all that- i did enjoy the fireworks, and the international cuisine of the potluck- several familes are either from china or japan- so i enjoyed wonderful soy-basted salmon, sushi, and a delectable tofu/noodle/vegetable dish.  yum yum.

      ok, so the quad bike family from maine story thickens.  the dad got a 5 month leave of absence from his job, so this family has 2  more months together on the bike before they go home.  they planned for this trip of a lifetime so well that they have no debt and has plenty of money saved- they are staying in hotels when the weather gets too oppressive, and when the kids needs to play in a pool.  the father told ernst that the riding has not been as difficult as the 'team dynamics'- 4 people together for that long HAS been difficult- when the team can't stand to be that close for another day- they stop riding for a couple of days and do other things.    today is july 4th- i celebrated my independence from work today by sleeping in til 9:00.  i have neglected my garden to the point that the weeds are big enough to have names of their own if they are allowed to stick around much longer. i believe that i might just get dressed and do a little yard work. especially now that we will soon have new neighbors.  the house on the corner, next to my mom has been sold to a family with 3 sons.  this house has never actually been lived in before- the couple who built it did so on spec- we were surprised that the house sold with the big clods of dirt that surround the house rather than any sort of foundation planting or grass-seeding.  i hope that these children are somwhat near in age to cayle- the only other child living near us is an immature 7.  i grew up in a neighborhood full of children- my parents had to call me in every summer night well after dark-no one wanted to stop playing because everyone had so much fun together.  when andrew and stephan were small there were only retirees on the circle.  they weren't even any fun for ernst and me.........

      ok, so my menfolk are back in town- i arrived at the dart swim meet, and ernst was already there- looking for me- mom and stephan had left him and gone on to the house. stephan looks taller to me, but that may be just because i haven't seen him in almost 2 weeks.    how about those texas floods?  i hope that the loyal opposition takes her life jacket just in case.  i thought of the loyal opposition today when i heard an npr review of a group called the doves.they seemed to have a nice new edge.  of course, i am slow on the uptake about new edge- i have just been informed that i actually have heard the strokes while we were in europe...........ah well, the doves sound like a cross between radiohead and U-2- very rythymic and with interesting lyrics.  i came across an old vanity fair magazine recently that focused on hip music talent in america- i learned that ani difranco left home at 15 to start her singing and recording career in earnest.  on one hand i am impressed, on the other, i thought of how hurt and upset her mother was..............the music i have heard in my mind this week ia the ramones 'i wanna be sedated'.......it could be worse, i suppose. it could be the captain and tenille......

      ok, so i would have to add the following to my list of assumptions that must be fulfilled before i would submit to 3 months on the road with family or friends or absolute strangers for that matter.....  1. private/free time daily- for sightseeing, shopping etc-  2. opt-out privledges- anybody who doesn't want to go certain places can stay at the hotel; this includes the driver.......  3. extended stays in each main town- so reduce the packing and repacking of luggage,  etc.  ok, so i know that this 3 month thing will likely never happen. but a girl can't be too careful, now can she?  ernst, stephan and mom will be back late today. they were approaching kansas city mo, when i phoned them yesterday evening.  after i called them on the cell, my brother called on the house phone. for the record, he probably hasn't called since i began this blog. he has not been for a visit for 2 years.  he announced that he is coming 'home' for a visit with us for r&r- and will probably stir things up by suggesting to our mother that she give up her car keys.  i am not so sure that the time has come for that move- i would be happy if she turns off the books on tape to reduce her distractions. during this conversation with my brother i was again struck by how different we are- he spoke of the necessity for 'military solutions' that involve 'action now and explain later'- and basically blames democrats who are concerned about political correctness for all of the world's problems.  buckle up, this visit is going to be a bumpy ride.....

      ok, so i need to clarilfy all of my statements about not wanting to be on the road with my family for three months. i meant on a bike- i believe i could handle 3 months driving around the continent especially if the british isles were tacked on for good measure, and we were staying in hotels instead of camping, and it was not 18 degrees outside, and the car was big enough, and someone who understands these things put in the gasoline each time..........

      ok, so ernst and stephan have only 46 miles left to ride. they should finish up by about 1:00, then start driving with my mom back to ky.  the temp is now about 100, with wind coming from the east. ernst says it is like riding into a blast furnace.  he has had good experiences, though. he and stephan met a family of 4, who have been on the road for 3 months.  they are riding a quad(bike built for 4) that pulls a little trailer for their gear. the children are about 8 and 9, and are being  home schooled.  from now on, when things look rough and i start to get depressed, i will rejoice that i have not been on the road for 3 months, and that i am not riding a quad bike with my husband and 2 children 24/7- in the 100 degree heat.........

      ok, so i listened to the most thought provoking 45 minutes of radio on my way back from lex this evening- studio 360 on wuky. the first guest was annie drehan(sp) the wife of the late carl sagan who has an entertainment company that specializes in space. she worked on a music project 20 years ago when voyageur went up- she put together a recording to 27 pieces that best defined the world music scene- along with images of man and woman that were physically neutral rather than 'correct'. congress at the time told her that if she included full frontal it would not be sent- 'congress will not fund the sending of smut into space........' 20 years later, an artist named joe davis, who has gotten himself hooked up with MIT is working on a project to correct the omissions- called poetica vagina. he has digitally recorded vaginal contractions, and linked them to the 45 or so sounds in the english language, and is transmitting these vaginal poems into space..........he is also working on an e-coli transmission project. each space flight discards solid waste, containing e-coli,  into the great void, and aliens may encounter mankind by its refuse. joe davis is simply transmitting the e-coli genetic code into space in case aliens are out there searching for us through our intestinal bacteria.........this guy is either quite brilliant or quite mad.....  on the other hand, i offered my youngest child a piece of this delicious watermelon as a treat before bed- sent her out the deck with a wedge and told her to throw the rind into the compost pile when she was done- she came right back in, confused as to how one eats watermelon without a spoon.......somehow life's simple pleasures are lost on those whop lack the instinct to put the face directly to the food.......  lastly, speaking of red hair, i have a box of auburn rinse that i almost put in my hair before i went to europe last winter.  maybe next time.........i can see myself as an upity redhead.......

      ok, so andrew came home today, and brought with him a copy of amelie on dvd that belongs to his new roommate. i really like this guy, sight unseen, because i so enjoyed the movie- in french with english subtitles- i absolutley loved the quirky plot, and the unexpectedness of it all.  of course, i want to go to montmartre and try to find every liitle nook and cranny filmed- i especially found humor in the scene where nino is helping the assistant price 'merchandise' in the peep show store,,,,,i laughed so hard my children were somewhat embarassed.........alas, without the subtitles i would have understood few of the many priceless moments.....i will be buying a copy soon........

      ok, so mean mamma has never actually heard an eminem vocalization- i feel very tipper gore-like in saying that i have no interest in what he has to say just because i think he might be offensive.   i just read the newspaper account of the mtv awards- pish=-posh, i say to all that- the only artist who won anything that i would actually BUY is the white stripes, because i heard about them on npr and they sounded quite eclectic- ok so stephan says that i am being quite rude for not liking something i have not heard- not rude- just mean........get it right- ok?

      ok, so i am marching through my new collection of john grisham novels- each seem to be about 1 or more brilliant lawyers- usually one. i am now curious which of the many protaganist brilliant lawyers that grisham actually identifies with, or really resembles under the veneer of fiction.  i just read 'the partner' which was somewhat disappointing aside from the fact that the female lawyer had the last laugh. i suppose that even jane austin had a bad day writing about her millieu- i didn't like northanger abbey, for example........but then grisham is no jane austin........

      ok, so i am going through loyal opposition withdrawal, now that her site has been inaccessible for several days...i admit it, i like to read the lyrics to songs i would not normally download, i like to read about her cat, and i value her opinions on life in general...come back, little dodo, come back-in your absence i have been forced to read a gardening blog from houston, texas that is not nearly so entertaining............

      ok, as i was driving to work after dropping children off at school, i saw a woman walking with her cat.  the cat was walking right along with her like she had a leash- right on pace- it was a sight to see.  cats just don't do that as a matter of course.  we once had a mother and daughter pair that would 'walk' with us on occassion- around the circle. fluff and tootsie would actually walk with us, rather they would follow us, about 10-15 feet behind, like secret agents on a survelience mission.  it was a hoot...i really miss those cats.  fluff was not the fluffiest of the two- tootsie was bushy and wild looking, but she somehow got the name tootsie when she showed up one day with her 2 kittens. one of the kittens died soon after, leaving us with fluff.  gosh, i miss those cats.

      ok, so mean mamma just wants to say.....thanks...to acw and scw for all of those years that i did not have to monitor your homework progress, worry about spelling words, or math drills, or spend 45 minutes cajoling either one of you to write more than 1 sentence on what labor day means to you that did not come straight out of the dictionary........ tonight, i have spent the last 2 hours working through the spelling word thing- trying to get from 'i already know my words' to 'i don't want to do the words' to 'i will never have to know these words ' to numerous time outs, an almost missed supper, and finally an effeciently spent 10 minutes actually writing down words that mean mamma said aloud (yes, aloud was a word tonight, as well as allowed, as in cayle is not allowed to drive a car....) so frustrating when your daughter cannot be just like your sons....again, guys, thanks so very much........

      ok, so the new gourmet magazine came yesterday, and i sat outside after swimming laps to savor the pictures, articles, and recipes.  alas, many articles about how to use tomatoes, herbs, etc- as i look at my deck plants- a cherry tomato, 2 basils, parsley, chives, oregano, marjarom (sp) and lemon thyme- a glory in being able to pop a cherry tomato or 2 in my mouth daily, and have little hope of ever having enough to actually make a recipe calling for said tomatos.........the aforementioned produce is actually a bumper crop by my standards- still alive by labor day.  i did use some basil and lemon thyme and parsley in a marinated tomato (boughten) salad, with rice vinegar and olive oil- stephan has had multiple helpings........the magazine people will not be by anytime soon...........

      ok, so i enjoyed the npr interview with david bowie this morning - he has a new album out called heathen, which is produced by his ziggy stardust producer.  now ziggy played guitar, and the spiders from mars.............all this was 30 years ago- if that doesn;'t make me feel old, i don't know what does.......david has gone through more transformations than madonna ever thought of- and yet, both he and madonna have children under the age of 2- bowie has to be over 50, with a toddler at home. in his second family, of course, because he has an older child from a previous life who went to and graduated from the college of wooster a few years back- and his presence at graduation caused quite a stir........he spoke of his downer/comptemplative lyrics, and spoke of his lyrics as such rather than poetry set to music.  my favorite bowie song is changes........i wish i had it as a download mp3 file.........

      ok, so i went with mark and mel to see mr. rowland this morning.  we were quite eloquent and restrained, i believe. i really enjoyed mark's comment about coming to see mr rowland rather than ms. johnson- 'if i was really worked up i would have gone straight to the aclu...' i paraphrase but you get the gist........i believe that mr rowland heard our main concerns- the inappropriate use of a single religion in a classroom setting and the possible lack of competence of the teacher to teach the class without use of a textbook, syllabus, etc.  i do feel confident that mr rowland will followup on our concerns.

      ok, so cayle walked part of the way to the bike shop today with peter silver tapley. she described him as the older boy from montessori named peter........he went in the shop with her, got a drink from the fountain and went on home. ernst said he hardly recognized him he had grown so much. when andrew was in preschool, the 5th graders seemed so big, when he was in james' room, the 5th graders still seemed so big, when andrew was in the 5th grade, he seemed so small, and unready to go on to bate.  it is hard to believe that cayle is 2 years out of middle school.   .i had told cayle that we would put up one wall of wallpaper in her new room (stephan's old room) and a border. alas, it has now occured to ernst and i that we putup the shelving over stephan's wallpapered wall- and that taking down said wallpaper may be more than we are prepared to do right now- taking down every single metal track/screw/board.........oh my........this child has her hopes set on a treeline border with a sky background onm the accent wall- which is infinitely better than the wolfpack border she chose originally...because she likes wolves... because she is reading call of the wild in silent reading at school.......ernst decided to try to talk her into liking stephan's old wallpaper......i wish him luck.........

      ok, so i have this new favorite show- for the record, i can only handle watching one or two shows a week on a regular basis, not counting pbs mystery or masterpiece theatre, of course.......but only if the offering is good.......anyway, i enjoy this borrowed abc show called monk- it is about an obsessive-compulsive police consultant who has solved murders two weeks running now. it is a stitch to watch the ocd stuff in addition to figuring out who-dun-it. he straightens stuff, he keeps his laundry in cellophane bags to keep everything fresh, he boils his toothbrushes between uses....that sort of thing. he is everything that i am not. anyway, i enjoy this show, as well as the show alias (also on abc?) which is kind of like the old mission impossible show- only with a young, extremely fit female lead.  i know that i would watch more tv if i got cable, but i have drawn the line on cable, and will not pay the price for the luxury of hundreds of channels that will lure me into watching more television and reading less.

      ok, so andrew was home for supper tonight when i got home from class- eventually he will stay up in lexington because all of his belongings will finally be there instead of here.  he already looks very grown up to me, even from yesterday. there must be a hormonal change that happens when you feel confident and accomplished in doing things for yourself, like buying books getting your internet account lined up.  ah well......

      ok, so i swam laps, came back up to the house after drying off, and got right on the computer........just like i said, i got right on the computer. gentle readers, this phenomena is quite curious- i might take days to get used to the novetly....kind of like people unused to running water who keep turning on the faucet just to see the water running out.  stephan is occupied with moving his stuff into his new room- which is twice the size of his old room, with a double bed and a double sleeper sofa and room for several sleeping bags- it is a veritable party palace compared to his old room and the room he had before that.  alas, we have not yet put up the bookcases to house his personal library- we think it will take at least 7-8 shelves to accomodate his collection- even after he gave up his collection of eyewitness books to his sister.......this family has an obsene(obcene, obscene?) number of books- for which i am unapologetic....which is why our favorite family destination is j.beth and my favorite web site is half.com (i can buy used hardbacks for less than new paperbacks....) i am now rushing through the elizabeth george mysteries, alongside pbs new series of dramatised george mysteries.  the second partof a 2-parter is on tonight, and i do not yet know who-done-it.........many thanks to mona wyatt who suggested that i might like her work- english but not traditionally stodgy or trite.  in the novel i finished last night, one of the murder victims liked to wax her entire body so that there would be no hair whatsoever----quite curious....speaking of england, virgin atlantic has ultra cheap fares to london this fall.....i am not in the mood for london- i would rather go to paris if i must go somewhere.......

      ok, so andrew has an actual dorm room- haggin hall, and an actual roommate- named......andrew.  we are so relieved that this detail has been taken care of.  ernst went up with him to uk today to make sure that everything was all worked out- meal card, room, key, parking pass,  etc,  they drove up together, and then they drove back to danville to drop off ernst, then andrew went back up to uk to get settled in. ok ,so i know that none of this is headline news.........but he is still my boy leaving home to a school that i would not have chosen for him if it had been up to me to decide.  but, should he make the best of it, it may work out just fine.......

      ok, so i picked up the phone this morning and called ms. johnson about my concerns re: world studies.  i told her that i was, of course, concerned about her bias toward christianity, but assumed that she had already spoken to ms bennett about this issue. i told her that i was equally concerned about ms. bennett lack of knowledge on the subject she is teaching, and the concerns that i have about the text books that aren't being used.  ms johnson told me that ms bennett believes the text to be above the heads of the class.........and thus she plans to use them only as reference.  ms johnson already knew that stephan had corrected ms bennet on the king tut pyramid thing (king tut has no pyramid......) and that she had apologized to the class that she was wrong.  of course she has not apologized for the business of noah being the father of all mankind, or the shell fossils on top of mt ararat as proof of the great flood, nor for asking for a show of hands on who was christian.  she may be enthusiastic to teach this class, and the may be the only person available to teach it, but she is clearly in over her head with all but the most basic of students.......

      ok, so i started laughing in church yesterday. the lyrics to the first hymn spoke of jesus being the God of both 'the wise and the simple' the notion of being simple struck me as quite ironic- as simple people tend to not catch on that they are simple(tons)- occassionally they are under the illusion that they are actually clever.

      ok, so i am having food flashbacks from college- there was a deli on my walk home from the home ec building. when i was feeling especially wealthy i would order an onion bagel sandwich- toasted- with turkey, mustard, provolone and mayo. it would be just as good without the turkey- as the onion and provolone flavors are the highlights.  i was thinking of this sandwich as a tried to recreate it with an onion bun, shredded mozzarella, turkey and mayo- ok but not quite as magical as the real thing.    after all of my cleaning yesterday, i filled a box of stuff to sort through and 'file' away. now martha stewart would be proud- because the box is actually a lined basket- but martha would have gone on and finished the sorting job right then and there- my box is sitting on the floor where i will ignore it until i cannot recall what sorts of things are in there and other stuff like clothes for the goodwill will get piled on top.  there are so many things that i cannot throw away- school things belonging to my children- i have every drawing ever made by my children- every piece of their poetry- every craft brought home from camp or school- every ribbon or computer-printed 'certificate' - every trophy. each child has a big plastic lidded tub (or two) filled with stuff. i suspect that the basket is filled with my stuff- i cannot tthrow away stuff like tickets from trips, brochures from places visited- i know in the basket there is a ticket stubb from the art musuem in brussels- now a ticket stub is not much use once one leaves the museum, and i am not going back to brussels any time soon- but i know that i willnot throw away that ticket.  if i had a lick of sense i would go upstairs right now, get that ticket, and tape it inside my travel notebook from that trip- and get  it all over with........of course, that would still leave a basket filled with other stuff.....maybe tomorrow........

      ok, so i am so angry today that i have resorted to terroristic housecleaning to channel this angst lest i do physical damage on my loved ones.  i have cleaned out 3 towel and linen closets, and gone so far as to take at least 3 semi-ratty mattress covers and assorted bedding dating at least to my pre-marriage years to the goodwill.  the peach colored comfortor i could have found a good home for- but today was the day that catharis is key. i took a load of recycling as well, including 2 boxes of old magazines that iloaded up from every cubby hole i could find- even new yorkers- that is how much i needed to find busywork.  i rearranged books on the 'new' shelves in our bedroom- the ones that were supposed to give us leaway in terms of book storage- they are now hopelessly full, with stacks in front of shelved books to the point that one cannot see them.. in all of this semi-rage, i came across a book i had not noticed- called 'a wonderful son' printed on some sort of recycled paper with flowers and seeds imbedded in the fly paper, with poems and drawings and essays- the book was dedicated to 'a wonderful' son from his mother on 1/1/02. (just 3 months before she died.)  of course i had not seen this book, because i was flying to europe on 1/1/02- only ernst went on from the airport into cincinnati- to see his mother.  on this particular day i cannot see past my frustration at my own wonderful son to comtemplate such a tender gift-

      ok, so sara wilson's mom called yesterday to tell me that sara had pledged chi omega sorority. i had written a recommendation for her, and mailed it up to uk just before rush started.  i am truly pleased for her, because she is such a precious girl- has been so since i first met her in montressori preschool oh so many years ago.  she will probably fit right in.  i do not keep up with my chi omega 'sisters' , which is not surprising in that i was once voted the sister least likely to pay a visit.  i am still proud of that.........

      ok, so i should have seen this coming- andrew, at the age of two, once refused the offer of a parental hand while crossing the street- instead he clasped his own hand- saying 'i hold my own hand....' he has been a 'hold-my-own-hand kind of guy all along, so i cannot be too surprised that he left for college with such minimal fanfare- no tearful goodbyes, no hugs, no promises to call...honestly- i wouldn't be surprised if he never really moves back home. he might like the freedom of living on his own so much that he just continues to do so between semesters.  of course, we never said that we wouldn/t change the locks.......

      ok, so my oldest child has left the nest- he packed up his car and drove to lexington to a friend's apt- and we do not know when we will see or hear from him again.  i feel so old and helpless at the same time......a bit more optimistic than barbara bush- at least i need not fear that my boy will somehow devise to destroy the free world..........

      ok, so i dismissed someone today- without a thought. she asked how to get into  the restaurant as i was leaving- i asked her if  i could help- she said she needed to know how to get in so she could fil out an application i said we were not hiring, and so she left, and then i said to myself that we are not hiring women without teeth.  i feel that i am letting down many women- with my personal bias, but i cannot hire women without teeth.  granted, we are not hiring anybody, with or without teeth, but i cannot hire people missing teeth.  there is a point to which i cannot save the world, and it comes when people are missing teeth.  enough said......  i had the interesting sensation yesterday- of meeting up with someone i know- not well- but respectfully- and realizing that she reads my blog.  it was a sensation that races through- very electric- like seeing a ghost i suppose. the immediacy of knowing that someone knows more about you than they would under normal circumstances.  a curious feeling- not in a taudry brittney spears way- but curious nonetheless.......and if she is reading......hello- fellow hyphan....................there are so few of us we should be bonded anyway......

      ok, so ernst and cayle are upstairs in a screaming hysteric, and i am upset, in my blog,  because andrew is leaving sometime today or tomorrow, but will not tell us when- he has also told me that i do not have to come to the parents programs on saturday at uk- i feel like male breasts- so un-needed and dismissed......so many issues so little time---i cannot deal with cayle's issues until i deal with andrew leaving home.......he wants money, of course.................just not my presence..........i may need sedation before this parting is over..........

      ok, so anne williams is my new hero(ine)- she called dhs today to complain about ms bennet and her religious agenda- running the prince of egypt at the 10th grade level is a sign that things have gotten out of hand.....now, if she had invited a muslim to come and speak on islam, and a jew to come and speak about judiaism, i wouldn't be so upset. but her agenda is so narrow.  though i profess to christianity, i take much of it 'with a grain of salt' i do not believe that i, as a woman, sprung from adam's rib- or that noah is the ancestor that connects us all- now that my father- the most devout christian i have ever known is in a hopelessly senile limbo, i even doubt the existence of gods or goddesses- the 'why do bad things happen to good people' thing.  frankly, i would like to have one day, as a parent, without a 'ms. bennet said this' story........

      ok, so today is wednesday, and wednesday is the day that my friend gail and i play the lottery- i call her my millionaire friend, by the way, because i am convinced that we will win one day.  we will, by the way, establish a scholarship fund at dhs for students who graduate with a 3.5 or higher- .  with the rest.....i will buy a paris apartment- something at la muette metro stop which is near the bois de bologne in passy.  i have been there several times visiting marmatton museum- it is quite peaceful. in my mind i have decorated it over and over- while i cook or swim laps, both with finds from the flea markets or from a decorator (pierre frey) . this is probably the most personal thing i have disclosed in this blog- my dream paris apt.- of course in my dreams i can actually speak french- not just mumble catch phrases. i suppose i am thinner in my dreams as well, and order bolder wines- but i certainly do not wear foolish heels or plunging necklines..........

      ok, so this lbrary book sale is getting out of hand......everyday i pick up cayle at the library i see yet another book on the sale table- i am now nearing 25 books that lay unread on my steps because i lack the space to put 25 new books. it has been suggested that i 'retire' 25 books from active duty, and/or donate them to the library.  to me, my relationship with books is the 'til death do us part' variety. we will simply have to build more shelves, somewhere.  speaking of building, i am thinking about building drawers and shelves into the sides of our bedroom, into the crawlspace under the eaves, and moving out our too-small dressers. this move would make our bedroom much larger and give us more drawer space- i would move my dresser down to the guest room when i move my sewing cabinet up to cayle's room when cayle moves into stephan's room when stephan moves into andrew's room- got it?  musical chairs was never this complicated.  ernst says that stephan cannot move into andrew's room until the carpets have been cleaned, so it all may wait til that chore is arranged........

      ok, so at my class last night, i looked down to check off names from the roster of students- and i cannot focus on the paper-  i can barely make out the letters- and in order to not look totally incompetent to new students, i blunder on for a few names until i just whip off the glasses to see if they are just smudged (which would be better than me going blind in a matter of minutes....) i wiped them off, and then noticed, to my horror, that they were NOT MY GLASSES. they were stephan's glasses which i must have picked up by mistake when i washed my face in the upstairs bathroom before leaving the house.  not only could i not read the fine print in the text to do the lecture, i knew that stephan could not do his homework for not being able to read his text.  i gave my lecture from memory- and felt grateful that i can still well enough to drive without glasses.........ok, so this story is not as good as losing stephan in the nyc subway, but it is still amusing.......

      ok, so i entertain myself while cooking by imagining trip scenarios. the following is le voyage de jour:  day 1- fly to paris day 2 arrive in paris; lunch in a recommended place- something nice like la bookiniste on the left bank; dash into ste, chapelle for a quick look at windows if it is sunny; maybe go to a museum i haven't vitied before like cognac-jay(sp!) or another one of the house museums; nice supper and to bed early. day 3- sleep in very late; lunch at a cute place; visit louvre with emphasis on newer wing that i haven't fully seen even in 2 visits....; supper and to bed early day 4 early tgv to bordeaux (about 3 hours); lunch then visit to regional museum with replica of lasceaux (sp) Or rather lacrosse caves maybe a wine tasting at wine institute;          supper then to bed early (this will be winter and we really got tired in europe the last cold weather trip.....) day 5 train to san sebastian- tapas lunch then on to see the new opera house and sculpture museum; tapas supper  day 6- bilbao- lunch at museum; supper in the pelli shopping area day 7- bilbao?  day 8- train back to biarritz? to back to bordeaux to catch tgv to paris day 9- paris- maybe train to melun to see vaux-le-vicomte, a spectacular chateaux built before versailles- by the same craftsmen and architect day 10- paris- maybe trip to malmaison, josephine's chateaux day 11- home  i don't speak spanish, so a brief dash into spain may be the best for my first visit.  i understand that ms. bennet has included barcelona on her dream trip for spring break.......i would not want my dream trip to be similar to her trip in any way........  i could, at this very moment be preparing for my 6:00 class at eku-danville, but i am not doing so.........

      ok, so dubya looks to be on track to drag the united states into another vietnam- based on nothing more than that saddam hussein is a bully.  there are many bullies in this world- including dubya himself- using his logic the rest of the world would be coming after us.....  i understand that the bible lessons continue, with jacob, isaac, etc. this woman's prosletizing knows no shame, it seems.  now ernst is also upset- because learning time is being taken up with bible lessons.  however, our child actually in the class has asked us not be make his life miserable by making a fuss.........maybe when she gets out of mesoptamia she will find fewer reasons to bring up the bible.  better idea- students could bring up a good quote- eccliastes (sp) (the teacher) said for everything there is a season......a time to plant and a time to reap.......etc well- there is a time for the bible and a time for the actual textbook.......

      ok, so this morning, after i left off my middle child at the wrong door at the wrong time, npr ran a piece about the poet ogden nash, who was born 100 years ago today, and in whose honor a new stamp is being released, complete with tiny poems on each stamp that require a magnifying glass to read.  i cannot remember poetry well, but the one read this morning that i CAN remember went like this:  the lord above he made the fly, and then forgot to tell us why.  nash was famous for short snappy little bits of poetry rather than intensive or long tomes.    i have pondered my blog about friends who went to college to find husbands, and feel quite grateful that i didn't fall madly for ernst until the very week i finished graduate school.  how is that for 'meant to be.........?'

      ok, so i am having dorm flashbacks- to t\really silly people i met in smith dorm at ohio state, and an even sillier person that i actually knew before i roomed with her.  i was under no illusions that she was going to set the world on fire academically, but i was surprised to discover that she enrolled in college to find a husband- who (whom?)she found after 2 quarters.  she never finished college, married him, and was later dumped and divorced by him when he discovered that she was not as helpful as climbing the corporate ladder as his girlfirend turned out to be...........she is working as a private detective somewhere in the midwest. incidentally, my own cousin debbie stayed only 1 quarter to osu- after she met her husband to be.  she has finished college, however, which redeems this husband-finding practice somewhat, i suppose.......anyway, back to silly dorm people- most in my recollection were at college to party rather than to attend class or read books.........maybe time in a quiet space- without cable tv or internet connection will promote good study habits.  mean mamma can only dream......

      ok, so andrew got a letter friday from uk explaining that he probably would not get any on-campus housing this semester, and suggested that he look off-campus for the time-being. he is on a waiting list, the length of which was not disclosed.  this afternoon we went up to lexington to look at an apartment kept by a friend who lives in danville (she needed a lexington address to keep her health insurance coverage.....). it is 6 miles from campus, which is better than the distance from danville if he were to commute from home.  she is willing to let him stay there short-term- until something turns up on campus after the first few weeks when people decide to chuck it all and go back home.   i would so rather move andrew into a dorm his first time away from home, and i have got to get used to the fact that he may have to live totally on his own from the get-go.  locking his own door, taking out his own garbage, buying his own groceries........i do believe that he can do all of these things, but i hate to see him miss the dorm thing.  i only stayed in a dorm 1 year before moving on to a series of roommates and a series of apartments- mostly run-down places near campus.  this place is almost too nice and pristine--i hope he takes very good care of it since it belongs to a good friend and i want to stay good friends with her.........

      ok, so some people do not understand (1) the concept of recycling (2) the reality that beer bottles, once the beer is consumed, are truly empty. at the wedding we catered yesterday, the groom bought ten or so cases of beer, and one bottle of white zinfandel (in case there was someone who didn't drink beer......) all but one case was consumed, and was presented to one of the groomsmen as the reception was clearing out.  he sat in the lobby waiting for a ride with another guy, and continued to drink fromt he fullbottles in the case while he waited.  at this point, i figured the place was empty enough to justify dragging all of the cases of empty bottles to our truck so that i could run them by the recycling center on my way home.  (i didn't want there to be 9 cases of beer bottles in the back of the truck if i had to drive it to church.....)  so when i was carrying the last case out through the lobby toward the truck, this wiseguy finally notices and says .....yerhhhhhhhh what are you doing with our beer.  i tried to explain that these were empties, but he insisted on looking in the case  just to be sure i wasn't going to be drinking any beer that he could drink himself.  what a jerk.......he really did say something that sounded like yerhhhhhhh- a slightly drunken yerhhhhhhh...........

      ok, so last night after we closed, i waited outside the service door with one of the waitresses, whose husband had not yet arrived to take her home.  such a motley crew of humanity goes by toward the dq or the b-r or pj-  at one point an old caddy with all the windows rolled down and the rap blasting cruised by, and this kind-of ugly punk mutters- 'hey, mamma.'  i started laughing- he was half right, wasn't he?..........

      ok, so this morning i went through all of the template options for blogger- being so thoroughly impressed by the loyal opposition's revolving series of clever set-ups. i couldn't find one that just screamed 'mean mamma'  so i kept the one i chose originally.  which is not surprising, in that the fabric that is laying around the house to cover worn-out furniture looks remarkedly like the old fabric. when i grow up i will be bold and brazen..........or at least tall and thin with purple spikey hair.......

      ok, so today i heard that at danville high school-the center of higher learning in our fair town- that  in the world history class it was taught that mankind sprung forth from the garden of eden.  ms bennet declined to discuss all that science stuff, and attempted to locate the garden of eden on the middle eastern map.  despite my being a baptist, and a sunday school teacher at that, i am terribly embarassed for ms bennet, beyond the fact that she cannot pronounce any words from the text book after several years teaching the course........separation of church and state, as decreed in our constitution was meant for this very purpose- to keep religious dogma from the ears of our children at the taxpayers expense...i may not raise a fuss now- but if the garden of eden shows up on a test, and i have proof rather than hearsay of her prostletising (sp) i will raise heck over this issue......

      ok, so today we had this really horrific scene happen at the restaurant, and i wasn't there because i went o get my hair cut.  a woman and her teenage daughter came in through the service entrance, and then proceeded to look around like they were expecting to find someone they knew- and they did- her husband with his girlfriend.  a scene ensued, with the wife screaming unrepeatable things to the girlfriend before the husband escorted her outside- without paying the bill of course........then everybody started to peak out the front windows to see if they could catch a glimpse of the scene on the street.  ah well.........it had to happen sometime- the clandestine meeting thing, but somehow it is hard to imagine two-timing your partner over soup and sandwich..............

      ok, so a former nutrition education intern stopped by yesterday. she was in town doing training at krogers- she is a nutrition educator for kroger company with a huge territory (the nashville and louisville divisions). it was great to see her- especially since she says the is doing all the things i used to do in danville- grocery store tours, cooking classes, workshops, and getting paid well for it.  she spent 6 months with me working through all of the requirement necessary to qualify to take the dietetic registration exam- i am thrilled that she passed.  the very last student that i had failed to pass..........though i didn't get the impression that she actually reviewed for the exam.  my recertification test for diabetes education comes up the end of october- i have yet to start the review process.........

      ok, so today the client i saw in a doctor's office after work was born within 5 days of me- in 1956.  i find these things fascinating- i have met at least 5 people born the same day (february 25) and have actually met someone born the same day and year (she was having her 8th baby on welfare and looked about 10 years older than i felt at the time........) yet and still, meeting people very near to your own exact age is intriguing- this guy had a new baby with his girlfriend (his oldest child is 24)  whoa- i cannot imagine getting up and changing diapers at my age.  maybe i am really hoping to find a mirror image of myself, someone about my age who made similar choices that would somehow validate the path that i have taken.  maybe she will also be mean and her children will accuse her of hiding their personal belongings when they have in fact misplaced them without her interference.............

      ok, so everybody is back in school except andrew- who does not yet have a dorm room.  surely u of k has one bed left in the honors dorms of boyd or patterson.  just a place to lay his head at night is all his family asks.  then stephan will move into andrew's room and cayle will move into stephan's room  and we will of course have to re-wallpaper cayle's new room because she has never gotten to decorate a room before.  i am hopeful that no kittens or puppies will be involved on borders.....that is right up there with thomas kincaid houses that glow in my personal book of what passes for tacky......

      ok, so my sisterinlaw lisa spent a curious amount of time over the weekend telling me about the kind of hair rinse she uses- the name, the number of shampoos it is good for before it fades, the colors that turn out darker than promised, etc.  curious, because i cannot yet detect grey in my hair, and because i am not yet sure that i want to mess with keeping up with hair rinses, let alonr permanent hair color changes.  i sat yesterday in church gazing at the back of heads (we always sit in the balcony and with renovation we now sit in the very back...) so many women fail to keep up with their roots, and sometimes this can have embarrassing results.  there was a dhs cheerleader there yesterday with her boyfriend who was there with his grandmother (how is that for vague....) and her blond and brown phases met in a stripe somewhere down the middle of her back- at this point she could either bleach the whole mess blonde again, or get her hair cut short so that the distinct blond ends were gone.  sadly, she probably sees only the front, rahter than the striped back, but surely the sides have the same skunk-like look.  maybe there is a third choice- that she likes it all this way and plans to keep it up.  ah well, she wasn't alone in the roots growing out visibly category- most women i noticed had grey roots peeking out from either blonde,  golden brown, or auburn tresses- nobody seemed to have chosen darker shades for covering grey.  unless this coloring thing is done at home it could be expensive- many of thesre women seem to be the kind who have weekly hair appointments and do not wash or style their own hair in between.  how does this habit happen- the weekly appointment and the trusting of someone else to wash ones hair but once a week? i cannot go one day without washing my hair, let alone 7 days.  i would rather have a bad hair day with clean hair than a good hair day with an unwashed head.  something to ponder as one ages........

      ok, so my leisurely morning habits of getting up at 7, reading the paper over coffee on the deck til 7:30 then checking email and blogwriting til 8 end today.  frankly the reality of school-year mornings is not appealing- the dragging of reluctant bodies out of bed, and cojoling to come on downstairs and eat something before the car leaves, the finding of half-eaten bagels under seats.....the forgetting of lunch money, pencils, books, entire backpacks.......the getting of children to school before the tardy bell rings.......all of this means that i get to work 40 minutes earlier than i have done so this summer. in terms of work this is not all bad, but in terms of personal quiet time this is tragic.    speaking of quiet time, i have taken to swimming laps between our dock and the neighbors dock.  the water is getting just a hint of chill, especially yesterday when the day was cloudy with a few scattered clouds.  i hope to swim through september before starting to walk with books on tape again.  nothing compares to swimming- however. i believe that this horiscope thing has some base in human nature- both i and my daughter (pisces and aquarius) find much joy in the water.  the chill goes away when the laps start, but not before i imagine such endeavors such as swimming the english channel- i am not near enough of a real swimmer to undetake such a thing- but the cool water makes me think of heading toward france across the choppy waves.........

      ok, so i enjoyed the bridal shower i catered today, for the wrong reasons. after it was over, i ran by the kroger store to get what i need to make my annual back-to-school lasagnas for friends who teach.  there were so many humorous folks at the store during that random time slot- i am still laughing. i was looking for the frozen ravioli when i came upon an aquaintance from a 'prior workplace' munching down on a free ice cream sample, and turned the corner and came upon yet another prior aquaintance doing the same thing.  they both looked guilty as hell to be caught in the midst of eating ice cream- like it was a sin or something. finally i saw the actual ice cream sample lady- and she offered  me a sample- which i refused.  she got kind of indignant, with me refusing her ice cream- but i don'[t like ice cream all that much, i attempted to explain. not like ice cream? she exclaimed as if disliking icecream is akin to being a communist. no, i do not care particularly for ice cream,  i do like graeter's raspberry chocolate chip, but that is about it.  there are 2 cartons in my freezer right now, and i will not have one bowl from either container because ice cream simply doesn't appeal to any of my taste buds nor sensory cells.  not like salty, crunchy foods- i particularly like salt and vinegar potato chips, especially the special onion flavor salt and vinegar potato chips.  i believe that this particular food is a gift from God directly to me.  and with a glass of good beer, there may be no finer taste combination.  gos bless america i wish i had a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips............

      ok, so i heard upseting newsd about mrs. floyd (kay) of bate math- she is currently at emrmc and just had a biopsy of a cancerous place in her shoulder- probably in her shoulder bone. this is not good in that she is still recovering from breast and colon cancers. she insists that she will start school tuesday as planned, and has said that she will not repeat the experimental surgury she had in december as the doctors in cincinnati have suggested.  i do not know what i would do if i were her- kay has been dealing with cancer for as long as i have known her, and i suspect that she is wanting her last days to be with some dignity rather than all sliced up and drugged up. do keep her in your prayers........

      ernst's sister lisa came for a brief visit with her middle child and a friend- they came to danville by way of the extreme sports park in louisville where they spent the morning on skateboards.  alex and his friend are 14- he is going to be a freshman in a catholic school in cincinnati- we had avery nice supper out on the deck, and caught up on all of the estate-settling gossip- lisa is the executrix of her mother's estate- which could be resolved in the next month or two.  i will believe it when i see it.  we had a nice chat about how we miss her mother (my motherinlaw), but did both share in some memories of awful, thoughtless things she said to us and about us.  i guess all families have these sort of memories- which are basically unresolved issues now that we cannot tell the person how much these comments hurt.  one of my favorite lines from my motherinlaw was the time she was looking at vacation pictures of ours, with pictures of each of us, and groups of us c-w's and stated 'kathy, you don't photograph well, do you'  there is not much one can say after your motherinlaw says something like that to you- of course, she could have said something nice to soften that blow- like kathy you always look better in person than you do in photos- but no- she left it with the insult.  ah well, unresolved issues.....maybe that is why i am so mean today...........

      ok, so the salmon with cucumber sauce went quickly, as did the three-color tomato and cucumber salad. we fed over 60 people last night- it was mayhem.  happily there were game hens left over, so i don't have to cook supper tonight on my day off.......life is good.  on the other hand i have decided that the brits probably don't serve beef wellington hot, as it falls apart when sliced. it does slice nicely when cold but it doesn't taste near as good that way. i will have to figure out how to solve this dilemna the next time i am foolish enough to fix this dish- i had one pretty slice out of 12- those are terrible stats.....

      ok, so it is friday, and that means that i won't get home til at least 10 tonight- we have 47 reservations for people wanting our dinner/playhouse combo, which tonight is murder at the vicarage.  i am fixing cornish game hens in  an apricot glaze, my version of beef wellington, and baked salmon with a cucumber sauce.  yummmmm.  i need to think up a vegetarian dish, of course........  i started undaunted courage- a book about merriweather lewis and the expedition. i am also reading as i lay dying, but the lewis book was on the front table when i was in the mood to pick up a book.  lewis really loved his mother, according to the frist 2 chapters about his early life.  there is an excerpt from a letter he wrote to her somewhere along the upper missouri river pledging his undying support for her in her old age.  now that is my kind of boy.........this woman was some sort of herbalist, and lived well into her 80's helping to heal the sick in her neighberhood.  she did marry the man her husband suggested to her on his death bed- now that is a concept that i found a bit disturbing. but that was a different time- when women alone had a rough go of it when it came to protection, financial management, etc. so the widow lewis married her 1st husband's hand chosen successor within 6 months of his death- and she outlived that guy, too- but without another death bed pick she remained an unmarried widow the rest of her days.......the book is just getting to the part where lewis meets jefferson.........

      OK, SO stephan and i heard a mortefying piece on npr on the way home from work today- it was about how the drug companies used propaganda to promote menopausal hormone use - since the 50's.........the one spot we heard was an older woman who said that she took hormone pills because she feared that her husband would leave her for an younger woman if she didn't.......i was so appalled that i almost wrecked the car- of course- the woman in the spot was complaining of her symptoms- hot flashes, lack of shortterm memory, and meannness.........but the part about her fears of her husband leaving her really upset me- this woman sounded like she lived only for her husband to come home from work- that was her first mistake....... she sounded very republican in that regard.... why didn't she have a life of her own, for gracious sakes.   i can recall meeting a woman at work when i first moved to town- who i asked to get together with sometime after work for a glass of wine- and she said she would have to ask her husband- same difference- she would probably ask her husband before taking hormones......in this regard i have to give kudos to ecw- he knew from the get-go that i was not likely to consult him on many issues at all- maybe financial ones- but then he wasn;t looking for an appendage, either.......young ones- beware of those males who are looking for unpaid personal slaves rather than full partners.........they are the kind who probably will leave you for a younger woman......

      ok, so i have always suspected that clients whitewash their personal accounts of foods eaten at any given meal to make their weight problem seem less like their fault.  today, i was understandingly shocked when a client admitted to the following lunch:  big mac at mcdonalds, which she consumed while driving to arby's where she ordered a chicken cordon bleu and a regular arby's roast beef, which she consumed before she got home so her husband wouldn't find out.  whoa............if that eating scenario is one that she will own up to, i wonder what she actually eats in any given day- and it is not like her husband doesn't really know that she overeats..........i used to know this woman- who appears to have gained 100 pounds over the past 2 years- now that is a real feat- to gain 50 pounds a year 2 years running. notice, by the eway that no identifying info has been provided, as not to violate patient/therapist trust- but really- how does one gain 100 pounds in 2 years without noticing until now that eating has gotten out of hand. my extra pound or two makes me just a bit more mean than usual........imagine how mean that mean mamma would be with 100 extra.........yerhhhhh  i broke down yesterday and bought the dvd of lotr- even though the version coming out in november has lots of unseen footage and will be much cooler.  i cannot wait til november- i could probably wear out this disk by november.  many parts still surprise me ,even after seeing it on the big screen, and having read the books twice over in anticipation of the films.  i do like the scenery and the special effects like the giant statues guarding the lake at the end, and the whole of rivendell- which looks like a thomas kincaid painting with its own special glow.

      okay, so i fear that my blog about dewey dell in as i lay dying was interpreted as an anti-abortion crack on my part, and i apologize for the confusion and misunderstanding. i should have put 'evil' theme in quotes to assure that the satirical intention was heard clearly. i merely speculated that the abortion sub-plot may have caused this book to be banned.  it is unfortunate that dewey dell is such a wretched creature- faulkner may have been pro-life or anti-women for all i know- certainly he viewed some women as unromantic, fickle, thoughtless beings- dewey dell has sex with another cotton picker based on her basket being full when she reaches the end of the row and can take her earned 'work break' in the woods before starting another basket.    i am half-way into the book- it reads quickly because faulkner uses no extra words of any kind- his diction is quite pared down and sparse.  one feels the tragedy more intensely this way, i believe.

      ok, so i received the first of 4 books i ordered online from half.com for bookclub this year- as i lay dying, by faulkner. it came with cliff  notes- of all things unexpected!!!!! i have never had need of cliff notes, so i found the format fascinating. character scetches, plot lines, scene setting information, info about faulkner (like the u in faulkner was added by mistake by a printer and he decided to keep it....) i did start to read the actual book, and have decided that it reminded me of thomas hardy in many ways- return of the native, or the mayor of casterbridge- so many tragic characters, so little time.....i have yet to figure out why so many libraries and schools banned this book- the cliff notes mentioned that one character is seeking an abortion- maybe that is the evil theme that led this book to be on banned lists- like reading about this wretched girl will inspire other girls to do the same......so far i have not embraced faulkner's style- at least not in the way that i am drawn to reread hardy- maybe it is because hardy's books take place in wessex and faulkner is merely in the hot and humid south.......

      ok, so i cannot find my paperback copy of tender is the night by fscottfitzgerald- it is so annoying to have books that cannot be located. i have tried all of the usual locations for truant books- under my bed, the stack beside the loveseat in our bedroom, the basket in the big bathroom, in addition to allof the bookshelves/ i even looked in the cookbook shelves hoping that i had placed it there in some sort of senior moment.  i cannot find the great gatsby either -they may be together.  book club is coming up in mid-september and i want to be prepared even though i have read this book at least 5 times.  i just finished a reread of persuasion- i am struck with some of the similarities of storyline- with regard to the worship of beauty in this world, and the personal faults that people will overlook just be in the company of beautiful people.  and the personal value that others will overlook if one lacks physical beauty. tender is the night really doesn't address the second theme- as fscott was personally beautiful and he would have no clue about being undervalued because of a lack of personal beauty..............

      ok, so i almost blogged on stephan's blog because he failed to sign out before getting up from the computer, but then that would be mean, and even mean mamma has her standards..............................  i overheard a workmate yesterday talking about her name with another co-worker- she cited her last name as her slave name- and noted that she didn't know what her real family name was- that her family had taken the name of the master long ago and kept it. it occured to me that marriage is sort of like that- by tradition women take the name of their '7 day lord and master' and give up their own family names.  except that they remember what that name is.......of course, 21 years after kind of keeping my birth name i still have people comment on it- like there was something worng with my husband's name rather than i was proud of my famiy name and was loathe to give it up.......

      ok, so our computer monitor has bit the dust, so i am forced to hook up our laptop to the modem to access the internet.  i have many things to report- one being that i talked again to mardi montgomery, ryan montgomery's mother, at the danville soccer alumni game- she quit her position as english teacher at bchs on thursday, and she will be working for danville schools as the gifted and talented coordinator- for those who don't know mardi- she was the best thing that bchs had to offer, and now she is working for danville. life is good.    stephan attended the preservation conference held this week at centre- and learned about historical buildings that can be saved, how one goes about saving them, etc. this conference was an interesting juxtaposition to the destruction of the fourplex next to stith funeral home on broadway across from the library.  that fourplex was owned by henry j. ernst-ernst c-w's namesake- we call him h.j-  now hj moved to danville from newport, ky to set up the sewing machines at palm beach in the 30's- he married his third wife in danville, and lived in the lake house- now our house. when 'aunt ginny' died, he moved to a vacant apartment in his fourplex- he was living there when i started going out with ernst- the first i ever heard of danville was when billy barnet the lawyer called kathyrn (ernst's mother) to tell her that she had to come get hj out of jail- he had thought that someone was breaking into his car, and when the police came he got confused and thought they were 'the damn kids' breaking into his car and started shooting his rifle at them.  the first time i came to danville was to help clean out the apartment at the fourplex and the lakehouse.  the job at the hospital came up soon after, and we moved to town. we managed the apartment building for a time- i can remember a little old lady calling us up in the middle of the night to tell us that a mouse had bitten through her hose on her washing machine and what were we going to do about it.  grandpa moved home with kathryn for awhile, and then to an assisted lving home, and then back to friendship/fellowship on north third street. the building on broadway was sold to the orthodontist to pay for the nursing home- the orthodontist then sold it to stith.  and now it is gone.  kathryn is also gone- which is a blessing, because she would have been upset about the bulldozing of the building.  not a historical building, not one of architectural merit, but one that had meaning in the small c-w circle of memories.

      ok, so i surfed a bit this afternoon to relax and found an offensive site called curmudgeonry, or something liek that- for people who have many gripes and need to be heard- i may be mean, but i try very hard not to be banal when it comes to my griping- the first gripe was about britney spears- who is not even on my radar screen when it comes to sounding off- so much for 'reading around'.  i did see on the net that an architect has been chosen for princess di's memorial- to be in london near the serpentine wall. it will be a shallow water feature where children can play, yet can be lit up and landscaped elegantly. di would have liked it, i am sure.  i happen to be a di-hard dianaphile-, and still mourn her passing.  despite the many faults she may have had, she married less than a month after i did, had two sons about the same time- and had a flair for fashion that i coveted.  the world is a sadder place without her......

      ok, so i continue with travel fantasies- i would rather take the first trip scenario- the one that involved a rental car and a flight to barcelona with a loop through the dordogne, bordeaux and bilbao.  one would think that one rental car exerience was enough for mean mamma- but that is just it- mamma is simply too mean to let a few unfortunate instances keep her from having a good time.

      ok, so i stand corrected on this sophomore/world civ thing- ryan montgomery assured me this very evening that as of this week he is teaching american studies with jan scott now that miss sanders has moved on to a job in frankfort.  he said that who is teaching what has been in a kind of flux, as dhs has hired at least 10 new teachers, he being one of them,. he was at the preservation conference event that we catered at constitution square this evening, along with chris harmon, the bchs swimmer, who went through the buffet line at least 3 times.    having had no vacation this summer, i have begun to fantasize about travel as i work.  an alternation travel scenaro follows:  day 1- fly to paris; sightsee in afternoon; to bed early day 2- paris day 3- tgv to bordeaux- afternoon wine tasting, museum, and good lunch and supper; sleep in bordeaux day 4- train to bilbao; museum in afternoon day 5- bilbao day 6- train to madrid day 7- madrid day 8 train to barcelona day 9- barcelona day 10- train to paris day 11- paris day 12- fly home  imagining travel plans always makes me happy.

      ok, so i am assigning a reading list prior to this trip-  i would appreciate that all of my fellow traveler's read hemingway's the sun also rises- it is set in both paris and spain- st. sebastian and pamplona- since i was in paris with each of the intended voyagers, and will travel to these places with them as well- it makes reading the book essential.....it takes place about the time of the civil war.. certainly no quiz involved- but an intelligent discussion of major themes would be greatly rewarded.......now that we have a car we can visit the town of guernica, in preparation for seeing the painting....from reading my guide books- lonely planet, rick steves and dk eyewitness- i beilieve that i may have to go into major alcoholconsumption training prior to this trip- it seems that drinking is all that is done in the towns that we intend to visit. i am very much enjoying my eyewitness spain book- i love the color collages of each town of note, as well as cutaway views of the insides of major buildings. these previews are so helpful in navigating....  i bought the spanish movie 'open your eyes' that tom cruise bought and made into 'vanilla sky' starring himself.  it has english subtitles- so far i have picked up only the words hola, adios, amigo,  and very few more.....i lack the language gene, apparantly, and though i will devote much time and effort to trying to learn spanish phrases, i have great doubt on my retention potential.......

      ok, so corellia took off friday, so no news on a car rental.......one would think after the last car rental that such things would have no interest- but after studying the guide books there are many places 'on the way' that would be neat to see-  we could see the roman ruins at tarragona on the way to bilbao, for instance.  we would also want to jettison the car at the madrid airport before venturing into town- i'll not do a big city in a car again.........i have downloaded several articles about st. sebastian- i had forgotten that hemingway set part of the sun also rises in this town it appears to be close to bilbao, as does the original town of guernica, which was bombed by the germans in 1939 as a favor to franco.....so many options, so little time.....

      ok, so i have gone back to one of my scenarios- and monday january 6 puts us visiting st. sebastian-= a town near to bilbao on the bay of biscay with a really cool opera house (new) and beach sculpture. i have really never seen the atlantic from the european side- this would be an adventure.  corelia says that train tickets from barcelona to bilbao and bilbao to madrid run $58 2nd class plus $11 per reserved seat- the train rides are long- neither segment gets us into town earlier than 9:45 pm- of course- in spain, the restaurants are still hopping........at that hour.

      ok, so there was an article in the lexherlead this morning about blogging, and how ucla now has a journalism course dedicated to blogging- imagine- a course to do what i already do- or worse- to do better what i cannot imagine doing better. should i feel somehow inadequate because i lack post-grad training in self-expression? or maybe these people will learn how to blog without self-censorship- as if no one but oneself is reading. maybe in the course they will learn how to do links.............

      ok, so i have discovered that my earlier scenario that put us in bilbao on a monday won't do, as the guggenheim is closed on mondays. i am studying the matter and will find a workable solution.  i recently had opportunity to discuss our trip to spain with someone i have known for over 20 years.  "are you taking a tour?' was the response.  i am still aghast, as certainly someone who professes to know me well would understand that i am not capable of going on a tour, with someone else in charge, with a timetable not of my own making.  i am convinced that dante left the 'package tour' circle of hell out of his manuscript because the church-owned tourism concessions would have gone bankrupt.........anyway, i do have the greatest of admiration for those who can sit back in confidence that someone who knows what they are doing is driving the bus, but i can never be certain that the people in charge have prepared more than myself for the day.....i will concede that driving in cities where i cannot look at the map every 3 minutes does lead to chaos and wasted time in getting to cathedrals and other desirable sights.  i like the planning end of travel almost as much as the being there part.

      ok, so we have a guest speaker at church today, and mean mamma would just as soon stay home- rather, mm would rather go back to bed and sleep til she has gotten over this overwhelming fatigue that comes with working all day saturday.  alas, if mm doesn't go to church on just one sunday, her little ones will start thinking that church is optional, and moral decay will break out, she is certain.    speaking of moral decay, mm failed to watch the miss america pageant on tv last night. this breaks a 40+ year streak of watching this spectacle- mostly to watch the clothes and to see if miss ohio, i mean miss ky won anything.....there was once a girl who lived down the hill from my grandparents in independence, ohio that won the title. they pointed out her parents nursery and plant stand every time we passed by until they both passed away. ah well, instead, ecw and i watched this french movie with english subtitles- pierrot le fou, by jean-luc goddard and starring jean-paul belmondo- a 60's movie that was quite surreal and hard to follow- not because of language but because they would inexplicably have on different clothes when you knew that had no luggage (being on the run) and you didn't see them steal any......... the whole time jean-paul belmondo kept writing poetry in his journal- and the girl wouldn't understand it and he would tell her that he wasn't sure if he loved her if she couldn't understand his most intimate thoughts.  i didn't stay up til the end because i was tired. i was also bummed out because acw didn't come home this weekend. i really miss that boy.......

      ok, so i had an unfortunate altracation with an aquaintance on the phone tonight at the restaurant- we were serving a 50th wedding anniversary party about 7:00-  drunk aquaintance- eeeezzz theeezzz kcw?  theezz ezzz ______________ can weeeeeee come for deeeeener?     kcw- i am sorry, we are not open on saturday night.  we are open.. m-f ...etc, etc.....  d.a.- but you are there now- cannnnnnnnn't weeeeeeeee come oveeeeeeerrr and eat?  kcw- i am sorry, but we have just served everything that we made this evening for this dinner.  d.a.- but donnnnnnnt you waaaaaaant to feeeeex dinner for 7 of your closest friends?    kcw- i am sorry but my closest friend ernst is holding dinner for me and when this party is over i am going home.......  d.a.- caaaaaaant you fiiiiiiiind sometheeeeeeng for us to eaaaaaaat?  kcw- thanks for calling- i have to get back this party......goodbye.  an unfortunate reminder that drunk doesn't sound very cool when it is someone else and you are dead tired and cold sober.........this person had no business driving anywhere let alone my business, and i am sure that his wife was horrified if she was in earshot.

      ok, so no one residing in my house seems to know the score from last nights game-even personages who were actually at the game.  the score was not on the news last night and it was not in the paper today.....very curious.  the baseball incident did make the papers- the father and son who leaped from the stands onto the playing field to beat up the first base coach of the kc royals- both were tatooed, by the way-and apparantly sharing some quality time together when they decided to commit felony battery and assault in full public view.  of course, all this pales to gov patton's tearful plee for forgiveness. i have little faith in someone who didn't suspect that any of 440 phone calls made to her personal numbers would leave a paper trail.......i also find amusement in the 5 hour thing- somehow he doesn't strike me as a 5-hour man.......he seems more like someone who would jump onto a baseball field and beat up the first base coach, however.......

      ok, so  monday i am going to call corelia at aaa and buy our tickets.  leaving lex on 1/01/03 going to barcelona and back from madrid on 1/11/03.  i  borrowed a book on spanish at the library- i haven't a clue about spanish.....this could be a real adventure.

      ok, so it seems i have seen guernica- in nyc during spring break of 1975- with jon patterson, who left osu the next year to go to cornell where he hoped to get into cornell's vet school and be a small animal vet....he had the biggest afro imaginable for a tall skinny white guy....golly neds, that was a long time ago.  the only other things i remember about that trip was the ride up- in the back of a pinto (or similar), that it was so very cold in march in nyc, and that in the cafeteria at the met i had a rare roast beef sandwich- i had never before had rare roast beef- it was delicious.......

      ok, so mm doesn't have anything quite as clever as l.o.- i have to congratulate l.o. on her razor-sharp wit. i am impressed, as always.........  mean mamma hopes to say hello to her friend, jane- who surely has by now figured out how to access mean mamma's blog.  i have worried about her, and feared that she may have been in the hospital or otherwise indisposed during the past summer. i hope she is ok now and getting around as best she can.......i do believe that mamma's friend jane has been to spain- i recall that trip 20+ years ago whereupon she put the whole thing on her amex., and was somewhat shocked when amex wanted their cash, in full, at the end of the month.....obviously, jane has always been my kind of traveler.....for those of you gentle readers that do not know mamma's friend jane, we always drink champagne when we are together- and jane is the kind of gal that can make sitting in a wheelchair drinking champagne look classy......well, jane- i am not putting this trip on an amex- my darling spouse now requires that i actually have the $ in the bank before i buy the tickets....those were the days.........................

      ok, so i forgot all about book club last night- i read the book early on (tender is the night) then lost track of the actual meeting date- i feel quite stupid in that i wasted lots of time after getting home- last night-reading the new spain guide books.

      ok, so i am regretting already leaving carcassone and the dordogne off of the agenda.......we will have to have a show of hands on which itinerary to follow-  yet another scenario-  day 1 fly away day 2 arrive barcelona; stay in neighborhood of gaudi church; walking tour of area day 3 barcelona- picasso and gaudi day 4 drive to carcassonne; stay in area day 5- drive to dordogne- stay in sarlat day 6- dordogne- rocamadour; cave paintings..... day 7 drive toward spain via bergerac (it is really on our way..) day 8 st. sebastian (in spain) day 9 bilbao day 10 drive back to barcelona (about 6 hours) via roman ruins in tarragona day 11 fly home  i would give up madrid to see dordogne; plus car rental (no diesels.......) would be less than the combined train tickets....plus,we would get to visit a part of france that is not on the way to anywhere. one interesting aside- this area around albi is known as the last hold-out of a christian sect called the albigenians (sp) who were sought out as heretics- they were the original loyal opposition.......

      ok, so i am so glad that the loyal opposition is back- she will always be thus- as she is certainly no dodo.........i am also glad the l.o. is thinking about spain.....  i am so excited about spain- my latest scenario-a bit different than the one i e-mailed to ms johnson, who has given scw permission to miss 7 days school next semester......  day 1- fly to barcelona day 2- arrive- check in- walking tour of city; good eating- early to bed day 3- barcelona- gaudi and picasso day 4- ?train south to roman ruins on ocean-front day 5- train to st. sebastian day 6 st. sebastian( on bay of biscay) train later to bilbao day 7 bilbao day 8 train to madrid day 9 madrid day 10 madrid day 11- fly home  coming back on a friday raises the ticket price $25- but i feel that i will need 2 days at home to get over the trip. i hate to come back the day before i have to be anywhere. i need a day or two to say hello to me house again, and to lay on the sofa, and just veg-out.......i have just read at rick steves site that he doesn't recommend the spain rail pass- says that the train fares are too cheap to justify it....i did enjoy reading all of the restaurant suggestions posted on the spain section of his site.  i am hungry already for tapas and potato omelets and white wine............looking ahead- i did see on rick steves sight that there is now a france/italy rail pass- may be just the thing for 2004..........fly to paris tgv marseilles- then on to tuscany.....but i get ahead of myself.....

      ok, so this morning on the way to work, the morning business report, with chi risdoll (sp) began with the words- ok, so......i started laughing out loud- it was like listening to myself for a moment...  so stephan has commited to a trip to spain- so now we have to decide which of the many scenarios we will choose.  last night ernst and i sat down to discuss the many travel opportunities that stephan has for the coming year- including a rotary exchange that will take up 6 weeks of this summer (3 weeks in belgium + 3 weeks with the belgium child at our house), the italy trip, the spain trip, margo goodwin's france trip next year, and ernst's bike trip across wyoming, idaho and oregon (2 weeks or so)  ernst was somewhat taken aback that scw would consider going to italy with ms. bennett given her lack of knowledge and preparedness in her current class- it doesn't give one much confidence on a foreign adventure- that and stephan's closer friends have either not commited to that trip or are passing altogether.  regardless, i cannot wait to see the delights of spain.  wasn't there a three dog night song that started out...i ain't never been to spain, but i have been to oklahoma......  speaking of wonderful places - i also have a fondness for boulder, colorado. my parents have college friends who live on hamilton court (in an older section of town) we visited regularly when i was growing up, and stephan stayed with them once when i went to a workshop in denver- they took him up to estes park(?) on a day trip into rmnp. i think it is just an idyllic place, with lots of things to do, places to eat- lots of good microbrewery beer........and if i had a sister, i would want her to live in such a place.....

      ok, so mean mamma has talked to correlia at aaa- the open jaw ticket, flying from lexington is $591.53- for a limited time, of course.  so mean mamma has got to decide whether to splurge on a spanish train adventure in addition to stephan's italian trip.........of course, a spanish train trip would be more fun with a few extra traveling companions.......

      ok, so the mean mamma cleaned house today- viciously cleaned house- gave 4 boxes of stuff to the good will and tossed out 6 bags full of junk.  only darkness and fatigue kept her out of the basement- that will have to wait for another day.  ernst was wise enough to drive immeidately to the goodwill, lest anyone want to go through the charitable donation and retrieve valuables.......

      ok, so i have a new travel scenario mapped out, just in case the price of right-  day 1- fly from louisville to atlanta to madrid day 2- arrive madrid; walking tour of downtown sights day 3- sleep late; prada art museum day 4- train to san sebastian- check into hotel; walking tour of sights, including new opera house day 5- train to bilbao; see gehry guggenheim, metro, shopping complexes- train back to san sebastian day 6- train to barcelona-walking tour of sights- including gaudi church and buildings day 7- barcelona day 8- fly home from barcelona (requires open jaw ticket) if not-train back to madrid day 9- fly home  right now the ticket to madrid is about $586- not open jaw- and the price of a 3 day train pass is $155- hotels are as yet unknown.  i am considering this even if stephan wants to go to italy on spring break- i may even ask ms johnson if she will forgive the 7 school days he would miss if we went.  good points of this scenario- no driving; 4 cities each with architectural importance as well as art and other cultural significance.  bad points- madrid to san sebastian is about 7 hours; madrid-barcelona is about 7 hours, and san sebastian to barcelona is unknown.  lots of time on a train..........

      ok, so the creek is starting to get a bit nippy these days. i have so enjoyed swimming laps (from our dock to the neighbors dock...) this summer- i will miss this precious little diversion when the water gets too cold.  the top warms up in the afternoons, but the lower levels are like ice after these 50-60 degree nights we have been having. in my fantasy world i have my own heated lap pool............

      ok, so stephan may be going to italy, which means mean mamma will be going no where this winter.  well, maybe nowhere- unless she can come up with some alternative travel scenario.  the trip to italy would be a good way for scw to see italy, because it is not a place that mean mamma would go without a group- and may be not even then- i guess that makes me romanophobic.......

      ok, so mean mamma feels quite smug this morning- she has finally located andrew's zip code from the uky web site- quite a feat as the site does not have something as simple as zip codes tied into the search engine.  no- one must go to student section, to the directory section, then do a zip code search for the 4 digit ending, only if you happen to know the 5 digit code.........and the dorm address.  this process took mean mamma several days to accomplish- she also located andrew's web address- now if only he would start checking both mailboxes........  mean mamma dreamed last night about the loyal opposition's newest blog header- she and all of many of her friends dressed as medieval characters, doing the hamster dance in a row- and singing- it is very clear in my dream that they sang in addition to the interpretive dance sequences.........no recollection if crows fugured at all in the scenario.....

      ok, so mean mamma has been a sluggish blogger of late- and she will rectify this failing.  today, though i keep thinking back to the wtc- to my only visit to the wtc- because sheldon and ann sent me an invitation to sheldon's opening and i took this as an invitation to travel to nyc with scw on a whim.  we went to the wtc (?building 1or 2) to get discount tickets for cats- after our visit to ellis island & the statue of liberty. we also went to a big discount store (century 21?) to buy stephan a cardigan- and therefore missed out on meeting madeline l'engle at books of wonder(stephan has since discarded both the cardigan and the madeline l'engle books, so it';s all even now.....) but the wtc- we took ots of pictures-- it was a saturday morning and few people were around. we didn't go up because i hate heights- and have declined numerous trips up high places like the tour eiffel., etc. after i lived through the first visit..........while this trip to nyc will be forever remembered as the trip whereupon i lost stephan c-w in the subway- i now choose to remember it as the trip where we stood below the twin towers in awe of the effort it took to put them up, and the trip where we stood in awe on ellis island, and the trip where we went out to dinner with sheldon's parents and talked of french food and hardy garden plants, anf the trip where we saw the exhibit at the met on peruvian gold and the partially closed guggenheim and the neat deli and the polish demonstration/parade, and the tiny hotel room, and cats- such a wonderful musical- too bad it closed for good.  all these things are my memories of 9-11.......not because they happened on 9-11, but because it was the last time i was in nyc.....  i find it quite ironic that i have been to paris 10 times, but to nyc 3 times- why such a lopsided statistic? why do i feel so welcome in paris but not in nyc?  i would go to paris tomorrow if i had the funds, but would think twice about going to nyc tomorrow.......and i have had someone try to pick my purse in paris...........well, belated thanks to the silver-tapley's for inviting us to their soiree- it was well-timed, considering, and i am thankful that we took the plunge and went ( i can say that now that the trip is paid for, cannot i?)

      ok, so i sat through the entire men's us open final- rooting for agassi though pleased that sampras pulled himself up from a 17th seeding.  in a world where we start to write off people who are 'aging' i was gratified to see that both agassi and sampras could find the strength to play the match at all......... did find the commentary quite humerous- john mcenroe said at different times.....the serve is the last thing to go.......and the backhand is the last thing to go..........like he couldn't decide which or his memory was the first to go.............

      ok, so i am thinking that i would rather rent a car in barcelona and see carcassonne and the little villages along the dordorgne and see lasceaux (sp? lacrosse?) caves- rather the simulated version that allows visitors.  surely i can manage to learn enough spanish in 3.5 months to venture out along the mediterranean in a hired car......it couldn't be worse than cologne or strasbourg...........

      ok, so andrew popped in this afternoon, made himself a sandwich, then went back to school. he came home looking to see if i had gotten the ink stains out of his shorts- the ones i washed without checking the pockets.  now mamma may be mean, but she does assume that any clothes in the laundry area have been scrutenized for stuff likes pens, money, kleenex, etc- any money she finds loose in the washer or dryer is hers by default.........alas, she cannot get the stain completely out and must move on to the drycleaner.....

      ok, so the previous blog was from the weekend- but blogger was 'full' so i had to copy it to word .............and paste it today.  i have gotten  the travel bug again- i cannot decide whether to do the paris/train to bilbao thing or venture into the car rental place again and do the barcelona/dordogne/bilbao thing. of course, one could still do paris/bilbao/barcelona/paris on the train........so many choices. i want to go somewhere in january, because if danville goes wet. we will be working nonstop figuring out how to be open more nights a week, and i may never have a day off again.......at least until we can afford to hire more people and get them trained to do what we do. in that regard, i could stay dry- because it means less work in the long run for me personally. but wilma has gone out on a limb, so i have to hope that we go wet on gerneral principle.....  i do wish that certain servers were up and running...........i know that this makes me some sort of stalker, but an unabashed one...........

      ok, so i was insulted to the core today- by someone who probably doesn't understand the degree of her damage- i was checking out at the kroger today, by someone who worked for me in an another life- she took one look at cayle and asked if she was my granddaughter......in all fairness, this woman knew me when i was birthing children, and she knows that my boys could reproduce if called on to do so, but really- do like really look old enough to have a 9 year old granddaughter- that would mean that andrew reproduced at age 9- not likely. i suppose in some ky circles, a woman could have a baby at 15, and then have a grandchild at 30 and a greatgrandchild at 45 if her daughters followed suit.....but for heaven's sakes please don't confuse these poor creatures with me and my life.........i might get over this sometime soon, maybe not........

      ok, so we have found something that cayle is not only good at, but possesses the perserverence to complete- wallpapering...........or rather, the removing of wallpaper....she stayed up late working on the wallpaper around the windowseat, and got up early to continue work on it........such a revelation for a child who usually has the attention span of a ........well- you know what i mean- the extended interest on this project is phenominal- and welcome...because the more she does, the less i have to do to get the old wallpaper off and get the new paper/border on.  of course, we have yet to decide on the new stuff- cayle wants this kitten border that looks right for a five year old- ernst and i are angling for something a little more mature that can get us through the preteen years-  she also looked at a wolfpack print (she likes to read about wolves......) several dog prints, including puppies with soccer balls,  and one with fish.   stephan's shelves went up yesterday- the room looks so much different with shelves- we should have done this when andrew moved into the room. we are still carting stephan's stuff to the basement- many more loads when you count the closet........i had visions of having all this done buy tuesday-----not bloody likely at this point.  whatever happened to kids having a small box of carefully selected belonging..........

      ok, so i watched amelie for a third time after sunday school today- yes, mean mamma skipped church so ernst and stephan could drive the van on a 'long explore' to blaton forest, near pine mountain. now, mean mamma could have been nice and agreed to go along, but no this is my 3 days off and i intend to do restful, lazy things like watch amelie for a 3rd time, take a nap, and then read-maybe on the back deck with a beer in my hand- sio anyway, ernst and stephan took off in the car, so i ordered chinese takeout and the rest of us feasted on sesame chicken and shrimp/chinese vegetables and hot/sour soup.  and i watched amelie for a third time- i really can't say enough about this movie- i guess it was so unexpected. i also watched the interviews on the second 'bonus' dvd- and learbed that the colors were digitally enhanced-especially the primary colors- to make them more brilliant and eyecatching- so the reds are more red and the greens are more green, and a blue lantern is present in some scenes to make it more french, i suppose (colette wrote by the light of her fanal bleu........) even amelie's haircut is french- angular and blunt at the same time.  having watched the 3rd time- in french with only english subtitles, i cannot say that i understand an ounce of more of french- i cannot seem to listen fast enough- the only thing i have definetly caught 'aujourd h'ui non', with subtitles 'not today'. not much for 3 viewing- what about the 6 and 7th viewings.........i will have to actually buy this dvd as andrew is taking back the dvd to his roommate today.......

      ok, so i watched amelie again last night- since the dvd was still here i thought i had better get my fill of it.......i liked it even better the second time,despite knowing how it ends, because i could pay attention to it nuances- the cartoon-like simplicity of each sequence- the director drew it like like a cartoon on a story board to make sure that it was filmed exactly like he imagined it- kind of like a graphic novel put on videotape.....to keep things simple, there are not many 'extra' people in this film- not many people on the street in street scenes, or in bar scenes- amelie's paris is quite uncrowded- i would really like this version of paris, frankl....i also like the parts where amelie gets into the mean grocer's apartment and plays tricks on him.  and the parts where amelie's father waits for the mail to bring him photos of his garden dwarf statue, who is traveling the world.  be warned, this is not a movie for the young ones- there is just enough sex (funny sex, but sex nonetheless....)to warrant an r rating. cayle was quite ticked off to be sent out of the room when we realized........half.com sells this dvd for about $16.94 including shipping- it may be the next movie i watch until my family begs me to 'find something else'  mind you,  i watch the 6 part a&e video series of pride and prejudice so much that when questions arose on the ap exam about this book, andrew was able to answer with much certainty- he got a 5 on the english ap, by the way.......maybe stephan will get a 5 on the french ap if i start watching amelie without the subtitles every day for the next 3 years........

      ok, so i stole a fireball from cayle's halloween treat bag- and now my mouth is on fire and i am too stubborn to spit it out. i will outlast this blessed thing.......i helped ecw pass out candy at the bike shop tonight- there were lots of kids- mostly little ones with parents.....lots of overweight kids this year- i had mixed feelings about giving them more candy than they already had in their bags,,,,,don';t get me wrong- i believe that candy on special occassions is a great tradition- but some of those kids looked like everyday is party time. so sad- i read recently about an 11 year old who fell over and died in her 6th grade class- she coroner blamed her weight- nearly 300 pounds- and attributed her death ot heart failure. the parents do not accept this verdict, and even deny any responsibility (they had never placed her on any sort of a diet- believing that a diet would put too much pressure on her).  ecw and i together do not weigh 300 pounds- it is hard to conceive of a 6th grader of this size....so tragic.....

      ok, so as of monday, november 4- the dollar amount of goods that us citizens can legally bring into the us doubles- to $800 per person.  however, the dollar amount of goods that the mean mamma can bring into the us without upsetting ecw remains the same.........over the years, many customs clearing episodes come to mind- there our honeymoon when ecw and i brought back 9 bottles of wine- mostly dom perignon that we bought at the winery in epernay- we had to pay duty, but i cannot remember if it was on the excess alcohol or if our total purchases were over $400 per person.  i just remember the customs agent raising his eyebrows at our wine haul.....there was also the time that  i made the mistake of declaring a jar of snails- which turned out to be ok because they were dead and processed and the ban on importing snails referred to live snails....i almost missed my connection over the jar...then there was the packet of seeds that i made the mistake of declaring- mostly because i saw the sniffing dogs- these seeds were also eventually deemed admissable- but not without much discussion and delay.  htese days i don't take any chances- and don't buy anything questionable....if i buy goat cheese, i make a point of eating it on the plane.......this treat is often better than the inflight food.......

      ok, so i am back to working on spanish- though iknow know that scw can at least order for me in restaurants......my new strategy is to say yo quiero (so?) pescado- and point to the menu in a questioning manner- and let the waiter tell me which are the fishes....now if only i can learn the word for grilled fish- i believe i could be happy with a vacation full of grilled fishes........speaking if vacation- i dreamed last night that we ran into julia roberts at the bilbao guggenheim- and we approached her for an autograpgh- which she gave us because we called her mrs. modar rather than miss roberts......what a strange thing to dream........

      ok, so this talk about game cards has reminded me about playing the barbie game with my babysitter 40 years ago- in the game Barbie-Queen of the Prom- Barbie has to earn money by landing on cash value spots on the game board, and she must use the money to buy stuff for the prom- formal dress, shoes, purse, jewelry, and she must come up with the date of her dreams by drawing the ideal date card- she wants alan or ken, but she might end up with poindexter.........she has to contend with her friends (who also get to draw cards, earn money etc.)  who also want rthe dream date, the dream outfit (the black dress with the mink triim......) and the tiara......i always enjoyed when barbie was forced to go the prom with poindexter......

      ok, so on the way back from picking up scw from guadaljara (sp!!) we heard an interesting piece on wuky- a show called studio 360- the discussion was about frames- the first segment was about the use of frames in fiction writing- one outer story frames one or more inner stories to give context, etc- the tales of the arabian nights was given as an example- this discussion sequed into a phone interview with architect frank gehry- who first talked of the time he read all of trollope's works in one frenzied series- and how he felt that trollope's works framed the 18th and 19th centuries- he went on to discuss buildings as frames- and how bilbao is a frame for the local culture- and how he is designing a new room for a client who recentlt bought a rubens at auction and wants a room designed to frame the work- the owner wants not only the frame the work came with, but also other frames used in the past included in some way in the room design-  quite an interesting discussion- we sat int he garage for quite some time listening to f. gehry-  i cannot wait to see bilbao after hearing the architect tell of it's conception as nothing short of a miracle.....

      ok, so spirited away was really really bizarre in a cult-favorite kind of way- i can see people starting to dress uplike the really big baby, or the radish, or the swamp-river blob or the twin witches, or the many-armed boiler-guy or the the faceless spirit- i don't get much of the symbolism- but then i am not japanese- there was a lot of water- both at the bath house, and with the rain and the flooded raillines- there were images of greed and gluttony (the same thing?) and a plea to save the earth- of sorts- i can honestly say that at no point int he film did i suspect what was about to happen- there was no formula.......i didn't even see the pig-thing coming........we saw a throng of people congregated down the street- in front of a new building- no idea why they were there in the dark on a sunday night- no protest signs- it was curious.  the graeter's ice cream was a treat..........

      ok, so here are the top 10 reasons why i like the 'fall back' time change-  1. i get to sleep an extra hour without guilt 2. it was actually daylight when i woke up an extra hour later today 3. i got to reset some clocks that were not accurately set during the last time change...like this computer...... 4. the newspapers have cute headlines reminding us about the change 5-10.- ok, so there are not 10 reasons- but the 4 reasons above still count.......  more about the centre homecoming party i worked last night-  one of the 'older' reunions- i am still amazed at how much whiskey was consumed- entirely by males, with their wives drinking the more demure white wine........(and plenty of that, by the way) i have never aquired a taste for bourbon- so it was surprising to see grown men reach inside coat pockets for flasks from which to pour out their favorite brand- different from the host's brand- a falsk seems so -prohibition'- which i suppose is the case here-  one man was talking about the 'bar in a box' he keeps in his car trunk so he is never without something after golfing or if a hostess doesn't offer bourbon at a party.......another talked about he and a friend brought 200 quarts of beer to their fraternity at centre years ago(?45?) and sold them to anybody but other fraternities.......being one of the few sober people at a party is a curious situation- happily we were in the kitchen and got to watch the uk game on the tiny tv- also got to see all of the score updates- osu beat penn state and michigan lost to somebody- now that is a good day in my book......i hope that i am not working during the michigan-osu game......that is the only football game that i watch as a yearly tradition......  i still cannot get over how much of the univeristy of cincinnati campus i have forgotten since 1980 when i finished my master's degree- driving in- with directions from my sister-in-law- i could barely recognize landmarks that should have been icons-  granted- i spent most of my time in the hospital 'ghetto' to the north of campus- and always went to class from that direction. i really never ventured to the side of the law school, i suppose......

      ok, so now that this test is over i am free to again think about spain- where to go, when to go there, what to eat and how to order it.......i really need a vacation- and though i will probably walk my legs into nubs i cannot wait.........

      ok, so i took the 4 hour test (200 questions- all case studies re: diabetes care)- when i went in- the street was deserted-m when i came out=- there was a homecoming parade- i had to run in front of the shriners in the funny cars to get to the parking garage......  i, too, are am saddened by the loss of senator wellstone- he was a liberal's liberal- in an age when few will fess up to having any liberal leanings........

      ok, so mean mamma has missed a few days- she has been studying diabetes care and treatment intensely- the test looms saturday am at university of cincinnati's law school- i will not stay long in cincinnati, as we have 2 parties to cater for centre homecoming saturday night- hopefully i will simply answer all 250 questions correctly, then quietly get up and leave........a trivial note- the law school building may have been designed by michael graves- the guy that designed all the cool housewares stuff for target........

      ok, so it has been suggested that my friend would not have bothered to have come by at all had she not valued my friendship and missed it enough to ask why i had withdrawn it.....and that maybe she is also working so much that she feels as if she has no life and is reaching out to someone that she used to do fun things with...now the ball is in my court, and i have to decide what to do next to either make amends or to blow it off and forget her friendship altogether....yes, she is quirky, but that is one of the things that i have always like about her.....gentle readers, sophomore year never ends, no matter  how old you get.........hence the presence of the word 'sophomoric' in our vocabulary.......

      ok, so mean  mamma is quite upset over an unsettling incident that just happened- at 8:00 am in my own place of business.......  of(old friend?)- 'c-w- i just know you are mad at me and i want to know why' - says 'of' as she bustles into the staff door of the restaurant as i am taking off my coat......  kcw- i didn't know i was mad at you- what makes you think that?  of- i think it is because of the incident at church- i have thought a lot about this and i am certain that it comes down to that.  kcw- i recall that incident only vaguely(regarding our daughters sneaking out of choir)- but really- how can i be mad if i don't really remember....  of- i just know that you must be mad because i don't see you anymore....  kcw-  you don't see me anymore because i spend all of my time working- i am either here or in the bed......i am sorry if i gave you any other impression.....  of- as she leaves-  well- i just wanted you to know that i punished  my daughter for that incident, and i just know that you are still mad about it..... (of drives away in her late-model suv) and mean mamma bursts into tears because it occurs to her that 'of' has become 'unstable', and because my work has made friendships hard to keep up with.  still, this incident is quite bizarre.  i cannot remember a similar one unless i think back to my sophomore year- when susan weller said pretty much the same thing to me with different particulars..........maybe i need a good sign of the curse to ward off the evil.........

      ok, so i am finally home from work and face more work- reading either diabetes resources or studying my lesson for eku tomorrow night- we didn't need to have class last week- as the number of chapters in the book and the number of weeks of the semester allowed me to exclude danville's fall break- so i am out of the habit of going to class on tuesday nights.....however- the paycheck from this class allows me to travel so i will buckle down and read the lesson.....i studied the diabetes stuff while the group tonight was eating, including an educational workbook that i wrote for diabetic clients while still at the hospital.....i have noted at least 3 major errors in the text- hopefully those who still work there have caught these errors and have corrected them...i am certain that my name is no longer on this piece in its recent reprints......c'est la vie....

      ok, so today was a red-letter day of sorts- i had not one but two naps.........i got a chance to sleep for about 1 hour after an early lunch- while andrew was getting packed up to back to uk- and to work at k-lair, a grill on uk campus.   i had to get up and take cayle to her soccer game- at which i was glad to have packed a blanket as well as a lawn chair, and a mug of hot tea- it was so cold and damp at dana.........when we got home, i laid down again, only to wake up at 6:30.  i feel marvelous after so much rest- the day is gone but i feel great.  still studying stuff like insulin dosages and such- my test is looming next sat am at U.C.law school in cincinnati.....back to work.....

      ok, so i am a sucker for elvis costello singing the theme song for notting hill- 'she'  i really like that song- so much so that i stayed up last night and watched the movie 'in fast forward mode- just to hear it twice (beginning and end).  now i am exhausted and thinking about skipping church so i can have a little nap before cayle's soccer game.....

      ok, so i got to cook tonight with a chef in training and a self-trained chef- and i enjoyed every minute.....they made a total mess of the kitchen- and scented the air permanently with the smell of fried grease- but the meal was great and the company was good. i will now stack my food rather than arrange it side-by-side..........

      ok, so i got home from work last night to find a cycling/running friend of ecw 'staying over' before the triathalon. presumably someone staying over means that he cannot/willnot stay at home with his wife and family for some reason, which i did not ask about because i did not want to know. i am somewhat troubled by this event- because it appears to have something to do with the triathalon- the time spent in training- running, biking, etc.- some spouses may not tolerate the time spent away from the bosom of the family.  it is quite possible that ecw and i have stayed married 21+ years because we encourage each other to persue personal interests and allow each other the space to do so.  i don't know that i would like him underfoot everywaking moment.......when he is away doing things he loves he always comes back happy, and a happy husband makes for a good relationship....

      ok, so the news at trc today is the movie about the centre/harvard game- Dr. Rousch brought in a dozen or so for lunch including some hollywood types, and they talked of nothing but the plans for the movie-  the only part i caught was the analogie between this movie and field of dreams.......no idea when it will film- or if trc has any shot at getting a credit as caterer.........

      ok, so i bought andrew another coat- my family is collective in their disdain for this action-......just let the boy freeze- it will teach him a lesson- to pay attention where he leaves his coat.......in reality, i am living with a family of coat-losers- to the point that i am surprised that there is no english surname associated with coat-losing- like carter or wheeler or farmer.....coatloser.......ok, so the boy loses coats........so have scw and ccw- i have not lost a coat to my knowledge- i guess it is the age- the young have less ownership when ti comes to personal belongings.....

      ok, so i am on the last moments of my 'vacation' and i have not gotten much rest and relaxation-  andrew pointed out at lunch today that my vacations have always been more frantic than restful- so what was my point?  i attended a workshop on diabetes this morning at st joseph hospital, then took andrew to lunch and for some shopping, then saw 2 clients for dr. hempel, and came home.  not bad for my last vacation day.......i got lost trying to find andrew's dorm- and had to park the car and go in to get him because he had not turned on his cell phone........we ate at j.beth- whereupon i bought stephan another book by the fight club guy- called choke- which the salesperson raved about and told me most of the plot, which i will not reveal hwere in that he told me that it might be too risque for a 15 year old boy.........oh well- i assigned the sun also rises to my spanish travelers, which is risque for people of any age......after lunch i bought andrew yet another coat- which he will certainly lose- he has lost more coats at 18 than i have ever owned in 46 years......i cannot imagine losing something as essential to survival as a coat....he has even lost some of my coats, and his dad's coats............but there he was, shivering in a short sleeve shirt, looking all pitiful and vulnerable.....what is a mother to do.....

      ok, so the mean mamma is back in danville, and so glad of it.  let me just say this about this trip- it made me appreciate people who share a true passion for travel and all that goes with it- drinking in the sights, taking time in museums to get the essense of the exhibits, trying new foods, sitting back and soaking in the culture-  this trip had none of that, alas-  i spent most of my time getting cayle to get up off the of the floor, where she would sit in the midst of crowds because she was bored and had minimal interest in actually reading the signs about the kinds of fish in the tank, or the name of the artist and the work,  or even to peer inside the mummy's coffer.......so let's talk about what i enjoyed about this trip to chicago-  - discovering that the cta now runs from midway downtown- and paying only $3.00 each way to get us 3 blocks from our hotel - seeing the end of the chicago marathon- and getting to take a picture of jeff and karen thornton after he finished in boston-qualifiying time - seeing the picasso model for his unnamed chicago piece that looks like a giant baboon's head- at the art institute - seeing the desk and chair designed by frank lloyd wright for the johnson building in racine, wisconsin- kidney shaped rather than his signature angular - seeing the tang horses at the art institute- i wish i could bring one home - going to shaw's crab shack with the thorntons and having wonderful crab cakes and a nice sauvignon blanc - leaving cayle's almost full juice bottle for the homeless man going through the trach cans outside of the aquarium - seeing a tank of chambered nautilus at the aquarium - seeing the penguin display at the aquarium- one of the best i have ever seen- i could sit there all day just watching - seeing the special exhibit on pearls at the field museum- so many neat things- marilyn monroe's pearls given to her by joe d. on their honeymoon; -still in the case; mary todd lincoln's pearl necklace and bracelets   worn at his inaguration/ his gift to her; washington's gift of pearls to his granddaughter on her marriage;  2 dresses by the french designer worth- all embellished with seed   pearls; a faberge egg with pearl highlights; a portrait of queen elizabeth showing her with ropes of pearls on her dress, in her hair, etc; fossilized pearls; morther-of-pearl   chalices; pearl ornaments worn by egyptian pharohs; the cultured pearl necklace worn by audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffany's; a pearl tiara made for empress josphine;   pearls worn by marie antoinette; pearls belonging to queen victoria; black pearls, pink and gold pearls; a pearlie jacket from london;    a fabulous pearl necklace loaned by elizabeth taylor; a string of pink conch pearls as big as marbles; it just went on and on- i coveted most of what was on display-  - supper at the chinese restaurant in the lobby of our hotel- a nice shrimp lo mein with a chinese beer - watching monk on usa network last night on cable- we don't get cable/will never get cable- but i love this show...also watched cribs on mtv-   anyway- so glad to be home, and still off work till thursday morning......can't wait til spain- i feel that this trip was just practice- a reminder of all that is essential to traveling like packing light; researching all of the open days, holidays, hotel locations, special exhibits, nearby great cafes, etc. even down to the nitty gritty about packing my favorite eye shadow rather than what is in a more convenient package-  i hate the eye shadow in my travel bag but i never remember to take it out between trips.....  on another note- i am counting on the l.o to bring appropriate travel music- i have fond memories of beck's devils hair cut as a backround to being lost north of cologne.......i will try to find out connector to play a cd player on a car tape player...... -

      ok, so I leave for Chicago with Cayle on Sunday morning- early- from Louisville. There are so many things that must be done before I leave- it is tragic- I have already baked 18 loaves of bread and put them in the freezer- as my cohorts fear that it can't be done right by anyone else.  I have a rehearsal dinner on Friday night, and 2 weddings on Saturday, and a dinner on Tuesday night that I will cook ahead for even though I won't be there.......I have discovered that the restaurant in Chicago I really wanted to eat at- Berghoff's- is closed Sundays and holidays- and Monday is Columbus Day- so it will be closed......Thankfully the Art Institute will be open, and I have already purchased tickets for the Aquarium..There is a Chinese place next door to our hotel, and a deep dish pizza place down the block- so I won't starve......

      ok, so i have changed strategies on our barcelona hotel- the hotel jardi has never emailed back so we have moved to the hotel continental- with a triple room with a balcony overlooking the ramblas-  breakfast included.  rick steves says that the wallpaper clashes with the carpet- i will probably feel like i am visiting my grandmother in cleveland.......

      ok, so let's learn some of the foods that i can't wait to try, as pictured in my beautiful dk eyewitness spain book-  amanida- a calalan salad with vegetables,  cheese, and fish or shellfish llagosta i pollastre- catalan lobster and chicken in a tomato/hazelnut sauce truchas a la navarra- mountain trout stuffed with ham and then grilled vieras de santiago- scallops in the shell covered with tomato sauce and grilled  all these foods words remind me of my first trip to europe- in 1972- the month before the munich olympics- my brother and i knew no french or german- so in order to make safe restaurant orders we would point to the 1/2 on the menu- it always meant half of a grilled chicken and fries. not very adventurous- but it worked for me at the time- i fondly remember my father and my cousin, nancy- who lived in paris at the time, and who traveled with us along the loire- arguing over who got the last order of fried brains in a little place in blois.......as if there was any argument.........i know to avoid anything with sesos in the description.........

      ok, so i tried to snack on the leftover hot and sour soup from sunday- and all that remains in the container is the hot part- so hot i choked and spit it out and started to have a coughing fit.  the sad thing about chinese leftovers so that everybody else likes them too, and by tuesday the leftovers from sunday are pretty much picked over.....i have taken to ordering chinese on sunday, because by sunday i am so tired of my own cooking that i don't want any of my own leftovers......... my spanish words of the day.....let me see, how about foods i won't order- cabrito asado- roast goat cochino asado- roast suckling pig congrio- conger eel higado- liver jeta- pig's cheeks tortilla de sesos- brain omelet  i believe that i will keep the word sesos with me forever............

      ok, so my spanish words of the day involve food equipment:      la cuchara; el tenedor; el cuchillo ( spoon, fork and knife.....)  these words may come in handy..... ironically, my darling husband knows the spanish word for beer, from the year he spent in texas as a counselor at a camp for delinquent boys....i guess after a shift with formerly knife-wielding 11-year olds, he needed a cervasa or dos........  I am frustrated because the hotel in barcelona has not emailed back since i requested a reservation on saturday.  i have sent my email again- and hope that i can nail down this initial 3 day-stay......  it must be said that these spanish words are part procrastination- as i take my 5-year diabetes educator recertification exam Oct 26-i really should be studying diabetes medication interactions..........

      ok, so i am trying to learn spanish food words- some we already know- like huevos (eggs), tortilla (which means omelet in spain), jambon (ham) pimiento (pepper) bonito (tuna) pan (bread) cafe (coffee) aquacat (avocado) languostine (small lobster or large shrimp) calamare (calamari) vino (wine) caliente (hot....) pollo (chicken) - with just these words i can eat something.............most of the vegetables have unrecognisable names.......as do most of the fishes, meats, and beverages.....even beer is a different name from what i thought- cervaces (ther-va-thas)  or something like that.....i like biero better but i probably wouldn't get a beer in returno.........good gracious- i hope they do not serve theme beer- like pumpkin beer or pimiento beer in these little tapas places............this could be culinary hell......

      ok, so it gets worse and worse---------it seems that when my great-grandparents went west to get treatment for my great uncle harold who had polio- they rented out the family farm in cleveland to a group of kkk members who used it for-------rituals and such-my aunt and uncle and mother started talking about it tonight when i asked about the house and it's history as a stop on the underground railroad- yes- that is what the stellar family used it for in 1852 when they built the house- but not what it was used for in 1918 when it was rented out.........i knew that a kkk robe had been found when they cleared out my grandparents things- they claim it was my great uncle albert's robe- he was a one-eyed n'er-do-well who worked for the trash collection group in cleveland and who never bathed or cleaned his house- most of our nicer furniture comes from his house (near to the airport), because he moved to a nursing home about the time that ecw and i got married.......they were my greatgrandparent stephan's round dining table, chairs, armoire and bed.........the other inflammatory incident of the night came when my aunt and uncle were telling stories of the old minstrel shows, and pondering why they don't do these anymore- 'they made so much for charity and they were so much fun......"

      ok, so in order to receive emails from these spanish hotels, i must search through my junk mail folder- through the people offering me extra inches, low credit, a quick divorce, and to research the c-w history for free..........the cannons are still firing in perryville, and the republicans- my family- are due any minute for supper.  we are eating outside on the deck- whereupon at least 1 person i am related to will complain that it is - too hot- too dusty- to many leaves- too many acorns,,,,,,just too much......we are eating roast pork loin- apologies to the vegetarians i know- but pork is what my family eats to celebrate- for as long as i can remember. this time i fixed spinach artichoke casserole instead of lima beans......what a rebel...............................

      ok, do it is quite ironic that i have war hawks visiting, while the reacreated battle of perryville is going on. i can hear the distant thunder of cannon- a reminder that 140 years ago over 5000 men were killed not 12 miles from my house- in a single day.  such a waste then, such a waste now.....

      ok, so i have spent my morning trying to book hotel rooms on-line.  we are confirmed thus far at:  Hotel Europa in Madrid (rick steve's first pick) for 3 nights (a triple room) Hotel Sirimiri in Bilbao- a 1 star hotel on the metro line and with easy access to freeway for 2 nights- a triple room  We are awaiting confirmation at:  Hotel Jardi in Barcelona (3 nights) near the Ramblas triple room  Parador at Hondarribia- a restored fortress overlooking both the bay and france- right up there in the corner of spain within a few km of Hendaye, France. I could not find anything in san sebastian- this little town is a few miles north along the coast, and appears to be much smaller and less glamourous/expensive yet more quaint.......The Lonely Planet guidebook described this hotel as a 'treat'.    my word(s) of the day are the good words- buenos dias, buenos tardes, buenos noches- good day, good afternoon, good evening...........  on another note- my family is visiting- my mother's sister and her husband from cleveland, and my long lost brother, stuart, who has not visited in 2.5 years......they will be visiting my dad in the va nursing home at lunch- i will be working and will miss this visit.  i love these people dearly, but these are my republican kin- and ecw and i sometimes have to bite on bullets to keep our opinions to ourselves-we learned long ago that this is an unmovable crowd when it comes to argument so we save our breath.......i suspect at dinner tonight we will hear all about why we need pre-emptive strikes........

      ok, so the word of the day is adios, or goodbye.  i like words that i already knwo- it the new words that i struggle with.  i sat with ecw last night and finished watching ;open your eyes' the original movie in spanish that tom cruise remade with penelope cruz- he needn't have bothered- it ended up very weird indeed- and they memble their spanish so much i could not make out many words, even with subtitles.....

      ok, so it was suggusted to me today, by the l.o.'s mother, that i should adopt winfield frankel's spanish style- add o to the end of all words....... not a bad idea.....if she is the l.o.'s mother, does that make her the mother of all opposition?  excellento...........

      ok, so the word of the day is ola, which means hello- this little gem comes not from the phrase boo, but from watching sesame street- big bird led a spanish class with some of the kids from the neighborhood.......yesterday's word of por favor....i now have 2 phrases under my belt..........

      ok, so speaking of secret hand signal signs, the funniest thing happened today at work- my kitchen assistant is deaf, and the wait staff all hand spell special instructions to him if what they have written on the order may not be clear enough- well, today in the rush of things at lunch, gail started frantically handspelling in sign language her order- to me- which i could not understand because i do not retain sign language in the way that i retain no language but some english.....it was really funny when she realized that she was signing to me.....i apologize for making such a big deal of a sign- but corellia was insistent that she could not hold the ticket.............

      ok, so i survived the 2nd memorial service, attended by my brother and his son, who lives with him in d.c.- as well as my mother's sister from cleveland and her husband and their daughter (1 year younger than me) and her husband and daughter (age 21- the same age as my brother's son).  many of my dad's workmates from osu came, as well as many of their old church friends. several relatives came from dad's side of the family- his oldest sister, and 3 nieces and 1 nephew and their families.  it was a nice service, as these things go- cayle asked where we would go for the next service, and i was relieved to tell her that this was the final event......

      ok, so we made it to cincinnati, and lived through our first encounter with sister elaine since the ecw's mother's funeral. her husband did not come- he stayed with the sister of their oldest son's wife (get the connection) who lives down the street from ecw's sister lisa.  i thought it a might cowardly that mike did not come, as we all knew he was down the street. but it was nice to talk a bit with elaine about spain, and to have her confirm that castillian spanish has many different pronunciations than latin american spanish.....and that the c before an i or e comes out as th........also a doubble ll, like in tortilla comes out with a j sound, like tortija......her 2 daughters were there, and her oldest son and his wife and new baby......they didn't come until after ecw's brother jim and his wife left for their house in gatlinburg for th weekend......ah well....today we venture north to my home town, for the second and last memorial service.  i will be seeing all of my ohio relatives on both sides of the family, as well as a few school friends of my own...a very few.....i am not the sort who keeps up with just anybody... i have made a point over the years to keep up with only those people who i really like and hope to actually see again......therefor, my address book is not crowded with people i barely remember and cannot really place anymore.......there are really good utlets on the way there-  maybe we can stop on the way home.....a visit to eddie bauer or gap or ralph lauren would really make my weekend......

      ok, so someone in my family has erased all the email addresses in the handy pull-down menu- the one that lists all of the recently visited addresses.  i often use this menu to go back to frequently visited locations rather than typing in the addresses each time. someone must have visited locations too sensitive for family viewing- and erased all trace. ironically, i would not have noticed nor would i have actually visited nonfamiliar addresses- it is the only the absence of any addresses that makes mean mamma suspicious......yes, this family member could have visited princess diana sites, or michael jackson sites, but somehow i doubt that the string of sites would have been this interesting.....  we are leaving for cincinnati in a few hours- for lunch with ecw's sister lisa and brother james, and maybe a drive-by visit by sister elaine, the one who made such a hullabuloo at the funeral over the will. i would actually like to talk to her, as she is the only one in the family who speaks spanish (she has a degree in spanish, no less) and once visited spain in college (wearing mix-and-match drip-dry wardrobe made by my mother-in-law that i heard about on numerous occassions over the past 21 years........) i would feel badly visiting spain without consulting with her, even if briefly, on our itinerary.  speaking of speaking spanish,  my own personal dialect coach is getting on my last nerve over pronunciation of spanish words- i have been using the dk spanish tapes, which pronounces c with a th sound- words like barcelona come out barthelona......- at least according to my tapes.  there is one in my midst who disputes that the th rather than c pronunciation is spain-wide- maybe only in catalonia.......and describes my attempts at spanish words with a c as lisping.......anyway- i want my sisterinlaw to clear up this whole lisping spanish thing.........  i am bringing a relish tray- with all of my favorite crudites.  the jar of pickled okra has been opened (not by me) but once opened- i haven't been able to resist. i love pickled okra. i hope no one in my family blabs that there would have been pickled okra on the tray if not for the mean mamma....... maybe santa will bring a jar or two for my stocking.    ah well, here's to a happy thanksgiving for you and yours.........

      ok, so this week i have noticed that i am in a decided 'time slot' when i drive the children to school. i tend to see the same person pulling out of candlewood, the same truck and cars waiting at the light at boone trail and lex-ave, the same cars dropping off at jenny rogers, etc.  if my timing varies by 2-3 minutes either way, i cross-over into unfamiliar sights- i see a father and his two daughters from cayle's swim team coming out of the apt building at 4th and walnut on their way to woodlawn, only if i am running late.   i see the new emh ceo walking around the hospital- making rounds?- only if i am running early.  i know that i am running early, on time, or late by these markers, not just by the clock and the npr radio cadence...... to get cayle to school before the tardy bell i must be at the stanford road light before the morning business report comes on.......all of this time slot talk reminds me of my favorite bar in cincinnati- the blind lemon in mt adams.  it was around the corner from the apt i shared with a friend from grad school.  we would go for happy hour every friday from 5-7, and order 2 beers each, and have pretzels while we played backgammon.  the bartender would automatically get out the board and pour our beers when we walked in- the price was always the same, so we knew how many single bills to take along. we got to know some of our neighbors, who also came for friday happy hour. .....once- on a double date, we went in on saturday night.  we didn't know a soul-- not the bartender, not the waitresses, none of the crowd was familiar- the bartender didn't even know they had a backgammon board because no one ever asked for it on his shift....what a difference a time slot makes.....

      ok, so we leave for spain 1 month from sunday......i am so fortunate to be traveling with such knowledgable and witty companions- i especially look forward to my personal dj who brings such an eclectic mix of music to long car trips (we will have 2.....)  i have to hunt up the cd player adapter for the car's casette slot from the last trip.  there are few people i would welcome on a european adventure- but the loyal opposition is not your usual 15 year old- i admire her sense of self and her independence and her willingness to listen to me repeat myself with good humor......

      ok, so my alma mater is one game closer to winning a national championship. Ohio State beat Michigan 14-9 in a nail-biter game yesterday afternoon in its signature horseshoe stadium. so sweet.   of course, i did not see the actual ending, as i had to go to work- that is probably why they won- because i wasn't watching. i hadn't watched a game all season (mostly because osu games aren't aired around here......) i musn't jinx the team by watching jan 3- regardless, a national title would be abittersweet memorial for my dad, the ultimate osu fan. i have many fond memories of attending osu games with him- stopping for mcdonalds lunch on the way, which was a treat then- we NEVER stopped for fast food unless we were on vacation or going to a football game.  we would proceed from the parking 'field' to st john's arena where we would listen to the band warm-up- then on to the game.  i remember seeing the osu-michigan game with my dad when woody hayes was still coaching, and the stadium was going to astroturf- after the game (osu won...) the students took down the goalposts and carried them down high street- and the alums took out shovels and trash bags and literally scooped up the playing field as souveniers(sp)...........everybody wanted a little bit of osu turf for their own yards......remarkable.  i did get to see osu beat michigan in ann arbor- when i was in grad school and dating a boy who went to grad school at michigan.....michigan has a bottle law- so after the game- people got out trash bags and started picking up cans and bottles to get back the deposits- it was a remarkable thing to see........

      ok, so there is a bright side to a funeral- all of the nice cards and letters.  i look forward to the mail, because every day seems to bring another bundle of tender words and thoughtfulness.  i received an unexpected note from a boy i haven't seen since i was in the 5th grade- he read dad's obit in the Millersburg, Ohio Daily Record. i was born in millersburg ohio, and occassionally feel melancholy about the move away- anyway, i was able to put my hands on a picture of max miller within 5 minutes of reading the note-  it seems that the year i got my first camera- for my birthday in 1967- i brought it to school, and took pictures of my friends on the playground- his was the first, and so he has been the first photo in my first album for the past 35 years........he was just adorable then- i wonder how he has grown up.  anyway, it was nice for him to write....i think of millersburg and elementary school whenever the assassination of jfk comes up- i was in the second grade and can see clearly the classroom, and the shock that came over us when the announcement came over the loadspeaker, and we were instructed to go home for the rest fo the day......it ended up being several days, as i watched the funeral procession on tv at home........i will always feel a  special bond to people i was with on that day- our generations 9-11, of sorts.

      methodist church thursday 3:30 with visitation after.  stephan has selected a place to plant a tree in grandpa's memory. we would like to plant a buckeye tree- no idea if these trees are available in a non-buckeye state.  i do like the idea of having a buckeye tree, though.  especially if osu wins the national championship- dad would have been so happy.......

      ok, so we will probably have a service thursday at the methodist church in danville, to give us closure- and have another service thanksgiving weekend in mt gilead with mom's ohio friends to give her closure.  closure is essential, i believe, in the healing process- no matter how many times i say that it was a blessing. it isn't a blessing until i find closure.

      ok, so my father passed away this morning at 9:08 am. my mother was with him, as the v.a. called her when the shift started to tell her that she had better come on if she wanted to be with him.  she was there to hold his hand until the end.  there is comfort in that small act- having someone be with you until the end.  as for the rest of us- we have occupied the time since we got the call with busy work- ecw is raking leaves, and i am putting away the summer clothes and cleaning out closets. when in doubt- clean out...........he will be going directly to be cremated, as i understand it, and she will schedule a memorial aservice at her home church in ohio at some date ot be announced.  this arrangement goes off the board in terms of timing- and we are left without any idea how to grieve.....be in prayer for us.

      ok, so i waited inline for nearly an hour to get tickets to see harry potter chamber of secrets.  the wait in line was almost as good as the movie- one meets a random crowd while waiting- and this wait was worth mentioning.  for starts, the couple with a 6 year old in front of me all wore danville admiral clothing- though they live in houstonville and the child does not go to danville schools. the mother in this grouping used to work at joseph-beth, and quit because they only paid a max of $10 and hour and only gave 10% discount on books.  she had to pass a test to qualify to work there, which is encouraging in terms ofjust who tells us where to find certain books....... she knows an author in georgia who writes cozy mysteries involving show dogs..........the woman just in back, with 2 children about 7 or so saw 8-mile while her children saw harry potter- but the harry potter film broke during the 10:00 showing and they came and watched the end of 8-mile with her..........which did not seem to bother her that her young ones saw anything of eminem's movie.  she was only bothered to have to come back today for them to see the rest of harry potter.  i let an aquaintance cut inline with me, when she announced that she was wanting tickets to santa clause 2- her children go the the christian school and she could not be seen taking them to harry potter..... satan connections, you know-- she actually said this-----though she did admit to reading the first book secretly!!!!!!!!!and to having seen the first harry potter on video- she admitted that it didn't seem too satanic to her, but the school was quite clear about its stance on the books and films........that kind of bologna gives christianity a bad name........curiously, everyone in this little enclave had seen aerosmith in concert except me.........don't even ask me how this came up.....it was a long wait........oh, yea- the second movie was scarier than the first edition......now i can't wait to see the second edition of the lord of the rings.......i wonder how long i will wait for those tickets..........

      ok, so ernst. cayle, stephan and i went up to the v.a. home in wilmore this evening to see my dad.  his bed is on the floor, so he cannot fall out too far. the bed is bent up at the head so that he is really sitting up to help him breathe. he is totally unconcious- with his mouth open so he can breathe in the oxygen from his mask.  his eyes flickered a bit when i first spoke to him, but he never opened his eyes nor acknowledged our presence.  he is quite warm with fever- he looked so pitiful it was all that we could do to say our goodbyes without sobbing.  the end cannot be far away- his passing will be a blessing, as they say.......

      ok, so i have been listening to the nanny diaries on tape- as read by julia roberts.  this book is escapist at best- and i thoroughly enjoyed a peak into the lives of the rich and too busy/too important to raise their own children.  the'x'family mother and father are so totally wrapped up in their looks, prestige, money, clothes, etc. that they basically delegate all care of their precious 4 year old son to poorly paid help- a series of housekeepers,nannies and the like.  the nanny who narrates is finishing her senior year at nyu- and was to work parttime for the family while completed her remaining coursework.  julia roberts could have played the title role in the inevitable movie were the title character not 21 years old. even julia would have a hard time pulling off the 21 year-old thing at this point in her career.  nevertheless- it was fun to listen to her read the story and picture her playing the character in the movie- it is such a julia roberts role.

      ok, so here are 5 things that i really admire about my dad- Herbert Wayne Crown:  - he expected not only that i would graduate from college, but also that i would earn a graduate degree, just like he did. i have a picture- taken with my little instamatic- of his master's degree ceremony at osu- as well as a picture of me wearing his mortarboard.it wore a red checked dress with a red flounce at the bottom- bad choice-  but i was only 8 or 9 at most at the time......he was so proud of my master's degree.   there is something to be said for high expectations. sometimes children actually live up to them......he never really knew that i took a major life risk in quitting my miserable job and starting a restaurant- i hope he would have applauded the gumption it took.......  - he believed that there is no finer endeavor than travel.  he reached ' all the 50 states and 14 foreign countries' - quite a mark to match.  i can recall my grandmother crown (who never learned to drive)-on the occassion of a visit after a major trip- asking my dad if he was done with traveling. he told her that that there was a whole lot more to see and that he wouldn;'t stop until he saw it......not bad for a farm boy from ohio.  - he believed that every road should be 'gone down' once.  he really liked the challenge of travel by instinct- he would take maps- but he also enjoyed going down roads just to see where they let out......i rarely saw him get lost.  i would like to say that i inherited his sense of direction- but lightening would strike.............  -he valued the written word.  i fondly recall him sitting in 'his chair' doing the crossword puzzle- in pen- with no mistakes. he also played a mean game of scrabble......  -he believed totally in recycling- both organic and nonorganic matter. his compost pile was enviable...... he also donated gallons of blood in his lifetime- the ultimate in recycling, i believe........  i can forgive him his conservative politics, i suppose.......with those 5  attributes in his plus column...........i would like to think that i could deliver a eulogy- but i am not sure that i could manage it- without choking up-

      ok, so my father appears to be in his final stage of alzheimer's, and enduring his final days.  He cannot swallow liquids or thickened things, and has become dehydrated. dehydration has led to pneumonia, which i fear will be his end.  he has gone 'downhill' so quickly in the past few months- from sitting up and eating a meal- to fetal position with his eyes clenched shut...so sad.  i can remember visiting both of my broughton grandparents, and my grandmother crown in nursing home shortly before they passed on- each was verbal and somewhat lucid- though my grandmother broughton kept crying to go home, which was so awful to hear.........my grandfather broughton told me that he stopped speaking german because his mother told him he had to choose whether he was going to be a german or an american....i told him that i regretted that i never heard him speak german.  grandpa broughton was lucid til the end-blind- but lucid.......he regretted dying in the nursing home despite hsi pleas to dy in his own house-  i hear that occassionally my cousin (who inherited the house) and her family see him- or smell his cigar- i think that he haunts their house as a payback..........  i regret that my mom moved dad from our hometown to live near us- because people who knew and loved my dad are unlikely to make a 5 hour drive to a funeral-  i believe that he deserves better than to have a few close family members at his service after a life of good works and numerous friends. mother has spoken of having a memorial service at their home church after the funeral. i hope that that happens- especially for her to be able to have closure with so many of their ohio friends.  i also hope that both my brother and his son jason make it home for any services.  i have not seen jason for maybe 8-9 years.  sometimes funerals are good for mending fences and retying connections..... keep my dad in your prayers......

      ok, so i ran into a person i wish i knew better outside the library- she asked me if i was pleased about the election, and i charged into a diatribe about i wished that gatewood had beaten ernie and how i wish lois had beaten whatshisname and how i wished that i could have voted for school board.....and she told me that she had mistakenly voted straight democratic ticket (there is a button for this) and therefore missed out ont he chance to vote for gatewood. she said that she gets more and more liberal as she gets older and that she is from a republican family and sees them get more conservative as the years pass.....i started laughing, because she could be me when it comes to her politics-it was refreshing to know that i am not out there on a limb all by myself- there are others who have similar views...... of ocurse, i think she really wanted to talk about wet/dry- but i no longer discuss that issue- there is too much work and anxiety involved when it ocmes to liquour l.

      ok, so people are coming out of the woodwork- volunteering to help us select wine for our new wine menu.............not that we necessarily require hand-holding. both jerry and i like to drink wine, and we have favorites that we would want to include. i like australian chardonnay- i think it is buttery and golden and just lucious.  i hope we can serve one that is not too expensive by the glass.  yes- by the glass- we cannot actually sell bottles- it has to be by the glass.......maybe this will be a good thing- people may try a $5 glass of australian white when they wouldn't have purchased a $20 bottle.........i am also keen on alsatian reislings.....yum yum.....maybe a will like spanish reds, ya never know.....

      ok ,so an analyst on npr yesterday has predicted that the country will swing back to the left of center in 2008- seems like a long, long time- almost as long as the dismal reagan years.....

      ok, so this wet/dry thing has been overshadowed by a disastrous election- how could georgia voters fail to re-elect mr .cleland (a vet who lost his limbs in veit nam) when his opponent claimed he was soft on defense..........people with their heads in the sand vote republican.......people who care only about themselves fail to vote in the first place......i am terribly embarraed that my eldest child- when able and registered to vote- failed to vote. he has also failed to register for the draft and will surely be indicted on felony charges anyday soon.  we may have to visit him in canada.........

      ok, so we celebrated around the corner- through the precinct by precinct reporting on the radio- danville has gone wet in restaurants seating more than 100. owning such a restaurant- i am scared to death- of all the work that goes into maintaining a 70/30 split and all the work to train people to work shifts so that i can stay home some of the time.  i cannot see myself working 15 hour days every day, i will not be serving alcohol on sundays because i will not be working on sundays.........oh my........i really didn't see this coming.......

      ok, so i teach at eku at 6:00, but after that ecw and i will attend the annual election party at our friends the trents around the corner- where we drink to those who won- if they are democrat- and to those who lost- especially if they are democrat- and even call up republican friends to give them grief- we actually haven't done that since the dismal reagan years and the clinton victory.....- but you just never know how this vote will turn out. it is either ironic or just desserts that most of our friends are democrats- we tolerate a few 'token' republicans to say that we are equal opportunity.........we have been gathering on election night for the past 20 years-that is a lot of elections, and a lot of beer..........gentle readers under the legal drinking age- do not attempt such a gathering until you actually 1) vote on a regular basis 2) are lucky enough to find such an enclave of liberal-minded friends.

      ok, so it took me all of 7-8 minutes to park my car, walk into the polling place, sign in, vote and walk out.  there was no line- i didn't expect one- as the county has no real issues on the line.  i did vote for gatewood galbreath, by the way, because i will not vote republican and because i believe that ernie fletcher gives all ernies a bad name- he is no ernie- ernies are sincere, gentle souls-this ernie is a medically trained snake in the grass.....my business partner had to wait 45 minutes in line- in a danville city precinct- a good sign- lots of people came out to vote even in the rain.  i think that the presence of the delcaration of independence in danville at this very moment to be quite prophetic- something important is about to happen- i can feel it......

      ok, so i am going to get dressed and go to vote on the way to work. i heard a disturbing piece on npr about the apathy of the 18-24 year old voters- who seem to think that if they don't vote they won't therefore be responsible for the sorry state of affairs in america- or they don't care about the issues, or they are just too lazy to find out about the issues- needless to say, it was quite discouragiong to hear that less than 20% of eligible voters may turn out today, and the % of the young will be miniscule.  acw is registered- i will be quite shocked if he shows up to vote today. ecw just got back from voting- he said that the polls were not crowded at all.  he was shocked to find that my dad is still on the rolls as eligible despite being in a nursing home and quite senile.....my mother tried to vote FOR him in the last election, but was denied on this request.........there is stioll some justice in america....

      ok, so i am still upset that my minister chose to discuss his intended vote from the pulpit yesterday.  Dr. Thomas Valentine broke with tradition, and disclosed that he would vote no tomorrow, after great soul-searching and prayer.  He breaks tradition, in that our doctoral-trained clergy have alwats maintained that ones vote is private and they have traditionally been silent from the pulpit.  when the lottery came around- no word from the pulpit was uttered. i was somewhat shocked yesterday- though he did concede that many in our church would vote wet........i really would have preferred that he keep his vote behind the booth curtain.......

      ok, so i had a guy come into the kitchen to ask for a job this afternoon- he smelled so strongly of marijuana he must have jettisoned his joint just before entering trc-  the sad thing was- he was probably older than me-  so much for getting more sensible as time passes ........gentle readers- no one will hire you if you smell like dope- and you proably wouldn't want to work anywhere that would actually hire you under those circumstances.........

      ok, so the trip to spain is on a countdown- less than 60 days.......i am starting to obsess about details- rereading confirmations of hotel reservations, print out driving instructions- worry that 5.5 hours from barcelona to hondarrribia is a long time in the winter- when will it get dark- how early should we start......that sort of thing. i have read through the 'graffiti wall' on european travel hosted by rick steves- our hotels in mardrid and barcelona come recommended by rick steve reader as well as by rick himself-- this much is good.  i have cut and pasted many of the restaurant picks for us to try- especially the vegetarian and/or seafood ones.  for some odd reason- no comments on spanish cuisine were from the basque area- rick steves doesn't cover it either- we must be going completely outside the box to travel to this neck of the woods............i like the idea of tapas, which can be ordered by pointing-  i cannot locate my spanish phrase book- i may be poiting regularly on this trip......one last comment about the travel posting boards- i read one man's post about a trip he just returned from (10/30) to italy on which he put regular gas into his diesel rental car.......done that- will never do that again.......

      ok, so its friday night and i don't work either saturday or sunday......so i have stayed up late eating smoked sausages and warm lentil salad because it is so good and i cannot believe that few if any others in danville share my passion for this combination.......to his credit=- dr. goodwin had this dish tonight whilst his wife margo had the chicken- nothing i served tonight was as delectable as the warm lentil salad..... ok so just how adventurous will i be on this trip to spain- will i eat roast head of veal? probably not........i have spurned fried brains in front of my favorite kin, and i have no problem spurning them again......my mother is speaking to me-surprising considering the suv test drive she made by the restaurant that i thoroughly disrupted.......women with husbands in nursing homes have no business test driving suv's.........i do feel sorrry for my mother- as my dad always traded in his old gm car for a new one every 2 years, and had a perpetual car payment- my mother has no car payment now. and has no need for one........i am sure that she misses the new car smell........

      ok, so after dropping stephan off at school i saw this girl walking toward school, wearing a black cape and outfit, with whitish makeup and black lipstick- and my first thought was....halloween is over- and then it occured to me that this is one of those goth(ic) people who live in permanent halloween- like extras for rocky horror picture show waiting for a remake to break out in need of people who already look the part...truly bizarre- in my day, we didn't have goths- just people who wore hippy beads, peace sign belt buckles, long stringy hair and bell-bottoms that were too long and in tatters......maybe an american flag t-shirt or a tye-dye number........and granny glasses......somehow this image is more optimistic and almost joyous compared to the black-robed people of the night.....the hippie wanna-bes of my day just wanted legalized dope and free love.........and to give peace a chance......

      ok, so mean mamma is going out tonight, wearing her new discount duds- quitea snazzy new outfit i must say....won't be dragging this blouse (white cotton) to spain as it will look like i slept in it after the first 5 minutes.....i have packed more than i should take- i will surely remove a few items before tomorrow at 10:00 (our leaving the house time...) i am taking hummus and an eggplant dip to the party we are attending...not quite spanish food, but in the neighborhood.  new years day will NOT mark 1 year of blogging- we must wait til spring for that milestone.....i do resolve in 2003 to blog less and exercise more.......

      ok, so i am down  to the wire- just 24 hours til we have to leave the house, and so much to do.....i have made the appetizer i am taking to a nyeve party, so that is one thing down, i have also bought film, borrowed my mom's camera, taken clothes and stuff to the goodwill, and cleaned out the freezer.  i have also figured out my 2nd choice security system for when it is too warm to wear my raincoat with the nifty inside zipper pocket.........  the c-w's had their champagne early- at supper last night- to celebrate the payoff of their mortgage-  it will seems strange to no longer have a mortgage payment- but a welcome strangeness.....one of my lottery fantasies involved paying off the house, now i will have to adjust my fantasy somewhat- maybe pay off friend's mortgages as a surprise.....like a modernday robin hood.....ah well, we can do whatever we want in our fantasy lives......

      ok, so i think i have a cold, and i am already starting to worry that i will feel miserable on the plane and in barcelona.....however, i still have today and tomorrow to stock up on  nyquil and tissues.....so many things i want to get done before we go...clean out the freezer, take old clothing to the goodwill,  get tax stuff together, put photos in albums (i am 2 years behind, maybe 3) i will be happy if i get any of it done.  acw has also asked that i put together another list of songs for a second burned cd mix- here it is so far-  carole king tapestry & you got a friend,  joni mitchell california and free man in paris, led zep kashmir and stairway to heaven, bob dylan forever young and like a rolling stone, david bowie changes, csn&y suite judy blue eyes & southern cross, dan fogelburg since you've asked & part of the plan, karla bonoff home, allison krouse when you say nothing at all.....not a one less than 5 years old- mostly 25+ but, then we don't get cable so i don't watch mtv or vh1, etc. and i only really listen to npr news and/or world cafe sometimes on the way home from catering a late party....ecw's siblings were all in amazement that we don't get cable- confounded that someone related to them could have little interest in watching enough television to make the price worthwhile...yes- i would like to see many things that a&e produce, but my mom tapes them for me......in our cable-free world, we have many evenings without the tv on at all and family members are forced to do something else, like read.....or blog.......

      ok, so we went to cincinnati for lunch with ecw's brother jim and 2 of his sisters, and their families. after lunch conversation started to fade, i decided to lay down on the couch in the 'other' tv room, and watch what was on- mtv video countdown, then the top 20 most memorable moments on mtv for 2002. i actually enjoyed the top 20 moments, as i had never seen any of the real worlds, or the osbournes, or trl, or the mtv awards......nor any of the videos for that matter......such a shielded life i lead....anyway i did enjoy the scene with sharon osbourne throwing the ham over the fence at the neighbors, whilst  in her pajamas.....i was also intrigued by this avril person- she sounded like an alanis morrisette clone...except that alanis' lyrics were not so precictable....nor so insipid...finallyscw came  in and told me i was rude for not sitting with the other grownups talking about life and death issues...so i walked away from et on mtv.....

      ok, so since mean mamma is 'off' til the restaurant reopens 1/20/03, she is deternined to complete some nesting chores that would otherwise not happen during the normal work year......a sofa and a loveseat have been sent out to be recovered, several drawers have been cleaned out, and a few wallpapering projects have been sketched out.....the first one- the kitchen happened because the fabric for the sofa in the back room clashed with the current paper. yes, these things are not in the same room, but theyare quite visible to the flow of things, and so mm pulled the old paper off the walls and put up a nice stripe- the job tool only 1 roll- which mm purchased for a whopping $5...............alas, everyproject has it's downside-  when i pulled out the refrigerator to clean underneath and to strip the paper behind it, i musthave pulled loose the connection to the icemaker.......about the time ecw got home from work the kitchen was flooded in a lucy ricardo sort of way.........oh my.........having a handy husband is a good thing.......we had time to make chinese after cleaning up......yes make chinese....we made hot and sour soup, a shrimp and veggie lo mein and eggrolls using a chinese cookbook by a certain madame woo passed downfrom ecw's mother.  nothing i made tasted quite like chinese takeout, but it was edible and hot and may be practice will make perfect.  for starts, my eggrolls were the size of small burritos- i did enjoy the  tofu- both in the soup andin the lo mein.....we don't cook tofu often enough.....  i am blogging rather than studying my sunday school lesson- this is a problem in that today is my turn to teach......ecw has decided to go to mass this morning....we will miss church to get to his brother's luncheon cincinnati on time.....he has not been to mass since his mother's funeral- in fact he has only gone to mass at funerals for at least 15 years- when we settled on a church......the reasons that i won't go to the catholic church will not be disclosed in this forum......and predate the current scandals.....

      ok, so after an entire day in lexington, mm came home with only the following: a mini-hairdryer ($9) a pair of drop earrings ($1), a pair of black brushed cotton pants ($17) a white cotton blouse meant to be worn out rather than tucked in ($16)  replacement spanish phrase book (i never reveal what i spend at jbeth.......)  and a flannel nightshirt ($16) i will be packing all of these items into my suitcase, of course. the flannel nightshirt may be overkill, but after last year's trip i would rather be too hot than too cold...  the conversation was, of course, the human cloned baby- by the group that believes that all humans are alien clones...i find this laughable- that short overweight aliens decided to make make identical reproductions of themselves in northern europe....to be slowly descended into my personal gene pool.....we did here this interesting songwriter/poet in worldcafe named lizzie west, who wrote a book of poetry(self-discovery style) then published 1000 copies with her own money, then took off with a filmmaker and her dog to sing in small clubs and promote it as well as make a cd and a documentary.......her words sounded better than her actual singing voice, in  my humble opinion.....  speaking of dogs, i finished the lewis and clarke book for my bookclub's 1/14/03 meeting. i was shocked to discover that the expedition ate as many dogs, purchased from indians, as they did elk and buffalo.......they also had to contend with indian mothers selling their daughters to them for 'favors' as well as a ritualized buffalo hunt ceremony in which warriors offered up their naked wives to the tribe elders, as well as the white visitors under the impression that power and/or wisdom can be transferred by sex- through the female partner....i.e.....if the female partner has sex with the wise tribal elder, then with her warrior spouse, all of the elder's wisdom is transferred to the warrior.........one of l&c's group reportedly transferred power 4 times that evening.......of course, the tribe already had syphillis caught from french fur traders, so the expedition had to go on a remedy based on a mercuric compound.......oh my... i don't recall the time cover article detailing this particular episode.....also intriguing was the whiskey situation- the group took 100 barrels along, and still managed to run out before reaching the mouth of the columbia.....so much for 'we did it all without alcohol......'

      ok, so i cleaned out drawers today- and actually threw away beauty products that were older than my children. i did save a few things for cayle- in pale colors that would not resemble clown-face if overdone.....but mostly i shaved the drawer by half-  this chore was actually part of my pre-packing ritual- i had to see just what i had that was small in size. turns out that we no longer have any sample-size shampoo, or deodorant, or toothpaste- BUT we have 4 bottles of sample size conditioner......i did find a pair of gold earings i bought in Williamsburg when i finished grad school- nice gold studs with my initials engraved- i thought i had lost them.....finding them again is like a present.....

      ok, so it is back  to reality. i finally located my book club book, and have resolved to finish it before i leave for spain, as it weighs several pounds and it is not vacation reading- undaunted courage is about the lewis and clark expedition, the material thus far has been interesting, but at the same time pages of chock-full of information tend to read like text books........i am on page 100 and they haven't reached st louis yet......i HAVE learned that lewis left several gaps in his writing- some lengthy- many weeks to many months....in a  blogging sense, the service would cut off an inactive account with gaps like that......there are theories that there are, infact, missing journals that may yet come to light.....but lewis never mentioned in letters losing any such journals..writers block has also been mentioned as a possibility- thatand he was simply too depressed to write. according to the book, he returned with ample ink and paper......

      ok, so mean mamma is blogging and listening to her cd-mix (along with ecw's mic) RATHER than watch  stuart little 2 on dvd. she is also 1500+ in the hole on solitare, but that is only a problem if this were real money.... i marvel at the insight that went into these mixes- it is as if acw took mental note of every song i have ever said i loved....scw gave me lavender things, another favorite of mine....on the other hand, my own mother gave me a striped turtleneck eerily like one she gave me in 1973 that i also disliked intensely......scw tried to warn her that i wouldn't like it, he told me later, but she wouldn't have any of that.......how can someone i have known all of my life know me so little?  that is a question that therapy wouldn't begin to touch, so i will leave it at that........my partner and my husband gave me a gifts almost identical- which means each pays attention...they are different enough to keep both, happily.......  at this point in the blog, mean mamma will disclose the things she bought for herself while buying for others.....a lovely set of french toile-print desk accessories in burgundy and cream (and the reverse)- a standup file, notecards, several picture albums and a journal.  had my family seen them first, each would have exclaimed....oh my, mamma would just love these.......but alas, scw had his hands full during that visit to marshall's and no one else was there.. i was obliged to buy them from my loving family, in abstentia........now all i have to do is clean off my desk and they will look lovely.....

      ok. so mm got up early on xmas morning to stuff the stockings (santa can't think if everything, you know.....)  and now she is thinking about going back to bed fora bit.....sleep is a gift that we can give ourselves everynight- if only we would organize ourselves to take advantage.  i resolve in 2003 to get more sleep..yea,yea,yea, its a bit early for resolutions, but sleep is on my mind now.....  i have just returned from letting the dogs back in- there is a dusting of snow, and i am happy that i do not have to go anywhere for the next few days unless i really wanna......i may be FORCED to go back to jbeth for a spanish phrase book, as mine has disappeared despite days of searching. therick steves spain book has also disappeared, i may just copy down a few things from the older version at the library. now that christmas is here i must really start getting ready for spain- digging out the suitcases, plotting a minimal wardrobe, printing  out driving instructions, finishing the itinerary.......we received a new set of tickets in the mail yesterday-i have not yet compared them with the old for changes..i have read recently that the gugenheim closed its little las vegas 'hall' in order to financially retrench.  i trust that they will not close the bilbao site, or at least not until we have toured it.....  last night at supper (peel&eatshrimp and crab legs) no one talked about dad, though i am sure that everyone was thinking about dad.  mother always counted out his shrimp- she read a specific portion of shrimp on a low cholesterol diet once and stuck to it despite my protestations....the  last time he was with it enough to be with us on christmas eve, she had to peel his shrimp for him, as he couldn't remember how to do  it.....we did not go to church last night for christmas eve service-  everybody was tired, and even that reminded us of dad- one year when stuart was home we had to go in 2 cars.  after it was over, we all piled into different cars, and no one really counted heads in either car-  we got home to discover that dad was in neither car.........luckily the pastor had gone up to his office to sit by the phone- assuming that someone would call and claim this semi-senile  gentleman.........dad was with it enough to say-' no harm, no foul' when we apologized.......we still chuckle about the christmas when we forgot dad....  mean mamma would like to wish all of her gentle readers a very  happy holiday season, especially sister sheila in colorado- i have written down your travel advice in my little notebook, and we will surely raise a toast in your honor while we are in barcelona.  if sparkling wine comes up on this trip, we will also toast to mamma's friend jane, whose  joie de vivre is always so much more so with a bit of bubbly.....

      ok, so i have been wrapping books for the past hour-nothing but books, with a few cd's and dvd's mixed in- that is all my beloved family unit  wanted, and that is what they are getting.....amazing how little wrapping paper is needed for books, cut it close and there is little leftover paper to fold into the last turn before taping.......i could ahve gotten a box for each person, and wrapped just one present per head, but that defies the age-old numbers game that children live for on holidays' 'she has more presents than me......i can hear it all now......

      ok, so i felt so blessed lucky today that i bought a powerball ticket on the way home from the 'office' christmas party- by office i mean my work mates at trc- and we ate......all the stuff from the refrigerator and freezers that might not make it till 1/20/03- we had baked brie, steamed shrimp, sliced tenderloin (mostly rare) barbequed meatballs, among other things.  there was also a big bowl of leftover coleslaw- but we look at this everyday, and nobody was really gunning to take any of that home.....i am on my way to a long-winters ....nap.......then i will test the newly installed water heater with a shower.......

      ok, so the c-w's are just plain lucky folks.  this morning about 4:15 ecw awoke to smells of putrid smoke, and discovered the basement waterheater aflame........luckily nothing else was likewise burning, and he was able to contain the disaster.  the plumbers seem perplexed on the duelelectrical wires coming out of the top- despite the sticker on the side that says that their company installed this unit.......we have been informed that they will return with a new unit, but that we may want to call an electrician to wire it in........maybe we will all be able to take a shower for christmas...we are only a fews hours into a 'day without a shower' but already i feel out of sorts and cranky.....

      ok, so the mean mamma has a soft place in her heart for christmasletters- personal ones are better, but since i don't even do that other than a short note ont he bottom of a longer xeroxed copy- i will not complain in this forum........i received a BATCH of cards today from most of my favorite people- which reminds me that i have yet to send out the cards that i wasn't sure on newest address- i have also not sent the card to germany to edwin and anna- have also just located that address.......it hardly seems like a year since we landed in brussels and drove down to strasbourg....etc......i would like to go back to amsterdam some day.....we didn't have enough time there...

      ok, so most of the family went to see two towers yesterday.......for starts, the sequel is thoroughly designed for people who have read the books AND seen the fellowship of the ring- i am not sure that the movie's plot line can be followed by anyone totally unfamiliar with the underlying story. alas, the story has been changed more in the second movie than the first. mean mamma spent time last night with the second book confirming her memory versus the movie.  the rearrangement of the role of farramir made no sense and only seemed to prolong the already 'too-long' movie.  i did enjoy the portrayal of the kingdom of rohan- very norse-  many scenes from the second book must have been saved for the third  movie-  the arrival  of aragorn at isengard, with pippin and merry guarding the gate- too funny for jackson to leave out all together- must be coming next christmas.....as well as the bit with the spider in the cave and sam remembering the light of eirendil.....most memorable in this installment are the battle scenes- which are faithful interpretations of medieval warfare, with the storming of the battlements, ramming of the gate, etc. there was also a tender moment between aragorn and his (new) horse that was unexpectingly sweet- of course, when meanmamma actually said this during the movie- she was immediately told to BE QUIET by her kin

      ok, so i finally came up with the mean mamma chant-------it came to me in a flash driving home from church based on the oral discourse.....meanmammagetsherwaymeanmammagetsherwaymeanmammagetsherway.........i guess you had to be there.......of course,mean mamma got her way only on the smallest of issues, but it was her way, nonetheless.......  i oversaw (not overheard) a troubling interchange between a friend and her college-age daughter in an suv stopped at a traffic light- the mother was obviously screaming at the daughter, along with hand gesticulations, while the daughter simply hung her head......the interchange was a wake-up call for my future...there cannot be many instances so pressing that i must 'correct' a child in this sort of public display......certainly what has to be said can wait until you get home, and surely it can be said without theatrics.....

      ok, so i work monday then i am off til january 20- well- kind of, because there will be lots to do the week before we reopen in order to actually open back up...so really i am only off til monday the 14th. i will be doing things like repainting shelves and the kitchen floor...the stuff that never gets done any other time except when we are closed.  i have great hopes of re-wallpapering the upstairs bathroom and the kitchen- maybe in the same pattern, stripes on cream backround that goes with everything up and down.... its on the sale rack at jordan's and buying all they have at $5 a roll will kill '2 birds with one stone' as they say....i have also called an upolsterer about the front room loveseat and the backroom sofa- both will be recovered while i am off work- as both are in the worst shape......then if i still have strength and/or time i want to make window 'treatments' for above the mini-blinds in the back room- i just can't decide how to go about it as the french door to the deck opens up about 7 inches from the ceiling and snags anything that hangs down too far.....of course, if we are talking projects, i could organize the giant box of photos- about 3 years worth- and put them in albums...when i win the lottery, i will hire a personal assistent to do these things, of course.........

      ok, so the c-w's have done a very bad thing- they have opened grandma crown's  present dvd of white christmas and watched it...it wasn't on purpose- scw tuned in a louisville station playing it but it would only show in b&w- mean mamma not paying for cable- you understand..........so mean mamma does one better- she opens grandma crown's christmas dvd of white christmas and we watch it.........so technicolor, so harmonious...so rosemary clooney and bing crosbey and danny kaye........NPR did a story on 'present at the creation' recently.....about the creation of cultural icons....and white christmas was one of the first stories......irving berlin knew when he wrote it it would become a big hit...but the radio bigwigs didn;'t quite see it his way...until pearl harbor....and all those g-i's who really wanted to be home for christmas.....it was huge hit in 1945......this movie wasn't made til 1954, and the song was used in another movie first (holiday inn) but this movie is a marvelous piece of americana...i cried at the end.......but then mean people tend to cry at the end-.......we think that the woman who played the housekeeper went on to play the wicked witch of the west.........

      ok, so mean mamma has finally done the math on her trip- and she has just enough money-----just enough. clearly, mean mamma has spent most of her disposable income on presents for her darling children........ therefore mean mamma will not be buying any castinets or sombreros, or other outrageous souveniers. well, maybe a few small things.........

      ok, so the news from new york state is bad- very bad- ecw's oldest sister has either an ovarian tumor that has spread to her colon or a colon tumor that has spread to her ovary- either way things don't look good.  she has already survived breast cancer......this is not good news , with both his parents dying within the past 16 months and his oldest brother having an inoperable brain tumor........she is scheduled for surgury on 12/26/02-please keep her in your prayers......mean mamma did cave to curiosity, and called coach mac re: plan scores........of course she is not telling, but she is proud, so proud.......still on the barcelona countdown- my fellow traveler's and i will be on the lookout for the 'smuggler-type' profiled tonight on NPR- this guy was arrested at lax yesterday- with 4 birds of paradise in his suitcase- 52 plants, tubers abd seeds, and 2 mini-monkeys down his pants.  I am amazed that anyone could travel any distance with 2 mini-monkeys down his pants. Think about it- even drugged, they would take up room, and they would itch..........with all the security precautions these days- who would try to smuggle mini-monkeys in one's pants?

      ok, so i will be in spain 14 days from today. i can already envision our first lunch- in a little place near casa mila on our way to sagrida familia.  i am already thinking about buying a sandwich/salad at the cortes ingles department store (around the corner from the hotel) for supper so we can go to bed early and get over our jet lag- this business of the spaniards eating late is fine- but not on the first day when i will be so exhausted.  at least i will not be freezing cold- like brussels. i keep saying i, but i mean we- as 2 of my very favorite people will be accompanying me on this iberian adventure.......again, there are those in danville who think it strange that i would again take a trip without my spouse- like he is tied to me like a millstone and my direction must therefore be his......he has expressed interest in a trip to ireland (his mother's mother was irish)  and we would also like to go to new zealand on a trekking vacation to see the lotr scenery. however, he had no interest in going to spain. so he is not going to spain. he understands my determination to travel as widely as possible while i am still able to do so.  if i become prematurely senile- then i was justified in my yearly jaunts- if not, then my life was the richer for it.....i am trying to decide about the camera to take along- my dad's old minolta is bulky- but takes marvelous photographs. the smaller camera is marginal on quality......i would feel better with dad's camera-for obvious reasons- he was devoted to photography for as long as his senses allowed-  i have 'borrowed' his photographs of the opera house in sydney and ayres rock- they now hang in andrew's new room- they are perfect renditions- and make me remember my dad...i would love to take such brilliant photographs in this trip.....

      ok, so i enjoyed the time article about google.com- which asserted that people who use it suscessfully for searches tend to come back and search 1) for their own name 2) for the names of old flames.  i am guilty of both.  the c-w's take up 6 pages of references.  as for old flames, one is a president and ceo of a company in denver,one is a veternarian and teaches at msu,  one works for the faa in washington d.c and another may be getting out of prison in w.v. soon- well- i am not sure that he is the same one i went out with in college, but it wouldn't surprise me.......on one of our last dates he shoplifted a pair of sunglasses from k-mart- anybody who would shoplift sunglasses as dating entertainment could easily end up in prison on w.v. 25 years later.......

      ok, so i ventured out to do a little shopping today before i went to work-  in goodies, where i waited in line forever to buy a few pairs of socks and a turtleneck for cayle- i witnessed a completely insensitive salesperson berate an octogenarian........is this your current address on the check?....yes......is this your current telephone number?......yes.......what is your work number?...............I don't have a work number........I'll have to get a manager if you don't have a job.......... the lady was at least 80...she didn't have a job because she had probably been retired since before this chick salesgirl was born......what kind of idiot holds up a holiday checkout line over a work number for an 80 year old woman?

      ok, so it is 10:15 saturday morning, and i am not only in my robe, i have no plans to get dressed anytime soon.  this is the first saturday in forever that we didn't have 2 or more lunch time events. i don't have to go to work til at least 4:15 or so- to heat up supper for the 2 events tonight. thankfully, they both chose turkey and dressing, which i prepared yesterday and will heat up this afternoon. turkey is such a crap shoot when it comes to roasting time- i find it much easier to sweat the 'roasting til it gets to 180 degrees- the day before than right before an event.  plus, turkey is easier to carve when it is cold......  ok, so i bought scw spanish video tapes so i could watch them. iam getting so nervous about spanish- i have got the 'smile and be pleasant' part of dealing with hotel, restaurant and shop people, but i have no actual words to say to them yet........there are only a limited amountof of  instances when  ...una cervasa, por favor.....is appropriate....

      ok, so today at the restaurant i received a pointsettia (sp?) in a lovely plaid bit of sparkly paper- with a condolence card from 2 females who listed only their first names-  alas- i know 2 sets of women with those names- and i am at a loss to decide which set sent the flowers-  i am hoping that the truth will unfold at church- that the church set will ask me if i received them and i wil be able to send a thank you note..........i received a xmas letter from my grad school roommate- she is living in her 3rd house on the same street- her husband is a builder- she is a junior-league type- which i do not hold against her- i find it humourous to think that i lived with her for 2 years with no inkling that she had that in mind.......ah well....so many mysterious womenin my life........

      ok, so i have become so feeble at 46 going on 47 that i can no longer open  a twist-off bottle of beer without an opener.  My poor, arthritic hands cannot get a good enough grip to manage the job any longer.  This particular milestone is not listed on any stress-assessment questionnaire-but it should be.  when an otherwise healthy adult can no longer open her own beer without mechanical assitance- it is something like when i was first told i needed glasees- you ARE 40,and you should expect these things......glasses, maybe, grey hair, maybe, but the lack of twist-off capacity- now that is almost too frail for words.........maybe i will become like renoir- they will tape an opener in my hand- like he taped a brush in his arthritic hands.........as i blog- the simpsons are on- homer figured out long ago how to handle the twist-off thing- he only drinks draft beer at moes....homer is technically my age, by the way- he also graduated in 1974, though on one  episode he may not have actaully graduated but that is the story of homer's life......anyway- i have discovered that  i may not be able to serve draft beer in my own restaurant, even with a liquor license, until i find out if i will sell enough of any partiuclarkind to warrant buying a 1/2 keg that will stay fresh 35-45 days.....we  have no idea how many beers we will sell-  and i can't be drinking beer at work, or i will get no work done.  life is sometimes unkind.......

      ok, so this van gogh robbery thing has me puzzled........ the following is from msnbc......          Leighton said the missing paintings were painted early in van Gogh's career. They ''have no market value since they were not for sale, but comparable paintings sold for several million dollars,'' he said.         ''View of the Sea at Scheveningen,'' a small picture measuring about 13 inches high by about 20 inches wide, of a boat setting off into a stormy sea was painted in two days in 1882. The thickly applied paint contains grains of sand blown onto the canvas from the beach where van Gogh worked. It is one of his first major pieces.         ''Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen,'' painted in 1884-85, shows the village church where van Gogh's father served as pastor. That painting measures about 16 inches high by about 13 inches wide.   ok, so why would someone go to the trouble of stealing 2 paintings from this fine musuem- and take those two particular canvases?  why not one of the more famous sunflowers or irises?  we visited this museum nearly a year ago- i am trying to envision the location of these pictures- van gogh canvases are so distinctive, and news of the theft so universal, the buyer must be someone who has no need to display them to anybody but himself.....like thomas crown, of course.....

      ok, so my catering job gave me new perspective on just how tidywe keep our operation and just how disgusting other kitchens can get.  we did a xmas party- dinner for 120- at a 'golf resort' in a neighboring county. the kitchen was huge- but incredibly gross- there was a turkey breast- whole, wrapped in original wrap- just sitting on the counter- by the uncleaned slicer- leftoverfrom some lunch event- now this was 4:30 and the  prep for lunch would have been over by 12- you do the math- i put the turkey in the closest working fridge- and went on with unloading my van.  the stove, convectionoven, broiler, and line of 4 fryers did not look like they had been cleaned, emptied of sludge or otherwise serviced since installation.  the stench of grease was overwhelming-someone has attempted to skim some of the grease sludge off the top of one fryer, and the bucket of greasey slime mixed with french fry crumbs was still sitting on the floor- you get the picture........the party crowd was no better- they all seemed to be smokers- and the party hall had only a limited # of ashtrays- so this high-class group used their uneaten salads as ashtrays. this is the first time i have ever seen one of my salads come back with a cigarette out out in the little dressing cup...........the banquet hall was a smoky cave- with that clinging, nicotine yellow film that settles on everything and permeates the clothing and the hair...........it will take us all several days to get 'over' this event.......

      ok so i had this really weird dream- we were catering a democratic party fundraiser in someone's home- seemed to be cleveland, actually, with its million dollar houses.  anyway, the  wife had had built a special closet in her kitchen for her wedding dress- presumably so she could look at it when ever the fancy struck her. it was in a clear plastic display - must have been a designer number.....there were numerous magazine racks, with issues organized by the celebrity cover- all the j;lo covers were together, and so forth.........at one pointecw was there, and someone we know in danville who used to live in cleveland, sho is a republican and would never have attended this event- asked us if we had sent scw  to preschool with her son, and ecw said- no. in fact, the child inquestion attended montessori for one full day before his parents pulled him out, stating that the lack of structure would never work with their child.......the memorable part of  the event was that i lost my shoes, and spent most of the  time  looking for them.......gentle readers, recognize any freudian elements that i have missed? i have no idea what it all means...........

      ok, so i worked late last night- we hosted a discussion/study group- all men- who have existed as such since the 1850's.  the group, anaconda, is not as mysterious as a fraternity or lodge, but they appear to have quirks, nevertheless.  we knew that they would not cancel- despite the weather, as this group didn't cancel for the civil war.....the other group that didn't cancel was a carryout for 32- an office party AT the office in question- the food was to be there by 6 and by 7 they called and said that they were done- come get your stuff......some officeparty- 60 minutes of pure bliss.............they were surely worried about the weather. the 3rd group did cancel out- 48 driving from berea and parts beyond- i knew the moment the snow started falling that that party was off indefinitely. ah well.......5 more parties before i rest sleep all afternoon sunday...wait- the cross country banquet is sunday- no rest for the mean mamma.......

      ok, so I am going in late to work- or later than usual.  The snow is so beautiful- and my coffee with real half%half is so tasty, and everything right at this moment is idyllic, except for the fact that there is no newspaper- a newspaper would make everything perfect.  Somehow, the computer, and coffee, and an extra half hour or so isn't quite what curling up on the couch with the newspaper can provide in terms of snug coziness.......

      ok, so after supper, we all filed up the hill, in the dark and crunchy snow, to see scw's 'installation'- he created a space/sci-fi snow mountain lit up with numerous candles that glowed against the gray to black horizon.  ecw thinks he is touched, i think he is brilliant- only time will tell..............

      ok, so i am reminded of the midwinter trip that scw and i took to wisconsin and chicago a few yearsback to see frank lloyd wright sites- the weather was somewhat icy and a few things were not open, but i remember the trip fondly because scw is such a fabulous traveler.  he and i have also been on solo trips to denver and to san franscisco as well as the infamous trip to nyc.

      ok, so i love this weather so much i went out and walked a mile just to be out in it......snow reminds  me of my ohio roots.  not much in ohio is ever called off for weather- i don't believe that osu ever closed during my 4 years there, nor u.c. in grad school.  in my first job i commuted to lawrenceburg, indiana from cincy- through northern ky by the airport on 275-  there were times when i made it to work despite snow and people who lived locally didn't show up because of 'bad weather'.  in the morning i will still go to work even if danville has no school because we have a carryout lunch scheduled and 3 suppers (2 onsight and 1 carryout) i am curious if any or all will cancel- but we will still be open- unless the governor closes the roads or something of that magnitude........i AM dreaming of a white christmas......as well as a much warmer barcelona........muchas i like a bit of snow- last january's trip to northern europe was a bit on the nippy side,.......

      ok, so when i tried to blog this morning- publishing was inexplicably unavailable- luckily i discovered this before i wrote one single word......i am reading a wonderful book that i bought off a sales table last weekend. i bought it solely based on the name----hotel du lac-----and the cover art.  turns out that it won the booker prize in the early 80's so it has a pedigree of sorts.   i understand that picking books based on cover art and title is akin to picking race horse bets based on jockey and the color of the racing silks.....sometimes you get lucky.......this book is about a popular british novelist who has to 'rest on the continent' for awhile after her affair with a married man is discovered......though the checks in under her real name, rather than her pen name, people will certainly figure out who she is, even in this proper swiss hotel on the lake.  while my description is rather plain, her prose is compelling.  this has become a wonderful 'bathtub' book, and goes well with a glass of australian white..........

      ok, so the meanmamma has metsomeone truly mean.........today a woman about my age with her daughter(early 20's) and granddaughter (maybe 7-8 months) ate in the restaurant.  between the 3 of them they ate a sandwich plate, a cup of soup, and a serving of mashed potatoes. when they got ready to go, the baby was screaming  bloody murder, and the mother said...i think the baby is still hungry...the grandmother said....no. i think she is just tired.....the grandmother then started putting an empty spoon  in the child's mouth ....over and over,,,,, the baby kept smacking its lips, like....where is the food? ,,,but the spoon was empty every time...the baby started screaming again, so the grandmother put an empty sipper cup (with a nipple on it) in the baby's mouth...the baby kept sucking at that empty cup as they walked out.......now that is meanness or stupidity or both- we could hear that poor baby screaming as she was loaded into the car..............

      ok, so the mean mamma has asked her children to submit short lists of precious gift wishes, with no immediate response.  therefore, mean mamma may be forced to choose from her own list of holiday gift ideas.........cacti, capri pants, talking toilet paper (osu fight song), volleyball net, quart jar of capers, footed pajamas, free willy on video, the new crocodile hunter movie on dvd, a subscription to golf digest, knee socks, spiderman action figures, precious moment figurines, a goldfish bowl, you get the picture.......

      ok, so i catered a wedding in lexington tonight for 325- at christ the king cathedral. you may recognize the name from the controversy- this is the church that allowed the baptism of the gay couple's quadruplets.  i may have declined the fine offer to become a catholic when i married ecw- but i have to give kudos to a congregation this open-minded.  i also have to hand it to the catholics- they are not hypocrits when it comes to alcohol- the reception was in the fellowship hall- open bar and dancing and all- these people have no problem at all with how the bible stands on weddings- they are for a good time, just like the wedding at cana. i have to pray for forgiveness on my own part in this matter- i gave up on trying to recycle the wine bottles, and the cardboard boxes and the whole mass of waste matter- the custodian came by and asked if he could take this mound of stuff out of my way and i said yes.....it was after 11:00 pm and my brain must not be able to deal with ethical issues this late.  i recycle every bottle, can, box and #1 & 2 plastics that come our way at the restaurant- but i just knew that we wouldn't have room to schlep it all back to danville.  gentle readers, forgive this transgression........

      ok, so today is friday, which means i have to work late.....i do not do well on long days.....in fact, the last half of a long day seems to unfold like slow-mo, but my control over actions seems on a 5 second delay.......i do not know how nurses working 12 hour shifts can do anything right..as i cannot seem to cook well after the 8th hour.......now that we have hired a real chef to work the new nightly hours, i am prepared to be humbled by my cooking...i have always had more guts than talent, and this will certainly shine when a trained and talented individual joins me in the kitchen on a regular basis.....i do not even use pro knives...just ones with big black built up handles designed for the elderly (elderly meaning at least 30 years older than me....) with arthrtis.......of course, these knives help my hands and wrists tremendously........i do hope to be the old dog that learns new tricks during the next few months.......

      ok, so mean mamma has just found out that she has a court date in the morning...it appears that i am the executrix of my father's estate only after the probate judge deems me so, and that i must sign any checks written on my father's account until the will is settled, even though the account is a joint one with my mother, and that she cannot collect his life insurance until the probate process is settled......and she will have to pay me a stipend for doing this......even though everything in question is already hers, with her name on it all .......i won't question tge stipend, however...maybe it will be enough for a ticket to florence......

      ok, so i watched the school/business closings this morning,....and scw commented ..what are you waiting for ? kcw 1 hour delay? ......well, yea.......i don't want to go to work any more than you want to go to school...i would love to hunker down on this really cold day with a cup of coffee....maybe even go back to bed for awhile.........

      ok, so scw and i set out to see adaptation, but by the time we reached burgin the snow was coming down to the point that we slowed down to 35 mph, and we ended up missing the 3:30 start time.......man-of-war alone seemed to take an hour, and semed to have 18 traffic lights, all red.......we ended up seeing about schmidt, which had characters and props/locations/vehicles/situations eerily similar to  my family experiences.........the r.v., the hummels, the tacky wedding soloists, the tourist attractions....it is still not clear to us whether this film was comedy or tragedy or drama...because there were elements of all three........and having seen kathy bates naked getting into her hot tub i will just have to kick start my walking program........

      ok, so mean mamma is thinking about going to a movie this afternoon...in lex...maybe adaptations...there are so many movies i would like to see now....the hours, the rabbit proof fence, chicago,  and so many more that i could see on video if i would only drive out to the video place........i guess it is not the drive out there, it is the drive back out there the next day....or eventually if i rent for more than one day.....  speaking of driving, mm drove over to lawrenceburg yesterday to purchase a few of the prospective 'beverages' for our wine and beer list.....some sugestions that were made by a potential distributor regarding beer- ky ale and siera nevada ale are not memorable...quite a bite......i do like the australian white suggested....by austin vale and another by mcpherson.....someone else will have to pick the reds, because i do not care for reds.......while drinking our biting ber, ecw and i watched our video a room with a view.....this is an oldie but goodie...and we had forgotten how much we like it...of course the discussion went to 'why have you been to france 11 times but never to italy?'  well, i do not know...maybe i could be forced to go to florence.......as long as my room has a view.........

      ok, so mean mamma had a brush with true meanness and walked away....well...not really walked away...as i am still sitting here, but resisted the temptation.....by mistake, when choosing a site, mm chose by mistake something that dealt with bin-login.cgi or something......and mm sat looking at a greymetter login page, with a really nice emily dickinson quote....not knowing......i open every door.......isn't aging horrible...can't remember 10 words for 10 minutes...but anyway....i resisted the temptatrion to sign on as scw......not really a temptation, as no one would have believed it for a moment.....

      ok, so the mean mamma is overjoyed......ecstatic.......over-the-top.......our whirpool bathtub, the one that wouldn't drain for the past 24 hours because the drain pipe goes through an un-insulated section of our ancient home.....AND WAS FROZEN....has now decided to thaw enough in this marvelously sunny afternoon to let all of the water out.....life is good when the pipes all drain.......life is also good because i have returned something that i had forgotten that i had.....last year, in strasbourg, when the weather was so bitterly cold, helen willis lent me a fur-lined lumberjack hat....i found it in my suitcase when i packed for the spain trip......now a year as passed by, so what does one do when one discovers such a breach in memory? one takes the hat back along with a sutiable peace offering...........we had a nice visit, especially the part when the precious willis cat was sitting on my car roof........  i drove over to the rasmussen/willis home in ecw's new mid-life crisis car- a vw cabrio (used, of course) black with tan leather interior and a convertable top.....it is much too nice for me to drive.....of course, now that i am again used to a  5 speed.....this is a piece of cake.....

      ok. so i am up much earlier than i would like, as we have a brunch thismorning...some sort of shower.....the timing is laughable, as if it is a baby shower, the poor mamma would rather be in the bed til the sun is way up and if she is getting married, well,  let's not go there.......we had reservations for about 30 last night, and ended up feeding 60...we ran out of almost everything...the last customers got the last 6 stalks of asparagus......in the lex herald leader, in the saturday section on gardeing/decorating/ etc there is an article featuring a mother and daughter in their new sunny laundry room,,,which appears to be bigger than my family room, along with cathedral ceiling and cabinets nicer than i have in my kitchen........now that i am starting on kitchens.....let me just say that in my 2.5 years of catering i find that the people who have the kitchens hire caterers for parties and eat out.....which means they spent a lot of cash on the grand spaces with high-tech counters, equipment, cabinets, etc...and use them basically on thanksgiving and christmas.....on the other hand the people who actually cook in their kitchens tend to make do with minimalist space and equipment......where is this rant going?  gentle reader, please do not presume than the mean mamma is bitter that she does not have a grand kitchen....if i had the cash to buy a better kitchen, i would spend it on plane tickets, hotels, and rental cars in far away places...........and still make do with the kitchen i have.....i am thinking about investing in a new pasta pot, however............

      ok, so when my husband cleaned out the crawl-space in the eaves beside our bedroom, he came up with some unexpected things.....among them a portfolio of art pieces i did in a class at osu...my one and only art class which explains why i majored in a science.....there is a self-portrait, a collage, a textural piece, a van gogh wannabe, the requisite charcoal drawing of a cylinder, block, etc,........i will store these along with the 'portrait' done of me by my boyfriend freshman year...which portrays me as a clown....he must have thought he was being clever....crown/clown..... get it?   he found many of his college belongings...among them reel-to-reel tapes and a tape player......lots of jazz, blues, etc.....one doesn't see reel-to-reel anymore.....  somewhere i might be able to lay my hands on poetry i wrote in college and graduate school......certainly not too involved nor rhythymicbut mine......i also have some pen and ink drawings that i have framed and on display that i did in graduate school as a form of procrastination.....again, not particularly good, but matted and framed and placed with framed photographs they are almost pleasing.....  tonight david anderson and a group of centre people ate at trc as part of an interview process......i always greet d.a. with condolences that the nobel committee excuded him yet another year......i generally joke and say that david is my only shot at actually knowing a nobel winner.....he always laughs, but he really believes down deep that he will win one day.........anyway, this time i had to stop and think, because there are so many talented people in the current sophomore class.....i may actually know a future nobel poet/literature laureate......of course, she keeps changing her web page, just when i was really liking the blinking, sultry eyes......

      ok, so for what it is worth, mean mamma thinks that danville should have called off school today....it is just too cold for kids who walk to school, and that is the point of a city school system.....most kids walk.....and some of them have no gloves or hats to wear.....well, the c-w children have rallied and located at least 1 matching pair of gloves apiece.....as a mother, i am so proud.....

      ok, so there is this paramedic in england who stitched up prince william's head in 1991, and recieved a thank you note from prince charles and princess diana......and now he is to auction it off next week, with a minimum bid of $2400.........i am aghast at this notion of auctioning off thank you notes.....especially ones from charles and di...if i had one i would have it framed and in a place of honor.....but i wouldn't sell it......given that sentiment, i should theoretically save every thank you note i have ever received in case the sender becomes famous..........of course i expect that some of my favorite bloggers will become famous, but that is another story entirely.....i have few actual live encounters with the famous....last year i was within smacking distance of mitch mcconnel, but smacking him would have been bad for business so i demurred.....i also saw the guy who plays niles crane on frasier in the louvre....and i have the autograph of don ameche (an oldies but goodies actor) that i got in the waiting area of charles degaulle years ago....it pains me that charles degaulle loks mispelled and i cannot think how it shoud be......for that matter mispelled looks mispelled........ah well.....

      ok, so i enjoyed the piece in the new yorker about demetri martin, who writes palindromes, and poetry, and palindromes that are poetry,.......he wrote this funny little piece called 'All The Words Written on a Bottle of Rolling Rock in A Different Order'...  in part....  Women, your ability to operate extra tender springs from birth.  Good machinery comes as your contents cause enjyment.  Cash, beer, a car: rock and rolling.  During 'it' the general warning: 'We may risk pregnancy acording to old problems'  it has occured to me that the talk of the town section fo the new yorker is nothing but longish blogs......  on other subjects....roe vs wade has been on my mind.....30 years of reproductive rights that the religious minority may be able to pry from the grasp of american women....i heard a piece on npr this afternoon about how the bush administration has had government web sites pull any reference to contraception, as bush is pro-abstinence and contraception information could push young girls and boys into premarital sex......frankly, i don't see bush as 'virgin at time of marriage' material, so lightening will strike him eventually for his hypocracy........speaking of lightening strikes...his stance on michigan's affirmative action policy is laughable, in that the only way that bush got into yale was because his family connections was like catching the golden snitch- an automatic 150 points.....not just a measly 20 out of 150 points given to students of color at u of m.....

      ok, so mean mamma has a soft spot in her heart for award shows.......not all award shows, but i will confess to watching the entire golden globes last night...i was pleased to see meryl streep win for adaptations (supporting actress) and nicole kidman will for playing virginia wolfe in the hours...i read that book several years ago, and wish to see it on the screen....kidman plays along with juliane moore and meryl streep...not alongside, as that is not how the storyline goes.....it is a complicated story line, but it works.....virginia wolfe is one of my favorite authors.....nicole kidman managed to capture her essense in the clips i have seen.....i do like to watch these shows to see what is being worn..some wear just stunning dresses, while some look merely foolish.....last night renee zellweger was perfect in a black off the sholder in a swirled satin, while sharon stone was frightful in a modified flapper get-up......she was so 'up'  dancing about and jumping to her feet at every award as to be chemically altered....poor thing..what was she thinking......one more award, tony sheloub won for monk......he is so perfect as that character....my kind of humor....

      ok, so the 'splendid table' interviewed moby this morning on npr about his new restaurant on the lower east side of nyc- called 'teany' because it IS teeny and because they serve tea in ny...get it? tea ny?  it is a vegetarian cafe/tearoom with 97 kinds of tea available so far...the locaation was chosen because it was within walking distance of both moby's place and the apartment of his ex-girlfirend who runs the place.....he can therefore walk to get a good meal whenever he is in town...he said that the only rule that he has imposed as owner is the one where no moby music will be played..at any time.....he didn't say anything about a ban on eminem music....but i am certain that the ban on that artist is also implied........moby declined to classify his place as a celebrity hangout.....in that it is so small....not a place to see and be seen.......

      ok, so my family acuses me of being sadistic, but not for the usual reasons......i like to watch figure skating..the us nationals were on tv last night, so i was watching.......one after another of the pairs competing did 'throw jumps' and the female partner would miss the jump and skid off into the rink wall.......now, gentle readers, i do not like to watch skaters slide into rink walls......these accidents are incidental to watching ice skating...people do fall down from time to time...my liking to watch skating does not revolve around the possibility that a skater will fall.........i watch in hopes that they will skate perfectly and elegantly without making gasping errors.......nevertheless, those i love made quite big deal over a presumed connection between falls and my preference for watching skating......i plan to watch australian open tennis later today........i will not be watching in hopes that the ball is missed.......just for the record.....

      ok, so i was at cnn.com just moments ago when a  black stain appeared on screen...it spread until a figure appeared and said' do you like to watch?' which then bled into fear.com......a popup ad...i am personally offended by popup ads......like the one that keeps coming up asking me if i am a smoker over 21..or the one that tells me that my netscape version is too old/slow/indifferent........at the time i was reading about the antiwar protests in d.c. and s.f.....listening to 'ohio' by csn&y, by the way.......there is a major generational gap that still exists when the word protest is brought up...my mother and brother see protests as bad/disloyal/just short of evil and i see them as a 1st amendment right/obligation.....the only demonstration i have personally attended had to do with legalization issues........anyway..... i am not in favor of burning down buildings...like the people at kent state at the time of the massacre remembered in ohio.......npr had a marvelous commentary this week about the draft...the speaker contended that the draft should be limited to children of families that make over $150,000 a year.......which will soon result in the banning of war altogether when that demographic has to sacrifice children......

      ok, so our keyboard at home has ceased to work on a reliable basis, which explains the numerous run-on words that pop up from time to time in this blog......i found myself last night pounding the space bar to get it to 'space'...quite frustrating when one must wait at least 1 second between words to get an the requisite distance between words to make them suitably readable......  book club was last night...a record crowd......to discuss lewis and clark book undaunted courage.....lots of pontificating about bravery, vision, selflessness....while all that may be so, i found some statements made by my friends to be somewhat disturbing....for example, the statement was made that the indian lifestyle was idyllic until l&c brought siphyllis (sp), whiskey, guns, measles, etc. the reality was that indians were tribal, and frequently fought each other long before l&c showed up....to become a man an indian adolescent must prove himself in battle as well as on the hunt....certain indian tribes already had crazy mixed up morality standards when it came to sex with non-spousals..... (see blogs before trip to spain).  the notion that indians were nice people messed up by the white man is quite naive.....anyway,  we had good banter helped along by wine, and then coffee to wash down apple pie.....next month the book club meets at my house to discuss my book pick, j. austin's persuasion.....a timely piece about courtship, marriage, and love.....i have been thinking about these issues ever since hearing about the divorce of a centre couple that we have known (distantly) for years and years.....what keeps a couple together and what drives them apart?  the couples present last night have been together 20+ years, with only 1 exception......i have known them, for the most part, during the entire 20+ years.....i would be devastated if any of them decided to break up and the wife move to philedelphia......

      ok, so we were visited by the 'best of the bunch' wine distrubutor today....a family owned business out of lexington into its fourth generation...the current general manager came himself...the business came through his mother's people..he appears quite savvy about wine and beer.....we may choose glen ellen as our house white,which i coincidentally have in my fridge as we  speak....we will be able to sell wine by the bottle,as well as by the glass,but the partially emptybottle can not be removed from the premises.......and we cannot sell unopened wine at all.....on the other hand...we can sell an unopened bottle of beer along with a carryout order.....go figure.....we will offer at least 2  other kinds of chardonnay by the bottle, along with sauvignon blanc, reisling, white zin,and both cabernet and merlot....maybe a pinot noir...with beer we will avoid bud and miller and coors in favor of something like ky ale,kronensburg (sp) etc.  none of this can happen until we get our l.l. the  distributor cannot legally taste wines with us until we are 'legal'.........

      ok, so a few days back home has given me a better perspective on this latest european adventure, and i am ready to identify the top 5 favorite and worst parts of the trip......yeh,yeh,eh, its not friday, but mean mamma is in the mood to summarize today......  The top 5- 1. the jealosies in palaeu guell 2. the hat 3. the staircase at casa batllo/the bench at parc guell 4. the meal at la gramola in barcelona 5. the goya painting of the fighting cats in the Prado  The worst 5- 1. the wine at the Prado cafeteria 2. scraping the rental car trying to park in bilbao/getting stuck at exit of st. sebastian parking garage 3. not being able to 'correctly' say 'la quenta, por favor' at any time or any place in 10 days 4. driving through blinding snow in 3rd gear on the way to madrid 5. panic at top of sagrada familia tower and climb down stairs

      ok, so i am listening to meanmamma mix, my xmas gift from acw.....neil young harvest moon......and thinking about book club..wednesday night.....about the lewis and clark expedition...and thinking about the language barrier.....so many different indian dialects.....so few interpretors for the size of the group.....so many times that the whole thing could have falllen apart over misunderstandings....of course, l&c lacked a linguistic backseat driver who corrected their every attempt to speak the language......

      ok, so back to the real world......i have printed off my eku class list.....40 students, which is the max i have been told.....oh my......i also spent the day painting cabinets and shelves at the restaurant....so much to do before we reopen next monday....the newly painted walls, upolstered banquettes, and new carpeting make a striking difference....certainly an upgrade in terms of image.....we are in a quandry (sp?) regarding when to open up for additional evenings...we had thought about valentines day, but we will not have our liquour lis. by then.....so frustrating.....

      ok, so i am so glad to be back in a smoke-free environment....i plan to wash all of my clothing first thing,,just to get the smell out...i wonder if suitcases can be drycleaned....cigarettes are pervasive in spain, even in stores....the museums ban them,but the museum cafes and bathrooms then smell all the more smokey because the nicotine addicts must feel compelled to smoke extras to prepare for the return to the smokefree galleries.....i found wafting cigarette smoke quite disturbing in restaurants......which do not understand the concept of smoke-free sections.....so glad to be home....

      ok, so mean mamma is home again....so home that her family patiently waited for her to cook supper,as if they hadn't really eaten since she left  home....having seen spain, i cannot really say that i want to go back.....not like france...i  would leave at this very minute to go to paris. barcelona is byfar myfavorite place to bein spain...iwill go back to see the finished sagrida familia...whenever that may be..in 2012 or 2024 or so......that will be worth the wait..but the rest of spain is not on my list of places to visit again.....maybe because of the language gap....or  maybe because i felt so very tired to be there.....gaudi was certainly the draw int he end...notthe bilbao guggenheim that spawned the trip in the first place......gaudi,it seems is every bit the genious that flwright was in america when it came to innovation in design...of course, i will miss the l.o.-who is a fine fellow female traveler........thanks for the jealosies........

      ok, so i am not done blogging, but i wanted to save before my internet cafe time card ran out........we are so spoiled at home to be able to use the net in an open-ended manner.....this buying of pay-as-you-go time is frustrating.....we are quite ready to go home.......we have each packed..and though we do not relish the thought of a 9 hour plane flight we are anxious to get on with the non-spain portion of our lives........we have enjoyed spain, but there is no place like home.......i am anxious to work on recovering the chair in the front room, repapering the upstairs bath...and maybe work on some window treatments......i am not anxious to get back to work...but who is after a long trip.....?  i am sad that i will only get to see acw for a few hours on sat night/sun morning before he goes back to school.....i really wish he had gone on this trip.....i have seen quite a few backpackers, and i envision acw on a similar trip at some point...as for the rest of my traveling crew, i can see each making many more trips, both short and extended, to the continent......i am certain that i, too, will return......maybe with the rest of the c-w's on a family trip to ireland......  thats it for spain....adios......looking foward to my family picking us up at the airport on saturday.......

      ok. so we are fast running out of time in madrid, so shopping took over when places of interest ran out......we went to plaza mayor after breakfast, location of many infamous inquisition trials......then on to royal palace. rebuilt by phillipe v, who happened to be grandson of louis xiv..it is somewhat similar to versailles.....many grandrooms....of interest was the stradivarius suite of 4 instruments built to be played together.......the ceilings were also very nice..not too overdone.....lunch in the palace lunchroom rachel bought what she thought was a vegetable sandwich, which turned out to be potato & pea salad sandwich with tunafish or fake crab added to it......who can tell these things at first glance.....we played the friday 5 game.......name your five most favorite foods.....mine are shrimp, red raspberries, smoked salmon, tangerines, and french fries.....not necessarily in that order....if i could go for 10 i would add olives, goat cheese, little kings beer, taboulleh,  and marinated artichoke hearts.......there may be more, but they do not come to mind right now......  i have also come to some conclusions about what i do not like.....i really do not like red wine.....i poured the rest of a bottle down the drain tonight because it was just so dry to the point of dehydration.......i did go the grocery in the basement of el cortes ingles in search of the wine we had last night....dona beatriz, a wonderful white..of course, i could only find something from the region, not from the exact vintnor...i also bought a bottle of randon red from riajho (sp?) and several cans of olives...i really love pickled things and these jars have both green and black olives, onions, and capers......wonderful........

      ok. so the blog that i just blogged int his internet cafe disappeared because i ran out of time.....i have now purchased for myself solo time, and mean mamma aint sharing this time.........we all have collective art overload, from seeing too many works of art in too short of time.....we actually walked past whole rooms of icons in the thyssen and said....seen it all...now move on.........3 major museums in less than 24 hours may be too much to ask of the mind......last night we saw the reine sofia..with guernika as well as many other picassos, gris, and dali......we were tired after being there for 2 hours (it was open til 9) so we took a taxi back to hotel (5 euros is a bargain when it is dark, raining...) supper at hotel was strange......scw had a fried meat plate of some sort, and a racion of calamari...i ordered a plate of marinated asparagus as a first course, but the waiter thought that it was all i wanted so he left....i ended up eating most of the calamari myself.....this morning we ate in the same place..scw and rts tried churros...i had a potato omelet.....we all enjoyed thoroughly the fresh squeezed juice...from a really cool machine that drops the oranges down into the squeezer while you watch.......on to the prado...where we were tickled to rediscover ppbj (poorly painted baby jesuss)  so many had tiny heads and scrawny bodies, with odddly placed features, and sickly coloring...and the madonnas often were portrayed with impossibly placed breasts...kind of like nursing goiters........i especially enjoyed the madonna who was able to squirt milk across a room into the mouth of one of the saints....now that is a feat worth remembering in oil........we saw many self-portraits...durer..goya...rembrandt....we wonder when sheldon tapley will paint the definitive self-portrait..........lunch at prado was good....a seafood salad..along with probably the worst white wine ever labeled as table wine......it was the color of urine and wasnt evern good enough to mistakenly labled sherry...i had a beer instead (.85 euros..) i have been disappointed with 3 out of 4 glasses of white wine i have had on this trip and 1 out of 1 glasses of red....the beer is the best bet for this country...in my humble opinion........the last museum was the thyssen...a private collection donated to spain by a rich family with a huge art collection.....many pieces we have seen similar elsewhere......we toured so quickly...at one point we kind of waved a hand over entire rooms of madonnas and deemed then ..seen.......so tired.......

      ok. so mean mamma has now been lost in.......france, hondarribia, st. sebastian, and bilbao, all in the same day.......the parador was up inside a walled area of hondaribbia....up cobbled narrow one-way street....which we inched up in the pouring rain.....parador was lovely..we were so tired that rachel fell asleep, and we basically chilled out after eating our stash of cheese, bread, tinned sardines and chocolate...as well as minibar nuts, olives, and assorted beverages.....the walls of our room were 5 feet thick, as it was a fortress..we have a window overlooking bay of biscay....nice sleep to wake up to a fabulous breakfast buffet with spanish potato omelets, 2 kinds of sausages, pastires, fruits, etc. in a lovely breakfast room.....drove to st. sebastian to see opera house (kursaal) where a marathon of sorts was taking place in driving rainstorm....the kenyans were winning....rachel forgot her coat at hotel so we drove back for it...scw asked at desk for her coat in perfect spanish, after looking up his verb in 301 spanish verbs......then on to guernika-lumo to see ancient basque oak tree...then to bilbao.  we saw signs for hotel, then drove and then walked forever trying to find it....one-way streets are a maze........this morning (7th?) we went to guggenheim by street car and then by metro. it is impressive, made of marble and titanium....the traveling exhibits featured rubens and kandinsky....lovely lunch in restaurant...sweet red pepper soup with prawns then salmon then chocolate mousse........with a nice white wine from la mancha.....had to move car from underground lot to the one at hotel...kind if scratched up side bumper trying to park in narrow side street.....oh my.......we are hoping tommorrow at madrid airport it is dark and they wont notice.......

      ok. so we got up 3 hours earlier than yesterday, and actually had a morning, a lunch, and an afternoon to spend in our last day in barcelona.  we toured the palau guell, one of gaudis first projects. it has many medieval charms, as it was built as a sons home next to papa- who was a count and quite wealthy and living in the historic barri gotic area of the city.....it could easily have been 500 years old by way of vaulting, pillars, ceiling decor, etc, but gaudi did a marvelous roof garden of pillars that make it look like a futristic forest.  we went to the grocery in the basement of cortes ingles department store, and bought both chocolates for gifts as well as provisions for our driving trip tomorrow. then we had a cafeteria lunch in the store penthousealong with every other family with screaming babies in town......i had a galician fish and vegetable platter-the fish was grilled and the vegetables were overdone, but it was good....and cost almost as much as our bill last night for so much less.......afterwards, we took the metro to parc guell, north of the city that overlooks everything down to the sea.....gaudi and the guells envisioned it as a gated community, with the guell place being the first one built,,,but the civil war and gaudis death kind of got in the way.....it was magnificent in terms of fantastic vistas, built-in curiosities like the worlds largest park bench, and all sorts of fun places to walk- inside a terrace of stone trees` , lots of succulent plantings, fungal forms like mushroomlike towers covered with ceramic tiles....too hard to describe....the fountain entrance has a ceramic-tiled lizard with water coming out of its mouth.....so much gaudi to see, so little time....i did put money in the dish of a man playing flute in an underground pillered room with wonderful acoustics....it was magical.......

      ok, so i had a near panic attack at the top of a tower at sagradia familia, and wisely took the stairs back down pronto.....i was halfway down when i came across an itlaina family, whose daughter cayles age was also in the midst of a panic episode...she was even too frightened to go down the stairs...and the father started shouting at her italian........i almost started crying..like he was shouting at me too...these stairs were both narrow, spiraling and steep, and it was dim enough at that hour that i couldnt really see down to tell where the next step was......that is it for mean mamma and towers...we will go back tomorrow to take an english tour..there was too much to see today before it closed........now to supper..we are starved.....

      ok, so the mean mamma is in spain, rested after a 3 hour nap ready to find a nice place to eatsupper. we arrived at the hotel at 10 to find, of course, that wew were too early to check in..so we dragged our poor tired bodies to 2 gaudi sights- casa batllo and casa milla, both within 6 or so blocks of hotel.  both extraordinary places in terms of design very over the top. i liked the rook sculpture garden at casa milla, all curious shapes covered with broken glass, or ceramic tiles, or just adobe.....quite beutiful and unexpected.  i will sign off, as we are in cybermundo, and 3 are sharing internet time.......

      ok, so today i got my hair cut.......it was time...one of those days when you couldn't stand to go another hour with the stringy, hanging hair in the way.....the hair artist, or whatever they call themselves now, felt compelled to discuss my lack of grey hair and the thickness of my hair, and the mistake the last hair artist made in trying to put layers in my hair........same salon, different artist.......i am always at a loss with what to say to these people, who feel a need to chat at a time when all i want to do is close my eyes and get it over with.........i am not a salon/spa kind of person......the experience is wasted on me......at this very moment my hair is nearly layer free.....blunt cut at chin length......i think i had this same cut briefly in grad school......some days i wish i was 22 again......but today is not one of them.......

      ok, so listening to simon and garfunkel singing together again has put them and their music back into my mind.....and great song's like kathy's song are now playing like a soundtrack in my brain........the lyrics are as follows:  kathy's song.....simon and garfunkel   I hear the drizzle on the way Like a memory it falls Soft and warm continuing Tapping on my roof and walls  And from the shelter of my mind Through the window of my eyes I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets To England where my heart lies  My mind's distracted and confused My thoughts are many miles away They lie with you in your sleep And kiss you when you start your day  And this song I was writing is left undone I don't know why I spend my time Writing songs I can't believe With words that tear and strain to rhyme  And so you see I have come to doubt All that I once held as true I stand alone without beliefs The only truth I know is you  And as I watch the drops of rain Weave their weary paths and die I know that I am like the rain There but for the grace of you go I   not many people have written song's to anybody named kathy.........

      ok, so tomorrow (2/25) is mm's birthday....so let me read my horoscope as predicted by king features.........Pisces..........authority figures, bosses, or parents might be overbearing today. smeone could make a naked power play. you don't have to follow thi sperson if you don't want to.....  You are Born today........you are a strong individual. You say what you mean and mean what you say. But you are also devoted, generous, and loyal. You will give your all for a cause that is near to your heart. This year, enormous changes can take place, perhaps as important as changes that took place in 1994.........Birthdate of  :scott (carrot top) thompson, tea leoni, and sally jesse raphael.......oh my,,,,carrot top is a new one....and this list left off george harrison and sean astin.........carrot top......this is too much information.........and for the record, 1994 does not ring a bell for big years of change for mm..................1984...when acw was born....yes.....1994.....no.........

      ok, so the mm has had yet another nightmare-ish day.........when lunch slowed down, i reached for my purse, in the spot where i always put it.......to start putting together a bank deposit.....not there.....i went out to my car, thinking i may have left it behind the seat ......not there.....had i locked my car? the cellphpne and the laptop were still there...didn't seem like anyone would have taken the purse but left the laptop/cell phone.....and i always check the door to make sure it is locked.......called my mom to walk down to the house to see if it is still on the counter.......that is happened before.....not there.....i get in the car and drive home myself to look for the purse.....not to be found.......has someone taken it from the kitchen? there was no cash..........i gave the last of it to scw to take to regionals on saturday and had not yet made it to the money machine...... so i started the task of calling the bank to stop debit card/checks.......called to stop bellsouth calling card......called for replacement insurance card....filed police report.............and when i got home there was a message from ecw.......cayle had my purse when she walked in the door at the store from school......she had hooked both her backpack and my purse when she got out of the car this morning........and her teacher had dutifully 'put it up' until cayle came home from school......rather than call me and tell me she was 'putting it up'............at least i have the purse, and everything is inside, and i don't have to stop a new pack of checks......i guess, as recent 'horrific dreams' have shown us, this incdent pales in comparison to the things that can hapen in this world to us and to our children.......i consider myself, right at this moment...one of the luckiest people in the world.......

      ok, so mm was blown away by several musical guests at the grammy's.....starting with simon and garfunkel:   Simon and Garfunkel The Sounds of Silence   Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again, Because a vision softly creeping, Left its seeds while I was sleeping, And the vision that was planted in my brain,  Still remains, within the sound of silence.  In restless dreams I walked alone, Narrow streets of cobblestone, 'neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night, and touched the sound of silence.  And in the naked light I saw, Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking, People hearing without listening, People writing songs, that voices never share. And no one dared, Disturb the sound of silence.  "Fools" said I, "You do not know, Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you, Take my arms that I might reach you." But my words like silent raindrops fell, And echoed, In the wells of silence  And the people bowed and prayed, To the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning, In the words that it was forming. And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls." and whisper'd in the sounds of silence.  ecw and i just sat and sang along, like it was a favorite hymn.......i always think of this song in paris...because in paris the words of the prophets ARE written on the subway walls......i also enjoyed james taylor playing sweet baby james accompanied by yoyo ma on cello....so pure and lilting a meelody...finally i enjoyed norah jones; performance.......there is something to be said for singer/songwriter/musicians in this world where many have only the talent of jumping up and down...(yes, i saw avril..........)

      ok, so the smoked salmon did not sit too well last night, because i had the most horrific dream........i dreamed that central baptist er called us at 2:45 am to ask if we were, in fact, the parents of acw, who was currently unconcious, with a blood alcohol of .407, intubated because he could no longer breathe on his own.........brought in by his friends brian and jeremiah from a party in the neighborhood..........the nurse said......if this were my boy i would get in the car and come up here right away..........right............so in my dream our sweet baby boy is totally out, with tubes out of his nose, his arm and his private parts,,,,,,,the nurse informs us that if he had not gotten to the er he could have died, as he was retaining co2 because the alcohol had stunted his lung capacity drastically......thankfully he had no illicit narctoics in his blood stream, which would have complicated matters exponentially.........i dreamed that when he 'came to' he was belligerant to the nth power, swearing like an mtv awards presentor, and swore that he had not only not been drinking but that he had, in fact, gone to bed at 10:00, and that someone must have set him up, and that we, his parents, must be in on this travesty, and that this whole thing was our fault, surely............yeh, right.........the dream gets worse....when acw is actually released, he runs out of the er door toward uk.....in his father's shirt and no coat, as he has no idea where his clothing is.....and his father runs after him........in the dream, i try to follow in ecw's new car, but i cannot find reverse on the column, and fall into tears with the fear that i will be trapped in the parking garage of central baptist indefinitely because i cannot back out of my space.......i finally locate ecw, who has lost acw in a field......still with a blood alcohol of over .2...legally and essentially still drunk........and after a scuffle of some magnitude..........ecw flags down a policeman, who says that if he is caught legally drunk on campus he will be thrown out due to zero tlerance rule......we hope that he makes it to his dorm before he is seen running across campus at 7:30 am......we drive to his dorm....and find his footprints leading to the door.....even in dreams people who sell shoes can tell the difference between running shoe makers when it comes to prints........we call from the lobby....yes he is in his room, and when he tells us to fuck off......we go home..........because in dreams you just fade away...........fade to grey...fade to memory...and memory softens, even after a few hours....it must be why women cannot remember accurately about birthing pain just weeks after delivery........i delivered that child without anesthesia.....i appear to be making up for lost time now...........oh yeh....he cannot find his coat....i think that this his the 4th or 5th he has lost in his lifetime.....he will have to find the next coat on his own....the montessori rule of natural consequences alludes to such realities.........such a dream.........with dreams like this, who has need of reality?

      ok, so i have been in smoked salmon heaven this week...i was forced to buy smoked salmon to make mousse for a client, and there was so much left over that could not be left to go to waste.......i like smoked salmon alone, on bread with capers, with sour cream......i adore smoked salmon......alas, the mousse did not go over as well......much left over, and left at the client's house........catering parties is the hardest thing i do.....especialy when the party is hosted by friends..it is awkward presenting the bill, and awkward being both the caterer and an invited guest......ecw didn'd even attempt it......he stayed home tonight despite being invited as well....i was at this home from 5:30-11:30...in heels, no less.....but it did go well, and the food looked great...and that is all that matters....i did spend much fi the evening nervous because i did not hear from scw and the results from academic competition until 9:30 pm....he will be going to the state for the 5th year in a row in social studies, general knowledge and quick recall.......i am so proud, though he could not have gotten the talent from me.....back to thsi party....i spent some time talking to betsy wilt, who just returned from provence with a group of 8....only to have it snow in provence......the theme of the trip of antiques, but the markets closed due to the weather..and the euro was so much stronger than the dollar...she did not have a very good time.......and at this party every second person had a thing or two to say about my potential wine list....everybody has different tastes...... about beer, and about whiskey......and about wine......  so glad the l.o. is back.......the c-w's are donatng a book to the danville/boyle county public library in her name.....the library has no up-to-date book about barcelona........and dk/eyewitness has a specialized book coming out in march.......i know that sister sheila enjoyed barcelona.......i still have the email she transferred through your mom about what we should see there.....i wish i had known her.....mm has so few readers she must treasure each one.............

      ok, so in a fit of pre-birthday mania i bought myself a copy of the importance of being earnest, the play by oscar wilde......i saw this originally in college with a boy named maynard who told me that he could never be serious about me as long as i was so stuck on myself..........oh my, if he could but see the mm now.........anyway, i have spent the past 23 years with someone named ernst, who is often referred to as ernest...my own grandparents asked, at his meeting if he was not, in fact an ernest....a family name, as ernst is his family name, but a different family..the ernst's are from mainz, which i did not visiit due to the unfortunate business with the diesal fuel...........the movie with colin firth, judy dench, frances occonner, and reese witherspoon is delightful for anyone interested in such melodramas.......i will remember it for sheer entertainment....and for the tatoos...........

      ok, so i was saddened to hear of the club fire in rhode island, where pyrotechnics caused almost immediate combustion to insulation/sound enhancing material above the stage.......turns out the fireworks display needed clearance from the city fire marshall, but none was sought...also unclear whether the club manager knew that fireworks were in store for the older wooden structure......the group's guitarist is among the missing and presumed dead......i am not familiar with great white, the group, no group wants to be known for this......

      ok, so i had the opportunity to talk to ms.nancy alcock on the phone today...80+ year old nancy, who had the guts to go the laramie project yesterday, past the silly protestors, and to get up at the open mike portion and say her peace........scw wrote it all down for the rest of us to read......she certainly said it all when she says that god loves us all............i am embarassed that scw had to explain what the signs meant.....these were terms i had not heard......ironically, the sons and daughters of these protesters have as an equal chance of being gay when compared to nonprotesters.......they simply won't be understanding when their own day of reckoning comes......

      ok, so today my partner and i tasted wine and attempted to assemble our rough draft wine list.....some that were tasted were rejected...a chardonney by powers in washington state was much too flinty for my taste.....we enjoyed every bottle by coppolla's vineyard, and several from australia  so now we have to decide which we will offer by the glass and which by the bottle, and which will be offered by both ...glen ellen appears to be our house wine line......we have sent in our application for a liscense....so we are now in the waiting mode.....

      ok, so it is true....blogger's parent company pyra labs has been bought out by google.......don't know how this will affect my blog....stay tuned.....  my routine has been altered by the ice storm that hit lexington.....even though i don't live in lexington...i listen to wuky for 20 minutes before i get outof bed, and on my way to and from work in the car........wuky has been off the air since sunday morning....and i have been forced to tune in wwku in the car, and weku on my bedside radio...this morning the list of school closings was much different that i am used to, as richmond is further east and covers much of eastern ky.......the good news...both danville and boyle have school today....no word when wuky will get back on the air.....even though these are public radio stations, they each do things differently, have differetn voices than i am used to waking up to, and offer slightly different programming.....change is hard.....

      ok, so we are catching up on the aftermath of a parental visit....cayle's birth mother has bought all sorts of stuff, useful and craplike, which we must deal with...for starters are the treasures...rings and necklaces and the like that the birth mother beleives that cayle will treasure all of her days......cayle will lose these things within a week.......the smileyface ring, the amethyst ring.......all will be lost in a blur of confusion......and when the birth mother comes back next year, she will be hurt that cayle cannot recall any of the details of the last round of gifts.......all of this brings me to the issue of michael jackson ,and any other who has childrne not his biological own.......trying to keep children from their biological parents is foolishness...no matter what debbie rowe says on tape, she will welcome these children when they are 18 and can legally leave michael' s strange existance.......cayle will certainly head for florida when she turns 18,,,,,,and be disappointed that her birth mother is not prepared to deal with her...........

      ok, so i received an email today that a niece of ecw had a baby yesterday weighing over 10 pounds .......whup is the only response......we did not know they were expecting...despite multiple funerals last year when every one gathered and caught up on news........we are excited for any couple going for a third child...we think it is the child that will certanily drive you mad..the first is practice, the second is a piece of cake and the third is sheer craziness........the good news is that the baby was big, which means that she ate well......a business aquaintance recently divulged that he had had a vacectomy, at the age of 47+....he wanted praise, but i was aghast that he had waited all of this time.......his children are both over 17..for god's sakes.......what took him so long......my in-laws were catholic  and it was the potential for new babies that drove them to separate beds long before desire faded...i hope that my children are responsible with birth control, and do not rely on prayers to limit family size..........

      ok, so the mm will NOT, i repeat NOT be watching any more footage on michael jackson...further, i will no longer discuss him at work with my cohorts, nor utter his name in polite society...hence force he is persona non grata (i ask the latin scholars to check for spelling on this one....) the term michael jackson special is a contradiction in terms.....  so this morning i took a chance and drove my carfull of cardboard to the recycling place, only to find it open.......who knew.......i would have brought more from the garage if i had but known.....saving the world is really ruining the back end of my car......by the way.....but i do not lose sleep over this......exactly what was closed on this president's day?  my bank was open (national city) but i got no mail....or rather scw got no mail.....he is now getting stuff from mit, brown, duke, etc ands reads none of it.....i enjoyed the part in the simpsons last night (can't remember if 300 or 301) when lisa is offered a full ride to the seven sisters if she throws the spelling bee)   i know a few women who attended places like smith and bryn mayr.....both live alternative lifestyles........so i was amused to see the 7 sisters on mt olympus and how they were portrayed.....i really did enjoy watching the simpsons.......moreso now that my boys are beyond the age of bart simpson..(badboybart)...and moreso now that i am aging along with marge and homer......my life seems so serene to be exactly their age without their problems.......you do the math, marge is now 47 with a baby in diapers.......

      ok, so mm is in a recycling dilemna....my car is full of cardboard, my garage is full of cardboard so i cannot empty it from the car into the garage, and the recycling center is closed for president's day......i cannot leave it in the van, as we have 2 deliveries today. and if i leave it outside the recycling center, the cardboard will become soaking wet and useless to be recycled.......  acw called yesterday.....he doesn't call often or come home regularly this semester....things have settled in for him and he has figured out how to do his laundry int he dorm.....he doesn't have class today because of the ice storm...and he was surprised that the storm missed danville......we miss him very much.......he has confirmed that he is enamored, and hopes to bring the young lady to lunch at trc cafe one day soon......i cannot wait......  onto other news,  our youngest child somehow got herself into internet sites where she did not belong, and somehow got one naughty site set up as our home page........we were horrified..........she went from a google search from animals giving birth to sites that defy description.........oh my.......we had to discuss strict guidelines on what we expect in terms of internet viewing, as well as warn her that internet travel is not privtae and that we will find out about it, and if she were to go to these sites at school or the library she would permanantly lose her internet priviledges.....as it si, she is on her last chance with us regarding these sites......  i am so sorry to hear about sister sheila....i hope that she is resting comfortably and in no pain.......she is in my prayers......and the family who wait at her bedside remain in my thoughts.....

      ok, so i did stay up to watch beck on snl, and no he did not sing devil's haircut...he did sing a song that sounded very much like and old leo kotke piece, in a voice that sounded much like leo kotke.......my neighbors sophomore year were very into leo kotke, and though i did not hsell out the bucks to go see him in concert at the time. i do enjoy listening to his brand of acoustic guitar and gravelly lyric.......i also want to go on record as saying that i liked beck's pink and green striped shirt so much that i may look for them to give as gifts to my beck-fan sons....surely they would wear a shirt just like beck...........  i had a complete lapse of judgement this morning...i got up, got dressed, and drove to church, only to find that the parking lot was empty...it never occured to me that church would cancel due to the rain/ice storm........so i came right back home, changed out of my new outfit, and set up on the couch for a day of reading under an aphgan (sp?)  well, it is not really new..just new to me.......i wore one of the pairs of pants i bought for $2.50 at the goodwill on harrodsburg rd 2 weeks ago...they are from talbots...cream with black ticking...they fit very nicely and for $2.50 i am absolutely thrilled....at goodwill stores, they often take 'namebrand' items and mark the price up, and plce them on a separate rack called 'specials'...this rack always has stuff from the gap, tommy hilfiger, and kathy lee (whup)....but inevitably, brands that i like, from ann taylor or talbots are NOT on the specials rack despite the fact that the original price tag far exceeded that of the specials stuff....means that somebody has no clue as to actual value of the goods in question.......ah well.........

      ok, so beck is on snl tonight, along with jennifer garner from alias.....i would stay up to watch beck, but i am quite sure he will not play devil's haircut........my favorite driving in europe song..so i will just go to bed.......i have tomorrow off, as fate would have it........after church the birth mother goes home. and we will pick up the pieces that always follow a visit...and eventually things will become normal again...........my mother is buying a new computer....we are trying to steer her toward one with dvdrw/cdrw so that we can make the most use of it.....very selfish motives, but times is tough........she will send her 'old' computer down the street, and we can retire the one that cayle uses...after the domino swtiching of every other computer in this household (now numbering 4...if you count the laptop) of course, none of our computers is less than 3 years old....ancient by media standards........and none has any speed to speak of......2/4 can get an internet connection......speaking of internet.....i enjoyed lucas's site......quite profesional in it's design, crisp appeal.....readability...i liked his schedule in the corner.......i could publish my schedule, but it would say...monday work, tuesday work,,,,,,,etc........now that cayle's birthday is past, we are on track for my birthday, and the annual book club fete......  but this talk of war is getting in the way..........i was heartened to read of the 600+ antiwar protests that took place today.......npr broadcast sylvia porjoli from rome, who said that their were 2,000,000+ in the streets, both young and old, and decidedly not the red-flag waving crowd that usually comes to such gatherings......gwb may have bitten off more than we can chew with this fiasco.......

      ok, so my husband was asked by a centre professor, who was recently interviewed by psychology today and redbook regarding the economics of love about how his marriage has lasted so long.....he replied, that we have separate bank accounts, and we give each other plenty of space........we didn't make the redbook cut.....however, our friends who fight by the wife doing all the talking wihile the husband sits and says nothing made the redbook article.....ha.......ecw and i have nothing to say about fighting because we do not fight.....i cannot remember the last time he spoke to me in a raised tone......or i to him..........when we talked of this tonight...he laughed and said that rather than fight i simply ignore him until he gives up.........which seems right...as my parents never fought and i have few resources on which to draw...better to ignore the debate as whatever is the matter will keep til another day.......on the other hand, his parents fought frequently...one visit to danville they screamed to high heaven about whose fault it was that my father in law arrived with no underwear.......i was in shock...as my parents would havw just driven to walmart and bought underwear rather than fight about it. and they would never have let on that there was an underwear issue.......

      ok, so the mean mamma was drama mamma today when she started to prepare 80 pounds of chicken breasts for a big event saturday, only to find that she actually had 80 pounds of chicken wings......luckily the saleperson can deliver the correct poundage on saturday morning and all should be well.........  i didn't sleep well last night...i woke up around 3:00 am smelling smoke.........i looked allover the house for the course, then finally went outside, where the scent was more pungent......could not locate any burning buildings in my vicinity........as i plodded about in the dark in bare feet.......however..i kept thinking about the water heater and i was afraid to drop back off to sleep lest we all die because i was not vigilant enough...........i could still smell the burning when i went out for the newspaper at 6:50 am...i have no idea where the scent was coming from.....  friday night we have enough reservations we have now a second seating at 8:30, which means we will never go home before 11:00 pm unless we can convince these tables of lovebirds that they want to skip dessert and head on home......  i want to thank the l.o. for her advice on cayle's birthday gift way back in madird...the perfume with the necklace was a big hit......

      ok, so the mm finds all of this contraversy about the laramie project curious.......do those reverends really think that people decide to be gay based on plays that they have seen about people being brutally murdered? i did enjoy the one letter in the paper tonight from the woman who related the entire thing to the civil rights struggle....we all just want to be understood and accepted for what we are....in my case that is an aging, white, francophile, bibliophile, oenophile, democrat, free choice, liberal baptist, seamstress who cooks for a living.......whoooooooooo. that is not all but time is nigh for my third child's birth mother to appear........i do not think there is enough wine on hand for this occassion.......  but back to the laramie project. i have a new appreciation for the gay lifestyle, in my current partnership, and there is nothing easy about it......the reverends in questions would be shocked to learn of the extent of the gay community in danville....and none were swayed to the other side by the laramie project..............they all came to their own conclusions on their own......most have never told their mothers, but that is beside the point........how would i feel if one of my children told me.....i do not know.........i am still dealing with the wearing of undergarments. the getting of permits, and the completion of college courses........i will worry about that issue on another day.........like scarlett ohara,...............oscar, .best actress in a leading role., vivien leigh 1939..........

      ok, so we had another new person start work today, and expect 2-3 more to start tomorrow night.......change is tough, as the new chef's assistant (his wife....) was working in the kitchen today getting ready for the new dinner menu....and we had to juggle oven space, refrigerator space....counter space....the nice thing about having her there was the fact that a) she can both talk and hear b) she has interesting things to say....i have worked with a deaf assistant for so long that i almost forgot how pleasant a workday can be with someone to talk to....in the past, i could go all morning without speaking if the phone didn't ring......we start a new lunch menu tomorrow, with a few new items....like the availability of  shrimp or grilled salmon on a salad, and a seared salmon filet on focaccia bread....ah well, i work the next 17 days without a day off...pray for me.......  pray for all of us.....by the way....cayle has just gotten over the flu and scw is now stricken....when scw asks to be taken to the doctor, he is unwell.......i cannot afford to be sick.......

      ok, so i have been informed that my pick for book club in feb 2003 is not a popular one.......jane austen's persuasion......a social satire not a novel.......my last 3 picks have been equally as unpopular...colette's cherie..........virginia wolfe's to the light house......sue grafton's a is for alibii.........surely my taste in reading does not mesh with the danville running community......year after year.............of course i suffered through undaunted courage...but those who will not give jane a second thought are cowards at the very least..........jane austin is the most pure writer of prose to come along in 3 centuries let alone 2.........and i am not even a janite........

      ok, so the mean mamma is considering a change....from mean mamma to drama mamma..........to bahama mamma.......no, i do not have plans to go to the islands.........but i like the sound of it better than mean or drama......i sounds like someone who has a good time with great food and good beer......speaking of the islands, i have never been to an island paradise......which kind of sounds suspicious when said aloud....france 11 times, island paradise 0 times......i am either really crazy or somehow determined to spend my leisure time in places that tend to rainy, dreary, and cold/damp.   maybe i do not feel i deserve sunshine......i thought that this past trip to spain was a real positive step, and then i rained/snowed most of our trip.......so much for costa del sol.......  pray for the mean/drama/bahama mamma......her 3rd child's birth mother descends tomorrow...and all will be in upheaval until she is gone...........

      ok, so i have read every reporting today of the oscar nominations....and i am unashamed in my interest......i have watched every oscar presentation for as long as i can remember, and i find the genre of great cultural significance.........think about all  the films not nominated in any given year..they tend to be the most watched, biggest grossing films,,, the kind i don't even pay to see on video...at least with oscar nominations i am likely to rent the video at some point...maybe the same year of release.........of course, i take umbrage when my 'films' don't win...like lotr, which did not win best picture last year, and i am appalled when actors appear to win on the sympathy vote.....i do enjoy the fashion parade on the red carpet.....and the thank you speeches...if i won i would likewise thank everyone i knew.......ah well.......

      ok, so i received the following as an email from my only sibling:   U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, at the 11th hour, has altered his next presentation to Congress to try to satisfy the concerns of Congressional Democrats, as well as U.S. critics elsewhere in the world. Previously, Mr. Powell had planned to show images and documents demonstrating that the Iraqi government has weapons of mass destruction, and is deliberately deceiving U.N. inspectors. However, the White House has become convinced that even with such overwhelming evidence, the U.N. and Democrats in Congress will still oppose action to disarm Saddam Hussein. So, instead, Mr. Powell will present the following accusations against Iraq:  Saddam Hussein personally owns guns, and uses them.  Iraq produces oil, the combustion of which will doom the planet to a second ice age.  Saddam supports the death penalty and uses it.  Saddam supports the concept of "ZERO" separation of church and state.  Saddam supports prayer (5 times a day).  Most Iraqis, including all government officials, drive Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs).  Saddam's daily menu consists entirely of endangered species.  Saddam believes that Iraq is better than other countries.  Saddam is decisive, often seeing issues in black and white terms, rather than countless shades of gray.  Most Iraqis are meat eaters.  Many Iraqis are "Pro-life", opposing abortion.  Saddam supports school vouchers.  A few Senate Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Tom Daschle and Ted Kennedy, having previewed the script for the presentation expressed outrage at Iraq, and wondered why President Bush had not previously gone public with such "damning evidence."  "We are ready to authorize the immediate use of overwhelming force, " said one unnamed Senate Democrat. "This crazed dictator must be stopped before his ideas spread throughout the region."    The previous cut/paste has reaffirmed why i am not a republican, why i am not for the war, and why i am the black sheep of my republican family.......

      ok, so i watched what i thought was the last episode of joe millionaire......i had not watched any moment up to now, and i tuned into to see the chateau more than anything.......i fantisize about owning french property...not something quite that big......more like a cottage near the med and/or a paris apartment near the muette metro stop........the concept of dating someone in full public view is quite bizarre, and this guy is not someone i would drool over....he is more the big/dumb kind of guy rather than the well-read well-informed sensitive/intuitive kind of guy...of course, this whole hour was not the end..the only thing i really got out of it was a good long walk on the treadmill..........

      ok, so i just read a lengthy review/critique of mulhooland drive at salon.com.......which purports that diane had hitmen kill her lover camilla, and the movie is essentially her fantasy of how she wished things had turned out with her life and her relationship with camilla..........that she had come to hollywood and had an immediate audition and job offers and that camilla would have become not only in love with her but dependent on her and she kills herself out of guilt and dispair that she is just a waitress who came to town with big dreams that never came to fruition......and that other people get all the breaks......they did not know who the cowboy was supposed to be, or the meaning of the blue box.....just too weird....must get this movie out of my mind........

      ok, so the sun doesn't shine in boyle county, at least so far as the new liscense plates go......apparantly the sunshining bright against a rainbow sky hasn't sold well in b.c. since it came out,.....and sales of fundraiser plates is way up.........except with the gay community, who have rallied behind the rainbow-part of the plate, and think it great that the motto is right there in black and white....'we ARE that friendly'     what a hoot.......i am sure that the people who devised this plate never thought about the rainbow and its newfound symbolism....... ah well........  sc and i watched mulholland drive yesterday....we were unprepared for the scene between two women, but couldn't even comment on it because my mother was in the room reading the paper, just out of eyeshot......whup.....i am still trying to figure out what happened in that film......is the man in the cowboy hat playing god, and recasting his storyline with different people as the tape plays on?  the actors all changed who they were playing about 3/4 of the way through....it was quite bizarre, especially when the happy couple form the plane were turned into midgets and they came screaming into the room and betty turned diane can't take it and she kills herself.......too strange........speaking of the scene with the two women, the least they could have done was to find two actresses with believable breast...the dark haired woman has been enhanced, i suspect......she is quite overinflated and cannot now sleep on her belly.........  there is now a tv ad for breast enlargement, by some surgeon out of lex.....the woman in the ad works hard, so she deserves to have her breasts enlarges since this will make all of her hard work somehow worthwhile........oh please.......

      ok, so scw contends that mean mamma should be renamed as drama mamma for reasons i shall not devulge in this forum.........in return, drama mamma has discovered that althougth scw has never died in his black hat, he can be tickled while wearing the hat, but only for a fleeting moment when he realizes that he cannot tolerate tickling and he retaliates.........  drama mamma regrets that she is unable to attend the indigo girls concert tuesday at singletary center........there are few acts that i would like to see in person, and they are one of the select......their song 'closer to fine' has the sweetest harmony and the most poignant lyrics......amy and emily have been together as a recording act for 20 years, and 3 years as a duo prior....there is something to be said for longevity in a tenous business like the recording industry........in the herald leader article, emily spoke of a concert where upon amy lost her voice, and the audience simply sang her part to help emily out....i suppose i like their music because it is forceful without being angry.......alas, i teach on tuesdays and life gets in the way of good times..........

      ok, so today is sunday, my only day off this week, and i have to really start tidying up my house.....cayle's birthday is wednesday, and her birth mother will be here....i really aught to finish these window treatments for the back room and get them up...as the frames we took down from the cafe at the restaurant were cut down to fit my windows AND they are sitting around on the floor...in the way......my mother managed to break  her own sewing machine as well as mine while making the new drapes for the restaurant....the velvet valance really bogged up the works.....so that neither of us had a working machine to make my own 'awning-like' window treatments......they shouldn't take long...if i am lucky we will get it done this evening.......i read in yesterday's paper that sewing is seeing a comeback, which i find curious......i have sewn all of my remembered life........and i know that a successful project requires fabric (which i have in abundance), a machine (check), the right mood (oh my....) time (ditto) and the need to get the project done (there's the rub) these days i seem to lack mood, time and the pressing need to finish projects...so i have several projects sitting unfinished in my sewing cabinet......such as a quilt top that i started at least 7 years ago......it is several shades of blue....and i no longer have a blue-themed house.....so i kind of lost interest in it.....i thought about finishing it for acw as a graduation gift, but lacked the time and so it languishes unfinished on a shelf....maybe if i get it out and do a little everyday., i might finish before scw graduates.......the fabric thing is kind of funny.....i actually cleaned out my fabric closet not too long ago, and gave several garbage bags full to the goodwill.....and i still have too much.......pieces that i think maybe i could use to make something for cayle........if only i had the time or she had the need or i was in the mood.......

      ok, so i spent 4 hours this afternoon attending mandatory alcohol training...learning how alcohol affects people, and what servers do about it as well as the extent to which i am liable if someone drinks too much or drinks illegally.......initially we will card everyone who wants to drink, including little old ladies with canes.....until we get a feel for telling who is at an age to ask in the first place..and a feel for what fake id's look like...frankly, i would be flattered to be asked for my id......we also learned that we are liable for parents who allow their children to have their own glass of wine......your child may taste with your permission and at your discretion, but they absolutely must have no glass in front of them......so much for my entire trip to spain ......, where the waiters automatically poured scw and lo a small glass......essentially we had 4 hours of watching videos of people being rudely drunk, and the servers dealing with it...our liscense will be an adventure.....

      ok, so mm watched most of the rebroadcast michael jackson interview....what a sorry state of affairs.....mm doesn't know which issue to comment on first...the nose/facial surguries, the children sleeping with him, the veils on his children..........the statement that his ex-wife has no contact with her children because 'she can't handle it' what kind of father would want to raise his children to have no intimate relationship with their mother...certainly not one who wanted to raise healthy happy and well-adjusted children...to desire to be everything to one's children and to not share them is quite vain and egocentric......the veils also indicate that jacko feels a strange possessiveness with his children.....only his eyes may look upon them...they belong only to michael and he will not share with the rest of the world.....i will pray daily for those poor children.......that they not grow up to be just like daddy......the segment on 20/20 about jacko's many facial transformations was staggering....the screen 'morphed' his face from the original through each successive new 'look'.....at least 8 different nose/skin tone/check/chin variations...and then replayed jacko's insistence during the interview that he had only had 2 surguries on his nose 'that he could recall' and that those were to help him breathe so that he could hit high notes..........please, jacko, give us some credit.......the changes are as plain as the nose on your face.......and the present nose is quite scary....it is so thin and shortened....the plastic surgeon interviewed (not the one who did the deeds.....) said that michael has an end-stage nose.....nothing further can be done because their is no longer any original cartilage to work with.......he also contends that he has some rare disease that has caused his skin to bleach out.......yeah, right......  of course, not just the rich are into transformation......one of our best customers, who has not been in since before xmas, showed up this week, with obvious alterations......implants, botox, maybe even a tuck here and there.......her skin looked almost stretched over her facial bones it was so snug.......and her lips were swollen up like she was having an allergic reaction...her husband was obviously proud.....maybe it WAS her xmas gift........if i were ever to have altering surgury, it would be a reduction not an enlargement.....of course an unnamed soul close to my heart says that if i would just lose 20 pounds, i wouldn;t need a reduction........

      ok, so the m.m. is moving out of the comfort zone and into the next level of her professional life....major expansion.  .we had 3 new people start work last night, and a new person started last week.......so from the get-go there is much confusion in the kitchen and lots of explaining/direction to be given.......communication may be the toughest challenge, as the 2 lunch time kitchen helpers are both deaf, but the new evening kitchen helper CAN hear but doesn't understand much english and is unfamiliar with many american ways of doing things.....he is from cameroon, studying at midway in the nursing program...last night both the deaf dishwasher and the cameroon dishwasher were there, and i got very confused as to who i had to motion/hand signal and who i could just verbally direct...we are hosting a required 4-hour alcohol training today, and hope to hire several more people from the pool who attend this training.....we will probably have a separate crew for lunch and for dinner, with both helping out at catered events.......change is good, but change is unsettling by its very nature.......extra people will surely change our dynamics as a working team and we may lose the tight-knit atmosphere that has made coming to work thus far a joy.............

      ok, so i think i accidently deleted an email from my friend gail.......it would have come into my junk mail folder, as i have not added her yet to my 'good email' list....and i always just glance over my junk mail before deleting the usual rounds of enlargement potions and assorted porn pictures and get-out-of debt schemes.........hopefully she will send her message again.....

      ok, so the mean mamma hopes to welcome her friend gail to her audience of gentle readers........again, danville schools have a 1 hour delay, but the m.m has no delay...she must finish this cup fo coffee and get to work and cook some rather large carryout orders as well as lunch.....happily, tonight our new chef and assistant start work, so there will be plenty of helping hands in the kitchen for whatever supper crowd shows up......this morning, though delayed has not been without drama.....my almost 10 years old came down in a pair of jeans so tight she could hardly walk, and when asked to change them she insisted that they weren't too tight........alas, when she tried to take them off, after much debate, she found that she couldn't undo the top button, and had to ask the m.m. to do it...the mm who was obviously wrong about them being too tight.........ironic, isn't it, that both baggy and tight are in style......one extreme too snug for adequate breathing and the other to the point that drooping clothing no longer covers undergarments......what ever happened to wearing clothes that fit????????

      ok, so we are fully booked for pre-centre dinner tonight, plus we are catering for 100 people at 3:00 am....and another 200 at 11:00 tomorrow and another 120 at 7:00 tomorrow night....we would send in our liquour lic.application  today, but we spent the money we set aside (mega-bucks...) to pay for the lic. on the all the improvements that the fire inspectors et al required before they would sign off on the application.......how is that for a catch-22...now we need several really bifg days to get us caught back up and we will have that sucker in the mail......

      ok, so i am rereading the hours by michael cunningham, pulitzer prize winning author that wrote the book on which the current movie is based.......it is a book for virginia woolf buffs, of that there is no doubt...i have a hard time believing that the average joe off the street will enjoy the movie without first having read mrs.dalloway, the book on which the hours is based, ;let alone the hours itself.......the 3 women in the movie/book do not actually meet each other, and are not on screen together......but each are essential to the plot.....there is a place in the third chapter at which i burst out laughing, in the hot bathtub, no less........the meryl streep character..clarissa dalloway...is standing on a corner waiting for a traffic light, holding a bouquet of flowers......there are two girls also waiting...and debating on the movie shooting taking place across the street and down some......'i think it was susan sarandan' says one ot the other.......no i think it was meryl streep. says the other.....in the movie they must have surely included this joke, as meryl streep is standing right beside them when the line is said.......maybe they chose her because of the mention in the book, or maybe because the role called for a truly intense female.......i hope that i have not already blogged on this....i am getting older by the moment, it seems.....

      ok, so our new dishwasher asked me if i was my partner's mother...........an old joke, as i am older than my partner's mother, and will be older still at the end of the month.......february, for the last 2 years,,,has been bad for birthdays....as it rollsa round after the visa bill comes....containing the latest rental car problem......last year the benzene rather than the diesel ($400) and this year the scraped right back rear panel ($620) which means that my renting a car in europe has a direct impact on my birthday tributes........of course.......going to europe most years should be birthday gift enough, but that is beside the point.....next trip i will not , i repeat not, rent a car.......

      ok, so more obstacles to the elusive liquour license...we do not have enough parking based on the square footage used by the fire marshal to verify our seating capacity...what a catch-22...if we had less square footage we would need less parking but we could not justify our 100 seats......so now we must petition planning and zoning for a parking variance.....we have more than freddies....but we are in the same boat...downtown we can only count parking we either own or rent...we cannot count on-street parking........i am so frustrated...we also have to pave the alleyspace outside our emergency exit.....because it is dirt and the fire marshall says that nobody can escpae fully through our emergency door onto dirt...they must escape onto concrete.....  on a happier note, we have hired our weekend dishwasher..he is from cameroon and speaks french as a primary language.....he is related to centre's bio-chem instructor and goes to midway during the week......i asked him if he wanted coffee 'en francais' when he came into interview, then commented that jerry was late by saying is est tard,.....which scw says was incorrect...it should have been il est en tard......or that is what i think he said.......anyway, the weekend chef recently took a spanish class to help him speak to immigrant workers, and we hired one who speaks french.......we are working with the weekend chef on his new menu....he has several beef dishes, a veal dish, a marinated pork medallion dish, and red tuna as a seafood offering.....sounds good so far.....after everybody is trained on friday night, saturday lunch and saturday night, i will only have to be there if there is a special event.....like a wedding or extra dinner.......i will believe it when i see it.......

      ok, so we are getting close to cayle's birthday, which means we are getting close to the 'birth mother's visit'........this is an annual, stressful event, which has us anxious from beginning to end....mostly because cayle gets very anxious from beginning to end......when her birthmother leaves, as she must do, cayle feels abandoned all over again..........

      ok, so this afternoon i made the rounds of my favorite lexington area boutiques......which means i shopped at the best of the best goodwill stores......for kids clothes, the goodwill cannot be beat...i bought 8 pairs of size 12 and 14 girls jeans and khakis for a total of $16.....last week i paid $31 for 2 pairs of new jeans.....given the rough treatment they will receive, the goodwill price makes sense......in fact, the goodwill pants are in better shape than the last load i delivered to the danville goodwill as a donation...she has really torn up the knees.......none of the real deals like last time...not like the time when i bought cayle a leather bomber jacket for $4.....or an express velour vest for $1.75.......nevertheless, cayle's closet will be full again when they all come out of the dryer.......

      ok, so the subject of the sunday school lesson this morning was regrets......we were asked to make a short list of regrets at the beginning of the lesson......i started to record things that were job related....like staying too long.... or things that were romantic-related....like old boyfriends that i should have dumped sooner.....but decided that these are things that happened along the path that brought me to this very place.....and i cannot count them as regrets if they brought me to this family, in this house, in this life i now lead........no, i can only count as a regret those things that i did or did not do that had no affect on the outcome...for example, i regret that on our 3 week honeymoon, ecw and i chose to go to the riviera rather than vienna...i can see us in the car in innsbruck.....i thinkng of going on to vienna, but ecw thinking about the great time he had in st. tropez and wanting me to see it.......of course, by the time we got to st tropez it was rainy, littered, and unremarkable......i have never yet made it to vienna.....and i regret that i have not done so......i could remedy this at any time, i suppose........maybe next january?

      ok, so today was a difficult day, when you get down to it.....i took a load of boxes to kathy clark's on the way home from work ....she is moving now that jeff passed away in january,.....next to our old babysitter margaret jean mcguire...on boone trail.........jeff passed away suddenly...in january...while we were away in spain.......he had been in pain forever...but no one thought his time was up........this morning ecw disclosed to me that he had been up since 4:00 with chest pain....and that he intended to see rick hempel about it.....i hung on til 10:01 and then started calling......what was up.....by 10 he had already had an ekg and bloodwork...rick thought it was esosphogeal...like heartburn.....his ekg and bloodwork were good..in the night .he could only find 1 real aspirin in    the house, so by 10 i had collected a vat of real aspirin........i am not ready to be a widow, like kathy clark, at less that 50 years of age.......she spoke of his death sunday, in sunday school....about how on new year' day she and caitlin and jeff and casey had dinner together, not knowing that it was a last supper........this was yesterday, when she was telling about their last supper.....and this morning my spouse was telling me about his chest pain......i have spent the day in a state of dread.......dread that our time is up.,.....he told me that he did not wake me up because he knew i needed sleep......well...i would have awakened to his cold body and thought.........thanks for letting me sleep.............yeah right..........he is asleep right now....and i am freaked out that his chest pain is heart related, just like his mother's.......we spent supper discussing as i lay dying versus the corrections.......only i had read thoroughly each book....scw and ecw were only part-way through each.....which is unfair.......the clarity was there for me.......but not for them....yet........they will have to finish both books before time is up.....it is only fair....................

      ok, so we finished early at work today, so i came home, found as i lay dying under the bed, and finished it for april book club........let me get this straight.......when they finally get to jefferson to bury the mother, the father takes the daughter's abortion money and uses it to buy false teeth so he can marry the woman who already owns a gramaphone........meanwhile the only sensible brother is sent to the insane asslyum at jackson when he tries to burn down the barn, and the brother who thinks his mother was a fish continues to believe that this is true...and the brother with the broken leg eats bananas whilst laying on his mother's coffin, and the mother's favorite jewel continues to resent his favored place........yes, this book must be a classic because it is so simple yet convoluted.....i recall when i first moved to danville there was an article in the paper about banned books, and this book was listed as a book that many libraries banned......why? because of dewy dell's abortion money used to buy pa"s false teeth? or because vardamon confused his dead mother with a dead fish? or because darl burned down the barn so his family could give up the quest and go home?  the book was on the shelf at the young-rodes library when i checked...i didn't read it at the time because i was unaware of faulkner...........i was into colette at the time, and having read faulkner, still prefer colette......her sexual themes are more profound, easier to recognize, and happen in paris rather than rural mississippi.......i guess i could better handle a brother mistaking my dead mother for a fish if i was in paris.........rather than in the mud in the boondocks.......mark my words, my book club will love this book, where they disliked collete.........there is no accounting for taste.........

      ok, so i am a headliner......i read mostly headlines, especially when it comes to war news.....iraqi general captured.....us troops hold south bank of euphrates.....that is about the extent of the information about this war that i can handle......the car bombing really upsets me..the potential for all that to start here in the u s of a........though the terrorist threat would seem less in danville than in bigger cities....a terrorist attack in a small place like this would certainly freak out the entire country...which is the point of these episodes...to paralyze us all with fear......  ...as i sit here, in my flannel nightshirt and eating my favorite breakfast (leftover tabouli with chickpeas and roasted red peppers) i blame pres. bush senior for most of this mayhem.........he abandoned the kurds and the shiites after the last gulf war, so they are unlikely to rally behind us now......and i blame the current pres. bush, for acting like a crazed ditctator in his own right......'we'll have a war if i say we'll have a war' is not the best way to get others to rally around your dirty little war......

      ok, so i have spent the past 2 days downloading led zep songs.,,,,,,,putting two and two together...i read some time ago that led zep was remastering some of its old songs for the lotr soundtrack.....obviously it wasn't for 1 or 2 so it must be for the end...........#3..........sounds right, having listened to lyrics from ramble on, over the hills and far away, misty mountain hop.......it could yet be done........even stairway to heaven could fit........the battle of nevermore.......oh yes...it could yet be true........

      ok, so mm gets no respect.........i recycle every bit of recyclable material at trc....in my van...5 days a week.....and because my van is somewhat rode hard and hung up wet my spouse is angry at me.......this van was once new and pristine.....and now it is not.....somehow saving the earth one load at a time and having a clean van do not compare in importance.......

      ok, so i am not working tonight, and i am so glad to be home...........i am not, however, watching uk play....i weeded instead.....so many weeds and they come up so much more easily when the ground is wet......i am bummed because some of my oldest roses have died over the winter.....blairii#2.....gone.........new dawn......dead .........and some roses whose names i did not even get attached to are dead as well........all the martha stewart roses i bought on a whim are dead, but this does not surprise me somehow......they are grafted, and easily killed......as opposed to my old roses which are on their own roots, and harder to kill........

      ok, so the digital camera has arrived, and scw is reading the book so that he can tell us all how to use it.......i dreamed that we couldn't find the cable that connects the camera to the computer.........we searched everywhere for that cable...there were women wearing black leather having a reunion of some sort in my house, as well as a judges conference........go figure what all that has to do with my missing camera cable......i checked this morning....it is actually in the box..........

      ok, so our spring break plans are starting to gel.....i faxed my reservations today for hillwood, marjorie merriweather post's estate in washington dc........noted for its gardens as well as its russian collection...faberge eggs, icons....etc.......her first husband was the american ambassador to russia right after wwI,...so she came home with a load of loot.......to visit, reservations must be made in advance, presumably so they can run backround checks.....i visited several years ago..i had to disclose my address in dc, even if it was a hotel, and i could not visit on the day i called....they made an 'appointment' for later in the week....like a dental visit.......the family money came from post cereals......and she married well........her daughter (only child) was the actress dina merrill.....the merrill of the wall street investment bank was one of her husbands........anyway, scw and i were slated to go there last spring break, but my mother-in-law died so we went to the funeral in cincinnati instead......the same day we are also going to dumbarton oaks, an estate in georgetown owned by harvard. and noted for its byzantine and pre-columbian collections.........we will also take a turn through georgetown u. while we are in the neighborhood........   i have made an interior decorating decision....i have decided on fabric for drapes and armchair covering........my mother will locate it on her 4 state mission trip with her sister-in-law......she has the swatches and the store locations, and the knowledge about how many yards..........the current chair and drapes in question were in place when we brought scw home from the hospital, so i believe i can safely replace them without guilt........the fabric is grass green ground with flowers in rust and burgundy and purple.......very happy......  i am home early because our evening kitchen help turns out to be quite capable.......the new guy, tommy, was making cute garnishes as i was leaving.....a good sign.........of course, they are all new guys, so to speak......no one working at night, except jerry and i, have been at trc longer than january.........most less.......but they each came with experience.........somewhat annoying is the constant topic of conversation in the kitchen......food.......iron chef, bobby flay, emeril.......i am not so into food that i want to discuss it 24/7..........worse, none are readers..........well, that is not the worst thing...they are all so much younger than me....i feel so old these days.........

      ok, so we at trc now have a dsl line.....with this line we were able to consolodate our phone,data and fax lines from 3 to 2, with an actual savings of about $40/month........life is good......or at least as regards internet....last night, with uk playing during dinnertime, we had only 5 walk-in customers for our thursday evening mealtime.....thankfully, we had 2 groups with reservations....one with 75 and another with 15, so the evening was not an entire bust.......saturday night when uk plays will be another story.....i may bring a book.....another book, as i am done with the corrections........so many of the scenes depicted in that book brought back painfuil memories of past unpleasantness, with both my family and with my in-laws....................i need to go back to my usual genre...murder mysteries......so much less cathartic but much for enjoyable for the escape.......

      ok, so my youngest child is wearing a sleeveless shirt and shorts to school, despite the 38 degree temp outside.....she is hardly convinced that she should wear a jacket over it all to school...........if i made her wear that get-up on such a cold day....it would be considered child abuse.........

      ok, so tonight i finally accomplished the ultimate download........karla bonhoff home.........this song is one that ecw and i used to sing along with in his old pinto...oh....25 years ago......i love this song.....guitar, mandolin and karla and maybe a back-up singer or two.......very retro bluegrass....karla wrote some of james taylor's songs, by the way...similar genre..........i think i will listen to it again just one more time.......  this morning cayle got up at 6:25, got dressed and came downstairs to watch the war on tv........there is something essentially disturbing about watching war on tv.....at any age.......something that horrific should not be viewed in realtime......not that i am not keeping up with it all....a keep tabs on cnn.com....just the headlines....i am not prepared to read about the gruesome details just yet..........

      o,, so the corrections is becoming painful, especially the parts where it is clear that all the mothers and fathers  involved have their favorite children and their least favorite children....there was a scene in which a least favored child had to sit and stare at his liver and bacon until he gave up and ate it (he fell asleep at the table)...the liver and bacon meal had been made in punishment by the mother toward the father, because he left her alone with the children for weeks at a time while he traveled on business.........the favorite child was forgiven the liver and played pingpong with daddy......this is painful because my brother was the favorite child to my mother's people.....he was the only grandson.......my aunt and uncle,,,to this day,,,dote on him.........he spent thanksgiving with them rather than with us, or his own mother.......i have no idea where this book is going, but it is sure to be a cathartic place.......

      ok, so meanmamma is enjoying this book.....the mother, enid, reminds me so much of my late mother-in-law.......in this scene, enid is having lunch in the new york apartment of her son chip, served up by her daughter, a philly chef....despite the poached salmon on the table, she continues to drone on about a housewarming party she recently attended (ex-classmates of chip) that featured a pyramid of shrimp........the implication,  my own children who moved away are not nearly as successful as those who stayed behind in our little home town......or something equally as obtuse......i have a simlar memory of my m-in-l's first visit to trc.....she droned on and on about a wonderful meal she had at the restaurant in cincy owned by my brother-in-law greg's then boss.......not a word about the meal she was consuming....just about that stellar meal.......like it was a gift from the gods......of course,  that restaurant is now bankrpt, greg got fired, and my nondescript little place is int he black and chugging right along........so do we kin to women like enid succeed just to prove the enids of thw orld that we are worth noting and praising on our own merits?     back to the book.......

      ok, so blogger did eat my last blog.....the one where i rant about how girl's size 7-14 clothing now comes in plus versions.....and the one about how much i like jonathan franzen's book the corrections..the one that oprah chose for her book club and franzen declined her invite.......that was the one that was lost......ah well........we are trying to plot out our spring break....and i am out of my element when it comes to factoring in 4 people,,,,,,,,actually 6 people..us (all except acw) and ecw's brother nick and his wife......i would say 7 people, but my brother stuart never responded to my email telling him i was coming......he is surely 'tied up with the war' and unavailable......so i have not planned the first thing.......because we do not know how much time nick can give us, given his brain tumor, treatment. etc........i do have a list of things i want to see....monticello for the umpteenth time.......except this time we know a docent who can get us a tour of the ballroom under the dome.......and hillwood, margorie merriweather post's home in dc.....and dumbarton oaks, also in dc and owned by harvard........alas, in the timeframe given, neither of the dc homes are open on mondays........we also want to visit some colleges.....uva, st. johns, william and mary, georgetown........i know that st john's does not have a school of architecture, but they do require that students learn ancient greek........and i consider that a plus......jefferson went to w&m, and founded uva's library and designed their buildings......if scw went to georgetown he would see my brother about as much as i do her in ky.........cayle has never been to williamsburg, where the crepe myrtles will be in bloom.......i have been there at least 7 times........i am drawn by the boxwood...i find the scent intoxicating........and by the gingerbread cookies baked fresh in back of raleigh tavern.......by the way........dr. rick hempel, my friend.....is the only person i know personally who is a member of phi beta kappa....the honorary founded by t. jefferson and others in the raleigh tavern............the trip may become a whirlwind....i foresee much driving......but i will not be the main driver on this excursion..........

      ok, so i completely missed a monday blog.....the opportunity never arose at home nor at work.......we were quite busy for a monday, and were missing no less than 3 employees..........one was awol on her first day.........it went well regardless..........i regret that i didn't see adrian brody receive his oscar.....i also regret that i have not seen the pianist.....i have seen spirited away...which won for animation.....of course, the competition was not stiff.....ice age?  that film had few moving parts.......

      ok, so ii am listening to counting crows...a long december...while i procrastinate.....i am supposed to be studying my sunday school lesson, as i teach this morning.......i am a bit disconcerted, having read the letter to the editor this morning that said something to the effect of so-called christians who own restaurants that serve alcohol should be worried about when they meet their maker at the last judgement.......i have taught sunday school for at least 12 years, which means that i have read the Bible at least once a week for that time-frame......Jesus said many things, but he never once addressed drinking alcohol nor owning a cafe that does so..........i also believe that when he raised his cup with his disciples at the last supper, there was real wine in his glass......not grape juice.........he personally turned water into wine...not just ok stuff but better than the groom's father had purchased for the wedding at cana.....clearly, i do not mind that the letter writer has not and will never eat at my restaurant.......that is his right...........but when he gets it in his mind that he is holier than the rest of us because he doesn't drink alcohol or enter businesses that do, i beg to differ.........

      ok, so we may have had our first abc 'test' person come in to day.....a car of 4 came in about 2:00...and each ordered, but only 1 was old enough per id.....after that 1 person had a beer, they all left, saying they really wanted a cheeseburger......we will not know when the abc actually comes, but we do check id's carefully just in case......

      ok, so i was reading about the war this morning on cnn.com.....they have a special section called wartracker.........kind of like stormtracker only deadlier........i did not click on this section, because i did not want to encourage cnn in their desire to draw additional readers through the use of 'special sections'.........i didn't actually read any of their articles....just read the headlines and quicky concluded that this will not be over quickly, and that little will be left standing in iraq when the war is finally over.......  on to more important things........it got cold last night...and the c-w's have already taken off the down comforter.......whup........spring is such a changable season....cold some days...hot as all get out on others........hard to dress without being too hot or too cold in the end......it is chilly this morning......i am going to take a quick walk around my garden, then get ready for work......

      ok, so tonight at trc, a family that i have known since scw was in preschool were eating supper...........the daughter was in town on spring break from a private school, and when i asked if she had called her friends from the montessori and danville systems while she was home, she blushed.....no i was riding horses in indiana with my friends......she did ask about scw....and then the conversation turned to travel.....where will you go next january, now that france and most of europe is anti-american.........even italy has had protests........thankfully, i also saw madame goodwin, one of my favorite people, also at supper...she and i commiserated about the state of world affairs, and decided that we could never write off france as a destination........  on a connecting note, i came home needing a book to read, now that seabiscuit has beaten war admiral after numerous preamble chapters.......i picked up a book i have read before.......Off the Road, by Jack Hill...a memoir of mr. hill's pilgrimage to santiago de compostela......this past january, i and my fellow pilgrims crossed the route.....we knew because we saw the sign.................we did not see any actual pilgrims, probably because it wa january, and the point of the pilgrimage was to arrive just before july 25, the feast of st james.....given this global insanity, i believe that i could take a pilgrimage walk across northen spain......even though i understand little of the language, share no fondness of the food nor wine, and lack the basic fanaticism about soccer...........however, the scenery is compelling........and the heritage is intriguing...........and the potential for self-reflection is ripe.........but then, can a pilgrimage be done in week-long bytes......how many 1st-week-of- januaries would it take me to walk across northern spain?  i am not catholic by any stretch of the imagination.  what would i say to the priest when i got to the end?  hiya, don't mind me if i skip out on communion.........i was intrigued by the books beginning....in the cloisters in nyc.....i have never been there....maybe that is my first pilgrimage....to nyc to see the cloisters re-erected so generously by jd rockefller.........would i be safer in nyc than in paris? or rome?   ah well.   meanmamma continues to keep the goodmamma of the l.o. in her prayers.......prayer is about all we have these days.........

      ok, so i am nervous as a cat over this war........i cannot believe that we actually pulled the first trigger.......i have always believed that the us of a was a strong defneder but not an aggressor......i  was wrong.......i can't help ut think that gwb si trying to finish what his daddy started but couldn\'t finish........i hope it is over soon.......  we are getting a canon digital zr70 camcorder...it is not in the professional range of camcorders, but we will have it on hand when we visit brother nick in dc over spring break...that that is important to us...to have him on tape...our videos of my dad and my grandpa are quite old, but at least we have them...we also have ecw's sister sylvia and his mom and dad on old video...but many of his siblings weren't around during our brief video years....and we want to have something to remember them by......nick's brain tumor is one of those unknowns...we want to see him at his best before he is no longer himself.........

      ok, so i went shopping last night.....rather than sit and wait for the fighting to start......scw and acw and i found several bargains before we moved on to best buy to look at digital video cameras.......i picked up the one for $1199 first...it was so small that i could barely focus my eyes through the viewfinder.....and the controls were so small that i could barely press them without pressing another control close-by.....hopwever, the quality of picture was much better than the ones for $599 and $699, which the best buy guy suggested 'and better suited 'for my needs'....these both do sepia, and stills, and will download onto a computor equipped with the right software.......he said that the still were not printable quality,,,and said that for the price difference we could get a decent video camera and a decent still digital camera for less than the $1199 camera.......hmmmmm....we just need to convince grandma that herb would have wanted us to be completelt decked out digitally.....my dad would have enjoyed the digital age.....i have fond memories of him splicing movie tapes together(movie film rolls were notoriously short) in order to make a smoothly progressing vacation film........he bought himself an apple when they first became available to consumers, and spent a great amount of time teaching himself how to use it......anyway, we liked the way the jvc felt to hold...much easier to hold.......now we must scour the consumer reports to make a decision and present the price points to grandma.....speaking of herbert crown, scw wore a completely osu color scheme to school today...scarlet and grey.....herbert would have been so proud........though he would not have wanted scw to actually go there, necessarily........herbert would have actually read the college mail coming to our house.......brown, amherst, yale.......herbert would have also been inclined to go to their web sites and learn about each school (whether they have architecture, for instance) .....i have thought a lot about herbert in recent days.......especially as we are on the brink of war.....he spent 2 years in occupied japan...where americans were not welcome at all.......i cannot imagine what my grandmother must have felt...shipping 3 sons off to war....vernon to india, herbert to japan, and richard to a navy ship somwhere in the southeast.......i occupy my anxiety with finishing seabiscuit.......................

      ok, so i have watched the end of the sec tourney and the big ten tourney......and i am convinced that college sports exists not for alumni but for people who never made it to or through college.....ecw's step-grandmother is a case in point------aunt ginny, henry ernst's third wife who watched ky b-ball faithfully when she inhabited this house, called the uk teams 'her boys' even though she never went to college........at the sec tourney, a crazy woman dressed to the hilt in blue(sequins, mardi gras masque, jewelry.....) was interviewed by the press....i would bet my bottom dollar she never attended uk.......so if so many non-alums root for college ball, why not for the intelectual schools....why wasn't this crazy woman crazed over harvard or yale or princeton? locally, people who root for danvfille probably went to danville,and people who root for boyle probably went to boyle. i, for one, have always been out of step of uk bball....i can recall going out to dinner with ecw's original bike shop partner and his family..naybe 20 years ago......this little girl knew the starting lineup for uk...and i didn't even recognize the names........ah, well, illinois beat osu, my alma mater, decidely....it would be too much to ask for osu to win national championships in both football and bball.......of course, if osu gets in on the ncaa tourney, you never know...........osu breeds as many non-alum fans as any college team......my mother has a slew of scarlet and grey pieces of clothing, and she never attended the first class there...she went to o.u., which has the colors of green and white and is rarely seen on the national sports scene......so she has picked a team more likely to win as her 'team' . an aside, my mother has an extensive collection of crowns, a name that is not technically her own......she recently lowrated scw for neglecting to do heritage research on her family.....ironic in that he did so much legwork for our tip to the stephans of lambsheim...... one could say that these teams give hope to the people who never had the chance to go to college......one could say that.....but these days financial aid is so prevelent(sp?) that lack of money is only an excuse for young and mature students alike...... maybe team fans should be asked to wear one color if they are alums and another color if they are just fans.....just to help us all keep track........uk grads could wear blue, and non-alums could wear white with blue trim.....and no one would wear blue sequined mardi gras masks..........

      ok, so tonight we were packed, to the point that we had to turn people away who had not bothered to call ahead........we had a sorority dinner at 6, for 70 people, and a birthday party for 30 at 7, so there were only 30 available seats at the get=-go for supper, and those were taken before friday rolled around......jerry had a woman cuss him out at the door today because she couldn't walk in at 5:45 and get a table.......now, for the record, weekdays are not nearly so busy, and we miss our friends who used to  order a soup/salad combo or maybe quiche but usually roasted vegetable pasta salad.......this centre prof duo have not been in for some time and our wait staff are (is?) beginning to ask why..............since we got our liscense, the only centre people who have been in are the president and his wife and they barely drink.......speaking of liscenses, i was told tonight that danville is prepared to redistrict it's voting precincts to prevent applebees from leaving town.....i had not thought of that.......i guess that is why i am not in politics.......  one last thought before i go to bed......thanks to scw who was thoughtful enough to pick daffodils for me, knowing that i was working late and they would make me happy.......

      ok, so i dreamed last night about being at my grandmother crown's house, with assorted crown cousins, and the ingredients for spinach salad..this is certainly not an actual memory, as my crown relatives were into cole slaw and jello salads(with or without cool-whip)......the action, so to speak, took place at the house my grandmother bought 'in town' after my grandpa died....2 doors down from the church in a community of 3 streets that once was a port on the ohio canal.......i had brought mandarin oranges, which were wrapped in cellophane in my dream.......and the rest of the action darts back and forth between the house in town and the farm, with running from the pond included, though i am not sure who was running........not scw, as he was never at the pond at the farm......scw does run well in videos, i must confess.........i do not think that the salad ever gets made, because the people bringing ingredients never stay long enough for completion of the task......   the new yorker came yesterday.....i enjoyed the short story immensely....about a family of five that caters for a living in the upstate mountains of ny.........sound like anyone we know.....family of five that caters......the youngest child, trying to help, pours cherry juice over 200 swordfish steaks as the father is preparing food for a wedding reception.....and things start to get crazy after that.......as a caterer i would have been mortified if that happened to me.......i also enjoyed the piece about perfumes on the very last page.......and the piece about the woman who writes about fashion for the international herald tribune.......

      ok, so i enjoyed the ist annual student film festival, sponsored by roots and shoots. i especially enjoyed rachel doing the mean old witch dance as she brought golem to life. i believe that i have seen that move somewhere ...........i also enjoyed attending the festival with my entire family, including acw who showed up unexpectedly............by the way, i also enjoyed hearing the counting crows version of big yellow taxi, and i am downloading it as we speak.......

      ok, so the pig-kissing photo in the paper really set me off yesterday......because it came about the same time that the email from the advocate arrived...telling me that if i wanted gov cup results in the paper i would have to write up the event myself and they would print it on the scrapbook page, in a few weeks as they are several weeks behind..presumably with pseudo-beauty pageants and the like......i fired off a letter to the editor first thing this morning......and while this letter was brilliant in every sense, it will not be printed.....the advocate editor has already apologized for the lack of coverage at the premier ky academic competition....and will print a news piece about it friday.......  a small group of reno's staff had a late lunch with us today....they are much in the same boat as us...they have not hired extra help as they do not know how long and to what extent the increased business will last....they are also working both lunch and supper....and they are also exhausted........they really made our day.....we hope they come back......

      ok, so....i was driving from my class back to trc tonight when terry gross, said......ok, so...........i almost wrecked my car............but she was interviewing some guy about yemen and it's position on the war....now that we are buying them off........and how many yemeni villagers are retired american citizens of yemeni descent with u.s. passports who simply went back to the old country to live out their days.........the yemenis are also the group most linked to terrorism........and fundementalist islam......... beleive that this war is a major republican mistake, and that we will all live to regret it........

      ok, so mm tried to email results to advocate-mess last night- received an email this morning from newsroom.....we haven't a clue what governor's cup is so you will have to elaborate......this event was covered in both today's lex herald and louisvile courier, so the danville paper people either do not read other papers or simply didn't make the connection.....alas.....even newsroom head john davis's wife helen was there yesterday..........

      ok, so mm is overjoyed that scw  placed 3rd in high school general knowledge at governor's cup beating the guy from dunbar who recently won the jeopardy teen challenge..........the fellow who won, frank guan beat him as an 8th grader when scw placed 2nd......they actually tied but frank got the tie-breaker.......scw also beat the guy from johnson county central who is fondly referred to as one of the evil twins.........i am so proud.......i am also shopped out....and well fed......i spent my in-between time looking at fabric samples in louisville to cover that pesky front-room chair and hassock)....i ate wonderful thai food last night at thai-siam just off watterson parkway on bardstown road, right across from sullivan university...i had the tofu special- fried tofu appetizer with a toasted sesame dipping sauce, lemon grass and tofu soup, and vegetarian pad thai with sauteed tofu.....sublime....until the couple with the baby came.....then i had the waitress box up what i had not yet eaten.........i also brought a carryout order for scw, who didn't finish testing til after 9:00 pm last night.........the academic festivities took place in the same hotel complex as the pomeranian convention.......so we were treated to people with tiny balls of fur on leashes.........they were there last year as well..........glad to be home..........ready to go to bed.............not ready to go back to work......

      ok, so i am listening to ani defranco and indigo girls singing midnight train to georgia....good old song.......i am so exhausted that i am blowing off sunday school...........i will take scw to the bus at 11, then drive to louisville.......i have cooked everything for monday lunch so my workmates need only warm up soups, quiches, etc.......i appreciate this gesture, as they will have 3 carryout lunches and 1 dine-in special supper for 20 that they are covering for me......however, going with scw to governor's cup is a tradition.......we always have lunch at a mall on gcup monday, then shop until awards ceremony.........that is, if there is time....the 8th grade season, when they won the state, there wasn't time for either shopping or lunch, and we were so excited we didn't stop to shop on the way home.....i am up for anything this weekend...mostly glad that i will have 2 full days off and someone else is cooking.......back to the restaurant.....supper last night went very well......we fed at least 80 people, and it went smoothly...and nobody drank too much, and most everybody ordered a glass or bottle of wine with dinner, and nobody complained......ecw's saturday running group was 'treated' to someone ranting about his lousy dinner on friday night at trc....the salmon was dry as a biscuit.....and when ecw challenged him regarding praising publically and critisising privately....this joker insisted that he had, in fact, spoken to the kitchen about his meal......when i followed up with the schotts, he had, in fact, been in the kitchen twice on friday night, both times insisting that his meal was the best he had ever had in danville..... the schotts are furious, as he is an aquaintance of theirs...... sue schott has been promoted at lowe's, so we will be hiring a sous chef to help rob, as well as an extra kitchen person to make salads and appetizers......that is what i have done non-stop for the last three nights.....the volume looks to be enough to justify someone doing this job so i do not have to work 14 hour days forever....gentle readers, if you know of anyone who wants to work thursday, friday and saturday evenings, (5 to10) let me know........we prefer someone with culinary experience and/or talent..........ok, so i am listening to guster all the way to heaven....which is very sweet..........scw has been quite busy with downloads, and we now have an eclectic mix of music to accompany my blogging........which is catharsis on my part.......i do not blog things i want or need people to know, but things i need to get off my chest and out of my head........too many things in my head as it is.......

      ok, so we have a serial wine caller........he/she (both appear to be on the line at once)  call up ands ask about the wine list......do you have kendall-jackson.........when we say no they hang up.......then they call back....do you have woodbridge?  no.......they ask what we do have...i say our house white is from toad hollow.....what the hell is that, they say.......and hang up.........such a 7th grade thing to do.......no wonder we don't let 7th graders actually buy wine.....

      ok, so this morning the crocuses(croci?) were blooming as i walked up to the mailbox....so sweet and so unexpected.....as i did not plant them there..........must be a nice little surprise from scw.........i took the bait and went to somethingawful..........i especially liked the saturday news feature about let's go camping you nerds........reminded me of the best of mad magazine.....i also liked the updated fun with dick and jane comics.......and yes, i did enjoy the updated axis of evil feature, with jacko's predicted move to a third world country (one 20 years behind in which people still think jacko is a superstar) where he will have a compound with a house of marble and burnt twigs........and that will be known where young boys enter and never return.......i would like to  propose that mattel capitliaze on all the jacko publicity...and come out with a line of mj dolls, about 20 in a series to show the transformation from child star to whatever the.........he is now.........mj would surely buy all that is porduced and then announce that skyrocketing sales validate his continued fame.....oh yes....there must be a tommy mattola doll, as himself and as the devil.........maybe even a playhouse featuring the neverland merrygoround where mj doll can ride the ride all the day long.....and a large plastic tree where mj can sit on an upper branch and contemplate his navel.......can't have a 'king'size bed and lots of little boy dolls, because that would border on porn.......

      ok, so the mm was visited by an old friend today, unexpectedly......she was in town with her daughter at the forensics thing....she went first to see ecw at db&f...then came over to the trc.....i have not seen her in years, though she and her husband still keep contact with kandy and dan.....we first met kandy and dan through cathy waugh and rocky cooper.......so long ago.......anyway, i have not seen her since she had a car wreck 6 years ago.....she is now in constant pain, says she....but we mostly talked about our gifted yet wild first-borns and our brilliant second-borns.......i will always remember cathy waugh for telling us when her baby would be born from the first day she knew she was pregnant....and darn if she wasn't right..........she really made my day.....with her candid opinions and reations and encouragement..........her first born goes to antioch in yellow springs, ohio......after centre turned him down......with a 32 act and a 1450 sat and alumni parents......

      ok, so the drinking has calmed down a bit on day 2.....only a few daquiris and a mimosa......i was starting to worry that danville might just go on a bender.......the phone was ringing at 8:00 when i got to work...the woman asked how much we charged for a 6-pack of bud-light...she seemed perturbed that we not only do not sell beer byt he 6-pack, but that she would have to buy a meal to get a single bottle.......she asked when was the soonest she could come over......and seemed perturbed that we didn't open til 11........oh my...........

      ok, so i cannot get the song by aimee mann out of my mind....the two fo us .......from some sound track sung with someone named michael penn.....it is so catchy that it runs through my brain like a broken record.........we're on our way home...we're on our way home......we are going home.....you and i have memories longer than the road ahead.......and so it goes......

      ok, so one of the first orders filled yesterday was for spinach quiche...........and a vodka on the rocks.....i personally cannot think of a worse food/alcohol combo.........whooooo......we actually sold more martinis yesterday than wine or beer.........who knew that danville was so into martinis...........i took out 2 entire boxes of bottles to be recycled......the alcohol business will make my personal recycling crusade problematic....as we speak, the back of my car is chock full of cardboard and boxes of bottles, and bags of glass and cans.......if ever i get stopped by the authorities, my car will smell so of spirits that they will surely insist i take a breathylizer........

      ok, so i am fantasizing about paris, and i may just have to go back next january.......now this will be a hard sell...as i have been to paris 10 times.....but......there are so many places in paris i have not been due to the company i have kept.....several small houses and museums i have not seen.....several gardens......entire districts........i have not seen the new library, nor  the le corbusier house/foundation.....i have not eaten\drank at any of hemingway's haunts.......i take that back..i have had breakfast at deux magots...does that count? the entire trip to spain i wished i was in france........of course, the trip to spain made my french seem almost understandable.....anyway, back to paris...so many side trips i have not taken........st. denis......rheims.......compeigne..........fontainbleu...well i have been to fontainbleu but it was closed on the day ecw and i were there.......i have not visited the gobelins factory, nor eurodisney.......so many things to see.........i think that paris is the most perfect of cities..........there are rose gardens i ahve not seen rosarie de hay will not be in bloom in january...........

      ok, so i am enjoying closer to fine with indigo girls, jewel, and sarah mclaughin (sp).......i really like the song closer to fine......i also like the part on this cover where jewel yodels..........too few artists yodel these days........i can remember going to a swiss festival with my parents years ago, and there was a yodeling contest.......the sound is so distinctive..........something i cannot see myself doing.......even after a few beers.....

      ok, so thursday will be crazy.....all three lex stations will be here in addition to danville, lex and louisville newspapers..channel 27 was here today doing background shots....we will be on tonight at either 5:00, 5:30 or 6.......we have had people come in today wanting just a drink........we are not a bar, so we will not sell just a drink...only alcohol with an order from the menu......the 27 guy jerry sanders was kind of condescending...he asked me on camera about how we will advise danvillians on what wine goes with which food...as they are unused to wine.......i corrected him abd said that danville is quite sophisticated when it comes to wine, and we have had to be quite careful inputting together our wine list to match that level of savvy......

      ok, so even my spouse claims that his mother never had an unspoken thought.....if it came to mind she said it.....so it should come as no surprise to my blood kin and to my cadre of readers that ecw chose a bride quite in keeping with his mamma's example.........keep this in mind when i say that there are those who are thinking about leaving the nest prematurely.........and to those young ones i want to voice caution.........yes, high school is a teenage wasteland.........you are certainly not the 1st to figure this out.........but it can remain a haven until you are ready to fly the coop....not intellectually, but emotionally....no one will argue that you have the brains to move on.......but until the hard veneer necessary to survive the real world has a chance to really crystallize, it may be wise to stick a little closer to home.......

      ok, so there is no angst like mm angst....now that ecw and scw have decided to finish their cross-america bike trip this summer...after school ends and before scw leaves for belgium..........i have concluded that i have to actually be there when they finish....so i have decided that cayle and i will fly into denver after the band festival is over (we are very busy that weekend)........and drive 690 miles or so til i find them and their tandem.......and be their sag wagon until they finish....we will meet up with them about the time they enter yellowstone........i really like this idea....and i have convinced my partner that he doing a very good thing by agreeing to cover for me/pay others to cover for me........they will finish the journey somewhere in wyoming (i cannot remember the name oif the town)  as they are riding east from oregon coast rather than west......the winds are presumably better that way........i am so excited to be able to be there for this monumental event.......

      ok, so danville is a small place, but today at cayle's soccer game i was asked by yet another parent of an 8th grader if i was disappointed with danville schools and was scw transferring to 1) centre 2) out-of-town boarding school 3) st. john's.....the latter is humerous, as they do not presumably transer in 10th graders.......but the scuttlebut is troubling.....i answered with my usual.....scw neither complains nor speaks of moving on before graduation......both statements are true....lets see what he says after american studies with ms scott.........who was acw's burr in the butt junior year........ he could not do anything to please her...let's see if scw can so better.........speaking of schol systems.....i read overe the exhaustive listing of boyle a and  b students in the paper today.........either the standards are different or the boyle students are each bloody einsteins..........  on a more interesting note.....i am studying up on paris.........i do believe that i need, rather than want .......to go to paris in january.........

      ok, so a yellow iris bloomed overnight, despite the frost.........i wasn't there yesterday when i weeded........last night the c-w's went out to eat......this just never happens, as there are always leftovers from trc to eat for supper.....but last night mm just wasn't up to eating her own cooking....so we piled in the van and went to gualulahara (sp), the new one with the l. liscense......they were packed, but we got a table within 1 minutes....alas...we were not done with ordering, receiving food, getting scw's dessert, or getting a check for 2 solid hours.......the wait staff looked shell-shocked, and were clearly not prepared for the volume, either in number of servers or kitchen staff.......i really felt bad for them, and had to restrain myself from getting up and clearing off tables just to help out........when we got home i walked on the treadmill and watched igby goes down....which i rented because it starred susan sarandon........this was a bizarre tale of famiy dysfunction.....kind of like catcher in the rye in some respects, like holden caulfield with a perfect older brother, so sister, a parent in the looneybin, and a mother meaner than me...certainly not a feelgood romance.........like the movie we watched friday night...sweet home alabama.....predictable, but i didn't lay awake wondering what it all meant.........

      ok, so i stopped on the wayhome from work to get movies and to get chinese...this time i opted for wok and go, because it is across from titlewave.......big mistake...it is not nothing like wah mei in harrodsburg.........i will not be going back to wok and go.......

      ok, so it is friday, finally.....of course, i still have to work tomorrow, but friday remains a milestone for the promise of sunday off........as noted yesterday, i found a neat apt. online..in the 3rd near the pompidiou centre......now i just have to convince my significant other that i really need to go to paris in january for a non-driving, non-manic stay of immersion in french culture..........  in other news, i am on a rose watch....i have 2 differetn bushes that look like they could bloom any moment...both are therese bugnet, a shrub that has a fuschia-colored double kind of floppy flower to it....only blooms once......the color of the yet-to-bloom buds is quite visible...all they have to do is to burst open......maybe a little warmth would do it......the rose watch is an informal competition with my brother-in-law nick in d.c.,,,who is the king of old roses and who gave me most of my bushes.....for some reason, my climate allows a tad bit earlier bloom season than his does........anyway, first bloom is worth at least a phone call..........

      ok, so mm has seen it all.......as i was reading the new gourmet, out on the deck with a glass of wine........i heard the unmistakable sound of someone talking on the phone........yes....it was someone fishing.....and talking on  the phone while he fished.........he was trying to cast and hold the phone under his chin/crooked neck......i can just see that phone flying out into the creek...never to be seen again..........

      ok, so i am so excited.....there has been a new vitamin discovery...the first in 50+ years......pqq, which stands for some sort of quinone ...it appears to be a b vitamin...who knows what b-number it will be......good sources are fermented soy, kiwi, parsley, green pepper and green tea..........the discovery was made in japan......they are the ones who discovered a new taste (savory....unami...) and now the newest vitamin........

      ok, so mm has gotten this wild hair about chilling out in paris for a week in january..l.there is an adorable apartment with 2 bedrooms available  near the rambuteau metro in the 4rd, near beauburg..it has a sofa bed, a bedroom with a queen bed and a bedroom with 2 twin beds...so it could sleep up to 6, though it is advertised as 4 people.......1080 euros a week.......not bad for that much space......

      ok, so discussion at book club was the most intense thus far...about whether the mother who died in as i lay dying was just plain mean or a tragic figure worthy of sympathy because she did not have access to birth control and the man she married turned out to be a lazy good for nothing.........obviously i agreed with the latter sentiment........the bundren family was quite a bunch of dysfunctionals.....the discussion turned to the likelihood that most families have their share of dysfunction if we were all honest about our troubled lives......no one took that bait......i, for one, did not see the point of telling this group just how dysfunctional my family can be.........

      ok, so as it is still technically earth day, i will go on record...and state that i have recycled every bit of plastic, glass, cardboard and metal that came out of trc over the past 3 years...and that the people at the boyle county recycling center think i am demon-posessed.....i see them 3-4 times a week, and they see my stuff the other days.......i oftren drop stuff off on saturday nights after closing...around 10:30 or so.....i call those 'daring midnight drops'.......i have even given up on turning off the van when i pull up.....or turning off npr.....i just leap out, open up the back end, pile up the goods, and drive back to work......after all this time i am annoyed that some of my staff have yet to 'get' what this is all about.........they still try to throw away pop cans....or mayonaise jars......and i still drag them out fo the trash for recycling...we save the earth one jar at a time............

      ok, so i have picked out a hotel in the marais.......for my tentative january trip to paris.....scw claims that i am incapable of a calm, non-frenzied trip to paris.....i may go just to prove him wrong.......well...maybe i could prove him wrong.....i have never been to paris and just lingered........and i have been to paris 10 times.......i have either gone with my parents for a few days, or my new spouse for an afternoon....or deedra...well...i took the train out of town nearly every day so when i was in town i was a madwoman..........and then 3 trips with bate....all carefully orchestrated with no free moments...and the trip with just us...the one that started in london with the chunnel crossing and ended in paris....well....that was also jam-packed..........scw does make a valid point....i visit paris like someone who will never return....and yet i do return......only to scurry about like a woman posessed........i love the stores, the museums, the cafes, the gardens......even in winter.......even when they try to pick my purse..........i long to tell you that my people are parisian, but so far we have no direct connections to paris.......just dubious relations to charlemagne......my mother-in-law posessed a discharge paper, signed by napolean, from some relative let out of prison during the empire..i guess that is dubious, as well......like being related to someone sent to australia as a thief............presumably sister elaine has said paper now, but she is not telling at this point...........on one of my bate trips. my mother-in-law asked if i could take a 1/2 hour or so and look up this paper in the library.......of course, it is in french, which i do not speak,and we were on a tight schedule...and she became quite annoyed that the entire bate escursion did not revolve around a napoleanonic discharge paper..........for the record, this is the same woman who would not tell me the address of the family home in baltinglass, ireland, presumably because i might actually go there..........anyway, back to paris...........it is the city of colette, my favorite author.......she dealt with the bad weather, and the changable political scene.....and got a state funeral outof it.......maybe i could just sit in the palais royale, outside of her windown. and read her books (en anglais) and get a bit of rest and relaxation.........

      ok, so i dreamed about making bread...all last night.....someone kept adding extra water, so i couldn't get the consistency right.......then someone kept moving the pans........so frustrating............i have been rereading one of my paris guidebooks.......there is so much of paris i have not seen because it was not of interest to 7th/8th graders or because the metro didn't run close by.....maybe i am due another jaunt to the city of light.......

      ok, so blogger ate a long entry yesterday, the one where i was feeling sorry for myself because my firstborn didn't come home for easter, and how his easter basket was sitting on the counter after lunch even though he lives but 36 miles away........but.......he did end up calling to wish us well and to let us know he was writing papers or he would have come home for lunch........i know that easter is not like christmas...and i know that eventually he will not even come home for that holiday...as he will be with his wife's family at some point......i might as well get used to this........maybe we will have to get into the habit of going away for holidays.....i would mind less about the children not coming homne if i were in hawaii or cruising new zealand.........

      ok, so my mother showed up for easter lunch, not with a rabbit or a chick...but with a puppy....a shetland sheepdog puppy named princess.....she had mentioned this arrival, but we were somewhat unprepared  for the reality of my mother buying a dog that we will end up raising....at some point.......however.....let's talk positive...my mother is quite transformed by the arrival......just tickled pink to have someone to take care of...and to dote upon.........this pup will be a very good thing, indeed...........

      ok, so i treated myself to a french farce, with subtitles, called le placard (the closet)...it is released by miramiax, so it was a safe bet....and absolutely hysterical.........it involves a nondescript fellow named pignon who finds out he will be laid off from a condom factory near paris.......to save his job, his next-door neighbor digitally adds his head to gay-bar photos, then mails the photos to the head of pignon's company....who freaks out.....if the gay community hears that they have fired pignon, they will assume it is because he is gay......and will boycott them.......the twists that come of this are guffawingly funny at times....i have watched it twice.......and depend on the subtitles.......they speak so quickly and in such hushed tones i cannot make out the syllables en francais...........please add to my epitaph....she wanted so badly to speak good french.......

      ok, so i catered a memorial/funeral service over near nicholasville tonight, for a friend of rick hempel's..and it turns out that he is an artist originally from lexington, named dan ludwig....who happens to know sheldon...small world....i didn't listen in on the actual service/remembrance....i had enough of the funeral/memorial service thing last fall and instead i sat outside and enjoyed the solitude for awhile.....the redbuds were quite lovely and there was a cardinal calling his mate...sweet.....

      ok, so last night i downloaded 4 months of blogs...working backwards.....my goal is to have a hard copy just in case......i sat up late rereading, especially the spain trip.....the entries were so hurried....now that time has passed i wish that i had not rushed about so much...that i had forced us to sit and just look and take-in and enjoy......but we wanted to see it all, in the lack-of-faith manner that travelers have...i might never be back so i had better pack it in now.......i so want to go somewhere this january...just don't know where yet.....

      ok, so i am listening to bob dylan singing forever young with bruce springstein......that song always makes me cry.......i have to take scw back into town soon.......then help ccw with her spelling......then watch the french movie i bought....the closet...with daniel autiel...it is supposed to be in french with english subtitles.....but i have my doubts as the cover is all in english.......i heard on the news this morning that the french are seeing a major dip in wine sales, and that they are blaming the boycott of french products because of the war....i think not.....i blame the aussies......they are going great guns with wine promotions...we have mostly aussie, new zealand, and oregonian wines on our list...just a few from france or california.......because the price and taste match up just fine and dandy.....the french outpriced themselves on many things years ago.......i guess they had a captive market......even the success of california vineyards did not cause the french to back off too much on price.....maybe the aussies will..........  ok, so it is official, i have been blogging for over 1 year...almost daily........i still enjoy it.....maybe not as much when i realize that i self-censor for fear of hurting feelings.....but i self-censor in most aspects of my life......it was only my late mother-in-law who never saw the need to watch what she said....she had no un-uttered thoughts......but then, i do not remember most of the things she said to me in a positive light.....i would hate to think that those who read this blog would remember what i had to say negatively........

      ok, so today is maundy thursday, and i plan to go to church tonight......the last supper fo christ with his disciples was on the thursday before easter sunday........it is always a touching service......easter has snuck up on me this year........despite its late date.....i have a new jacket to wear to church on sunday, though the skirt i intended to wear with it may not fit.......whup.....i have very pleasant memories of childhood easters...my parents would always wait to buy spring/summer church shoes for me until we went to cleveland to celebrate with my mother's parents.......we always went to the same store....which sold poll parrot shoes......the store had a parrot, by the way.....one year i had orange patent leather shoes......oh so 60's.........alas, this year i have no need for orange patent leather shoes.....i wear good shoes so infrequently (only on some sundays and never when i have enough tan on my legs to get by wearing sandals......) that i will probably wear the same pair of black pumps until i die.........ecw has my permission to bury me in them...or rather cremate me in them.......

      ok, passover begins today...not normally a holiday on my radar, but this year is different.....for starts, one of my new cooks is a converted jew (probably the only one living in Mitchellsburg as we speak)......he converted when he married his ex-wife, and has not reconverted since she left him and moved to china (not a good health move.......) so he keeps kosher, at least so far and not eating pork, and shellfish, etc........in d.c., i stopped at a giant food store to buy dessert and appetizers for dinner.....and saw my first ever big-bang passover food display...whoa......more than i ever dreamed was available for this holy day........as i am unsure just which herbs are bitter, and because i wasn';t totally paying attention this morning on npr when the first sandwich (the hil-el matzoh with apple and bitter herbs...?) was being discussed......i will not be doing the passover thing today........this is pure laziness......as i fixed corned beef and cabbage on st patricks day, and i am not irish ...years ago ecw and i attended a sadar meal with sally and robb dine-fitch (the artist jim dine's half-bro) ...it was very interesting.......i believe robb read the passages from the holy book......but that is all i remember. this morning when i trudged out to the road to get the paper at 6:50 am, the yard looked so beautiful, i wished that i could linger, with coffee, on the deck and just take it all in.......the perennials have taken over so much of the bedding square-footage that there is less and less to do each year when it comes to mulch...just the weeding of the wild onions.......all that is left is the back of the house, around scw's fish pond......which lacks fish at this time.......

      ok, so i have had 2 moments to think about this book, and i have a clear notion of how it will not play out on my life...for starts....the wife decides to give her husband dibs on the house if he will agree to host a wedding party for the daughter who marries unexpectedly in thailand........that will never happen...as  i will not leave my garden without kicking and screaming...............i do not care who lives in my house, but nobody else gets my garden as long as i am breathing........

      ok, so i just finished revenge of the middle aged woman........a british comedy/tragedy/light-hearted look at a woman who gets divorced and fired from her job as a book editor on the same day....well...not just the same day...but metaphysically so......at one point in this book i sat on the back deck and sobbed.........and i am not really sure why...something one fo their children said...or ex-girlfriend of the son said after her suicide........anyway.......this book is similar to bridgit jones diary in tone, but for the subject matter.....very british........semi-predictable ending.........hugh grant will certainly star as the husband who leaves......he is reaching that age bracket.......now just who will be the spurned wife? maybe emma thompson?............

      ok, so today i helped kathy clark to move, along with 6-7 other people from the boyle county schools or our sunday school class.........she is moving first to a furnished house, the home of a church fellow who has moved to mcdoweel place......very 60's decor......and by may she will move to the house she bought...ann yankey's house on boone trail.......i have been to this house many times when the boys were little...our sitter margaret jean mcguire lived next door...when she went to the races...during keenelands' fall or spring meet, she woulkd ask her next-door neighbor ann yankey to watch the boys...she would warn me to polish their shoes....... all this ended when scw went to montessori at age 3  ...and ann yankey committed suicide sometime afterwards......kathy has not mentioned this...the living in ahouse where someone has commited suicide......but given all that she has been through she may not mind at all.......anyway...kathy clark's idea of moing was to have people arrive invehicles and take stuff out of closets...into the vehicles...drive to the new house, and take things out and put them away...........not much in boxes.....casey was there with his hardly clad girlfirend who was not introduced..........he has a phenomanal amount of khakis and cotton buttondowns and ties..........in fact...i was amazed at the volume of clothing we moved for kathy for just 1 month........and ecw tells me have have too many pieces of clothing.....also there were the youngs......anne and her husband...who imet when we were all pregnant with our first-borns....in lamaze class......18 years ago.......so many years ago.....i mulched 1.5 truckloads of mulch today and yesterday.....the last part will have to wait..........i am so sore.......and overwhelmed...by kathy's need to move and by her stoic approach to the move.......i do not think that i would be so composed if i was moving my household after 20 years of marriage..and my spouses death......ironically...i am reading a book entitled....the revenge of the middle-aged woman...by elizabeth buchan...the story of a 40-something woman who loses her spouse and her job as a book reviewer the same day...........i do not know if it is trite or just entertaining just yet.........

      ok, so last night i watched impromptu, a film about the connection between george sand and frederic chopin.....george sand was a baroness who left her spouse and unhappy marriage to write novels...she was ahead of her time in that she preferred to wear trousers, to smoke cigars, and to love freely and often (scandalous in that day and age....) in this film she persued chopin shamelessly, not out of lust, but out of sincere awe for his music.....george sand once wrote.....we cannot tear out a single page of our life, but we can throw the whole book into the fire........she lived fully in a time when most women were bound by convention to their duty as wives, daughters, and mothers........it was her motherhood that broke off her relationship with chopin......he began to fall in love with her daughter after they had been together 9 years........another telling quote.......guard well within yourself that treasure...kindness.....know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to aquire without meanness.........she sounds like a woman i would like to know.......

      ok, so now that i have been home a few hours, let me fill you in on some of the trip highlights.....#1 the orchid greenhouse at hillwood.......just fabulous, with over 200 blooming plants..the scent was just breathtaking.....literally........#2 the gardens at williamsburg......especially the one with the topiary and clipped box edging.......#3 the house at monticello.......just perfect in proportion, decoration, views, simplicity.........there are few historic homes that one can say.....i could live here...i do believe i could move into monticello.........#4 the maryland crab cake i had at the irish pub in anapolis.......though it would have tasted better with a small glass of guinness, but we were going to tour a college and i felt that beer might set the wrong mood.......#5 the admissions office at st johns.....we walked inthe door and the firts person to speak to us looked quite like betty poland.......scw says not, but she was strikingly similar in coloration, height, hairstyle........and demeanor.....#6....the lunch at hillwood cafe......a lovely room done in peach/pink walls with white woodwork that accented a wallsize canvas (probably russian) of a peasant picnic.........i had a stuffed cabbage roll with a salad and black bread........with baklava for dessert......#7the garden center at monticello where we bought heritage seeds for both flowers and vegetables.......now all we have to do is to get them to grow.........#8 the 11-hour sleep we got at charlottesville...we went to bed at 9:00 as we were so tired, and we didn't wake up til 8:00 the next morning.......#9 the chinese dinner with nick and roseanne......with chinese beer and hot and sour soup...and lo mein...and good conversation.......#10 the short time at the beach....watching ccw and scw playing in the frigid sand.......#11 (last one) watching scw enjoy his new role as camera man......now all he has to do is figure out how to transfer to dvd........

      ok, so we are back from this break...and i am so glad......the weather was rainy and 35 or so the entire 6 days we were gone.......i wore basically the same outfit for most fo the time...just because it was warm.......we saw uva through the car window....as it was dark by the time we got to town....and the next morning it was rainy and cold.......monticello is always a pleasure..then on to williamsburg, where we opted not to pay for admission, because the youngest in our group had been so impatient and disinterested at monticello that we felt it would be a complete waste of cash.........and that is how it worked out...we were in the restored area no less than 25 minutes before she was bored and asking when we were going to eat again.......we did see the wren building at w&m...and looked around........on to chincoteague seashore, where cayle took off her shoes and socks, ran into the water, trotted back to the car, put back on her shoes and socks, then proceeded to play in the waves and sand despite the windchill of sub-freezing temp with her brother, whose lips were blue by the time he was made to come back to the car...he was determined to build a sandcastle...and build he did.........on to anapolis....where we had a bonafide tour of st. john's college.......of every building and nook and cranny...it does seem a place for someone who would like to learn greek and read the great books.......we had a marvelous visit with ecw's oldest brother nick and his wife roseanne..he showed no sign of his brain tumor....and has had a recent checkup that seemed promising despite the presence of the tumor.....he is planning to retire in november.......he sent back 7 rose bushes and and assortment of boxwood and perennials for a 'cottage garden' in my side yard.....scw and i spent a day in georgetown area of dc......saw hillwood estate, and marjorie merriweather post's russian collections and gardens.............lovely........so did i have a good time?  it was so good to get away.....i did read a great deal of my john adams book.......and found out a bit of timely trivia......on his second voyage to france to serve as ambassador, the boat left him and his two sons off in northern spain, and he was forced to travel by mule through towns like burgos and bilbao on his way to the french frontier......he actually wrote and posted a letter to his wife from bilbao......... i missed acw on this trip.....i have never before gone without him.....he is as good a traveler as scw......but it is over. and now i am home.....i am going to get a load of mulch after i leave scw off at the act test......and i plan to spend the next 2 days totally devoted to my garden.......

      ok, so i was worng about the navaho connection. lori prestewa was hopi, and her entire tribe mourns her passing.........the hopi nation lives close to the navaho nation.......i have been to arizona many times to visit my uncle ernie in cottonwood...p.o. box #1....he had lived there so long...........he was a good friend of barry goldwater, and my aunt ginger tells of meeting goldwater in ernie's front room, in her bathing suit covered by a towel.......i have both hopi and navaho jewelry upstairs, given to me by my arizona relatives.....though i never wear silver...it does not suit me......i have a very nice hopi ring and bracelet that i will sometime give my daughter, who doesnot seem to care about what suits........i digress.......

      ok, so the cake did not actually fall, but it did cause quite a stir before it was cut.....the mother of the bride approached my partner at one point and said.....have i had too much wine or is that cake leaning?    and jerry leaned to the side and said ...leaning?  no..............when the cake was cut and dissassembled, it was clear that the baker forgot to put columns in all four corners of the bottom layer......hence the lean when 3 more layers were put on top........

      ok, so tonight i have seen the leaing tower of pisa, or at least the theory of the leaning tower in practice....the baker for tonight's wedding cake arrived at 2 with the cake..for a 7 reception, no less, and from the get-go it was obvious that the cake was lopsided.......and after the baker was done 'setting it up' it started to lean,,,,,and lean some more...to the point that our servers came rushing in...the cake is leaning...we are afraid it will fall over.......parts are bulging where the cake is leaning....when it is cut into the pressure change may cause total implosion..........

      ok, so i have this sense of dread about this trip.....like something big will go wrong.......of course, i always think something big will go wrong when i fly....that is why i have to stay awake....to keep the plane up and flying steady.......my paranoia this trip focuses on the norfolk /chesapeake bay tunnel/bridge...i fear that the terrorists will use a car bomb to blow it up the very day and hour we are on it.......now i know that this is quite a longshot.......but i still cannot get it off my mind........

      ok, so mm leaves for vacation within 28 hours, or so, and she is quite and uncharacterisitically unprepared........for spain i was packed a full week beforehand........today i put in a load of laundry to assure that i will have clean underthings......not that i do not look forward to going away.....i certainly do.....but traveling domestically is not the challenge that foreign touring presents......shoo.....if i run out of clothing i could always keep an eye out for a goodwill........(others may quip that walmarts are for just such occassions, but i am on a non-walmart roll, and have no intentions of breaking down just yet) the truth is...we will  be gone only 6 full days......in weather ranging from 55-75....a pair of shorts or two, several pairs of khakis......5 shirts......and i will be done...this basic trip is one that i made with acw and scw at least 3 times in years past....when ecw could not get off work......this basic trip is one i made in high school once and in college once and in grad school once......with different people but always the same sights...monticello, williamsburg, something in dc, i have a collection of pewter jefferson cups purchased at a rate of 1 per visit to monticello....each of my boys have 2 cups (on one trip that included ecw, scw was a toddler and make such a ruckus the tour guide asked ecw to take him outside.....i ended up taking scw someplace other than inside the gracius mansion, as ecw had never been there.........and we didn't make time for the gift shop on that occasion)......so 1 more day of work, and then we are off.......i am clearly out of the mood to work, so it is good that most of the food for the wedding tonight has already been done........just the arranging part is left for most of it......4 separate food stations......lots of kale and red cabbage garnish around the vegetable and cheese displays.....you know the look........i had purchased several books for the road, but i will not start them until i finish john adams.......)

      ok, so i am at the part of john adam's biography where he and john quincy adams (age 10) are picked up by a ship under cover of darkness well north of boston...to go to france to implore the french king to support the americans in their war of indepedence.....from the get-go....this entire thing was deja-vu........the british contend that the war is unpopular...supported by only a handful of renegades......but the brits engage in some heinous shows of force, which rallies the side of the underdog.......adams arrives in paris, where he and franklin are put up...at no cost....by a rich guy who stands to make a fortune with government contracts for war-related provisions........sound familiar?  they are staying in passy, which is part of my parisian fantasy..when i win the lottery i will buy a place just off the metro station la muette, in passy, on the park just before the musee marmatton.....which is just before the bois de bologne.........i digress........so adams and franklin are in paris trying to sell the war to the enemies of the brits......and france does side with the americans........recently..i heard someone say...in contempt...that they couldn't understand how the french had let us down, after we saved them in wwII.....frankly....wwII made us even...the french saved us in the revolution.......  i must confess that reading about john adams and john quincy adams is too much like george bush and george w. bush.........i cannot read the words without thinking of the names transposed......happily, john quincy adams seems like a brighter bulb than gwb.......harvard rather than yale.......with better than a c average............

      ok, so acw surprised us last night by coming home to do his laundry and going back to uk this morning......he must have wanted to see us before we left for spring break........of course, we both gave him money.....it seems like his trip may have been for more than jovial parental attention.......no problem...my parents used to both give me money when i came home...of course, i never let on that the other had already given me money when the second held out the cash........i am becoming a cnn.com junkie.....just want to keep up to date on this baghdad assault.....just want it to be over......

      ok, so i have enjoyed reading the travel diary  that is included on centre's web page.....all about the current london group's travels and antics......well, maybe antics doesn't accurately describe it, but thye lookd to be having a good time.......i got a bit nostalgic with the pics from stonehenge.......it was cold and windy the day we were there, and we had a hard time finding an open restaurant in salisbury.......a bit of trivia...acw bought the tolkein book the Simmarillon (sp) in the gift shop of the salisbury cathedral........the next day we took the chunnel to paris.....i miss traveling....and it is less than 3 months since i got off a plane......

      ok, so i drove over to harrodsburg to buy carryout chinese this evening.......hot and sour soup, spring rolls and shrimp lo mein.....ooooh, ooooh, ooooh.....i just love the stuff.......i have treated myself to chinese a lot lately, mostly because i look at my own cooking so much during the day that i cannot look at it again at night.......i brought home a vegetable lasagna, which is perfectly good to eat......but i could not bring myself to warm it back up.........  i have started the last book club book...a biography of john adams.....this book is a stretch for me.....as it relies heavily on volumes of adams' letters...every other paragraph is a direct quote......it gets hard to pay attention......however, both adams and his wife abigail seem quite interesting as people....both well-read in latin and greek...and in clasical authors like cicero and homer.......abigail's mother opposed their marriage, as she did not see adams as good enough for her daughter.......his father was a farmer whilst abigail's father was a harvard-trained pastor......adams himself went to harvard  at the age of 15, and graduated at 19......a timetable usual for the era.......that is all i know for now.......aside form the obvious...that adams went on to be the 2nd president of the united states, and that he would correspond with jefferson regularly after they both left office, and that they both died on the same day July 4, 1825....adams' last words were....'...jefferson still lives....' how do i know this? i have been to monticello several times, and this story is told each and every tour.........it is interesting trivia......adams also kept a diary.......not quite as interesting as blogging.......many of his entries were short and vague.......Christmas day.1767 ..spent the day thinking.........obviously it was abigail who did all the work, so that adams could do nothing but think.......

      ok, so i took a little drive after the lunch crowd died down....with a load of boxes for kathy clark.......it feels strange to drop off boxes on someone's porch midday, but the day was lovely and it felt really good to get out into the sunshine......jerry is in louisville today, so the computer is idle......just perfect for someone who is playing hooky from work whilst still on the job.......i have been making email hotel requests for next week......and looking up hours of operation for museums......and looking at junk mail........

      ok, so after my class at eku tonight i went to the prayer service at my church.....and who should sit next to me.....cheryl wolfe kerbaugh gibson.....who couldn;t wait to tell me that she had seen scw outside of dhs with a girl on saturday...looking so grown-up and relaxed and consumed...........did i know who the girl was......yes..........they are making a movie......a movie?...........she is one of scw's biggeste fans........and then cheryl started on about the war and her french friends and the sorry state of travel............and i have a note from our sunday school class to her...as she was recently robbed and her father is ill and her mother-in-law is moving and so many problems...but cheryl has been so faithful to me and my problems........i can see her now..bringing supper after my miscarriage......she is such a good person......we were sitting in front of her ex-mother-in-law at thetime/////charlotte'sgrandmother in fact..........only cheryl could handle such things...........she was so gracious......

      ok, so my wayward menfolk have finally called.....they landed last night in eugene, oregon, took a shuttle to florence, on the coast, slept the night at the ocean breeze hotel, walked nearly 2 miles carrying their sadlebags to the bikeshop where they had shipped the tandem.....spent half the day putting it together...rode back 8 miles to the dunes so they could say they started at the ocean...then rode 60 miles back to eugene before they stopped for the night..........they just called....and they are whipped.......and jet-lagged.......and disappointed with the peeps in eugene....many 18-24 year-olds yelled at them from suv's pulling 4-wheelers.......they plan to get up early and ride out of eugene before the young punks get over their hangovers......(their words, not mine.....)...so they started with a 60 mile day.........they promised to call tomorrow with an update..........  finished the extended lotr after i got home from work tonight.....many neat scenes at lothlorian with galadriel.......now i am so tired, and thinking about skipping church....these are dark thoughts......but i really could use a day without having to be anywhere..........

      ok, so mm has invested in the extended cut of lotr.......well worth the extra bucks.......i watched about 45 minutes worth last night......many extra scenes that add to the understanding of the story for those who did not read the book....alas, the extnded cut takes up 2 dvd's not including the dvd's that have cast info, special sesctions. etc.......  in more frightening news. our crazy greeter/cashier, that we hired through a mature worker 'back to work' program quit on friday to take a job......as a prison guard at northpoint........we must be afraid, very afraid about security, as this woman is a nitwhit of the first order........she would forget most aspects of her job from the time she left on friday til she came back on monday.....a flat learning curve.........oh my...on to be a prison guard..........

      ok, so mm slept til 7:30, then breakfasted on a french roll and goat cheese on the deck, with newspaper and coffee............for awhile, until the breeze and the chill got the better of me.......i do not sleep well when ecw is away.....the phone rang sometime after midnight.......i answered, thinking it was ecw checking in from somewhere en route.....but, no, it was someone for acw..............who calls after 10:00, i ask you.........i woke up about 3:00 am freezing, and forced myself to get up and close the window, and find an extra blanket..........i am mustering the incentive (sp?) to get dressed and go to work......i will be working for chef rob tonight, as his son graduates this evening.......scw expressed relief that project secession will wait for his presence.......it may be quite a wait, with his return from the west on june 21, and his departure for belgium june 24.........maybe the exchange-student jon is a secret belgian secession expert of some sort......you just never know.......  mm is just livid over gwbush's stop at auschwitz (sp?) to make a speech reinforcing his decision to go to war......what a piece of work......

      ok, so they are off, with only a few glitches before leaving the house for the airport.....scw wanted to take a hat, for obvious reasons, and ecw was not in the mood to indulge what he calls scw's idiosyncracies...........he forbade scw to take the orange wool cap, so scw snuck the black nike cap into his pocket on the way out the door...........i wish i could have been there when scw put on the hat at take-off..............after letting them off, i free-formed in lex......down the aisles at l.barn, to my fav. goodwills, then back home.........ras we speak, i am making thai hot and sour soup from a mix, with added tofu....i am in the mood.......

      ok, so after 3 calls to angela johnson, messages, rather........because she always called back to the bike shop rather than the restaurant...........i emailed my next issue to the danville school bureacracy.........our exchange student jonathan will be with us during danville's first 2 weeks of school, which means we will need a papal bull to allow him to attend classes with scw...........cynically, i believe that the pope probably grants absolution easier than danville grants exceptions for summer reading testing.........anyway, i have spoken by phone to bob rowland, and have heard back from a. johnson by email, and each had a different story to tell........in fact, a. johnson adressed her email to mr. c-w.......even though the email was sent from kathycw52@hotmail.com.........quite clearly my email........after all of the calls i made to her she has yet to actually call me back......like i am beneath her contempt, i suppose............our poor student may either be a 2 week visitor or an enrolled student, depending on whom you ask........   enough of this danville h.s. stuff.....i have other dirt to dish.........restaurant rumors.........word is that the abc agent, who lives locally, was eating at freddies the other evening.....the owner, denise, approached him without understanding where he works, and commented....' you really must come back on the weekends when we are really hopping...just bring a bottle of wine with you.......'    now, the abc takes this sort of thing seriously, and they have reportedly served her with a warning for breaking the law re: alcohol in a dry county........the law, as stated does not allow for people to drink any alcohol in this county, even in their own homes, let alone in restaurants.........whooops.........

      ok, so the c-w's fought the good fight, and they have conceded defeat........a combined 7 phonecalls/phonemessages and 1 actual school visit was not enough to convince the danville high school bureacracy that it made more sense for scw to take his last 2 summer reading tests this wee, before his bike trip, than to wait until the next and only scheduled test date when he would be in town, june 24, on his way to the airport to belgium........i guess after disqualifiying myra away from sophomore honors english because she was in mexico, they couldn;t do much else.......the whole affair has left a bad taste in my mouth......espcially after the rotary liason, rachel white, told me that boyle schools bend over backwards to make sure that their exchange students have every chance to do the exchange without impacting their school requirements..........and.. rachel added that bob rowland belongs to rotary and should have been more supportive.........

      ok, so memorial day is a made-up holiday, an add-on to all-soul's day specific to war dead.....i do not care about the details...i just needed a day to sit and read on the deck and drink wine and do nothing.......................i have finished the red tent......i did not like the ending, as i knew how it would end..........so bibilical...........but moving as a whole............a curious read for a feminist...so many conflicting issues...............

      ok, so i had planned to sleep in this morning......my sole day off this week, but alas, i was up bright-eyed and reading the paper by 7:15 am........ah well. the lex-herald leader ran the poem bivowac of the dead, along with pics of the iraqi war dead..........i have read the sign by the courthouse, but hadn't truly read the whole thing until this morning....well...i didn't really read all of it........i am not much into war-dead poetry, but it was moving, the parts that i did read.........we had a lively discussion about tatoos in sunday school yesterday......the topic ws on qualifications for deacons, as set forth by paul.........i mentioned that these qualifications were contextual, relating to the culture in paul's time, and that we must consider our culture in determining who is 'qualified' to be a church leader......case-in-point tatoos.........paul never mentioned them directly, only indirectly spoke of dress and demeanor and reputation..........but the discusion led into the question.......would having a tatoo disqualify someone from being a deacon in our church?  right now, at least 5 of my staff have one or more tatoos (most have 5 or more) , which makes me glad that i do not see them in states of undress........but having tatoos says nothing about character......even kathy clark's daughter caitlin has a tatoo, on her foot, of a flower.......anyway, i have no plans to get a tatoo, because they tend to look foolish when a person's skin loses its firmness, a sagging tatoo would be just horrid.........

      ok, so mm is reading the red tent, a novel by anita diamant, whose other books include the new jewish wedding, and choosing a jewish life.......this book is about dinah, sole daughter of jacob, whose 12 sons became the tribes of israel..........i was familiar with the story of jacob, who was forced to mary the elder daughter of laban, leah, before he could marry rachel, his beloved........he ends up also having children with the handmaidens of both leah and rachel.......at the point i laid down the book, jacob had just wrestled with god, and was recovering beside the river.........the wrestling with god thing is a passage we have covered several times in the 15 years that i have taught sunday school.........it was just never covered like this book covers it....pure fiction makes it leap from the page.............the book has been suggested by many of my favorite danville 'readers', and i am just now getting around to it...............quite earthy and evocative.........especially the parts about the wives suckling each others babies..........i know that this was custom, but this is a custom we have gotten so far away from as to shock and cause minor dismay............

      ok, so these lyrics have been in my head all day.....   May God bless and keep you always,  May your wishes all come true,  May you always do for others  And let others do for you.  May you build a ladder to the stars  And climb on every rung,  May you stay forever young,  Forever young, forever young,  May you stay forever young.   May you grow up to be righteous,  May you grow up to be true,  May you always know the truth  And see the lights surrounding you.  May you always be courageous,  Stand upright and be strong,  May you stay forever young,  Forever young, forever young,  May you stay forever young.   May your hands always be busy,  May your feet always be swift,  May you have a strong foundation  When the winds of changes shift.  May your heart always be joyful,  May your song always be sung,  May you stay forever young,  Forever young, forever young,  May you stay forever young.    bob dylan

      ok, so an update on the brunch casseroles is appropriate, because the plot thickened...........not only could the hostess in question not bring herself to make 2 casseroles, she sent her mother to pick them up.......her mother with the broken ankle who had to call us from her cell phone whilst our parking lot to bring them out to her, as she could not manouver in and out of the restaurant with her crutches AND carry the casseroles back to her car.......what kind of woman sends her lamed mother on such an errand?

      ok, so i have been waking up in the middle of the night obsessing about lost books, children finding summer, arranging daycare for cayle while ecw and scw are out waet, getting her to and from swim practice, etc.  obsessing is the key word, because each of these things will work out somehow........

      ok, so mm is really ticked off......trc is a non-smoking facility.......but that does not stop our bridge ladies in the back from lighting up inthe bathrooms, or as they walk through the piano room to smoke outside.......right now we smell like a cig factory.........i cannot abide cig smoke.............quite ironic that many of these proper ladies expressed concern about the high fat content of quiche.......watching cholesterol no doubt.........the cigs will kill them first............

      ok, so we have heard today from someone we hope to meet up with  near yellowstone......and being mother's day she addressed me with kudos......so tragic, in that she is someone unable to conceive..........our minister today focused on that subgroup.......those who are unable to become mothers........i talked today briefly with my child's birth mother, who was unable to parent affectively...........she also has a hard time on mother's day........i have a hard time on moher's day, because i miss my grandmothers...clara stephan broughton and helen kreager crown........both believed in me implicitly..........everyone should have such cheerleaders.......  as it is, i am getting up tomorrow at 4:30, and starting work at 5 to cook breakfast for 13 people who want scrambled eggs an hashbrowns...but they are good customers..........nighty-night.............

      ok, so i called my brother, on mother's day, to check up on him....i assume he has been working nonstop due to the war......but i do not know this directly.......he is moving to somewhere else......also unnamed,...by personal request of someone else unnamed.......and he is delighted...........he asked about my middle child, who he believes would be an excellent prospect to work with all these unnamed entities......i think he is overlooking another great mind in the family, and i tell him so.......so many great minds, so many unnamed entities.........as a liberal democrat i have hard time with all of this secrecy..........in fact, i had a hard time with my sunday school lesson today.......1 and 2 timothy...and the parts about teaching of untruths.....it sounded to me like someone early on questioned paul's teachings..........and this was judged heresy......we had quite a discussion about the current baptist contraversy re;  women in the clergy.......... i personally would leave my church if a consensus came about against women in the clergy......as it is. 43 baptist missionaries have quit after refusing to sign a doctrine against women in the clergy.........so sad that willing workers are excluded because they are women.......uncomprehensible.....of course, i also do not understand baptists thinking that they can convert muslims, jews, hindus, etc..........  i am approaching 22 years of hyphenated bliss......hard to imagine that that much time has elasped.......i can still recall the standoff in the social security office....when the clerk contended that she could not put a hyphen in our name, even though ss # have hyphens........we stood her down and she backed off...........i have no hope that my children will hyphate.....i picked up a history of alexander the great today...his big mistake was in failing to name an heir...no one designated to carry on the dynasty...... i believe that the hyphren thing will end with 2 midwestern liberals........and that our failure to name heirs will be our downfall...............

      ok, so mm is going to disclose the bacon grease story,but just this once.........saturday, we at trc had multiple reservations......in house...for 23 and for 14 and for several groups of 5...for lunch.....and a big group of 52 at constitution square....the carryout group of tandem bicycle riders ordered ky burgoo.....a stew made from chickien, lamb, beef and whatever vegetables........i simmered mine for 3 days..........i had their salads, their cookies and bread, the works in my van when tragedy struck.....my helper, scottie, was carrying a pan on which he had cooked bacon, when he stumbled, and poured the hot grease over my head.....and my arm....i screamed....which didn't phase him as he is deaf......and iced down my arm......but thought nothing of my head..........by the time i had set up the burgoo buffet at constitution square, with sweet tea, pink lemonade, and a vegetarian version of the concoction........it occured to me that scottie had caught more than my arm with the grease......my entire head was coated with bacon grease.......my hair stuck to my head like a helmet....luckily these people were from out-of-town...........

      ok, so i enjoyed reading about the guy in georgia who painted his house lime green with purple polka dots..........the 6-person historical preservation board turned down his request to add a rounded stoop at his front door............so in protest he has repainted his home to really standout in this historically correct neighborhood, which does not happen to have a specfic code re: house paint...........he has announced plans to redo his landscaping around a porcelin(sp) toilet theme......

      ok, so  mm is so very tired.........you have no idea how it feels to be this old.........lots in the news today....the gunman at case western reserve, who shot up the frank gehry building (the one built for $62 million.........) eminem won't let weird al parody his 8-mile song into couch potato, at least on a video.......i guess em has to maintain his serious persona....weird al has been allowed to parady avril...my, i bet that one will be quite special.........the judge has ruled that the disabled girl who sued to be lone validictorian could be so.....even though her disability allowed her to skip gym, study with tutors at home, and otherwise enjoy advantages that able-bodied students were not privy to.......the politicla cartoon in today lexheraldleader is amusing.......an aide is holding the mccarthy hearing transcripts, and says...maybe we should learn a lesson from these.....while john ashcroft standing close scoffs.......mccarthy was an amateur........the southern baptists have kicked out and/or accepted resignations from scores of missionaries.....because they refused to sign an oath stating that women are not fit to be ministers and women must obey their husbands...........this is scary stuff.....the text of my sunday school lesson actually includes references to this issue in 1 and 2 timothy...but the commentary literally does not go there, focuses instead on more positive lessons that can be gleaned from the bible.....as long as there are voices of reason in my own church, i can remain a baptist........a girl who waitressed for us last summer is leaving for the near east next month to be a missionary in a muslim country....she stopped by yesterday....and she was so excited about going that i didn't have the heart to ask her why she thought that trying to convert muslims from their doctrine to her doctrine made any sense.......at least they have a doctrine.....why not try to inspire those who have no spiritual life.......if one must do mission work at all.......  enough of this rant.......my roses are blooming, and the day is lovely, and i am going to pick herbs to put in my omelet before i go to work.........

      ok, so last night after i left, the cook that quit last week came by, trashed/drunk/high......take your pick.......saying something about how they let him out of rehab for the weekend with the requirement that he go around to everyone he has offended to make restitution........the kitchen crew didn't believe him, and they forcefully told him to just leave.........he started arguing that he wasn't drunk...that he was sober......how bizarre..................they should have called the police

      ok, so mean mamma has just had 45 minutes of unprotected......sun......yessserie......i had such a bad day at work that unprotected sun was the only answer, that and 2 glasses of wine on the back deck........for starts, the first burst of rain flooded our side dining room...........which was cleaned up by mr. mudge and the bill sent to our landlord by the time we opened......around 1:15 i decided that business had calmed enough to allow me to get my hair cut....and a heinous cut it is, by the way......on the way back from the bypass the tornado warning was announced........and i made it into trc before the hail started and the siren began wailing.......we have little liability experience with tornado sirens and customers, so i asked each table if they would prefer to move away from the plate glass windows into the cement block portion of the restaurant.........no one would move...they all wanted a window view of the hail and wind and rain..........some even ordered drinks.........back at home, one of my bgiger roses is completely knocked over, and will take quite an effort to lift it up and stabilize it with ropes.....but not today, after 2 glasses of wine........

      ok ,so a new descriptive has emerged in the cw household........whoo-worthy...........which has a slightly mocking tone to it.......gentle readers...be aware that the whoo-thing dates back to the 1st harrypotter movie.....at some point in the action, i reacted in awe with an audible 'whooooo', and my precious middle child has run with that line.........he has added hand and body motions to dramatize the verbal portions.....he claims to be re-inacting the original context but that is not how i remember it.......

      ok, so congrats are in order to the l.o. for her acceptance to centre college, an institution of renown.....but there are lingering questions......as this is a major life milestone....will there be a secession party where secession-appropriate gifts will be bestowed?  as there are no lines of secessionist greeting cards, l.o. could design them herself...and market them to peeps like walmart, and start an empire.......the dissatisfied will no longer quit, they will simply seceed...it has an 'old-is-new-again' feel to it........anyway, given centre's schedule, the lo.o would not have to miss classes to travel this winter, should i, in my meanness, decide to go ahead and book that paris apartment.........

      ok, so there has been a strange shift in the balance of things.......i have spent the week collecting stray rolls of film from drawers,  etc....they all turned out to to be scw's......from the 7th grade trip to france, from spain, and from the bike trip through colorado last summer.....on the france trip rolls there was a picture of charlotte asleep on the train back from chartre......nothing odd there.......but on the bike trip roll, there was a series of pictures of charlotte, charlotte with friends i had never seen (friends from camp?) as well as caroline and jean.......truly bizarre, like a twilight zone moment....like charlotte had somehow taken possession of scw's camera and then snuck it back into his backpack........

      ok, so the news today is filled with bizarre episodes.....such as the church in maine where 1 man has died and 15 other church members are hospitalized after ingesting arsenic in their church committe meeting coffee.......turns out there was no arsenic in the coffee grounds, nor in the cream nor sugar...which means that someone had to have put the arsenic directly into cups, or tainted the cups prior to filling them........further, a man comitted suicide in the same town yesterday, so everybody is wondering whether he 1) belonged to the church 2) somehow did the deed even though he wasn't at the church at the time of the meeting...........this will surely be a fall sitcom.............  the other sad story is about the hiker who was pinned by a boulder somewhere in the desert/wilds of the west.......for 5 days before he amputated his own arm with his pocketknife to free himself.....he is in hospital in serious condition.........i cannot even think about that scnario.........and have no plans to hike in the desert wilds of the west with or without my pocketknife.........  and strangest still is the ongoing saga of the cook who quit abruptly on tuesday.........he had told us all that his wife had left him for a rich guy, who promptly took her off to see the world after the divorce was final, and that she was now in china and had sars.........he also told us that he had converted to judiaism at her request and even told us about his seder menu......well, the dishwasher saw him with this girl monday, in a car, stopped at a light...........who makes up stuff about a wife leaving you and having sars whilst living in china?     this guy struck me as psychotic.....i am glad he doesn't really know where i live.........let's see, if i was goign to make up stories to entertain my coworkers, i believe i would be more creative...............

      ok, so mm is going flying to denver and driving 10 hours into the wilds of wyoming to hook up with the bikers for the last leg of their across america tour.......just have to be there for the finale  in more personal news, ecw and i spent a painful hour with a lawyer yesterday working out wills.......i have had a signed will for many years....but this will did not include a third child.....ecw had no signed will, because the lawyer-friend who prepared mine and his pro bono could not locate his when he came to sign it....and he never got around to coming back, and our friendship with said lawyer has since waned.......you might say that you get what you pay for.........anyway.....it is quite painful to contemplate the actions you wish taken at your death........especially when it comes to belongings.......we have furniture that came over to america from mainz......but do i designate a specific child to caretake this heirloom....oldest child???????, most interested in geneology child?????????/i have this piece because my grandmother put my name on a piece of tape and affixed it to the bottom......i may have to just rely on tape and markers for the distribution of family pieces........there are crown pieces of furniture, stephan furniture, and ernst furniture....oh my........i think the most painful part was deciding who would raise our children.......acw is beyond this...so that leaves a 16 year old and a 10 year old.........this has all been worked out with people we are close to.....but we of course hope that this is never to become public because we will live long enough to see them all reach adulthood.......i will admit to eating crow during this session.......when asked if one of our children should have a spouse and children at the time of our demise, did i want my estate to pass to the spouse should my child predecease me........gentle readers, understand that i have been in a snit for 1 full year because my sainted mother-in-law specifically excluded in-laws as heirs in her will.........inlaws that had put up with her for 20+ years ....and i ended up doing the same thing.........i have an ex-sister-in-law who i despise....and i didn't want to chance that one of my children made a similar error in judgement........we did not put in the will about burial plans....be it known that i want to be cremated, the ultimate in recycling.........and my ashes spread about in the roses.........now, having unloaded great burdens from mymind, i will go back to work...........

      ok, so madame gibson dined at trc at lunch, along with lou cheese, who said she knew me, but whom i swear i have never met........she said she also knew of both my sons from subbing at bate and/or dhs......anyway....it is always a pleasure to see madame gibson.......she requested and received certain email info so she can be supportive of our exchange student......speaking of which, i am trying to arrange 2 sunday/monday trips out of town.....the first to mammoth cave/corvette museum/graceland......the other to wash. dc via southwest through louisville.........the flight is the cheapest, as well as the most direct.......if i could convince aunt roseanne to pick us up at bwi and drop us off at the nearest metro stop, then we could see lots on both sunday and monday before going back monday night.....plus, maybe we could stay with nick and roseanne...and see their roses still in bloom........there is a gem exhibit at the natural history museum that i would like to see, along with the usual stuff like the white house/capital hill/monuments/declaration of independence.... etc....... I am unsure which day jon goes back.........

      ok, so the big news this mornng is katherine hepburn's passing at age 96..........she won 4 oscars....but never had children, possibly because the love of her life was married to someone else the whole time he lived with her......that is so hollywood, i suppose.......i do appreciate hepburn's fashion influence...she wore on and off-screen trouser suits, which caused them to not only catch on but to take on a life of their own.........i liked her best as eleanor of aquaitaine in the lion in winter.....the library has this film...........it is best viewed by people expecting history rather than entertainment...yet hepburn is so entertaining playing a bold and forceful woman trying to beat her manipulative spouse and sons and rival at their own game.........

      ok, so i found this bit from the new yorker from the shouts and murmurs department to be hysterically funny......  SUMMER RECIPES by HENRY ALFORD Issue of 2003-06-30 Posted 2003-06-23 Seasonal cooking is anyway better suited to those who live in sunnier climates. The rest of us need to make the most of what warmth is offered, and much of the time this has to emanate from the kitchen rather than from the skies outside. Summer, then, is an idea, a memory, a hopeful projection.  Nigella Lawson, Forever Summer.         Sun-Dried Tomatoes  8 tomatoes  6 c. olive oil    Unscrew a 100-watt light bulb while it is still gorgeously warm. With a rubbing motion, thrill the skins of the tomatoes until they start to pucker and tumesce. Uncork the oil; drizzle onto tomatoes until lubricious.       Skinny-Dipping at Dusk  8 c. water  25 lbs. cocoa    Store the water in a cool place, allowing it to bio-ripen for a period lasting months or even years. Meanwhile, fill your largest roasting pan with cocoa. Roll in cocoa.       Gone Fishin  1 telephone  1 couch    Unplug the telephone and assume a position on your couch which suggests an odalisque or any late-career Ingres portrait. Should people or problems present themselves, bite into a nougatty chocolate and say teasingly, I cant help you. Im very Ingres-y with you. Let the slipcovers puddle around you like a light vinaigrette.       Summery Chinese Toboggan Salad  1 can bamboo shoots  1/2 c. sesame oil  4 stalks celery, chopped  Juice and zest of 3 lemons  1 wooden toboggan    Put the toboggan in a food processor and pulse for ten seconds on Eviscerate. Remove the splinters from the processor and toss with other ingredients. Arrange on a plate with your bare hands, letting your fingers burrow into the mixture as they do when encountering the rich loam of the earth. Strike your gong.       August Romance  2 c. high-quality vinegar  10 toffee caramels    Unsheath the caramels laughingly, unconcerned of outcome. Fork-prick to soften. Using the soft pads of your thumb and index finger to palpate the caramels, tease them into the vinegar, saying, Mummy knows whats best. Put the whole concoction away someplace dark. Have a glass of Prosecco with a friend, displaying blitheness and a tendency, when food has been dropped on the floor, to plop it back onto your plate with a soulful, sensuous expression.  Can you leave the vinegar alone for between three days and three weeks? Try to, darlingwhat youre doing here is tempering yourself as well as the candy. Enjoy this. Because when you return to the vinegar the caramels will be gone.

      ok, so the new yorker had a frightening short story by stephen king....no idea if it is by THE stephen king.......but it was scarey just the same.....about an aging couple, the husband has a dream and the wife can only look at him in his skivvies, as she listens to his dream,  and wonder if this is all there is to life...........

      Ok,  so the data-line is being used by another c-w, so I am typing on word with the intent to cut and paste.atop my blogging agenda today is the issue of blogging..the herald-leader ran a canned article today on the dangers of tell-all web logging which mainly focused on people who disclosed extremely personal stuff like gender-identity and pregnancy-test results and/or anti-familial religious tendencies on-lineI have had my fill of this sort of thing..my oldest child refuses to read any family blog on general principleeven though his sibling is blogging from belgiumhe sees only the underbelly of bloggingI, on the other hand, can say confidently, that since I have started blogging I have not once felt hopeless or depressedthe catharsis of blogging has a tremendous healing power.just like a written/private diary might have in another age..i discovered on my vacation that writing in a journal with pen and paper is now quite difficult and foreign on to better humours..the new yorker reviewed a set of biographies of Ben Franklinso many tidbits to quote..there are no bad biographies of Franklin for the same reason there are no bad three stooges films. The gist of this article is about how we will ever know what Franklin did or did not doDid he really discover electricity?   Or does it really matter?. The last paragraph is classic..The moral of the kite is not that truth is relative. It is that nothing is self-evident. Scientific truths, like political beliefs, , are guesses and arguments, not certainties. Dr.. Johnsons great, comforting gloss on the Christian funeral service comes to mind:  In the sure and certain hope of a resurrection did not mean that the resurrection was certain, only that the hope was certain. We hold these truths to be self-evident similarly, means that we hold them to be so. We hold these truths as we hold the twine, believing that, without being sure, that the tugs and shocks are what we think they are (referring to electricity felt whilst holding the kite).  We hold the string, and hope for the best.  Often there is no lightening. Sometimes, there is no kite.   It is Friday afternoon, and that statement sounds so-Zen-line for a Friday..  For what it is worth, Princess was here when I got home.

      ok, so last night i made a quick delivery to the danville doyenne, through her back door, of course..........she was ensconced on a chair/ottoman wrapped in a wool, plaid blanket......it was 90 degrees outside but her air cond. was turned down low.....she was listening to both npr and the television at full volume, and she was wearing sunglasses.........her first words to me were ...'where is jerry?'  well, obviously he suckered me into bringing your supper....was what i thought to myself, but i did not say this..........when i amold, i will be doubly cranky and unusual.......if that is possible to be that mean...........

      ok, so we have had a canine crisis.......i made a quick trip home in late afternoon before i was due to do a supper delivery to a local factory.....we rarely do suppers, by the way.........i wanted to check on the pup that grandma left here til tuesday..........i parked outside the gate so she would not get out while i carried my stuff into the house.......the first thing i see is that our dog has made a bed out of the planter with the calladiums and coleus.........he had completely flattened/uprooted them all so that he can squeeze his mangy, good-for-nothing self inside.....while i was dealing with our dog's carnage, princess disappeared...........i saw her for only a fleeting moment and then she was gone.......i looked everywhere inside the fence...nowhere....i checked all the gates...the one under the deck was not locked......she could have gotten out.....so i walked every yard int he neighborhood in 90 degree swamp-like heat....yelling for that dog.....no princess............i went back to our house....looked under every bush and behind every plant.....there was that dog.....behind a rosebush...shaking like a leaf.......hiding from me..........she had seen me yell at oscar about ruining my plants, and she was afraid of mm............so now she is sitting on andrew's lap....chilling out....and trying to figure out who this crazy woman is that yells at dogs..........

      ok, so cayle's first swim meet was last night......i was somewhat surprised by the absense of the williams family...........i was soon brought up to speed......they have joined the country club, and will swim for that team for this summer and all summers to come.........they never struck me as clubbers.......but i suppose the level of competition for that team would be greater than for the dart sharks.........we wish them luck.....  afterwards, i got a wild hair to clean out my 'files'....boxes of stuff in a corner of our bedroom that have threatened to take over.....i threw away a substantial trash bag full of stuff, and reshelved books, restowed stuff that used to be under the loveseat before it was taken away to be recovered, and finally put away the stuff left in the vacation suitcase....and now the bedroom looks nearly picture perfect, with the newly recovered loveseat.........look quick, because my cleaning modes tend to be brief........

      ok, so my alma mater is one game closer to winning a national championship. Ohio State beat Michigan 14-9 in a nail-biter game yesterday afternoon in its signature horseshoe stadium. so sweet.   of course, i did not see the actual ending, as i had to go to work- that is probably why they won- because i wasn't watching. i hadn't watched a game all season (mostly because osu games aren't aired around here......) i musn't jinx the team by watching jan 3- regardless, a national title would be abittersweet memorial for my dad, the ultimate osu fan. i have many fond memories of attending osu games with him- stopping for mcdonalds lunch on the way, which was a treat then- we NEVER stopped for fast food unless we were on vacation or going to a football game.  we would proceed from the parking 'field' to st john's arena where we would listen to the band warm-up- then on to the game.  i remember seeing the osu-michigan game with my dad when woody hayes was still coaching, and the stadium was going to astroturf- after the game (osu won...) the students took down the goalposts and carried them down high street- and the alums took out shovels and trash bags and literally scooped up the playing field as souveniers(sp)...........everybody wanted a little bit of osu turf for their own yards......remarkable.  i did get to see osu beat michigan in ann arbor- when i was in grad school and dating a boy who went to grad school at michigan.....michigan has a bottle law- so after the game- people got out trash bags and started picking up cans and bottles to get back the deposits- it was a remarkable thing to see........

      ok, so i thought this was interesting......plus i still can't figure out how to link..........  Gibson's Jesus film called anti-Semitic Wednesday, June 25, 2003 Posted: 8:57 AM EDT (1257 GMT)  LOS ANGELES, California (Hollywood Reporter) -- Continuing to raise concerns over "The Passion," the Mel Gibson-directed film about the last days of Jesus Christ, the Anti-Defamation League of America (ADL) charged Tuesday that, based on a study of an early version of the screenplay, the project could be "replete with objectionable elements that would promote anti-Semitism."   The ADL embraced the findings of an interfaith committee of scholars that has raised objections to the unreleased film -- even though the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has distanced itself from the same group.   In its statement, the ADL contended that Gibson and his collaborators "must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism. Absent such scholarly and theological understanding, productions such as 'The Passion' could likely falsify history and fuel the animus of those who hate Jews."   "To be certain, neither I nor my film are anti-Semitic," Gibson said in a previously released statement, which his spokesman provided in response to the latest allegation.   "Nor do I hate anybody -- certainly not the Jews," continued Gibson, who is a devout Catholic. "They are my friends and associates, both in my work and social life. Thankfully, treasured friendships forged over decades are not easily shaken by nasty innuendo. Anti-Semitism is not only contrary to my personal beliefs, it is also contrary to the core message of my movie."   Gibson directed "The Passion," which he also co-wrote and produced through his Icon Entertainment banner, in Italy earlier this year. Filmed in Aramaic and Latin, the project stars James Caviezel as Christ and has not yet been shown to potential distributors.   The ADL first began to raise concerns about the film in March, in both a letter to the New York Times and a letter addressed to Gibson that the organization posted on its Web site.   The controversy erupted again earlier this month when a report was leaked to the media that had been prepared by scholars, associated with both the ADL and the USCCB, based on a study of an early version of the script and containing a long list of objections.   The USCCB, however, quickly dissociated itself from the report, with Mark Chopko, general counsel for the USCCB, saying: "We regret the situation has occurred and offer our apologies. ... When the film is released, the USCCB will review it at the time."   In its current statement, the ADL says it "fully stands behind" the scholars' report and raises a series of questions such as, "Will the final version of 'The Passion' continue to portray Jews as bloodthirsty, sadistic and money-hungry enemies of Jesus?"   Myrna Shinbaum, a spokesperson for the ADL, said the group issued its first official public statement on the subject Tuesday in response to repeated press inquiries.   "When these kind of issues are raised and we feel concern, we speak out even before the film has been made," she said, acknowledging that the concerns are based on an early version of the screenplay. "We haven't seen it yet, so we can't speak to the film itself.   "In expressing our concerns," Shinbaum added, "we hope we can have a dialogue with Gibson and Icon to allay the fears of the Jewish community."

      ok, so mm and md are both relieved that our boy made it safely to charleroi/gilly.  it never crossed my mind that he would be traveling into the heart of famous vodka ads....hopefully he will find numerous new ones while is is away.......a group from centre came in for lunch, including some from the admissions/recrutiment office....the comment was made that it was a shame that a certain someone was not going to be coming to centre this fall as a freshman with his good friend, l.o....well, they called her by name, as the speaker is probably unaware of her many pseudonyms.........  anyway, we have had a busy lunch today.......people are still asking if scw and ecw are back from biking..............let's keep up, people..........

      ok, so my guys rode down the salmon river valley yesterday 113 miles, bypassing sun valley and avoiding climbs........scw came up with the route that varried greatly from the one that daddy had originally planned........they had a tailwind, and the 113 miles took less effort than one might think........thus, they are a full day ahead of schedule, which might mean that they will be this side of yellowstone on monday..........alas, the joy of their success was soon dampened by our news that the dock is still in the tree due to the high water and that the boat is still sunk and that the rain continues...........

      ok, so no applause is necessary................mm has gone from being just plain mean, to a bonafide mean genius.........last night fox did a 2-hour special program called testing america. or something like that.....they had a studio audience divided into groups......scientists, teachers, blondes, bodybuilders, students, construction workers, and celebrities........and these folks, along with those of us at home, and those on-line....took a 60 question IQ test.......there were sections on memory, logic, reasoning, math, etc.....with analogies, word meaning, number sequences, addition of strings of numbers, and stuff like which pattern folds up into what shape.......the celebrities were pretty lame.........talk show hosts i had never heard of, an olympic athlete, and yes.....heidi fleiss, the ex-madame turned author.......the computor kept tabs on how each group was doing in relation to other groups........the scientists pretty much kept op top the whole way......in fact, the host randomly picked one to talk to...and he turned out to be a rocket scientist.........he joked that he thought about being a brain surgeon..........anyway...........in the end, they averaged scores from all who particpated on line and in the audience.........and the results were as follows......the state of washington topped the list as smartest state.....boston as smartest big city, chantilly, vs as smartest town overall (averaged 134.......).........men averaged 113, women 111.........one of the scientists had an IQ of 138...the highest in the audience, so they gave him a trophy....no word on who, other than the bodybuilders,  had the lowest.........ok, so mm had a score of 130...........just barely enough for mean mamma to join the mean mensa society............obviously, this test is no measure of sense........scw asked me on the phone last night when fox was going to have the test for 'lick of sense'.........., asserting that i had little of that......now that is in itself a rather mean comment......that's my boy, a chip off the old block..............

      ok, so mm and company here at home have a fresh problem......there has been so much rain in the past 2 days that our rowboat has sunk, and somehow gotten itself under the dock, which is up so high as to be in the sycamore tree............ecw could not believe (on the phone) that acw and i could not manage to undo this situation.......frankly, i do not want to risk life and limb to rescue either the dock or the boat.....as it is, acw gave a valiant effort.........on the other hand, i did manage to repaint the front porch, and redo the upstairs bathroom curtains, and take a wonderful 2 hour nap....all on sunday...........i still have shortlist of home projects i want to complete before i leave for wyming.........  speaking of wyoming, i woke up in the middle of the night with a fresh worry.......our plan for meeting our guys calls for us to drive up through tetons and yellowstone after it probably closes...................when the road will be blocked off.........i may have to book a room in jackson hole for monday night and plan on meeting them on tuesday...........

      ok, so my guys are in idaho......mark one more state off the list.....they are heading toward the sawtooth mountains......  the following article was online this morning...makes me want to go back to barcelona.....  BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- More than 7,000 people gathered at daybreak Sunday and shed their clothes in the morning chill to take part in artist Spencer Tunick's largest work yet -- an installation featuring a sea of nude bodies covering a central Barcelona avenue.   The New York native has achieved worldwide renown for his work, which often features large numbers of nude people posing in urban settings. Though he refers to his art as "temporary site-related installations," he is best known for the photographs he takes of these events.   "I want people to feel uncomfortable that they've demonized the body," Tunick said in an interview with The Associated Press shortly before staging his Barcelona installation. "I want them to feel uncomfortable at first and then realize it's just skin. Yes, the body can be a shape."   He called the Barcelona installation a great visual success. "I created a river of bodies like I've never made before. It was an amazing pink and tan carpet."   At 4 a.m. (0200 GMT) people began arriving at Avenida de la Reina Maria Cristina, a broad thoroughfare lined with fountains. They undressed in a nearby building and were naked for more than an hour as Tunick had them pose four ways: standing, lying down, curled up in balls and hugging each other.   "For me this represents the fragility of the body," said Joan Alexandre Betriu, 53, a participant who called it a "vital, aesthetic and moral" event.   Irene Mohedano, 34, posed with her 5-month old daughter Irene. "This is a work of art," she said. "It may be my only chance to pose for something like this, so I have to take advantage of it."   Tunick said he uses people as raw materials to change perception of space. "I'm using the body as a substance, an abstraction. If the body is nude in front of a background, it creates a new meaning for the background. It makes you think about the background in a different way."   Barcelona joins London, Lisbon, Buenos Aires, Santiago and many other European and South American cities in hosting Tunick.   Sunday's spectacle was his largest yet. Until now his grandest project of this type was an installation involving 4,500 nude people in Melbourne, Australia in 2001.   "In the U.S. they consider the body a crime," said the artist, who has been arrested five times in New York City for working with nudes in public. "In other countries it's celebrated as something special."   Barcelona was particularly accepting of his work, Tunick said, citing praise from Mayor Joan Clos.   Though Tunick insists his work is far removed from commercial nude photography, he recognizes that the fact that he works with nude bodies is a major factor in his success.   "My work is about form, the shape of the body. I'm not creating a provocative photo, I'm saying this is the body you shower with, the body you go to sleep with," he said.   "I've gotten a lot of global recognition because I'm making compelling work that's doing something new with the body. I'm bringing the bodies closer together as substance."

      ok, so mm brought her portable tv to work, and watched the women's final of the french open.........i was pleased to see justine henin-hardenne win, because she beat serena, and because she is so small, and because she hyphenated her name......she dedicated her win to her mother, now deceased, who took her to see the open 11 years ago, and said she thought she could win it some day........quite sweet......i enyoyed listening to justine accept her prize in french.........we have seen serena accept so many time sin english that we often forget that the world does not speak english as the first choice....... the opponent kim clysters, spoke in flemish............

      ok, so they did not call last night.....a fact that i did not realize thoroughly until i woke up with the rain and cold at 3:00 am...........and then i cold not go back to sleep for all of the worry about every worst case scenario........i went to a party after work with the running community.......everybody wanted to know how they are doing.........gentle readers, be aware that most of these folks see my husband as much or more than me when you add up his running and biking time........they miss him as much as i do..........at the party there were people who had not heard about the grapes of wrath testing debacle, and ecw's refusal tolet scw take along the 2 full-size books in the bike bags, and the buying of the cliff notes.......one friend looked incredulous that we had failed to simply download both books on our palmpilot.........and then even more incredulous that we have no palm pilot..............having the internet is a big step for the c-w's....lets not be too hasty about technology.........

      ok, so this bit fo news was on cnn.com this morning......doesn't it make you proud to be an american?  LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- Talk about what you can do for your country!   In an unusual act of patriotism, a Nevada brothel is offering free sex to troops returning from the U.S.-Iraq war.   The Moonlite BunnyRanch in Nevada, a legal brothel, also plans to extend 50 percent discounts to the military for the next few weeks, proprietor Dennis Hof told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday.   Hof hit on his unique gesture for honoring U.S. troops when BunnyRanch star and former Playboy magazine centerfold Sunset Thomas was flooded with letters from the front lines.   "We were receiving about 20 letters a day," Hof said. "We thought, when these guys are done we'll do something special for them."   Thirteen men and three women in uniform have shown up so far to claim their gifts. All told, the free and discounted sex will cost Hof about $50,000 -- a worthy sacrifice, he said.   "We want to feel patriotic and feel we are doing something for our servicemen," he said. "If we owned a Dairy Queen we would be giving away free ice cream, but ... we own the sex capital of the world. What better way is there to give back?"

      ok, so my guys rode in to sisters, oregon a little ahead of schedule, and opted to ride on to redmond (sp)...for an 80 or so mile day.....they are making good time, which should give them some leeway in case of bad weather.........food was their main issue today......there were no restaurants/gas stations/groceries for the first large chunk of their ride, so they were forced to survive on powerbars and water for  much of the day......

      ok, so let the madness begin......scw received his first bit of bizarrely addressed mail today...to stephan crow-web..........like the computer couldn't handle either end of the hyphenated name, yet retained the hyphen........we in the c-w family are well-versed in hyphenated-maladies.............we go to pick up film ,and are told that no film exists...so we must remind the clerk that c-w begins with a C.......not a W.........and..lo, the film is found and all is well..............there are times, when callers ask for mrs. weber,....or worse, mrs. webb.....that i briefly wish i had a name like smith......but even that name can be smith or smythe...so there......but even crown should have been an easy name...one syllable...........so why not keep the n...why does it end up as crow..............counting crows,...black crows.........such a shame that a name gets such little respect..........

      ok, so today we catered a funeral wake........which turned into a lot of fun after the family left and the funeral director stuck around to help finish off the buffet.....seems that the family, who ironically insisted on a lavish spread, balked at the cost of an urn........and showed up at the funeral home with a teapot from the deceased's china cabinet...........the funeral director could only fit half of the ashes in the teapot, and told the fiuneral director  to dispose of what did not fit........so friends of the deceased turned up with yet another teapot (one that the deceased had admired) , and presumably the deceased is now literally...in two places at once.........as the friends are not sharing their half of the ashes with the family...........whooooo.......one of the daughters of the deceased alledgedly accused one of the friends of stealing the deceased's mink coat, which is laughable, as the friends outweighed the deceased by at least 100 pounds and could not have fit her arm in the coat........so the friends did not come to the lavish wake at our resaurant, and are instead, mourning in private.......and then there is the story the funeral director told about the booking of our restaurant in the first place.......one of the daughter-in-law's had called us, at the suggestion of the mother of the deceased.....and ordered an extensive array of food......then the church holding the memorial let it be known that they had already taken care of booking a buffet at another downtown caterer's dining room......so a daughter called back to cancel......until she saw the room....... then she called us back to reinstate the previous buffet order.....ouch........the mother of the deceased left several large flower arrangements in our lobby....asking us to make use of them somehow........while we were talking to the funeral director, a latecomer breezed in the lobby, grabbed up one of the arrangements, then walked back out.....it was quite bizarre........and then there is the story the friends tell about the mother of the deceased, who, within hours of the actual death, was seen in the deceased's yard attempting to pull down her wrought iron fencing.......'because she would have wanted me to have it'  the mother said when questioned about the taking of the fence.......she ended up calling in workman to do the deed....... presumably before the deceased's children arrived in town...........posession IS 95% of the law, is it not?

      ok, so my guys rode about 80 miles yesterday, along the mckenzie river. they phoned last night from a phone booth in front of their 'log cabin', part of a rustic 'motel'.....you used to see those places, with clusters of tiny cabins that didn't look big enough to have bathrooms.....i forgot to ask if my assumption was correct.......today they ride over mckenzie pass, their first big climb.......they have to take an alternative route that is longer but with a gentler rise is elevation....as their original choice is snowed in.......they seem in good spirits.........scw was most concerned that i remember to water his bonzai...............

      ok, so mm will come clean with the sanitized gossip........last night, at a graduation dinner for an unnamed dhs senior, mm was hugged more than once by someone she believes now to have had her breasts 'done' ......mm has never before been so certain of something so unexpected as this.........and she is further convinced thatr it is pure stupidity for women to have their breasts 'done' if they feel like that in a hugging situation.........further irony......mm plans to have her breasts 'reduced' whenever her ship comes in.......why women desire bigger breasts is beyond me......fir at least 1 week a  month, you cannot sleep comfortably on your stomach..........blouses gap annoyingly.......why would anyone in their right mind desire this misery?   clearly, this woman did.......i hope they will not burst on her any time soon........

      ok, so we have clear signs of the coming of the apocalypse.......mm has spent the morning cleaning........not just picking up...i mean the cleaning the baseboards beneath the supper table and scrubbing out the showers kind of cleaning.........i am soaking the little pans that go under the stove burners as we speak.......because i was born without a cleaning gene, this behavior is frightening, even as i discover that the tub and tile spray removes the water stains on the dish drainer.............maybe this is just guilt from having skipped church................regardless, i am on my 3rd load of wash and will soon begin to recover the deck-table bench cushions...........

      ok, so mm is bursting at the seams and it is not her weight......we have new 'neighbors' on gwinn island circle.......and we do not expect these folks to be moving in soon.........we suspect that they bought the house as a weekend place, and as a mail box in the boyle district.........now, i say this as someone who has grandfathered her children into the danville system from the boyle system..........regardless of the insanity we went through with ap english reading tests.....i still could never see my children attending the legal district for our address..........my children are not, and never could be...boyle children..........i have said more, but i have wisely erased it all............back to the white-flight mail drop.........i am so out of the loop i did not know that they no longer attended danville schools...the younger ones go to the christian school......and the older one goes to boyle, in his cowboy boots.......i should have them to dinner.........  on a completley different topic, i am scheming about financing a trip to paris,and an apartment.........maybe i should get up a website.....send this poor lowly working mean mamma to paris.........

      ok, so this morning i forgot all about my vacation rant and rave........i suppose i ranted and raved so much whilst actually driving that it was almost.......out of my system.....at the mammoth caves exit....in cave city, ky........amongst the deserted 'attractions' was a christian theme park.......golgotha fun park, to be exact......up on the hill.......all i saw driving toward the national park was the sign........golgotha fun park.........so i had a 12 mile window of opportuity to rant about how there was nothing fun about golgotha (the sign of the scull where jesus was crucified....) and what would possess people to think that anybody driving another 12 miles to or from mammoth caves would stop and spend money at this 'attraction' .........on the way back, we noticed right away that the gates were padlocked........which meant that we were right, no one wanted to bring their children to a theme park centered around the death of christ........and so it folded.........from the brief glance we got, a few painted statues of madonna and of christ were visible...the concrete kind that are sold at such places that sell concrete planters..........my gut instinct is that the church family of whoever developed this crazy thing did not even bother to come...................

      ok, so we are back from our first excursion, and i am blurry-eyed exhausted.........the drive back from memphis took about 7.5 hours, when one factors in the road construction slowdowns, the rain, the pit stops.........we saw a part of mammoth caves that i had never seen before.....one that was accessible only from 500 nearly vertical steps designed by an engineer specializing in building submarines....i don't like heights. so this required a bit of lamaze breathing..........the tour guide/ranger was perky and knowledgable......the formations(drapery, stalactites, stalagmites) were really neat.......the best tour memory?.....the woman who clutched her cell phone during the tour.......like she had to be ready to take a call...in a cave 250 below the surface of the earth......can you hear me now?............then on to memphis........graceland (this morning) was already crowded ay 9:30 am.....the price of admission includes an audio tour, so they are able to crowd many more people through the house quickly.......i could not get over the notion that my entrance fee pays for lisa marie's lifestyle, including her bizarre marriages and singing career.........anyway, graceland was a funky diversion, especially the jungle room.......the best memory?.......the large group of people from ohio wearing matching t-shirts......

      ok, so i managed to enjoy a date with my husband at our wine tasting last night, while my partner and his partner escorted scw and student belgian exchange student at the belgian architect's house.....we tasted 12 different wines...6 whites and 6 reds.......i do not care for reds all that much, and dumped most of each small garnet glass rather than swallow it down.........the appetizers turned out quite well....we may add some to our bar menu.......so here i am on sunday morning trying to rally, pack a small bag, load the kids into the car, and go to mammath caves.....i am so tired, however, and the urge to just stay home is overwhelming........ecw continued to coach me on the nuances of his cabriolet right up until he left to go riding this morning.....his convertable gets better mileage, and has the advantage of being a convertable........every belgian should see part of america from a convertable.......i hope to get to our memphis hotel in time to see olntv's coverage of the tour's last day......i have no idea if our hotel gets olntv.......one can only hope that the baymont hotel airport has monster cable..........

      ok, so mm is up and sipping hazelnut coffee, despite the 2:45 am bedtime..........the past 24 hours have been more than a blur........my mother and i arrived at the cincy/northky airport in time to meet jon, the belgian boy at the delta luggage claim. we had his picture, and thought it would be no problem to pick him out of the crowd...........he has lost weight since that picture was taken....or rather...he appears to have lost muscle since he is not in gymnastics season.......anyway, the realtime jon looked  much smaller than i expected.......he whipped out his english phrase book within 5 minutes of meeting me....i must remember to speak more slowly and to use fewer slang terms.......anyway...with 5 hours to kill, we got back in the car and headed toward mecca......the joseph-beth store in norwood (less than 1 mile from where ecw grew up, and our first apartment).....we had dinner in the cafe before browsing.....and emerged from our meal to find that it was a booksigning evening.......david eggers who wrote the book' you(they?) will know us by our velocity' he sounded quite interesting.....he was reading aloud from one of his books........but they must have stockpiled all of his books near the signing table as i could not find any away from the crowd.......we made out way through tjmaxx, steinmart, homegoods, and other stores until they closed at 9:00, then went back to the airport, where we sat and watched cnn until scw emerged, looking taller, more european, and much older than when he left.........we could not leave just then, as a girl from lexington who had been on most of scw's flights appeared to have been forgotten......her parents had not shown up.......we waited with her, then started asking for them to be paged, then finally sent her and scw off to search other terminals (they arrived on united...) in case the parents thought she was on delta........bingo, her mother had been in another terminal, waiting and worrying.......we finally left for home at midnight.......there is something surreal about driving late at night, with all of the truckers.........trying to stay awake......we listened first to allison kraus, then to wilco's newest album........several tracks reminded me of dark side of the moon, especially against a night sky and a van full of sleepy passengers.......we will surely here snips and snatches of the belgian experience over the coming days and months.......though there is less to tell given the day-by-day commentary we were blessed to read thanks to blogging......less to explain.........i feel much more prepared to be a host given all that i have read about the gillard family and how they dealt with a 4-week houseguest.......still, it will be a challenge.........and then there is my baby boy...back home again......praises be....

      ok, so i want it noted on my permanent record that many of the numerous emails sent to a certain student staying in belgium were forwarded news articles of interest rather than actual word-for-word written notes sent electronically........well, yea, i did write a lot of notes, because it is so easy to dash off a few lines to a loved one and press 'send'........these days writing an actual note and affixing a stamp seems to require an entire time slot in my day (this does not even include the time it takes to select the perfect note card........), whereas sending an email seems to take only a few minutes.  of course, the lack of permanence is a shortfall.........i hold dear a letter that my grandmother crown sent to me while i was in college.......it wasn't very long, but she took the time to write it and send it, and now i have a record of her handwriting, her word choices, and the bits of news she chose to share with me in 1975......emails come and go, with little reason to use valuable storage space in their keeping.......unlike blogs, by the way, which can be archived and downloaded......if one could find the time.........when this student goes to college, i must make an effort to write actual notes on occassion, just in case he is feeling sentimental and wants to keep a little written record of my voluminous (sp) correspondence........

      ok, so in a fit of boredom i set off in search of new reading material in my own home.........i have reread all of the harry potter series this summer since reading the new one, so that i could reread it fully reminded of all that had transpired prior.......i reread all of jane austen last summer........all of agatha christie on previous summers.....all of colette more than once...........i have read most of our list for book club...and those that i have not read i do not yet own........soooooooo, i ventured into the room of our only absent child to see what splendors lurked on his shelves........i selected running with scissors, a memoir likened to the style of david sedaris....supposedly this is a true story of this person's childhood....even looking at the picture on the back, i am unclear whether it was written by a man or a woman, as there is great gender conflict..... and serious wit......and, i am certain......some gaps in memory versus made-up memories........for example.....he/she is recalling an instance when the crazy poetess mother is getting ready for a poetry reading...she is wearing pucci and high heals....and feels like there is 'something missing'......she reaches for her box of feminine supplies and takes 2 pads, peels off the backs...and makes her own shoulder pads........now......this instance was supposedly late 60's/early 70's.........30 years ago at least........if my memory serves me, peel-off sticky technology did not come along until much later........wonder if there is a peel-off sticky sort of web site to prove or disprove this memory........ of course, i may be just being mean about this tale, which strikes me as both contrived and over-the-top to be as true as purported........i will just put the book back, and wait for comments from the book's owner..........

      ok, so i am personally relieved that my boy abroad has made contact...after his last blog we became quite concerned about his safety.......and somewhat amused about what our guest will think about our family......there are times when most of us has(have?) a book in hand.....not often 100%, but at least 2 or 3 out of 5 at any given stretch of free time......people unfamiliar with the concept of a leisure-reading family culture could see it as strange, i suppose.....or quite boring...certainly nothing to be suspicious about.......well, yeh, we do spend far too much money on books, but that is a discussion that i will not begin to get into at this time.........

      ok, so it turns out the little boy sexually assaulted at the bcfair last sunday not only goes to my church...his mother is in my sunday school class........she was still emotionally distraught this morning, but felt compelled to tell of the experience to warn parents that pedophiles are in danville and we must warn our children about them.....as well as how they can avoid these dreadful encounters.....last sunday after church, this mother and her 2 boys (both under 7) were setting up her booth at the fairgrounds.....only 3 trailers were yet there at that time...they were playing on the swings and the teeter-totter...within clear sight of the mother.....with no one else in the play area......the older boy fell off the teeter-totter......and immediately a man got out of his car and rushed over........he not only checked out that nothing was broken, he pulled down the boys pants 'to check for damage'.......and it went on from there until the boy said 'stop...i want you to stop'.......by the time the mother noticed the boy on the ground, the man was walking back to his car.....my friend noticed that he was a pleasant, good-looking man.....but at the time she had no idea what had just happened.......of course, by the time the police had arrived, the man was gone.....the mother was able to give a description, and the police artist was called in........that same day, another boy was assaulted in the mercer public library, so poliuce believe that the man just moved on to another place where he might find unwitting children.........these sort of things scare me terribly, as a mother of a 10 year old girl with little sense of personal safety.....the very first time i met her was at brookcove gas station, when she asked me....a complete stranger...to buy her a candy bar........the list in the paper, for parents to read to their children with hints for avoiding dangerous encounters covers the buying of treats by strangers, as well as other ploys used by sexual predators to entangle little ones for evil deeds..........i was reminded of 2 instances in my past.......one when i was maybe kindergarten age......my two older male neighbors  (both surely under age 10)paid me 10 cents to let them look under my shirt.......i do not remember telling my mother, because i had the dime and i was afraid i would have to give it back.......the other incident happened much later, when we lived in mt gilead, and i was maybe a freshman in high school.....our cousins, aunt and uncle from texas had stopped by for lunch, and my brother and i were in the basement with the cousins playing pool, and somehow, the older cousin grabbed me by my chest from behind, and then tried to kiss me..........i was horrified, and cried and ran upstairs, but did not tell my parents what happened until the cousins had left........i was so ashamed........i have no idea if my parents ever said anything about it to them or to other family members....these were my mother's least favorite in-laws.....but it is safe to say that they never came back.........i want to tell this mother that her child will be ok, especially if she does not dwell on this as pivitol......keeps bringing it up.......if she drops it, he will soon drop it from his memory bank...file it away...until a much later date........it will be an unpleasant memory.....but it will not ruin his life..........

      ok, so the elements of an idyllic sunday morning are as follows..........an indefinite period of lounging under the covers semi-sleeping to the npr's sound and spirit.........a nice not-too-strong cup of coffee on the back deck with both newspapers.....with mist rising from the creek and the sound of scw's fish pond bubbling softly in the backround........sitting at the french-style cafe table and chair.....which has a perfectly matched tablecloth and seat pad.....(yeh,yeh,yeh....this so martha..but this its MY idyl and i'll match if i want to........)....no one has turned on the television.......birds break into song from the limb of the tree with the owl-hole.........yep, this just about sums it up..........

      ok, so i have read my boy's latest blog, and i am distressed because he seems distressed with dealing with emotional and eratic strangers...........my french is so poor, that i would only have it on this woman's body language that she was so upset, and i don't know what i could have done to calm her down.......i do so hope that i do not lose it completely in front of this poor belgian lad.........i may take to hiding his shoes....you just never know when it comes to the meanness i am capable of........

      ok, so maybe i, too, have adult attention deficit disorder......i am frequently distracted, fidgetey and impatient when i must wait, and have a difficult time finishing tasks..........like finishing putting up the last 6 feet of wallpaper border in the upstairs bathroom.......or getting around to putting the mulch around the bush by scw's fish pond..........or putting 4 years of photos in albums..........yea.......none of these failures are my fault...it is organically impossible for me without proper medication........i new there had to be a reason.........

      ok, so i was clearing tables today at trc, when i noticed that someone left a LEAFLET under their plate.........now, come on.......this is america, the land of free speech, but this leaflet is crazy....with sections about 'are you sure that there is heaven?'   what point could they possibly want to make by dealing  'is there heaven?' as their first card?  if there is no heaven, then why bother with the rest of the leaflet.........i do they really think that they will 'convert' people based on disrupting faith in the hereafter?  and if there is a heaven, how can they be so sure how to get there?  ........   on a different note, i was coming home from work, and found a suburban from texas in my driveway.....a traveling book/educaitonal software salesman......well, i was not even kindly in telling him that i was not interested and to get his vehicle out of my driveway..........'educational books/software are useful only to those who will use them....and in this family those who will use them already have hundreds of books in their personal collections, and those who don't use them also have hundreds of books in their personal collections.....so no need to buy more at this time.........the weight of our collective books will cause us to slide into the lake at some point'...........this man looked both stricken and afraid...........and he left..........

      ok, so we are in the stephan-coming-home countdown.......less than a week........the logistics of meeting scw and jon at the airport will be interesting......we have accessed the airport website to try to pick out a meeting place for us and jon, as he will arrive hours before scw........we are also tidying up the upstairs spare bedroom so that scw can have personal space again........this means that i will have to make a curtain for the window.....it has had fabric just draped over the rod for at least a year (when acw went to college and the bedroom swaps began in earnest.....) the old curtain didn't go with the new william morris-style wallpaper, so i took it down.......the closet of this room is filled with bolts of fabric (this room was intended to be my sewing room....) but they will just have to stay there.........

      ok, so this morning was my last 5:30 am wakeup call for a few days....breakfast catering jobs are overrated...when i arrived at trc at 5:45 am......a marauding band of young punks on bikes (approx age...10 to 15) came roaring around our corner from walnut street....and then through the papa john's lot onto main street...my first thought was 'why are they up so early'....followed by my second thought..'have they even gone to bed yet...?'

      ok, so  my book club picked its selections for next year tonight......the balloting took three votes..... oh my.......my 1st choice...the secret life of bees made it in.....as did to kill a mockingbird, the sun also rises, the quiet american, absalom,absalom......and a thriller whose name escapes me.....i am fixing dinner for the secret life of bees.......so many choices on what to prepare......and i would have preferred the sun also rises, even though i did not choose the book...i really like this book........

      ok, so i have gotten up at 5:30 the last 2 days to go into work to get a catered breakfast together.....i am back home by 7:00.......today i took advantage of the early hour by taking a walk around the circle as an act of piety prior to the newspaper and a cup of cafe creme........curious, the things one notices when sleep deprived........  -the blue rental house appears to be empty -the neighbors who are expecting their second baby appear to have traded in their monster truck for an suv -there was a pile of green rubber bands at the circle's stop sign.......maybe tossed from the window of the    paper person? -the next door neighbor has at least 24 tomato plants in wire cages in his front yard (circle people have no    back yards...the lake IS the back yard...) none of the tomatoes are yet red..... -the new neighbors get up early to sit on their front porch and smoke, along with a cold canned beverage......   the pop of a top is unmistakable..... -there are numerous weeds between the bushes in front of MY fence.........maybe i should go right on out    there and take care of them...... -i really like the smell of my boxwoods and rose bushes on misty mornings.....the eglantine rose bush smells   like green apples......marvelous

      ok, so i really enjoyed this cnn.com piece.......  SAN FRANCISCO, California (AP) -- A high school teacher, fed up with the Bush administration's playing cards featuring Saddam Hussein, "Chemical Ali" and other most-wanted Iraqis, is now selling her own deck, "Operation: Hidden Agenda."   Kathy Eder's 55 cards show pictures of the president, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others along with quotes, mostly from journalists, questioning the rationale for the U.S.-led war. The backs of the cards feature a 1983 photograph of Rumsfeld shaking Hussein's hand.   Eder, 42, said she decided to create her own plastic-coated propaganda in March as a comeback to the "messages of hate" contained in the cards the Department of Defense issued to help U.S. troops identify suspected war criminals.   The $9.95 deck of cards are being made by Texas-based Liberty Playing Cards, one of the companies that prints the government's "Most Wanted" cards.   Once the product became available online and at a few bookstores, Eder said she sold 3,000 decks in three weeks. She's already placed a second order for 5,000 decks.   Eder has pledged to donate half her profits to five nonprofit organizations that promote nonviolence and provide aide to Gulf War veterans and Iraqis.    the best part....both decks are printed in texas........

      ok, so my mother taped yesterday's tour, on the back end of the cbs tour broadcast from sunday...........and the tape ran out just after the crash.............ecw was distressed, obviously......to be unable to see the rest of the race, and unable to hear lance's interviews about his luck in avoiding injury.........maybe tonight's broadcast will include a replay of yesterday's big moments........

      ok, so it IS all abut the bikes.........i check scw's blog daily, then i check on the tdefrance results........even though i will sit and watch the tape on oln courtesy of my mother..........knowing and watching are two different things....and today i know about a crash that lance eluded.......and must keep quiet about until we watch it this evening......i did see on-lne where a person can pay $2500 for a week of riding the our course either before or after the tour has been there....and see the stages for that week from a vantage point.........this is precisely the event that would get my spouse to travel to france again.........

      ok, so ky's historian laureate turned 100 years old today.....dr. clark is currently working on a book about the governor's mansion......quite fitting that a historian lives to be 100, or older.........i am starting to know all about old.....by the way.........or rather, ancient......last night we went walking, and we starting talking about the new playset in a neighbor's yard, which is right about where the original owners had their playset 21 years ago.........21 years isn't that long......i suppose, compared to 100.......the good news is that i am not quite ready for the rocking chair.........

      ok, so a little lady came for lunch today with a bunch of other blue-haired little ladies......and she exclaimed......why kathy crown..i remember when you got married..........i just smiled and said......yes, that was a long time ago........what i didn't say was that this lady was not there.....and that the wedding had not been in our church here in danville as this lady proceeded to tell others at her table.......my wedding was not even in ky........but it was not worth interupting the curious story that this adled lady was telling her table.........i wonder if there was a tornado at my presumed danville wedding?

      ok, so it is saturday.......a day that i no longer have off on a regular basis.........so hard to get out of bed on saturdays.........that desire to sleep in is ingrained.......but so is my desire for a cup of coffee and the newspaper, so i drag myself out of the bed and into my morning routine.......which now includes reading a certain foreign-published blog, email, and the tour de france news.......sometimes i even have enough time to read for awhile in an actual book....not today..the two books that i selected yesterday at the library seem pretty insipid.......and i hate to waste my tme finishing pointless fiction.........

      ok, so the book that i really liked from the library was by trisha ashley.....who has written 3 books, 2 of which are not available at the library, at bn.com or amazon.com or half.com........the name trisha, i find interesting, as a neighbor in millersburg was named trisha dando....i could do flips off of her swingset, and  her brother was retarded, and she had purple glass ballerinas in her room.......i really wanted to have a room decorated with ballerinas..........i lacked the nerve to do front flips off anybody else's swingset after we moved............a critical moment lost........

      ok, so cayle and i sped down to the dock after work to swim.....and there were people there.....not ON our dock....but about 10 foot from it.....on a pontoon......with at least 6 children of ill-temper.....we could clearly hear the whining as we approached......there were 2 maternal- appearing women...and a husband-like unit boated  up in a skiff not long after..........they all seemed taken aback that anyone lived here, despite the dock, and our quite visible grey deck amongst the foliage........i know that we live in paradise.......but i am unprepared for strange women to 'gun it' when they see us coming.....these 2 women gunned their motor like cayle and i were convicted felons on the loose.........they were drinking coke products, by the way.......pepsi peopl would have acted more civilised..........

      ok, so i have to admit that i find a certain joy in bush's current situation with regard to iraq.......yes, i do not wish ill on my countrymen who are being sniped daily......but i do find joy in the fact that bush may be caught red-handed in lying to the american people about the womd/uranium/terrorist threat in iraq that he used to start the war in the first place..........yes, and sars is now in texas.....now isn';t that interesting.....

      ok, so i have enjoyed a few library books of late......one is very strange...the new one by tom robbins.......a curious writer whose book even cowgirls get the blues was quite erotic and profound and memorable...........this one is based on the premise that some mias from viet nam went missing out of choice, and that they are still in southeast asia doing whatever they please.......the other book is about a woman who defines herself after her controlling husband asks for a divorce......i did like this novel....though i could not empathize with someone who dressed like a goth just because her husband wanted her to do so.......but i liked the writer's style enough to want to know if she has written any other books in a similar tone......good books sometimes are the best parts of my day.........

      ok, so mm watched tv in a certain exchange student's basement bedroom last night, because the tour de france tape was far from completion upstairs, and we only have 2 tv's on premise,  and keen eddie was on realtime broadcast........i really like that show, enough to bear (?bare) the wrath of the hatted one, who does not like people in his room........keen eddie is a hoot for bond fans, as many of three actors in the last 3 or so bond movies are regulars on this show.......  yesterday, cyle and i went swimming for the 1st time since the boat has been extracted from the deep.....the water was wonderful......not quite bathwater temp...but fine just the same......not much chance of a tan/skin cancer at 5:00 and after.........event was marred by the failure of time magazine to show up (it was a tuesday........) these are idylic conditions, you must understand....a nice swim, time magazine and a beer in the beach chair on the dock.........maybe time will arrive today.........

      ok, so i am saddened at the news that the cojoined twins in singapore died after their separation operation........the operation was risky...no doubt.......but the need for us all to have personal space would be quite a draw for taking the risk.....i do not think i could survive sanely with someone strapped to my head 24/7...especially if she is my blood kin........  yesterday i had a few moments between finishing up lunch and catering 2 suppers, so i drove on out to the goodwill to see what treasures awaited.......they had french-style bistro chairs for $7.50..still in the boxes.....you know...the green ones that fold and sit ever so quaintly below an outdoor table.......the rungs are resin rather than wood......but that is actually a draw, since i intend to put them outside.....2 by scw's new fishpond and two up by the mulberry tree.......i like it when cute is reasonably priced..........i also bought cayle a dress at peebles.......marked down from $45 to $18........bargains really make my day.......i bought a size 14 because she has grown so tall of late.....and because she is filling out of late.........she may be getting to the point where she can ride up front despite the airbag........

      ok, so a veil of secrecy has settled on our household...........it is tour de france time.......my mother tapes each night's broadcast on oln, then ecw picks it up next day and we watch it before bed, with a beer...the secrecy comes in on the side of pre-knowledge......i read about every day's results online before leaving work.....and i cannot tell ecw because he does not want to know...he wants to watch........so...right now  i know that tyler hamilton wrecked and fractured his collarbone........and is disappointed that he has worked so hard for this year's tour........but wait......he rode a fabulous time today despite the injury................i will know this when we watch yesterday's race tonight...but i will not be able to tell it........this secrecy thing is not in my genetic makeup..........  speaking of secrecy/restraint......today i checked out a few books (we are so slow at trc in july...)  and someone who works there was telling me about her daughter who is struggling to finish the last of her ap books before leaving on vacation...blah...blah......and how she will have to take a test on the day they leave before they can actually leave .....i smiled and said nothing..........this is BIG......i did not feel that i needed to tell of the entire ap reading and testing thing before scw's trips.....i just smiled......surely God has this on her permanent record.....................

      ok, so i negelcted to mention that my brother-in-law who hosted this gettogether not only had karioke set up in hte basement, the system wasn't even rented........ironically, his ex-wife and her new husband (attending for the sake of their daughter/guest of honor who recently got married) were obviously well-practiced in karioke...........my table of in-laws pronounced that none of us were drunk enough to get up and sing..........(true, as i am no fan of white zinfandel nor of bud light...........)one in-law laughingly said that maybe when she retires she will sing karioke out in her garden to try to scare away the deer who eat her rose bushes........we told her that she could amend her adt (security?) sign to read......this home guarded by adt and karioke.........i guess you had to be there......  speaking of all of my in-laws......ecw and i, as well as his little sister and her husband.....were the only attendees not discussing retirement dates.......his siblings are either in their 60's, or teachers who can reitre before 60, or professionally unemployed (don't ask.....) one sibling plans to be a walmart greeter when his wife retires in 2 years.....at this rate, when ecw and i retire, that whole crew may well be in longterm care homes..........

      ok, so we have just returned from a quick trip to a weber family gathering at my brother-in-law's summer/retirement home in tenn......a few observations from the trip down, the experience there, and the trip back.....when we were stuck in a traffic jam for 45 minutes between london and mt vernon due to an accident......  1. ohio is celebrating both it's bicentennial (1803-2003) and the anniversary of the wright brother's flight ...... 2. indiana's web page is located at www.IN.gov..........both of these facts were gleaned from liscense plates.... 3. the voyager has very little back storage space.........those wild children ahead of us for 10 miles at close range seemed to be right on the back window...... 4. the new ky liscense plate with the smiley face sun is quite lame...... 5.the black jetta is one of my favorite cars for looks on the highway......... 6. too many people own and travel with three-wheeler vehicles pulled on trailers......... 7. almost all motorcyclists have visible tatoos...... 8. the pine mountain area of ky is lovely....when you overlook the flea markets, the mobile homes, and the litter....... 9. my nephew mitch is a genious...he remembered me from last november and he is not yet 3......... 10. i really like my sister-in-law roseanne......... 11. i am really glad that my brother-in-law nick retired from the fda 2 days ago........he needs to enjoy like due to his brain tumor........... 12. i have never watched more james bond movies in a single 36 hour time frame than this weekend........my in-laws have the entire catalog on dvd........... 13. i do not like greasy-granny wedding cake........

      ok, so mdaddy was kind enough to weedwack the brick walk yesterday, and water the hard to reach places while i was at work...the walk was looking like a weedwalk, a bushier and far less attractive alternative to a thymewalk.........i have been watering faithfully every morning, as i am determined that the garden will still look good when our guest arrives..........many plants are beyond hope or beyond their bloom cycle, but phlox remain and a few other perennials.....and maybe the trellis roses will rebloom if they get enough water........we travel after work today to morristown, tenn, where ecw's next oldest brother has a hiltop home....all of ecw's siblings will be there........it should be interesting.....or amusing, which ever comes first is good enough for me.......  last night our neighbors set off numerous large fireworks.....they must have cost a bundle as they were sizable and impreessive and could not have been legal in this state........i  have heard tales of trips to tenn for illegal fireworks.....i don't undertsand the desire for explosive pyromania.........i saw the first one, then decided i needed a hot bath more thna i needed pyrotechnics.........another 4th come and gone.......speaking of patriotic things.....i heard on npr yesterday that igor stravinsky was once arrested after a performance in boston because his orchestration of the star spangled banner changed the phrasing.....and the ploice considered him in violation of a statute that forbids tampering with patriotic/historic artifacts.........only in america

      ok, so this could only happen in america.....  AUSTIN, Minnesota (AP) -- Hormel Foods has filed two legal challenges with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to prevent Spam Arrest, a Seattle software company, from using the Spam name Hormel has used for decades on its canned meat.   The trouble began about six months ago when Spam Arrest, which specializes in blocking junk e-mail or spam, filed papers to trademark its corporate name.   Hormel sent the company a warning, telling it to drop its use of Spam, which is trademark-protected. Spam Arrest refused.   "If you ask most people on the street, they're going to say junk e-mail as opposed to the luncheon meat as their first description of what spam is. I think they're overstepping their bounds," said Brian Cartmell, chief executive of Spam Arrest.   What are Hormel's chances? Cartmell says his company's use of the word has nothing to do with Hormel's product. Hormel officials disagree, arguing that the company has carefully protected and invested in the brand name.   Hormel also argues that use of the name by other companies could potentially harm its business, and that the public could confuse the meat product with the technology company.   Douglas Wood, who practices intellectual property law in New York, estimates Hormel has only a 50-50 chance of prevailing. He points to a recent case involving Victoria's Secret and a male adult novelty shop called Victor's Secret. Victoria's Secret sued, using the trademark infringement argument. But Wood says ultimately the company lost in court.   "The court in that case was saying, even though they may have a famous mark, Victoria's Secret, and may have a particular association as soon as you hear it, Victor's Secret was not enough -- the confusion or potential damage to their mark -- to constitute infringement," Wood said.   Don't use pictures of Spam Hormel acknowledges one of its most famous brand names has taken on new meaning, and in the past has made efforts to accomodate the Net community's use of the term, which was derived from a skit on Monty Python's Flying Circus. On its official Spam Web site, the company outlines what it considers acceptable use of the word. Its guidelines include referring to the potted-meat product in capital letters.   It says it doesn't object to the use of spam to describe unsolicited commercial e-mail. But the company does object to the use of pictures of its product used in association with the e-mail term.   Hormel's trademark lawsuit against Spam Arrest will be heard by the Trademark Trial and Appeals Court in Washington, D.C. No date has been set.

      ok, read this and weep....my baby pictures do really look like ecw\s.......  LONDON, England -- The theory that opposites attract is a myth, say a group of U.S. scientists who have found men and women are more likely to choose partners who are similar -- or they believe are similar -- to themselves.   Both sexes are most likely to attract individuals who look like them and have the same wealth, social status and share the same outlook towards family and fidelity, the new research suggests.   Previously, it had widely been thought that women who saw themselves as very attractive preferred socially dominant men, and men who were confident socially and economically looked for the most attractive women.   But the new research indicates that an ideal match is more important and marriage between equivalent people has the best chance of success, say the scientists from Cornell University in New York.   They believe too many differences between a couple causes instability. If one partner is better looking or has a higher social status, they may be tempted to "trade up" and find a better quality match, say the scientists.   Between similar matches there was less chance of breaking apart and therefore more stability to bring up children.   The results were based on questionnaires by 978 students aged between 18 and 24. Respondents were asked to rank the importance they placed on 10 attributes in a long-term partner.   The students were then asked to rate themselves based on the same attributes.   The attributes were grouped into four "evolutionary relevant" categories which were:    Wealth and status    Family commitment    Physical appearance    Sexual fidelity   The scientist found men and women who rated themselves highly were more selective than those who did not. Attributes that individuals rated highly in others, they also rated as important in themselves.   "Human mate choice in Western society seems to be based on a preference for long-term partners who are similar to one's perception of self across a number of evolutionary relevant categories of traits," said Peter Buston and Stephen Emlen who carried out the research.     Tennis stars Andre Agassi and wife Steffi Graf.    The findings explain why marriages between similar matches were more widespread and successful that non-matching couples.   "From the public's perspective, our results suggest that individuals seeking stable long-term relationships should not seek the highest quality partner available, but should simply look for partners who are similar to themselves," they said.   The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists Monday.   ecw and i have baby pictures that are almost identical....we have been asked if we are brother and sister......yet, there is an atrraction that goes beyond social class, expectations, etc..........22 years is quite  testament to a familial relationship.......

      ok, so while i did not watch the mtv awards, i have read about madonna's antics at the event........i want to go on record as saying that madonna has made a lot of money on scant talent........she is still in the game in her 40's, i will give her that, but what she does whilst in the game is questionable at best.......i saw her on will and grace last night, as karen's erstwhile roommate....and she was pitiable.........and looking her age......which means she should quit the overexposure world while she is ahead.........and kissing chrisitina a. and britney spears?  please...............speaking of talent-free............i suppose that brassy behavior will always draw attention away from whatever true talent there lurks on mtv...........  what i have done this week is watch lotr-the two towers over, and over, and over..........mostly with cayle, who has announced an infatuation with orlando bloom/legalos..........she speaks of him hourly.....a crush......oh my...........i cannot wait for the return of the king...........is it too early to camp out at the theatre?????????

      ok, so i dreamed last night that i was explaining to someone about blogging, but i wasn't willing to share my blog address because i did not like her and did not want her to actually read my blog.......strange how someone can be unlikeable, even in a dream.......somewhere along the dream story line i was using deaf sign language to tell someone peeking in the window to leave........since i do not know many signs, i must have been making up my own signs for this purpose.......earlier int he week i dreamed that i won the lottery...i could plainly see myself checking out the winning numbers........though i do not remember those numbers.....drat..........my class started yesterday...there are 47 in the class......a huge group........many ex-atr people going back to school...........most in group are over 30.........the class time is earlier this semester.......which allowed me to go to scw's cross-country meet....he did well in the heat...3rd in varsity run, behind a blistering run by a boy from berea, and someone from model in richmond.......boyle did not come to this meet, as 'there is not enough competition' for their boys at danville meets...........i suffered through the elementary and middle school runs first....chatting with other mothers........one mother filled me in on what her daughter told her about the 'party for juniors and seniors' on saturday night.........assuring me that her daughter had not been drinking.......of course.........i fear it will be a long 2 years until graduation, if the parties where people 'do not drink' have already started..........

      ok, so mm has survived.....the wedding for 500 or so, the baptismal luncheon with mimi, pappy and pappy's new wife.......andrew's leaving for school........after a 3 hour nap, i started making lists for everything coming up this week........and i got myself a glass of wine.........eku starts tuesday...my class is earlier this semester....3:30 rather than 6:00, which means i am home for supper or available to help with dinner at trc if it is a centre performance night........i have 46 in the class.....a person for every chair.....they actually counted before letting in the last person.........saturday is our annual biking/running event....the pound and pedal........i try every year to keep the plants alive til labor day saturday and this event.....and fail each year.......at least the grass is not dead this year like it was last year.....the good news....i cleaned house for lunch today so i am ahead of schedule.........as i sit at the computer typing, i have a clear view of andrew's empty room...he drove off to his new apartment at uk with his car loaded in such an organized manner.......i was in awe at the transition from freshman to sophomore year in terms of his logistical thinking....he made checklists with his anticipated needs for his bedroom, kitchen, bath, etc....i already miss him........tonight at supper we will be 4, eating chinese leftovers from our carryout lunch............we spent last school year as 4, but this year it will seem a bit sad, having so enjoyed having andrew home for the summer.......stephan will only remain 2 more years.....i cannot imagine his parting..........i will put off thinking about that for another day...........

      ok, so ecw tells me that i am wrong about jon...that he is just quiet and so much unlike our boy that we fail to appreciate what he does have to offer..........the other 2 children appear to be enjoying his company, and even ecw said that he has enjoyed riding with him and having him help at the shop after work.......ecw compared him to a family friend, also 16, who is quite different from our boy..........quiet, shy, not an academic stand-out......but who might win the state cross-country meet this year....if we never got past quiet and shy, we would miss the rest.........ok, so mm may be wrong..............butmm is also happy to take this boy back to the airport tomorrow so we can get back to normal......we have not been normal in our house since the last day of school in may...........we will have 3 days of normal, then acw will leave to go back to school, and we must adjust all over again.........ah well.........

      ok, so mm spent sunday making 'back-to-school' casseroles for her friends that teach school.......these days only one of 6 actually has my child in class, but it makes me happy to support women who give so selflessly in the classroom, and it allows me an excuse to make a visit......i never make time for visits, and it is shameful that i see so little of people i like and enjoy.....i also made a few 'not-going-back-to-school' casseroles, for friends who have retired or seceded from the school system........ironically, one of the people on my back to school list is talking about retiring, because the school system in general, and administrators in particular are so difficult...she recalled my reasons for leaving the hospital, and they were quite similar to her current situation.......how sad that experienced people are seen as expensive and pressure is put on them to leave so that inexperienced/less expensive people can be hired.......how sad.......

      ok, so the wedding on chrisman lane was troubling, despite it's beauty, simplicity and great food that i didn't have to prepare..........the vows that are made by people who have made before to others sound somewhat hollow.........i am not sure if the truth would be any better.....'i will love, honor and cherish you all the days of my life, or until such time that my interest fades away and i either give up or resolve myself to a life of married loneliness'.............my feelings are also colored by the lack of followthrough i have seen on the groom's part when it comes to his verbal commitment to continue to nurture my daughter after the adoption......my spouse has great hopes that the new wife....who is quite wonderful, by the way...........will help this person to organize his life in such a way that he will get back into spending time with her......cayle sees him as a father-figure......i see him as a father-figure who rarely shows up........

      ok, so mm is back from a trip that lasted less than 48 hours from the getting up on sunday morning to the going to bed on tuesday morning....i am exhausted in the 'feeling like i have been beat up/old' kind of tired........my feet hurt, my eyes are swollen from pollen or mold, and my head is pounding......but i did have a good time.......turns out the highlight of the trip to d.c. was the side trip to dedaleus book warehouse that is on rt. 32 between bwi and my in-laws house.......i bought 3 books at $4.98 each and could have purchased more but i knew that i had no room for them in either my purse or small satchel........all three books are travel essays/we bought this house in france/ireland/sicily and this is how we labored to fix it up and get along with/be accepted by our neighbors.......you know the year in provence formula.........but this is my fanatasy...to buy a house in europe and fix it up.........the mall in dc was dreadfully hot,,,with intermittent showers.....steam rose from the sidewalks after each rain......lots of security....besides the book warehouse, my trip highlights include....the terrace outside the botanic gardens that was done up in a martha stewart kind of 'this is how you can do pot/containers at your house with heirloom vegetables and flowers......it was a stunning array of clever ideas........julia child's kitchen at the smithsonian (american history), whistler's peacock room from the frick.........the big naked guy from the hirschorn........not the naked part...just the realness of the piece of art......the birdcage guy sculpture by rene magritte at the hirschorn........the gem exhibit at natural history...........and last, but not least, visiting my in-laws extensive gardens, especialy sitting by the fountain in the older fish/lily pond reading the paper, drinking coffee, and watching the lilies open........in my nightgown and robe......there is nothing more deilcious than that level of leisure......did jpon have a good time......hard to tell, as he said maybe 20 words in 2 days, despite courageous efforts on the part of my in-laws to get him to say more than yes or no........my sister-in-law whispered when we left that she will pray for us.........

      ok, so because of mm's antiquated o.s. (this pc uses windows 95 or 98.......) her screen for blogging shows no past entries,,,,,therefore it is up to her feeble memory to recall subjects of past blogs without  painstaking waits for screens to load.....forgive her if she repeats herself from time to time.......it is early. scw and the bb and i are leaving shortly for the louisville airport for our whirlwind tour of the nation's capitol.......the bb is merely an excuse.....we would have relished a quick trip to dc whether he was here or not.......the last time we visited cayle was a real jerk, so nobody really got to enjoy any exhibits.......i am looking forward to the special diamond exhibit.....i do not desire to own them, but i do like to look at them......if i were to be presented with something precious, i would prefer pearls over stones.......i feel much more connected to their feel, their underwater quality (it is the piscean in me....) and the something extra they add to dressing up or dressing down......i enjoyed especially the pearl exhibit i saw in chicago, but cayle was being difficult that day too............anyway, i hardly slept last night for fears about plane crashes, terrorists, etc. such are the risks of travel, i suppose......that fall counter to all of the pleasures that come with wanderlust......if my time is up, it might as well be on a trip.....travel is one of my life's major passions.......but i would surely prefer the return leg of the journey be my last, not the first..........

      ok, so the american icon tour continues tomorrow with the mall and assorted smithsonian museums, and monuments........we have about 10-12 hours of total downtown time..........and no agenda other than to see everything.........scw and i have been to downtown dc many times.......but there is always something new to see at american history or natural history..or the national gallery........i like the indoor waterfall in the national gallery cafeteria designed by i m pei.........of course, i am worried to fly during a time of high alert...........but then, being mean, i will probably head-butt a would-be terrorist for attempting to ruin my 2 days off........i am also looking forward to seeing roseanne and nick, my in-laws........

      ok, so mmm has the belgian boy blues..........last night after dinner he actually pointed out that his laundry is ready for me to do.......i was ready for that one........i quickly explained that scw would be showing him how to do his own laundry so that he doesn't have to wait on my schedule to get it done......(my schedule being when hell freezes over.....) i alkso explained that our children trade off on table setting/clearing and doing dishes, and that he should really help scw when it is his turn to do these chores........he looked at me like i had 3 heads.........thankfully, ecw interceded and showed jon how to run both the washer and dryer.......these skills are valuable...he will thank me one day.........especially if his mamma passes on and she is no longer there to wait on him hand and foot........

      ok, so mm will get to see the stinky arum plant st the national botanical gardens.......as mentioned in the lex herald lead this morning.....it is blooming for the first time in 10 years......and smells like rotten meat........i am getting concerned that my sister-in-law has not called me back to confirm that she will pick us up at the airport.(bwi).......we could not only be stranded closer to baltimore than to dc, but we could also have no place to stay......

      ok, so mm wants to talk about 'doing the wash'...........she has seen the exchange student's wash basket travel ever so subtlely from the corner to near the door, to the door ......like someone is supposed to notice that it needs washing..........i have got news.......in this family...if you are able to do your own wash, you do your own wash..........andrew does his own wash, scw washes his own clothes, and cayle is learning..........i mentioned the washbasket thing this morning to family members........who do not work fulltime, and who could show the exchange student how to do the wash......but tonight, the basket is still there by the door, begging to be thrown in the wash cycle........ mean mamma is not biting........

      ok, so mm was surprised to read a review of her restaurant in this morning's herald leader.....the reviewers came at supper, and were pleased with the soup, the appetizers in general...though they considered the procuito ham sliced too thick.....they did not like the canned mandarin oranges on the spinach salad, and they considered our cheesecake prosaic........now prosaic is not a word one hears often.......i interpret it as meaning basic, or boring......yeh, vanilla cheesecake is pretty basic.........it is what it is......all in all the review was decent publicity.........though they made a snide remark about our main dining room's decor.........which i consider to be quite nice, by the way...........so what about those mandarin oranges?

      ok, so i am catering supper for my church tomorrow evening, and my family, who agreed to help, is falling away..........i can do it without help...but this is not how i planned it to be.....  i went to watch scw run tonight at the stadium...he did quite well.........i go to these events to talk to the other mothers just as much as to watch my son......i spoke more to the boyle mothers, for some strange reason..........one woman, who i have always envisioned as a latent hippy, is finally divorcing the husband that left her several years ago and MOVED AWAY.........because she finally figured out that he came back to danville not to the see the children but to visit his girlfriend.......she has lost weight, and could really end up with the last laugh in this whole affair...........of course, i may just be a latent hippy....but that is another story.............

      ok, so i did not get the movie lost in translation, but i did enjoy the reviews that popped up on google when scarlett johansonn's name is typed in............obviously i am not existential.....gentle readers...there have been many clues to this reality, and while i am lonely, i did not 'click' with their version of loneliness.............

      ok, so the pope name a slew of new cardinals last week, including one 'unnamed'..........for reasons known only to the pope...the theory is that it is someone in hong kong/china, which allows no religion let alone catholocism...but i am wondering about other possibilities.....is it me?  I would make a great cardinal, despite being baptist and feminist, and somewhat disrespectful of most public shows of religious fervor.......maybe the unnamed post is reserved for the pope's 'secret friend'.....is is old and somewhat senile....maybe his childhood secret friend has returned..........

      ok, so george w may have really done it this time.........when his white house leaks the name of an undercover cia operative, who happens to be the wife of the former ambassador who publically disagreed with your wof massdestruction theory that started the war...then things may get ugly for the white house..........breaking the cover of a cia operative is a felony......which puts w in a real pickle if the buck stops with him......this may be better than nixon's watergate..............

      ok, so we went to all of my intended destinations except the last 2.........the yale thing was interesting, and the movie was also 'interesting'....which is shorthand for mm did not understand it......there were many funny parts, but i clearly missed the point...........bill murray was good in playing an aging actor whose best work seems to have been behind him......i did like the part where scarlet johannson says that she is mean.........ah well............

      ok, so mm is looking forward to alias, tonight at 9:00...........one of the few shows that i watch faithfully..........which means that we must make it back from lex by then after all of the stops.........at least 1 goodwill, the yale recruiter at the downtown library, the kentucky theatre to see lost in translation, wild oats and joseph-beth.........that's all  i have in mind.......  this morning cayle and i waited in line to go through the light at 3rd and lexington....right in front of the older rodes' new driveway....there were 2 snakes crossing their driveway..........we became concerned that they would try to cross traffic, and that we would run them over.........much as i do  not like snakes i do not want them to die under my tires........thankfully, they both vered (veared,viered,veered?) off into the grass going toward the large, lovely rodes house on the corner..........  last night after work, the old-enough and the almost old-enough c-w's lined up the beers from the friday night octoberfest beertasting for our own tasting........well.........i have never tasted such things before...even when traveling in germany during octoberfest (on our honeymoon)....there was one beer that scw described as a 'belly-beer', which turned out to not be half as dark and thick as the one we finally called the 'gravy' beer...........there was one the color of pumpkin juice that had a strange, un-identifiable aftertaste that was unpleasing,  another that was the color of dark urine......we did not like that one either..........there was a smooth-ish one that was semi-dark that was at least drinkable.........the kentucky light ale...not even from germany.......was the easiest to drink........i guess we of germanic origin lack the dark beer gene.....or at least it is severely suppressed.......i am reminded of our trip to lambsheim, and how cousin edwin was so pleased that our whole group liked their beer.......but i remember that beer as much lighter and smoother than any we tasted last night...........  my spouse thinks that my plan to spend a long weekend in paris in january is craziness, which means that i will probably figure out how to make it work.......i want to go to the smaller 'house' museums, and eat well both lunch and supper, and buy lots of french literature for scw's ap test/sat II test, and drink cafe au lait in cafes warmed by open fires, and order sancerre by the bottle of the wine list, and maybe find another neat needlepoint pillow kit.........that's all i want out of this potential trip........

      ok, so mm slept through the alarm, and it is now 9:15 am.........too late to get dressed and to sunday school on time........so i will blow off sunday school and get dressed in leisurely fashion for church at 10:45 am..........i just cannot be rushed on sundays, which have become my sole day off........i was able to read the front page of the danville paper before scw took it away.......dawn shultz had an accident on friday, and a 48-year old woman on a motorcycle was killed............this is a parent's worst nightmare........you let your child drive on his(her) own, and you just know that disaster will happen.......i feel quite sad for the shultz family...........

      ok, so stephan and i drove all the way to covington this afternoon to hear the princeton recruiter..........and arrived early because there were no traffic stoppages.......who knew?.............i will let scw blog about exactly who else was there from the greater lex/louisville/cincy area..........i just want to go on record as stating that there is a restaurant in cincy/northern ky called shanghai mamma (we had extra time so we looked at all of the travel brochures in the marriott lobby........) when i tire of mean mamma i may just transform myself into shanghai mamma...i understand that this may entail learning mandarin chinese......but no sacrifice is to heavy for art.......................

      ok, so it is very mean of me to enjoy the california recall as much as i do........especially the coverage of last night's debate, which deteriorated into a shouting match of sound bytes with little actual attention to issues......it will be quite a blow to the republicans if they( as in arnold) fails to win the governor's position.........i am also pleased to see that dem candidates for president are going after bush and his iraq policy, as well as focusing hard on bush's failure to maintain the economy left by clinton......the majority of amercians do not favor throwing an extra 50 billion or so into iraq, and it is clear that neither france nor germany are going to do it either.........dubya may be left holding the empty bag next election.............

      ok, so we adults in this household have become obsessed with the big book of colleges............much more than any one fellow resident who might be looking for the right 'fit'............we enjoy looking at entrance average act/sat scores, overlap schools, liberal versus conservative bent.........we are amused that the average sat scores of many schools are less than what our beloved got in the 7th grade.......i personally like the sound of reed college in oregon, but that is too far away...........ecw likes the sound of wooster, not just because he went to school there...........my mother claims that antioch is too 'far out', so scw will probably apply.............

      ok, so mm is feeling a bit rough this morning, what with driving to cincinnati and back last night........ecw and i attended a surprise 30th wedding anniversary party for friends of his......he started elementary parochial school with the groom.....played little league on a team coached by the groom's dad.........partied hearty with the groom all through high school........but the groom decided to get married rather than go to college......which seemed foolish to everyone but the bride and groom at the time.......ecw was the best man,.....though he remembers little of the event......we were glad that we made the effort to go, because we really did have a great time.......so many people ecw remembered from the old 'parish' neighborhood of st. ceceilia.......these people never stopped going to st cecelia.........even ecw's little sister and her husband were there.....that was a pleasant surprise...........the only downside to the evening was the smoke......at least 80% of those present (an estimate-i didn't count) smoked......constantly...........and drank hard............i amy have to burn my clothes....the stench of smoke lingers.....we did enjoy the music...mostly from high school and college.............just like an old-time singalong..........some were newer tunes.........something called booty call, in which many got up and did some sort of line dance, as with the electric slide......apparantly these are big in the cincy wedding circuit...........i was not moved to dance, however...........it takes a lot more than 2 glasses of wine for me to get up and dance............

      ok, so i have finished the flanders panel, and found the ending lacking.............great mysteries require that the actual bad guy have some sort of motive...........this bad guy lacked both badness (other than the fact that he killed a few people............) and opportunity to profit by his crime........so why bother, other than for the challenge of not getting caught......

      ok, so mm is reading a new book...the flanders panel......quite compelling for a suspense novel/chess lesson.......the premise is a flemish painting of 2 men playing chess with a woman in black watching........words seen only upon xray prior to restoration/auction are mysterious......who took the knight? (or who killed the knight, depending on translation of choice.........) so the story is about the restorer who is trying to find out who the people pictured were, and if the 'knight' in the picture was in fact killed.....you get it.......the plot requires that the chess game in the picture be replayed/backtracked.......quite interesting.......

      ok, so mm loved this article.... LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Whether it's curled up in the fetal position, flat on the stomach or stretched out across the bed, the way people sleep reveals their personality, a British sleep expert said on Tuesday.   Professor Chris Idzikowski, director of the Sleep Assessment and Advisory Service and a visiting professor at the University of Surrey in southern England, has identified six common sleep positions and what they mean.   "We are all aware of our body language when we are awake but this is the first time we have been able to see what our subconscious says about us," he said.   Crouched in the fetal position is the most popular sleep pattern and favored by 51 percent of women, according to the results of the study he conducted for a large hotel group.   Fetal sleepers tend to be shy and sensitive while people who assume the soldier position, flat on their back with arms at their sides, are quiet and reserved.   Sleeping on one's side with legs outstretched and arms down in what Idzikowski refers to as the log, indicates a social, easy-going personality. But if the arms are outstretched, the person tends to be more suspicious.   The freefall, flat on the tummy with the hands at the sides of the head, is the most unusual position. Only 6.5 percent of people prefer it and they are usually brash and gregarious.   Unassuming, good listeners usually adopt the starfish position -- on the back with outstretched arms and legs.   Idzikowski, who identified the positions by comparing personality traits of people, their preferred way of sleeping and the most common positions, said once a sleeping style is adopted it is rarely changed.   "What's interesting is that the profile behind the posture is often very different from what we would expect," he added in a statement.

      ok, so mm feels a need to come clean on her sorority past............in her mid-sophomore year of college she joined chi omega sorority, whose members at the time included her cousins marilyn and becky crown...............in her senior year she was voted as the active member least likely to pay a visit to the sorority house.......a distinction she takes pride in.........while i never really bought into the entire ra-ra sisterhood thing, membership was an interesting experience......i did meet 1 person with whom i maintain contact, who i would never have met had it not been for that affiliation......when i moved to danville, the affiliation was quite valuable......i can count on both hands the people i maintain friendships with that i met in some way related to chi omega.......

      ok, so mm may be blogging now that the 'upstairs' computer has been fixed.....alas, it has also be virtually wiped clean.....but that is another story....it is fixed and it is back.......i am almost finished with a heartbreaking story of staggering genius, an outstanding book of wit amongst tragedy...........a brief example..........he includes diagragms of the series of apartments in which he lives in the course of the story, not to show basic living arrangements, but to show the direction and length to which he and his brother can slide across the floor in socks.............this just cracks me up............. he includes menus that he and his brother (age 8) have concocted using their favorite ingredients (their taco recipe is curious at best) as well as an extensive set of standards by which potential girlfriends will be judged on the basis of their reaction to said menus...........i am enjoying this book immensely, and consider it to be great literature, as it is both engaging and accessible to the reader, as opposed to absalom,absalom, which was neither........

      ok, so book club was interesting........i, and the person who picked the book, were the only people to actually finish it.......everyone else bailed somewhere amongst the confusion that is absalom,absalom...some read only a few pages before picking up a more interesting book......i finished it because i was afraid i would be the only one there who had not finished it...........thus the discussion.......how can a book so painful to read, with such a painful story line, be considered great literature, especially when there are so many books that are so readable and with great stories............anyway, i am glad that this book is behind us.....next....to kill a mockingbird.......

      ok, so mm is still feeling mean, but not so exceptionally mean..........i enjoyed hearing blips from last night's dem debate....especially dennis d. kucinich from ohio, who in the distant past survived a recall vote when he was mayor of cleveland........by something like 236 votes....i only remember such details because there was a cute song written about cleveland (and the river that burned, and the ex-mayor's wife who wouldn't have dinner with mrs. gerald ford because it interfered with her bowling night......among other things) ah wel..........one of my waitresses plays volleyball for centre, and she has been keeping us abreast of the phenom named adair who will be on a cosmo cover and who will arrive back in danville with the car she won.......but is she any good at volleyball?  this morning, as per usual, my junk mail file is awash in promises for fuller breasts....ha...........when i win the lottery i am having them reduced, and may even fund public service announcements warning women that large breasts are annoying both day and night....just try finding a comfortable place to put them while you sleep...........

      ok, so i am feeling exceptionally mean today.......no small task for the mean mamma...........just a day that such meanness should have been allowed to stay home in bed, or better.....in my closet looking at how organized it remains 2 days later...........i have les than 24 hours to fiish absalom,absalom........such a dreary tome.......i want to get back to a heartbreaking work of staggering genius, which was easier to read despite the tragic subject matter......turns out we own the book because i bought it for andrew for christmas........so much for shortterrm memory loss.............anyway, i also need to get the remaining book club books...the ones i do not own, like grham greene's the quiet american........so i can get ahead just in case i find something else i want to read whilst i should be reading the book club book.........so many books, too little time.......

      ok, so i am blgging at work while my test is printing on the copier...all 48 copies for my biggest class ever............i have been scanning cnn for late-breaking news......i am particularly intrigued by the advent of the new $20 bill this fall...the peachy one.........to m,ake the $20 more distictive, and presumably harder to fake, it will take on a peachy glow........that should coordinate well with my imagined aura, which also has a peachy glow.........alas, as a parent, i have few $20's in my possession............................

      ok, so mm cleaned out her closet today......in a big way.......tossed into the goodwill pile things not worn in past year.......organized sweaters and shoes into neat hanging shelving things.........then reshelved about 25 books, that were lurking under my side of the bed........too much cleaning for one day....then i took a nice little nap...........

      ok, so this morning's 56 degrees will surely take the lake temp down several degrees......i see my afterwork swims ending soon.......to be replaced by treadmill walking, which is not so much fun...........i am sad at the end of summer.........i enjoyed listening to bits of the dem. debate this morning on npr........i am encouraged that people like dean are going after the bush jugular when it comes to war and the economy............i see many cracks in the bush reelection armor...........also on news this morning was discussion of whether john hinckley jr should be allowed to go and visit his parents.....he has been in a mental hospital for 22 years after being aquitted by a jury of the attempted murder of reagan by reason of insanity.......the argument for letting him visit his parents.....if he had been convicted his 20 years would have been up and he would be out of prison by now.........this was the guy so in love with jody foster that he wanted to do in reagen to show her how much he cared............certainly he was more than a deranged stalker......but 22 years in a mental hospital certainly has bought him the priviledge to visit his parents in their home.........and surely he has gotten over jody, now that she has 2 children by someone else...........

      ok, so mm is reading absalom,absalom for book club, and she cannot help but to invision the role of narrator (aunt rosa) who is younger than the neice in the story and who was briefly engaged to her neice's father(her late older sister's husband) played by bette davis......i cannot get bette davis out of my head when i read rosa's dialogue.........i have no faces to put to other character's, and i have gone so far to determine that there has not been a movie version of this book (at least not one sold at half.com)...........maybe madonna will want to option it and try this part for herself as a way to reinvent herself as a serious actress.............

      ok, so the computer upstairs has crashed/gone haywire......whenever it is turned on, it makes a beeping sound, and no signal reaches the monitor, so it just sits there acting crazy until it is unplugged........it will not turn off by the off switch these days...........yesterday's blog was executed on scw's computer....in the hallowed hall that is his room.........in a daring daytime invasion of his personal space............

      ok, so yesterday i went to lexington to do a little goodwill shopping.........drove up in ecw's convertible with the top down......lovely drive on route 68 through the palisades listening to prairie home companion..........located the goodwill on clay's mill, though was unimpressed.......whoever puts stuff on racks cannot tell men's from women's things, nor adult clothing from children's clothing.......both men's and women's shirts and pants appeared to be smashed together, plus the a.c. was out, so the store was like a sauna.....i left without purchasing anything........i did find some nice limited too and gap things for cayle..........ecw wants me to downplay the purchase of goodwill items when it comes to cayle, lest she think that she isn't worth spending money on...........or worse, that we are too poor to dress her properly.........bottom line.....i find the purchase of gently used clothing to be a fine bargain, that allows the savings to be used for travel......scw is laughing at my last statement............i will not erase it as i will not be edited by my children.........  on the way back i got caught in the tremendous downpour......it was raining so hard that i pulled off into a church parking lot to wait out the worst of it..........and listened to le show while i waited...........that is a radio broadcast that one must be in a certain mood to enjoy............

      ok, so mm had an unexpected happy hour today, when the l.o.'s parents...free spirits both...came my way......i enjoyed the ends of 3 bottles of wine....a sauvigon blanc and 2 chardonays.......such is the plight of an owner.....one hates to drink anything people would pay for..........so i drank what was unsellable unless another bottle was opened.......i was reminded of how much i enjoyed happy hour in cincinnati at the blind lemon...5 to 7 pm, drinking 2 beers and playing backgammon with friends.........with good conversation........mostly we talked about children, and getting children into college....but that is our lot in life at this point.........thanks......to the l.o.'s loyal parents for a lovely diversion................

      ok, so mm wants to talk painkillers, or lack thereof.......i have managed this entire week of pain on a bit of ibuprofin and aspirin, rather than prescription meds, because they representr a place i do not care to go...the rush limbaugh place of woe, as an example.......though i have been quite uncomfortable, i fear that i may get to like these painkillers...and tragedy would surely follow.........i suppose that is also the point, if i still have pain, i know to be careful...with painkillers i would not feel the need to be watchful of my posture, my lifting, my 'position' in doing anything....and i might end up more injured than i already am........this position seems strange to others, especially to the workmate who offered his prescription pain meds to me just yesterday..........who seemed quite confused that i would refuse........i pointed out the warning about drowsiness........anyway, it is friday morning, and aspirin isn't quite enough, but it will have to do.......

      ok, so mm was delighted yesterday when someone she knew brought by a bag of halloween 'buckeyes'..........for non-buckeyes (anyone unluckily enough to be been in any state other than ohio) 'buckeyes' are peanut butter balls dipped partially in chocolate stabilized with wax to make them resemble real buckeyes..........i was quite touched, as i had not had a peanut butter/chocolate buckeye in years.....and only managed to eat part of one because they are soooooooosweeeeeeeet.......it was the thought that counted........i have in my pocket right now a real buckeye......one from my grandpa's tree in independence, ohio........i have at home a buckeye given to me by my grandpa on the way to the cleveland airport in september 1981 (we were going on our european honeymoon......)  i carry my buckeye for good luck..........

      ok, so my mom and i had a pretty good conversation tonight, after she brought cayle home.....cayle, who was too sick to go trick-or-treating........who started in moaning on the coach when asked to start her homework....she who had been quiet all day until homeowrk was brought up...............anyway, my mom and i got to talking about the florida right-to-die case that republican jeb bush has 'championed'.........my mother, who is a life-long republican, is totally against the re-instatement of the tube in this woman who has been in a vegetative state for 13 years.....'your father would have been horrified if i had insisted on a tube',.......she recalled......yes, he would have been.....and though it was pitiful to watch him slowly starve to death (nov 18, 2002) it was much better than to watch him linger for years..........none of this playing god business.....it would have been playing god to put a tube in, not the other way around..............to our family, we let him go to his maker in a serene, positive way....not grasping for life that was no longer there..............hard to believe that a whole year has passed..........

      ok, so mm cannot remember is she has mentioned her aching back.......which she strained sunday whilst catering lunch at her church..............i was in such pain yesterday that i called the chiropractor across the street and got an early afternoon appt............say what you will abouth this potentially dubious group of practitioners.....i do feel better after having seen my xrays- which showed my pelvis twisted to the point that one hip was 1.5 inches higher on one side and rotated to the point that a nerve was pinched........after some 'adjustment' i did feel better.....and slept some better, but i have a long way to go before i can say that i am 'back' to normal......

      ok, so when mm runs out of new literature to read, she always goes back to the best of the classics.....madame colette has such a way with words, with sentiment, with life's rough patches, with guarded optimism.....the book i chose at random....the blue lantern, is one of her last published works.....the blue lantern refers to the blue light she kept on in her palais royale apartment when she wrote....on her blue paper.....the book reads like a blog............a freely written memoir of the end of her life......the part i have re-enjoyed so far remembers her last trip to a spa in switzerland for treatment of her arthritis and to 'reduce'....she asks for cheese a nd butter to go along with her bread at breakfast, and she is told that there is none...........'what? in the land of gruyere you have no cheese?'.....she admonishes...........i suppose it if ever win the lottery...like the minnesota lunch ladies..........i will buy a paris apartment in palais royale.............and blog on a blue-screened laptop...........

      ok, so i visited a blog called bigwhiteguy.com, which was featured on cnn.com this morning as a blog of note..........this guy has t-shirts, books, the whole nine yards for sale......all as a spinoff of his blog from hong kong...............he allows no comments.....so i could not comment on the banality of what i had read.........maybe i am just jealous of the cnn coverage......mm is no blog of note, by any means...........more of a whine of note.........

      ok, so mm has had a moment of confusion today.......i was sitting reading the paper(s) after work, and i though to myself, 'gosh, you need a vacation...you haven't gone anywhere....' and then i was reminded of my own reality......since january i have been to spain, to washington dc twice, to williamsburg, to monticello, to mammath caves, to graceland, to yellowstone/grand tetons.................three plane trips............not babd for not having gone anywhere..........

      ok, so this is sunday and the only good reason for sunday is alias at 9:00 pm....if not for that show i would have already gone to bed.........i am thinking about fixing supper.....which seems silly, as cayle has eaten continuously throughout the day........popcorn, 2 bananas, an apple, hot cocoa, cheese melted on crackers.......on and on.......we are all edgy until scw comes home from campaigning...in jessamine county....by himself.....or so it seems.........

      ok, so mm is enjoying crab cakes for breakfast.....freshly fried crabcakes no less.........i popped into the restaurant this morning at 7:00 am to put a few things in the oven....i am catering a luncheon......and said crab cakes were in the fridge leftover from last night.......i fried up the lot of them for my family to have for lunch.....i was afraid that if left to my family to cook...they would be baked or microwaved or worse......crab cakes are certainly not at the top of the decadence scale........that slot is reserved for smoked lox salmon and caper/sour cream/cucumber sauce..........oh my.......

      ok, so mm registered to vote in ohio at age 18, with her parents present, as a republican........that was the year that nixon resigned over watergate......then promptly changed parties when she moved to ky in 1982...........i lived through the reagen years,  thrived during the clinton years despite the blue dress and cigars.....and live vicariously through the bush fiasco years.............knowing he will go the way of his father 1 term and out..............

      ok, so mm is getting sentimental, and it is all jeb's fault.................my dad died almost a year ago, from the starvation and dehydration that comes when loving family members say 'we want no heroics, or machines, or tubes'....he could no longer take food from a spoon or liquid from a cup.......and sometime in the 1st few weeks of november he drifted off to be with his god .........his choice.....having coached us all to his wishes....none of this 'i know that he heard me when i was close to his face because he grunted...........that is pure shit as far as i am concerned.....if these florida parents truly believe in heaven, they will let their child float there peacefully............rather than post her image on their website in her peculiar state of vegetation...............a fate worse than death......to be posted on a web site with one's mouth open and one's brain vacant.................which brings me to another fate worse than death........pregnancy against one's will........i have mentioned in this blog that my children share a greatgrandparent who died from complications of a backstreet ilegal abortion,....none of this partial-birth crap.....there is no such procedure.............the circumstances mentioned are those of a woman fighting for life.....her life before an infants life.........no more, no less.............this bill passed with much fanfare will surely be struick down by the supremes because it makes no provision for saving the mm's life.......duh...that is the only reason why the circumstances exist.............by the time pregnancy reaches this state, it is either delivery or death for the mother or the baby...............i would hope that my spouse chose me over the unborn........not some nitwit senator or governer, or c-average republican president..............

      ok, so mm admits that she is competitive......and when a parent of a senior came into trc today, and spoke of a school in ohio close to her family's heart, where her boy had visited, and lowrated it because they only would promise tuition and not room and board to her child, she had to bite her tongue when the subject of test scores came up.....this child had taken the plan test, and only came up with a composite 28..................well, mm could have launched into a diatribe about superior test scores............but she chose to just stand and smile.............

      ok, so mm had a marvelous visit with her friend jane...over lunch and champagne, after her dad finally got her electronic wheelchair hoist that is fitted inside her van to retract........that took phone calls to the manufacturer, no less........we needed bubbly after that ordeal.........the first thing her mom told me was about her sister whose husband left her after nearly 25 years of marriage just about the time her job was 'downsized' out of her company........so sad......we did have a good visit, and jane looks great.......  the teeth whitening torture continues......i am able to wear these devices 4 hours total a day, though not in one single stretch.......i can see results, but these results have not translated into a desire to put up with discomfort for any longer than necessary..............

      ok, so mm's friend jane is coming to eat lunch with me tomorrow......i have known jane...aka as mommy's friend jane, longer than i have known my spouse..........in fatc, i can honestly say that every memorable hangover i can recall involved jane in the preamble....she was with me, along with our mutual friend beth.....the very last time, in 1981, that i ever drank tequilla..............she had a boyfriend who owned a bar in mt adams (where i lived before i met ecw) who gave her 1 bottle of t. and a bottle of triple sec, and we made margueritas and watched beth's slides of luxembourg until we could drink and watch no more........we were trying to plan my honeymoon (three weeks of camping in europe), but mostly we drank and had a great time............jane has been to the continent more times than i have been, though not as many times to france.......she is much more diversified............anyway, i could tell(blog) jane stories ad infinitum............jane is one of the reasons why i live to travel on a regular basis........you just never know when the other shoe will fall........jane was diagnosed with m.s. several years ago, and is basically wheelchair-bound........she continues to travel agressively nevertheless, but not without difficulty.........tomorrow we will have champagne, even though i will be at work.....because i always have champagne when i am with jane.........even on the marguirita night........we had a bottle of champagne...........you gotta love a woman who loves champagne.......

      ok, so mm is now undergoing the teeth-whitening torture............this has involved a trip to the dentist.....impressions made of both upper and lower teeth (the gagging involved with the making of the impressions should have tipped me off to the pain and discomfort ahead.......) the impressions are turned into custom-fitted clear plastic plates that are to be worn with the chemical bleaching gel at least 4-6 hours daily for 2 weeks...............so far i have been able to tolerate 1 hour on the top and 1 hour on the bottom, never both plates at the same time......because all i can think about is how i am choking and soon to die......i cough, i gag, and i tear up.....it is totally awful, and i would quit if i hadn't already paid for it..........i lasted an hour this morning because i resorted to lamaze breathing................i will try sleeping with these things this evening....maybe unconciousness is the only answer.........

      ok, so mm got a 'personal' letter from glenna fletcher today in the mail, along with 2 'personal' snapshots of herself and ernie graduating from lafayette hs in 1970, and another one of their children taken in 1982............she, was of course, asking me to send a financial contribution to ernie's gov campaign...........let me tell you, glenna, why the check will not be in the mail.......1&2) you misspelled my name and left out the hyphen.....an unforgivable fauxpaus....if you know me so well, you would know how to spell my name..........3) i am a DEMOCRAT.........my finger has never touched the repulbican part of the screen.........4) i have seen ernie in person, long ago at constitution square festival...........he reminded me of a suspicious jockey......short and creepy.......5) i do not like those digging dog ads aimed at chandler.............6) i hear tell that ernie might have himself a ladyfriend..........one that is not his wife.......but maybe glenna has chosen not to notice...in the fine tradition of politician's wives.............

      ok, so i catered the centre trustees dinner tonight,.....but this pales by comparison to serving lunch to the mother of one of scw's old montesorri 'chums', who went on to private school in a southern state after bate........his mum contends that he turned down the parson school of design because there is no green space in ny...(how can one turndown a school one visited as a sophomore?)...........he will surely attend the design school in savannah.......he is such a flw afficinado, though he has not been to fallingwater,.......his mum has purchased him a secular book on that very place/subject for xmas.....by the way........she seemed cunfused about its exact location, and seemed ultimately annoyed that scw had actually been there.........she did make comment on the reality that her boy will have to pay full price for college because of their income.......i had to pinch myself to stop from a true guffaw......the poverty we chose after i quit the hospital has allowed quite a financial aid windfall...........when both of the boys are in school we should make out like bandits.........we hope...........

      ok, so today is the first day of fall break, and though i have to work every day and several evenings, i am thoroughly enjoying my slowed down morning routine with an extra cup of coffee and a blog before i take a shower and get dressed...........i spent yesterday doing continuing education articles and posttests..........when i mail in the paperwork i should be near to the 15 hours of required cont. ed required by the state of ky.......ironically, i reattainment of  my certified diabetes educator credential was worth a full 5 years of cont ed according to the american dietetics assn, but the state of ky does not see things that way.........ah well, this ordeal is nearly over...........i enjoyed alias last night......the only reason to wish for sunday evening is alias.........as we began this season, sydney's boyfriend vaughn has gotten married, because he thought she was dead these past 2 years.....the 2 years that sydney was thought to be dead after the fire at her apartment and the positive dna match from remains found.......well, it wasn't sydney, and now she is trying to find out just where she was and what she did during the past 2 years......lots of drama, suspense, and intrigue....i may ask for the first season on dvd for xmas.......

      ok, so mm's mamma has left the state of kentucky, with my precious boy scw, bound for ohio to visit colleges...........oberlin, kenyon, wooster, dennison, and miami of ohio..........mm's mamma offered to run him by osu and ou, as well (my alma mater is osu and hers is ou) but scw graciously declined.........for my part, i have no need for my son to attend my alma mater, especially when its campus hosts 48,000 students and his chosen major us available at much smaller venues...........i fear for them both on the road.......grandma is getting to be a careless driver and scw is a novice driver............i will pray hourly until they return.........  ecw went on a 'century' ride today, so he was not at church..............cayle and i decided to go to wah mei in harrodsburg, since there were only 2 of us........i had almost forgotten how people behave at buffets......we each made just one trip, and filled just one plate.............and i still feel overful from that one plate......but others who we were there when we arrived were still there when we left........still eating...........  i am blogging prior to my daring daytime assault upon my mother's house...........now that she is away, i am going in with trash bags to tidy up...........she is not one who keeps up with newspapers, catalogs, junk mail, recycling, and over time this clutter gets out of control...........she appears not to notice...........when i try to clean up when she is home, she finds reasons why she must keep every scrap that i am trying to throw away............and nothing really gets accomplished...........so i swoop in when she is gone.........and added bonus....i get to watch cable tv for a brief fix.........

      ok, so tonight i met the nationally known radio guy who owns a big piece of property out on bluegrass pike........the gut who hosted fletcher's fundraiser and never asked us to bid on the event..........the guy who orders 'old' wine with corks that tend to crumble...............the guy who seemed intrigued about someone whose entire family has a hypenated last name....he said he could arrange for arnold to visit........i said as a closet liberal i had no need.........bad choice of words......there is nothing cloistered about my politics.......................

      ok, so tonight the newest hewlett-packard ad featured images from parc guell(sp...) one of my favorite spots in barcelona.........the view was from the undulating wall/bench that forms the bounderies of the terrace covering the cool cavernous space below...where flutists play eeeire melodies.........the bench is covered in broken bits of crockery that are harmonious in color, texture and form..........a really remarkable place to visit........

      ok, so mm neglected to mention the painful 40 minutes spent at cayle's soccer team picture gathering.........cayle promptly got out of the car and went directly to the play area at millenium, rather than to the picture area as per instruction..........i marched over there when others from her team began to gather there, rather than in the desginated picture area...........and attempted to redirect the throng toward their goal..........on the way over someone's dog took over cayle's short-term memory slots.........and another march over became necessary............at this point, even the photographer got out of her truck and tried to round up these girls so that pictures could proceed.........of course, the individual pictures were done first, with the remaining team trying to kick each other over with a soccer ball on the nearest field...... it became apparant that no one was driving this bus, when we were all standing around, even the photographer waiting for something to happen..........i suggested to the photographer that now might be a good time to round up everybodyt for the group shot....she said she was waiting ont he coach to say so.......the coach that was shooting soccer balls with the team in the field......paying not the least attention to the photo-session..............ergo, 40 minutes in- a picture was taken, and we drove frantically to anderson-dean to watch scw run cross-country............need not have rushed, as the meet was behind, and his race was over 30 minutes delayed...........he did well, by the way...a strong second place........

      ok, so mm and md went to see porgy and bess last night..........with tickets given by a student....we sat up next to god, just a few rows from the top........lts of empty student seats, by the way........we appreciated the subtitles flashed on the screen above the stage.......else we would not have understood what was going on, even when sung in english....or gullah as it were.........beyond the songs like summertime, and i got plenty of nothin...........the songs were rather boring and contrived............so much for opera........i need never attend one again.........

      ok, so mm has new glasses....which look vaguely like her old glasses.....except these are no-line trifocals.......which curiously give one a feeling of sea-sickness if one rotates the head from side to side too quickly.......happily, mm does not reside in california, the state of fools in my opinion...somehow they think that this man can balance the budget while preserving schools, after-school programs, and social services..........arnold has no clue, possibly because he does not manage his own checkbook....he pays others to do that, and he has millions of dollars of his own to toy with............as does his wife..........now there is a couple who live in the real world.............well, california will certainly get what they deserve.........

      ok, so i blogged numerous times on friday, then nothing...........acw came home for a few quality hours on saturday night.......he did his laundry, we ate chinese take-out, and we bought groceries to keep him going another 2 weeks..........he looks great, he is in upbeat spirits, and he seems appears to be enjoying his classes.....sunday's nhs induction was short but sweet...........

      ok, so i am still reading the laurie colwin book,......we are in 1968 when she dropped back into columbia just before the students for a democratic society (sds) staged a strike and took over the food service in which her apron read food/colwin.........at that time, her best friends name was reis (last name)....and the chapter is studded with reis this and reis that.............sounds very comforting.......columbis, and reis, and food, and laurie colwin..............

      ok, so it is nearly 6:00 pm on a friday evening, and i am home alone with no clue where everybody else is (except for ecw who is at work....) my mother picked up everybody else ages ago...who knows..........i have gone through the papers, and started in on a reread of an old favorite....laurie colwin's home cooking......laurie used to write regular columns in gourmet magazine until her untimely death in a traffic accident.......although her column ran 1 full year after the accident because she had turned in 12 columns at once just before her demise......she also writes/wrote novels.....i have 2 of them......anyway.....she writes like i think.........so it is a pleasure to reread her first book about cooking..........at the point where she recalled that she no longer keeps kosher, i was prompted to blog.........because this revelation about someone already dead and with god met with profound sadness.........if laurie colwin, who lived for food no longer kept kosher, then who IS still keeping kosher? .......as a sunday school teacher as well as a foodie, i am intrigued by the notion of foods deemed acceptable or unacceptable by god.......of course, in the new testament, peter has a vision that is interpreted as all foods being clean...so i do not feel obligated to be kosher...but still, it does my heart good to know that someone is still following the genesis and exodus and numbers rules for food.........as i understand it, Joe Lieberman keeps kosher.......i may have to vote for hime based on that quality along...though i would rather vote for either howard dean or wesley clark.....maybe they could form a triumverate...like in ancient rome..........clark could be pompey...........  ah well,..........today ms. dickey ate at trc, and took time to express her sadness that she will not be at dhs to teach scw in ap english next year.......she went on to say that she enjoyed having andrew, and sensed that neither he nor rowan appreciated praise in class, as it made them appear to be smart kids/nerds....a quality that both despised...........that is an observation that i have made myself.....that acw was never comfortable with his brilliance...........rather, he was embarassed by it........of course, now that his ap english exam score of 5 allowed him great latitude when it came to dropping calculus twice..........he may be glad that he paid attention at some point when english was being discussed at dhs........  back to laurie colwin, whose prose reminds me of a cozy blog.....she is someone that i wish i had met, and someone whose kitchen i regretfully have never seen.......well, i have seen it as it is mine.... neither of us have a food processor, or any other gadgets that require storage..........

      ok, so mm and ecw went to a party last night....3 doors down, at the shack in the bend in the circle......22 years we have lived here, and this was the first time we had ever been inside this particular place.......the new owners plan to tear it down and build again sometime next year........which is just as well now that we have seen it up close........they plan to reposition the house for better views of the creek and sunsets, etc.........one note of circle trivia.......their place is right on the wagon trail going into the creek bottom that we see going up out of the creek across from our house.......(when the lake was not here, wagons had to ford the creek ) .......they had a bonfire at the spot where the old trail meets the new lake.............we used to have bonfires with and without our neighbors when we were still cleaning up our property........it was always a cold weather event.........as the foilage had died down and the snakes were burrowed in for the winter..........anyway, we enjoyed the bonfire last night, except for the smoke........this morning my eyes are almost swollen shut and are red/itchy from the smoke.......my hair smells like smoke........my clothes on the closet floor smell like smoke.................ah well.........the price of a good time

      ok, so mm had to look up in the s-section of the dictionary for this title.........she has gone beyond her knowledge of s-words and is taking advantage of the websters..........but this is ok, because it might expand my meagre vocabulary.....anyway, salmonids are a family of fishes that include salmon and trout........we are having trout for supper, along with potatoes and creamed spinach and leftover sweet and sour red cabbage...............ooh, ooh..........i was unaware that trout and salmon were related at all....in fact, trout are sometimes called salmon trout...............now you know...........

      ok, so last night the c-w's finally rented chicago, the academyawardwinning musical......we had no idea what to expect, other than catherine zeta-jones performed well enough for a supporting actress oscar, and neither renee nor richard nor queen latifah managed the same feat.....my, but they could sing and dance...........i enjoyed those parts even though i didn't quite get whether they were really happening or imagined on everyone's part as the reality of the murder, incarceration, and trial played out.............regardless, i thought it was nicely done, and was pleased that it won best picture......this year i have hopes that best picture will be the return of the king, as a reward for the triliogy's outstanding everything.......cinematography, costumes, script, storyline, soundtrack,    casting ...............peter jackson's vision has been gloriously filmed.........the good news about this group of movies is that we know how it will end.............and this frees jackson to devote his time and talent to putting together a movie that plays that out, rather than figuring out where his movie is going and how it should end.....so many movies end pitifully...............i am so looking forward to watching sam gamgee throw the ring into the flames, and frodo defeating the spider, and the rest of the cast waging the war for middle earth.............so grand an epic deserves ultimate recognition............

      ok, so mm is running out of s-words...........she has also run out of sauvignon blanc and is forced to drink pinot grigio, though a very good bottle i must say.............we have just finished watching legally blonde 2:red, white and blonde............which we enjoyed (we being those over 40 and those under 11)..........the others left after a few moments.........but there is something about an insipiod feel-good movie......these folks had the saaavvvy to include a few clips from mr. smith goes to washington, which means that they realize that jimmy stewart and reese witherspoon have a lot in common......or reese wants to have a lot in common with jimmy .............and that is ok...we do need our buttondown, non-cutting edge people.......in the public eye.....those people who are NOT WEIRD, OR WIRED, OR PHYSICALLY DEFORMED..................i guess that elle woods is the anti-michael...and that is also good.........

      ok, so on the way home one day this week mm heard an interview with beth orton, a british folkie with a sultry voice.......of all the cuts to include on air, the producers chose the one i would most want to hear, her cover of ooh, child........a 60's piece that had been played at the end of a recent episode of alias.........the lyrics and the soulfulness of the song were perfect for the alias storyline.......and the 60's flashback was also welcome....i cannot connect myself to any particularly memory with this song, i only know that i remember it from the radio............anyway, it is recorded on her album called ________ ________Daybreak....i cannot quite remember the name, but daybreak is included in the album title and as a song.........it is in my head today, this song.................  Ooh Child  by  Five Stairsteps   Ooh-oo child  Things are gonna get easier  Ooh-oo child  Things'll get brighter  Ooh-oo child  Things are gonna get easier  Ooh-oo child  Things'll get brighter  Some day, yeah  We'll get it together and we'll get it all done  Some day When your head is much lighter  Some day, yeah  We'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun Some day When the world is much brighter  Ooh-oo child  Things are gonna be easier  Ooh-oo child  Things'll get be brighter  Ooh-oo child  Things are gonna be easier  Ooh-oo child  Things'll get be brighter  Some day, yeah  We'll get it together and we'll get it all done  Some day When your head is much lighter  Some day, yeah  We'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun Some day When the world is much brighter  Some day, yeah  We'll get it together and we'll get it all done  Some day When your head is much lighter  Some day, yeah  We'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun Some day When the world is much brighter  Ooh-oo child  Things are gonna get easier  Ooh-oo child  Things'll get brighter  Ooh-oo child  Things are gonna get easier  Ooh-oo child  Things'll get brighter  Right now, right now (you just wait and see how things are gonna be)

      ok, so mm needs to give kudos to her marvelous spouse who cleaned up after yesterday's dinner, as well as to the single child who helped clear the table..........when i say cleaned up i mean did the dishes and put things away....things like the silverplate that hides deep inside a cabinet, and the crystal waterglasses that also have an out of the way place to be between infreuqent uses..........i did not get out my grandmother's china, mostly because i do not like it and also because it did not 'go' with the tablecloth.....these are granny art deco/floral and mm prefers plain white plates that do not interfere with the food on them.........artistically or spiritually................i still have 12 water goblets presented by my mother when we got married, as well as 12 champagne flutes......and 12 sherbert/ice cream stems.......but only 3 wine goblets remain..............they were used much more often so the chance of breakage of increased dramatically............those who drink wine are much more likely to break the glass than people who drink water...........since our guests stayed only a short while, there was little of anything consumed yesterday..............the 3 wine goblets survived for another day................

      ok, so just before the guests came, serita figueroa, esq. a friend of ecw's mother called...to wish us well on thanksgiving...........now serita is quite a person, a lawyer from chile, who worked for chiquita banana out of cincinnati......she met my mother-in-law at a catholic senior citizen function of some sort, and they traveled some together........ecw's sisters always seemed somewhat jealous, and there was some talk of not inviting her to the wake after my mother-in-law's funeral....in fact, when i told my sister-in-law that serita had called, she laughed and asked 'what for?'  i was taken aback by that comment, as i always thought that she was a breath of fresh air on the scene......always trying to get my mother-in-law out of the house and into something interesting...............she once brought my mother-in-law to danville for the band festival, and they stayed with us for a few days..............to the last she was trying to get my mother-in-law to commit to a cruise of some sort..............it was this decisive nature that my spouse's family had a hard time accepting.........they were suspicious of it, which was laughable, as serita had education and income far above that of my mother-in-law.....but she saw in my mother-in-law the desire to see the world and experience more than the television set had to offer.....i was really happy to talk to her today...when she asked about recent trips, i told her about spain, and then about my upcoming trip to paris....she said ' you always liked paris the best'.......you have to love a woman who knows that paris is your favorite place..........i am not sure that my own family quite understands that.............

      ok, so ecw's sister lisa, and her husband, and her 3 children and her mother-in-law will be here for lunch in approximately 4.5 hours........i have yet to set up the table, or put away strewn magazines and books, but we are far from panic-time as i sit and blog..........they will stay only 3-4 hours, as they are on their way to ecw's brother james place near gatlinburg for the weekend...........brother james is in upstate ny at sister marilynn's house.................you get the picture........to my recollection, my brother has never been to ky for thanksgiving.............in my youth my family went to my grandmother's house in cleveland (of the million dollar houses........)......when i met up with my spouse-to-be i started to go to their thanksgiving in cincinnatti, which was held at either sister elaines or brother james or sister lisa's house......never at my mother-in-law's house...............we will have a bit of traditional fare from my side of the family.....relish tray that includes pickled beets, pickled onions, several kinds of pickled cucumbers and olives as well as our new southern fave- pickled okra.........the legacy of ecw's family to this year's thanksgiving?  the sweet and sour red cabbage and the creamed spinach.........i had never tasted either until i became a hyphenated weber............so i am glad that sister lisa is coming, even if for a short while.................thanksgiving is a family event, and i am grateful to have family, both the crowns and the webers...........

      ok, so this thanksgiving, mm is having sister schubert make the yeast rolls..........she does such a nice job, and mm is not in the mood........having already cooked most of thursday's dinner....i am down to the creamed spinach and the mashed potatoes at this point.........my goal is to lounge around in my jammies thursday morning, drinking coffee, reading the paper, and playing solitaire for awhile rather than cooking........about 11:00 am i will spring into action.....set the table, and warm up everything that i have previously prepared in the microwaves.........not like your grannie (greasy or otherwise) would have done it, but....................

      ok, so mm loved watching that cheesy show.......especially the romantic finale last night whereupon david picked linda rather than the evil caterina (cat), and though she initially rejected him because he lied to her about his money, she was waiting for him on his new 90 acre texas 'ranch'......of course, she pocketed $250,000 for accepting, but she does seem pure of heart, and david is so pure of heart as well..........i know, i know....it could be so cheesy, but i did so enjoy every cheesy minute of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      ok, so mm has finally figured out how to edit user profile (under the topic of how to keep your mamma from reading your blog......) i had the option of making up an alias, or inserting my initials rather than a last name.........just using my first name was not an option, for some reason...........now i will republish all of my archives to remove my last name.......

      ok, so last night we watched a video of the classic film, one that has been passed around book club since we discussed the book.........as a 60's film it is interesting that it was shot in black and white, rather than color........and the story is so compelling that i am surprised that no one has remade it as a blockbuster with an all-star cast...........i was in error when i looked up the oscars for the film.....without my glasses i did not see that gregory peck won for best actor in 1962 for this film, which also won for best director and best set decoration..........the little guy who played Dill was a hoot........... the actress who played Scout did ok, but she got on my nerves after a while.........

      ok, so mm had a good laugh when she read the newest new yorker....an ad for tiffany's elsa peretti sterling silver 3x handheld magnifying glass.......the price of $175 cannot be discerned by semi-blind people like me without their glasses on...........

      ok, so mm is not surprised about michael jackson's latest legal woes............anybody foolish enough to admit that they still sleep with little boys after paying out a financial settlement to a boy's family who cried molestation......is just plain stupid, or believes himself to be above the law......at this point it would be hard for a jury to separate m's crazy behavior from immoral behavior, because he crossed that line years ago.....cnn.com described his fan base as 'dwindling'...........i cannot imagine that he has any fans under the age of 25 or 30, who were young when thriller came out.......and the plastic surgury.........my gracious sakes......what has he done to himself........baby dangling? .............shopping frenzies followed by returns or lawsuit for nonpayment when the cameras are switched off.........sounds like m. has a whole lot of 'splaining' to do........

      ok, so mm's back feels so much better these days.....in fact, last night was the best night's sleep i have had in some time..........strange dreams, but a good sleep.............i am worried about my spouse.......who disclosed that he almost choked yesterday at work eating an english muffin with peanut butter without a glass of something to drink...his throat was a bit too dry, and a bite got caught, and he said that he was worried that the end was near...........this is scary stuff..............

      ok, so something has happened to our computor........the newer version of blogger is on my screen as we speak..........the version where i can read most of my last post without having to switch screens.........this has been a particularly confounding week, both at work and at home.........most of which isn't worth discussing............i do have a few bones to pick on certain issues......for starters, i was appauled to see a god-awful yellow humvee picking up a student at dhs this week.....a student who lives right across the street from bchs, by the way.....such an embrassment for the poor child......the ultimate in fuel-wasteful suv's in the worst possible color...whatever happened to buying a sporty bmw or mercedes as a way of bragging about disposabe income?............mm did not bother watching any of the heavily promoted interviews this week.......britney, tom cruise, jessica lynch......there is little they have to say that i care to hear about....i am sorry that i missed the special that dealt with the davinci code content......that would have been interesting.....mm is irritated that her sunday evening routine (alias at 9:00) has been pre-empted by yet another awards show.......i did get into watching the ohio state/purdue football game yesterday after work......i was overcome with memories of attending games with my dad in the horseshoe stadium.........osu/big ten footbal is an experience unlike any other..........i really missed him yesterday...luckily osu won despite looking quite amatuerish.....yeah.....college sports are supposed to be amatuerish, but they should not look quite so inept.........

      ok, so mm enjoyed a lovely, unexpected evening last night.....for starts....a couple of good friends were sharing a bottle of wine at trc as i was trying to sneak away about 5:45 pm......i joined them with the intention of staying for just a bit....then another couple arrived, and we changed to a bigger table, then it got to be 6:00 when the bike shop closes, so they called my spouse on a cell phone, and he joined us for a beer.....they ate supper while we sat and chatted........and we took home carryout, with the intention of sharing with our beloved live-at-home children.........but who should be at grandma's....but our darling college-age child.........grandma had ordered a pizza...so they brought the pizza back to our house, and we had basil-crusted veal chops, trout almondine, and a large papa john's as dinner choices.........after grandma went home we watched whale rider on dvd.......such a plesant evening...........

      ok, so mm enjoyed the onion article about your mamma finding out about your blog.......i would be horrified if my mamma read my blog, and yet i read scw's blog.............such a conundrum........  did mm mention that she is going to paris?     yes, for the 1th time......there are some places that deserve another look-see and paris is the ultimate place for a repeat visit........there will be three of us now, all of us wine-drinkers......which is a relief.....a long weekend with someone who was opposed to drinking would be dismal, to say the least............so now to devise the perfect itinterary......for the uniniated..mm lives to devise timeframes.......in that way i am like my dad, who planned out vacations down to the nanosecond......he hated to be late, and he wanted to know where he would be at any givien moment, so.........i was in paris with my dad for a few days in 1972....though not really out on the street with him, as he had broken his leg in switzerland, and he basically joined us for meals.......i recall seeing the louvre with my cousin nancy and my mother and brother, particularly the big iranian stone gates that are in the basement somewhere...as well as eating at a vietnamese restaurant with cellophane noodles.....i only remember my dad in the car, as my mother stopped the rental car somewhere near the arch of triumph....when my mother exclaimed that she was not driving 'another damn foot'.......there was complete silence in the car, as my mother does not swear.........but my dad could not drive, and i could not drive, and so my mother finally found the hotel,and got my dad up 6 flights of steps.................somewhere in france my dad and my cousin nancy debated about who should get the last order of 'brains'....i think my dad go them.....quite ironic for a man who would be senile by age 65........  i am printing out a list of  paris restaurants as we speak....ones with views, and i have neglected to cut and paste this list, which is wasting valuable printer's ink, according to those who are concerned about waste..........for that i am sorry..............

      ok, so mm was a bit nostalgic about paris today, veteran's day........one of my trips to paris was in november, and i went to a memorial service at notre dame on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.......it was put on by the british embassy, but no matter.........i reread the ending of the de vinci code last night, just to make sure i got it right before i reread the whole thing.......i can't wait to see the movie....which i hope is faithful to the story line.............again, mm is waiting inpatiently (impatiently?) for december 17........for the return fo the king.........just cannot wait........

      ok, so mm is still fixated on the da vinci code.........and cannot wait to see the paintings in question in the louvre...or the other paris sites mentioned..........i have had a back-flash that is relevant....i once went with my aunt and uncle in cleveland to an 'installation' of someone in a top-rank in eastern star...it was held in a church...and the place was packed, including the balconies...like this was some sort of big deal........it seems from this book that eastern star is the female version of the knights templar, which are centrally featured in this book as the guardians of the holy grail......who knew? my grandfather broughton was alo a mason....and the masons replaced the knights templar when the pope at the time inthe 1500's decided that the knights templar were too powerful, and accused them all of sodomy and had them basically burned out.........supposedly the knights templar were blackmailing the pope over their 'secret' and he was tired of paying........so many possibilities.......what is clear from this book, despite it's nature as a novel rather than non-fiction....is that it is entirely possible.....that jesus was married, just like all the other male jews of his age...and that he procreated....and that the line of jesus can be traced back................just like the c-w's to charlemagne....maybe we are also related to jesus..........nice thought, i suppose. to be related to a radically-thinking 1st century jew........anyway.....i may have to make a pilgrimage to see the original last supper fresco by davinci...also a centerpeice in this book.......to see the things i had not noticed before.............. in a world of predictable fiction, this book was a blessed releif......

      ok, so mm read the devinci code yesterday.......the entire book...because it really was a can't put it down thriller..........i even sat with it on my lap during supper, looking for the mannerly moment when i could commence to open it back up.......the premise is an interesting one........what if the holy grail was more than just the cup of christ...what if it were a person rather than a thing........and what if there were people who were pledged to protect this secret...for the past 2000 years.......and what a secret it turned out to be.........i can't wait to reread it to pick p what i missed the first go-round.........

      ok, so mm hears that the latest flack in d.c. over the recently signed/surely to be overturned abortion bill has to do with the signing photo-op......where gw was pictured signing, backed by white men in suits......no women, no ethnic minorities.....nobody except white males.........the image will be perfect for the opposition's fund raising...........'do you want your reproductive decisions to be made by white men in suits in washington?'.........which is kind of like ellen goodman's article today about the schiavo right to die case in fla........do you want jeb to make your end-of-life decisions?  her article made good points......a spouse is much more likely to choose her spouse over her parents to disclose her wishes on end-of-life matters, and choose this spouse to make these decisions when the time comes.........yes, the parents bore her, but when a child grows up and chooses a mate, the parental relationship is replaced by the spousal relationship......in fla, the shiavos cannot let go of their daughter, and desire to make decisions for her like she was still a child at home.........after the daughter's years of marriage prior to her accident, plus the 13 years in this vegetative state......they need to let her go......

      ok, so mm went to hear the jane austin talk last night at centre.......the jane austin's mafia talk, rather.........making connections between characters in emma with mafia 'text' in 4 media venues...the godfather, goodfellows, you have got mail, and the sopranos........relationship between emma and harriet was discussed as being similar to a godfather relationship......emma called the shots, but made it look like harriet made her own decisions.......also emma's relationship with her father, Mr. Woodhouse, was similar to tony sooprano's relationship with his uncle junior........emma is reallyn in charge, but makes it look like her father is in charge.......as does tony make it look like uncle junior is in charge.......both mr woodhouse and uncle junior are addled enough to think that they really are in charge......issues about manners in both the mafia 'text' and in austen's novels were pointed out..........as well as the knowing what should be done and will be done versus not knowing on the part of the players was observed........the you've got mail part revolved around quotes by the tom hanks character from the godfather, which other males in the movie understood but that were not understood by ryan.....conversely, ryan's jane austin references were meant to be understood only by women, yet hanks was familiar with them and used that preknowledge to his advantage.......ah well......i had a good time, despiute the fact that i could find no working water fountain in the rac.........

      ok, so mm has a potential co-traveler for early january to paris......paris is always a good place to go....the part i like about paris in this situation is the freedom to see things at leisure...i have been to paris 10 times.......three times with family on a schedule......3 times with school children, and 4 times with full-freedom but meager funding.........this time i will have meager funding but a more mature use for that funding...........i cannot wait.........

      ok, so mm finally broke down and sought medical treatment on day 7 of her illness.  her temperature in the doctor's office was 102, which meant that the dayquill had worn off......i am taking a z-pack of 3 antibioitic pills that will last 10 days...i had heard about those, but have never yet taken them before......lucky me...............the doctor recommended 2-3 days of bedrest, but i am going to work today for awhile anyway because i have to go.......

      ok, so mm is still sick, and feels so old with body aches and such...............i have to go to work today, but i will try to come home very early to go back to bed..........there is irony in a holiday illness.....i fantasized about doing nothing except lay about, and now that i have layed on the couch with fever and chills for hours on end, i feel like i have been robbed of my precious time..............i did watch pirates of carribean again...johnny depp was born to play a pirate..........real pirates would have been lucky to resemble johnny depp............

      ok, so mm is sitting at the new family computer, with features that i do not understand other than it is faster and has more storage than anything we could possibily need in the next week or two, when all computers become obsolete...........the techie from dell was able to transfer data....by taking out the harddrive and hooking it up to the new screen, rather than using a non-existent usb port........i did not mention the lack of windows 98 or usb port until he was done....turns out he is not supposed to transfer data in that manner, it is simply quicker use of his time and he is glad he was unaware that we had no usb at the time..................sweeet........now i can blog and listen to music...........the only fly int he ointment is the cd-rw/dvd drive which may not be able to make copiues of our video camera as it doesn't have dvd rewrite...............................but right non mm is having fever and chills, and will sign off until she is in her right mind......................

      ok, so we sat and watched the first part of the sound of music last night, despite the fact that we have watched it dozens of times before and we had no intention of staying up to watch it til it's conclusion.   we did debate the oscar wins for this fine film....for the record.......it won best picture and best director and best sound and a few other techie types, but lost for best actress and best supporting actress and best song.............julie andrews was robbed, i say.............earlier in the evening we watched u of l beat u of k..............such a sad game that started well and went to hell.....we did enjoy the short uk player from the bench named stockton.....he showed great grit for a guy 5 foot 9 inches........our new computer will be installed this afternoon............alas.......the data transfer will be brief, as our old computer has no usb port, and with windows 95 as its operating system cannot support a usb port..........at least according to my brother.........so all of my personal downloads are now stuck in scw's room......you never know...he may enjoy listening to guster sing mrs. robinson or sarah mchlauchlan and jewel singing closer to fine with the inigo girls.................

      ok, so our dinner discussion downgraded into whether sylvia plath went to vassar or smith, and i could not locate my weathered copy of the bell jar anywhere.............which led to a further discussion of another child's interest in selling off our excess books on ebay, and exactly what consititutes an excess book.......and most of us are unwilling to part with any books........mostly...i want to locate the bell jar...............

      ok, so mm has not actually gone to the doctor for a definitive diagnosis...i am simply operating under that assumption for self-treatment of my congestion and drainage......both the misery and the cure are annoying.......i feel dried up like a prune from the antihistamine and the other active ingredients create a dizziness that resembles an out-of-body experience...............the opened presents are slowly migrating from under the tree to bedrooms or have been added to the piles of dvd cases atop the television............the dvd storage problem will have to be solved soon, before the tv-top is full................we will have to move the vhs tapes out of the tv cabinet drawer into another location to make room for the dvd's..cayle has probably 'grown out' of most of the vhs tapes anyway..............yet another cleaning project for mm's time off in january..........add that to the ultimate project- the sorting and albuming of potographs from the past 3-4 years.............we now have a basket full of un-sorted photos.............all i need do is to divide them into cayle's album, scw's album, acws album and the family album.....i have continued individual albums for each child so that they can be taken to new homes at some future date, whilst still leaving a family album here at home...........sounded good for the first 15 years or so, but i have fallen behind..........

      ok, so mm slept in to the late hour of 7:55 am, and has lounged about in her jammies ever since....i may just continue to do nothing until i have to go to work today to help get supper ready...maybe about 1:30 pm or so........i could clean out some of the kitchen cupboards that have become mired in clutter......like the plastic container cupboard, where one can no longer find a lid that matches a bottom, or the lazy susan which has several partially used bags of powdered sugar, and no powdered sugar in the designated powdered sugar storage container...........i have already read as much of the paper as i care to read........maybe i will watch a movie...or maybe i will just go back to bed................the only problem with sloth is that it is such a waste of one's precious time.............

      ok, so even though i cannot really smell anything, nor taste anything, i have made myself sick eating my mother's shrimp spread on party rye bread........our refrigerator is still packed with much goodness......celeriac salad......pickled red cabbage.......honeybaked ham...........i can pass on the cookies and such that have been sent by or brought down the street, but shrimp spread really hits the spot...my dad once called it musty, as in 'i must have some more'.........trust me, it's flavor is not enhanced by a $6.99 bottle of sauvingnon blanc.............i have a pineapple kuchen in the oven.....it is a traditional breakfast pastry in our family...........and it is going on 9:00 at night....but i do not feel well, and the dough has been rising all day so i finally had to rise to the occassion and roll it out and bake it...........my grandmother would roll over in her grave to know that i left that dough in a bowl in the refrigerator all day........

      ok, so mm got up early, met the food delivery truck, put stock away, then drove to lexington for last-minute shopping..........by herself...........life is never so good as when one can be in stores for precisely as much time as desired.....and go to as many stores as one wishes........i bought some vintage clothing for myself and my family..........vintage is my new word for the goodwill, which sounds so declasse.....whereas vintage sounds hip and savvy........i remind myself at every visit that every dime i do not spend on full-price clothing can be diverted to travel.........anyway, i walked out with 4 bags of absolute treasures, then on to liqueur barn ,where i indulged in some nice sauvignon blanc to go with dinner tomorrow, as well as some spaetzle and pickled red cabbage and celeriac salad for supper tonight.......they go so well with roast pork.......then on to disc jockey, for the actual grail of the entire trip......a cat stevens cd that scw wanted to buy for his dad, but could not because he is so sick.........then to wild oats, where i purchased some of my spouse's favorite treats...........whole wheat fig bars, and dried figs from both turkey and california...his mother used to buy him dried figs as gifts.........then on to tuesday morning where i looked but did not buy, then to marshall's, where i spent too much money.......ah well........i did not make it back in time to attend the staff luncheon arranged by my partner at the very last minute.....by that time i had a fever, and could not breathe, and opted for a nap with a shot of nyquil.........it just doesn't get better than this...............

      ok, so my brother is in town for the week for christmas........it is so good to see him, as he has not come home for the past few years...opting to stay in d.c. and work instead.   now that dad is gone, i sense that he wants to make sure that we do not drift too far afield.  for starters, he has given the c-w family a new dell super-duper computer, with flat screen...yada, yada, yada..........we will be having a professional come to install it, and transfer 'data' which hopefully can include all of my favorite songs that are on the computer now in scw's room........anyway, last night my spouse actually took on my brother regarding a statement he made about education in america......that the fact the our daughter does not read well at age 10 is because of things that hillary clinton did in the 90's when bill was president......i was so proud of my spouse, who was like our wired hair terrier.....biting in and holding on for dear life........this exchange did not last too long, blessedly......but it was entertaining and revealing in the best sense.......i so love my husband, not only for his character, but also for his politics.................i could never be married to a conservative, or a republican...................

      ok, so mm lived through one of her biggest catering jobs of the year- a dinner/dance for 300 at the new convention center......the convention center is a very nice place......huge if left 'open', but convertible into smaller spaces with movable partitions......i do not think that 300 actually showed up, as there were lots of preplated salads and desserts left over........we have catered this party before, for fewer people.........at the convention center the task was made easier by the catering kitchen, to which a van laden with food may be backed up right to the door for unloading...........and the non-smoking status of the facility.............we have done this party at bright leaf in mercer county, which allows smoking..............the room was unventilated, and a cloud of smoke soon hovered over everyone after an hour or two of chainsmoking madness.....the convention center allows parties to bring in alcohol, and but does not allow people who step outside to smoke to bring their beer along......they even hired a security guard to make sure that this did not happen...........this group became incredibly trashed despite their alcohol-free smoke breaks.......i have not seen bottles of herve quervo passed around since my college days.........oh my.............i still have a few catering jobs before we close on wednesday evening for a few days, but nothing terribly complicated...............maybe now i can start christmas shopping............

      ok, so rotk was an amazing piece of cinema, in the true epic tradition.........i was glad to see the eowyn's role in the battle was spotlighted......the film was much longer than it had to be for the 'non-extended' version.........if i were queen of the world, instead of just this house, i would have transfered some of the slower or redundant parts to the extended-play dvd.....the conflict between sam, frodo and gollum was important to the story, but the sight of each trying to strangle the other became tiresome rather than enlightening......also....the reunion of the remaining fellowship in frodo's bedchamber was long when you add in the overly long parting scene at the elven ship....on the other hand, i was grateful that jackson boiled down the coronation and the reunion with arwen into one big scene........the book had too many trips back and forth..........overall, i was most impressed by the battle scenes...they were true to form- incredibly brutal and yet the bravery of those fighting was palpable........the touches that jackson added...like the trolls pushing the battlement storming towers, and the wildboar-shaped battering ram that glowed with fire.....really added to the overall effect.......i am not much for battle scenes, and i will confess to turning away several times......but they were well-done just the same.........and the special effects when the eye of sauron is extinguished and the land of mordor caves in.......whoooooooo.........that was much more impressive visually than it was in the book........i must give permenent record-credit to those who lasted through the marathon viewing of all three installments..........

      ok, so mm and unnamed family members (they appear to be publicity-shy) have scored 3 tickets to see rotk tonight at the danville cinema...for the total price of $5.....you read me correctly.........they were bought during the matinee time frame...........even though the tickets are for the 8:00 showing......sweet...........

      ok, so today would have been jane austin's birthday, were she hundreds of years old.........whenever life gets too crazy, i can always count on a video of a jane austin masterpiece to help me sort out the necessary and discard the chaff (sp?) we have taken on far too much work at trc.........and this doesn't even count a reception thursday for 175 and a dinner saturday for 300............we had 3 carryout lunches today before we even opened, and i was so far behind, thanks to my assistant who is yet out with his gallbladder.....that my food salesperson sliced turkey for me and broke down boxes while i made chicken salad, and pimento cheese, and sauce for the chicken special............now it is times like these, when time is of the essence, that jane austin speaks to me.....none of jane's heroines would have cried at such stressful moments.....so neither can i...........i just think about making it home finally to a glass or 3 of a nice white..............today was supposed to be the day when my nutrition 201 students turned in their take-home finals......i am still missing 9 tests......i have personally called each and every student asking about said tests...they have 24 hours to turn them in so i can register a grade by 1:00 am thursday morning..........one girl told me she thougth she had turned it in until she found it in her book bag while i was on the phone.......this is so humerous, as no professor i had in college would have called me to ask about any assignment let alone a final exam............but this is danville, and i am only mean to selected individuals...............

      ok, so mm is tiring of her all 's' month.......in january she will pick another letter.........i thought of calling this installment 'shit happens', as i just spent the past 45 minutes trying to string some 'swag' twinkle lights i found in the restaurant stockroom along our bushes out front.....only to have them short out the entire garage where i plugged them in......after figuring out how to reset the fuse box, the lights will not come back on.......the darkness has called me inside...the damned lights can wait til another day........maybe i will luck out and receive a chanukkah miracle of some sort...there is probably enough jewish blood flowing through my northern european body to qualify for some sort of holiday blessing...........so much for my holiday spirit...............which will be tested yet again this friday when my daughter's birth mother makes her annual visit..........i will be working through most of it, but the event is stressful on all involved..........luckily my brother will arrive from washington just after she leaves............now i want to talk of my upcoming trip to paris, which is growing more expensive with every dip in the dollar...the itinerary is as follows:Sat- January 10- arrive in paris, metro to Hotel Leveque (1 transfer) or shuttle....check-in if room is available; leave baggage if not...walk to Napolean's Tomb, then to Rodin Museum, then to Musee D'Orsay for lunch in grand ballroom(nice salad bar/buffet in grand surroundings); tour Musee D'Orsay; walk across river to L'Orangerie for a brief visit on our way back to hotel; Supper in hotel neighborhood; consider Chinese take-out place across the street from hotel. Sunday- January 11- breakfast at cafe in neighborhood; metro to Eglise St.  Sulpice for service and organ recital that follows Sunday service; metro to Louvre; lunch at Cafe Marly in courtyard by pyramid; tour Louvre and underground shopping plaza in Louvre complex; supper in hotel neighborhood or Nicole's for supper in Montmatre? Monday- January 12- breakfast in neighborhood; shopping on Left Bank- Bon Marche Tati, and Bon Point outlet if we can find it; drop bags back at hotel; lunch at Bookiniste in Seine; walk to St. Chapelle, then to Notre Dame; then to DeHillirin, the housewares mecca near Les Halles, ? metro to Sacre Coeuer and Nicole's for supper Tuesday- January 13- breakfast in neighborhood; metro to Champs Ellysee; shopping in area; lunch at Musee Jaquemart-Andre (in elegant room with frescoed ceiling-quiche, side salad and             dessert for 13 euro) tour museum; metro to Marais; walk around  Place des Vodges; look for secondhand silverware and dinnerware; metro back to neighborhood- supper near hotel Wednesday- January 14- taxi or shuttle to airport; fly home............ Hopefully this agenda will be challenging to those in my group who have been to paris before, and fulfilling to those who have not............gentle readers who have read the davinci code will notice some of my sangreal sites right away............

      ok, so mm watched snl last night....hosted by e. woods of lotr........several brilliant sketches....the one with dubya was the best.......he is shown speaking to the troups, dressed like he is in the army, then addressing the elderly sick in a hospital gown while dragging an iv pole, then addressing environmentalists dressed as a tree, on and on, then finally addressing a church group dressed as jesus christ.....that was pretty funny......even funnier of dubya takes the bait and actually does dress up as jesus christ.......his ego seems large enough to encompass himself as diety......the musical guest, jet, reminded me of 80's bands.....kind of like cheap trick or something similar.....quite retro.....like they could launch into highway to hell at any moment.....woods was not particularly funny, though the sketch they did about the new sitcom starring frodo and gollum as two crazy guys who move to denver and live in a quaint apartment building was humorous.......the countdown to return of the king is making me crazy.....i want to see it now, not wednesday........assuming we can get tickets on wednesday, or even thursday..................  in other news, mm has renegoiated her cellular contract, added another family talk line, and obtained gsm phones with nationwide long distance......at a lower rate than she was paying before...........the cell companies must be in a price/services war, as it is now cheaper for us to use our cell phones to call long distance than it is to use our home phone..................and all of the features are included, not extra...........ironically we have rollover.....and we are not talkers.......i wonder if there is a limit to our minutes.......maybe we will have quite a cushion by the time scw goes to college...............

      ok, so mm and her kin have just watched the entire extended version of lotr/the two towers.........hours and hours of extra footage( or it just seemed so) with many moments that we could not believe were left out............of course.....the extended version is so long that the theatres could have only one sitting an evening, unless they did an all-nighter of some kind for the stalwart fans........speaking of fans...at the end of the extended version of the two towers, the producers thanked all of the charter members of the lotr fan club............endless names in alphabetical order....i gave up and quit watching after it was clear that there were many crowleys but no crowns or c-w's................i cannot wait to see the final installment of this marvelous epic...........

      ok, so it is days like this...dreary, cold,endless......that i think that i may have been mistaken in taking up residence in the northern south rather than the southern south...for the record...anything south of the mason dixon line and/or the ohio river is south........not that i have spent many pleasant hours in the southern south......i can remember one extra cold february when i was in orlando for a diabetes workshop,  in a coldsnap, in an unheated hotel room, sleeping with my trenchcoat over the bedspread for an extra layer of warmth...............2 years ago when we went to northern europe in a coldsnap, i was prepared..........pajamas, extra blanket, socks......but in fla. i expected warmth.....on the other hand, i have known people who went further south looking for heat, and found food poisoning instead........a 4 day weekend in cancun with intestinal distress is not my idea of a vacation...however,if i concentrate, i can recall a spring break...maybe 1977.....when i went to clearwater beach with cindy wildman, and we played backgammon on the beach for 7 solid days, and got terribly sunburnt, and did not go out with creepy-looking types who claimed that they played baseball for the reds farm team........i could handle a bit of that warm, laying on the beach in a 2-piece that fit kind of experience right now.....with someone who likes to play backgammon...........

      ok, so mm anticipates the opening of the girl with the pearl earring, a new movie with scarlett johannson and colin firth...............it will open in our neck of the woods sometime in january 2004.......even though it opens in nyc this weekend.....yet another reason to live in nyc...........i read this book 2 years ago, prior to our trip to northern europe, which included amsterdam...i actually saw this picture in the hague in 1976, when i was traveling with my parents and we went to the art museum in the hague, with the name i cannot pronounce..........anyway.........the book is stellar, with a luminescence (sp) that is palpable.........i can picture scarlett johannson in this role, though i thought she was wasted in lost in translation........i am a colin firth fan, of course, given that i have watched pride and prejudice on vhs...all 6 installments........at least 12 times.........i went to the authors web site.......to read what she has to say about her book turned movie.........the bottomline.......she sold the rights before the book hit it big.....which is  means that she got next to nothing for a film that will be both visually beautiful and emotionally stirring.......the book is about passion that goes beyond the casual sex pandered in most films........it is about an artist who understood true beauty, and about the girl/scullery maid he chanced to paint  who understood  art/lighting/texture/placement/color etc........the result is a compelling study in both innocence and guile.....like mona lisa with a turban..........there is a chance that i could see the movie in paris, as it may hit that market before it makes it to the kentucky....alas, this is not a movie that will play danville............

      ok, so mm lasted til monday without public blogging.................but she must lament that a) she does not live in nyc  and b) she did not have tickets to see the simon and garfunkel concerts staged there last week, that were easily accessible to those who live in nyc.............an older new yorker issue, perched on the bathtub, is open to the ad for the concert, the reunion cd boxed set, and the entire s&g catalog, just in case anyone wanted to delight a loved one with the entire s&g recorded works................i would like to hear them in concert, however......their sound and their lyrics go through my brain from time to time.............at least i can understand them when they sing..............paul simon's wife, natalie merchant, has a lovely voice, but i cannot make out much that she sings...............must be my early-onset deafness/general agedness...................

"As a Christian, a trained engineer and scientist, and a professor at Emory University, I am embarrassed by Superintendent Kathy Cox's attempt to censor and distort the education of Georgia's students," Carter said in a written statement. ......................the christian right is such a scary bunch............to alter education to fit their narrow understanding of the world...............so frightening that people like this can make it to places of power, and enjoy control over what students read to that extent.........

      ok, so we, who send our children to integrated, 'inner-city' schools already knew this.............  Report: Suburban schools not safe havens From sex to drugs, similar student behaviors in cities, suburbs Thursday, January 29, 2004 Posted: 10:46 AM EST            WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who flee urban schools in pursuit of more wholesome settings may be surprised by this report card: Suburban students engage in just as much sex, drugs and fighting as city kids do.   "The desks may be newer, the paint may be fresher and the faces may be whiter, but the students are just as likely to have sex, use controlled substances and break the law," says the report released Wednesday by The Manhattan Institute, a New York-based conservative think tank.   Authors Jay Greene and Greg Forster analyzed student survey data collected from the same group of students in three waves, from 1995 to 2002. The survey, which included an estimated 20,000 students, was sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and other federal agencies.   Among the results of the study, which focused on high school grades:   -- Two-thirds of suburban and urban 12th-graders have had sex; 43 percent of suburban 12th-graders and 39 percent of urban 12th-graders have had sex outside of a "romantic relationship."   -- 74 percent of suburban 12th-graders and 71 percent of urban 12th-graders have tried alcohol more than two or three times.   -- 22 percent of suburban 12th-graders and 16 percent of urban 12th-graders say they have driven while drunk.   -- More than 40 percent of 12th-graders in urban and suburban schools have used illegal drugs.   -- 20 percent of urban 12th-grade girls have been pregnant; 14 percent of suburban 12th-grade girls have. Such numbers are among those that are higher than many people would likely expect, regardless of the school setting, Greene said.   "People who think they've escaped these kinds of societal issues by moving to the suburbs -- we think they're mistaken," Greene said. "The suburban schools aren't safe havens."

      ok, so today is the birthday of colette, my favorite author.......the following is from the writer's almanac via minnesota public radio's web site..............It's the birthday of (Sidonie Gabrielle) Colette, born in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, France (1873). At the age of 20, she married an older man, a writer and critic who employed a number of ghostwriters. He convinced Colette to write down stories about her childhood and embellish them with juicy details. When she did, he published them in his name as Claudine at School (1900), the first novel in the Claudine series, about an outspoken, clever young woman who discovers a love affair between a headmistress and a young female teacher. Colette's early writing was forced labor: her husband locked her in a room until she had produced enough pages for the day, and he kept the royalties. After fleeing her husband in 1906, Colette became a Parisian music-hall performer famous for baring one breast while dancing. At the Moulin Rouge, she caused even more controversy when she took a woman into a passionate embrace. The show caused a riot. The curtain had to be brought down early, and Colette became the talk of the town.   Colette began to write at least one book a year, producing more than 80 volumes, including Ch?ri (1920), My Mother's House (1922) and Sido (1930). Proust admired her, and wrote to her to say that her novella Mitsou (1930), about a music-hall artist who falls in love with an officer on leave, had moved him to tears. She kept up to two dozen cats in her house, and her novel La Chatte (The Cat, 1933) deals with a kind of love triangle between a man, a woman and a cat. In 1944, at the age of 72, she published Gigi, about a spontaneous young girl who is trained by courtesans in "the honorable habits of women without honor." It was adapted for the theater in 1951, with a young Audrey Hepburn in the title role, and later made into a movie.   When she died in 1954 Colette was denied a Catholic funeral, but thousands attended the state funeral provided by the French government?the first for a woman. A plaque on her house in Paris reads, "Here lived, here died Colette, whose work is a window wide open on life."   Colette said, 'sit down and put down everything that comes into your head and then you're a writer. But an author is one who can judge his own stuff's worth, without pity, and destroy most of it."   And she said, "The lovesick, the betrayed, and the jealous all smell alike," and "What a wonderful life I've had! I only wish I'd realized it sooner."   In the short story chance aquaintances, colette recalls a vacation trip that she took to a rented mountain 'villa' along with her cat, that ended up with a stay of several weeks at a spa..........there is a touching paragraph that i will type in long-hand..............'the striped cat was called Peronella at first, then Prrou. You'll find the two names in my earlier novels; but these names fall to shreds on her like second-rate clothing.  She became an unclassifiable, private-edition cat, and as is universally known- cats with strong personalities need no names.  She was called "Come Here", she was called "where have you got to?".......and "lets be off...." not to mention fancy names, invented at moments of enthusiasm or tenderness, such as "light of the mountainside', or 'o striped to the utmost of stripeability' ....'birdcat'...and so on.  No one made much of a fuss of her, not even me...She was never called on by reporters, and she granted no interviews.  We lived together. When i had to leave her behind with my mother during a long absence, the striped cat took it into her head to die, and she died.  If i mention her in this tale now and again, it is not because I want to give her any special promenance in it, but because she was a part of my life........'  I have read and reread this piece numerous times, and it always brings me to the brink of tears...how Colette can describe her life and aquaintances in such a poignant manner....even down to her cat.....which she probably missed more than many/any of her husbands.......

      ok, so mm recieved an actual complement today.......regarding her choice of literature at the advanced age pf 47...............'at least you read colette and not romance novels..........'there was a bit of exchange about whether colette was, in fact, a romance author..............gentle readers, madame colette was the first woman to receive a medal from the academie francaise......when she died she was afforded a state funeral..............she was lightyears beyond a romance novelist....................like the kind sold in walmart checkouts................colette was a woman of letters............a woman of ideas, of action, of passion, of substance.........to read colette is to read one's own blog.................or so i told my middle child this very day.....colette's blog would surely have sounded like mine....................or so I tell myself in my lowest moments..........

      ok, so today is the birthday of robert burns, somerset maugham, and virginia woolf.......i am quite unfamiliar with anything written by burns short of auld lang syne......the same with maugham......but woolf.....her piece...a room fo one's own.......is quite wonderful, especially for any woman who has a hankering to write...or blog......i am not sure that the little computer room counts as a room of one's own, as it must be shared.....but only one can sit in here at a time so there is an element of privacy...........woolf suffered greatly from bouts of depression.......a quote from virginia   'on the outskirts of every agony sits some observant fellow who points'.......i am not sure what it means but i like how it sounds.......her father published a dictionary, and encouraged his daughter to read widely......he advised her, in so many words...to read what she liked no matter if anybody else liked it, and to refrain from praising books that she did not like........there is great wisdom in those parental words.......i have read  to the lighthouse  numerous times, finding greater depth each and every time i pick it up.......her stream of consciousness must mesh with the way my own brain rambles......

      ok, so mm reaches for her colette shelf when she is tired, frustrated, and in need of familiar literature............tonight i reread gigi, a short story made famous by hollywood, maurice chevalier (thank heavens for little girls......) and audrey hepburn.........reading it as a short story reminds me of how little it takes for hollywood to make a bit of dialogue into a major motion picture..............and after seeing cold mountain, it is difficult to see the connection between this short story and a major motion picture of any depth....................even if it took place in paris...............will cold mountain be the new barometer of substance, worth, etc.?????????and this after 3 years of lotr releases???????????????too much cinematic genius in too little time......................but back to madame colette.....her short story is spare on length, but rich in substance, detail, and believability...............and it lacks gory battle scenes............ maybe i will reread my entire colette shelf...and will feel a little better about the world than i do at this very moment..............

      ok, so my best guy and i went to the 4:00 showing of cold mountain.....we had both read the book some time ago......maybe several years ago......and were not quite clear on the particulars...but we did remember, at the end.....how the book ended.....and we were still stunned that the movie portrayed the tragic ending moreso than the book......that is really the bottom line about this movie.....it was better than the book...........visually beautiful......horrific beyond hell..........there were parts that i could not watch...and as my eyes were averted i pondered the realization that the civil war, like all wars, was certainly worse than what i saw in snatches on the screen.......and that strong women were the reason that the south survived the war, and the years after the war.............and oh, what i would not give to look and act like nicole kidman.....she will surely have the last laugh on the tom cruise divorce.....he will fade away, and she will bloom as one of cinema's brightest talents.............in this film, she is breathtaking............even in the worst moments..............and then there is jude law as inman........who falls instantly for ada (nicole) ..........and spends the bulk of the movie getting back to her................oh, my.......and then there is renee zellweger and jack white.....he of the white stripes........they add so much to this film..........it is so fitting that one hears that they are an item........gentle readers......mm is in a conumdrum (a latin term spoken in a critical part of the movie, by the way....) whilst she was blown away by this film.....she really wants lotr/rotk to not only be nominated for an oscar, but also receive said oscar for best picture based on general merit for the entire trilogy........................on the other hand....cold mountain is so true to the book, so emotionally draining, so cinematically perfect....................oh my.....................

      ok, so mm is so glad that it is friday, even though she will work part of saturday...............i catered a dinner at my own church this evening.......and was glad of it......for the record, my church was kicked out of the southern baptist convention for having a female minister and female deacons.....the group that met at my church tonight is of the same ilk.....all are fed up with conservative christians who seek to co-opt the church............i was glad to be a part of such a gathering..............

      ok, so mm accompanied her precious spouse to the annual chamber of commerce awards dinner......he won the first ever ethics in business award...for which i am so proud..........after the event was finally over, and the pictures were over......and ch' crowley's mother told me about how well the boy in the hat did on the psat.....then there was the after-party..........where alice f.k., was politicking with those in attendence............she who is running for congress.....well......i could not turn down the opportunity for mm to speak her mind.....and luckily i had not had anything short of water.............for i was quite cordial when i introduced myself......and certianly upbeat when i complemented her on her positive campaign.....but then i scowled, and told her that i had been quite dismayed over the weekend when her ad came on the tv, and hillary r. clinton's head popped up as some symbol of evil.........i said...'i was so disappointed that you would go that low......."......she quickly countered that it was not her ad....that it was sponsored by the republican national hoo-ha committee...........and started to turn her head and introduce herself to my ethical spouse, who would never had said these things to her.............having thought about my encounter.......for and hour or two........i wish i had introduced myself as a lifelong democrat who was almost ready to vote for her as a qualified woman, until her financial backers screwed up..........ah well.........mm spoke her mind......................

      ok, so mm has decided that a mother/son/mother/daughter trip to florence next january would be quite nice.......especially if one of the mothers spoke italian and one of the children knew her art......the mm is having major travel withdrawal, and needs to come up with a pallative itinerary on which to ponder/plan/ and otherwise daydream upon.......i am well aware that the boy with the hat does not care if he sees rick steves on this trip, or if we even consult rick steve's florence book at all......but i must say that i missed traveling with the 'young people' this go-around..........scheduling could work out even if one of the young people involved goes to school next year in mass.........anyway.....something to ponder...........

      ok, so mm had saturday off, and planned to do as little as possible.......except that is not possible so what follows is a synopsis of what i did when i did not plan to do anything.........drove to town and took in 3 rolls of film...2 from paris and 1 that i found whilst packing for paris......who knows where or when it was taken........rented 3 dvds, then bought plastic string-closure folders so that i can reorganize all of my eku class notes, overheads, etc.......bought 15, as well as more overheads, copy paper.........went to krogers and bought stuff to make lasagna for us sunday as well as a small one to take to a neighbor who is ill.........stopped by taco bell to buy lunch for me and the children who chose not to accompany me to town.........made the lasagnas, then decided that today was the day that i would organize all of those photographs from the past 3-4 years.....could not find the empty albums that i bought 2-3 years ago.........gave up and decided to watch dvds while i organized eku stuff.........watched catch me if you can, with leo and tom hanks...the wearing the hat downtown boy commented that leo only plays people who are imposters of somebdy else..........then watched matt damon in the bourne idendity..........which was a great flick that mostly happens in paris..................watched it again with mostly everybody else after supper...............ripped apart the baby sweater that required a little more yarn......reworked the sleeves a tad smaller to allow enough yarn to make the button band.......got into an argument with my mother prior to supper about the term ms......which my mother considers an afront to all she holds dear.......i told her that i have been a proud ms for 23 years, and consider the term an honorable description of a woman is in a partnership, not owned by a spouse......talk about waving the red flag....enough of a full and satisfying day when i had planned to do absolutely nothing...............

      ok, so mm finally got to watch sunday's episode of alias that her children dutifully taped for her (many thanks....)  this episode clears up all of the questions about what happened to syd during the 2 years she was gone.......we discover that syd had her own mind erased so that she could not tell anybody where she hid the cube containing rimbaldi's dna.......but that sloan tricked her into finding the cube in the last episode........we find out why lazarey's hand was in the box in the desert, and why syd has the scar on her abdomen.......the covenant believes that syd is the chosen one, who will give birth to rimbaldi's heir, at  least her eggs will be involved.............but at the end syd tracks down sark, who has the dna, and is working with lab guys to do test tube fertilizations using syd's eggs........lazarey is there, too, as he is sark's father.....keeping up so far, gentle readers?..........sydney torches the place, but sark gets away.......sydney brings lazarey, who has been wounded in the gunfight at the makeshift lab....back to l.a.............he tries to tell her something about a 'passenger', but she tells him they will have time to talk later..........a sniper shoots lazarey as he is being wheeled into a naval hospital.........we get a good look at the sniper as the episode ends.....lauren......vaughan's wife.........now we always knew that lauren was evil.....and now we have proof........so what is her end game....does she really love vaughan, or was that a set-up for something even extra evil that will happen later in the season?.........so many routes that the show can take now.......and they all will lead somehow to sloan, who syd now knows has some connection to her 2-year disappearance.......and of course, where is syd's mother, irena........???????oh, my......2 more days until the next episode of alias.........

      ok, so here is what mm wrote on the rick steves grafitti board about the trip..... I have just returned from a whirlwind trip to Paris, a sort of theme trip with several ladies from my Sunday School class....we read the DaVinci Code over the holidays, and decided to visit the Parisian sites that were key to the story line...more on that later......I planned several lunches at restaurants on-site at major museums. The first day, we lunched in the incredible dining room at Musee D'Orsay.....This room must have been either a dining room or a ballroom when the D'Orsay was a hotel/railroad station.....the ceiling and walls are quite elegant, and diners relax in huge wicker armchairs...we each had either a hot plat du jour or a salad plate...mine was a 'salad of the forest' with mixed greens, mushrooms, roast duck and duck confit, with a broiled goat cheese toast garnish.....the price for 3, including a carafe of house white was 46.55 euros....quite a bargain for the ambience and the luscious food.....Another day we lunched in yet another outstanding dining room, this time in the Musee Jaquemart-Andre, on Blvd Haussmann..the ceiling was brought back from Italy by the art-collector couple that built the house, and the room had those 20 foot walls that make an Italian-painted ceiling seem perfect.....my salad plate was again mixed greens, this time covered in thinly sliced Italian ham, along with grape tomatoes, 3 broiled goat cheese toasts, and a little sauce dish of black olive tapenade.......just divine with a bottle of a mighty dry reisling....for 3...50.05 euros including several cafe cremes.....another deal for ladies who wanted to really 'do' lunch....if you go, get there before 11:30 am, as the room filled up quickly and they take no reservations......now for the most memorable part of the trip.....the DaVinci Code part.....which took place at St. Sulpice....we opted to take Rick Steve's advice, and go to Sunday 10:30 am mass, then stay for the organ concert and wait at the door at the left of the entrance in case the organist will allow visitors to the organ loft.......we were the very last to go up the steps, and stopped to take a few pictures of the sanctuary from the balcony before making our way down the dimly lit hall toward the organ loft.....we were ushered into a brilliant red silk-lined reception room....and as the door closed on the small gathering of tourists, we heard someone gasp....aren't you Rick Steves?.......there he was, confirming details of the organ recital section of the 2004 Paris book with organist Daniel Roth.......Rick Steves himself......We had our pictures taken with him, as well as with the organist. I got his autograph in my little moleskine travel diary.......talk about being in the right place at the right time.....Our next stop was the Louvre, to see the Mona Lisa and Madonna of the Rocks, as well as the inverted pyramid.....also key elements in the book....but not before we lunched at Cafe Marly, in the Richelieu Wing, overlooking the pyramid entrance. We had read that reservations were not required.....The staff had a bit of an attitude because of our lack of reservations but condecended to seat us within 8-10 minutes anyway.......we dined in a glowing room overlooking the Marly horses...the walls had a treatment that resembled baby blue suede, and we sat on burgundy couches or blue velvet chairs...just lovely....the prices were more than we had anticipated...but the food was purely divine.....I had a Thai shrimp soup with lemongrass and mushrooms in a broth thickened with coconut milk and a glass or two of a nice sancerre for about 20 euros.....worth the price just for the people-watching alone......this place must be where the interesting come to see and be seen.....we did toast to Rick Steves, by the way......for making our short winter Paris getaway so memorable......I should add, for the record....that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Leveque on the Rue Cler, and the meals (2) that we had with Phillippe at La Varangue, and at L'Auberge de Champs de Mars, and the Chinese take-out place across from the hotel. By the way, there is a cyber-cafe just down from L'Auberge de Champs de Mars that is open 12 noon to 8 or 10 depending on the day of the week. Despite the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, we felt completely secure, and had absolutely no trouble getting along with any one as long as we smiled broadly, and spoke broken French with Kentucky accents.....A wonderful trip.

      ok, so mm has been up since 11:00 pm ky time trying to get home again.......one of my traveling companions decided that getting up at 6:00 am french time for a 7:15 shuttle may not be enough time, so she got up at 5:00 am instead.......which meant that the rest of us woke up at 5:00 am and tried to keep our eyes shut until 6:00 am, by which time our friend was dressed, and packed and standing by the door......she finally decided to go and sit in the lobby by herself..........and wait for us to finally come down......our shuttle meandered through the darkened streets of paris picking up 5 more passengers.....4 from philedelphia who we are convinced got off at the domestic air france terminal rather than the international one........hopefully they made it back home.........we had no line when we checked in with our delta/air france code share flight........................we were grateful for the level of scrutiny at the security checkpoint...travelers to washington dc and l.a. went through a separate line altogther..............there were bomb-sniffing dogs,too.......we met a man in the line getting onto the air france shuttle (we had to travel a great distance to our plane, which was parked in the back-forty.......) he is a philosphy professor from eku, originally from nigeria.....who also missed his first classes because he goes home for a few weeks every christmas..................the air france flight was delightful.......individual movie screens and control wands.......we could choose from 6 movies.........i watched je reste, with sophie morceau, the quiet american with brendan frazier and michael caine, and white oleander............i could have watched a 4th movie, but i fell into the on-screen solitaire...........and all of a sudden we were landing in cincinnati and i hadn't even taken a nap.............i am so ready to sleep in my own bed, with my own spouse.....when he gets up at 5:00 am to go run, i have learned to ignore him and go bacl to sleep.........there is no place like home...........

      ok, so mm spent sunday on cloud nine.........we had a leisurely breakfast of ham and cheese omelets at the corner cafe, then metroed to st. sulpice, the church featured in the davinci code.......we arrived at the end of mass, intending to hear the 30 minute organ concert that was highlighted in rick steves paris book as something not to miss.   we walked around the church during the concert, looking for the rose line, to no avail.....then gathered with the group at the small door to the left of the entrance that opens after the concert is over...to allow the interested to go up and see the actual organ in the loft.......we were at the end of the line, climbing cramped circular steps.........and were quickly ushered into a lovely red-walled room with glass doors, where we were to meet the organist, a daniel roth..........and there he was....rick steves in the flesh.......asking mr. roth if the information in the 2004 book was correct so that he could include it in the 2005 book..................we got his autograph, and had our pictures made with him........we were like travel writer groupies.....mr steves insisted that the organist be included in autographs and photos..........we spent some time talking to the french guide, who said that she was hired by mr. steves to take him around.....and we talked more later with mr steves about danville, and the vice-presidential debate...of all things........he noticed that my travel book for this trip was by moleskine.......and was amused that i had copied his maps and taped them inside.........what an incredible coincidence......................later we dragged oursleves to cafe marly at the louvre pyramid for an expensive little brunch, then toured the louvre highlights until we were due in montmarte to have supper with nicole rufflet.........today we shopped at bon marche and bought cool groceries....then did scoured the bookstores for dossiers......so far we have 11 of the books requested......no laye or dubellay so far...it is like nobody has heard of them......will blog again tomorrow before coming home........

      ok, so mm has arrived in paris, after a turbulent night of crying babies and bumpy patches....and grateful to be here......we had a glitch at lex/bluegrass airport, whereupon one of my travel companians did not have her paper ticket, through a travel agent error....she thought she had an e-ticket...anyway, after 45 minutes of negotiating she was resissued a ticket and we got on the plane...many thanks to eric hall, delta employee........shuttle to hotel leveque on rue cler......rue cler is charming, the hotel is charming....a market street....our window boxes (2) have blooming cyclamen in them...so festive and quaint..........we walked to musee de l'armee to see napoelan's tomb and to buy museum pass, then on to rodin museum and then to musee d'orsay...we had lunch in main dining room of museum...the old train station/hotel dining room...lovely meal of a salade forestiere with mixed greens, chevre, mushrooms, tomatoes, and duck slices.......along with a glass of dry white...lovely.......we enjoyed the paintings, then walked back to the hotel for a little nap before dinner........the weather is quite fine...a few sprinkles with temps around 55 degrees......tomorrow...st. sulpice for mass and to hear the organ concert, then cafe marly and the louvre....we will haver supper with nicole rufflet in montmartre later on........for those who i forgot to tell, sorry...my hotel is grand hotel leveque, 01 47 05 49 15.....a bientot

      ok, so mm is just about ready to roll on this extended weekend trip to paris..........just need to throw the rest in my carryon...........the suitcase is eerily empty by comparison to other trips.....so i have either learned a few things over the years, the suitcase is too big, or i will be seriously underdressed......i have entertained myself by copying useful french lines in my little travel book just in case........just in case i do not want to get out my little phrase book........i am hoping that 25 years of trying to learn french will bloom into a 4-day bout of basic yet adequate transactions with people in museums, stores and restaurants.......one disappointment to report....i have worked feverishly to finish a baby sweater for niece nicole's new baby coner (conner?) crowley.....on the last sleeve i ran out of yarn about 5 yards too soon........this means that i will have to take apart both sleeves and make them slightly smaller....when i come back....unless some kind family member does this for me......(meaning my mother.....) ah well...........wish me luck and a safe journey.....i will blog from paris if a cybercafe presents itself.......and believe me.......i will toast my gentle readers at the first available moment if my plane lands safely

      ok, so mm has made a big mistake, and needs some mea culpa time from her gentle readers.................here goes......when i booked my little 4 day jaunt to paris, i neglected to compare the dates to my eku class at danville manor.........i will return about 24 hours after my first class should have met......so..............i changed the syllabus to reflect no class on the first day, mailed 45 copies to students i have not even met, and sent the syllabus into the eku main office along with my contract........i thought everything was taken care of until i had a call from the department chair this morning.....she was concerned that my class may not have enough contact hours, and requested that i find subs for the first class as well as for danville spring break........she also questioned my habit of having a class for each chapter in the nutrition book (14), which allowed for there to be a few fewer classes than the sememster would have required (15) in the first place........i called out to the eku danville director, who assured me that i was talking to a department chair who is preparing for an accreditation inspection in 2007........and who also assured me that she was not concerned that the danville students were being shortchanged.with regards to clcok hours............the danville campus people basically told me to resubmit a revised syllabus to eku main campus, and then do what i wanted at the manor.............i feel much better..............

      ok, so mm has not shown her usual pre-trip euphoria..............which i atrribute to my general malaise these past 2 weeks.......i have drifted into an unknown territory during my illness and now my vacation.....a vacuous-state in which i do not get dressed until noon, and venture out only to pick up my children..........i do not ever recall having the time or the inclination for such laziness..........even in my worst days of sloth in college...therefore i believe that the behavior persists because i have nothing else to do until i leave on friday......putting photos in albums not withstanding.........whereupon i will leap into action on all of the travel itinerary plans made thus far..............

      ok, so mm has an opinion on pete rose.....gentle readers are requested to kindly allow mm to rant.......for starts, i am no fan of organized baseball, football, basketball, hockey, etc.....the only sporting events that i can be counted on to watch include wimbledon tennis, the osu-michigan game, march madness if ky is playing, and the world series if i have any inkling that i have a connection to the teams (like sympathy for the boston red sox....or chicago cubs) anyway,  i lived in cincinnati from 1978 through 1981 or so.......during the time when pete rose either played or managed/played or was disgraced or all three.........those were sad times for baseball fans, especially reds fans.........the question remains as to whether a player's personal life should weigh heavier than a player's contribution to the game of baseball when it comes to hall of fame status...........this is one of the few times that i can recall my grandpa broughton's opinion on any subject.........he laughed and recalled seeing ty cobb playing in indians stadium in cleveland......he recalled that ty cobb was notorius for keeping a bottle of bourbon with him the dugout, and that he was therefore apt to be involved in benchclearing brawls..............grandpa commented......'now ty cobb...he was no angel, and he is in the hall of fame............'that is the bottom line........there are those who are already in the hall of fame who are no angels...with regards to drink, drugs, wife abuse/adultery, tax evation, gluttony, you name the deadly sin..........if we draw the line and say........you can be elected to the hall of fame having commited any sin except gambling on baseball, it makes the whole hall of fame outfit look stupid........election to the hall of fame should be based only on contribution to the game of baseball, without moral judgements attached.......pete rose meets that pure concept of hall of fame.............lets get on with the business of electing him with next year's ballot............

      ok, so mm has procrastinated for weeks about making a reservation for monday at the seine-side bistro called les bookiniste (sp)......with the fall in the dollar, i hesitated to spend 35 euro for lunch........well, we now seem to have 2 reservations for this restaurant......one for 3 persons, and one for 4 persons, made by cynthia's friend nicole.....i have started to pack my stuff...at least started to get my stuff together and started to contemplate which suitcase i will use, how many layers of clothing will keep me warm, etc........my cough has returned.......alas.........i also need to shop for cold/sinus remedies just in case as i do not know the french words that describe those miseries......i have so few days off before i go to france and before i go back to work.....i may just delay this packing business a bit longer and go back to bed..............

      ok, so mm is still not herself...............but enough so to report that the rest of her relations are just crazy............let's start with the ones who wanted to make a deal....................a sister-in-law, who shall remain nameless, called twice over the weekend, to enquire about an oil painting made by ecw's mother during a class.....of a cactus in bloom........that currently hangs in our dining room with other works, mostly by our family.....pen and ink by kcw.....a nice photograph of a still-life by ecw........some needlework by kcw......and some etchings/prints purchased abroad....................anyway, this painting is nicely situated with it's genre............and this sister-in-law......who had originally asked me to take it, now wanted it back........at least 18 months after the funeral/division of property................wanted to trade it for a vacumn cleaner..............fortunately, my spouse was not in the mood to make a deal, and told her no............

      ok, so mm is still a bit under the weather, and thus can claim sickness as the reason she fell asleep on her sister-in-law's couch yesterday in cincinnati............others, who are less charitable, claim that i was being anti-social........if that were the case, i would have not gone at all.........

      ok, so cnn reported this morning that britney spears went and got married over the weekend..to a friend from back home......at a las vegas wedding chapel that had the audacity to make her go the courthouse and get a wedding liscense and then come back for the ceremony............she wore jeans and a baseball cap............gentle readers, there are few reason that would compel a first-time bride to skip the big ceremony, the gifts and the white dress..............the first is that she was drunk (like rachel and ross on friends.......) or that she is pregnant and needed a husband pronto.........nice of her childhood friend to come to her rescue.......................and so much for britney the role model for young girls.....................

      ok, so mm was totally unprepared for how much she would enjoy the film with robin williams and edward norton.........though every time i try to explain this film it gets a new name......sometimes it's get smootchie, and sometimes it kill smootchie, and sometimes i remember that it is death to smootchie.................i suppose that black comedys can blend together at some point into one big splash of irony.................edward norton was perfect for this part....the rhino in plush pastel part...........just like robin williams, unleashed, was perfect as a darker version of himself.........somehow, jim carey would have cheapened the entire project should he have been cast............regardless, this film was a breathe of fresh air into an otherwise miserably congested day................

      ok, so it is friday, and mm has felt poorly for going on 9 days......the facial pressure and congestion just will not go away..........at least without otc medications which cause annoying side affects (effects?).........i have less than 7 days before a miraculous recovery is required........the good news is that i have only to work a few hours today, and most of saturday, and i will be off for 2 weeks......i have started to sort out some baskets of stuff that call themselves my personal records...so far i have filled a trashbag with stuff that i appear to live well without..........then i may clear out some books that i don't like (and give them to he who wants to sell things on ebay)........and then i may just break down and put pictures in albums...............maybe............

      ok, so mm wishes you and yours a happy new year....................a little late, perhaps, as all of mm's family was asleep by 10 or so................i went to bed about 8:30, and was not the first to make that move...............the last illness-free c-w was feeling so badly that he skipped supper alltogether and stayed in the bed.........and so today, new year's day.....i can say that i feel better.........i feel less annoyed by symptoms at least.................my nephew showed up yesterday afternoon....we have had a good visit with him so far......he is a major lotr fan....both the books and the movies.....he and i commiserated that the first movie left out tom bombadil and the barrow wights(sp), which would explain how merry was able to kill the witch king in the third movie................i read online that 2 people will share the powerball prize......and since ky was not listied as the location of ticket purchase, i am assured that i did not win, yet again................rats...................maybe next time

      ok, so i understand the meaning of leap year....the tacking on a an extra day to assure that the calender falls in line with the seasons after 4 years of the 365 day calender being 5 or so hours off......but what i really need is an honest-to-god real extra day........like an extra sunday, not just an extra day in february.......like bill murray in ground hog day, only one time.....or maybe two times.......just enough to regroup, rest my weary brain cells, maybe get all of those pesky pictures in the albums.........

      ok, so this is no longer about my birthday, as it is past, and i am over it for yet another year.......i enjoyed this entry on/in writer's almanac, about the writer who had what it took to be the bestest ever blogger, if only he was on-line.....  garrison k. has written.....It's the birthday of the great essayist Michel de Montaigne, born in Perigueux, France (1533). His father was a wealthy landowner and a devout Catholic, with innovative ideas about child rearing. He sent the infant Michel to live with peasant parents, so that he would learn to love the lower classes. Then, when Michel was a toddler, his father required everyone in the household to speak Latin rather than French, so that Latin would be his first language. Michel went off to college and became a lawyer. His father died when Michel was thirty-eight years old, and so he retired to the family estate and took over managing the property. His best friend had died a few years before, so he had no one to write to while living on his estate. He grew increasingly bored, so to occupy himself he began to write down his thoughts for an imaginary reader. He wrote about a wide variety of subjects: sadness, idleness, liars, fear, smell, prayer, cannibals, and thumbs, among other things. He called his short pieces "essays" when he published his first collection in 1580, because the French word "essai" comes from the word for "attempt", and he considered the short pieces he wrote to be mere attempts at addressing ideas.   Montaigne didn't think he had an extraordinary mind, but he believed that every mind was unique, and he wanted to leave a record of his own. He wanted to capture on paper the movement of his own thoughts. He said, "I take the first subject Fortune offers: all are equally good for me. I never plan to expound them in full. . . . Everything has a hundred parts and a hundred faces: I take one of them and sometimes just touch it. . . . I jab into it, not as wide but as deep as I can; and I often prefer to catch it from some unusual angle. . . . I can surrender to doubt and uncertainty and to my master-form, which is ignorance. Anything we do reveals us."  He lived at a time when religious civil wars were breaking out all over the country. The Black Plague was ravaging the peasants in his neighborhood; he once saw men digging their own graves and then lying down to die in them. Still, while he occasionally wrote about big subjects like hatred and death, he also wrote about the most ordinary things, like his gardening or the way radishes affected his digestion.  Montaigne wrote, "Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live appropriately. All other things, ruling, hoarding, building, are only little appendages and props, at most."  And he wrote, "Every man bears the whole stamp of the human condition."   Today is also the birthday of our good friend jeff thornton, who looks so much younger than 58..........interestingly enough, i discovered last night at supper, during the 'reasons to vote for kerry' discussion, that we should vote for him because he shares a birthday with our middle child, born december 11......... not in the same chinese new year cycle, but the same day................cayle shares a birthday with abraham lincoln, by the way............though his actual name/lineage has been called into question....seems nancy hanks may have been with child by the head of the household to which she was indentured in north carolina, and she may have been sent 'west' to ky with a husband(mr. lincoln)  attained for just that purpose...........

      ok, so mm has some oscar picks...having actually seen many of the films this year.......for best picture.....there is only one choice..the final installment of lotr.........no more need be said....for best director...peter jackson, for obvious reasons....it was his monumental undertaking to bring this epic to the big screen in a breathtaking way...........and therefore, he should be rewarded for best screenplay using adapted work....even though i am not so sure that he was nominated.......for best original screenplay....sofia coppola for lost in translation...which is as original as it gets.......best actor...johnny depp for pirates of the carribean......not the most dramatic performance, but by far the most memorable and the most enjoyable....charlize theron for monster as best actress......renee zellweger for best supporting actress, and tim robbins for best supporting actor.........the rest i have no clue about.......i am sad that american splendor was not represented well with nominations......i really liked that movie..............sunday night..........we shall see........

      ok, so we had a taste of an almost empty nest, what with the middle child out of town at the nhs convention and the oldest at college.........supper with just one child at the table is just so strange.....especially one who wants to eat multiple servings of meat and no vegetables.......thankfully, said child will be back this afternoon......which reminds me of kind words that one of his teachers remarked as i left the big american studies project on wednesday.......'he is such a sweet boy.....such a sponge...he wants to absorb everything....how can you bear to let him leave home and go to college.....'..........gentle readers........these words are music to a mother's ears.............which brings me back to spring break......if we drive, we may be able to go to places we have never been......like winterthur in delaware, and similar historic homes.......few people in my circle of kin or friends enjoy going to such places as much as the middle child.......

      ok, so mm is sketching out spring break, which will be a mother-son college tour up east.........southwest from louisville to long island/islip is about $200 r/t.........train travel from penn station to princeton junction,  or grand central to new haven appear reasonable, but amtrak from nyc to boston is outrageous.......................i like the idea of flying to nyc and making forays out to select colleges, but i am unclear how to include boston area schools............should i rent a car from long island and drive?  the estimated drive time from danville to 'upeast' is 17 hours.....everybody i ask says 17 hours..............that means 34 hours round trip....or several days out of my life............if anybody out there has an idea................frankly, i would prefer the train because i can read and relax rather than drive.................thankfully, my mother has already taken the child in question to the ohio schools....oberlin, wooster, kenyon, miami of ohio, and dennison..................centre is still in the running, but it is down the street...............

      ok, so you say it's my birthday....iam a gonna have a good time..........cut&pasted is the writer's almanac for today...i knew about anthony burgess, he of a clockwork orange, but not the others..i like the guy who wrote travel experiences.....he may also be kin, as may is a family name......sounds like february 25 is a good day for prolific people to be born.....i am not past chapter one in my novel.......  It's the birthday of novelist and critic Anthony Burgess, born in Manchester, England (1917). He was an incredibly prolific writer: he wrote more than thirty novels, hundreds of essays, film and television scripts, translations, and a two-volume autobiography. He once said, "I refuse no reasonable offer of work and very few unreasonable ones." His first love was music: he studied music in college and tried writing symphonies without much success. When he became famous as a writer, he started writing music again with the hope that he would be able to get it performed because of his name recognition. He once said, "I wish people would think of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of as a novelist who writes music on the side."  After fighting in World War II, he worked for five years as a colonial education officer in Malaya. While he was there, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and a doctor told him he had only one year to live. He later wrote: "I had been granted something I had never had before: a whole year to live. I would not be run over by a bus tomorrow, nor knifed on the Brighton racetrack. I would not choke on a bone. If I fell in the wintry sea I would not drown. I had a whole year, a long time. In that year I had to earn for my prospective widow. . . . I would have to turn myself into a professional writer."  Burgess wrote five novels in the year 1960 alone, and continued to write at a frantic pace for the rest of his life. He's best known for his 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange, about a violent gang in a bleak futuristic world. It begins: "There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip dark chill winter."   It's the birthday of the "Father of Modern Pathology", Giovanni Battista Morgagni, born in Forli, Italy (1682). He's remembered today for his book On the Seats and Causes of Disease, published in 1761, in which he describes in great detail the results of 640 autopsies he performed on patients who had died from diseases. It's considered one of the most important works in the history of medicine.   It's the birthday of novelist Karl May, born in Ernstthal, Germany (1842). He's famous for writing dozens of novels about the American West at a time when not very many Europeans had been there or knew much about it. He was raised in poverty, and during the 1860s and '70s he spent a lot of time in prison for petty theft and fraud. It was while he was in prison that he began to read about American pioneers and cowboys and Indians. He got the idea for a series of novels about the adventures of a heroic German immigrant named Charley and his Apache Indian friend Winnetou. As soon as he published the books, they became hugely popular, especially among German adolescent boys. His novels became some of the most widely read books in Europe.  Many Europeans first learned about the American West through May's novels. All of his books were subtitled "Travel Experiences" rather than "Travel Novels", and most people thought that May was writing about his own travels in the West. But he had actually never been to America when he started writing the novels, and when he finally did go he never made it farther west than St. Louis.  May's novels are still incredibly popular in Germany. Since his death, about 100 million copies of his books have been sold. Many of his novels have been made into movies and TV shows, and in northern Germany, thousands of people still go to see an annual festival that puts on plays based on May's plots.   It's the birthday of comic playwright Carlo Goldoni, born in Venice (1707). He's one of the greatest playwrights in the history of Italian theater, the author of The Liar, The Coffee House, The Beneficent Bear and many others. In the eighteenth century, most Italian plays were farcical comedies in which the actors wore masks and fancy costumes, and improvised jokes on stage. Moldoni was one of the first playwrights to write more realistic comedies, with believable characters and natural dialogue.

      ok, so mm has a soft spot for edna st, vincent millay..........i read this poem on line this morning, and was nearly brought to tears by its sadness.......  Poem: [What lips my lips have kissed] by Edna St. Vincent Millay, from The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay (Modern Library).   What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,  I have forgotten, and what arms have lain Under my head till morning; but the rain Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh Upon the glass and listen for reply,  And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain For unremembered lads that not again Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.  Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree,  Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,  Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:  I cannot say what loves have come and gone;  I only know that summer sang in me A little while, that in me sings so more  I can recall seeing a portrait of the poetess at the national portrait gallery in wash dc......which had a few brief lines of her verse as an epithet.........my candle burns at both ends...it cannot last the night...but ah, my friends, and oh, my foes, it makes a lovely light..................that really sums it all up for me......as a fitting description of what it means to be a working mother/business person in the ought-fours.......of course, millay was a bit more burning of her candle than i could ever desire to be....................

      ok, so this poem was included on writer's almanac today, in honor auden's birthday, which he shares with erma bombeck, ja hin, anais nin, et al.........  Funeral Blues  Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,  Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,  Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.   Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,  Put crpe bows round the white necks of the public doves,  Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.   He was my North, my South, my East and West,  My working week and my Sunday rest,  My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;  I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.   The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,  Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,  Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;  For nothing now can ever come to any good.

      ok, so mm was born into a family of republicans. so she wants to acknowledge the influence of her grandmother helen kreager crown, who seems to be the sole democrat between both sides of kin......she was a died in the wool democrat based on the party's social programs.....even when whe did not know how to drive, she cautioned my grandfather that she would vote democrat if he took her to town to vote.............

      ok, so mm really enjoyed the national nbc news story last evening that highlighted the special election in ky....and predicted that it might indicate an erosion of not only dubya's coattails, but also may indicate the turn of the tide.....democrat chandler won with double-digits over republican alice forgy kerr...whose ads featured her walking nearly arm-in-arm with dubya on the white house porch................we also had an astonishing voter turnout for a special election.................though chandler's newly elected term is a mere 8 months.......anyone who chooses to run against him for relection this fall must be shaking in 'they shoes'  because it won't be the cakewalk pundits predicted after chandler lost to republican ernie fletcher for the governor's mansion...............but then, the state of fresh off the governor's mistress scandal.............and that stench appears over..........................congrats to chandler....................

      ok, so this morning, when the mm was at her polling place at 8:05 am.....there was a new person at the official sihn-in book......and i was asked for SOME FORM OF IDENTIFICATION.......gentle readers......mm has voted at this same location for 22 years, and only had to give id the very first time......because the polling people were either.....people who lived near to me...or people i went to church with....or people who had attended a class that i had given on cholesterol....or people who read my article........this morning there were no such people in eyesight...........but as i turned to run out to the car to get my wallet...........a little lady came walking from the vicinity of the bathrooms, and said...i know her...she once put me on a diet...........i voted my quick little special election selection............and went on my way..........the issue of identification has been huge at trc this past week.............due to an altercation in which we refused service to a young -looking person who could not produce a driver's liscense...........her parents were with her, and they became angry because we could not take their word on her age...........legally, all who have been served alcohol must have proof of age available to show an ABC inspector, who has the right to do so at any given and unannounced moment...........in fact, the 'my daughter is old enough to drink' ruse is one that was mentioned in our alcohol training class as a favorite used by inspectors..........granted...........this child had graduated from college, and could have been old enough to drink, but i personally know one darling prodegy who will graduate college before she is old enough to drink............so even that argument won't hold up.......no id, no alcohol...........this person actually lives close enough to have gone home and gotten her purse if drinks were that important...........

      ok, so the second chapter of my great novel/screenplay will include, among other things.....recycling.......i have recycled from the second week or so.......when i realized that a large volume of waste paper/cardboard/plastic/glass/metal went through our restaurant...i decided that i could take these things to the recyling center myself..................in the past 3.5 years, i have personally taken countless loads of stuff in the back of my van to the bypass.........and still.....there are people who work with me who cannot do simple things....like empty the beer bottles before putting them in the bins......or put the bottles in the boxes rather than in the plastic trash bag that lines the recycle bin..............last saturday, i had to nearly disrobe because beer leaked down my person as i was carrying a hefty load to my vehicle..............much as i like a nice cold one........old, skanky beer that spills on one's shirt and jeans is unpleasant.........................even tonight, i had to go behind people that i pay to take beer bottles out of the trash, and place them personally in the recycling..................how is it that cictzens of this earth cannot see the big picture when it comes to solid waste?????????........yes recycling will be in the second chapter.................

      ok, so mm has an opinion the subject.......i was so touched to read about the couple who were married yesterday in sf........they had been together almost as long as i have been alive.....and they chose to be publically cemented as person and person..................and yet the neysayers have already filed suit...................as if those two people's odds-defying relationship somehow impacts their sense of family/home/values..................how silly....................in my own life...so many hetero relationships did not last out the 1year/2 year or anywhere close..............and they spent outrageous amounts of cash on a doomed relationship..............the bottom line.............in a country where government separates church and state....how can the legislature rule on marriage anyway....................................isn't it the churche's job....................

      ok, so gail and i are sitting on oprah's stage, made-over in the very subtlest of ways...with nice outfits and professional make-up...nothing poofy or rude..........and oprah turns to me and asks.....so how did you meet your millionaire friend gail?.....................i guess it all goes back to lisa......one of the waitresses we hired to get us through the very first day.............she either answered the ad, or knew joyce....i really don't remember............but early on we decided that we needed an extra person, and lisa said that she knew somebody................now lisa was wound tight, in the classic typecast of hattie mcqueen in gwtw..........she would talk a mile-a-minute....and say absolutely nothing..........and she seemed unable to think outside the box.......at the time we did not have a liquor license, and it was customary for people dining uptown to 'bring their own'..........we were unsure how to handle these bottles.......we had a corkscrew, but it was unclear as to whether our waitstaff could legally open a bottle, or if we could simply supply the corkscrew to a table with the glasses and pretend that we did not know what the guests planned to do with these items.............a table of four came in with a nice bottle of red, and began to hand the bottle to lisa to open.....the litterally threw her hands up in the air and jumped backwards.......Shrieked, and said that she could not touch their bottle for fear of losing her job...................all i could thinkabout the story when i heard it was ...i don't know nothin about opening wine bottles...........anyway...........lisa introduced us to gail...where lisa was all drama..........with her hair, her over-the-top nails, her family problems, her shrill voice........gail was so laid back as to be a slow burn................she was slow to react, slow to anger.......and so personable as to be just like family from the get-go............and then there was the figuring out just what we had in common...............at first, i found out that i had worked with one of her sisters, eartha, at the hosital for the past 18 years................they had a vague resemblance.......so that was easy..........i also think that i had met her mother in some professional capacity..............but that was not the biggest revelation................at the time trc was not open for dinner unless a private party was booked......we would create a custum menu for the group.....often paid for by a drug company rep....who brought beer and wine.......and worried over taking home the leftover shrimp cocktail..............typically such events lasted as long was the alcohol lasted............giving the lowly kitchen help time to chat whilst serving up plates or running dishes through the machine................yes.....gail has three children.....no, she had never married their father, despite the longterm relationship..............she referred to him as jimmy two.............which reminded me of someone i had worked with at the hospital in the kitchen..........she called her husband two-ly...............gail shrieked..........................just like lisa, only with more emotion.........i was wondering when you would figure that out.........................here is the bottom line.........my friend sheila had been married to jimmy two sometime before/during/after the time that gail had 3 daughters with him...............and...at the time we were speaking, gail was dating the man who fathered a child with another person i worked with in the kitchen named valerie..............whoooooooo...this was almost too much to be revealed at one time........................sheila has since been divorced from jimmy two and married a white man who fathered her child, then killed himself by shutting himself in his garage with a running vehicle..........though the family denied that it was intentional.........it happened to occur just when sheila threatened to divorce him.................according to gail, sheila now lives in lexington, had gained substantial girth, and is quite settled...................anyway....back to my friend gail....................we did turn out to have many meaningrul things in common............our oldest children were in the same class at the high school, and we also had children in the same class at the middle school.............her middle child and my youngest did not match up...but no matter.............the notion that my children went to the city schools depsite our residence in the county was a topic of conversation in it's own right-......do you have to pay to send your kids to danville?......no, because they were grandfathered in..................at the time andrew would have gone to middle school from montesorri, most of his friends were going to the city schools......the statistics on high school-to-college advancement were compelling.....many more city kids went on to college.............and then there was the 'cultural diversity' question.................the faces in the city schools looked more like the real world.............while the makeup of county classes resembled the fading memory that i had of growing up in rural ohio................everyone was white, or shades of white..........and blacks were people you heard about on tv..........i had gone to school in an integrated system briefly in the 5th grade, but we had moved back to a purely white county with my dad's work by the 6th...........i never saw another person of color until i walked into the kitchen of mount carmel medical center in downtown columbus, ready to start work at a diet technician........code for kitchen skivvy..............anyway............we purposely sent our children to the integrated school.....despite warnings...............your child will be afraid to even go to the bathroom for fear of getting beat up or having his lunchmoney stolen.................yeah, right...................anyway..........back to lisa...................her daily dose of drama became tiresome........and her last catfight with joyce soured us on even considering retaining her.........but that brought up the question of gail...............she and lisa spoke on the phone before work every day,.......and after work every day....and during work every day.........if lisa quit, would gail quit, too?...............................

      ok, so my poor 11 year-old, whose birthday was supposed to be celebrated this evening.....missed out on her class's valentine's day party because she took ill sometime after lunch..........this is horrible....to be 11, and to have both your birthday and valentine's celebrations messed up...............i gave her one of her gifts early....lion king 1 and one half.......as a consolation prize for coming home early...............and when we got home...there was the mail...............even though it was cayle's birthday.........she recieved less than 1/5 the mail that her college-prospect brother received.............which almost brought tears............we may need a wheelbarrow to bring in the college mail if this keeps up................before i got the call from school, my millionaire friend gail and i were just about to peruse the people and us issues that focused on janet's stunt, and oprah's birthday bashes.........we have decided that our longterm goal should be more than to be guests on oprah...we want to be invited to her next birthday bash....................

      ok, so i am in need of a climax................i cannot think of what a realistic restaurant climax would be............fire, water, gas leak/explosion..........none of these sound like anywhere i want to go.................maybe the climax needs to be something in gail's life............a marriage proposal/job opportunity..........or maybe our lottery win puts the future in question...i lie awake at night thinking about how i want this story line to go.......now that i have centered on the white/black aspects.........i cannot think of a climax that both gail and i would repect in the morning...so to speak..............is an effective climax supposed to be a choice, a catasprophe.....a turning point......maybe a bad health department inspection......or a drug bust with all of our night employees secretly selling cocaine beneath our radar...................i cannot decide................maybe hemingway would just have another plate of oysters and a bottle of dry white sancerre........and eventually the solution would come to him...............

      ok, so i have been informed that barbara kingsolver's book pigs in heaven includes an oprah interview.............i am devistated, as my entire project rests on the fantasy converation that gail and i have with oprah on a daily basis................surely oprah is a big enough personality to handle both me and turtle from the bean trees....i apologize that i have not made time to read pigs in heaven.....in louisville last year i almost bought it at a goodwill, but i bought cayle a pair of pants instead........................anyway.......................the oprah interview is at the core of our story...right up there with our bi-racial friendship.........this march my mother is traveling to arizona to meet with her cousin who blew open the story....that a brother of a great great or something grandfather was married to a black woman.somewhere in ohio...and that the family basically disavowed them...and that gail and i have spent time trying to figure out if we are ,in fact, related.because her daddy's people were from ohio..............my middle child has looked at opberlin, which was a college first to allow black students...this is a positive connection..........as is my family history.............my grandparents home in indepedence, ohio (10 miles from lake erie) was built by german immigrants and sensitive to liberal causes....................it was a last stop on the underground railroad....my mother remembers the secret place under the steps....................when my grandpa died, the picture of the house was in the paper..........my mother cannot find it now, of course..................i am sure of one thing about my novel/screenplay.......it is an uninvestigated genre.........how many white women try to figure out who they are related to in the black community..............i say that this is uncharted waters and i will be there for the publishing of such..............

      ok, so some microfiche has been located in some file in colorado that includes dates in 1972 and 1973 when bush WAS PAID for national guard service in alabama.........however, the commentator who i heard on the radio this afternoon raised the more important question......how is it that someone who served for 2 years can produce no 'buddies' of any kind who remember him?   how is that the first time this issue came up..in the 2000 election...no person who remembered bush from the national guard came forward............sounds like daddy arranged for his boy to be 'paid' for dates in which he was elsewhere....and now that the pay dates are public record.....i am confident that some brilliant reportor will find some hard evidence that he was not in alabama on those days..........wouldn't that be rich...if bush had, say, a dui in new haven on a day in which he was paid to be in alabama.........i can only pray.............

      ok, so having google as our homr page has blocked over 1000 pop-up ads as of today.....such a milestone....................i have not missed any of these ads, by the way.......in the past 48 hours i have watched the following films......l'auberge espagnole, the hours, under the tuscan sun, lostin translation, and wings of the dove.....the first 4 were rented...the last one we own, and i watched it for contrast to wings of the dove........i am still troubled for having seen the hours twice....mostlt because i so love woolf's work...i have read to the lighthouse numerous times....and her short piece...a room of one's own is a classic in feminist thought.................the way that she was portrayed by nicole kidman was breathtakingly tragic.....................she was so emotionally fragile, and too intellectually brilliant to live long.............despite the love of a good and caring man..............on the other hand....under the tuscan sun was too lame as to deserve criticism.............such a bastardization of the book/sequel to the book..................does a screenplay require a lesbian chinese woman about to deliver an in-vitro baby in order to get the desired audience?........................

      ok, so mm has thought of a way to include the fact gail and i discuss our trials and tribulations with children, but without actually bringing up anything specific about our children that would haunt them in anyway..........we will simply have yet another cartoon, of ourselves holding up a placard that reads.......this is  the part where we fuss about our children...the brief lapse in the script reflects the lack of remaining dialogue after each and every child had a chance to edit out their own 'stuff'. we apologize for lack of full understanding that you the veiwer would have gained from knowing just how difficult it is to be a mother in america.........

      ok, so at lunch today i sketched out both the ending and the begining of my saga....................one needs to know these things.............i like the idea of 4 endings....choices a,b,c or all of the above............gail and i have discussed each possibility at length...........in fact...........we have discussed most of this screenplay at length...we just did not know that our musings merited such attention................i would like to incorporate the best parts of american splendor...the cartoon parts.......i see in my mind's eye new yorker cartoons throughout.......the first is like this......a script thinner than a best buy ad....labeled...our screenplay as our family and friends would wish us to disclose about our lives/their lives...................the next is a whopping nyc phonebook-type script...labeled.....our screenplay about our lives as we recall it..........and the third......a modest little script....labeled  compromise..................this afternoon, we watched l'auberge d'espagnole.....which had some amusing elements......then lost in translation, which my family who had not seen it before did not like at all.....then under the tuscan sun....which is a distruction of what had been a delightful novel...............lots to learn about plot development, backstory, pace.....dialogue.....if i never get this done....i have had the glee of the notion of it..................

      ok, so my friend gail and i have already debated on who should play us in the movie...............gail suggested that meryl streep would be perfect as the mm.......she has such a gracious elegance laced with spunk.............gail at first wanted halle berry, but she confessed that halle was so pretty that people would not forget that she was halle berry and not believe that she was gail griffin........she she opted for angela bassett, who plays many strong black women on the big screen...............the novel will open with gail and i imaging we are on oprah winfrey, talking about our novel/film/screenplay...............we often do imagine what we will say when we are on oprah as her special guests...............mostly we are invited because we have given so much of lottery winnings to scholarship funds..................which brings me to the working title......my millionaire friend...............

      ok, so my good friend gail told me tonight at the catering event, in between periods of salad assembly and such, that she likes to read my blog because she can see the novel that will come out of it..............now this is news to me.....who has finally come to grips with my personal learning disabilities.....i think that i reread novels not just to revisit the content, but because i skim when i read...i simply cannot read every word as it is presented...ergo...i must read and reread to get all of the words/phrases/paragraphs................i also wonder if i have some sort of left handed dislexia.....as my misspells are related to my left handed/right brained typing...............anyway......my friend gail and i....i should call her my millionnaire friend gail....as we play the lottery every wednesday and saturday (for the past 4 years....) we have determined just how we will spend the money to up the ante for the danville school system with scholarships/grants/book reimbursement.....we only have to win the money in order to implement our plans.........anyway......my friend gail should really write a screenplay, like sofia coppola..............like her lost in translation except in danville, ky about the people who come and go in the restaurant/catering business................that could be our niche..................and why not?.....she went to school with frank x walker...................why couldn't we hit it big, too?.................even if we do not......she was generous in her affirmation of my blog, which i consider part diary/ part cathartic outlet, and part fiction workshop...................as oprah says, everybody should have a gail as a friend...................

      ok, so mm is outraged about the following news from cnn.com.............   DENTON, Texas (AP) -- About 40 people gathered outside an Eckerd pharmacy Monday, protesting what they said was a decision to deny a rape victim a prescription for the morning-after pill.   A spokesman for the Florida-based company confirmed that Eckerd has taken disciplinary action in response to an incident at the store.   "Apparently there was a request for a prescription to be filled and the prescription was denied based on a moral or ethical decision made by the pharmacist, and that's not in accordance with our corporate policy," said Joan Gallagher, vice president of communications for Largo, Florida-based Eckerd Corp. Gallagher told the Denton Record-Chronicle that she could provide no other details.   The protesters carried signs. Some stood silently and others chanted slogans. Morning-after pills have been sold under the brand names Plan B and Preven since 1998. Taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse, the hormone pills are at least 75 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. An unidentified friend of the woman seeking the prescription told the newspaper she got the drug from a neighboring pharmacy.   Gay Dodson, executive director of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy, said state law allows pharmacists to decline filling prescriptions if the medication could harm the patient. "The law does not say that the pharmacy can decline because of moral ground," she said. I find the refusal to fill a physician prescribed medication reprehensible.......it is the woman's choice to bear a rapist's baby, or not to do so, not the pharmacists.......

      ok, so the jacksons have done it again..........and it wasn't pretty..........janet's right implanted breast popped out of her costume with help from justin timberlake at the end of their lame duet at the superbowl halftime......she was wearing a pastie, so it is likely the stunt was planned...........now the fcc is going to investigate the indecent incident, as half-time was still in primetime, when familys were watching...........so silly......as her breasts are so swollen as to be pitiable not shocking................

      ok, so mm finally got to watch le divorce, based so loosely on the diane johnson novel that i barely recognized it.......the pared-down screenplay left most of the subplots unfilmed or on the cutting room floor.......and left out so many characters and combined so many others that i had a hard time figuring out who was who in the reinvented version........the few things that remained true to the book.......roxanne is having a baby, but her french husband has left her for a crazy russian writer/painter......her sister isabelle is having an affair with her sister's husband's aging (age 55) uncle........he buys her a herme kelly bag worth beaucoup euros at the beginning and a hermes scarf worth beaucoup bucks at the end.......and the crazy russian woman's husband goes crazy himself at the finale........other than seeing fine food on lovely plates in upscale restaurants in paris...the film was a bust.....except for the fine aging uncle edgar, played by theirry ______...now he was just perfect as the 'aging' lethario..............we should all be so lucky...........

      ok, so at lunch we had 'everybody' for lunch, and the discussion somehow went from the picture in the danville advocate with our little our group and nicole and her friend in montmartre........and how the meal at that restaurant was bad, and how we took the bus back from montmartre because nicole insisted, and how on this trip i finally got to see the small statue of the liberty that stands up river from the eiffel tower on its own little island.....my mother informed me that i had seen that statue in 1972 when our family of four first went to europe.............i have no recollection of this, and other facts she reclled like they were yesterday........like how i took a gideon bible from the hotel in amsterdam and left $2 american in exchange.......and how i had seen my cousin nancy in the metro on the way to the louvre where we were to meet her, and how my mother had been upset when she saw me waving to someone in a country where we didn't know anyone..............these things did not stick in my brain........either they were non-important details, or i have selected what was important to remember in my limited brain slots and have forgotten the rest, or my mother remembers things that did not happen....either way it is clear that one's relatives will always remember the oddities in one's life, even when we have conveniently forgotten them............

      ok, so the entire c-w family has rented 3 dvd's, and is systematically working their way through them.......last night we watched nicholas nickelby (sp?), a humerous rendition that was nominated last year for some golden globes........dickens really had a way with satire as well as wit and wisdom.....then we watched seabiscuit, a fine retelling of the bestselling book.....both ecw and i had read the book...........which was nonfiction.......the director did a great job of making this true story into a dramatic film........today we will watch the royal tennenbaums, less of us due to the rating and acw's return to uk....i have heard that it is humerous as well......regardly of how much i enjoyed the movies i rented, i did not go to the movie place to rent any of them.....i wanted to see le divorce, but all of the dvd copies were out and the video place hadn't bothered with vhs copies at all......i also wanted to see my house in umbria (out.....) and the one with diane lane about a house refurbishment in tuscany (not yet released in dvd form......)....so i rented what seemed like the best of the rest............

      ok, so the life of brian will be re-released this week........25 years after it was soundly dispensed from screens for utter heresy...........25 years ago.....i can recall seeing it on the big screen...and i found it to be irreverant in the very best sense...........in the same way that i like the last temptation of christ..............some things need to be seen from a separate perspective....and religious themes are especially in need of dissection................i will have to leave this blog and preorder the dvd.................

      ok, so the mm has spent this little minute on-line, getting all of the details for visits....tour hours....maps for getting to the place that the tour starts, parking information.......this much is true........these campuses now look alike to me.................maples in bright fall brilliance, brick walks/walls/buildings, expanses of green, students listening intently, professors teaching intently.......in fact, the campus of middlebury (from the on-line picture) looks quite like kenyon college in gambier, ohio...at least as i remember it when we biked by on the rails-to-trails bike path..........at some point the differences must become clearer......because at this point....................

      ok, so mm has a moral decision to make with regards to the yet to be written novel/screenplay....................my (millionaire) friend gail and i savored a quite glass of wine after work this afternoon....while we waited for an elderly, yet notorious customer to finally give up chatting and go home after 4.5 hours.............anyway.......we got to talking about a personal issue with one of her daughters...........and we even brought scw into it, to find out what he knew about it at the high school, and it occurred to me that there are so many issues that i am unclear about how to address......mostly regarding gender/sexual/financial issues...with regards to my workmates and their families...that i find myself editing out of this blog, and therefore this novel/screenplay...the very issues that gail and i discuss most often.................the premise of my book is about 2 women, who have more in common than they ever dreamed they had in common......find friendship/affirmation/support at work.............lots of standing around talking...but that is what most female relationships are based on..............i hate to lose the conversation we had this afternoon, but i am hesitant to record it for posterity given that it was her child and not mine we discussed.................i gues that is why so many screenplays/novels are fiction and not reality...................but we have material so much better than what we could ever make up.................

      ok, so i really enjoyed the xavier/texas game last night...............not that i am such a basketball fan that i will watch any game just to get my fix.....but because xavier is located in cincinnati, my beloved's home town, and just down the road from our first apartment together........we lived there while he was going to graduate school.......and we used to go to sunday night guitar mass in the xavier chapel..............it was not enough to move me to embrace catholicism, but it was nice nonetheless..........anyway.....xavier was really on a roll......though i did not quite understand the double technicals called against the texas coach with 4 seconds to go...........he was ejected from the game, by the way....which seemed pointless with 4 seconds on the clock...........now xavier must beat kansas to get to the final four..........it would be so sweet for xavier to beat duke/uconn/st joe to win it all............

      ok, so i have borrowed the following from the shouts and murmurs section of the new worker, for which i do subscribe.........  LIBERAL RADIO NETWORK EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION by BRUCE McCALL Issue of 2004-03-29 Posted 2004-03-22 We are an equal-opportunity, pro-choice, antiwar, non-smoking, non-sectarian network with a fiftyfifty male/female staff that recycles.

Personal Information:  DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE    We respect your civil rights and your right to privacy and do not ask you to reveal any personal information.

      ok, os mm has dug up another 2-3 feet or so of yard/planting bed.....and i have yet to find the lateral line that i know is somewhere underneath.........the digging is hampered by the state of my tools......my trusty digging fork has become laughably bent...and the handle comes off of the tines about every third swoosh of dirt............this digging fork has a history...because it was not the one that i had requested as a birthday gift so many years ago.........my dear spouse was going up to cincinnati for a quick visit with his mother and father just about the time that smith and hawkins built a store less than 1 mile from their home.......and just about the time when thinking about birthday gift possibilities was in the air.............i asked for a smith and hawkins digging fork...the one that has the handle permanently doweled/bolted/forged into the handle...at the time it cost about $35......i had seen a similar one at the chelsea flower show, and was disuaded to put off the purchase, which would have required bringing the fork back from heathrow as checked luggage.........and don't you know.....my late mother-in-law talked my spouse out of buying it......said it was much too expensive....and steered him toward one from Frank's Nursery that undoubtedly cost much less.....which i use, bent and disassembled yet today................it looks just like the twisted and bent digging fork that i was using at the time i asked for the top-of-the line model............so....do i get on-line and order myself a better digging fork, or get in the car and drive to cincinnati in search of one....or go tomorrow to the local nursury and treat myself to the best that they have...................i will keep you posted.......for now, i am content to wallow in my angst about my pair of nearly useless forks.....as i continue to search for these elusive lateral lines.............

      ok, so mm wants to weigh in on the pledge debate.................the pledge strikes me as so very nazi/stalinist russian.......i have no idea how we came to see a pledge as agreeable to a free society......alone one that requires the utterance of 'under god'......i say this as a christian who fully accepts that her god may not be the only god, and therefore we cannot go around making school children act like there is just one...............i am saddened that a child custody case is at the bottom of the court case..........another pitiful event in the story of the american family..........the amendment to outlaw gay marriage did not make it out of committee here in the bluegrass......which surprises me.........yet, lexington is apparently one of the top 10 locations for gay couples to relocate....according to my partner's partner..............i was under the impression that this nation was built on religious tolerance................not necessarily  on christian principles..............ah well..................

      ok, so mm emailed npr.org this morning to protest the early 'out-to-pasture' reassignment of bob edwards, who wakes her up so calmly yet enthusiastically every weekday............his reassignment actually made the frontpage of the lexington herald leader, as bob is a native kentuckian, and kentuckians really do take their public radio seriously..........wuky was the very first fm public radio station............and though wuky does not broadcast uk basketball games, there is still enough eclectic programming to satisfy a broad range of listeners...........

      ok, so the back page of the new yorker, by roz chast is absolutely hysterical, with an 'are you entering your goddess years?' quiz, and humorous cartoons depicting typical goddess garb, such as tunics, bold jewelry, and ethnic hair........i, the mm, have no inner goddess...of this i am certain.....the only personality lurking inside is a travel agent/ tour guide.........and those who know me well, or who have had the ultimate pleasure of traveling with me, know that orchestrating travel is something that i live for....which brings me to this afternoon.......i am digging up the plantings in our side yard...the area that i call my bathroom garden because i can look out while i am getting dressed and see the lilac, the therese bugnet rose, the luneria, etc.........and the bushes that i am trying to preserve, now that i am told that they may be strangling the lateral lines of the septic system...........the quotation that we were given to dig down to the lateral lines would cover a trip this january to florence.....so i am digging it up myself.....so far i have uncovered a solid 12 inches of lateral line....and i am now taking a well-earned break...................i have no good place to put the dirt, as this is a well-planted area........with 16 years of established growth/root systems..............granted, one of the goddess qualifications involved 'extreme importance of the home and garden'.........well, my garden plantings are important to me.....and i will go to great lengths to avoid digging up my brick walkway.....lateral line # 1 is about 6 inches from the walk....i am praying that the leak will be on this line, and not on line #2, which runs directly under my walk and my rosebush..........yes, i could move the bush, but i like looking out on when it blooms.............anyway, back to the goddess thing......i despise herbal teas...................bring on the caffeine.........

      ok, so mm thought this poem, included in today's writer's almanac...was so very clever.....  Poem: "Permanently," by Kenneth Koch, from Selected Poems, 1950-1982 (Vintage).   Permanently   One day the Nouns were clustered in the street. An Adjective walked by, with her dark beauty. The Nouns were struck, moved, changed. The next day a Verb drove up, and created the Sentence.  Each Sentence says one thingfor example, "Although it was a dark    rainy day when the Adjective walked by, I shall remember the pure    and sweet expression on her face until the day I perish from the    green, effective earth." Or, "Will you please close the window, Andrew?" Or, for example, "Thank you, the pink pot of flowers on the window    sill has changed color recently to a light yellow, due to the heat from    the boiler factory which exists nearby."  In the springtime the Sentences and the Nouns lay silently on the grass. A lonely Conjunction here and there would call, "And! But!" But the Adjective did not emerge.  As the adjective is lost in the sentence, So I am lost in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat-- You have enchanted me with a single kiss Which can never be undone Until the destruction of language.

      ok, so the mm did not say that......it was said by phillip roth.....He published his first book, the collection of short stories Goodbye Columbus, in 1959, and it got good reviews and won several awards. But a few years later, he went to speak at a university in New York City, and the audience attacked him, shouting that he was writing anti-Semitic literature. When he tried to leave the stage, a crowd surrounded him, shouting and waving their fists, and he barely got away without being hurt. Later that night he said, "I'll never write about Jews again." He worked on a novel with no Jewish characters called When She Was Good (1967), but it wasn't any fun to write, and he realized that he couldn't give up on writing about his background. He figured that if everyone thought he was offensive, he might as well try to write a book that was as offensive as possible. He set out write a novel in the wild, obscene voice that he remembered from his childhood friends. He had started psychoanalysis at the time, and he got the idea of writing the book from the point of view of a patient on his psychoanalyst's couch.   That book became Portnoy's Complaint (1969), about Alexander Portnoyhis obsession with sex, and his struggles with his Jewish parents, especially his mother. It begins, "She was so deeply imbedded in my consciousness that for the first year of school I seem to have believed that each of my teachers was my mother in disguise." It was one of the most sexually explicit books ever published, and it became one of the best-selling books of the 1960s. Jewish critics attacked Roth for his portrayal of Jews, and others attacked him for his obscenity, but he had decided that he no longer cared if he offended his readers. He said, "I cannot and do not live in the world of discretion, not as a writer, anyway. I would prefer to, I assure youit would make life easier. But discretion is, unfortunately, not for novelists."  He has gone on to write many more novels, most of them narrated by a fictional writer named Nathan Zuckerman, including American Pastoral (1997), I Married a Communist (1998) and The Human Stain (2000). His most recent novel is The Dying Animal (2001). Roth said, "The road to hell is paved with works-in-progress."

      ok, so the mm wants to go to nyc instead of boston, especially if the scholar involved has no intentions of applying to mass schools.......we could go to the whitney exhibit described in my longterm cultural bible......the new yorker......for the un-informed......my relationship with this magazine goes back to 1978, when in graduate school at the cincinnati center for developmental disorders, housed at the university of cincinnati.....i would walk in the door on monday morning and find last week's new yorker on the coffee table......i took it to read, and sometimes remembered to bring it back for someone else.......my favorite framed art pieces are actually new yorker covers...............not originals.....but you have to get close to tell................for the record, several of the doctor's on our staff were holocaust survivors.....i have seen a prison camp tatoo only once in person, and that was in a case conference, when dr.oppenheimer's sleeve came up too high................i have calculated driving distances...and would desire to drive back from new haven more so than from boston.....but this is not my decision...........the scholar has the last word..............because.....i could just as well see the glass flowers at harvard (again) or the isabella gardiner museum (again), or the wonderful winslow homer pictures at the fine arts museum.....i have a lovely framed print by homer of two boys in a field that i purchased sometime in the early 90's.......it could be a portrait of my own boys...............so idyllic...............

      ok, so my new waitress, grace, from centre.....told me tonight that i seemed to her to be a quasi-post-hippie sort of person.........i like that description, being too young to have been a hippie in the first round.........and too old to be a post-hippie...or a neo-hippie.........the subject came up with the discussion of a common friend of grace and the bartender who recently left danville with his guitar for a rainbow reunion in utah.............oh, to be young and footloose........grace, ironically decried danville for it's lack of a feeling of community.........which i explained to her as merely her lack of putting down and roots here..................you ownly reap what you sow...................anyway, i am so proud of being categorized as such...............and certainly relieved to not being mistaken for some sort of conservative matron................possibly the worst form of insult in my estimation......................

      ok, so we have a new person working for us........a woman who has moved to danville from a spousal abuse shelter in lexington, and before that from parts unknown..........she does not know a soul in danville, yet seems relieved to be among reasonable people...she has read this town well........her two children are doing well in the city school system, and and has hopes of settling down.........others have taken to her as well......friday, the lunch wait-staff allowed her to 'take a few tables' so she could earn a bit of gas money prior to the weekend........i feel guilty, as a i could have sent home some leftovers had i fully understood the situation.......this is the scenario that brings the brutal realization....i live in a cushy reality, with a caring, equitable spouse...............and full support for my every whim........there are those who have never known such, and grasp for every shred of dignity .................my sunday school class is taking up a collection to buy her children easter baskets..................i hope that we can do more substantial things in the future..............

      ok, so on the way to church, npr weekend edition profiled a fellow who is currently at the san diego padres training camp...hoping to become the first mit graduate to play major league baseball...........the joke was told....it may just very well take a rocket scientist to be a good pitcher........he may not just be a graduate, he may actually be a phd candidate, though i cannot be sure of those details......he seemed quite personable, and hopeful for this part of his career to 'take off'......at least we know this story to be true.....in sunday school, we were visited for the third-straight sunday by a largish lady with streaked purple hair........who seems to have a changeable story to tell, at best..........my teaching partner sat next to her.....and discovered that she may or may not live in a house she and her mother donated to centre college, and theymay or may not have had a beauty salon in a building that has housed a pediatrician's office for the past 25 years........and she may or may not donate easters to the local children's home.....she demured to comment when someone offered to take these baskets out to the campus, given that she no longer drives............we discussed these lapses at family lunch today...partly because they so trouble me, and also because i want my daughter to know that when she makes up stories, they are just as troubling to her friends...........this is the same person who last week was so gushy (along with her mother) about how true to the bible the mel movie was........these are the times when it is hard to love thy neighbor......and she is who is without sin shall cast the first stone.........my fear is that her stories may discourage others from coming to our class.........pray for us...................

      ok, so mm is really encouraged at this point.....from denver........  DENVER, Colorado (AP) -- About 300 people of different faiths turned out to clean up a synagogue vandalized with swastikas and Nazi symbols on the eve of the Jewish holiday Purim.    So many people showed up Sunday at BMH-BJ Congregation, where vandalism had been discovered the day before, that people had to stand in line for a turn with a brush and a can of paint thinner.   "This is a place for everyone," said Doug Mix, who is not a member of the congregation. "That is why everyone is here. There are Christians, Jews, Muslims and people who are not religious. We all came out here because America is still America, and we don't tolerate this."   A custodian for the synagogue discovered about 10 markings when he arrived Saturday morning. Purim was celebrated Saturday night and Sunday. Police had not made any arrests by Monday.   Holocaust survivor Fanny Starr saw the graffiti Saturday morning.   "I was just shaking and broke down," she said. "All the wounds, the old wounds starting open again."   Rabbi Daniel Cohen said the vandalism may have been sparked by Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ," which just finished its second weekend as the No. 1 movie in the country. The movie, which some believe wrongly blames Jews for the death of Christ, has been criticized as anti-Semitic.   Elise Zakroff said she was sure the film inspired the graffiti.   "What Mel Gibson did is terrible," Zakroff said. "It is happening all over. We are tired of anti-Semitism. All we want is peace."   Shortly after the movie opened, a Denver pastor outraged Jews and Christians with a sign outside his Lovingway United Pentecostal Church that read "Jews Killed The Lord Jesus."   He said the sign was inspired by Gibson's film and later put a sign of apology.   In 2002, anti-Semitic incidents rose 8 percent nationwide over the previous year, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Colorado had 35 anti-Semitic incidents.

      ok, so the new yorker is taking much of the mm's flack these days....this time...the baylor lariet is putting out liberal commentary as yet unknown to baptist doctrine..............  COMMENT  WEDDED BLITZ Issue of 2004-03-15 Posted 2004-03-08 The deliberations of the editorial board of the Baylor Lariat do not normally attract widespread notice beyond the environs of Waco, Texasor within them, for that matterbut these are not normal times, and the Lariats editorial the other Friday was not, in the opinion of some, a sufficiently normal editorial. After summarizing the events surrounding the current fuss over same-gender matrimony, the Lariat editors stated their view. Gay couples should be granted the same equal rights to legal marriage as heterosexual couples, they wrote. Like many heterosexual couples, they went on to conclude,  many gay couples share deep bonds of love, some so strong theyve persevered years of discrimination for their choice to co-habitate with and date one another. Just as it isnt fair to discriminate against someone for their skin color, heritage or religious beliefs, it isnt fair to discriminate against someone for their sexual orientation. Shouldnt gay couples be allowed to enjoy the benefits and happiness of marriage, too?    (This, by the way, was followed by a boldface tagline: editorial board vote: 5-2. Wouldnt it be nice if the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal practiced this sort of transparency?)  The Baylor Lariat is the campus newspaper of Baylor University. Baylor, with fourteen thousand students, describes itself as the oldest institution of higher learning in the state and the largest Baptist university in the world, and is a bastion of Christian conservatism.  The unchristian kind, too, apparently. The president of Baylor, Robert B. Sloan, Jr., quickly lowered the boom. Espousing in a Baylor publication a view that is so out of touch with traditional Christian teachings is not only unwelcome, it comes dangerously close to violating University policy, as published in the Student Handbook, prohibiting the advocacy of any understandings of sexuality that are contrary to biblical teaching, President Sloan stated, adding darkly, The Student Publications Board will be addressing this matter with the Lariat staff as soon as possible. Sure enough, that same day, the Student Publications Boardwhich evidently functions in the Baylor context the way the Ideology Department of the Communist Party used to function in the Soviet contextannounced that the Lariat had indeed violated policy and assured the world that the guidelines have been reviewed with the Lariat staff, so that they will be able to avoid this error in the future.  It was no great surprise that the Lariats foray into dissidence was promptly squelched. What was startling was that such a foray, in such a place, was ventured at all. It was more startling, in its way, than the pro-gay-marriage ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, three weeks earlier. Waco, after all, is far from Boston. And the vote in the Supreme Judicial Court was narrower4-3, not 5-2.  The Lariat fracas is a small part of a large drama, but it is emblematic of an essential feature of the gay-marriage debate: the most salient divisions are not religious, political, or cultural but generational. To talk to younger people is to realize that for most of them, including many young conservatives, such notions as the idea that homosexuality is shameful, that it is a voluntary and/or contagious life-style choice, or that it is some sort of threat to something or other (public order, the family, civilization, God) are simply bizarre curios from the past, like the belief that masturbation causes blindness. And, for what its worth, anecdotal impressions are confirmed by opinion research. One particularly striking CBS News/New York Times poll, taken last year, asked respondents if they would favor or oppose a law that would allow homosexual couples to marry, giving them the same legal rights as other married couples. Among adults under age thirty, 61 per cent said they would favor such a law and 35 per cent said they would oppose it; among sixty-five-year-olds and up, 18 per cent were in favor and 73 per cent opposed. The numbers vary from poll to poll, but the huge age gap is always there.  The trend lines are clear: at some point in the fairly near futuremaybe by the time those twenty-somethings are forty-somethingsgay marriage will be routine. (So will gay divorce, if the experience of straight marriage is any guide.) As for the legal status of homosexual unions, we are smack in the middle of a period of creative chaos. Family law has always been messy in this country, with marriages that are lawful in one state being unlawful in the next. Now its just messier. Some legislatures are passing laws forbidding gay marriage, others are experimenting with civil unions, still others are doing both; mayors, in acts of what might be called civic disobedience, are presiding at gay weddings; courts are issuing dicta for every taste. Last week, it was the turn of New York States crackerjack attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who threaded the needle deftly by announcing that while it remains illegal for gays to get married in New York, gay marriages performed legally elsewhere are legal here, too.   There is ferment aplenty. But none of it exceeds the tolerances of Americas ramshackle federal mechanism. When divisions are rampant, passions on all sides are high, and no one on any side is suffering any palpable harm, the naturaland not necessarily reprehensibleinclination of politicians is to straddle. That is what Senator Kerry has been doing, and until recently it was what President Bush had been doing, too. But then the Presidents poll numbers dropped, and his religious-right baseunsatiated, apparently, by the Administrations record of crippling stem-cell research, packing the courts with troglodytes, funding faith-based services, and defunding family planninggrew restive.  The best that can be said for Bushs sudden call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is that, on some level, he seems ashamed of it. He went to the Roosevelt Room, delivered his prepared statement, and left without taking questions. The Times reported that White House officials thought that the President appeared uncomfortable. Vice-President Cheney, whose beloved daughter is openly gay, said stoically a few days later that he will support his President, but he could not quite bring himself to say that he thinks the amendment itself is a good idea.  It is close to a certainty that no such amendment will be adopted. There simply arent enough people who see gay marriage as a sufficiently dire threat to the welfare of children, the stability of society, and the most fundamental institution of civilization (the Presidents words) so that writing bigotry into the Constitution itself is urgently required. Bush probably doesnt believe that, and Cheney certainly doesnt. Theyre just trying to win an election, and they figure that the end justifies the means. Well learn in November whether their ploy was successful. Either way, the question posed in all sweet innocence by the student editors of the Baylor Lariat will remain: Shouldnt gay couples be allowed to enjoy the benefits and happiness of marriage, too?   Hendrik Hertzberg    ironically, the gay folk that i know personally claim to have no interest in marriage........however, after a recent jolt to status quo, i am certain that their level of commitment is every bit as solid as those married 15 + years..........

      ok, so mm has read an insightful article in this week's new yorker.......cut and pasted for your enlightenment........  Last week, while the critics, the clergy, and the professional opinion-providers were caught up in the opening, on Ash Wednesday, of The Passion of the Christ, it seemed a good idea to ask Elaine Pagels, a renowned historian of the early Christian period, to see the film and offer her reaction. Scholarship on the quick, admittedly. Professor Pagels, who teaches at Princeton and is the author of The Gnostic Gospels and The Origin of Satan, seemed hesitant at first. But one evening she viewed The Passion with some friends, and afterward she called to say that she was, well, disturbed. And not just because of the unremitting and brutal flaying of Christ, though my friends said that anyone who had really endured that kind of torture would have been dead a lot earlier in the movie.  Pagels is both a scholar and, in her way, a practicing Christian. Usually, she is measured, soft-spoken, but there was the slightest tone of agitation in her voice: Its important to remember that this is Lent, and meditations on the Passion of Christ are an important part of the cultural interpretation of human suffering. Theres a context for the movie in the history of art. When Christians read the Gospels as historical acts, they will say what Mel Gibson says: that this is the truth, this is our faith. But the important thing is that this film ignores the spin the gospel writers were pressured to put on their works, the distortions of facts they had to execute. Mel Gibson has no interest whatsoever in that.  Pagels explained that the four gospel writers of the New Testament probably wrote between 70 and 100 A.D. These were the years following the Roman defeat of the Jews, which left the Temple and the center of Jerusalem in ruins. Acts of sedition by the Jews against their conquerors were met with swift execution. As a result, Pagels said, the Gospels, which were intended not as history but as preaching, as religious propaganda to win followers for the teachings of Christ, portrayed the conflict of the Passion as one between Jesus and the Jewish people, led by Caiaphas. And, though it was the Roman occupiers, under Pontius Pilate, who possessed ultimate political and judicial power in Judea, they are described in the Gospelsand, more starkly, in Gibsons film--as relatively benign.   Our first informed comment on Pilate comes from Philo of Alexandria, a wealthy, influential Jewish citizen who was part of a delegation sent to Rome to negotiate with the emperor, Pagels said. The delegation saw the Emperor Caligula in the year 40, seven to ten years after Jesus death, and Philo writes that Pilate was stubborn and cruel and routinely ordered executions without trial. The other great historian of the period is Josephus, who wrote the history of the war between the Romans and the Jews. He tells us many episodes about Pilate that also go against what the Gospels tell usthat he robbed the public treasury, that he deliberately incited the Jerusalemites. Josephus tells us that when people rioted in protest Pilate sent his soldiers to beat and kill them. So he was far from the man depicted in the Gospels.   Mel Gibson denies any anti-Semitism, and I cant speak to his motives, Pagels went on, but there are narrative devices that are clear. The more benign Pilate appears in the movie, the more malignant the Jews are. To deflect responsibility from the Romans for arresting and executing Christ, which Gibson takes from the Gospels and makes even more extreme, is contrary to everything we understand about history. It is implausible that the Jews could be responsible and Pilate a benign governor. There are many examples in the film of a preposterous dialectic: the bad Jews and the good Romans. When the Temple police arrest Jesus, Mary Magdalene turns to the Romans as if they were the policemen on the block, benign protectors of the public order. But the very idea of a Jewish woman turning to Roman soldiers for help is ridiculous.  Unlike many of the critics, Pagels was hesitant about analyzing what effect The Passion of the Christ would have on its audiences. But her tone was one of regret.  Pagels pointed out that the history of western art is rife with representations of the Passion that avoid divisive sentiment. In the St. Matthew Passion, she said, Bach was very aware of the problem of arousing anti-Semitic feelings and he wanted deliberately to avoid that. So at the moment when there is the cry to crucify Christ, the call comes not from an identifiable group of Jews but from all, from the entire chorus. Bach demonstrated what Gibson claims that he wanted to show, the inclination of human beings, universally, to do violence. There were other artists, toofrom Palestrina to Bill Viola--who depicted the Passion in a similar spirit.  In the end, she said, Gibsons movie is no more subtle than The Lord of the Rings. There is the side of good and the side of evil.   David Remnick  on the other hand, the new yorker also ran a piece about yeardley smith, the voice-over actress who 'plays' lisa simpson in the long-running animated series.........lisa is someone who doesn't just pay lipservice to taking the high moral road, she has done so through her actions in every episode since 1988 (or so.....)........several who have encouraged me to see the  mel movie this week spoke of how real and true it was on the screen.....yet have no clue about the actual message of love, acceptance, commitment, and faith...........actions will always speak louder than words...or brutal flaying scenes........

      ok, so the big news in the danville restaurant millieu was about freddie's......whose female owner has filed a restraining order against her spouse/erstwhile partner.....and has moved to arizona with her child to live out her days........she has an inoperable tumor on her heart, and has not been given much hope since she returned from the mayo clinic.......since she is credited as being the brains behind that operation........not much hope is given to this classic downtown danville eatery.........which still has those lovely chrome pedastal seats in front of the counter........i am putting together a book of digital photos/recipes/serving descriptions for my partner...for him to use spring break, and in case i am ever hit by a bus..........i have only missed 3-4 days in 4 years of operation..........my travels have been while we have been while wew were closed................so i must prepare for the worst case scenario.....that he must make the quiches/crepes/chicken artichoke pies.........etc.................speaking of travels....i am livid that my return trip from france on air france did not yield any delta airmiles............i thought they were partners...........of course, this return flight was ever so much more pleasant than delta would have been..it was an airbus plane with in-seat video...i watched 3 marvelous films...including the quiet american with brendan frasier that is on my book club list..........now i will not bother to read the book because i haven't the time and the film was so good.........not that the flight was worth 4500 or so airmiles.......i am close to another free trip.....and this is a major set-back..................

      ok, so we have an extra dog, now that my mother is on an extended tour of western states/friends/kin...........and this additional dog is already on my last nerve.......partly because our older dog, a wired-haired terrier, has developed some joint/ligament problems, and the younger, portly yellow lab has been getting into numerous neighbor-dog's food, and making himself sick by the time he gets back home..........the extra dog has been poorly 'trained'..............enough said..........it has only been 48 hours................

      ok, so there is something to be said for women who have not brains enough to have scruples...................from cnn.com.......  Jessica's Political Favors They say politics makes strange bedfellows, but when does "strange" veer off into "wacky"? Here's the answer: Preternaturally perky starlet Jessica Simpson is pals with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, one of the least perky government officials ever, reports Us Weekly. And the "Newlyweds" star plans to exploit their friendship for all it's worth (value still to be determined).  Joe Simpson, Jessica's exceedingly involved dad and manager, tells the mag that he's asked Rumsfeld to cameo as himself on his daughter's still-untitled ABC sitcom pilot ('cause when we think comedy, we think Rumsfeld). Another Republican asked to appear: California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. "We're friends with Donald Rumsfeld and with Schwarzenegger," Joe explains, adding that he hopes they'll agree to "tongue-in-cheek" interviews with Mrs. Nick Lachey's TV reporter character. The Simpsons are also pursuing Donald Trump, who owes them a sit-down as payback for subjecting Jessica to Omarosa's antics on "The Apprentice."

      ok, so i copied this from mpr......harper lee was a chi omega, by the way...........  It's the birthday of the woman who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird (1960), Harper Lee, (books by this author) born Nelle Harper in Monroeville, Alabama (1926). She grew up in Monroeville, which had a population of about 7,000, and it was the model for the town of Maycomb in To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee wrote, "It was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum."  Her father was a lawyer, and she spent much of her free time hanging around the courthouse and playing golf with the children of other lawyers. She thought it seemed like a pretty good way to live, and for a long time she wanted to be a lawyer when she grew up. She went to law school at the University of Alabama, and after she graduated she worked as a reservation clerk for an airline in New York City. She spent all day at work, and then came home to write for four hours every evening. In the mid '50s, Lee started working on a novel about the trial of a black man in a small town in Alabama.   In December of 1956, she wasn't able to get back to Alabama to celebrate Christmas with her family, so instead she celebrated with a family she knew in Manhattan. On Christmas morning, Lee and the family gathered around the tree to open gifts. Most of them were for the children of the family, but when everything under the tree had been unwrapped, the parents asked Lee to open an envelope that was resting on the branches. Inside was a note that said, "You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas." The couple gave her a loan to devote an entire year to nothing but writing, and it was during that year that Lee wrote most of the first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird.  She sent the manuscript to a publisher in New York, and they told her that it had potential but that it was too much like a collection of short stories and not enough like a novel. She spent the next two and a half years rewriting it, and To Kill A Mockingbird was published in July of 1960. It was priced at $3.95, and it sold more than two and a half million copies in less than a year. It was selected by the Reader's Digest book club, the Literary Guild book club, and the Book-of-the-Month Club; and it was immediately published in more than a dozen languages. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.   To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of Atticus Finch, a lawyer who defends a black man named Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white girl. The title of the novel comes from something Finch says to his daughter: "Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."  To Kill a Mockingbird sells about a million copies every year, and it's sold over thirty million copies since its publication. In 1963, just three years after its publication, it was taught in eight percent of U.S. public middle schools and high schools, and today that figure is closer to eighty percent. Only Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and Huckleberry Finn are assigned more often.

      ok, so my friend gail presented me with a key to her car this morning as soon as she walked into work......which would seem like an unusual move, unless you had been at work with gail for the past week.........when her keys were locked in her car, either here at at her house....off and on for 7 days...........monday morning, the midst of a full-throttle thunder storm, she called me at work....kathy, come get me......i locked my keys in my car again..............she found a ride home on monday, and another ride to work on tuesday......finally shw convinced the father of her children to come over from harrodsburg and open her door (she bought her car from him........) ..........then by thursday she had locked the keys inside again, at work....in our lot......and she got the father of her children to come over again to get them out.........so by sunday, when we were serving a baby shower.......and she came in to me and said.....you'll never believe what i have done................well, i knew exactly what she had done......................she finally got a locksmith to come and pop her lock............bless her heart..............

      ok, so mm's garden, usually a source of solace has been a disappointment this season.........not for the current show of phlox, poppies, iris, money plant, iberis, etc, but for the cloud of doom that hangs over it and dampens my enthusiasm for improvements........the septic system contractor has not yet drawn the definitive plans for pipes, etc.....and so i do not know just which sections of established perennial beds will be utterly destroyed..........and thusly i just sit back and do nothing....no weeding, no mulching, no dreaming of plant movements that will enhance the color scheme. etc.........will i have to dig up rosa constance spry, or grandma broughton's old pink rose (my brother-in-law the rosarian thinks it might be called belladonna......)  and if i do have to dip up constance's bed, there are 5 other roses in that bed that will also have to moved......and to where?.............not every part of my yard has enough soil depth to grow roses..............nor enough sunlight, etc.............the plans include running the lateral lines into the 'wood' lot that blocks our view of the neighbors..........there is not much soil depth there either....which means that fill dirt will have to be trucked in..............hopefully the wildflowers are numerous enough to prevent extinction if the lines and dirt end up on top of a few.........it is just the principle of the thing at this point......so much flora, so much potential for a moonscape at this address.....i am depressed...............

      ok, so today's sunday school lesson dealt with john chapter 21 verses 1-19....a passage that includes the following 'that disciple whom jesus loved said to peter, it is the lord...'  we had quite a discussion about the disciple that jesus loved.......john is the only gospel writer that mentions this unnamed person.......most notably in chapter 21 when peter asks jesus about his relationship with the beloved disciple and jesus tells him to mind his own business........on-line references were varied........there is a gay christian website named the beloved disciple.....this option had already occured to me........how do we know that jesus was heterosexual.........we don't..............there was a web mention of the beloved being john the guy who wrote the gospel......kind of like......jesus loved me best.........and then there was the mary magdeline theory.....some guy from egypt identified mary as the beloved in the second century.......of course, i like the mary magdeline theory.....why couldn't jesus' beloved be a woman?...........this really makes sense in davinci code terms.......peter took over the church, and peter black-washed mary as a prostitute or worse.......some jealousies run deeper than faith...........anyway, there was a person in my sunday school class, raised catholic but now southern baptist, who took great umbrage at this notion...............she even admitted that she was having a hard time finishing the davinci code because she could not get by the 'fiction' ............at the very least, the gospels are themselves fictions..........personally edited accounts that leave in and leave out details based on an agenda of some sort..........for us to say that the gospels are the truth, without taking this reality into account is simple-minded............does that mean that i lack faith.....not at all, in the same way that martin luther did not lack faith when he had the courage to go up against the catholic church over ethical issues.............oh my......at this late date i am so amazed to find that there are people who take everybit of information that comes along as 'gospel' and do not feel empowered to question any of it...........

      ok, so when mm noted in the previous blog that she was not much of a sports fan, she completely forgot about bicycle racing...............every july i sit with my spouse and watch taped coverage of each stage (the only reason we would ever get cable would be to have open access to oln, which airs bicycle racing........but as long as my mother has a sattelite dish and is willing to tape these programs.........)anyway, last night we watched coverage of the tour of georgia, where part of the us postal team is racing........and highlights of other european classics (paris-rubaix, etc.)..........lance is not the only american that races.....there is also george hincappie, bobby julich, levi leipheimer to name a few........though none except george race with lance......they race with other teams in hopes of being the top dog and supported in bids for stage wins........lance's #2 guy from last year, roberto heras, is now with his own team, and will surely give lance a run for his money this year........the other nice thing about watching taped segments?...we can ff through the commercials..........

      ok, so the supreme court denied a request from maurice clarett, and presumedly from his mamma as well.....to allow him to participate in the nfl draft this weekend.............gentle readers who may not be OSU fans.....maurice clarett led the OSU BUCKEYES to their recent national championship...as a freshman....and then his career when down the tubes from there...........he and his mamma were involved in some sort of financial scandal...which got him kicked out of osu because such things are verboten with the ncaa.................he then started into litigation with the nfl with regards to the draft 'early'.............like 2 years early................this fellow is a tad older than acw............who is a true sophomore in college as opposed to someone who may not actually know the way to class on OSU's campus...........no matter what they say.........OSU football players do not attend class.............I was in a psychology class with Archie Griffin's younger brother...and he never showed up..............I would bet the farm that he got a passing grade..........anyway, back to maurice clarett..............who was 'lent' money by a football booster....and the money was spent by his mamma on who know's what......one oculd argue that OSU corrupted him, with promises of riches despite the ncaa rules............but it looks like he and his mamma got greedy, and now they may have lost all that they counted on........................ha! so many young black athletes have this fantasy that they will strike it rich in the pros....and so they neglect their lessons......and go downhill from there..........i saw about 6 of dhs's finest football players walking to school yesterday, after dropping off scw..........not one had a backpack...which means not one found the time to do any homework...........or felt inclined to read the lessons.............ironic, as scw had a backpack filled to the point that his french ap novel and the accompanying french dictionary were in hand because there was no other room in the zippered compartments..............so I say...too bad, maurice clarett..................you blew it....the scholarship...the classes you likely did not attend.....the team you thought were too good to play with......and now you are lucky to find a job in columbus saying............'do you want fries with that?'...................

      ok, so i really like this poem by cecilia woloch  Slow Children at Play  All the quick children have gone inside, called by their mothers to hurry-up-wash-your-hands honey-dinner's-getting-cold, just-wait-till-your-father-gets-home-- and only the slow children out on the lawns, marking off paths between fireflies, making soft little sounds with their mouths, ohs that glow and go out and glow. And their slow mothers flickering, pale in the dusk, watching them turn in the gentle air, watching them twirling, their arms spread wide, thinking, These are my children, thinking, Where is their dinner? Where has their father gone?   there is a sign on our circle that says slow children at play............which is only slightly true, as the only cayle and lena are at the age of play....the others are under age 2 and don't get out much..............as for whether they are slow children is anybody's guess .....and as for me being a slow mother...................

      ok, so the plethora of new grey hairs that plagued my spring break trip seem to have receded (no pun intended)....and i appear to back to the usual hair color...who knew that driving 2000 miles would turn a few hairs grey?  since this episode i have been more attune to hair color/growing out of hair color............and frankly, it does not appear to be useful in the long run to color grey............so many women i have noticed do not quite keep up with this covering of grey, and therefore look worse than they might have looked...........i am amused to read on line that there is a group offering a 'voice' lift to those who feel that the aging process has somehow affected voice quality..............hahahaha........should my voice sound too old to certain listeners..........there are many hand gestures that speak volumes with a meaning that remains ageless.............

      ok, so between cayle's soccer game, and a few moments spent on the deck reading the newspaper, i have come up with a nasty sunburn on my face, lower arms, and neck...........oh, my......i did not see this coming on a day that wasn't all that hot.........my face is so red it even hurts when i look at myself in the mirror.............

      ok, so last night the mm took advantage of an opportunity to find closure and peace with her brother-in-law........the one she has not seen in 2 solid years....not since the unfortunate probating of her mother-in-law's will 2 years ago.................i was really pleased to see him at my sister-in-law's house.....and my first words to him were genuine................i told him that i was most sad when osu won the national football championship, and i did not feel welcome to call him to relish in the success..............he gave me a big hug, and told me that he celebrated for both of us..............and that he also celebrated when xavier made it to the round of 8...........................family distress is more than distressing...............it is downright disabling.....................even when it is not quite your family..................

      ok, so on the way back from cincinnati this morning, we listened to nickel creek, a bluegrass trio produced my alison krauss............they are quite good, with fiddle, mandolin, and guitar...........anyway...they played a song about tom bombadil..................which may seem natural to those literati who have actually read the tolkein trilogy...............sadly, neither my spouse nor my daughter had read the books...and therefore had no idea about tom bombadil.......................i can recall...the first time i got wind that someone was filming the trilogy.................i looked online to see who was to play tom bombadil............i am still dismayed that this character was left out......................he and his lovely companion represent all that is good and earthy about this life we lead..............and peter jackson decided that he would rather spend hisd on-screen time on orcs and falling wizard flashbacks................ah well.................

      ok, so the mm is proud of her child who was accepted for the annual ky governor's scholar's program, that will take place for 5 wweks this summer at either centre college, eku, or bellermine.............there has been much press about our republican governor's failure to pass a budget in this session, and that there may not be funding for governor's scholars.......scw's acceptance letter even mentions the possibility of no money..................this acceptance also carries with it the reality of a 4-year full-ride to u.k.................should scw want a full-ride at u.k............frankly, I don't see u.k. as the premier school for romance languages.................... therefore my child has my permission to pursue other options...............

      ok, so today is isak dinesen's birthday......and her life was so tragic.......she fell in love with the son of a count, but he refused to marry her, so she married his twin brother as a way to get revenge..........and from him she caught a std.........and left her on her own in their african coffee plantation...............where she wrote the stories that would become out of africa.................when hemingway won the nobel prize for literature, he commented that the prize should have gone to her...........a quote i appreciate..........Dinesen said, "All sorrows can be borne, if you put them into a story."

      ok, so mm so enjoyed listening to books on tape during the trip up east, that she has gone out and gotten yet another one to listen to whilst walking/working.............this one is a sequel of sorts to the talented mr ripley, by patricia highsmith...........i had not realized that she wrote several books using my ripley as her imperfect hero......so far, this book is quite good, especially since i have seen the movie and know what preceded this book, both the good and the bad...............

      ok, so the mm just got back from catering a 'casual' event at the home of a local 'doyenne', whose pre-civil war home has slave quarters in the backyard.........we arrived 1 hour early to set up.........and were greeted with dismay that we brought no appetizers.......gentle readers....be aware that no appetizers, nor coffee, nor any else other than 2 casseroles, salad, bread, soft drinks, and cookies were requested................anyway........when we were set up and waiting for guests, the hostess starting in talking about the slave quarters out back, and reminisced 'chauncey(her late spouse)  used to say that he was the last slave on this plantation'....................she then turned to gail, my friend and coworder, and said.....'i imagine you know all about that'...................there was a long pause...........as gail is black...and whether or not she knows all about that is her business.......i could not believe that our hostess would say such a thing..............well, yes i can believe it, because she gets by saying worse to so many people..............anyway, at 8:00 pm, the only people there were her paid housecleaners (working overtime) and us.....we waited until 9:00.....in case someone might come late.......finally, the hostess asked me why i was so anxious to leave.....i replied that i was concerned that gail was ill, and i wanted to get her home.........................actually, gail had mentioned in passing that she has an upset stomach, and i just ran with it.................i will remember this ploy in future, gentle readers..............

      ok, so the mm took time out today to email abc to complain that 1) alias was pre-empted by nick and jessica's comedy hour and 2) nick and jessica's comedy hour was a tragic rehash of sonny and cher, which was pretty stupid the first time around.........at one point i was certain that poor jessica was lip-synching her love ballad/tribute to her spouse........and i was also afraid that her breasts would explode from so much pumping up..........yes.....i will admit that the mm is quite the little alias fan...........but really.......nick and jessica?

      ok, so last night we got together with some book club people and watched the quiet american, starring michael cain and brendan fraiser.......a chilling tale of american duplicity in the years leading up to the viet nam war......one of our group mentioned a quote that npr had recently featured....by ho chi min (sp)........he was asked how he thought that he could beat the best army on earth....he replied.......they will kill many of us....we will kill some of them......and they will tire of it first.............i have pondered this quote today as i read of still more u.s. casualities.....yes, we will tire of it first when the cause is not just.......at princeton, yale, and harvard, we saw entire rooms filled with the names of war dead...cicvil war....wwI and wwII....korea.........the lists of names got really lean when the viet nam war was remembered........an unjust war that few were willing to die for....................the politics of iraq, the factions are so intractable that we were complete fools to think that we could just bring in democracy and think it would 'take', like fabric takes dye................we need gwbush to fade into the sunset this november............

      ok, so here are the best and worst things about middlebury college...in no particular order...  Best things  1. language program is tops......campus has a french 'house' called the chateau for french majors  2. two thirds of students study abroad...language majors are expected to study abroad   3. the student body is especially left-leaning politically........4. students/campus administration is dedicated to recycling......even unsorted trash is sorted after pickup to remove recyclables .....5.  students clearly love this place...when we arrived too late for the tour...we kind of hung around reading literature.....and a tour guide who had finished with her group saw us looking forlorn...and offered to take us around herself...she even picked up a family of three she saw looking around on campus.......that kind of hospitality/loyalty is telling of the way students must be treated by staff/faculty/administration  Worst things  1.  this college is at best 19 hours from car, and not only is it not near any cut-rate southwest hub, it is at least 45 minutes from any airport in an area where there are no public transportation options.....2. this college is located in an area that still had traces of snow in early april........my child tends to lose things like coats, gloves, etc....he will surely freeze to death......3. security seemed  lax.......our guide took us into her dorm and into her room........and there were no locked doors of any kind...no key pads.....no infra-red sensors......no codes.......though there are security guards that know the student body, there seemed to be an openness that appeared too trusting in these troubled times.....4. cell phones are out of range until you get closer to the new york state line.......5. some dorms don't offer upper classman housing, even though students are expected to live in their dorms 4 years.......i may have misunderstood, but that is what i think i heard.......

      ok, so in our easter sunday school literature, the following poem was synopsized.............  Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front   by Wendell Berry  Love the quick profit, the annual raise, vacation with pay. Want more  of everything ready-made. Be afraid  to know your neighbors and to die.  And you will have a window in your head.  Not even your future will be a mystery  any more. Your mind will be punched in a card  and shut away in a little drawer.   When they want you to buy something  they will call you. When they want you  to die for profit they will let you know.  So, friends, every day do something  that won't compute. Love the Lord.  Love the world. Work for nothing.  Take all that you have and be poor.  Love someone who does not deserve it.   Denounce the government and embrace  the flag. Hope to live in that free  republic for which it stands.  Give your approval to all you cannot understand. Praise ignorance, for what man  has not encountered he has not destroyed.   Ask the questions that have no answers.  Invest in the millenium. Plant sequoias.  Say that your main crop is the forest  that you did not plant,  that you will not live to harvest.   Say that the leaves are harvested  when they have rotted into the mold. Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.  Put your faith in the two inches of humus  that will build under the trees  every thousand years.   Listen to carrion -- put your ear  close, and hear the faint chattering  of the songs that are to come.  Expect the end of the world. Laugh.  Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful  though you have considered all the facts.  So long as women do not go cheap  for power, please women more than men.   Ask yourself: Will this satisfy  a woman satisfied to bear a child?  Will this disturb the sleep  of a woman near to giving birth?   Go with your love to the fields.  Lie down in the shade. Rest your head  in her lap. Swear allegiance  to what is nighest your thoughts.   As soon as the generals and the politicos  can predict the motions of your mind,  lose it. Leave it as a sign  to mark the false trail, the way  you didn't go.   Be like the fox  who makes more tracks than necessary,  some in the wrong direction.  Practice resurrection.   "Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front" from The Country of Marriage, copyright  1973 by Wendell Berry, reprinted by permission of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc.    just thought you would enjoy this take on easter.............

      ok, so the mm has readers of exquisite taste.......the following was part of an email.....  Hi Kathy, I was thinking about your plot problem if you lose the Oprah idea...(who knows why one's mind latches onto things?).  Anyway, I was thinking that if your protagonist wins the lottery (or do two people win the lottery together or does the whole cafe staff split the pot...) that it allows the introduction of a writer character who wants to interview them to do either a movie script or a sit-com/drama pilot  This allows stories to be told in sequence through multiple meetings, offers your characters opportunities to mull over what is made public vs. what is part of private life and keeps you from having to tell the whole thing within a one-time interview.   Has anyone written an e-mail correspondence novel yet? (Like the epistolary form, but short and ungrammatical.)  Anyway, I have no ambitions to write anything more than an occasional note or letter, so more power to you.     I really wish that i had thought of that story line myself..............

      ok, so today there are two poets in my minds....for starts...(from mpr)today is the birthday of poet Walt Whitman, born in West Hills, Long Island, New York (1819). He grew up in Brooklyn, and lived in New York City for most of his life. He began working as a printer's assistant from a very young age, and in the '40s and '50s he worked for a series of newspapers in Brooklyn and Manhattan. It was in New York City, in 1855, that Whitman published the first edition of his poetry collection Leaves of Grass. He couldn't find anyone to publish it for him, so he sold a house and used the money to publish it himself. There was no publisher's name or author's name on the cover, just a picture of Whitman himself. He wrote the poems in a new style, a kind of free verse without rhyme or meter. He said in one preface to the book, "Here are the roughs and beards and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the soul loves."   Leaves of Grass got mostly bad reviews, but Ralph Waldo Emerson called it "the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Whitman printed Emerson's comment on the second edition of the book, and he wrote an anonymous review of it himself, hoping to spark sales. Whitman continued to add poems to Leaves of Grass and publish it in different editions throughout his life. It eventually went through nine different editions; Whitman compared the finished book to a cathedral that took years to build, or a tree with visible circles of growth. In the 1880s the Society for the Suppression of Vice called it immoral in a Boston newspaper, and that's when it finally started to sell. Whitman used the money to buy a cottage in Camden, where he spent the rest of his life.   the other poet called to mind today is theodore ohara, of danville, ky, who wrote the poem memorialized on the marker in the courthouse 'park'.....                               urlLink THE BIVOUAC OF THE DEAD "By Theodore O'Hara         		       The muffled drums sad roll has beat                         		The soldier's last Tattoo;                     		No more on life's parade shall meet                         		That brave and fallen few.

      ok, the my general meanness came into question last night at dinner, when i refused to let our daughter have a second huge helping of lasagna after she had already eaten a first huge helping, 2 pieces of bread.......and no salad.......yes, she could have salad.....but she had no business with extra lasagna....the meanness came up when the discussion of 'growing girls' was brought forth........our daughter, at age 11, has probably grown all that she will grow...given her current state of puberty.......at this mention....she burst into hysterics, spent time 'on the steps' cooling off.......and only later was calm enough to read on-line about the stages of growth in puberty, and associated milestones.......fortunately the article from nih stated tnat many girls have reached their full adult height by age 11........gentle readers.....this child, who was neglected as a young child to the point that she had no predictable availability of food has a problem with food.....if there are servings left in bowls on the table.....particularly of meat or starch...never with vegetables...go figure......she feels compelled to eat them.......we were stunned when she used a leftover roll to wipe out her ice cream bowl one day last week......she said she was still hungry and nobody else had wanted that roll.......given the fine line between allowing a child to become obese, and creating an eating problem.....i must tread carefully here......we do know that heaviness runs in her biological family.....she is not yet in this state...but she has quite a potential to become so......pray for us all here in this household, that we may make it through this child's adolescence.........

      ok, so let us no forget women who fought bravely/served in battle on this memorial day weekend.....the photos i have seen thus far of vets arriving in washington dc for the wwII memorial were men......women in combat have an unlikely heroine to look up to...it was on this day in 1431 that Joan of Arc was burned at the stake for heresy in Rouen, France. She was an ordinary French peasant girl, living during the Hundred Years War between France and England. When she was still a teenager, she heard the voice of God telling her to join the battle and help defeat the English army. She performed a series of apparent miracles and persuaded the French army to let her command a group of soldiers. At the battle of Orleans, she led the revitalized French army, bearing a flag with Jesus name written across it, and the English were defeated. She continued fighting battles until May 23, 1430, when she was captured by enemy soldiers. They turned her over to the church to be tried as a heretic, idolater, and sorcerer. Her enemies believed that the only way they could have lost in battle to a woman was if she had been using witchcraft. She was mostly forgotten for about 400 years, and then she was revived as a patriotic figure during the French revolution. In 1920 she was canonized as a saint by Pope Benedict the Fifteenth. She is the only person ever burned at the stake for heresy who later became a saint. The file on her at the Vatican is still sealed. joan really must have been incredible......many movies made of her, but now when i think of joan, , i see eowyn with helmet on and sword in hand...standing up to the witch king.......with the truly great screen line......i am no man........which she pronounces just before destroying him.........curious that the vatican would have kept joan's file sealed.......joan of arc: the secret vatican file sounds like a good movie concept.....

      ok, so having seen lotr/rotk once on the big screen and twice on tv via dvd......i would have done things differentlty if i were queen of the universe and could control the editing of epic sagas.......for starts, i would drastically cut back on the frodo/sam/gollum scenes........they really weighed things down in all three installments....one or two scenes would have sufficed with regards to gollum trying to make frodo distrust sam...........and one or two scenes of sam and frodo climbing anything....the steps to the spider lair.....or mount doom......... could have conveyed the same weighty sense of adversity, duty, survival.......also, i would cut out the scene at minas trias (sp)where frodo is in bed recovering and all his friends come into greet him, one by one.....this could have been melded with the coronation scene.......and saved time......on a similar note, i feel that the romance between faromir and eowyn that was played out in the book should have been fleshed out in the film.........and the ending......i.e...everything after the coronation...could have waited til the extended version........i have read all 4 books (including the hobbit) numerous times.....and i do not think i would have felt slighted if the text had been shortcut a tad for the sake of telling a story well, versus telling the entire story whether it turned out well or not.......it would be good to be queen.......

      ok, so mm has regressed to past favorites........at least with books on tape.....the library was quite wanting in anything that interested me, so i checked out a classic....northanger abbey by jane austin......probably her novel that i am the least familiar with......so far....jane has used the word insipid twice.....and we are only to chapter 3........gentle readers.........some words may be used over and over....connectors, etc.....but other descriptives screamout from overuse.......jane has used the word sallow at least three times......i am being overly critical, i allow......i may simply overlook repeat use when i read,but when one listens.....such things are more easily noticed.......a curious development, as my close aquaintance asure me that i hear nothing they say to me.............

      ok, so there are many rages on the mm's plate this evening........for starts.....i made a 'quick trip' to frankfort to obtain our chilled....fedex quails...that fedex could not deliver due to lack of staff........gentle readers....there are few calls as unwelcome as the food vendor...who calls on friday afternoon to tell you that your quails are in frankfort......3 counties away....and that they have no drivers to deliver them....and that you will have to locate the frankfort fedex office yourself and go there.......the food rep says this from his in-laws house in henderson....near st. louis...so we all know he isn't going to frankfort to get the quails.........and the company that sent the quails also called....so sorry that they used fedex instead if ups....which is 4 blocks away....i could have walked there.........so i got in my van.....full of recycling, by the way....and drove to frankfort using directions i found online.....and drove back.........there was construction at the bluegrass parkway exit.....which delayed my return by 30 minutes.......so by the time i got home i was good and upset..........and then.....i discovered that my good friend...the loyal opposition.....had lifted text from my blog onto her own blog.......i was flattered....and wanted to use this trackback feature that appeared when i added comments to my new format......1.5 hours later......i have downloaded software, read instructions, disclaimers, blah, blah, blah....and still do not know how to link the l.o's borrowed text to my text........i did figure out how to upload photographs,....but that was not on a holiday friday afternoon........which brings me to my third rage.....i have 2 weddings tomorrow....and i have to work........who in their right mind wants to get married on a day that i do not want to work?...............

      ok, so i didn't get much sleep last night...mostly due to the storms......there were at least 2 that swept through with sheets of rain, howling winds....the works.......someone had to lay awake and decide if things were bad enough to warrant going to the basement.......but today.......i am pretty worthless........scotty, my kitchen assistant....told me that the storms kept him awake, too....but he had no where to go.....as he and his family of 5 live in a trailer park.......the coverstory in the lexheraldleader was of a trailer completely destroyed by the tornado that came through yesterday south of here......very scary to live in a trailer......more storms are expected monday......maybe a good time to catch up on sleep with a nice afternoon nap.....

      ok, so my spouse came home yesterday jazzed up about a customer who came in for a bike with his new wife........who is from romania.......gentle readers.....my spouse's grandmother came from romania when she was 14 or so with her younger sister( the ages changed with the telling of the story.....but they must have been young)......to cincinnati, where they cleaned houses until they had enough money to get married........anyway......my spouse asked the romanian bride if she was familiar with the 'hometown' of timisoara....in northwestern romania......'timisoara...she replied....of course'......and then she turned to her new husband and asked him if my spouse did not have the complexion of a romanian.....in all fairness......my spouse and his siblings mostly have ruddy complexions.....and his oldest brother has distinct mongol traces......which makes sense given the history of the steppes.........we are amiss when we say...definitively...... that our kin are german...this branch was only german after WWI......before it was part of the austro-hungarian empire........they are actually romanian......and they should be proud of this connection.........

      ok, so.......today's blog is a tribute to martin luther...the original martin luther.....as reported on writer's almnanc  It was on this day in 1521 that the German priest and theologian Martin Luther was declared an outlaw by the Edict of Worms. The edict made Luther more of a hero than he already was, and it's a big reason that Protestantism caught on so quickly.   Luther decided to become a priest after getting caught out in a thunderstorm one night. He swore to God that if he survived he would enter the religious life. He did survive, and he went on to study theology, become ordained, and get a job as a professor in Wittenberg. As he became more and more involved in the Church, he began to grow disgusted with some of its practices. He was especially angry about the Church's sales of indulgences, which were said to decrease the time a person had to spend in Purgatory.   On the eve of All Saints Day in 1517, Luther posted ninety-five theses attacking the sale of indulgences to the door of his church. He wrote, "All those who consider themselves secure in their salvation through letters of indulgence will be eternally damned, and so will their teachers." There were thousands of peasants and pilgrims in town to observe All Saints Day, and the pamphlets caused a sensation. They were originally written in Latin, but they became so popular that people demanded they be translated into German, and so they were. Hundreds of copies were printed up on a printing press, which was still a fairly recent invention, and Luther's message spread throughout Germany and Europe.   Luther was threatened by church leaders, but he continued to publish controversial writings that attacked the church hierarchy. When the Pope issued an indictment of him, Luther burned a copy of it in a bonfire at his university. Religious leaders and politicians began to realize how dangerous he was becoming to the traditional church, and in April of 1521, a group of Roman princes pressured Emperor Charles V into forming an assembly to try to get Luther to reject his writings.   On his trip to Worms, Luther was celebrated as a hero at most of the towns he passed through. People hugged him and showered him with gifts, and he told them he would battle the Pope in Worms "though opposed by all the gates of hell and the powers of the air." When he arrived in Worms on April 16 he was cheered and welcomed by a crowd of people.  Luther had to appear twice before the emperor, and each time he was told to take back his teachings. He said, "Unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason . . . my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe."  Luther had a letter of safe conduct that gave him twenty-one days of safe travel through Germany, but as soon as he left the assembly he was declared an outlaw, which meant that he could be killed by anybody without the threat of punishment. He went into hiding in the Wartburg, where he grew out his hair and beard. Within a year, he moved back to Wittenberg, which had become the center of the Protestant Reformation.

      ok, so our daughter was promoted to the 6th grade today......which means that we have at least 7 more years of hands-on parenting left before our nest is empty........this event was idyllic in many ways.......my spouse and i walked there......in itself a rarity in all but small-town america....and as we walked a former classmate of acw's at montessori/dhs soccer ran across the street from the bakery to say hello and to say that he would be in the bike shop later on to get some parts, and to let us know that he has spent the year in jackson,wyoming working and mountain biking.......and, as we discovered, he almost worked at my favorite jackson restaurant....thai me up.......so we went to the promotion.....and cayle looked just fine considering that she has shoved her choice of dress into a kroger bag along with her shoes before leaving the house........it made no sense to ask her to take it on a hanger once it was already in the bag........the 'grads' camei in to the elementary gym to pomp and circumstance......and then we sang my old kentucky home.......and the students then sang the jenny rogers elementary school song.......and then cayle read her personal essay about her time at jenny rogers.......well. she was among 6 who reads their personal narrative.......and i was so pleased that she left out the part that she left montessori because she didn't fit in and couldn't figure it out.........and that her second grade teacher asked us why we were not medicating her........and the part about her having 3-4 women she calls mom........thankfully, she kept her remarks to the 1000 pound pig owned by the teacher she had last year.......such are the blessings of life...........

      ok so i thought i was done blogging, but there is always time for bush-bashing...  CNN) -- President Bush's approval rating remains virtually unchanged from the record low of his presidency two weeks ago, according to a new CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll.  Forty-seven percent of people polled May 21-23 said they approve of how Bush is handling the presidency -- up 1 percentage point from a poll taken May 7-9. (Full story)  Forty-nine percent said they disapprove, down 2 percentage points from the previous survey. With a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, the change was statistically   if only he could keep this up til november......but wait.....he probably can........

      ok, so there are lists of famous procrastinators........and this is the first person who overlapped with my leftie list......  Leonardo da Vinci Leonardo da Vinci was a man of incredible talent. He explored almost every field available to him, in both science and art. He made significant contributions in engineering, architecture, biology, botany, anatomy, math, and physics. He sculpted, painted, both portrait and mural (e.g., The Last Supper) and made plans for ingenious machines that wouldn't be built for centuries (e.g., planes, submarines). He also never finished a project on time.   Part of what made Leonardo such a "Renaissance Man" was that he was distractible as he was talented. Jacob Bronowski, the scientific historian, speaks about his procrastination. His talents and energy were often wasted in doodles and unfinished projects. The Last Supper was only finished after his patron threatened to cut off all funds. Mona Lisa took twenty years to complete.  The Adoration of the Magi, an early painting, was never finished and his equestrian projects were never built.   His procrastination caused him much grief in later years. Despite his varied contributions, he felt he could have achieved much more. Given his talents, it is without doubt that more of his aspirations could have become a reality in his own time. So much was half-completed that he appealed to God, Tell me if anything ever was done. Tell me if anything was done.  The cause of Leonardo's procrastination appears to be distractibility. Today, we might even characterize Leonardo as suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder. Being unable to focus on one project until completion is highly predictive of procrastination. His distractibility, jumping from topic to topic, allowed him to contribute in a wide variety of fields. However, it is doubtful whether such as strategy could create more than a dilettante today, even with Leonardo's ability (i.e., he was said to be able to paint with one hand and write with the other, simultaneously). Thanks to efforts over the last few hundred years, including da Vinci's of course, contributing new knowledge often requires many months of continued focus.

      ok, so there needs to be such a support group, for those of us who continue to be confused and confounded by handedness.......i am not alone, but these famous lefties are dead or not personally known to me, and of no real use to me in this crisis....ben franklin, joan of arc, alexander the great, charlemagne, julius caesar, napolean, josephine, queen victoria, prince charles and prince william, fidel castro, henry ford, helen keller, jfk jr, caroline kennedy, matt groening and therefore bart simpson, lewis carrol, mark twain, durer, davinci, escher, holbein, klee, michaelangelo, raphael, kurt cobain, paul simon, paul mccartney, jimi hendrix........in fact what stared this blog was a riff from purple haze.........which was the name of my high school newspaper........we were the purple indians, by the way, before using indians as team names was not politically correct........or rather, it was purple haze until someone caught on........which i did not understand at the time, being a tad naive to such things....but back to lefties.....it is good to have something in common with so many driven people.........curious, in that i have given up drivenness for lent and not taken it back up again.........but that may be why my middle child claims that i seem lost...i need to rediscover a passion for something vital.......again.....i think it should be my novel.......so why do i procrastinate so about working on it.....do i also have procrastination in common with all of these fine folks......... funny how i cannot find a similar list of famous procrastinators..........

      ok, so my good friend anne came in for lunch with her daughter who graduates dhs wednesday, and who will attend centre......with a notably liberal staff attended by basically southern semi-conservative students....the daughter promised to shake things up......but the best part of the few moments i could spend with them was simply reaffirming that i am not the only person who feels the way i do about life.......if anything, my friend anne is more liberal than i......and has probably gone to greater lengths to assure the free-thinking nature of her children (all 6).......and she is certainly the more vocal...with several ascerbic letters to the editor to her credit........but then, that is what i like about her........she is outspoken as well as unafraid to be so......

      ok, so my middle child will be away from home, attending governor's scholars program for 5 weeks.........at centre college.......in danville ky...which means we will drive him across town the end of june....and he will live in a dorm less than 2 blocks away from trc and dbf.......and we are only allowed 'on campus' to visit him for 1 single day in july..........however, both trc and dbf are within the legal limit that scholars may venture off campus......and he is allowed to attend church.....so theoretically he could be sitting in the pew with us/near us for 5 straight sundays.........and maybe show up for lunch on saturdays at the restaurant.......he will be studying russian language and culture...should be interesting....we will miss him.....luckily he has email access....and he can keep up with us via blog..........

      ok, so my spouse and i took a pleasant post-supper walk on the 5k cross country course at dr. mack's farm........this fine fellow has consigned most of his property to natural prairie with the support of a govt grant......so it is wild and wonderful......white yarrow is now in bloom, as is rosa multiflora.......a cultivar introduced as a hedgerow plant.......until it proved unable to stay in any hedgerow......at osu there was a specialist whose job it was to get rid of rosa multiflora.........anyway......our daughter's foster father and his 2nd bride married on this property last august.......in a lovely ceremony with a fabulous bluegrass band at the reception in a huge tent.........our friend larry and his wife cammie were there......we have a picture of them with our daughter under than tent.......sad memories along this walk........last night during dinner my husband and children got to talking about the u.u. church...and how danville needs one.......but then...dr. mack's 'services' every other sunday really count.....people gather for 1 hour of meditation and coffe...then hear a message by a volunteer............my sons suggested that the symbol of this loose gathering be dr. david anderson.......naked.....carrying the tablets under one arm, and a cup of free trade coffee in the other hand.........those who know david will find this quite fitting.........

Bush  (1924-    ) 41st Bill Clinton  (1946-    ) 42nd  why so many recent lefties......my mother would be the first to tell you that it was custom years ago to 'correct' handedness....and to force lefties into using their right hands.....my mother contends that she is really a leftie, but was forced otherwise.......i am shamed to be in the same group as reagan, bush #1 or ford.........oh my.......

      ok, so my eldest child came home last night to surprise my spouse on his 49th brithday.......we had an idyllic supper, with grandma, all the children home........well.. at least until the election came up and we spatted a bit over kerry 'talking out of both sides of his mouth', to which i countered that it was better than having cheney speaking for him out of his mute mouth like a blessed puppet...............anyway.......my eldest was just precious......chatting a mile a minute with our middle child......about who knows what...it was so good to see both children vibrant with excitement and focus........the eldest even said as much to me this afternoon before he went back to lexington.......'you, know mom, i didn't have anybody to talk to when i was in high school,.......and the people i hung around with...well i just did things i shouldn;'t have done..........i know what (scw) is going through......he doesn't have anybody to talk to.......he will when he goes to college.......'  such incite from a boy not yet 20.......i am so pleased that they have found each other as friends at this late date........

      ok, so among other awards, our middle child won the harvard prize book award.......presented by a harvard alum who is an english professor at centre...... As defined by the Harvard Alumni Association web site, the Prize Book is to be awarded to an outstanding student in the next to the graduating class who "combines excellence in scholarship and high character, with achievement in other fields." The award is usually made at the school's graduating exercises, with appropriate remarks by a local alumnus or alumna. The Prize Book may also be awarded to outstanding high school teachers, who inspire curiosity and excellence in students. the student we visited at harvard was the harvard prize book winner 2 years ago........so far, we have been deemed unworthy to actually look at the book........maybe there is a qualifying exam.......

      ok, so i went and got another one of those anonymous haircuts yesterday....a pretty good one, actually for the money......i am always amazed when i am asked if i want a wash as well as a cut.....the hairwashing part may be the very best part of a haircut........but i digress into fantasy....anyway......i got this song into my head.....beck's devil's haircut.....a catchy little tune that was blaring as we drove through northern germany on our way to amsterdam,...whilst i was really on the wrong road, and not wanting to alarm anyone, nor admit that we were lost, i simply headed in the right direction until i was in the right place........this song also makes me think of the loyal opposition, of whom i have seen so little this year, and read of so little this year......i do miss her special brand of irreverence......

      ok, so i just read about this on cnn.com.....  BALTIMORE, Maryland (AP) -- Authorities appealed to the public to identify an abandoned 3-year-old girl who says her name is Courtney, she's from Brooklyn and she wants her mommy.  her dad left her with stranger so he could 'cash a money order', and he did not return.......no idea where the mother is........9 years ago, i would have read this tale in disbelief......no reasonable parent does this kind of thing.....but that would have been before i met my third child's birth mother, birth father, associated social workers, foster parents, half-siblings, new husbands, et al...........somehow the term et al seems eerily out-of-place.........there is another world out there of people whose dysfunction goes beyond any lifetime channel made-for-tv movie.....and this dysfunction is something that daily love and attention by basically decent and caring people cannot erase.......my child's birth mother once attempted to give her half-brother away to a couple she met in the drivethru window at mcdonalds........had it not been the the vigilance of her social worker....the daughter of our child's original foster parents.....who divorced after we adopted.......he and his new wife are in our bookclub.....(his new wife ( a lawyer) is a friend of the lawyer who did the adoption case for us pro bono )got it? this is pretty convoluted stuff.......anyway.....we have seen abandonment, remorse, abandonment, remorse......so many times......and yet...we still allow our child's birth mother to have contact (we would allow the birth father contact, but he assured us that he had no......not worth going there........ ) because we know that it is important to our child to know that even though her birth mother has 'problems' she has not totally abandoned her.......and we have full expectation that when this child turns 18 she will try to live with this birth mother.........just because she will be legally able to do so.....ands she must then discover for herself that this is not a realistic option........we have 7 more years until this fateful day.......i try not to think about it......anyway.......i really feel for this child, found in baltimore......from brooklyn.......may she find peace........

      ok, so mm is quite smug about yesterday's elections, in which the 2 'yes'men for the evil mayor received bottom of the barrel votes.......only losing to the conservative preacher....i must say that i was torn in who (whom?) should be at the bottom....as i am totally against the clergy running for office......anyway.......the newspaper really played up on these incumbents being at the bottom of the heap of votes......they are so squirrelly that they did not announce their recommendation about cutting funding for our downtown promotion office until yesterday, when it was too late for the newspaper to cover the funding cut...which could have effected voting ( the paper comes out before the polls close......).....but that did not matter, because the 2 mayoral flunkies are certain to lose in november ( 8 will run-off for 4 slots in november....), given their lack of support yesterday........maybe they will cease in this curious triumverate with our vile and serpantlike mayor...........and reinstate 'heart of danville' funding.......i suspect not, as there is not a dram of shame amongst the 3 of them..........

      ok, so in the backround at my house since we got home has been oprah and her million dollar wedding giveaway finalists and voting......only 1 couple can win, the the other 2 couples get valaable prizes and go home dejected......if i had the option of having a million dollar wedding, i believe i would 'spend' the money differently than those blockbuster extravaganzas we have read about in print or that have been intimated about on this program.....this from the queen of lowbudget nuptuals......we spent the following on our wedding....the week after my spouse finished grad school......$60 on fabric for my dress (which i finished just hours before the wedding)....wedding cake- donated by my spouse's summer employer during 4 years of college- buskens bakery in hyde park, cincinnati......preacher......no idea...my parents did make a donation to the church general fund that covered the minister, and the lunch basics brought by my parents' sunday school class.......3 amish hams- my parents bought these.........violinist....again- no idea......but she was wonderful.......suit......ernst bought this at an outlet...for maybe $60. and my mother altered it.......assorted mints,napkins, punch, plates......not too much.......the bottom line.....we enjoyed a basic wedding and a basic reception....then spent the money we did not spend on a wedding on 3 weeks in europe........let me repeat....3 weeks in europe.......i have never had this much time off since, unless you count giving birth or recovering from a miscarriage........given those choices...big wedding or 3 weeks in europe....i would still choose 3 weeks in europe........i have attended weddings for friends that were over-the-moon....only to learn weeks/months later that they had already separated....i credit the longevity of our marriage, in part.....to our low-budget beginning.....no silly expectations about what marriage was about.....and a shared determination that the common goal (big honeymoon) was worth attaining through thrift...........of course, one must also give credit to a spouse more than willing to hyphenate.....and also to separate checking accounts.......amen , amen, and amen............

      ok, so i showed up to vote this morning, even though there was little to vote about........i finally cast a presidential primary vote.......though there are as yet no signs visible in my community for any candidate, let alone the clear frontrunner....we do not seem to be a 'battleground' state...sadly.....and there was a senatroial primary in which the opposition to the democratic favorite has the same name as the republican majority leader of the state house.....curious.....and a us house seat primary in which the opposition has already dropped out.....i would rather have voted 'in town' where city commision primary voting is taking place......more to vote out certain thorns......but this urge to live in town only comes around in voting seasons.......too bad that in our society, people cannot choose to vote where they work and/or own businesses rather than where they happen to live.......if i were queen, that is how i would do it..............

      ok, so tonight, when my spouse and i walked outside of our house to walk around the cirle, there was a woman in the road admiring the rose on the trellis....who looked vaguely familiar........because her daughter is on cayle's soccer team.....and she lives up and around the corner.....which we would know if cayle went to the boyle district school.......this lady was fully aware of these facts......she said....'now your daughter doesn't go to the county school'.......as if asking for an explanation......which i blamed on my older children.......'my boys wanted to play soccer for danville'.......that came out of my mouth like water goes under a bridge.......it was partly true......our eldest wanted to go to danville because when he was in 5th grade and had to go somewhere from montessori, his classmates were going to the danville system middle school, and they were all going to play soccer......the rest of the story went unsaid......it just cannot be offered as explanation...it is a story best kept as an answer to a direct, specific question....and that was not the case tonight.......so much for my bravado........

      ok, so i just finished rereading a book about the author's walk along the pilgrim route to santiago de compostella....in northern spain......2 years ago when i was traveling in the snow storm from bilbao to madrid we saw a pilgrim from the car.....and we were quite excited...because he was a real pilgrim....with a shell, and a floppy hat.......one day i would like to do this walk...from arles, or le puy...or vezelay......certainly not from paris on the rue st jacque because that is a long way indeed........but to make a real pilgrimage...surely that is a major life event.......to catholics......of which i am not and will never be.....in fact...i must confess to cynicism........sunday in church.......which i came every close to blowing off......was, in fact,........gideon sunday.....and half the congregation had already blown it off........i have heard the gideon spiel many times......the same way each and every time.....it would seem.......and i allowed myself to snicker with my middle child, during the message.....about the banality of it all.......i will admit, gentle readers, that i am loathe to proselytize......i believe religion to be personal, and not something to crow about to all/any who will listen.........so why would i want to walk the entire northern route from the french border to the ocean.....because it is there?.........the only interesting thing i found in the book club book about john adams........was the fact that he once landed near santiago and traveled to paris along the northern route.....he even wrote to his wife from bilbao.........which is not quite on the pilgrimage......but i have been to bilbao and to no other place on the pilgrimage....so i was interested to read this.......back to the catholic part....sunday, we sang a call to worship that sounded so catholic....i was thinking it, but my spouse actually leaned over and whispered...this sounds so catholic.....and i started snickering.......i feel guilty, snickering at church, but then i am so cynical......i would not be surprised that when one looks up cyncial in the dictionary......there would be a link to mm..........ah well........one day i will snicker the entire walk to santiago..........

      ok, so my new daytime dishwasher looks like a thinnish version of brad pitt.......and whilst this may seem like a bonus......let me say now that whenever one has a choice bewteen brains and beauty, it is always best to pick brains.....because when one exists without the other, it is painful indeed........the only good thing about the situation is that at least one waitress has been beside herself in trying to get dirty dishes to the dishroom.......but as for me......when someone cannot carry on a reasonable conversation, then what is the point of being on my payroll........

      ok, so the supreme court ruled segregated schools as unconstitutional 50 years ago today.....2 years before i was born, by the way......and today schools appear in danville to be not much better than they were when i moved here 23 years ago.....there is still a totally segregated school......ky school for deaf......which does not appear to have nondeaf kids begging to get in.....there is a totally integrated school system...the danville system........and then there is a semi-integrated school system...boyle county schools.....the qualifications for attending danville vs boyle was free choice...up until a few years ago.....therefore parents who lived in the city limited could opt to send their children to the county schools.....even if it meant driving by the danville schools to get to the county schools....and families who lived in the county district...like us...could opt to send their children to danville.....in the 18 years i worked at the hospital, i spoke to school classes freqently about good eating habits....to fully caucasion classes in the boyle schools.....'they' say that things have changed...that there are a few black kids who go to boyle.....mostly to be able to play football......gentle readers....both danville (class A) and boyle (class AAA) won state football titles last year.....we made the decision to send our children to danville based on the % of grads who went on to college......roughly 80% of danville grads versus 50% of boyle.....at least at the time......integration was a factor, but graduation odds tell a big tale.....at least about expectations in the curriculum, etc.....we were warned against this choice by well-meaning people who assured us that our children would be fearful of even going to the bathroom......where they would surely be beaten up and their lunch money stolen...this has never happened.but i am sure that many parents till make home purchase decisions now based on the school district....a tough choice in that the nicest homes are by the country club (still segregated, by the way, and with no c-w members)and in the danville district......ah well.......such is life in a free society.....

      ok, so last night our daughter stayed over with a friend who attends out church......so.......when ecw left to ride with his buddies, and i had read the paper on the deck,....and had enough coffee......i decided that i had time to 'lay back down' for a liitle while before sunday school.......and i woke up as his truck came back in the driveway.......and i got up and got dressed quickly to be able to make it to church on time.........gentle readers.....skipping sunday school is a slippery slope to heathen behavior......and i am so close to backslider status today......and the dreams that i had in my little 'nap' were so bizarre...............hardly worth it.........

      ok, so when i was in grad school at u.c.  jerry springer was mayor of cincinnati........one of his more interesting scandals involved paying a hooker with a personal check.....on the day he got married.......and now this bit of news was on-line....  CINCINNATI, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio Democrats have chosen talk-show host Jerry Springer to be an at-large delegate for the Democratic National Convention in Boston.  oh, my.......i may be a liberal, but i am not stupid............. jerry springer has been lewd enough to make the hippest hippie go republican......why can't he just stay on his ill-favored reality program and leave the rest of the democratic party alone......

      ok, so i just had a lovely chat with my eldest....who is just tickled (my words, not his...) with his room, his roommates, his neighborhood, his job,......he is working 40 hours a week at the big uk library......and so far he has read 1 book a day between tasks......and has found 2 hours a day to work on his novel.....which brings us to my novel.....which i do not spend time with, let alone 2 hours a day......i am not quite sure where it is.....having brought the big guggenheim bag in from the car when we got back from our upeast trip........it is in that bag...but i am not sure where that bag is as i sit here at the pc.......my eldest told me that i have to spend time with it....not just think about it.......i do think that writing htis blog keeps me in tune with my plot, but i have not actually knit together any of the themes i have previously plotted out.....i can 'tell' the book, but i haven't written enough down to feel like a novelist.......at least not in the way my eldest describes his work.......he has so much potential....i am so thrilled that he is finding his stride.......and managing to make it to work on time........

      ok, so tomorrow in mass......gays may legally marry....npr has run several interviews with folks on both sides of the bouquet.......a female justice of the peace who resigned rather than sanctify such unions.....and a small town who is so excited about the prospect that they are rolling out the red carpet for willing couples........in my view, a commitment is a commitment, regardless of gender......and there should be legal benefits attached.......i am amazed at those who i go to church with who have commented recently that they din't know what all of the fuss is about......as there are no gays around here.....i about choked......because we have gay couples who attend our church....not openly so......not hand-holding open......but for church members to be innocently unaware is quite amazing to me at this late date.........i am saddened that the church of christ on lexington road has gone through such turmoil over having an openly gay deacon......our church went through a similar disruption over having female deacons.......our church has also had gay deacons......but again, they were not 'out' and therefore seemed safe as 'unmarried' men of god.......well, mass. needs our collective prayers for the days ahead.......

      ok, so we sat up and watched the last original episode of frasier.....not the last episode, because the 11 year run will live on reruns for the next few years at least........i have not watched this show faithfully.......mostly because the time slot...9-ish......competes with a hot bath.....and there is no contest on most days if i can choose a hot bath and something cold to drink.......however....i am sad that this show is ending...because it was so intelligent in its humor......we laughed loudly during several of the scenes......especially when fraiser's dad thought for a moment that the monkey he was carrying was his newborn baby........it may  have been an old gag, but it was funny.........the only show that i watch faithfully is.......alias......as my family and friends are well-aware.....there is nothing funny about this show......i enjoy trying to guess where the plot line is going....i predict that theywill find rimbauldi himself in some cave at the cliffhanger moment....like the part in indiana jones and the last crusade when they find the crusader still alive, waiting for the next knight to come and relieve his vigil over the cup of christ.....i like the strong female lead......not that i envision myself as her, but i like notion of an international woman of mystery.........yeah.....

      ok, so this was in reader's almanac for may 16....my brother's birthday as i now remember...i must remember to call him...  It was on this day in 1763 that James Boswell first met Samuel Johnson, the man who would become the subject of his life's work, (books by this author). Boswell was twenty-three years old at the time, bumming around London, going to parties and brothels, and feeling like he was wasting his life. He kept a very detailed diary and wanted to be a writer, but he didnt know what to write about other than himself. His literary hero was the scholar and writer Samuel Johnson. Boswell had heard that Johnson sometimes stopped by a particular bookshop in London, so Boswell began to spend time there in hopes of running into the great man.  Boswell was drinking tea at the bookshop on this day in 1763, when his friend Thomas Davies told him that Johnson had just come into the shop. Boswell got incredibly nervous when Johnson came into the room. They got into an argument about a man they both knew, and the meeting ended poorly, but Boswell wouldn't give up. He went to a party at Johnson's house a few weeks later, and after the party was over Johnson asked him to stay a little longer to talk. Boswell ended up telling Johnson the story of his life and his struggle to find a vocation. The two men became close friends, and Boswell began to write a book about Johnson that would become his obsession.   Boswell tried to write down everything Johnson did and said in his presence, in order to preserve it for posterity. Boswell's attention occasionally irritated Johnson, and Johnson once said to Boswell, "You have but two topics, yourself and me, and I'm sick of both."  Boswell's The Life of Samuel Johnson came out in 1791, after Johnson;s death, and it became a bestseller. By 1825, all of Samuel Johnson's writings were out of print, and they didn't come back into print for another hundred years. But Boswell's book about Johnson went through forty-one English editions in the nineteenth century alone. Boswell managed to write a book about Johnson that is more interesting to us today than the books that Johnson wrote.

      ok ,so my friend gail lent us 2 dvd's to watch this week.....montster's ball.....which we are saving for a completely private moment......and a long walk home...with whoopie goldberg and sissy spacek.......nothing brings out the northern liberal angst like a film with southern violence, abuse, gospel singing,......colored versus whites........i never grew up with any of this....in my birthtown...millersburg, ohio......we grew up with amish children....who were different...but not so different......they did not watch tv.....nor wear underwear with elastic......they wore diapers pinned together with straight pins......now that is devotion......so in my 5th grade year when we moved briefly to hillsboro, ohio.......i was somewhat unprepared for the integrated school that my parents sent us to....it was closer than the segragated school that our neighbors attended.......i can recall being threatened in the bathroom, briefly,.........and then it must have been no fun for the people involved because it never happened again.........because i never play along.........anyway.....we moved that same year to a county that was 100% caucasion.....and that played out until i went to college, and found a job at mt. carmel medical center, where the kitchen staff was 100% black.......i gave rides to and from work to workmates because it was on my way.....and because these people were my friends....my card-playing friends....we played spades every break for 2 solid years.....if i miss anything about columbus, ohio,. it is cards....................so here we are tonight, having just watched the movie gail lent us....and she is not here....she was up to the restaurant helping with the dishes so i could go home.......at least until her daughter was ready for prom.....maybe we will win the lottery tonight, and she will really be my millionaire friend gail......and we will pay other people to do dishes for us......but until we win, well gail is the kind of girl that i owuld want my brother to settle down with......hard-working, dilligent, direct...........any that gail is at work is a good day.....

      ok, so today on the way home from work, i espied in a yard 3 huge lupines......enormous lupines......such as they have in catalog pictures.....certainly not in real life......lupines catch my eye because (1) they remid me of a marvelous day in the west when we were hiking and came across lovely low-growing lupines in full bloom....and (2) because i cannot seem to grow them at all....... no matter if it is from seed, or from nursery plants...they die in my care as if they know that they are misplaced and doomed from the beginning.......plants like azalias.......i understand my inability to grow them.......we live on limestone.....quite close to limestone, in fact......so acid-loving plants like azalia, rhodedendrons, blueberries, dogwoods......might as well throw them over the cliff for all that they will live in our yard.......so what is the deal with lupines.......

      ok so today a girl came into the restaurant wearing a dress that reminded me of a 4-h project i did in the 7th or 8th grade.....it was pitifully tacky then......who knew.......but horrific in 2004........polyester stripes going in different directions in at least 2-3 shades of green and beige......oh my......it really took my back.......needless to say, i did not win the fashion show at the fair that year............what was i thinking?

      ok, so the mm may just get radical at this wedding in june.....a catholic wedding at st. somebody's church.....at numerous gatherings in the past, my ultra-catholic relations made it plain that i, a non-catholic, could not take communion......though my spouse, raised catholic but baptised in the southern baptist camp....could take communion because he did not denounce his catholic roots........go figure.......but maybe....just maybe, i could shake things up a bit by just marching up to the front and taking communion with everybody else.......gentle readers.....be aware that my sisters-n-law would have a collective fit......and might just convulse into tremors......but would not that be worth it for just a moment of civil disobedience?.........

      ok, so the discussion at the dinner table turned to the invitation.......and then my spouse posed the question to the table.....who knows how to spell mamma's given name.........yes.....one out of 2 present knew that my name is not kathy, but kathlyn........not kathryn because a ill-favored aunt might think i was named after her.....a point of trivia.....kathlyn is the name of both warren beatty's mother and oldest daughter........and then he turned the tables on his own name....also misspelled frequently......and our daughter was unaware that his name is ernst, and not ernest..............ah well........and then there are the people who spell stephan with an 'en' or an 'even'....or people who spell cayle in numerous ways.....the worst was a race in which she finished as 'caylor'.....my boys still use that name on occassion...............what's in a name?........lots of emotion............it would appear..............

      ok ,so i have been in the weber family officially for nearly 24 years.........and today we received a wedding invitation made out to ernst, cathy and children........gentle readers, the delightful bride was born just weeks after our wedding in 1981......so one would think that she, and her mother who has known me longer....could spell my name correctly.......let's see......i have personally addressed christmas cards to her family for the past 24 years........and i do not believe that i misspelled my name to confuse or confound them........further, these are not people who would think that a 'c' made  for better alliteration........i am ticked off.......can one reasonably discount the gift based on a fumbled name........yeah, yeah, yeah.....i know that i am being quite petty....but then...i am the meanmamma.........which has no 'k's or 'c's.............

      ok, so the trellis rose(s) will probably be in full view this weekend......those who live within driving distance of this blog's origin are invited to come on out to see it.....sunday would be a great day....anyway.....the trellis rose bushes, city of york, were the suggestion of my husband's oldest brother, who runs a rosarium in the dc area as a sideline......he gve these bushes to us...but sold a large number to monticello several years ago, as the bush is listed as one grown by jefferson......the trellis was built by my spouse and my dad one fine weekend......so i always think of my father whenever the roses bloom over it......the bush blooms on new canes....so i am loathe to trim it back.....it does occassionally grab ahold of people who get too close.......ah well...such is the ilk of beauty............

      ok, so today i am making tarte au citron, with a mix purchased at the bon marche in paris........i would have prepared it before now had i quite understood that i would have to make my own tarte shell....pate brissee or some other pie dough....so today i remembered to bring home a frozen pie dough sheet (purchased by the case of 24......)  and we will have lemon tarte as dessert for my mother's birthday this evening.......we are having pizza.......grandma is ordering it in......because nothing else sounded good her to......she likes hawaiian pizza with ham and pineapple......i hope that we get one without ham and p.a........for the rest of us........pizza delivery is as rare around here as chinese takeout......but there was not a scrap leftover from lunch.......and mother thought that 'the children' might like pizza.....which means she wanted pizza......but that is her perogative.......when you get over the age of 75.........you tend to get your way more often than not...............wish me luck on this tarte, as i do not actually read french....and i am hoping that the picture directions on the back are all there is to this........

      ok, so we all went tot he funeral home in lexington last night.......the big yellow one on the harrodsburg road that is every bit as huge inside as it appears from the road......by the full parking lot we assumed that there was more than one funeral going on.....no....this was all for larry.....we waited 30 minutes in line before actually getting a chance to hug the widow and speak softly to his sons and mother........the only brightness to lighten the mood was the flowers.......incredible flowers......there was a spectacular vase full of calla lilies.....so simple and so elegant...and so eloquent an ellegy to our friend.......i can think of no purer a tribute than a vase of calla lilies......that will be the worst part of my own demise.....apart from the being dead part......i will not get to see the flowers...what was sent and who sent them......being a reasonable person, i would probably request at the end that no flowers be sent....that tress be planted in my name instead.......but last night, i was wowed by the floral display.....

      ok, so i read about this in the nra newsletter.....in my profession, nra stands for national restaurant association.....  In Boston, it's all in the family  Sibling restaurateurs Robert and David Kinkead, the former of Washington, D.C.'s Kinkead's and the latter a corporate chef for Todd English, will open a joint restaurant in Boston called Sibling Rivalry. The restaurant, expected to open this October, will feature a split menu divided by the brother's dishes.   The Boston Globe (5/12)  frankly, i cannot see myself ever doing any sort of business venture with my sibling.......especially since the best name has already been taken....hawks and doves in washington dc......that basically sums up our political agendas..i suppose we could come with a few signature dishes....like a creamed crow pie, for when certain repubublicans need to eat some of the above.........

      ok, so in the middle of the lunch rush, my hair started getting in my eyes.........at least my bangs were in the way.....so i took a pair of scissors and trimmed them......into the trash can...without benefit of a mirror........they feel much better...but they look awful.......i will have to trim them up a bit better before we drive to the funeral home in lexington this evening.........larry's widow.....who hyphenated her name, by the way......put a 2 column obit in yesterday's lexington herald leader......that must have cost her a pretty penny......but then her grief is great......you only meet the love of your life that one time......and they were the perfect couple, as late-life couples go.......and they were kind to our daughter...remembering special events in her life.....a lengthy obit that even mentions the cats he left behind is just the sort of thing one would expect/understand from a widow of a short but excellent marriage......i am not so sure that my family could come up with 2 columns.......though they seem to have glimpses of deep understanding of my psyche from time to time......my mother presented me with a gift certificate for a manicure for mother's day.......and my middle child remarked later, in a whisper........mom, you're not the manicure type....what was grandma thinking?.........he is right, i am not the manicure type.....women who cut their own bangs without a mirror do not tend to be the manicure type.......i do draw the line at decency...i never wear ill-matching clothing, even when doing mundane chores like cleaning closets or painting outdoor furniture......and i always wear a belt if there are belt-loops.......ah well............at least my bangs are no longer in my eyes..........

      ok, so there is a rage distinct from other rages....that is a direct by-product of the computer age......there is road rage.....which i feel on occassion when it takes me longer than 4-5 minutes to get across town.....or longer than 1 light to make a left hand turn from main street.......there is dubya rage......which tends to kick in when i listen to the news.....the particular idiocies change daily, but not my response......add to this the rage that happens when the comments disappear from my blog....or it takes way too long for my blog to upload.....or posts seem to disappear....or email bounces back like it has been blocked......or blogger is'unavailable' at the time i want to blog......it is all so vexing.......and i feel so out-of-control in any of it.......i only passed computer programming in the late 70's because my roommate wrote the programs for me......don't recall which language i did not learn...fortran?  cobal? i was able to borrow the code necessary to import comments into my blog.....but i do not pay for this service, so i should not be surprised when these comments go away.......frustrated, but not surprised..........

      ok, so i am done with all 7 of the tapes with my library 'book'......and til the end, the murderer of the cook was not named.......the sleuth/narrator was following a cross between an agatha christie english manor house mystery, and a phillip marlowe/sam spade hardboiled mystery......so at the end....the female sidekick (who in this case is short and lesbian...go figure.....) asks the rampantly heterosexual burglar/bookstore owner who killed the cook.....he replied that he did not know.....he knew who killed the pseudo-victorian male model, and the silent, stiff-upper lip brit, and the hapless handyman......but not who killed the cook..........he quoted a line from the filming of  the big sleep, in which the actors were debating a line in the screenplay......who had killed the chauffeur....they called in the author, who said that he did not know who killed the chauffeur........yes, he wrote the book, but he did not know the answer to all questions..........ah well.........in agatha's books, we always knew who killed who.........that is the shame about american things./..we are sometimes ok with a story half-told........

      ok, so there has come to be an informal support group of boston fans, here in central ky.........i was found out by the bartender, one day when i was following the game online.......and he has mentioned it to the bourbon/wine wholesaler........who has mentioned it to our octogenarian doorman........anyway.......i was not the one who initiated the conversation today about yesterday's game.... and all agree that the best series ever would be between the cubs and the redsox.......and that the yankees are overpaid pondscum.......but that goes unsaid..........

      ok, so after work, we arrived home to find that ecw had driven the car rather than the truck......so i did what one does when one finds an empty truck......i went to the garden center and bought a load of mulch........and the term meanmamma resounded amongst my kin.....because when my daughter asked could she go play with the neighbor girl, i said no.......because we have work to do........when mamma....when can i play?.......when the truck is empty....that's when..........well, the neighbor girl actually came over and started helping us........and actually said the following words, within earshot of my child......'i really like to do mulch,.....i like the feel of it.....i like to work, and feel that i have finished something......' gentle readers.....this child is 9. and a child after my own heart.......whenever my own child whined about wanting to play.....our little neighbor girl replied that there would be time to play when the work was done....................whoa..........clarification.....this conversation took place in my mother's yard.....we start there....because it is at the top of the hill, and because it is easier to get her gardening chores over early.......than to listen to the questions regarding why her gardening chores are not yet done..........so we emptied an entire truckload of mulch, and did not begin to finish her mulching needs.......i did try, truth be told, to finish the job without her knowing we were there........it is so much easier that way.......to focus on the job at hand.....when my mother is present she starts to think about things the way they could be if we had 1)unlimited funds   2)unlimited labor   3) unlimited time........and i cannot feel that special zing of completion when so many future projects hang in the balance.........as luck would have it, the neighbor girl left at precisely 4:30 to go home so she could eat and make it to her 5:00 dog training class........she apologized to cayle that she could not possibly 'play' until maybe friday, because of her commitments........but hey, she was mighty helpful while she was with us......and i can only hope that her unusual brand of work ethic rubs off on my child............

      ok, so we went up to mother's yard after supper, to see what scw had planted after supper, and to see what damage the water company had done in repairing their line........there had been a big wet sink in my mom's yard, and since it did not show up on her bill, it had to be the water company's problem.......well. i stoood by the big hole long enough that my mother's neighbor...(and my neighbor) came out to ask about why i was standing there with a hose.......now,. gentle readers....i have never met this neighbor, he is like the author of catcher in the rye......and he stayed long enough to  ascertain that the water problem would not be assigned to his bill........and then he was gone......anyway....we re-seeded my mother's yard where the water company fixed her leak, then went on down to our yard to re-seed our own bare spots.....and that is when calamity struck......the nozzle burst off of our hose.......leaving me a sopping mess..........and a continued mess....as we were not done with our bare spots....and lord knows we do not stop until we are done...........................i put down that nozzle at the first opportunity...................and left it to god's grace........or the partner who also knows how to shut off the water.....................

      ok, so for once...the cook is tghe 3rd to go in the list of murder victims in my current on-tape novel.....and the text has gotten understandably humerous....they have a house full of people, and the cook dead.......so far they have subsisted on leftover ham and boiled cabbage......but the weekend is but half over....so where do we go from here......................raw potatoes....cracker jacks..........tinned tuna.........i love it.......no reasonable writer kills off the cook......

      ok, so my obsession with sitemeter continues........and so does my amusement/amazement at the timezones/web addresses/domains of serial readers.............speaking of domains.......what sort of person has his own domain.......named presumably after himself.....no dot-com......just a name.....for a domain...........curious.......this 'fellow' has logged on several times int he past few days.....and then there is the disney reader.......somebody at disney.com is not taking care of mickey.....he is reading the meanmamma........this just makes me chuckle out loud.................and then there are the others....attbi.....for example........as if these people know who they are....i did not know that i was logged on as qwest until i started tracking my own web traffic............the bottom line....i am enormously diverted................as elizabeth bennet would say..............

      ok, so my eldest child popped in from lexington....and after a little chinese carryout.......he settled in to advise me that i will never be a serious writer until i can commit to 1000 words a day..................gentle readers.....this is the child who....does not read my blog, on general principal......and......therefore has no idea just how much writing i do in an average day......whilst blogger has no actuall word-count...............imagine a pause here....i am counting the words typed so far.......finger to the screen. mind you.....so i can keep track......oh my.......so this blog will only have about 100 words.......so i have to blog 10 times to meet this quota........either that, or i will have to double up on words so that only 5 entries are necessary......and then none of these words are necessarily directed toward a plot............i do have that secret blog.....i could be working out plot lines there.......hmmmmmm..........so many words....so little time.................

      ok, so i believe that born again middle aged baseball fans may be the new voting block for the next election........the new soccer moms, if you will........this evening.....home alone for a time.....i entertained myself by voting the 25 vote maximum allowed by mlb.....why?......because i could,.....that's why............and because i checked the voting totals so far....and decided there were far too many yankees...and far too few redsox.......curious what a sense of power on-line voting imparts............if only the national election were so simplified......a glass of wine.....the ballot on-screen...............push submit.........and on to the next 24 ballots........only in america..............

      ok, so who would have thought that i would have 1500 things to say.....subjects to ponder.......memories to muse upon.......wrongs to rant about........i am grateful that blogger has a search feature........i can make sure that i have not repeated my stores too many times.......in truth, i can name only a handful of brave souls who have read each and every one of those numerous posts....thanks for your support......

      ok, so my fascination with my sitemeter continues.........i am currently perplexed as to how viewers can change time zones overnight.........most often it is central time zone in the evening.......and by morning the same reader will be eastern time zone........and this same reader has been both windows xp and mac within a few hours but with the same internet address.........which essentially leads me to doubt the accuracy of any of the information provided by the sitemeter service.......ah well........at least somebody reads it.........even if under mysterious circumstances........

      ok, so the visit is almost over........and i have so many mixed, but not-unblogged...emotions about it.........my daughter traveled many hours yesterday to meet her birth mother's mother.........and when i asked her the name of this person......my daughter could not tell me.....because it had never occurred to her to ask...and/or never occurred to her birth mother to tell her......or to the grandmother to announce it..........as a person enamored of genealogy i am astounded by this behavior......but neither surprised nor angered.......what i can tell you about this visit....is that i am probably the only one who has a problem with it....i am the one who is basically judgmental, elitist, and close-minded..........and i have to take this into consideration when friends ask 'how is it going'..........maybe i can be my own support group.....'my name is kc-w, and i am an intolerant bitch........'

      ok, so last night...when i was searching for my transcripts.....i came across a box of  urlLink notebooks .......6-7 notebooks.....dating from my senior year in high school and ending sometime in the grad school years...........curious....that i could forget that i used to keep a journal of sorts.......bad poems.......  novel notes ......there is a sheaf of loose yellow paper that contain bits of a  urlLink novel  with a name too banal to disclose......i have not read any of them closely...though i suspect that my  urlLink mother  read them thoroughly before she 'found' them during her move to danville....another day perhaps.....i will share a  urlLink poem  written by a friend on an envelope at a joe walsh concert......on march 9, 1975  you only know as far as you go and nothing is left in the way the moon leaves the sky and the stars start to cry til the sun comes around  with the day   and another, written on the flap...  off and gone and far beyond the Walsh familiar skies it all comes back from distant tracks and Joe's to know you're why.........  he was a morose fellow.......it was not a date, by the way...just a lot of people from the dorm complex........for a short time he would leave  urlLink crytpic poetry  in my mailbox.......  anyway...back to the  urlLink notebooks .......they read like  urlLink blogs ......but, then gentle readers..... urlLink you already saw that coming ............

      ok, so i have mentioned this before.....raved and ranted about it actually......but it is worth bringing up again.......the best part of about living on a lake is sitting on the back deck, with a cup of coffee, reading the newspaper at the table covered by a cloth that matches the chairpad.......with mist rising up from the surface of the water.......and a dog or two beneath me feet.....and the cat preening closeby........the only way things could get better than that would be the opportunity to go back to bed and not to work........

      ok, so i am home...and nobody else is home...and this is happening much too often.........our daughter has gone to indiana to meet her birth-grandmother.....and our middle child is down the road at governor's scholars...where he should recieve a note asking him to meet with the french professor on thursday at 10:00 am to discuss his taking a senior level french class at centre as a senior in hs........for the record, scw...the registrar called today and i gave him your schedule for the week......he will contact professor wyatt...........i am unused to being home alone......and after reading the local paper....i am reading a mystery with a transparent plot............and thinking about searching for my college transcripts so i can apply for the clinical nutritionist job currently available 1 county over.....about 7 miles.........i am over-qualified....but it is close............

      ok, so the new yorker will not be here for several more days.......even though it is printed in  urlLink danville, ky .....not 5 miles from my house.....i almost never get it until thursday or friday....whilst the content has been online since monday.........i have oft remarked that this  urlLink magazine  is one of my  urlLink main pleasures in life .........an aside.....i had to explain just today at the library......who was suggesting soy shakes as a remedy for  urlLink hot flashes ...that i do not like sweet milk shakes....whether they are chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.....nor do i like 'bars' of any kind.........i do not find pleasure in the taste, the  urlLink texture .....and....it is only in danville that women my age feel free to discuss  urlLink menopause  while checking out books..........i was flattered, by the way, that these women were surprised that i was old enough..........anyway.....back to the new yorker.........i just love the cartoons.......they are  urlLink so insightful ....... urlLink so frank .........

      ok,so this morning, someone from pentagon.mil read 3 pages of my blog through the archives.....for a grand total of 59 seconds.......which means they did not really read it closely, or read the best parts.......and i am pretty certain that the reader was not my sibling.......he would have read the latest entries.......but still i am honored to have been discovered by the pentagon......while it is still the pentagon rather than the ronald reagan center for world-wide dominance.....or thereabouts........

      ok, so a respected blogger recently noted that she was unable to see a notable piece of liberal bullshit because it was sold-out.......gentle readers........one can only speak lightly of liberalism when one has not slogged through the oppresive 80's.....when 'l' was an evil word.......i applaud michael moore for his courage is risking everything he holds dear to bring this film to the screen.......he could have sat back and munched bonbons paid for by his columbine film..........and made no effort to co-opt the 2004 election..........and i give him much credit for how far he has come on so meagre a budget...........of course.....the dubya-bush administration fueled the project for no charge at all............

      ok,so today at governor's scholar's parents info session....we heard a nasty crack about laundry and sons.......the assumption that if we had sons attending...they may not do laundry in the 5 weeks of the session.............and i have a graver concern........that the females i saw registering for gsp were of the pseudo-neo-post stepford connection.....and looked too prissy to be real scholars........i hope that i am wrong.....that these females are...in fact.....radical feminists ready to take back the reality that is their birthright from 70's sacrifices..........and that they will be serious students rather than the alternative................just an observation...............

      ok, so i have become a  urlLink slave to public television  today......and in addition to a dithering show that featured a master craftsman making a blanket chest while we watched..voyeurism never had it so good..........i sat enthralled by the victory  urlLink garden .......from boston, mass........today's episode, filmed who knows when....included the annual beacon hill garden tour, which has a 75-year history...............and this is where the 'f' word comes in....the commentator had so many 'f' words...it was hard to keep track.... urlLink fabulous,   urlLink fantastic , fluid,  urlLink foliage ,  urlLink flora , feature (as in water....), forced (as in  urlLink bulbs ....), foundation (as in plantings), well....you get the picture..............and all of these  urlLink gardens  were absolututely  urlLink to-die-for  (another f......)....... urlLink go figure ...........

      ok, so my middle child leaves home today for a 5-week stint as a governor's scholar........and though we are only driving him across town.....it is still 5 weeks......and parents are only allowed to 'visit' campus on july 10.......i have offered the use of the restaurant washing machine for saturday mornings......trc is within the legal 'walking distance/perimeter' for scholars on centre campus........church is also within the legal limit.......but all of these options are up to him.......he is probably looking forward to 5 weeks away from everything except the task at hand....learning russian......and experiencing college life...........and meeting other smart-kids......the general gist of governor's scholars is to entice the best and the brightest in the state to take a closer look at kentucky schools......and hopefully to choose a ky college.....uk offers free rides to governor's scholars........and other colleges 'make it worth it' in some way.......ah well.....i just have to get over this pre-emptynest angst............

      ok, so my middle child has spent many hours of late interviwing my mother on videotape.......not for a school project, but for his own personal interest.............somewhere in this house is the audio tape i made of my grandfather broughton.....from cleveland, ohio..........on which he describes ty cobb as a drunkard and tells about the day he stopped at the barbershop on the way home from school to have his blond curls cut off.........i was a poor interveiwer.......being young and naive.....so i did not know to ask him .....was he a klan member?.......and did he have black kinfolk?...and how could a family who ran an underground railroad stop have gotten so far off track in 2-3 generations......ah well.....when my mother's cousin was in town 2 years ago.....my mother was not surprised when cousin bruce mentioned that his grandfather.......had a brother who married a black woman...that would also be my mother's grandfather........my mother went so far as to say that there were black broughtons at ohio university when she was in college, and that she wondered if they were kin........and she recalled a family of black folk who came to sunday night supper a few times......and she wondered if they were kin.......but she never asked............and so we will never know....because we are too shy to ask the right questions...............

      ok, so i have taken the time to read through back-issue daily reasons....this is from somewhere around day 20..  President Bush's 2004  urlLink official election campaign  sells clothing made in Myanmar. This is in direct violation of Bush's own trade embargo against the country, one of the world leaders in sex trafficking, human rights abuses, and narcotics production. The US is currently experiencing the  urlLink worst textile industry slump since 1953 , due in part, to inadequately enforced trade laws.   what can you say about a  urlLink guy who breaks his own rules ........and appears to be able to make a few more bucks of  urlLink profit off the backs of foreign sweat shops  when folks in conservative central ky would probably have been honored to make his lousy t-shirts.........

      ok,so the new gourmet magazine came today....and though i have been in the restaurant business for 4 solid years....i have never looked at recipes and thought...wow.....i could make something like this and sell it........but today...i read a brief piece and thought....wow.....i should learn how to make goat cheese................to fill you in on the details.....there was a block in the 1st quarter section....usually devoted to blocks about this or that.......featuring farming internships/apprenticeships.......this is gourmet's annual farming/foodsource issue.......and there is a farm somewhere in ky that focuses on the making of goat cheese, as well as other organically grown produce, that is looking for apprentices for their growing season, but would consider short-termers who would pitch a tent and learn the art of making goat cheese..............gentle readers......if ever i was to consider farming/manufacture of any kind...it would be involving cheese...........cheese is something for which i feel true passion.....my earilest memory of my hometown is in a swiss-owned cheese house....in the curing room.....which smelled nutty....and tasting a bit of cheese cut from a huge wheel......the floor was wet concrete........and the air was moist.......why could not someone make cured goat cheese in a similar manner......of course, i would have to win the lottery to buy the horse farm down the road.......and buy goats.......i do not think i could actually eat the goats.........that was the worst part of cold mountain, by the way...........i am too squeamish for eating goats, however.....i have read that there is a huge market for goats in the islamic community during festival months...........anyway.....i have shifted my lottery fantasy......to include goatherd/cheesemaker............as long as i had people who could milk while i traveled................

      ok, so the mm has an affinity for wimbledon tennis............depsite the fact that she does not actually play.......just bear with me......growing up....chrissie evert was the queen...everybody wanted to be be chrissie...and then this foreigner named martina wanted to horn in on chrissie's glory.......chrissie and martina...so lovely to watch on tv.......so many afternoons i tuned in to see who would prevail..us open...the french....austrialia,virginia slims......and wimbledon........both made the game seem so effortless..........when i woke up from anesthesia after my ectopic pregnancy...chrissie evert was bowing goodbye to centre court after losing to martina......my 3-day recovery in-hospital is remarkable because i got to watch the remainder of wimbledom tennis...on cable....with nobody else trying to change the channel................when we took our 2 boys to england for the first time.....the train stopped at wimbledon...right in from of the tennis facility...on our way to hampton court...............and so today...when i checked the standings online.....i was saddened to see that martina...at the ripe old age of 47, was out of wimbledon singles.......heavens sakes.....you have to applaud a woman who at nearly my age will attempt such a feat..........chrissie gave up years ago to do fluff-commentary...but not martina.....she still plays doubles........bless her heart.............

      ok, so my third child's birth mother comes tommorrow, along with her current husband.......for a week's visit.......we agreed to these terms...and we're sticking to them.....but this sense of duty does not take away from the apprehension such a visit entails.........these are the days when i wish that i could press the skip button on the dvd remote.........and just be beyond......the whole affair brings out the worst in me.......and these days of hormonal dysfunction....the worst is pretty frightening.......the truth is.....we really like the current spouse....he is a salt-of-the-earth kind of guy.......and seems to be a positive force in the birth mother's life......so why cannot i not bring myself to invite them to stay here, rather than rent a hotel room.......and why cannot i bring myself to let our daughter stay in their hotel room for the duration.............i just cannot do this.......too many past issues........i suppose.....not be aired in this venue.........it is our job to protect and nurture this child until such time as she is legally and emotionally ready to move on..........and we are not nearly there yet..........

      ok, so on my way home from work, i saw from a distance a woman walking slowly along the shoulder of the road......and thought it strange given the location.....no houses close-by....and then the reality unfolded........on the shoulder across the road was parked a little suburu wagon/hatchback...with the hatch up.......and she was carrying a few flat rocks to place carefully with the others already layered on a red-print quilt.......she was systematically......hauling away a stone fence built by slaves 200-260 years ago.......probably without permission.....from a piece of property that i could not even guess the ownership despite the fact that i have traveled this 4-mile stretch most days for 22 years.......for starts......she is taking a huge risk....as it is snake season....and snakes like to hole-up in cool stone fences..........second......if the owner did happen along, she could be prosecuted for theft........and third.....the shoulder is narrow...and she was at the top of a hill with little leeway for any car trying to avoid her as she crossed the road.......gentle readers.....when i had stone walks....many of those stones came from creek beds.....from construction sites.....but never from an existing stone fence.......even in poor repair they are our heritage...........i regret that i did not stop the car and berate her for her ignorance.............of course.....given the number of layers of rock she already had in her car.......she may just damage her suspension....which should cost her big time............what goes around comes around........

      ok, so yesterday was the first home swim meet that wasn't rained out........and it was a misery to attend.......to see any of our daughter's races required standing in the blistering sun, which seemed as intense at 6:30 pm as it did at noon.......resisting the urge to coach is also tough.......mostly because to yell at your child...'quit looking at the swimmers in the other lanes because it wastes time'.......will not improve her time at all if she is swimming in a race at the time.........nor will be helpful when the race is over because it comes off as criticism....as in 'i cannot do anything right according to you......'.......so we keep these observations to ourselves and hope that the paid coach notices that our child continually looks to see where everybody else is during a race.......and this distraction puts her further and further behind........too bad there isn't a swimming specific drug that helps this problem....now that woudl be useful technology in this 'we have a drug for every occassion' world..........

      ok, so this morning after i dropped off cayle at her elementary-to-middle-school transition program......i ambled on into work....as i was getting out of the van....at about 8:20.....i could hear someone yelling......'hey.....i want to order.....are you in there.....i want a blast.......did you hear me......'....i din't even have to turn around to know what was going on............there is a baskin-robbins drivethru right beside our parking lot........and someone was barking into the order-frame......at 8:20 am,....as if anybody was there at 8:20 am...to make a cappy blast. or whatever..........i suppose in our need-filling economy people believe that everybusiness is open at every hour to fill every whim/need.........by the time i had gotten all of my stuff out of the van, and had loaded in the recycling.....the fellow decided to move on to other drivethrus...........

      ok, so we were slow today at lunch....and susie, our retired-schoolteacher hostess entertained us by crank-calling......christian bookstores........the conversation went something like this.....susie-i am looking for the new clinton book....are you sold out or do you still have one more copy?'......bookstore (bs) 'no we do not have that book'....susie-'are you sold out, or havn't received shipment?'   bs- no-we do not stock that book....susie-'will you be getting any in this week...or can i order one from you?'  bs- no, we are not stocking that book, nor ordering that book.....'it was too funny..........for the record....maddie's books sold out the 10 they ordered, and they are almost out of the next 10 they ordered yesterday...having promised them to callers........so much for the 100,000 copies that barnes and noble sold the first day.........it may not be a piece of scholarly mastery.....but.......i really miss the clinton whitehouse.....despite his infidelity......the clinton years were good years for me personally, for me politically......for me socially.......at least clinton didn't lie about anything that would hurt anybody except himself, his partner, or his family.........unlike dubya.....whose string of falsehoods has us up to our ears in middle-eastern chaos.......susie and i have talked about buying plaster dogs....and painting them yellow.....and placing them on our porches.........get-it...yelllow dog....democrats..........nyuck, nyuck........

      ok, so mm now wakes up regularly at night, in an uncomfortable heated-over state.......i am not yet convinced that this is a hot  flash , because it seems to last forever....anyway....once awake.....i cannot seem to get back to sleep.......and i seem to think my most hopeless thoughts......from silly things to big ticket issues.......and so here i am, unrested, looking 58 rather than 48.......and feeling much older........mick jagger, who sang the lead lines.....he must be over 60 by now and nearing 70....hope he sleeps better and feels better than this............

      ok, so i finally figured out how to vote online for the all-star game....and was assured that i could vote up to 25 times.......25 times.......i could take them up on that in a presidential election year....but for baseball..............my couldn't recall now who i voted for the first go-around......is it fair? 25 votes per person who who can figure out how to vote...........so lopsided..............

      ok, so there is a serial reader to my blog who checks in on central time.......which i understand to be between the mississippi and the mountains....who do i know there.........? i have a sorority sister who lives in texas, but she and i have not spoken since scw had the chicken pox and we were coming home from the west, and she was unavailable.....of course, this was 15 years ago...........and it is high time we made up.........especially since no one since has had her particular brand of humor...........she found amusement in trolls, of all things, and i always think of her when trolls are discussed...........trolls make me laugh, by the way......anyway...i fantasize that the is somewhere listening in...........

      ok, so there were german visitors scheduled for supper at trc....and i made/planned a meal made up of my memories....for starts...a meats platter like the one that scw had at the hotel silberdistal in lambsheim ( the town of my great grandfather....).......it was many kinds of cold meats and pates...with pickles and a shot of schnapps...the eldest madame stephan who was present when we visited 3 years ago also ordered this platter....and she downed the schnapps quickly.......anyway...i was challenged to put together a german menu for these folks....and i went with what i knew......the meats/pickled product plates.......then butter-sauteed trout, and sweet/sour red cabbage.......creamed spinach ( my own recipe) and spatzle...then my grandmother's apple kuchen.....mit schlagg...........ah well....i am not there for the dinner......but i hope it goes well.....as it turns out...these visitors are from the old east germany...no chance to swap stories about lambsheim.........

      ok, so the song that is in my head today was first parodied in ferris bueller's day off.....cameron sang it to himself as he lay in bed...listening to ferris on the machine......when israel was in egypt's land...let my cameron go......he sang.......in my head...it is let my kathy go.....i want to move on now, not later...........  When Israel was in Egypt's Land, Let my people go, Opressed so hard they could not stand, Let my people go.   Chorus Go down, Moses, Way down in Egypt's Land. Tell ol' Pharoah, Let my people go.  Thus saith the Lord, bold Moses said, Let my people go, If not, I'll smite your first-born dead, Let my people go.    there are many more stanzas and choruses, but i am too tired for these to sully my brain......i stick with the first stanza, and repeat, repeat, repeat.................

      ok, os i liked this poem, especially the last few lines....by the way, my mother was a broughton.....maybe we are distantly related....  Poem: "Having Come This Far," by James Broughton, from Packing up for Paradise.  Black Sparrow Press. Reprinted with (w/0) permission.   Having Come This Far  I've been through what my through was to be I did what I could and couldn't I was never sure how I would get there  I nourished an ardor for thresholds for stepping stones and for ladders I discovered detour and ditch  I swam in the high tides of greed I built sandcastles to house my dreams I survived the sunburns of love  No longer do I hunt for targets I've climbed all the summits I need to and I've eaten my share of lotus  Now I give praise and thanks for what could not be avoided and for every foolhardy choice  I cherish my wounds and their cures and the sweet enervations of bliss My book is an open life  I wave goodbye to the absolutes and send my regards to infinity I'd rather be blithe than correct  Until something transcendent turns up I plash in my poetry puddle and try to keep God amused

      ok, so somebody today asked me just what i wanted to do with the rest of my life.....should some sainted individual/group of investors see fit to set kcw free...........i was thinking more of  who  i want to be...........rick steves comes to mind......as does anna quindlan..peter mayle,...and david eggars.......all writers...........or traveler/writers...........the problem with this fantasy is one of logistics.........i cannot sit at this computer terminal for more than 20 or so minutes before my back hurts........and so i am a serial surfer/brief blogger...........a little here or there....not for very long....decidedly not long enough to really get down to business......i gave my laptop to andrew when he went back to school last year....so he could write......and i will not ask for it back.......i will just hope that someone has a discarded out-of-date windows 98 kind of laptop in a closet that they no longer need........and that the price is right when it comes my way..........until then i will work in 20 minute snatches..........

      ok, so my sister-in-law had a 'snapshot' of george and laura on her refrigerator......it really looked like something she just picked up from the walmart film-developing counter........and so we asked her about it.....out of idle curiosity......'oh, she said.....the republicans sent it when they asked for money........but i didn't sent them any.........well, that much goes without saying with my sister-in-law....but the snapshot has disturbed me........so many gullible folks out there.....who might just believe that george sent them  personally  a cozy picture of his little family from down at the ranch....where they live out their fine conservative family values every day, and twice on sunday.........and many will surely mail george a check....because his wife is so nice.....or george is so cute......yuck......how can people not see that he is an egomaniac with nothing more on the ball than good ole boy connections............he may be nice.....but in my opinion he is dangerously stupid.........

      ok, so i am enjoying the veritable daylights out of my sitemeter....which tells not as much as i would like to know about who reads my blog....but enough to be continually entertained and diverted........for instance......my blog was visited today by a person who entered  urlLink 'ken griffey jr 's private life' into his search engine........i did blog about listening to the red's play in hopes of hearing the big 500th hit......and so his name was cached in with my blog.....ha....as if i know or care about his private life......and then i was visited by someone in new zealand looking up jan ulrich's racing schedule....why? because i blogged about the  urlLink tour de france..... and jan ulrich's name was cached in with my blog.........i do wish i knew jan......i could get his autograph for my spouse......and then there are the people looking for  urlLink porn ......from places at greenwich mean time....or baghdad/moscow time...... urlLink searching for  ...get this........photos of the  urlLink mamma of girls ........ha....i should have directed them to our pesky  urlLink 'granny site'  that won't leave our history.....after seeing broads they may sour on seeing anymore american babes.........there was actually someone looking for 2f urlLink meanmamma ...whatever that means........they were also greenwich mean time.......and someone in mountain time zone was looking for 'handdrawn'.....which rings no bells as far as i can recall.........i must be easily amused...............

      ok, so i am going to report on this  urlLink wedding  in the most positive way that i can........maybe by the numbers.....1- the  urlLink happy couple  kate and joe......clearly meant for each other.....also the number of blue jaguar's my sister-in-law lisa now owns....i am jealous....also the number of veggie trays set out on the 'appetizer' table (the caterer's note said veggies for 50...250 were present....) also the number of boxes of donuts set out on my sister-in-law's counter at the brunch today........2-the number of times we got lost/turned around...despite the fact that my spouse is a native to cincinnati and i lived there for 4 years.....2-is also the number of  urlLink catering staff  people who doled out meat at the buffet.........no comment on that from this  urlLink caterer ..... also the number of new 'stories' i heard from extended family of 23 years......they were great stories, by the way......3-the number of tables doled out to the weber part of the family.......also the number of cheese trays i helped lisa set up just before the reception.....do not ask why we were setting out homemade cheese trays when a caterer had been hired......also the number of  urlLink kegs of beer  behind the bar.......4- the number of starch side dishes on the buffet......and apparently the number of bottles of  urlLink white wine  purchased by my sister-in-law(the mother-of-the-bride) in ky despite the fact that lisa's husband is a wine wholesaler..........luckily, lisa brought a cooler with better  urlLink wine ,for family, just in case.....)....5- the number of bridesmaids, the number of groomsmen.....6+- the number of christmas wreaths that decorated the tables........and matched the pineneedle/pinecone motif of the  urlLink wedding cake .....AND the number of christmas wreaths that my spouse declined (politely) to take home with us in case we might want to use them in catering.....priceless..........the chat i had with the father-of-the-bride...who has been estranged from the rest of us since my mother-in-law's funeral........i am so glad to have gotten all that behind the two of us, at least.......also priceless...the chance to catch up with my spouse's siblings....who i basically love and adore....despite number 1-6..........

      ok, so 4 out of 5 of us will be piling into the car this afternoon to go to cousin kate's wedding in cincinnati.....and the big question will surely be.....where is acw?........and my answer will be...he had to work....and then i will change the subject........when children no longer live at home.....they can no longer be cajoled into things like attending cousin kate's wedding........they can barely be urged gently into coming home for birthdays, mother's day...etc.......ah well....such is the process of letting them leave the nest.........

      ok, so our  urlLink pets  are becoming incredibly needy......curiously helpless at times......i was awakened this morning by the cat howling downstairs........she was sitting primly at her food dish, and i was surprised to discover that it was full, not empty.....she immediately started eating.... urlLink just wanted an audience  for her breakfast ritual, i suppose......then the dog started crying at the backdoor.......wanting in....this from the  urlLink dog  who would just sit quietly at the door.....expecting someone inside to just know that he wanted in......or  urlLink out ......now he is just senile enough that he will sit and howl on the deck.....like he cannot remember how to get in the house........and the  urlLink big yellow dog ?.....right now he is at basecamp 2/ urlLink next door  getting his nicotine fix,  urlLink eating heartily ....he'll come home about supper time here........big baby..the good news is that they all appear to be  urlLink getting along  these days......

      ok, so i found a book to read at the library yesterday......incidents in the rue langier.....by anita brookner......i have purchased another book by the same author...twice......hotel du lac.....which won the booker prize.......anyway.....the first part is about how the narrator finally gets around to reading her mother's diary....and how it sheds light on the woman who said so little during her life........curious.......as i have read through recently letters that both grandmothers wrote to me when i was in college......they say little about the women they were........my grandmother crown never learned to drive....yet voted democrat despite the republicans who drove her to the polls.......i have her oak buffet......and if need be...i could probably make homemade noodles on my counter using the method i absorbed from watching her years ago.............i have yet to figure out how she made her orange juice cookies........anyway...i clearly remember her berating my father......in the year my mother'went back to work' for not doing more to get supper on the table.......she said...'herb.....if you get home first you COULD put on the potatoes....'.......and i can say honestly that i never really knew her.........and then there was my grandmother clara adele stephan broughton....quite the spoiled child....being the youngest...and 20 years younger than her oldest sibling.........i could say that i learned the art of drama from her......she could really put on a show if she desired.........but i digress .......my memories of my grandmothers are just that.... memories....nothing concrete in print...nothing definitive.......yet i have left a body of work in my blog. 1450 blogs.......that really does not contain my most personal thoughts...because i am not likely to disclose my most personal thoughts in a public venue........so my children will have to discern my most private thoughts by reading between my lines..........ah well.....1450 blogs...and still no honesty..........can they say that they knew me well?..........

      ok, so this was on writer's almanac this morning.....must have been the poet's birthday.........i like this sentiment....  Poem: "Album," by Ron Padgett, from You Never Know.  Coffee House Press.    Album  The mental pictures I have of my parents and grandparents and my childhood are beginning to break up into small fragments and get blown away from me into empty space, and the same wind is sucking me toward it ever so gently, so gently as not even to raise a hair on my head (though the truth is that there are very few of them to be raised). I'm starting to take the idea of death as the end of life somewhat harder than before. I used to wonder why people seemed to think that life is tragic or sad. Isn't it also comic and funny? And beyond all that, isn't it amazing and marvelous? Yes, but only if you have it. And I am starting not to have it. The pictures are disintegrating, as if their molecules were saying, "I've had enough," ready to go somewhere else and form a new configuration. They betray us, those molecules, we who have loved them. They treat us like dirt.

      ok, so yesterday was a big blogging day, which essentially means i was having a rough day and needed the  urlLink therapy  of writing down my thoughts  urlLink in order to get by ....make no mistake...... urlLink writing down thoughts , especially stray thoughts, has been so  urlLink freeing to my brain .......and a  urlLink comfort .....once written they can be  urlLink revisited and rethought , and possibly  urlLink understood  on a manner not possible on the day in question.......i also had a banner day figuring out my sitemeter.......there were at least 6 repeat readers yesterday.......those who entered the site via the direct web address, and not through archives...which meant that they either located the blog through a search engine, or happened upon it by searching for a word or phrase.....speaking of words or phrases.....we now have a filthy site stuck in our history because somebody typed in a witty phrase as a web address.........i am assured that it was not a deliberate search for porn, because the phrase is a recurring catch phrase.....part of a set of phrases that are frequently used these days in our house.....and certainly not one that i would have bet would lead to porn.......and now i cannot get rid of it......it will have to fade as it is disused,.....i suppose.........suffice it to say....i had no idea that there were women who would do things like that........oh my.......anyway, i won't link it, as i link so many other things, like  urlLink cartoons  or  urlLink articles ......that i enjoy.....gentle readers......i trust that you are as entertained by  urlLink reading  this blog as i am amused and amazed by writing it...... urlLink

      ok, so i am going to go on record about my father-in-law, now that i am sitting at a computer screen watching the reds play the rangers, and hoping that ken griffey jr breaks 500 home runs.........nick weber.... had 3 memorable rants.....one was about the hawks that hung out in the median near the georgetown exit......the second was about cars driving north on i-75....he knew they were driving north from florida.......and he was dead-opposed to the tearing down of riverfront stadium to build the new stadium......especially since he lived near the old field.....that they tore down to build riverfront...........crosley field...maybe.........it stood about the same place where the 23.1 mile marker was when i finished my marathon........anyway....it is crazy for one town to have 3 baseball stadium sites in living memory.....but that is cincinnati..........here's hoping that ken griffey jr does his dad proud...............

      ok so this song was in my head today....now it is out....  jackson brown.....  Im going to rent myself a house In the shade of the freeway Im going to pack my lunch in the morning And go to work each day And when the evening rolls around Ill go on home and lay my body down And when the morning light comes streaming in Ill get up and do it again Amen Say it again Amen  I want to know what became of the changes We waited for love to bring Were they only the fitful dreams Of some greater awakening Ive been aware of the time going by They say in the end its the wink of an eye And when the morning light comes streaming in Youll get up and do it again Amen  Caught between the longing for love And the struggle for the legal tender Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring And the junk man pounds his fender Where the veterans dream of the fight Fast asleep at the traffic light And the children solemnly wait For the ice cream vendor Out into the cool of the evening Strolls the pretender He knows that all his hopes and dreams Begin and end there  Ah the laughter of the lovers As they run through the night Leaving nothing for the others But to choose off and fight And tear at the world with all their might While the ships bearing their dreams Sail out of sight  Im going to find myself a girl Who can show me what laughter means And well fill in the missing colors In each others paint-by-number dreams And then well put out dark glasses on And well make love until our strength is gone And when the morning light comes streaming in Well get up and do it again Get it up again  Im going to be a happy idiot And struggle for the legal tender Where the ads take aim and lay their claim To the heart and the soul of the spender And believe in whatever may lie In those things that money can buy Thought true love could have been a contender Are you there?  Say a prayer for the pretender Who started out so young and strong Only to surrender  i have no idea why......i haven't really thought of that song for 30 years.......

      ok, so one of the big 4 networks...(?fox. abc?) intends to launch a show this fall called wife swap............who can make this stuff up.......it may be everyone's fantasy....but my puritanical upbringing forbids me to consider the notion..........i have a hard time contemplating the format........do the newly paired couple fall out in the first episode over the toothpaste...........or the sorting of whites and darks in the laundry........or the taking out of trash......or the purchase of more books.......even used books..............anything less is false and unbelievable........and certainly not worth watching.........my spouse's friends are not attractive in their swapping mode.....as i have known them long enough to see their downsides......and i am quite sure that these enlightened men could not handle the mm............ha.......

      ok, so  urlLink medicare  has agreed to cover the cost of a pet scan for alzheimer's disease......which is a little too late for some.....my dad was totally confused by the time he qualified for medicare.......and had he not retired early, he would have missed out on retirement in it's essentials altogether.....my mother finally figured out something was wrong when they were climbing ayre's rock......i want to do the same....god willing......but i am not sure that i want to know at age 48 that i am getting senile.....ti is one thing to suspect and another thing to actually know......

      ok, so i was able to track down my own ip address.......by reading somebody else's blog....and sneaking a peak at her sitemeter.......the blog that i read out of washington dc is quite illuminating......i thought the person involved....was a neo-quasi bimbo...until i read her review of troy, complete with her minor-in-classics opinions.....i was impressed....also by her sitemeter....which includes mostly house.gov.......she is read widely on the hill.........i love it........anyway......my internet access is listed under qwest.....which i took to be a california-based interest access company...given it's website.....until i figured out that there are those in my own community who are metered under qwest......who knew............so i am completely confused as to who reads my blog........somebody with bellsouth......and somebody with qwest..........and somebody with a numbered account(swiss?) who only stayed 15 seconds, but who has been back numerous times without a measured visit.........ah well.....i am learning as i go along...............

      ok, so exactly what do these search engines do when they blip by my blog for less than a measurable second......is it like a recon plane swooping down low but not actually landing....and hence they take data that isn't recorded as being taken ......photographing of my words by a telephoto lens............leaving no trace....like sherlock holmes and the dog that didn't bark in the night..............i am getting off-track here.......but this is so frustrating..............

      ok, so this is NOT a nutrition blog.....in fact...i seldom talk nor think about nutrition.......mostly because i am discouraged about the new wave of pro-atkins dieters......and am not inclined to go up against the mania.......last night, at our annual twinkie run....a running community race/walk that is based on actual time versus predicted time for a 5k or 10k course.......the twinkie part is just about the traditional dessert course to the post race pot-luck.....anyway....i walked my part of the event with 2 female lexington lawyers.........who had ketosis breath...........gentle readers.....ketosis...or acidosis...is an abnormal metabolic state brought on by a low carb diet.....people in ketosis have breath that smells like fingernail polish remover.......and their blood, when it is so acidic, cannot hold oxygen as efficiently...so they have to breathe quickly to the point of panting.......anyway......i bit my tongue, and made no mention of this...even when they sat with me at dinner....and i could see by their plates that they were on the low carb diet........i kept my comments toward books, marriage, and parenting.....much safer topics than atkins......even when i was the only one in the group still on her first go-around........anyway, back to diet....there was an excellent article in yesterday's  urlLink time  by dr. dean ornish.....who i have had the priviledge to meet.....he has researched and  written extensively on lowfat diets for weight loss and reversal of heart disease......i heard him debate THE dr. atkins at the american dietetics association meeting 3-4 years ago.......at which time he unveiled a decade of heart health/weight loss research data involving thousands of people....and dr. atkins revealed that he had only ever studied a group of 6 adolescent boys for 6 months....but they lost weight.......gentle readers.......weight loss with atkins is due to dehydration that comes on because of the need of the body to rid itself of ketones through increased urine output.....the body's metabolic rate slows way down....which explains why people who go on this crazy regime always gain more weight back than they lose......needless to say....we are having leftover pasta salad tonight for dinner because the low carb crazies wouldn't eat it.......i should mention that none of the actual runners are into low carb...they couldn't manage to keep up if they did.......it is only the spouses/roommates/lovers who do such things.....ah well....meanmamma has had her say...............

      ok, so i am having either an overly emotional day, or i am simply menopausal.....and i like neither prospect......i started crying on the phone talking to my friend joe the produce guy...who expressed surprise that i was griping vehemently about a customer who has bitched daily for the past 2 weeks about something or another.......he said...kathy, you never get mad and you never use the word bitch let alone complain over the phone.....but if this is a sign of what you are like when you are upset i hope i am not there for that day....' he was joking, but i took it personally.....and there you go.....and once i started crying, i couldn't seem to stop.........think about isengard when the dam broke.......i know in my heart that i need to start thinking of positive things.....and look for the glass half-full instead of f..king empty..........but i cannot do so at this little minute............

      ok, so our eldest showed up at the bike shop yesterday morning, deathly sick and needing an appointment at the doctor......by midafternoon he was reportedly home on the couch, taking antibiotics, sipping broth, etc........strep is suspected, and though i understand the overuse of antibiotics, i am glad that the doctor went ahead and prescribed the miracle drug.......i stopped and bought popsicles.....my sick-day food of choice.....they do so soothe a sore throat.......thinking back to my own recent sick-day-off.....i recall the santuary that is one's own sofa.......a true haven when push comes to shove.......another sofa, in another house...somewhere off isn't the same.......

      ok,s o james joyce is on my too-read list, but i haven't gotten around to it......for the record....today is the day that joyce immortalized....in fact the hundredth anniversary of june 16, 1904, the day that Leopold Bloom, a Jewish ad salesman who lives on the north side of Dublin wandering around doing errands. , from writer's almanac 'In the morning, he leaves his house on 7 Eccles Street, walks south across the River Liffey, picks up a letter, buys a bar of soap, and goes to the funeral of a man he didn't know very well. In the afternoon he eats a cheese sandwich, feeds some gulls in the Liffey, helps a blind man cross the street, and visits a couple of pubs. He thinks about his job, his wife, his daughter, his stillborn son; he muses about life and death and reincarnation. He knows that his wife is planning to cheat on him that afternoon at his house, and he spends a lot of time thinking about the days when his marriage was happier. ' though the day will be observed around the globe...this year's Dublin 'Bloomsday has been extended into a five-month festival from April to August, full of Joyce exhibitions at museums, plays, songs, reenactments of scenes from Ulysses, academic conferences, and James Joyce look-alike contests. Today, June 16th, thousands of people will retrace the steps of Leopold Bloom as he made his way through the streets and pubs of Dublin.'  in some ways, this book sounds like an elaborate blog.......which essentially traces the writer's steps through both the etheral and the mundane........ironically, with the potential of a worldwide audience i am unlikely to elaborate on personal issues......so mm's blog is at it's root, my life without the details that would make it a joycean novel.......which is ok, because i was really aiming for an austen-like life.........

      ok, so today the  urlLink budweiser  people sent by two delightful octgenarians to check our  urlLink beer  for freshness........they had clipboards, and dutifully noted each unopened case date as well as chilled bottle date......and assured us that the  urlLink beer  would be consumed before the expiration date...for the record......they noted any  urlLink beer  over 70 days old.......i cannot imagine that  urlLink beer  goes bad as noticibly as milk or juice....but i suppose that  urlLink beermakers   urlLink do not want to take any chances........

      ok, so i am not really into  urlLink zen ......but being my own  urlLink personal webmaster  is getting interesting.....i urlLink  finally learned  how to install a  urlLink sitemeter .......so i can tell if anybody actually reads this stuff......and they do...yesterday somebody read 5 pages over three different visits that lasted over 60 minutes....somebody read for 2.5 minutes, somebody for 51 seconds.....and about 12 people glanced at the entry page and moved on.....of course.....i am most upset about those who moved on....what is there not to like-these hits were from all over.....one from south africa......ha!  for the record, the sitemeter ingores my own personal 'addresses'.......and is vague about the last three digits of the ip address.......meaning that i know that the extended reader was in town somewhere.....i just know that it was not my own address......either at work or at home........so anonymity is preserved for those  urlLink readers who crave anonymity .........anyway.......back to the  urlLink 51 second-hit ....it was from a non-commercial server/domain......and not a dot-com place.......curious..........and just how can one savor my glorious prose in just 51 seconds............if i was into  urlLink zen .....i wouldn't  urlLink worry  myself about these details,  urlLink now would i ?

      ok, so i am enjoying the latest issue of outside magazine....which is dedicated to the tour de france......starts july 3 and i personally cannot wait........my mother tapes each stage on oln...and then we watch it with one day's delay................furiously rushing through the lance suburu commercials.......and trying not to read newspaper or online commentary about the goings-on......this is difficult when big things happen...like jan ulrich having a major wreck......anyway.......i have been around bike racing long enough to know who has been on what team at some point....maybe not the specific year......but at some point.....and this is good.....we sit back with a beer.....and just enjoy the drama........and phil liggett and paul sherwin...the oln commentators....they are a real trip.....for so many years...they are like baseball commentators....they remember every stage of every race......and who did what....it si amazing...........i once dated briefly the food service director at jewish hospital in cincinnati...he was really into baseball....and good food...and he once asked me to both a baseball game and dinner at la maisonette...but i declined...because he was not my type.........and because he apptempted to date all the dietitian interns that came his way.....but that is beside the point.............so...can lance win a 6th time.....can tyler hamilton, who owns an apartment directly above lance's in girona, spain......come through this year....he is, by the way...from the boston area......and used to be a college skier before he took up cycling.......will jan ulrich, the german telecom fellow get by 5 straight 2nd place finishes....to win finally.......and there are so many others who could do it....the basque team folks.....the dutch....and italians.....the french, for heaven's sake...............but lance is in some sort of zone, now that he has divorced his wife and taken up with his hippie-chick girlfriend/rockstar and is living on the edge..............who knows.....regardless...i cannot wait till july 3........

      ok, so i dug out the anniversary glasses just now.....a pair of belle epoque flutes that we received along with a bottle of perrier et jouet from my roommate when we got engaged.....on our 3 week european camping trip/honeymoon( i did say that i was a quasi neo-hippie.....) we went to epernay (sp?) and toured moet and chandon and attempted the same at perrier er jouet, but they don't do tours.....and they don't like to sell their champagne to just anyone....but i explained that we had the glasses.....and the receptionist condescended to sell us 2 bottles.........(we also had several bottles of dom perignon in the car...we paid less than $15 per bottle, by the way....but this was 23 years ago....., and we did not tell her that.......) we came through customs with 9 bottles total...including a few we purchased in pouilly...........so those bottles lasted us through several anniversaries..................and then we started in on the domestics........difficult for one who lives in a dry county.....and then there was the year that my in-laws were coming down from cincinnati for our anniversary weekend. and to go to the band festival......and they offered to bring us a bottle....and it turned out to be cold duck....which i refused to drink....which caused a fuss....that bottle is till in our basement refrigerator.......no one will open it or remove it......if and when this house ever sells.....that bottle will go with the lot................today we are having a bottle of sofia, by francis ford coppola........a few steps up at least.......we served this wine at our champagne tasting a while back.....it comes in pink cellophane......though i am not so sure that i like sofia coppola all that much....i have read that both she and bill murray snubbed scarlett johannson when they made lost in translation....(gail and i read people faithfully.......) and i was disappointed to hear this...........)for the record....we are having chinese carryout as well celebrate our 23rd anniversary and acw's 20th birthday (tomorrow)......a treat for cook and family alike.......

      ok, so rain was the main theme yesterday.......we had just commented that it rains every time we cater the herb festival, and the clouds seemed to darken and burst forth as if by my command......rain is not good for business at outdoor events......we were undercover. but our potential patrons were not.....and as gail and i already know everything worth knowing about each other....we grilled our berea college intern who was helping out about his personal life to pass the time........poor guy.......we mostly took him to task for not being a registered voter, for liking rap and heavy metal, and for watching television rather than reading in his spare time.......on the way home the weather got really scarey.......heavy rain with churning winds make me really nervous....at one point i pulled over to the side of the road.....and gail and i debated whether one should stay in the car or get out of the car if there is a tornado sighted.......we had to unload the car in the rain, and then start in immediately on the carryout orders......which were pickups rather than deliveries.......gentle readers.....making carryout deliveries in the rain to band festival patrons who are not at their reserved tables because of the rain is a frustrating endeavor that we wisely opted against this year......we were fairly busy last night, with a dinner crowd that was in no hurry to give up dry, cozy tables, despite the bands playing just 2 blocks away.......today looks to be clearer.....and thankfully we are only open until 2.......there are no words that can decribe my current level of exhaustion......i wonder if i can sneak a nap in before dinner tonight............

      ok, so this poem about being old is so sad.....  When You Are Old by William Butler Yeats, from Collected Poems of William Butler Yeats.   When you are old and gray and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, take down this book, And slowly read, and dream of the soft look Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true; But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face.  And bending down beside the glowing bars Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

      ok, so i need to post about bookclub......partly because i drank red wine........the host drinks red, and the white was going to be too sweet......it was ok......anyway.....the book discussion was handled expertly......we simply were not allowed to stray from his script.....it was the benediction that i found troubling....our host found it necessary to read from a memoir of a man who died from cancer.....(einstein's dreams....)despite the fact that he invited larry f.'s widow to the event........and she cried through his reading.....and we all went home bummed out........why would he do this.................i was already bummed out that when i hugged her she was so boney that i was afraid that she would break.....gentle readers........woman should never get to this point..........

      ok so awhile back, as my spouse and i were walking after dinner.....and talking about  the future in general.....and he was discussing my strengths....and what he could see me doing with the rest of my life.............housewifery was not included in the list........and when i conceded that i was not much of a housewife...he did not argue against the point......gentle readers.....this point should be disparaging for someone with an undergraduatedegree in home economics.............but i am no martha stewart..............i know no recipes......as i use none............i simply add ingredients as it seems fit.......and i do not dust, nor wax......and i have children to vacumn.........i DO throw away, which separates me from my kin...........but he is right.....i have no future as a stepford wife...............on the other hand, he gives me substantial credit as an accomplished traveler, who will always know where to go, where ever....i may be.........if i could only make myself write fiction............we would be getting someplace.............

      ok, so today, my quasi-neo-hippie hostess/waitress/friend who will be a senior at centre this fall.......was fussing about this guy she has been intimate with lately.....who just told her that he is split with his girlfriend but that they still live together/sleep together.....and so she is trying to break it off with him......and he shows up at the restaurant.....and it is a classmate of my eldest................who i have known since forever.................and i was horrified...and had to leave the room because it was all-of-a sudden too much information for me......when she had told him he was a jerk...and he left.....i asked her if she was aware that the girlfriend was meanasasnake...and going to school on military/rotc money....and that she would basically beat her senseless if she knew she was sleeping with her boyfriend.....even though we saw this same girl escort numerous fellows to her apartment when she used to live next to the restaurant......ah well.....too much information......i must be getting old.........

      ok, so mm is HOME ALONE....and that explains the plethora of posts.....i could vacumn, do laundry....clean out the gutters.....but as it is raining......i am preparing for bookclub by looking over a book i actually read 6-7 months ago.....the flanders panel by arturo perez-reverte.....at the get-go.....you really must take notice of a book by a hyphenated author.......i must include this insight tonight with all of my non-hyphenated friends........i also enjoyed the madrid backdrop......i enjoyed madrid vicariously in this novel more than i did when i visited last year.......but then i was tired/cold/jet-lagged.....the story of my travel life.......anyway....this book reminded me of emberto eco's the name of the rose....a historical thriller....with many twists.......requiring reat attention to detail.....especially to chess.....and this is where i was lost in translation.......i only know enough about chess to lose dramatically........and this book convinced me that i probably have adult add....because when the chess game diagrams popped up....i could no longer focus on the story at hand.........it is the same when i try to read war and peace.. or the brothers karamozov.......and the russian names come up....i cannot focus....and so my mind wanders....and i am soon writing shopping lists in my head rather than reading the book.........thus, i have never finished a russian novel......or a polish,czech,indian......you name it......i cannot get through these without my mind wandering.....and i always put them down....and never put them back up...........on theother hand i managed to read the davinci code in less than 24 hours.......and though i have reread it to make sure it caught the drift correctly.....i think that i have a phobia to unfamiliar words...........i must be careful at bookclub, because the person who chose this book has a bad heart..........

      ok, so mm wants to thank her  urlLink friend gail  for taking the time....lots of time to catch up on the  urlLink blogs  she missed after her daughter took the family  urlLink computer  to college........we are talking 6+ months of blogs.......it was nice to relive some of the moments with her as she reminded me of events that i  urlLink chronicled  ages ago.......she even asked if i had actually had a good time in  urlLink paris  in january, because i sounded either  urlLink bored , or  urlLink tired , or  urlLink both .......for the record, i was  urlLink jet-lagged and wet and cold .......but i remember having a good time........or maybe it was just the typing onto an unfamiliar computer in a smoky cybercafe........anyway, welcome back, gail........

      ok, so i have enjoyed  urlLink cartoons  since my days reading mad magazine in the 60's..........i offer these  urlLink travel  related cartoons because i am not going anywhere fun anytime soon......to weddings....to conventions...but nowhere remotely  urlLink interesting ......i really wish i was going to  urlLink paris  soon, but eleven visits thus far is getting mighty greedy.........in had to include this  urlLink one ...just because........i understand that petra is traveling in france as we speak........bon voyage ma petit ami............

      ok, so ky senator mitch mcconnell has announced that he will try to change the $10 bill to a picture of  urlLink reagan ........ha!...carter's got a nobel peace prize...surely that deserves a spot on our money more than a trickle down  urlLink republican ......especially when i didn't see $10 in  urlLink trickle down  cash over his 8 year tenure....... maybe this just  urlLink sums  it up.......

      ok, so i like this  urlLink cartoon  it would be appropriate for someone offed by the mob......or so i suppose.......not actually knowing anyone that the mob would care to off.......ok, so it is small.......it is a headstone carved to look like a toaster....and the headstone says simply 'toast'.......nyuck nyuck...this  urlLink one  is funny, too...and this one  urlLink sums it all up ......

      ok, so my original  urlLink baseball fantasy  involved the cubs versus boston......my revised fantasy involves the boston redsox and cincinnati reds.......more likely given current records......and more interesting despite the curse......redsox versus reds........i live close enough that i might get to a game......my  urlLink spouse  is a longtime reds fan

      ok, so a short time ago,i was taken to task over my personal review of lotr/rotk.......ironically, we came across the new yorker issue in which the original review of said movie is included...the reviewer....anthony lane is droll in his approach to review....."indeed there is a body of opinion that we (critics) should carry little bells, like lepers in the middle ages, to warn respectable citizens of our foul approach.....'such is the lot of critics........everybody has an opinion, and everybody loves your opinion as long as it is alike their own.............i have already selected my little bell.....i simply lack the perfect leperous outfit to complete it.........

      ok,so the cincy playhouse has won a tony award for regional theatre.......i lived not 1 block away in the late 70's......my roommate and i bought 2 season tickets in hopes that we could find willing dates for at least half the performances.......i do not recall sucess.......i recall seeing every performance with my roommate cynthia...who was also my maid of honor......ah well...the theatre experience was good........

      ok, so i have run out of books on tape at the library that intrigue me......so i have digressed to books that i own on tape.....one such is a year in provence......a syrupy nostalgic look at the rehab of a country stone house in the wilds of the luberon........structurally, i can learn a lot about the kind of book i have in mind........but i have hard time with the particulars........in my own personal experience......i hated the south of france.........we came through on our 3 week honeymoon........on a drive from the bas-alps.....chamonix (sp) where we had a fabulous meal, but where i needed all of my french to avoid being cheated out of 100x the price agreed on the room and meal........i got out my camera and took pictures...there is nothing so discouraging to gougers as photographic evidence.......anyway.....i can recall our drive through the luberon.....hot, dusty.......and st. tropez......rode hard and hung up wet....as they say around here.....and the drive to avignon.......well.....i was glad to make it to the chablis area.......we stayed near pouilly-fuisse (sp) which i remember fondly..............that was 23 years ago........hard to believe that i have not been further south in france than lyon in 23 years..........well that is not true, as i drive across the border from the tip of france near honnderribbia in the basque area....but being lost does not count..........

      ok, so my mother has called to ask if had gotten mail or a danville paper......and she wondered whether there would be mail or paper service for the week of mourning.........gentle readers.....if there is a week of mourning........then i will nto be responsible for my actions.......i assured her that incredibly both mailperson and paperperson must be sick ,and their replacements are behind.........we had a tag on our door that advised us that a fedex package had not been delivered because no one was at home.....and we could a)drive to frankfort and pick it up today....or b)sign the ticket and it would be delivered tomorrow.........i am not driving anywhere for anything today..........no mail, no paper, no fedex........what is this country coming to.......

      ok, so first thing this morning, in a driving rain, we ventured back into town, parked at the restaurant, and walked on down to centre for the closing ceremony of governor's scholars program.................said ceremony took forever......... of course.....just to pass out 335 certificates took over 30 minutes...................and then the loading up of the cars in utter gridlock took forever.........the 3 trips with armloads of stuff down countless flights of (wet slippery)stairs.........and then the sidetrip to get chinese carryout................so finally he is home............talking a mile-a-minute to his older brother about the experience...................and i am not at the restaurant....................we pulled right out of that parking lot, and drove away.............and didn't look back...............

      ok, so we had a blast having dinner and drinks with our good friends the morgans and the hempels- listening to our good friend colin's band billy blues..............colin gave me grief from the get-go because 'i was not keeping up' with him..........to which i replied.........'it is not book club at my house...........so i will just stick to a few glasses of wine..............'the band dedicated the following robert johnson song to me........  come on in my kitchen........  Mmm... you better come on in my kitchen babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoorsThe woman I love, took from my best friendSome joker got lucky, stole her back againYou better come on in my kitchen babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoorsOh, she's gone, I know she won't come backI've taken the last nickel out of her nation sackYou better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors[Spoken:] Oh, can't you hear that wind howl?Can't you hear that wind howl?You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoorsWhen a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her downLookin' for her good friend, none can't be foundYou better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoorsWinter time's comin', it's goin' to be slowYou can make the winter, babe, that's dry long soYou better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  you have to imagine the harmonica that went along with it............the best thing they played was brown-eyed girl by van morrison, a personal favorite..........at some point we all got up to dance...........a good time............

      ok, so for a split second i thought i saw a bluebird on the tree just beyond the deck.....whilst i was reading the danville paper and enjoying a glass of wine...................but then i knew better than that.....it had to be an indigo bunting............a smaller, vibrantly blue version that loves the cedar trees that grow wild in these parts.............i only saw the one.....which seems sad considering that all the other birds seem to be traveling in pairs these days...........we have several pairs of cardinals about...or so it seems...if they are the same pair they are quite the gadabouts.............and there was a pair of wrens within sight as i read the morning paper with coffee............so..............does an indigo bunting sighting bring as much luck as a bluebird?..................

      ok, so  urlLink tomorrow , july 31st, is the second  urlLink full moon  in the month of july....which makes it the 'blue  urlLink moon '....................though the cnn article i read denies the 'blue' part................supposedly a blue  urlLink moon  is just the same to the eye as any other  urlLink full moon ..........and the only  urlLink moon  to have a bluish or lavender cast is one seen after a volcanic eruption or a major fire.....due to the minute dust particles in the air.................we shall see.................. and the  urlLink 'once in blue moon' .......... part...simply implies that because the event doesn't come around often  urlLink it must mean something ...........we shall also see about that...............

      ok, so my days as a restauranteur are all over, except for the paperwork.....and it is only then that the champagne will flow..................my coworkers gave me a gift certificate for a nice dinner out....at beaumont inn, in mercer county/harrodsburg........i enjoyed the irony.......i rarely go out to supper, even at trc........., and so i have not been to beaumont inn in 4 solid years....i am actually going to supper at trc tonight.....with 2 other couples to hear billy blues, a local trio made up of 2 centre professors and a doctor............i have never actually been to dinner at trc since andrew graduated from high school..............2 years ago...........and certainly not since we hired the new chef...............who, by the way, wore an osu cap and football jersey in honor of my last day...................joe davis, my friend and fruit/vegetable purveyor gave me red hot chili pepper earrings..............gail gave me a frame that can hold our picture taken together.............so.................i am now home, in the afternoon, having picked cayle up at camp............and it is going to rain any minute.....so it is of no use to try to swim at this point...............i do believe that i will risk a nice nap....................

      ok, so i was more than impressed by john kerry, with his video, his patrol-boat comrades who still keep in touch, by the tribute by the man he saved, by max cleland,&nbsp; byhis daughters, and sons, and by his massage of reconciliation..........and hope................i doubt that dubya can produce such a scene on stage.................because it seems that all he will be able to bring on stage would be his war-years drinking buddies...........and his saudi friends....................

      ok, so my friend joe davis has sent small gifts inside each of his fruit/vegetable deliveries, over the past 4 days..............they come labeled.......we are to day 4.........leavin'for shor......ha!...........i will really miss him, as i have talked to him on the phone daily for the past 4 years.............he left a high pressure job to take on a produce business............so he and i have lots in common.............i am bailing out before he.......and i really hope he hangs in there................i went around at lunch and took pictures of favorite customers&nbsp;..........the judges (who are not all judges.......the true judge went to law school with sandra day o'conner, and he was instrumental in getting her to danville for centre's graduation this year....)...the professors (yes, they are both real professors....who read this blog, by the way)...............as well as my mom who came by to have a late lunch with me................in some regards it is like being at your own funeral, with people telling me how glad they are that we took the big risk 4 years ago to open up the place.............and to talk about how they will miss me.........though i am only going a few miles down the road..............i will surely not be a lady who lunches in my new career...........i can actually become a lady who exercises over lunch.....as the health department is just minutes away from the anderson-dean park, with it's lovely 2 mile walking path.................a sandwich on the way over, a book on tape....and i could start training for my alps hike on day 1....................i did take a photo of gail with my mom................my mom really likes gail, though she seems to have no idea that gail and my brother could one day become a couple.....if he would ever decide to settle down again...............hope springs eternal........yes, hope is a simple gift..................

      ok, so my new job has already given me a substantial gift...........they told me on the phone this morning that it would be ever so much more convenient for them if i did not start until august 16.....when a new pay period begins.....rather than august 9 when i said that i was available..........gentle readers.......this means 2 weeks off in the summer......in one lump...........which i have not experienced since andrew was born..............and that was 20 years ago.........and i was otherwise too engaged in having a newborn to enjoy the nuances.........part of the time we will be gone, granted......but we will be going to some of my favorite places............which include the bennington pottery factory, the crabtree and evelyn (sp) outlet in manchester,&nbsp; vt..yeh, i also like the coach outlet...........but my spouse does not........wouldn't a coach briefcase just be perfect for my new job?...............and blue mountain in the adirondacks.............we may just have to take cayle to see the grandma moses exhibit at the bennington art musuem............and maybe travel down to western mass to see norman rockwell's museum......i cannot recall that we have been there since the boys were tiny..........we were once nearly asked to leave the red lion inn in stockbridge during lunch because one or the other would not/could not stop crying.............all of these places are within a few hours drive of sister marilynn.......and she really needs to rest during the day...so we might as well take day trips...............for the next week, my mother has offered to pay me to sort out her attic.....now there is an offer............because we should probably just schedule a yard sale for that following saturday and dispose of half of what she moved from ohio..........but that would also require sedation (on her part...........) so who knows what i will do.......my spouse has also offered employment for the week catching him up on bookkeeping........and i would also like to drive up to cincinnati and visit my friend jane.............little time for leisure, when you think about it..................

      ok, so the reverend al sharpton had the very best line in his rousing address to the dnc...............in answer to a speech given by gwb last week, whereupon bush asked black americans whether the democrats took their votes for granted.....and reminded them that the republican party was the party of abraham lincoln..................sharpton reminded us all...that though lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation...............he never made good on the promised 40 acres and a mule............it was not until democrats were in office that blacks received the right to vote................'and we gonna ride that donkey as far as we can take it.'...what a great line................

      ok, so when is an afternoon nap a bad thing?..................today, it would seem........i laid myself down to read the new yorker...and woke up three hours later........feeling like i had been beat up...........gentle readers.....please remember that this week there are no children at home........and i arrive home early on wednesdays&nbsp;.............and the cyclists ride on wednesday evenings........i could theoretically have slept til 8:45 pm with nobody attempting to wake me up....................so what ever happened to the fantasy about a nice little nap, after which one wakes refreshed and energized...............whoa...............all i want to do now is to go back to bed...............

      ok, so as predicted..............the lexington health department people called to schedule an interview within hours of my verbal commitment to mercer county health department...........and i graciously declined their offer of an interview......given said previous commitment...though i briefly toyed at the opposite decision..............i could not have lived with myself if i&nbsp;backed out of the mercer county job at this point................it would have been rude......and while i am mean, i try really hard not to be rude..........so i thanked the contact person, and said that i might be interested if and when the job opens up again.........because you just never know about these things................i feel so much better...now that this dilemna is over...................

      ok, so we watched more of the convention last night....didn't tune in soon enough to hear ted kennedy or howard dean.......but i was impressed by ron reagan's plea for stem cell research funding, and his not-so-subtle jibes at an adminstration so tied to the rightwing that it can see the differences between potential life (fertilized eggs, for example) and stem cells...........with ron reagan's appearance, the republican's will have a hard time evoking the memory of ronald reagan..............especially since the remaining reagans have been so public in their disagreement with the bush administration over this issue..........on to barak.......a rising young political star who made a tremendous impact on the crowd with his good looks, passionate phrasing, and personal charisma......he reminded me of a young mlk.........he is what the democrats need to expand their base to non-committed people of color........and lastly theresa heinz kerry...........who spoke so eloquently of the american dream as seen by immigrants like herself...........maybe not as polished as hillary, but she is a force to be reckoned with...........of course, monday night's speeches were still on people's minds today at work........my octogenarian doorman, a republican.....whispered to the hostess......'i think clinton's speech really clinched the election for kerry..........'i can only hope and pray that he is right...............

      ok, so i regret that i did not have the radio on.....as i missed jimmy carter's speech at the dnc.........he missed the televised slot.........i have the utmost repect for jimmy, an author, and activist, a habitat builder, a sunday school teacher......and nobel laureate...certainly a wise voice in troubled times............i did see an interview with caroline kennedy........the remaining force in a family filled with both promise and tragedy........when asked if she work for kerry in the campaign, she replied...'i have been working for john kerry' since i was 14 years old......'she has dedicated the remainder of her public career to the nyc educational system......she is so articulate..........and then there was hillary's introduction speech............my goodness, but that woman can deliver words so effortlessly....and so poignantly......she is so well-spoken, so passionate...so insightful....so remarkable.........for the right winger's to use her as their whipping girl.......send money so we can reign in hillary.....just shows you how dense the rich can be...............last, but not least.......was bill............one of the floor reporters with a microphone later mentioned overhearing 2 delegates from ohio gasp......'god, he's good'...........yep......the man is the ultimate orator................delivery, timing, substance, charisma.........he focused on his new status as a rich man.....and went from there as to all that gwb is doing to preserve his wealth.....on the backs of middle and lower class americans...........i have to give him credit for having the guts to take that path..........but it was quite effective..........it brought that issue out into the open.........and to bill's advantage.................he never once bashed bush......though he coined quite a phrase............'strength and wisdom are not opposing values'...........................implying that while bush may be strong enough to lead us in time of war, he has not a lick of sense...................of course, we know that...............but many fools may feel compelled to vote for him 'so he can finish the job'...................ecw and our friend mark went to see farhenheit 911 last night.................he came home riled up, just like i was 2 weeks ago...............these are the days when we must talk to everybody we know...about getting out and voting....for a strong leader, who has both wisdom and sense..............and the initials jfk.....i guess this reality has eluded me...........but i think we all deserve a bit of the jfk feeling of goodness in america.............

      ok, so at least 2 folks have asked 'so how much will you be making'.......as if it is their business..............and as if it would be the deciding factor...............for the record..........no, i will not be making what i was making when i left the hospital....let me repeat...that job was hell on earth.......the strain has taken years off of my life................which makes this job appear to be more like a paid vacation..............another quotable quote from today's lunch crowd.........'kathy, you look more relaxed than i ever ever known you to be.............'...........there is something to be said for the worth of reduced stress/angst/tension...............

      ok, so the democratic convention is the ultimate waste of time and money.......given that the candidates have been decided...the platform worked out.........if the candidates wanted to rally the faithful.....for $60 mil...thye COULD have hosted 50 individualized state events........1 per day for 50 days.........no worse than 50 stump speeches...gathering the faithful in each state capital could be combined with fundraising.....which could conceivably net $60 million rather than cost $60 mil............an afternoon of security per state would spread the cost&nbsp;&nbsp;burden from a&nbsp;single host city significantly.............just an idea...........i feel sorry for those&nbsp;bostonians.....having to deal with flak-jacketed troops for the next few days..............&nbsp;

      ok, so my new boss-to-be called today.....to make sure i was really interested in the nutritionist job................"we were surprised after you left on friday that someone of your calibre wanted to work here........."...the implication being that i could certainly get a more prestigu=ious position if i wanted to drive to lexington..........gentle readers........my bruised ego really needed a boost like that.........so i will be working at the mercer county health department.........37.5 hours a week.......in casual clothing....18 minutes from the house...close enough that i might be able to drive children to school on some days.............the job itself is beenthere/donethat.....but that is ok for someone who has cooked fulltime for 4 solid years.........i'll just ease back in to the professional world.....and make the best of it...........i am pleased..............

      ok, so we will be driving up to new york this sunday..........with a detour to niagra falls......but not one&nbsp;to cooperstown......not this time around...............we went there as a side trip years ago........and we marveled that pete rose's belongings from his best season were there......but not his face on the actual walls of the hall of fame.................i bring this up now because there was a little balloon on-line this morning........testing the waters for the potential for george steinbrenner to be in the hall of fame....given his great contributions to the sport....................gentle readers...............for charlie hustle to be denied entrance to the hall of fame because he gambled on baseball, sullying it's reputation somehow....like making money off of it diminished it..............but for george to be somehow allowed in.......because he enhanced the game....by buying and selling human lives in the hopes of making money off of the sport..............how does this make any sense................&nbsp;i was intrigued ot read on-line about the induction of paul molitor to the hall of fame............i am pretty sure that i saw him play once against the reds at riverfront..............he seemed to be a passionate player..............my age, actually...from reading his bio..........which means that he is pretty darn young to be inducted...............which brings me back to my point............passionate players belong in the hall of fame......whether they were saints or not.............well.......only god himself need be the judge..................for me............i would like to see pete rose inducted on next year's ballot..................and if george steinbrenner make it there before pete.................then all hope for the future of baseball as we know it lost.....................

      ok, so we went to see the bourne supremacy..........a truly thrilling film...with a chase scene that just kept coming.........what a ride...............the only problem with it was that it wasn't the bourne supremacy........they could actually still a movie from that book, because they movie they did make had absolutely nothing to do with the book....except for the name jason bourne.......they are already making plans of the bourne ultimatum....which cannot be anything like the book at this point because they killed off the wrong people in this movie ....for the record......i did keep all of this to myself during&nbsp;our time at the theatre.......gentle readers...i once upset my spouse terribly during a viewing of the firm.....because i was so&nbsp;distressed about the needless changes&nbsp;to the novel that i kept pointing out the mistakes.............and my behavior reached annoyance status.............ah well.........my daughter is now in love&nbsp;with matt damon.........despite the reality that he is a professional killer.................&nbsp;

      ok, so today is the last saturday that i will work for some time.......at least work at trc...............and i am so glad..........i resisted the notion of opening for saturday lunch.....because saturday is errand day.......and people have too much to do to spend time sitting down for a leisurely lunch..........and so saturday lunch remains our slowest lunch day........a reality that will soon be the worry of others............there is lots of paperwork yet to finish up with my leaving......paperwork that i need not physically be in the building to read over and sign.......yes....this week will be sad.......but next saturday, when i do not have to go in to work....i will be elated............

      ok, so the interview went well........considering that i have not interviewed in recent memory.............the committee was unpredicted.........a nurse who i used to work with at the hospital........who was pleased that i remembered that she won a recipe contest for her pumpkin roll..........another nurse who was featured in a food/nutrition column i once did for the newspaper..............an administrator who had once heard me speak.......and a director who was impressed that i had done enough homework to have called my neighbor...who is the director of our local health department...to ask about the job openings, working conditions, skeletons............as well as to have called 2 different people who have worked with him...........so that is how we got started........aside from my passing out my resume and shaking hands........and putting names with faces.......the job(s) is basically doing things that i have done before......i was assured as i left that i would hear from them with an offer monday or tuesday....i just do not know for which opening.....and at this point i'll not quibble............the job is close enough that i can drive cayle to school before going to work.....there are more paid holidays in a single year than i have had off in 4 years.........and my favorite chinese carryout place is on the way home................we did not talk salary......the salary listed in the paper is actually more than i am, making now................so i will not quibble about that either..........frankly, i would consider this job to be an improvement in my quality of life...........37.5 hours a week, good benefits.....lots of days off.......low-key dress code......close to home.....no saturdays/sundays......rare evenings..........life is good........................or will be after i hear from them.........i have put by a nice bottle of champagne.......but i am saving that for when the sale of my share in the restaurant has gone through.................

      ok, so both my spouse and i have had a chance meeting with a person who has impacted our lives,,,,,,,,,without having to go to heaven to wait on our 5 people each..........last night, at the swim team banquet....a woman i knew marginally when i worked at the hospital approached me...and basically told me the same story she told my husband several days ago......she had been at swim practice one of the mornings when cayle's birth mother had been waiting for her to finish so they could go and do whatever..........and cayle's birth mother had struck up conversation, first about the revealing nature of swimsuits, and then about her concerns about the daughter who no longer lived with her.................well.....this person took it all as a personal affront, for danville, and for us in particular...and reportedly took it upon herself to tell the birth mother that her daughter could not have better parents, nor live in better surroundings, not attend better schools, and though it must have been hard to give her up...she needed to get over it.........gentle readers.....i had not looked forward to the swim&nbsp;banquet......because it is 3 hours of tedium...but i was mistaken about this year's banquet......i really needed that boost................

      ok, so this article on  urlLink enhanced military perks  is laughable........free breast enlargements,&nbsp; for oneself and one's dependents..............on the taxpayer's dime, no less........only in america do we worship massive mammaries enough to pay for them with federal funds.............gentle readers..............for my money, large breasts are nothing to wish for..............they swell up even further at the whim of hormones.......to the point that sleeping on one's stomach is much too painful for words.............their sheer extra weight causes skeletal misalignment/backaches, and the only available undergarments tend to look like souvenirs at dolly parton's theme park............when my ship comes in, i will have a breast reduction, thank you very much.....reckon the government will pay me for my unneeded 'natural tissue', so that some deserving servicewoman need not use that nasty silicon?..........just doing my part for the war effort................

      ok, so a bit more on the wedding i attended over the weekend.......the bridesmaids dresses were babyblue satin....short cocktail dresses.............nicely cut..........until you looked again...........and they were made quite shoddily.............gentle readers......satin is a bitch to sew......seams (haute couture means....good seams, by the way....) with satin must be sewn using an extra layer of tissue paper on top to keep the fabric smooth..............and the tissue removed carefully afterwards.............these seems were really gathered, and puckered.........and carelessly iron, if ironed at all..............the group in back of us in the pews....commented to his wife....are those dresses homemade?.................i am sure that they were not homemade.....just poorly made..............oh my...............i will not be going into the bridal business, despite my critique.............yes...i could do it better...but having made 1 bridal gown in addition to my own.......well....i'll not do it again unless a daughter-in-law to be asked me to do so..............then, and only then...will i come out of my self-imposed bridal gown retirement...........

      ok, so today we travel to camp nelson, near the kentucky river south of nicholasville......to the military cemetary.......my dad's ashes will find their final rest amongst other veterans........of many wars.......i believe camp nelson itself was used during the civil war and wwI, so the graveyard would have a similar history.......at the very least i am relieved that his remains will no longer be in my mother's upstairs closet...........mother, cayle and i are meeting the minister there, and we will travel on to lexington to shop afterwards.......gentle readers....the shopping part was my mother's idea...not mine........i suppose she needed something enjoyable to look forward to as a followup...........

      ok, so our water heater has died.............the third water heater in as many years.....which is ironic in that we had the first water heater for 19 years........only to burn them out quickly thereafter......at least this one died without drama.....the last one shorted out and caught fire in the middle of the night........and thanks to smoke alarms we were able to catch it before it ignited all of the boxes of stuff in the storage room in the basement........this morning i washed my hair in the sink.......cold water but with only my head wet i could handle it........tomorrow morning i must do toal immersion......and i do not relish the thought of a cold shower.............i understand that elite spas offer cold plunges to rejuvenate the skin...............ha!

      ok, so we just got home from the wedding in dc....such a lot to say about the weekend........we listened to the book...5 people you meet in heaven....on the way up.......a really good choice for driving with one's spouse, i suppose......because there was a lot to talk about..with regards to the book's notion fo heaven......that when you die, you will meet with a total of 5 people who explain your life to you....and give closure to issues that require it....so that you may finally find that everlasting peace we hear so much about.........if you have not read it, gentle readers....it is worth your time........especially if you need a good cry.......my spouse does not keep fast food napkins in his vehicle........as he eats no fast food in his car.......so there was nothing to use as i wept at the surprise ending........the mapquest directions were superb.....though we became concerned when the gw parkway detour led us through what seemed to be the pentagon parking lot......we did not get lost or turned around in locating the hotel, the church....both in view of the capital..........the wedding was lovely, karin's dress was elegantly simple, and the ceremony was brief......we did a group photo on the steps of the church....which is attached to the private catholic boy's prep&nbsp;school that matt attended.............there was a shuttle bus for the 4 block distance between the hotel and church.........we would not dream of riding 4 blocks when we could walk..........so we were somewhat late in getting to the reception......which began with an open bar, raw oysters on half shell (yes!!!!!) shrimp, crab cakes.........oh my........i ate my fill before we could get through the line to get a glass of wine.......such a long line........and then joined all of the attending inlaws/outlaws.........when it was time for round 2.....2 brother-in-laws got in line.....after taking orders..............after an eternity...they returned with everybody's beers, but without my wine....so i got up and got in line.....with one sister-in-law in tow.......apologizing because it was her spouse that forgot.............we were in line forever...when the oddest incident occured.....this young guy (late 20's-early 30's) was standing with his back to the line, beer in hand....chatting with 2 women who were at least 2-3 feet away from him.....and his body posture was menacing.........just butting up to me, but not enough to knock me over.......and this went on until i finally turned to him and said 'excuse me'...and he nearly yelled at me something about my having cut ahead of him in line...........and he basically made a scene......gentle readers......in my midwestern notions about lines......you face ahead when you are in line....and there is no 2-3 foot gap between you and the people 'next' to you in line....further....if you are in line for drinks at the bar......you generally do not have a beer in hand...........i did not ask these people if the line started in back of them because they all had drinks...........and had their back to the bar.........what greedy preppie lushes....who get back in line for drinks before they have finished their first drinks.....and have the callous gall to accuse others of being gauche............my niece ( the sister of the groom) was standing right beside the bar...and she quickly got a glass of wine for me from the bartender....ahead of everybody, by the way....and she assured me that she did not recognize any of the three (1 guy, 2 pretend-blondes in ill-suited dresses......)..so they were probably friends of the bride, and not the famiial groom..........at dinner,&nbsp; for which we were seated shortly thereafter....this crew was seated as far from the wedding party as could be.....which meant that as friends of the bride...they were not that important to her............i, of course, have replayed the scene numerous times in my brain......because i was caught utterly speechless........i was not expecting to be rudely accosted by an oafish cad....and i missed out on any witty, scathing comeback............and with my reputation for meanness to uphold.........ah well......... i have already made a plan to be person #5 in heaven for the callous-beer-drinking jerk......and i will explain that&nbsp;his failures on earth stemmed from his self-absorption.....and general snotty attitude........ &nbsp;  after the brunch this morning, we traveled back across the potomac to reston....to visit my brother....at his home.....for the first time in 7 years.........today was a sunday, even workaholics have to take a day off sometime....and all of our other family vacation visits have been midweek....when he was 'unavailable'.......so we stopped by for a total for 90 minutes........whilst he availed us of his techie toys.......flatscreen tvs......in 2 rooms....a huge collection of dvd's...alphabetized............2 huge computer screens set up with his pc&nbsp;so he can do programming on #1 and view the results on #2........and a new laptop and at least 2 pda's and several phones............and no guest room.........as the 3rd of the 'bedrooms' is now his personal gym.........this really upsets our mother.....who has never seen his house....because my brother is never available when she wants to visit....and because there is no place to sleep of she did come........again.....ah well......at least we kept our chatter to the weather, his house, his yard.....and away from politics.........  &nbsp;  so,......back home........no hot water....as we have discovered....but back home................

      ok, so ecw and i are traveling tomorrow to d.c.....and if there was one really good guess as to the identity of tom_baker......he would appreciate the following lyrics..... &nbsp; Bell Bottom Blues  by Eric Clapton  Bell bottom blues, you made me cry.I don't want to lose this feeling.And if I could choose a place to dieIt would be in your arms.  Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?I'd gladly do it becauseI don't want to fade away.Give me one more day, please.I don't want to fade away.In your heart I want to stay.  It's all wrong, but it's all right.The way that you treat me baby.Once I was strong but I lost the fight.You won't find a better loser.  Chorus  Chorus  Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye.I'm sure we're gonna meet again,And if we do, don't you be surprisedIf you find me with another lover.  Chorus  I don't want to fade away.Give me one more day please.I don't want to fade away.In your heart I long to stay. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of&nbsp;course,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my guess may be far from reality,...but the lyrics are good either way.................&nbsp;

      ok, so i fear that i may succumb to alzheimer's disease, but the following article may prove me wrong......  &nbsp;  Alzheimers often mistakenly diagnosed&nbsp;  &nbsp;  PHILADELPHIA, Pennslyvania (AP) -- Ask anyone to name a brain disease that causes dementia and eventually death, and the most likely answer you'll get is Alzheimer's disease.  Though that's one correct answer, it's not the only one. And a group meeting here this week is trying to increase medical and public awareness for other degenerative brain syndromes that are as misunderstood and underdeveloped as they are destructive to victims and families.  Frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, is an umbrella term that includes several related brain disorders. They generally strike people in their 50s -- a decade earlier than Alzheimer's typically hits -- and can take a severe financial, as well as emotional, toll on the sufferers' families. Like Alzheimer's FTD has no cure and no confirmed treatment to slow the slide into dementia. About 4.5 million Americans are believed to have Alzheimer's; the number with FTD is unclear because it is often misdiagnosed. "It's where Alzheimer's was 20 years ago in terms of the lack of recognition, information, knowledge," said Helen-Ann Comstock, chair of the Association for Frontotemporal Dementias. "This is a disease that hits at the prime of life, making it financially devastating for families and baffling and embarrassing because it's not always recognized." Just days before a major conference on Alzheimer's disease begins this weekend, families and doctors focused on FTD are gathering. "It's tough to say how many people are being inaccurately diagnosed but in all likelihood, half of the folks (with FTD) are being missed," said University of Pennsylvania neurologist Dr. Murray Grossman, a member of AFTD's Medical Advisory Council. "It's so important for us to spread the word, to make sure that we're getting accurate diagnoses, especially since we're on the cusp of potential treatments." While Alzheimer's is marked by memory loss, FTD patients retain their memories of people and events. They instead have trouble speaking and remembering words, and they may become extroverted or withdrawn, make inappropriate remarks in public, exhibit rude or childlike behavior, and appear selfish or apathetic. Sometimes compulsive behaviors develop, like walking to the same location day after day, constant hand-clapping or rubbing, or humming the same tune for long periods. The symptoms often lead to patients being misdiagnosed with a variety of disorders including Alzheimer's, stroke, bipolar disorder or depression. As a result, frontotemporal dementia can go undiagnosed for years. Comstock's husband was misdiagnosed twice with Alzheimer's before a third opinion months later concluded that he actually had Pick's disease, a type of frontotemporal dementia. At the time of his diagnosis in 1978, Craig Comstock was a 44-year-old math professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in California, a researcher and a fixture on the community charity circuit. He died seven years later, bedridden and unable to eat or drink. In an unusual move not typical of most medical meetings, families of FTD sufferers were invited to attend the Philadelphia gathering and take part in discussions to arm them with information about caring for their loved ones, Comstock said. Grossman said researchers are looking for ways to stabilize a protein in the brain that seems to degrade and disappear in these dementia sufferers. "We believe frontotemporal dementia is as common in the under-65 population as Alzheimer's disease is in the above-65 population," he said. "What we find is important not just for FTD but for patients with Alzheimer's disease."  &nbsp;  gentle readers....should you ever wonder what i, the mm, obsesses about daily at&nbsp; 3:00 am..it is the loss of her wits....as proved by both her grandmothers.....and her father............

      ok, so it has been nearly a week since i saw THE MOVIE......and i must say that i am more disturbed about the imagery now than i was when i sat in tears at the kentucky theatre.......for starts........i have never fought in a war....my dad once taught me how to shoot cans off fence posts at my grandpa's farm....once.....i would not shoot the gun again.....thus my sibling inherited valuable weaponry from both sides of the family, with no opposition from me at all........i was too young for viet nam, and too female....as the times saw the situation.......the heart throb who was a senior when i was a freshman in high school.......well, he got drafted....and when i ran into to him years later at ohio state.....he was just starting college at the time....he showed me the ring that he made in viet nam...... from a quarter....by drilling out the middle and beating the rest to fit his finger......he had so much time on his hands between the acts of violence that he would not talk about........he also seemed disappointed....because by that time heart throbs did not impress me........that, gentle readers is another story.......back to f-911.......my point is this....i have never been in a position where i was called upon, or felt pressure to...enlist..lt alone kill anybody, or brualize anybody, or torture anybody......my sibling was more than willing to enlist....and serve for 20 years.....i have never asked him if he has ever killed somebody.....because  1) i do not want to know and 2)we cannot discuss the weather with out arguing at this point.....and that is why the point made by the loyal opposition, in her blog......resonated......THE MOVIE is quite polarizing......it is very us versus them........now, for the record....i cannot see how it could have been otherwise.....and the comment on rachel's blog was well-put.....while nobody filming in d.c. came forward and comforted ms. lipscomb.......nobody in baghdad came forward and comforted the woman whose uncle's house was blown to bits........us versus them......except that some of us, especially highly ranked elected officials, have a hard time figuring out just what side they are on.....and for that i am grateful for m.moore...for having the guts to point this out............had it not been for the negative comments from the bush white house...i might never have gotten around to seeing the film............

      ok, so this is from mcsweeney's web site.....  THE BOOK  The Future Dictionary of America is a guide to the American language sometime in the future, when all or most of our country's problems are solved and the present administration is a distant memory. The book includes contributions from almost 200 writers and artists, including Kurt Vonnegut, Art Spiegelman, Stephen King, T.C. Boyle, ZZ Packer, Michael Chabon, Jeffrey Eugenides, Jonathan Safran Foer, Joyce Carol Oates, Jim Shepard, Rick Moody, Sarah Vowell, Richard Powers, Chris Ware, Jonathan Ames, Gabe Hudson, Julie Orringer, and many, many more. The book also comes with a CD, compiled by Barsuk Records, featuring new songs and rarities from R.E.M., Sleater-Kinney, Elliott Smith, Tom Waits, David Byrne, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, They Might Be Giants, Death Cab for Cutie, and many others.   THE GUARANTEE  All proceeds from the sales of this dictionary go directly to groups devoted to expressing their outrage over the Bush administration's assault on free speech, overtime, drinking water, truth, the rule of law, humility, the separation of church and state, a woman's right to choose, clean air, and every other good idea this country has ever had. These groups include the Sierra Club, America's oldest and largest grass-roots environmental organization; Common Assets, a new organization working to protect the commons; and many other specific projects relating to the 2004 electionmobilizing and educating voters, getting people to the polls, door-to-door organizing, and other efforts.  THE CONTEST  Below are a few sample definitions from The Future Dictionary of America; some others will appear here over the next few weeks. There are almost a thousand in the book, which may seem like a lot, but the wild thing about the future is this: no one knows what's gonna happen! That's why they call it "the future"! And so we are asking you to create some of your own. Please send your definition, pasted in the body of your e-mail, to: definitions@mcsweeneys.net. The contest will go on for about a month or so, at which point our elite team of definition-pickers will choose five favorites. These five winners will each receive a copy of The Future Dictionary of America, and we will post their definitions online, along with some others that catch our fancy. The 97th definition we receive will also receive a book, though that book will not be The Future Dictionary of America.   A FEW DEFINITIONS  blowkay [bloh'-kay] adj. of an attitude, typically exhibited by the electorate, that elected officials who have sexual relations outside of marriage while in office are less deserving of impeachment than officials whose decisions lead to the loss of human life. Folks say the new senator from Rhode Island is a skirt chaser, but as long as he doesn't send thousands of Americans off to die in a war on false pretenses, he's blowkay with me. RYAN BOUDINOT  No "There" There Kid, the [noh thayr thayr' kid] n. an honorific position involving one sixth-grader chosen from a national competition whose responsibility entails the public monitoring of all significant press conferences of major figures in a governing American administration. The sixth-grader, seated unobtrusively beside the politician's podium, is responsible for ringing an electronic bell when, in his or her estimation, a question asked has been entirely left unanswered. The politician speaking is then given the opportunity to try again. If, in the No "There" There Kid's estimation, the question still has been entirely left unanswered, he or she rings a second bell, at which time the original questioner is allowed a redirect: i.e., "What I meant for you to answer, sir, was not why you and Vice President X were testifying before the commission, but why you felt the need to testify before the commission together." The politician is then given a third opportunity to respond. If, in the No "There" There Kid's estimation, this third attempt also leaves the question entirely unanswered, he or she sounds a buzzer, and a graphic above the politician's head is changed to read "Direct Questions Evaded: 1." And so on. JIM SHEPARD  wankerzone [wan'-kur-zohn] n. a place where hardcore liberals and conservatives go to hit each other with pillows. These zones, which are padded and full of fun obstacles, were constructed so that a person who feels very strongly about some issue may seek out a counterpart who disagrees just as strongly and then they can swat each other with heavy pillows. The zones became taxpayer-funded, because it turned out everyone benefited one way or another, either through the entertaining diversion of watching folks engage in spirited pillow fights or through the eventual reduction in overbearing attempts to legislate other people's behavior. After a good session in the wankerzone, the two dueling parties are encouraged to sit down together and have a nice cool smoothie. ARTHUR BRADFORD  Zzzunday [zuhn'-day] n. national holiday occurring once every 28 years, when a leap year coincides with a Sunday. Zzzunday is celebrated with 24 hours of uninterrupted sleep, in recognition of an entire generation's accumulated sleep deficit. Secondary holidays have grown to immediately precede Zzzunday, including Sleepless Friday, and a Hibernation Saturday of block parties, children's sleepovers, and retail promotional sales of bed linens, mattresses, and pillows. Traditionally, insomniacs mark Zzzunday by going out to a Chinese restaurantif they can find one open that day. PAUL COLLINS  - - - -

      ok so this email is making the rounds in danville......  Breaking News...    Washington DC, July 6, 2004 - Congress today announced that the Office of President of the United States will be outsourced to overseas as of September 30th, the end of the federal government's 2004 fiscal year. The move is being made to save $400K a year in salary and related overhead."The cost savings will be quite significant", said Congressman Adam Smith (R- Wash) who, with the aid of the congressional research arm, the General Accounting Office, has studied outsourcing of American jobs extensively.  "We simply can no longer afford this level of outlay and remain competitive on the world stage," Congressman Smith said. Exporting American jobs has been a popular trend lately. Mr. Bush was informed by e-mail this morning of the termination of his position.  He will receive health coverage, expenses and salary until his final day of employment.  After that, with a two week waiting period, he will then be eligible for $240 dollars a week from unemployment insurance for 13 weeks.  Unfortunately he will not be able to receive state Medicaid health insurance coverage as his unemployment benefits are over the required limit.   Preparations have been underway for some time for the job move.  Mr. Sanji Gurvinder Singh of Indus Teleservices, Mumbai, India, will be assuming the Office of President of the United States as of October 1. Mr. Singh was born in the United States while his parents were here on student visas, thus making him eligible for the position.  He will receive a salary of $320 US a month but with no health coverage or other benefits.  Due to the time difference between the US and India, Mr.Singh will be working primarily at night when offices of the US Government will be open. "I am excited to serve in this position," Mr. Singh stated in an exclusive interview. "Working nights will let me keep my day job at the American Express call center.  I always knew I could be President someday."   Congress recommended being patient to those planning to call Mr. Singh, as he may not be fully aware of all the issues involved with his new position.  A Congressional spokesperson noted that Mr. Singh has been given a 'script tree' to follow that will allow him to respond to most topics of concern.  The spokesperson further noted that "additional savings will be realized as these scripting tools have already been used previously by Mr. Bush here in the US.  Such scripts will enable Mr.Singh to  provide an answer without having to fully understand the issue itself." Congress continues to explore other outsourcing possibilities, including the Office of the Vice President and most Cabinet positions.

      ok, so the following sentiment is by my friend victoria....who used to be a nun.  (2000) ..... Victoria Scarborough 11 July 2004   During the past IN THE BEGINNING .,  several months, we've been fortunate to have heard some excellent, scholarly talks about what the earliest forms of Christianity may have been like. We've heard a lot about apocryphal gospels, with their differing views of Jesus and his message, and we've heard about the systematic suppression of any of those writings which did not reflect the party-line. Hopefully, this information has broadened our perspective and enriched our Christianity. While I am not a scholar, I hope today to contribute something to this discussion by examining another aspect of earliest Christianity that we somehow overlook, the fact that the earliest Christians were Jews. Jesus, or rather Joshua ben Joseph, lived and died a faithful Jew; his followers, men and women alike, were all faithful Jews. Scholars in the field of first century Christianity are united in the opinion that this Joshua ben Joseph did not intend to establish another religion but that his life and ministry were embedded solidly within Hebrew tradition, especially the Hebrew prophetic tradition. The Acts, both canonical and apocryphal, indicate that the earliest disciples continued worshiping at the Temple, continued in the daily sacrifices and prayer rituals associated with the Judaism of that time, that they remained faithful, practicing Jews. So, what happened? When did we cease being Jewish and commence being Christian? And why? What event or events intervened to sever the faithful Jew, Joshua ben Joseph, from the faith that shaped him? When and why did we decide to ignore, even to denigrate, the traditions that gave him his life, his passion, his power? Well, these are all good questions, questions to which there are many good, scholarly answers. But the question I would like to pose today is a more imaginative one: What might we be like today, as Christians, if we had remained Jewish? If we had not turned our back on our Jewishness, if we were to hear and experience this charismatic Joshua ben Joseph as Jews, what difference might it make to us who today identify ourselves, some emphatically and some tentatively, as Christians? In short, what have we missed? Like any imaginative question, this one can only engender imaginative answers, but I hope my particular imaginings this morning are based on some basic feel for some of the traditions of Judaism, gleaned from several years of reading, studying, and discussing. And, as you may have noticed, the question "What have we missed?" presupposes that we have indeed lost something, a proposition with which many Christians may be uncomfortable. Nevertheless, I believe we would be better people, better followers of Jesus/Joshua ben Joseph, if we were better Jews. And so, let us imagine . . . For one thing, I think we might be freer in our thinking about God and more willing to entertain the idea that other people might see God differently than we do.   A central tenet of the Jewish faith is that God reveals Godself to each person in a different way. You can't be taught who God is, you can only experience God for yourself. You can certainly learn about how God revealed Godself to others but their revelation is not yours. The primary responsibility of the Jew is to devote sufficient time, energy, and commitment to this process of uncovering his own particular revelation. He owes it to God to discover that divine spark within himself. The first commandment, "I am the Lord your God and you shall have no other Gods before me" has been interpreted to mean that you must find the Lord YOUR God and not give yourself to the worship of the gods of other people. This personal relationship with God, this unique and personal revelation given to each person, is then meant to be shared with the world. The Jew owes it to his family, his community, his world, to manifest the God he has discovered within himself. In this way, God is glorified and the richness of God's nature is at least partially revealed. When we see Jews poring over texts, studying the Law, or engaging in seemingly endless debate over what appear to be minor issues of faith or practice, we are seeing this process in action. We are seeing unique individuals looking inward for their divine spark then sharing that revelation with others who are engaging in the same process. Jews don't expect to agree with each other; they expect to manifest different aspects of God's immeasurable richness and complexity. If we look again at the gospel stories of Joshua ben Joseph debating on the steps of the Temple, we are not seeing Jesus under attack by the establishment of rule-bound Pharisees and Sadducees, we are seeing faithful Jews engaging in the manifestation of who they are and how they understand God. And the Pharisees are as faithful to this process as is Joshua ben Joseph. This is not to say that Jews do not believe in divine truth; it is to say that Jews recognize that the divine can never be completely grasped by any one person or any one group. It is to say that the divine revelation given to one person may appear to be diametrically opposed to the revelation given to another but that, given the enormous complexity of God, both may be true. In addition to being freer in our approach to God, I believe we might also experience more wholeness and integration in our personal lives. Jewish belief recognizes no dichotomy between the body and the soul. Men and women are created as "nefesh", a term which signifies a unified organic being. Jews have never shunned the body as unholy, nor have they ever suggested that the spirit is anything but incarnated within the flesh. The holiest day of the week, the Sabbath, is welcomed by lighting candles and singing songs that invoke the imagery of a Bride coming to her husband. It is celebrated with wine and good food, at home, with one's family and close friends. Jewish couples traditionally make love on the Sabbath as a further celebration of the gift of life and body.   As Christians we have learned to make an artificial distinction between that which is spirit and that which is flesh. We have learned to value the one and denigrate or deny the other. We have seen the one as holy and sacred, the other as evil and sinful. Isn't this dualism what lies behind the recent reactions, ranging from titillation to horror, to the possibility that Jesus may have loved a woman? We have wanted to sever the spirit of Jesus from the body of Joshua ben Joseph. We have even gone so far as to divide the world into a larger version of this same dichotomy, calling part of the world sacred and part of it profane. We have forgotten that the answer to the psalmist's question, "Where can I flee from Your Presence, O Lord?" is precisely "No where." Were we to experience ourselves more profoundly as "nefesh", we might experience more profoundly the God who permeates the things and people around us, the God who is intimately available to us through our body's senses, the all-pervading Presence who declares that there are no profane places. Finally, if we were better Jews, I suspect we might be more responsible, more compassionate people, or at least our faith would encourage us in that direction. There is no concept of original sin in Judaism. On the contrary, man is the darling of God, the apple of God's eye, imprinted with the very image of God. However, Judaism does recognize two impulses within human nature, the impulse for good and the impulse for evil. Both exist as potentialities, not as determinants, and both are God-given. Indeed, in what may seem very strange to us who have developed some very distinct neuroses about sin, Judaism goes so far as to say that it is impossible for a person to serve God without the evil impulse. It alone is the source of vitality, vibrancy, and action.   So the issue, then, becomes one of choice. Judaism is very clear that each person alone chooses what he will become, and what kind of a world he will create. And what he is choosing for or against is what Judaism calls "tikkun olam", the repair of the world. In Jewish belief, God invites us into co-creation, into the process of redemption which will bring forth the world of compassion, righteousness, and justice that God envisions but which man must implement in the here and newness of his individual life. Within Judaism is the belief that the Messiah will come, not to bring redemption and restoration to the world of men, but only when men have succeeded in redeeming and restoring the world for the Messiah. From the Jewish perspective, every action in which we engage changes the universe, for good or for ill.   If we really believed that it was our responsibility to bring forth the Kingdom of God, wouldn't that make a difference in how we exercised this freedom of choice? When Joshua ben Joseph said that the Kingdom was within us, do you suppose he meant we should leave it there? Or was he pointing out to us our ability and our respons-ability to embody God's vision however and whenever we can? As Christians, we have sometimes assumed that the world is irredeemable and that it will take the Second Coming to restore what sinful man has broken. As Jews, we might just roll up our sleeves, flex our muscles, and get busy. The earliest Christians identified themselves as Jews, a situation which persisted into the second and third centuries CE. They heard the message of Joshua ben Joseph against the background of their shared Jewish beliefs and practices. But for much of our history, we Christians have been cut off from our roots in the long, fertile centuries of Jewish faith; we have been denied access to some of the profound insights and rich traditions that empowered Joshua ben Joseph to live, to teach, to interact with people as he did. I think it's safe to say we have even taken some wrong turns, headed in directions that Jesus himself would not have supported, because we have forgotten who and what he was. "WWJD", "What would Jesus do?" has become a popular bumper-sticker-type question among some Christians today.   Perhaps we would come closer to finding an appropriate answer if the question we asked - imaginatively, of course - was "What would Joshua ben Joseph do?"     ..........

      ok, so i promised not to blog again until tom_baker logged on.....but...i have a bone to pick with robert mondavi.......i have enjoyed a wine from that conglomerate.....2001 fume blanc.....only to discover the following...today...on-line....  Sauvignon Blanc has been used for generations in France, and came to California in 1878. In the US it is sometimes called "Fum Blanc", a name first coined by Robert Mondavi. The sales of the wine under this new name now exceed sales under the correct name. Sauvignon Blanc has pronounced flavors of a herbal variety, plus olive and a soft, smoky flavor. They can be anything from sweet to dry, but are typically very light.    i knew that i liked this wine.....and i am ashamed that i could not tell that i was really drinking sauvignon blanc.......only in america do we play the public with made-up names for food and beverages............

      ok, so the political scene is heating up....at least as controlled by the spin doctors......this morning...on the same page of the paper were the following stories/news releases........ron reagan to address democrats at their convention about stem cell research.....he and his mother have been quite public about their disdain for bush's position on stem cell research, which the reagan's claim is bush's bowing to the conservative right of the party, rather than seeing the reasonable potential of this research.......bush may think differently when he gets alzheimer's....but then he won't be able to think about it for long.......the other story, about lynne cheney.......struck me as quite the planted story.....the republicans trotting out the 2nd lady......now that the democratic candidates wives have been making the rounds of talk shows, 60 minutes, etc.......the fact that the cheney's have a gay daughter is well-known...and we could all suppose that at least one of the cheney parents might 'have mixed feelings' about banning gay marriage.....the article never said anything further than mixed feelings.......so one could conclude that neither cheney will give public support to those who are in favor if legalizing gay marriages.......lynne cheney would not be on public record for any subject without the blessing of the rnc.....it is all funny........on the other hand......i was appauled to hear that at a campaign stop,  urlLink theresa  pulled the thumb out of the mouth of one of the edward's children........what was she thinking.....for starts, a child sucking a thumb is a quaint icon for all that is good and peaceful about american life........but a woman not the child's mother pulling that same thumb out comes off as rude, callous, and almost mean........mean as i am these days....i would never presume to take a child's thumb away...especially given the stress level that child has been thrown into of late....shame on theresa....

      ok,so today's first blog has been borrowed from mpr's writer's almanac....  It's the birthday of Henry David Thoreau, born David Henry Thoreau in Concord, Massachusetts (1817). He's the author of Walden; or, Life in the Woods (1854) and the essay "Civil Disobedience" (1849).   He became the first member of his family to go to college when he enrolled at Harvard in 1833 at age sixteen. He wasn't especially happy with the teaching methods used at Harvard. Ralph Waldo Emerson is said to have remarked that most of the branches of learning were taught at Harvard and Thoreau to have replied, "Yes, indeed, all the branches and none of the roots." He graduated in 1837, ninth in his class, and refused a diploma, thinking there were better ways to spend five dollars.   He changed his name to Henry David and became a teacher. When criticized by the supervisor of the local public school for not using corporal punishment on his students, Thoreau thrashed a random group of his pupils to illustrate the senselessness of it all and resigned from the school. When Emerson moved to Concord, Thoreau lived with him and did odd jobs around the house. Emerson encouraged Thoreau to write poetry, and suggested that Thoreau keep a journal, both of which Thoreau continued to do his entire life.   In 1845, when Thoreau was twenty-seven, he built a small cabin on the edge of Walden Pond, a small lake near Concord, and moved there. His motto was "Simplify, simplify, simplify." He said that his goal was "to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach." And he said, "I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up." Walden was published in 1854. Thoreau said, "Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life. Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be good for something.   i like this guy.......wonder how he handled all the weeds after several days of rain...........

      ok, so this rainy week has caused weeds to take over the beds i cleaned out so faithfully on july 5, my day off.......this turn of events hardly seems fair, yet it happens every summer.........the roses come and go...the perennials come and go......and the weeds take over by mid-july......by the time labor day rolls around......i have to fill in with mums to give the beds a bit of color at our annual pound and pedal ride/run/picnic........ah well.........i did pulled out what i could....after today's rain.........the rest will have to wait until another day.......

      ok, so i am amused by the variations on chin hair that one sees when watching major league baseball........some go full-frontal with lots and lots of facial hair.....full beard with mustache........others go for just the mustache.....maybe not the waxed out-to-the sides that i remember on oakland players years ago.......but respectable mustaches.....and then there is the chin hair.....some have a simple goatee.....pointed....while others sport a trimmed goatee that looks like a dot in the  cleft..other shave everything except what hangs down below....curious........and then there are the creative cuts.....with clipped hair encircling the chin...with a dot in the middle....seems a lot of bother...for myself..i am not attracted to facial hair of any kind...so the effects are wasted on this fan...........

      ok, so i taught sunday school this morning, out of rotation with my partner, cynthia........and i neglected to ask her where she was going........i found out just before church....and regretted that i had not asked ahead of time.....cynthia and her husband flew friday morning to nyc.....went to the yankees game friday night (sat in   the coca cola box, by the way......)then rented a car saturday morning....and drove to boston in time to see boston play texas last night.........how about that....i was not even aware that they were baseball fans......just goes to show me that we cannot ask enough questions of our friends...........it must have been a great game they saw in boston.....so many pitcher changes........and great home runs.......and they were so nice to let david ortiz have the night off to be with his wife and new child.........

      ok, so i am still agitated by michael moore's movie.......about how  urlLink bush and cronies  have  urlLink financial connections  to an  urlLink oil pipeline  being built in afghanistan......and to the  urlLink saudi royal family ......and therefore decisions made in response to 9-11 had as much or more to do with  urlLink protecting oil interests ...theirs and those of their  urlLink friends .......than anything else.....take  urlLink bush 's resistence at an independent investigation....the sitting president organized such investigations within days of pearl harbor....and of kennedy's assasination....and the oklahoma city bombing.......for bush to let the  urlLink bin laden family and the saudi royal family  leave the country after 9-11........without any questioning/statements.....would be like clinton letting timothy mcvey's family leave town free and clear.......turns out that companies to which  urlLink bush  and cheney have political and financial ties  urlLink actually entertained the taliban  the summer before 9-11.....remember that oil pipeline deal?......that is why bush did not want to go after bin laden in afghanistan........he did not want to jeopardize his interests there.....and so he made saddam hussein his target......he wanted to  urlLink bomb iraq  after 9-11, even though none of the guys who hijacked the planes were iraqi....they were all saudi....and he couldn't attack his friends he just allowed to leave the country...now could he......chilling.....absolutely chilling.....and then there is  urlLink ashcroft  and the  urlLink patriot act .....which  urlLink congress  passed without actually reading.....that basically allows for a  urlLink roll-back of basic freedoms  in the  urlLink interest of security .......i especially enjoyed the part in moore's movie when he drove around the  urlLink capital area  in an ice cream truck reading aloud the  urlLink patriot act .......the movie is somewhat critical fo the  urlLink democrats  who signed on for the war....and who voted for the  urlLink patriot act .......so in many ways this was not a  urlLink pro-democratic  film......as much as it is an  urlLink anti-bush  movie.......

      ok, so i like to read the poem on writer's almanac from mpr every morning.....here is today's installment.....i found it clever yet a sad reflection on our times.......  Poem: "what she was wearing," by Denver Butson, from illegible address.  Luquer Street Press.   what she was wearing  this is my suicide dress she told him I only wear it on days when I'm afraid I might kill myself if I don't wear it  you've been wearing it every day since we met he said  and these are my arson gloves  so you don't set fire to something? he asked  exactly  and this is my terrorism lipstick my assault and battery eyeliner my armed robbery boots  I'd like to undress you he said but would that make me an accomplice?   and today she said I'm wearing my infidelity underwear so don't get any ideas  and she put on her nervous breakdown hat and walked out the door

      ok, so there are many ends that are tying themselves up these days.....kind of like dragnet........when joe friday had all the loose ends accounted for before the 30 minute time slot was over.......well, yesterday...the cake stand appeared.........or rather...was sheepishly delivered...by the father-of-the-bride.......1 year late.........this incident was blogged in great detail at the time....but for newer followers...i will summarize.......the couple from who we bought the restaurant......who were going to retire in florida...went for a short season....and then basically came back home semi-disappointed...they then started making wedding cakes.....special order...out of their illegal at-home kitchen.......the only wedding that we had at the restaurant...that featured one of their cakes......was the most memorable wedding because of the cake.......delivered...set up....several layers separated by white plastic columns........so far...so good....except that the columns were not adequately supported by matching internal supports.....and so.....by the time the bride arrived after the ceremony....the cake was literally leaning like the tower of pisa......to the point that we felt we needed someone to stand in back of it, wearing gloves, of course....to catch it when it fell.......bigtime lean.......hard to not notice it lean.......we had the bride cut it early....just to be safe.......and that was the easy part.......there was more cake than could be eaten at the reception......so the bride's family took the rest home.....and returned all of the white plastic columns, supports, etc....or so we thought......months later....the cake-baker aka our landlord.......sent her husband by to pick up the cake stand.....what cake stand?........he insisted on looking around....and so...since last year...he has 'looked around' for that cake stand every month...when he comes to get the rent check.......and has not found it.......there were many harsh words about the cake...the bride....a lawyer...refused to pay for it.....fine and dandy when you live out of town.....but her parents till live here....and are not on speaking terms with the cake-baker........and so...when the bride's parents actually found the cake stand in their basement.....they dropped it by trc, rather than taking it directly to the cake baker.........so now we haver to figure out how to graciously deliver it hence....i say...we leave it on their porch, then ring the bell and run away...........but knowing our luck...these people will be armed.........so we are back to plan b...whatever that is.........

      ok, so the new yorker had a piece about  urlLink childe hassam and the retrospective of his art at the met in nyc.......much as i do not like the yankees.......i do like the art that one can see in their hometown......my friend betty p. went to see this retrospective as a 50th birthday present from her spouse..........how thoughtful.........i like childe hassam for the colors he chooses.......the picture featured in the new yorker......a view of gloucester harbor....has identical hues to a van gogh poster that is framed by my front door......of a blooming tree in a fenced yard.......we bought it on our honeymoon...at the van gogh museum in amsterdam.......having toured the heineken brewery first.....including the 3, i repeat 3 free mugs of beer.......we then stumbled over to watch vincent go mad, at least by testimony of his paintings.......which are arranged in chronological order......the good news it that i picked out a lovely poster despite my level of drunkenness..........which brings me to the childe hassam piece......i think it would be lovely in my imaginary paris apartment....the one that i will buy when gail and i win the lottery.....a nice bit of irony.....an american impressionist in paris.....with my departure looming, gail and i have decided that we really need to win soon.....but again, back to childe......i appreciate the comparisons made between him and monet......and having seen so many more monets......or at least monets so many more times.....i may just appreciate hassam for his enthusiasm......one expects it of a french painter.....but not necessarily of an american one........the gloucester harbor just reeks of enthusiasm......and optimism......it is a happy, contented picture......and certainly underappreciated...........one of my favorite movies...the thomas crown affair......(yes, i do watch it to hear the name mr.crown spoken so often........, and i do actually have a cousin called thomas crown......he buys hops for anheiser-busch in st. louis).....focuses on the theft of a painting by monet........and much if made of this painting........which looks very much like impression: sunset....now back at le marmatton........thomas crown comes frequently to the museum to look at a painting of haystacks......which is also by monet.....though the painter is never named...and the security guard frequently alludes to the impression:sunset painting like it is the only monet in the room........an inside joke for monet lovers.....don't get me wrong...i am a monet groupie just like everybody else...i have traveled to giverny no fewer than 4 times......the first time.....i got on an express train to rouen by mistake.....and the train did not stop at giverny.....and i had to wander the streets over the lunch break until the next train back....i had a lovely lunch looking at the cathedral in rouen...the one monet painted in a series of impressions...at many times of day....to the point that it looks eerily different in each one......i have visited impression:sunset......before, during, and after it's theft from le marmatton........i have visited l'orangerie whenever it happens to be open...to see the breathtaking wall-size waterlily ponds.......in january the entire building was gutted to the point that one could see through it......no idea if the waterlilies are there, in the basement....or elsewhere......i saw a lovely retrospective of monet's series painting in bosotn at the fine arts museum......a long while back it seems........maybe i need to make childe hassam pilgrimages from now on.....would not that be the patriotic thing to do.....now, just where is gloucester?................

      ok,so i spent the day at work, when i was supposed to be actually working.......doing networking about the job i want in lexington........i found out that 1) when my partner and key staff like gail did the taste of the bluegrass, a fundraising event in which we offered tastes of our tomato celery soup and 3 layered cheese torte......they met the director of the lexington health department.........2)the nurse diabetes specialist in frankfort that oversees the program in lexington is someone not only that i worked with years ago at the hospital in danville...she was also coerced to quit but the same person who did the same to me....small world........and she has already called to put in a good word.....3) the director of our local health department (my neighbor for 22 years)......told me that the new director in lexington was coerced to quit a similar job in louisvlle several years ago....she then went to georgia....and has now returned......i have really stewed over explaining why i left the hospital.....seems i will find an understanding audience.........now ....all i need is an interview date.............

      ok, so yesterday's team time trial was a spectacular event.....in the rain...through twisted roadways, cobbled streets..........quite dramatic........us postal delivered a remarkable performance.......riding in such an orchestrated aerodynamic formation that one would suspect that they trained in a wind tunnel......it was a sight to see.......team phonak, with tyler hamilton, also had an impressive ride.....finishing with only 5 men...the minimum required to record a team time......their team was behind the clock at each of the checkpoints but managed to rally and pull off a top 5 team ride anyway......quite gutsy for a team to do this, as the more men ride in formation, the less time any of them has to ride up front.......the front guy takes the brunt of the wind....the guys in back get to rest depsite the fact that they are turning rpm's......9 guys are on a team...postal had already lost one guy...and finished with 7...the straggler came in 4 minutes behind....the team time trial win gives us postal a time boost....... from  urlLink s.i.com ..........Armstrong and five teammates are among the top seven riders in the overall standings -- a clear sign of strength. George Hincapie is No. 2, 10 seconds behind. He is followed by No. 3 Floyd Landis, No. 4. Jose Azevedo, No. 5. Jose Luis Rubiera and No. 7 Viatceslav Ekimov..........of the 'posties', hincappie and ekimov are the pace setters...the guys who take turns riding out front in groups of mixed team riders......the other team members then ride around lance to protect him from mayhem.....several of the postal service guys are mountain specialists....and they will pace lance on mountain stages.....so much strategy goes into a win for lance.......but as yesterday proves.....when strategy and training come together, it is a beaultiful sight to see.........

      ok,so today i found something that i had been looking for...searching for....obsessing over.......a thing that i had replaced......inadequately...but replaced......it is a cookie cutter....stainless steel...not quite 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.....a scalloped half-moon..perfect for these little lime shortbread cookies that i haven't made since i lost the cookie cutter...it had sentimental value...because i bought it years ago at dehillerin....near les halles..the ultimate kitchen supply store.....i was there in january...and tried to find the exact cutter......the clerk denied having any knowledge that they had ever sold such a cutter, despite my lovely drawing...they did sell to me an oval cutter, without scallops...that is lovely but just not the same as the one i lost.........well....today i found it, at the restaurant...in an unlikely place......had it been a likely place i would have found it years ago.........and i was elated......gentle readers.......joy is an emotion that seems harder and harder to come by as i get older.......today i am convinced that i felt genuine joy......i have been trying to take home, box by box, things that i had brought from home when we opened the restaurant....aside from things i know to have been broken.....i have located just about everything...except that blessed cookie cutter.......it must be a sign from God that it is time to leave......it is sad, of course....like getting a divorce......maybe worse.....because it is like living in the same house when your spouse takes a new wife....and you are both kind of there together but nothing is official, legal, or severed.........but, hey.....i got the cookie cutter...and that is really all that matters..........

      ok, so the guys who cover the tour on oln finally got their interview with sheryl crow after yesterday's stage.......speculation has been ripe about how her presense in lance's life....and on the tour will affect the outcome.......the tabloids as well as sports illustrated and outside magazine have had a field day......let's give her some credit....for starts...she has undertaken to learn the art of cycling herself.....the story goes....from our trek dealer, by the way.....that sheryl and lance walked into an l.a. bike shop....and he saw the exact bike he had in mind for her...a smaller version of his own trek racing bike...weighs 2 pounds.....and costs $4500....and the dealer was msart enough to let them just walk out with it.....and arrnage to call trek for compsation later....lance is trek's posterboy...and he does not have to pay for a bike for his girlfriend........and so...sheryl begins to train.....and gets good enough that she does the first 25 miles of lances's training rides with him...then switches over to the pursuit car.......she even rode up alp d'uez....the mean uphill stage that tends to separate the winners from the losers in each year's tour......she rode up that mountain in 90 minutes......albeit lance can do it in 20...but my point is that she is no groupie hanger-on, but a partner prepared to be completely supportive......i am impressed.....of course...i am still saddened by the breakup of his family........but she had nothing to do with that......so if it makes her happy...it can't be that bad.......

      ok, so the princess diana memorial has been dedicated in hyde park.......and i think it is marvelous...a reason to go to london, by the way........it is a water feature that begins in a waterfall and ends in a reflecting pool.......with a shallow oval-shaped stone water-channel in the middle.....a place for children to play on hot days...... this design has many critics......those who feel it is too casual....but then diana was a pretty casual person....in between bursts of glamour.......she would have approved the interactive nature of this memorial......a playground rather than a shrine........this was the kind of thing someone in my neck of the woods had to read-online.......the tiny article in the lexington paper was buried in the back of the first section, with no photo......of either the queen, or prince charles et al, or the memorial........the queen looked lovely in purple by the way......she did say kind things about diana's memory.......let's hope she meant them......

      ok, so this poem, sadly, speaks to me......  Poem: "Afraid So" by Jeanne Marie Beaumont from Curious Conduct  BOA Editions, Ltd., 2004.  Afraid So  Is it starting to rain? Did the check bounce? Are we out of coffee? Is this going to hurt? Could you lose your job? Did the glass break? Was the baggage misrouted? Will this go on my record? Are you missing much money? Was anyone injured? Is the traffic heavy? Do I have to remove my clothes? Will it leave a scar? Must you go? Will this be in the papers? Is my time up already? Are we seeing the understudy? Will it affect my eyesight? Did all the books burn? Are you still smoking? Is the bone broken? Will I have to put him to sleep? Was the car totaled? Am I responsible for these charges? Are you contagious? Will we have to wait long? Is the runway icy? Was the gun loaded? Could this cause side effects? Do you know who betrayed you? Is the wound infected? Are we lost? Can it get any worse?  frankly, of the woes listed, being out of coffee is right up there in terms of personal distasters.........i might have ended with that

      ok, so the ny thruway is not a place for regrets.....about the music you wish you had thought to bring along..................i DID have some of my favorites.......tapestry by carole king.....sweet baby james by james taylor.......elvis costello's hits.........the inigo girls.......dwight yocum...........some old tom petty.......bonnie raitt.....beatles......radiohead  (they are growing on me.....)...........joni mitchell.....old david bowie.....neil young's harvest album................all good for singing along (silently............as we wouldn't want to wake the sleeping...........)....but there are those albums that i neglected to bring....either because they belong to children who did not know to bring them....or because said children who own them no longer live at home..............here is my short list of music that would have made the journey more enjoyable.................beck's odelay album.......with devil's haircut...............there is just something about that album/song that complements road trips............u-2's joshua tree album........led zeppelin IV.............especially ramble on...........csn&amp;y........especially the 4-way street album with cowgirl in the sand.......the clash............i especially like london calling.............and classic joe walsh......for driving in the cleveland area................there is always the next time...................

      ok, so in my absense, the redsox have traded nomar.....lost a bunch of games, and really raised a ruckus........because supposedly nomar did not really want to leave boston..............this article in  urlLink usa today  basically blames boston for their own misfortunes, not just with the selling of babe ruth, but also with the mishandling of carlton fisk, wade boggs, roger clemmons, and some guy named mo..................so we really should not be surprised that they traded nomar........or so the commentator writes................looking at the wildcard race, boston had better belly up tot he plate with some serious baseball, or their season will end sooner than expected............

      ok, so we made it home in record time.......possibly because we broke all land speed limits in 4 states..................and the phone was flashing messages...and the cat was hungry.......and the mail and papers piled on the front table......and i have consumed so much caffeine in the past 15 hours of driving/riding that i may never get to sleep...............the new york thruway is sooooooooooo long.......just getting past buffalo seemed a major accomplishment.........and then past the corner of pennsulvania....and into ohio, and from there on in the drive was no-big-deal.......as nearly every exit holds some sort of memory.......relatives, past homes/apartments, i can tell you the exit we took to get to my senior prom, the exits i could take to get to apartments/dorms in both college and grad school..............even the exit where my friend cynthia's boyfriend locked his keys in his trunk as we were driving up to her parent's summer home in the fingerlakes..........this is also the exit to my mother's sister's house.....and i can recall the temptation to call her for help...........but i did not as i was traveling with a boy i did not want to explain.....ah well.....such are memories, but to keep us awake on long trips................an entire state of memories it would seem..............all past now that i have lived in kentucky longer than i have lived anywhere.................so here i sit checking email...past midnight............only to find that some mail gets returned from that void that is cyberspace.....as undeliverable.............quite ironic...for words supposedly transferred at so many blips per minute..........i could have driven the message there myself, considering how far i have traveled in this day alone...........ah well...............i am hoping that god himself does not know i am home yet, as i plan to sleep in on sunday morning..................

      ok, so last night, after we stopped at a farm stand for sweet corn......our nephews brought over their families for a little farewell dinner...........ecw's sister has two sons, both a shade over 30 at this point.......with a total of 6 children under the age of 7...and another on the way..........for our little group.......myself at nearly 50, my spouse, a nearly grown son of 17 and a pre-teen of 11....we were taken by surprise at the level of chaos that ensues with so many little ones.........and the attention that must be paid by their parents..........3 in high chairs, plus another three at the little people's table.......and everybody wanting up for some reason or another...........how soon i have forgotten all of that..........the cutting up food so it can be eaten with hands, or a tiny fork.......the sippy cups......the food on the floor............on the other hand....my inlaws looked so absolutly delighted with their grandchildren...so that was special to see..............one of my children announced that he may just have dogs and no children just to spite me.........when i mentioned that i was also looking forward to little ones around some day........makes sense that the meanmamma would bring up a meanoffspring............so i should not be surprised................

      ok, so saratoga springs racecourse is no keeneland......the racetrack nearest us in the bluegrass state...........granted, keeneland only runs in april (spring meet) and october (fall meet)...so people tend to be a bit more grateful for the opportunity to be there at all..........and tend to dress up accordingly.....there are limited places to 'be' at keeneland.....the paddock, the rail, the clubhouse (exclusive...) and the grandstands ...the atmosphere is subdued, and refined.........but at saratoga.......where grandstand and clubhouse seating appears to be limited...there is a veritable circus.....with acres of picnic tables on the grounds, with tv's visible under canopies..........and lots of places for people to set up lawn chairs......and bringing a picnic and a cooler and byob is perfectly ok....but if you prefer there are numerous stands for sausage sandwiches, french fries, beer.......and everybody is dressed at the ends of the spectrum......come-as-you are...or raceday finery...with high heels and hats.........we had a good time despite the fct that it rained off and on...and we cashed no tickets........ah well......this was somehow good for ky's horsebreeding economy..........

      ok, so i bought a refrigerator magnet yesterday.....that in itself is not the big news......just the sentiment on it.........a 40's style photo of a woman with the caption...'she had not yet decided whether to use her power for good or evil....'so appropriate, i'd say, for mm............i think that it is a quotation from the fountainhead.....but i could not find proof last night on google........which doesn't mean much...as other quotes i have read were not there either......for example.......one year the  centre women's cross country team shirts had on the back......'and she did not consider pain a good enough reason to stop....'therefore i will have to reread the book to find that quotation.........either way....i thought it worth $4.50.................

      ok, so we have seen enough...........or at least, if scw wants to visit more schools he will have to find an alternative family to take him there...............the three of us most interested in visiting williams got into the car and drove the 22 miles across the ny/mass border...just in time for the 11:15 am tour....the tour guide, a russian/something political double major from chicago........entertained us thoroughly with williams lore and enticing differences between williams and other schools.....the entry system of dorms....the tutorial classes available in the oxford style......you gotta love a tour guide who tells you up front that she was active in the pro-choice consortium during the past school year..........anyway...the campus is marvelous...the berkshire/taconic mouintains are breathtaking.....we were impressed.......if they would admit aging feminists i would apply..............we then visited the clark institute, where we saw an exhibit of french paintings collected by some guy named bruyas.....who commisioned fellows like courbet, delacroix, etc to paint his portait......he had no fewer than 8 portraits of himself, either alone or with others.....like baudelaire.........i vow, right now...that when i win the lottery, i will commission artists to paint my portrait in at least 8 settings........like doing laundry, doing dishes.......all of thoese things that i avoid doing....just for the irony/absurdity of it all........surely this guy bruyas wasn't really in all of those situations portrayed on canvas as he paid others to paint for posterity................ah well.........we then dined on fine thai......not my spouse's favorite cuisine.....stephan and i enjoyed curry dishes, which we made over greatly, knowing that ernst despises curry...............this, on williamstown's 2 block downtown........and then on to north adams.....to mass moca...the museum of comtemporary art that is housed in a converted mill.........we saw at least 2 variations of exhibits we have seen elsewhere......the one we saw in bilbao......the one with the iron worm-like things on the floor around some larger iron-masses...with a wheeled thing...........the l.o. will recall this one....................the other was by an ohioan, just my age, named anne hamilton...who does these installations that involve a large room, with paper-dropping machines.....voices from speakers.........and masses of crumpled papers on the floor................the hirschorn in washington dc has a smaller less-elaborate version.....we saw that with belgian boy last summer...............he did not get it, but that is another story................we enjoyed watching scw enjoy this installation.................and then, there was the requisite stop at the local bike shop.........gentle readers......we stop at most bike shops........i particularly enjoyed one in downtown london on a previous vacation............but i opted to sit this one out..........we have vowed to honor our son with a cloak of secrecy with regards to his choice for early admission, and the choices for open season/back-up applications......so don't go asking me...............ok?  tomorrow, weather permitting, we are going to saratoga springs to watch the ponies......and maybe start on paying for this high-end college education through sheer dumb luck...............it will take luck for us to win at playing the ponies...........

      ok, so yesterday we drove up the 'northway' and then cross country several hours to blue mountain lake, a lovely place in the adirondacs where we have taken our boys several times before.....the adirondacs museum located there has gone through some wonderful updates since the last visit (?10 + years ago....)..........i especially enjoyed seeing the beautiful wooden canoe with the sail decked out as a back-country camping rig.........and the ladies 'outdoors' dress circa 1876 made of brown taffeta trimmed in brown serge......long sleeved, buttoned up to the chin, and reaching to the boot-tops........somehow my current ideas about outdoor gear for women doesn't include brown taffeta.............i did marvel at the workmanship (workwomanship....)....including the perfectly made-by-hand buttonholes........after we dragged cayle from the giftshop we drove 1/2 mile UP the road to the blue mountain lake trailhead...........for our planned family hike...........gentle readers........we have done this hike carrying andrew in a snuggly.....and with our boys in varying stages of toddler/youngster/preadolescence...................and they have always done well........but i swear to you that this trail has to have become eroded.....and therefore much more rocky........because despite my memories to the contrary.......the trail was not only straight up (well, you know this is an exageration.......but you can feel my pain...right?) but also strewn liberally with rocks from baby-bear size past papa-bear and on up to grizzly king of the forest........every step we took required judgement about where to put the next one to avoid stumbling and breaking out ones teeth............all this for 2.25 miles up and 2.25 miles back.............granted......the day was lovely, the scenery was idyllic,.....and the aroma.........a mixture of earthiness, hemlock and spruce reminded me of christmas.......only with a warmth to it.............something that i have never smelled in say...a yankee workshop candle which appear to be sold at every other 'outlet' in this area...........we were the last up and the last down.......in the semi-twilight.....we were afforded a sighting of a deer and fawn on the way down...for a brief moment until they turned their white tails to us and bolted.....our children seemed to scamper up.......and i am sure that my spouse would have done so as well.....but i took my time.....which is to say that i made many momentary stops..........and listened to many comments about how this would have been easier if i was several pounds lighter and in better shape...............had i the strength for the appropriate hand-gesture.........but no- i kept that retort for another day............3 hours from bottom to top and back.........and of course...it goes without saying that this morning i can barely walk.............and yet must rally in time to leave for our planned tour of williams college....and lunch in north adams and possibly the art museums there............and maybe a sidetrip on the way home to the pottery outlet in bennington, vt.............some reflections on our tour of amherst are in order at this point.....now that i have had time to remember that i failed to mention them before......first......there were a mother/daughter pair on our tour.......tall,thin, and tanned.......who at some point during the hour.....changed shoes with each other.................i tried to point this out to stephan for his amusement...but he does not notice shoes, it seems.........gentle readers.......i cannot even begin to imagine the ruckus that would insue if i asked my daughter who wears my size shoes...to change with me............so the fact that these women switched off so silently...........hmmm...............i am both amused and amazed.........i also had a real lightbulb moment on the amherst tour.........i noticed that an unusual number of people, both students and parents..were wearing boston redsox gear......a number 7  trot nixon  jersey.....hats, etc.............and i remember marveling at this until it occurred to me that we were within 100 miles of boston......and though we were also within driving distance of nyc............well, these would be naturally boston fans...........we also got a good laugh as we left williamstown (we drove through on the way home but did not stop because we were late for supper....) there was a sign posted at an intersection......'blind man in area'.....and as we looked up...there was the blindman.......with his white cane......heading right for his sign....right on cue................it seemed funnier at the time than it does right now.......

      ok, so after lounging about in our jammies drinking coffee and sitting serenely by the water.........scw and i decided to make haste to amherst and try to catch the last tour...........the campus was like many others....lots of brick.....and seemed to lack focus......we did like its relationship with the 4 other schools in the neighborhood.....smith, mt holyoke, hampshire and umass.......and the open curriculum.......we were more impressed by what we saw in north adams/williamstown on the way back.......such a marvelous area.....we will be back to tour williams before the week is out.............

      ok, so after a side trip to niagra falls (the gatlinburg of the east, by the way....) and a particularly unpleasant trek across the whole of new york state...the new york turnpike is a miserable place to drive, but the most direct route.............lots of construction...and delays.........we finally made it to ecw's sister's farm.......which is hard enough to locate in daylight hours.....let alone in pitch black conditions..............i was driving at the time....and basically had a chorus of backseat drivers giving directional tips as we counted side roads, and scanned mailboxes until we found the correct hidden drive............this morning has been glorious thus far.............our nephew, a landscape designer, installed an extensive water feature in their side yard....which takes up their entire side yard............it has 5 pools, in descending fashion, with several waterfalls....ending in a pond that is large enough for those huge koi...the kind that are almost 2 feet long.............there are bluestone and brick walkways.......incredible plantings....a bridge to the gazebo.......truckoads of granite boulders lining the pools/ponds..............it is something one would see in an arboritum............just the place to bring one's coffee....to just sit and take it all in.............it was both gift to his mother....and investment.....as his business is just down the road, and he sends potential clients by to witness it's grandeur.................and sign up to have one just like it installed..................omg.......over the top.......................we are trying to organize our time here.............middlebury and dartmouth are out, but we have added amherst to the williams visit.......which will probably happen with just scw and myself.................as the rest of my family has no interest in driving much more..............we will also have a day at the races in saratoga........and a day at blue mountain in the adirondacs........and maybe an evening at the outdoor theatre in albany...............i could just sit out by the ponds................

      ok, so we arrived in cleveland at 9:00 pm, at my aunt's home...surprised that they waited supper..............we sat down to all of my favorites....lima beans, mashed potatoes, sliced homegrown tomatoes, and baked chicken.............and a cold beer..............the drive was absolutely flat after we left kentucky.........the route following the glacier line............so sad when we passed my old hometown's exit north of columbus......nobody i am related to lives there anymore................we were reminded immediately of all that my mother's sister has in common with my own madre...............there is much conversation, and very little need for any words on our part...............my aunt can talk without drawing breath on a variety of topics.................and that is ok, because my aunt and uncle were completely informed (and up-to-date....) on my every move of the past..............day,week,month......because my mom and my aunt talk frequently..............today we set off for upstate ny.....within spitting distance of the vermont/mass corner...........with niagra falls on the way.................for the record.....we may visit a few schools while in the vicinity...williams........maybe darmouth, middlebury (again) and potentially cornell on the way home...................so no decision has been made....and that is ok.........

      ok, so i was highly amused yesterday, watching the reds play the astros...that the commentators were keeping half-an-eye on the clock...........because at 4:00 est (edt?) trading between ballclubs was over for any player wanting to be elligible for postseason play................would the big unit stay put, or go to nyy?....................that was the big question..................this morning there was a little chart in the paper outlining trades that happened and an entire article discussing trades that did not happen, and why they did not happen, and what all that means for the substance of the game..............for the record, randy johnson stays in arizona, for now............but nomar g. from the redsox goes to the cubs............no word on whether any of the lousy redsox pitchers went elsewhere....and this urlLink  funny aside .......a player who is going tot he redsox....from minnesota....played his last game with the twins friday........then changed uniforms and played aginst the twins saturday as a redsox...................watching baseball yesterday, and thinking about trading brought to mind the possibility for trading family members...............but wait......fox has already thought of that with their reality show....trading mommy....or some similarly silly name................ha!..........i may be mean, but it is for the private enjoyment/torment of this family, and this family only..............if i was traded out, even for a fantasy weekend, i could behave for the alloted time, baking cookies in high heels and a frilly apron......and tidy up a strangers house with a seriously sappy look on my face................the previews for ther fox show basically show the traded mommy raising all kinds of hell.................gentle readers...........yelling gets us nowhere...............whether it is fans screaming at the ump or their pitcher at a baseball game, the manager at his players, the owner berating the manager................i don't scream at home, so why scream elsewhere...................of course, if traded, my family may just come up with a screamer..................ha....that would give a whole new meaning to mean mamma..................
