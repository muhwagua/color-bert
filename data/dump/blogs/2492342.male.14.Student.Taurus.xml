      Wow....I've been gone like 4 days. I was in Mexico on mission trip thing, tho i just sorta hung out with juan, josue, omyra(lol) and some other people. On the way back i wrote 6 pages in a notebook in spanish about it. It's in spanish cause it was easier for me to write it like that when i started in Ensenada. It still is, but y'all wouldn't understand it. I'm trying to translate it all right, but bear with me if some words are jubbed up.  Omyra isn't coming. Nor Juan! I'm going to kill him! Jeez, I can even see his house now. And hers too(Omyra)! II don't even have a photo...I can't find my camera either. Monica is crazy. She's cute(not really the right word, but dont know how else to translate it) cause she wants to die. She doesn't like life and she wants to live three metres under the ground when she gets older. She has a really pretty house though.  I hope that I'll be able to go in March. I wanna see Omyra again and Juan. Heh, he's second. I can't move. The two blondes are making so much noise. Something about hand puppets.  I dont want to go. I wanna stay til the 4th, the day before school starts.  CRAP. School's gonna start in a few days. I HAVE TO MOVE NOW!! and I have two hours to the border. God help me. And still they(the blondes) don't know what I'm writing. It's ugly. (I think i meant the writing cause in the car its scribbled)  Unlike Omyra! Hehe... how many emails do I have already? 50? hehe  I hope(rough translation) that Omyra will call me. But what am I gonna say to her? (i gave my # to Josue and joked with him to give it to Omyra. then we decided he was going to, but not say it was my request lol) Ai  --Two hearts with a name in each, with or in the middle and question marks on the sides--  Ai, I don't know. I can't have more than like for her cause she has boyfriend. Well Juan said that she didn't. (Plus, she said somos novios) But that's what he said before too!!!! Ai....  Hah. Jake just said that there are pretty houses out the window. "Donde estamos?" What a fool. Americans dont know anything about mexico except that they can buy fireworks here. I WANT TO STAY HERE, without these stupid yanquis. Where can i throw away my diet Coke? My nose is being attacked by these people. No one except my dad showered.  Oi, I remember the lady in San DIego in the beginning. (Im gonna write the whole story out. we went to this gas station minimarket after we got mexican insurance and she asks my dad in an accent if theyre together(the sodas) and he falters before saying 'yes, juntos.' so she says in spanish, which is the rest of the convo too, 'didnt know u spoke spanish sorry. is it your son?' dad-  'yeah' oh, you married an american?" lol!!!! i mean, i thought it was hilarous. YOU MARRIED OUTSIDE LA RAZA PURA??!!! God forbid. now think if she knew he was iranian. lol)  I'm so thankful I could go. It's so beautiful here,(we're driving on the coast) the beach and the mountains. I want to return already. I DONT WANT TO GO. I want to stay! I want to wait for Omyra, and Juan, and everyone. I want to be here when it starts to rain.  Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams, Let it wash away, my fanstasies, Cause i wanna see  I don't remember all of it (its a song). I wanna sleep for 12 hours! hehe, more than Monica (she said she slept for no hours last night and likes waking up early). They're talking about massages(the blondes). God help me, I'm gonna die!!! (im really sqooshed)  I had a dream about Omyra yesterday. (im gonna write it again, cause its unclear how i wrote it. I was wlakign down this street, a dirt raod like the ones where i was in Ensenada, and I saw this american flag, except the flag was upside down. There was soemthing about this that happened later, but i dont remember anymore. ANyways, there was this dance where the couples dressed up together and i was going with omyra, but i had nothing to wear. SO i went shopping and got this shirt that said Merry Chrstmas on it. it was red and gray, and i liekd it. Then i saw her face.) SO HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oi!!!!!!  I hope my cards got to Zelenia and Aisha.  We're in Tijuana already. Im already tired....How will I go to LA? Oh. It wasnt Tijuana. It was Roasarito, a big city by there.  Jeez!!! Already 4 pages!  Im gonna go shower tho right now. Then ill finish this.

      I really haven't wanted to write. Oh well. I will.  Yesterday I went to pier 1 imports and bought this cool chinese vase, some fake flowers, a chinese rug(really small and silk) and some incense. It was nice, I set it all up. I wanna use the incense now though. I want to smell it. I made joeks to AIsha about praying to the elphant god all night though. lol  We were on the phone til 4, a little later than last itme. And this time, she was the one who was REALLY tired, not me. Yay.  But the last like..hour and a half i sang to her, every love song i could remember. And some I couldnt. I made up this long one from the song 'aisha' by outlandish, cause i only remembered the first line. thats good  Umm..I decided it was time to get back at someone. I mena, not in a mean way, but I was talking to someone and they told me I should get back at this guy. So that I shall.  Aisha's been on the road all day, driving South to hibernate for Christmas wiht family and laptop. Good for her. I'll be here.  My aunt's baby has jaundice. And I fought out she DID have a husband, but somethign I can't say happened to him.  That's good.   I found out I have ONE more reader than I thought. So that makes 2ish. lol.  Aw, someone just said I was kind. That's sweet. I feel good. Well tonight when Leila gets off from the hospital we'll go out to bella luna i think. I love the bread there.  I'm thinking more about brazilian songs ive heard, and understand more of them. yay me. Nos manos para ou. I get what that means. And i don't know why I bother to sya it.  I should do homeowkr. But biology and english dont sound AT ALL appealing. ANd i don't wanna go to mexico, i wanna stay wtih aisha. But I'll see Juan there. We're not going to exactly the same palce, so I won't see Zelenia though. It's sad. I'm sending her a letter expalining why.   My creative energy ran out. lol Oh, I ahvent seen bertha in hours. she mightve left without her presents. *cries* Oh well...  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Except those heathens like me!! We can celebrate Mithras' birthday instead!! yay!!  Much love  Peace  ~alexmeister

      Today...I woke up at 11:30, cause i was on the phone til 3 40 with aisha. There was a big earthquake 15 mins before i got up, like 6.5. It killed 2 people.  I dont feel like writing long, intricate sentences today. Oh well. So i sat around...took shower...online..I went out at like 4 30, to calvary to fill out forms for the mexico trip, to savons, and then a haircut. Afterwards, i went to old navy. yay. i got a ball, since the other one died, and some shirts and stuff.  I dint go to my grandmas with michael for the night cause my aunt tiffany's having a baby.  Let's explain this story. She was like a troubled kid, cause she was born like during my grandmas divorce..and she had to go to finishing school and got kicked out, then went to college in redwood and i dont really know what happened. I hadnt seen her in years until like 2 weeks ago. And then we barely talked.She's like 28 er something, and it's brave she's having a baby without a boyfriend. She lives with my grandma and with my grandpa depending on the time. He lives across town, but i havent heard from him in years. Sad, yes.  Something else happened. I cant remember right now though. Maybe later ill tell you. I ahve to eat so i can take the big pill.   oh yeah, brighton imed last night while iw as watchign Titanic, and, my luck, i had the Aisha song away message. grrrreat. Hopefully shes on tonight again. I want to talk to her.  Much love  peace  ~alex

      Oh yeah, aria called me today right before i went out. she had a cold, so i thought she asked for leila, but she had reza. See, english teacher says it 'raiza', so now everyone calls me that isntead of reh-za. so i give it to leila, and leilas like 'hey! whats wrong?' cause she often talks to people a while before she knows who it is, and shes like 'i still have a cold. you know, you sound like a girl on the phone.' and leilas like 'are you on medication???!' and arias like 'is this alex?' lol. it was really funny.  so we talked about homework and how shes holding up afer break up, and her mr wonderufl doll. so i got one of those mr wonderfu dolls at the mall for leila, in her everpresent search for a guy. lol. hey, all girls school life is tough.  right. see you later  aisha is sexy  much love  peace  ~alex

      I went to the mall with daddio today. We argued a lot, and it was funny, most was about things you wouldnt expect. How my dad exploited the gardeners, who were wage slaves to the American diehard capitlaist system. lol. and he realized for the first time i was communist. but then we were at the mall and the convo died.  Yeah, ok, so we went to the mall in woodland hills, and I was happy cause i looked like crap, my hairs too long, and im tired. Well, i was happy, cause we werent going to the mall in thousand oaks, where most people i know shop. but whatever, i see kimberly, who i ahvent seen since last year, and shes a cheerleader and shes looking fine. and im total crap. Grrreat. Then I go out and see the hottest girl ever go up the elevator. Shes like my age, and i see her walking..then she turns around up the elevator and i saw her face...*SIZZLE*..and she looked at me. but i was too ugly for her or something. wait. no. the elevator ended and she wa son the next floor.  Now, the sales lady. My dad asks this like 35 year old lady to help us, even tho im a great fashion consultant(lol)- HEy she said the outfit i said was good for mom was good too, so nuh- and she stays with us. She shows him this rabbit coat, and he says he doesnt know. shes all, she wouldnt wear the animal? and hes all, no, its him*points to me* who wouldnt like it. and shes like, look at your shoes. thats a cow. NOT COOL!!!!! Im never wearing those sandals ever again. My sister said they were ugly anyways. And lauren made fun of them. bitch. lol  Well anyways, my dads like, to the lady, shes about ur size, so she tries it on. and hes like staring at her, and gets this little pieace of the coat that got tucked in by accident thats RIGHT BY HER BOOB!!!!!! AHHH. ok. im overreacting. it was above it. but i swear, it seemed like they wouldve kissed if i wasnt there. AHHH not cool. But i mean, it could jsut be how he is. cause he thinks its still the 50's. Hes all nice to strangers, and says hi to babies. He obviously doesnt get that most mothers today would call the police if some 50-year old started playingwhind their back. lol  Crap. his birthday is the 23th. i just realized. when is that.....crap, its soon. What am i gonna get???  Oh yeah, at the end, he didnt even take the outfit i picked out. just some rabbit coat and a shirt. ugh. Then he goes downstairs and gets some leather shoes. and he makes some comment to me about them, and that just totally pissed me off. What the hell. WHY the hell would he make fun of me cause i hate killing animals for their fur?  I ate chicken again. crap.   I seriously am gonna try tho. I feel bad for the animals that died for me to have some semi-good chinese meal. nuh.  ill probably write later. i wanna dance to stacie orrico right now. since im aloooone!!!!  i downloaded 'american jesus' by bad religion. I LOVE IT!!!! i ahve no idea what the hell they mean, but oh well. YEAH!! AWSOME!!! lol  much love  peace  ~alex  PS what happened to brighton?

      I didn't really feel like posting today. I didn't feel like doing anything though. Absolutely nothing happened thouh. I played tropico almost all day. sat around, doing nothing. it was fun tho. better than school.   i didnt talk to brighton. or aisha, til like 6 30. and i didnt talk on phone. i swear, im going to kill something if i dont talk to her soon. IM is too impersonal.   Christmas. Haven't done anyhting for it yet. I dont want to. Christmas has become so commercialized. Plus, anyone ever think about the north pole legend? these little elf people slaving away all year for one day's respite, then being forced back to the grind? That'd be illegal, if they lived here. Sad. I'll just comine gifts with parents for leila, mom for dad, and dad for mom. then i wont ahve to do anything. It's so sad, I enevr get anyone anything. I'm just like, oh yeah, its from me and Mom. But whatever. I don't care  Us heathen children shouldn't care.  I felt really sick coming out the shower. Wonder if it'll come back?   uhhhhhhhhhhh....that was a grunt. not an uhh like i dont know. uhh again. cept shorrter.  blink 182 song is good. just way too short. American songs are like 3 minutes. i hate it, after listening to short arabic songs that last 5-6 mins.   OOWW crap. i just scratched at a flea bite. except like with the nail, so it really hurt. Yes. ou care why?  I'm such a weirdo. Kim was here watching TV with leila, and so i spend a whle putting gel in my hair for that little time im gonna see her. Loooser.  Aisha wont send me the(a) pic. But theres good reason for that. I mean, I'm playing it off like it's nothing. But we both know it's bigger than just a silly pic.   OK. from now on, i'm going to write exaclty what i want on here. Instead of changing some things when i gave this to brighton. I wanted to get back at her then, she should've seen it. Ok then. Yes. Right.  "Marcus, I need to talk to you about something, but u can't tell it to anyone else. What'd you do, man, get a girl in trouble? *sarcasm*Yes, marcus, and now I ahve to marry her."    "aww thats so cute! dont worry TJ, it's not your fault you haven't developed yet. ...That's what i tell myself'   lol, random quotes from smart guy when i watched for 5 mins earlier. It was a good episode. vI liked that show. the first time I saw it was when i was like 6(?) and it was premiering on disney. So i watched it in san diego, when i was on vacation I could see a marina from my window. I liked the show. I still do, it's a lot better then some of the other pure, unmitigated crap disney shows. Dave the barbarian? The proud family? THATS SO RAVEN????  and yet, lizzie mcguire, one of their best shows, is going away. wtf?  Aisha showed me a quote- It's cute how stupid you are. That's SOO her. I'm totally serious. It's not funny how much that's like how I act to her. I'm so mean to her. I pretended to be andy(some random 7th grader at her school) to see what she'd say about me. all I got was that she told karmen about staying up til 4 on the phone with me. HM? EXPLAIN THAT? ehh but karmens her only old friend now, it seems. So i guess whatever. I don't have anyone like karmen, so that's why I haven't really told anyone.   Only my good friend, bloggie. Lol.   In third grade they made us name our binders. Though we called them trappers, dont know why. I called mine reza, since thats my middle name, which it hink is cool. We were told those trappers were our friends and that now, as 3rd graders, they stored our school lives within them. That was a little out there for us, but i guess it prepared us for now, when, i'd shoot myself if i lost my binders. Oh, I ahve three, each for two subjects. So yeah.  I can't think of anything else to say. So yes. I'll leave you to your thoughts.  Let the blood stream down and stain your lives.  I forgot to write the poem online, AGAIN. I dont feel like writing it all up. oh well. sorry allpoetry.com  yes.   good night, sweet dreams.  ill be up. tallking to aisha on phone. til 11ish, cause I'll be forced to go to church tomorrow.  Much love.  I dont wanna end this. its too comforting writing down all my thoughts.  oh well. Love you...  Peace  ~alex  I think i wanna marry the blog. sorry aisha and brighton. lol

      this is good. Brighton ims me from australia, and then gets pissed at me. why do i leave this for people? Im so stupid....i should make it private. no, aisha couldnt see it then...  Yes. so brighton wouldnt tell me why she was mad, while remiaining mad. shes saying now tho..what is she syaing....  hmm. -censor- was right. but i shouldnt write why here. itd be mean. This is sad tho. My first night is spoiled by that. By that flower being ripped. AHH i dont know why that one image depresses me so much. But it does. And i cant get it out of my mind. But at least aria wasnt mad at me. She got a mr wonderful doll from lindsey(it was so sweet) cause her bf broke up with her after 3 months ....it was partially my fault :P   but the doll said things like 'how was ur day at work? want me to rub your feet? and 'the football team is not important to me. I want you to have nice shoes." lol..it was really nice of lindsey.  And yanna gave me chocolate. i felt bad i ahd nothing for her. im getting her something in january. im workng out 'issues' with brighton..lol  i didnt go to kimberly's. shes sick!  degrassi was good. craig got screwed, the bad way, in the end. i love manny, even if she is a slut. tobey's family is jewish. this is the first show ive ever seen where there are more muslims than jews. It's good. Instead of just ignoring the existence of Islam like every other channel does. :P  I liek this thing. I mena, i know its detrimental caus eim posting thoughtsabout people for them to see, but its like talking to a friend. lol. yes. Its fun.  anyways  Much Love!  peace  ~alex, the unloved, hated, and by one, loved

      Fuck. That's all I can say. I just died. the math test...i hate myself. I DIDNT KNOW THE LATS THREE!!!!! AND THERE WAS ONLY 11 QUESTIONS. I MEAN, I KNEW THE FIRST 8, BUT THE LAST THREE...NO IDEA. ahh i didnt want that in caps. oh well..  Oh yes, and to make it all better, an angry brighton has a laptop in australia. What the hell!!!!!!! I mean, I wish I could get on the internet on vacation..but still. I hate this. I hate my life. I myself. Yeah, my life's ok. But I'm not. I screw everything up. *shoots self*. wait- lets say it in spanish! *le dispara a su propio*yay.   Nothing's gone well the last few days, that's for sure. And little things people did didnt make it any better. That's for sure. It's good to know at least AISHA wont get pissed at me for little things. Or flirting or crap. I felt all special today. I wore this new black(the bets color ever) shirt my dad bought, and it was all cool. ANd I was happy. And i slept in. Taht was good. ANd now I'm alone with a teacher. Crap. Jeez..that cared me. She turned around and asked me if I was doing a blog. I thought she'd get mad or something. At least she wasn't. I guess we can do whatever we want in our freetime here. Except porn. Damn. SOrry, aisah, can' open the pics of yourself u sent me. lol j/k  Im gonna go over to kimerly's house after school and watch degrassi at like 5. I need to get out before all of leilas friends come over. And then I'll be alone!!!! I'll probably call Aisha, dnce in the nude(my fantasies are all coming true), read somehting and get depressed, talk to aisha som more, think about everything wrong in my life, talk to aisha about it, think about why Brighton's still mad at me, keep talking to aisha in confusion. Sounds like a night!!!! I wanna stay up til 3ish, cause I always get a better sleep that way. And I want the other shower cap.  And I don't wanna be a lone. but oh well. "that'll do, pig."  I felt persian today. Cause the black made me look darker and more..me? er what i wanna be, and my air was all perfect(in my eyes) so I felt good, for once. I watched music videos at lunch with Sam. They were'nt that good. SOme were though. "money' by pink floyd is not a good song, if you ever wondered about it.  You think posts from a long time ago get rolled off on this? I hope not. Tomorrow I'll have been writing a week! :)  Aisha....a picture. not of kitty, but of the other person in your room at 1 AM. And, once again, not that i want it ro anything, for the reasons previously mentioned.  Liked your email. It was sweet.  I don't remember getting any sweet email from Brighton, hm? lol  Much love  peace  ~alex

      yes...today. was different.-censored- gave me a look as we were on break at math first period..cause. OH YEAH!!! I DDINT SHOW YOU!!!! conversation from last night-   maybe she wants you to love her and only her, not aisha or whatever  i think so, she was kind of jealous that u talked about aisha alot to her or something? she thinks your in love with aisha and shes jealous, she wants you to like her  hm, what to make of it? A friend of mine told em maybe thats what's going on. I changed some of it though, so it didnt sound like the person. It could screw something im working on.   Yes, oi.   AT lunch, the weirdest conversation. me, crystal, rina, and andrea were sitting at a table in middle school, and somehow we get into their first time having a period. Then into all these stories about what dad said..  ONE STORY- FUNNY STUFF....'my brothers came into the room and they were like whatre you doing? and my dad was all, -censor- cna have babies now.' LOL!!!! isnt that great?  another...'i was in guatemala city...and my sister tells me to go to the bathroom alone, cause i ahd a period, in like thsi mall. So, im going, and these three guys start following me. so i go in this store, and try to say in broken spanish that these guys were following me, but since i took french they told me to go away. so they kept following me, and i ran onto a street and all these people were honking at me cause i was white and wearing a mini skirt. SO im like crying in the street until I finally lose the guys..but i get lost. SO after all this time i get back to my sister, still with my period.'  wow. thats great. lol...  yes, that was odd. and dads asking girls what kidn of tamposn they wanted.   THANK GOD im not a girl. I mena, the p-nis gets annoying, but its better than having blood come out of some random hole. Poor girls...  Yes. Whate else happened today...I GETT TO WAKE UP LATE TOMORROW!! im ditching PE...and i go home early, for a free period. i dont know if i want to tho, i mean i wont see anyone. Ill see if i do....I might just relax the last period in joyful bliss. and then say bye to manny and crap. or have sex with her.  and brightons gone, but thats ok.  aishas here. sort of. ill call her for sure tomorrow night..maybe stay up til 4 again.  Theres something between us. she obviously doesnt get it. I mena..something we're not talking about. i know she was hesitant when i told her to send something on her pic phone. She thought yeah. But i dont know if shes still thinking about it. I mean, i want ehr to, but i dont.

      Mhm...Today wasn't really good. Brighton got mad at me me, cause...here...listen..does this make sense?  Last night I let her look at this. Which took more courage then she'd know, seeing as I have no self-confidence and a jealous guarding of privacy. Well, yeah..the first thign she does is scroll down to the first entry. WHich immediately says I love Aisha so mcuh. INTERACTIVE TIME- Scroll down and look for yourself. OOOHHH, technology. yes. Right. So she asks me, you love aisha? I thought you were just friends? Well, see, we are, yeah(with extras ;)), but we've been through a lot so yeah, I love her. That would be ok. I mean, who cares if someone loves someone else? Now's the wird part- why would Brighton care? Now she's mad at me, and won' talk to me, even thoguh I've said hi, sorry a lot, and I GAVE EHR A FLOWER. this really nice rose..and I didn't know she'd feel crappy, so i took the biggest one I could find from a bush at school while a teacher was standing nearby. Those are expnsve!!! ANd i could get in trouble for that. Chhhh but no, whatever. During SPanish, the whoolle time, shes tearing it apart. And whenever she could, she gave me dirty looks. Even Jennifer noticed!!!!!!!!!!  Ack. Why would she care if I loved Aisha?   GIRLS ARE ICKY  lol  they're confusing and mean. I mean, what'd I ever do to her? And then she told Sloane. How incredibly nice of her.  Yay!   Grrrr. Not cool. And what'd worse, she's going to Australia for two weeks tonight. Mhm, at leats I'll be able to write whatever I want?  OH MY GOSH.  lol..christine jsut turned off something...  ANd my screen went off. ANd it all would have gone away. Okay I'm going RIGHT NOW!!!!   Ill call Aisha, maybe. i don't know if i have enough money. Ohw ell  MUCH LOVE  peace  ~alex

      Sorry I havent written. My weeks are hectic, no time. Maybe i'll try to at school. Yeah...  I was so incredibly tired today. But had good food at the shakespear club party. and sable gave me this crad saying she appreciated me joining the club, so i couldnt quit. damn.   I had lots to say. Oh well. I'm too tired to write all the screwed up thoughts I hought of today but here's a taste- heckling Bush, bombing a humvee, wearing a green hexbollah headband, crying, dieing, sleeping, running to texas, making myself sick, etc.   Leilas sick..and so is June. so we might not go to Mammoth. hopefully, i wanna stay with aisha. but going there would be refreshing. Oh well, let what may come, come.  I got on the computer to fnd some weird techno aol screen and buddy lsit. weird people, the yfroze my computer a few times. My computers too slow for good graphics, not that I want them- all this technology is more stuff i dont need.  Saddam...they didnt provide any DNA evidence. I know im not alone in thinking its a look alike(AQSA group unite! lol), but no one at school cares so ill keep to myself about it. But still, we live in an age of technology where almost every court trial has some DNA testing...for blood, for robbery, for everyhting- so why didnt they do any of it? He had so many look alikes..anyways.  AIshas b-day was monday! i sent her 2 e-cards. hat kind of crap am i? I cant give decent gifts anymore. Even if I couldnt get her somehting real, at least something better than that. I wish...  dad came in. that scared me to detah. right...  GOOD NIGHT! Much love and peace  ~alex

      Saddam Hussein was captured. I should be happy, but Im not. I mean, he was a horrible person who's gonna rot in hell for what he did to us(iran), but he was the only hope for the middle east, in a time when the US is controlling more and more of our lives. so yeah, its sad that they captured one of two epople who dare oppose the US, cause the crappy arab leaders kiss americas ass.  anyways. Bertha brought some girl from LA that I knew long ago..She's hispanic so she cant be that bad. Umm..i havent seen ehr yet, she sin shower..and i need to change and take shower..i dont wanna look like crap when i meet her. Oi...  SCHOOL'S OVER THSI WEEK!!!!!!! friday..come soon....i have like 3 or 4 tests this week tho, so crap it all. I'll try to write on here as much as i can.  Though the winter break..I'll be gone a ton.

ARSPICKLES [11:08 PM]:  i live in a perpetual state of feeling crappy about having no life, no friends who seem to really care about me, then going to school and laughing with them, then coming home, having my mom remind me that i dont do anything on the weekends, that im a pathetic lsoer....that for all my hopes and wishes and dreams and thoughts...   i have nothing   u do     ur putting urself down again    no wonder ur like stressed   lol  yeah   true  i do this to myself  but   its not like the world helped  i mean..jenna   that made me feel like shit   like...im never going to be able to be anything real to anyone..i mean yeah, you...i wish you were here so much. i would die just to see you right now...   if i could hug you..i would be so much better, i wouldnt hate myself  i wouldn't be half crying right now  u know, that thing with jenna, she's obviously not worth ur time and u don't have to feel like cryin now u know...    i'll try to do my best   later...    aria was mad at me all week..i still dont know why   and that totally devestated me   cause i loved her smiling back at me when i smiled at her   but she didnt    and im still not srue why   but finally on wed. she forgave me..and hugged me...told me it wasnt my fault  yeah. depressing. thats me. it wouldnt be so bad if my mom didnt stop remindng me that i never go out on the weekends, just talk on the phone for long times..last weekend til 3 AM with..none other..aisha. yeah.  sad music!!! good stuff. first i listened to Kal no Haa, a random indian sad song that i got after typing 'sad' in the imesh download box, then the bangles 'somehting that u said' like 20 times..celine dion and andrew bocelli 'the prayer'..now macy gray ' i try'...that was one of the first songs i remember liking. before that i remember seeing an ace of base music video on fox when i was 2 and watching batman, as my mom slept behind me. i woke up at crazy hours back then. freak boy.  im so freaking tired. but ill stay up for aisha. i hope aol doesnt mess up..yeah. until next time.   ~alex

      You promised me Just me and you  You promised me the moon and the sun, the birds in the sky You promised me a wonderful life, they were only lies You promised me all diamonds and pearls that I never got You promised me red roses and gold but soon you forgot  You promised me Just me and you  You promised me I could be your queen and you’d be my king You promised me a white wedding dress, where is the ring? You promised me your tender caress your kisses at night So try to show it wasn’t in vain coz I’m wasting my time  You promised me Just me and you  Tu Es Foutu Tu tu tu tu   I don’t know what to do with my life But I know my rule is no second chance You promised me You promised me You promised me  Tu Es Foutu Tu tu tu tu tu   You promised me Tu Es Foutu You promised me YOU ARE SCREWED UP...  So..let's go over this again. You promised me. You didn't deliver. Fuck you.          Hm....yes. I think Brighton and DJ broke up. If they did, that's really sad. I hope they didn't. but Brighton has been really sad. Today she smiled at me in math, but ignored em later and was obviously not having a nice day. and gave DJ a dirty look, tho he might not have seen it. I'm too short compared to all 6 feet of him.   Tu es Fouto is a really good song....i dont really have any reason to use it. but thats ok. love to aisha. i need a girlfriend..lol  not that im ever gonna get one..at least til summer. lol... ill meet a whole new bunch of girls and wont look like as much of a dirk. lol...  oh well.   math...first double block..it was funnish in the corner, tho still boring class. at least it was just us reviewing problems without much structure. during free i talked to neena for a long time, about all sorts of things. It was her birthday! she refused to tell me tho because she didnt want me to bring anything. sad....tomorrows yanna's birthday. ill bring her a teddy bear i guess. ill find a barbie for christmas to give to her someday....  i talked to adrienne after school yesterday. i missed talking to her in a while, so it was funny. i sort of made my mom wait like 5-10 mins tho, lol. she kept trying to make sure i saw her.   last night my dad said i was NOT ever wearing a turban. he said it wasnt persian culture. ugh, it has been for the last 25 years, so get over it. then i asked about shalween kameez(a long shirt with baggyish pants, all white) he said thats pakistan. screw pakistan. lol..he told me to wear a suit. or to wear a black turtleneck with a sports jacket like the persian in westwood. thats VERY persian. ugh.  he then proceeded tot ell me about a persian tribal thing. which happened to be a shalween kameez with a belt and fez. weird persians; cant take anything thats arab or mutt- always need to make it their own.  umm....oh, i woke up really late this morning, so id dint have time to shower or do anythign with my hair. people played with it.   i hope brighton isnt still starving gerself  need go  much love   bye

      mhm, back in the computer lab........listening to 'baila casanova' by paulina rubio....  after school i had to go to a meeting for people going to spanish in the spring....it was a bit sad- the vast majority of the like 15 people had never left the United States. Mhm, and it is asked why americans know so little of other cultures... i had to miss the model UN thing for it, so im doing my presentation next week....  ya know what? penises suck. cause ur trying to sleep, and theres this stick on your leg...ack. its sucky. lol  now, to explain my dreams...first. i was in my house, but in the front of my house was a dusty road with like..you know on drive throughs, how a thing from the main building comes over your head and and goes toi the ground, making a little passage for you? well, one of those. and a bunch of white CCC vans were going through, for mexico..so iw as sitting with some pajamas i ahd whnen i was 11..and i was trying hard to hide this..like..dildo woman. they had one in american wedding, so why not? lol...so iwas asking my dad to let me go back(i guess we'd been there the past few days, but this was a schoolday) and he said no..until i said i hated him and then explained a little more...so i went...and i was wlaking through this like Old Western town, except in the same location as Monte de SIon. and i was tlaking to juan and eating a cookie, and he said people had tlaked about 'the pig', me, while i was gone. in dreams, i always understand spanish fully. well then i was in tirane, albania(a really ugly, concrete city in a poor country in europe..its in one of my favorite books) and i was looking for uggs. my dad brought me purple ones, but i sort of didnt like them so i got bright blue ones instead. i didnt buy it tho...but som black guy from greece(he had a tag that said so) helped us....really odd.  I think the pig thing was because of brighton. since she snot eating. and thinks shes fat. ack. so it dawned on me i was fat or something? mhm, who knows. i just wish i had seen omyra in the dream. *masturbates*...just kidding. lol  aisha asked me the other day how she shoudl feel, just as i was leaving to sleep. i told her happy, cause she was perfect. i think it was a good answer. lol :)  next dream....with.nobody but..Brighton. mhm.  well it started out, i opened the door to our foyer(thats a funny word...i found out like a week ago that its like the entrance part of a house) for outside, and roya jumps out and runs like hell. so i expect her to stop at adams house, cause she did that once. she lieks his dog. but this time she ran really fast down the street, and i lagged behind her..so hilary duff came in a white van and opened the door, and roya jumpped in and they drove off. hilary duff had a blue butterfly shirt on. lol, i remmember that from her CD cover. so they went off...and i was like 'oh crap'. but suddenly i was back in front of my house, and my dad was like, lets go out. and i couldnt say no(i dont know why) so iw ent, nervously...and then we're out in a street that looekd like downtown ensenada, and i told him we were looking for a white van, but he guessed it was a truck i guess. so we see one, with Brighton, DJ and caitlin riding in it. and i see roya there too...so we follow...but we lose them...then we're back at the house.and i  see them going down on our pretty street.....just casually driving by. bitches. lol  anyways.....grandmas was fun...well, michael was. my abuela(not senile, mind you) has a horribly low tolerance level, so she got pissed at andrew, the 7 year old other cousin. i think hes mexican too..or maybe guatemalan. well, no matter, different dad from michael. we looked at pictures form the 70's..watched movies. i found out on friday my abuela grew up in south carolina for 2 years, after moving from NY. seems they followed her brother around in the army cause dad deserted them  horribly sad, especially for the 50's  in tech we watched a video of....Billy Joel um...lemme check. here....'we didnt start the fire'....it was a powerful thing, if u nderstood what he was syaing. not that pretty much anyone did. cause no one understood the events he talked about. see, he had been arguing with this younger person in like 1989, and the kid had said the msot important events in history were happening at that time. he disagreed and said his life had had important things. so the song is a long bunch of events with a chorus interrupting eveyr minute. and the events were horribly depressing...well, most. but the meaning was lost on everyone else. cause we watched this video some kid at caltech u. had put together of all the evnts as slides with the song as background....  mhm...then math...which was, as usual, funny. well, probably not for the rest of the class, but we had fun in the back corner. well, i did? lol  then free...once again, i talked to neena too long..then i did badly on an english quiz, which iw as supposed to have studied before during my free. then lunch...i had bad food, so i got a muffin..but i ate it all, and had a HORRID stomache ache during biology. he was late, so we almost had a free. the second half we just went outside and looked at plants and decided whteher they were..mono or di-something....during lunch i had to go to multi cultural club, wher ei signed myself up to write a blurb on malcolm X for some black history assembly in 2 weeks.  but id dont get it? are black people better than hispanics? hispanic heritage month was sept 15 to october 15th, but no one gave a shit then. so..whats up with that? are blacks more 'cultural' or something? lol  after school..i left my back pack upstairs...so then i ran like hell to model UN to say i couldnt present...then i ran back quickly cause melanie didnt wanna be the only 9th garder in the spanish meeting. so then i sat there, half dead....then afterwards, i went downstairs, then afterwards i had to go upstairs, after walking to middle school and back..and ack. it was shitty.'  it seems the boy im staying with in valencia, spain is an avid soccer fan. i hope i dont have to run that much. lol  i can do it, i guess. i beat mexicans at soccer in june, why not?  he also has visited mineesota once, on an exchange trip, and has good english. ehh...oh well. he's also a good student. but melanie said her girl sound slike a dork. lol..i dotn see it tho. the girl visits france often and is a good student..she lieks reading. i guess? not really. lol  jeez. ive been writing for 35 mins...well, what else would i do? this is better than sitting aorund without a purpose.   well, i gotta go. 3 30. time for home.  AHHH THIS IS THE BEST SONG. again. FRIJOLERO..   la fama que somos vendedores....de la droga que sermbramos..ustedes son consumidores....lol.. i love it. theyre talking about havinf fame for being crack-dealers. lol  Much love  peace  Hot stuff,   ~alex

      back in the library...some Middle school class was in the comp lab. i get really nervous here for some reason.   15 days til ring dance. ugh, its horribly pathetic that i diecided to count down the days to a danc eim not going to because i have no one to go with. cause no one would ever want to go with me. for obvious reasons. Mhm, aisha, i think we're gonne have to change the running to mexico thing to when im 17 and just done with high school- i doubt ill be free at 16.   mhm....  brighton has some eating problem. i dont know anything about it, except that its horribly odd happening days before some assembly on anorexia and bulemia. khoda, this is one of those truman show moments. thats an awesome movie.  mhm..me and sam talked awhile after we got out(we have free last so we get out early..now brighton does too)...not the most interesting conversation. jennifer made sex noises at spanish break while catherine rubbed her back. nice  Yay, my parents dont come back til tomorrow....freedom. sort of. itd be better if i was fully alone. i wish...  hm, something funny happened today. brighton said 'whats up' er whatever in the hall, and i started to reply but i saw DJ and raN away. im scared of him sort of.  mhm..havent talked jasenko in the longest time...nor a bunch of other people. oh well. its not like i really care about most of them.   12 mins left...  today was nice....but i looked like crap, again. not that i look ok often. but today was crap day. as opposed to a shit day. TTomorrow no school. yay. Thank God.  We talked about drugs in human. i think cortney lied to me a lot of the summer about everything that happened....fuck her for that. a lot of my summer was crappy for her. i seriously doubt she overdosed and was raped...like 5 times..anymore. mhm, she was so sad and believable too. oh well. bitch. the only reason is that andie and dyna  said some things...which led me to believe shes a liar. so anywyas, onwards...  This one guy is scared of me cause i told him im communist. lol. on the prez debates last night, kucinich got more applause than any of the other candidates. only one time when he talked was he not applauded. but no one is gonna vote for him anyay, sadly. poor guy. and he had to live inc ars pasrt of his childhood too.  im gonna walk to the store with ceci after school today i think. im not sure if ill have enough energy to make it tho.   oo...lol....it says on the board in the front of the room that u cant use these comps for anyhting but research and typing. i thought afterschool anything was ok. oh well. the senile librarian has to see it before she can end me to o'brien, no?  i have 4 minutes left. im gonna go on NS for like 2, than pack up my stuff and make sure my abuela doesnt come looking for me.  i hate the word grandma. doesnt abuela sound kinder? and less senile?  much love  peace  ~alex  'life is a bitter tune with sad refrain'

      *has kidney failure and falls over dead*  im gonna start from the beginning here....  english..what a bore. first 40 mins we could do english homework from night before cause it was long and we were originally supposed to have 2 days, not one....um...2nd half..i really dont know what i did...and i cant remember. Oh! yeha, we went over our homework. it was boring, but not exhausting like it usually is. The...assembly. Khoda, that was odd. It was joint Chinese New Years and Eating Disorders for our theme.   but it was less awkward than i thought. they did quick thing with the chinese language students (among which there were only 3 chinese people) where they said a new years phrase. interesting.  than for 30 mins a woman acted out a monologue of 4 different people about a girl with an eating disorder. it was good. but at the end, they had a panel of 5 people come out to answer questions about eating disorders....but, why would you ask a real question in front of 1,200 other people? people asked about stats and stuff. Mhm.  First half of biology we talked about(they talked, i thought about cheering up Jennifer) it and jennifer cried next to me. im not sure if it was about eating disorders? or what? maybe a friend? who knows. i drew on a paper and gave it to her, but she left it afetr class and i took it.  it had a heart with hands trying to hug, and it said dont worry be happy. on the bottom i wrote 'mhm..pathetic...oh well' or soemthing. but thats ok.  we then proceeded to talk about vascular systems of plants. fuck plants.  history....history of the money system was boring, but the second part was actually rather fun..and..interesting. lol, that was only cause we tried to interpret political cartoons instead of taking hard notes or anything.  hmm...the republican junior (i dont know his name..just know hes very republican..lol..he could be senior) is doing some story on irans revolution and someone who was there during it. theyre looking over it (him and ms allen)..ack accents are really annoying. Ooooo theyre tlaking about khomeini. im sure hed crucify me (pun intended, its not really a pun, but ok) if he knew that we were related and i ahve pictures in my photo albums of him.   Long live kHomeini. lol   how the hell did this guy run to pakistan? its hundreds of miles from tehran? hed die in the desert? oh well.  back to today... lunch..i ate with aria at first, then walked around with coke and cookie. i saw sara at the book fair and her mom was there.....it seems that she 'babbled' about me 'freshy this..'  ugh. what lies. he is syaing that the US and UN saved him from indian deportation to iran and further execution. damn biased republicans. lol  ahh i should stop.  then..PE...i ditched and sat with rina...she put her head on my lap for awhile...then i left her, after she left me, and went around with lauren...then got rina and brought her to us..she had been talking to jess, making up with her or somethign cause she unintentionally said something bitchy to her...lol  then...spanish..we got to see our tests. we elarned the future..which..i...already...knew.... but ok.  mwahaha, inredibly simple. but thats ok. ill ignroe this fact.  it seems my momc alled him about my final. KHODA MAN-E!!! CHERA?? Ach, i was fine. 88 is awesome for a final. and yet she calls about it., that is so incredibly..UGH. but they continued talking and he invited to go to my spain on some special trip he hosts.....even tho im going in march....but thats ok..id rather stay with roberto in argentina...but why did she talk to him about that? ach, what about me knowing the future..lol..anything? just to get out of that.  mhm, brighton had some weird problem with food or something. theres three thing sit coudl be. Oh, she asked me if i had read her LJ and is aid i lost my password so i couldnt and she said good, cause she had written somew weird stuff about food. the tan bitch. that was loving. so its either:  a) she has eating problem/disorder b) she used it for 'bad' things/*cough* cant say that wrod. young ears. or, c) somehtign happened with food that doesnt matter.   alright.  i should go..i saw mom come like 5 mins ago...  much love  peace  ~alex

      its afterschool......again. today was a boring day, pretty mundane, except for the fact that I talked to aria via note during english about evan..her old boyfriend....seems he has a new girlfriend and he invited aria to come meet her. i told her that she needed a new boyfriend to make him jealous, and hinted that i would be good for a fake boyfriend to kiss. lol. like when i gave her my number after she broke up with him. hey, that time it was out of concern. i said if she needed anything, call me. not that i wanted to date her. mhm.  so i called her a bitch in a loving way and told her not to appear weak. she didnt really take my advice. but thats ok.  what happened today else.....double math...it was ok, quicker than a double block usually is, though i did get a bit lost. during free...i talked to neena the whole time. for an hour and a half. we made fun of ourselves sort of, by pretending to be all fundamentalist and gossiping like old maids about the looseness of her cousin and the like. shes south indian. oh yes, we also talked about the inferiority of the mutt people, ie the arabs, pakistanis, north indians, bengalis, etc. i looked tanner today.   today was a goodish day for my face, since i didnt care as much and i liked my shirt.  last night aisha called me..30 mins after she said she would. lol...she was supposed to tell me the incredibly private thing she had said shed tell me after she talked to kay while i was in mexico, but she just called to say goodnight. grrreat.   she thought  i liked whitney since what iw rote about being her girlfriend. mhm no, sorry. whits 15. and hot. ie out of my range. lol  comp lab was closed, so im in the library...............im more vulnerable. lol  I got a 91% on my math and 85% on english! thank God three of my tests were curbed though. on math i woudlve gotten a 72 without curb(like half the class got a D even with the curb...everyone around me had lower than 70)..on english, i dont think mrs klemme rlikes me. on the multiple choice, where she couldnt take anything off because of her feelings, i got 85 out of 95.....in the first 50 questions, missed only 1..but on the short answers and essays, where she could take it off out feelings, she tried to kill me.  i got 6/10 on the three short answers, and some sucky grade(i think a Cish) on the essay. Thank God i dont get to take the test home so my parents can see that. i got an 88 on the history multiple choice test i took yesterday.  my dad got very pissed at me in car today. because of my final scores. ugh. finals are harder to do well on than other things; he should bitch at me as much for them. so technically im gorunded; well, i can go out, but no TV and computer til end of year during week. ill still do it tho, as long as mom doesnt know about the thing...ie in like 2 or 3 weeks.   What i know of scores:  History:81 on final, 88 on 75 pt multiple choice test, 85 semestre grade. Math: 91 on final(only A), 92 or 3 on quarter, b or b+ por semestre English: 85 on final... 92 por semestre Biology: 80 on final(76 w/o curb); 82 on quarter, 80 por semestre..i think..i dont remember fully... Spanish: 88 on final...94 or 5 por semestre, since that class is simple. see the main two things we're gonna do this year are the habia tense(could be span 4) and the future tense(next chapter). i know both already. so ill try to get out of this, tho maybe next week when my finals arent fresh on my parents minds. sofia taught me too much. for a span 2 final, she taught me the futurue tense, just in case. oi  fuck, mrs klemmer just walked behind me. we talked about her at lunch like 2 weeks ago..very unpleasant. ie, who would have sex with her?????? and can u picture this gentle lady moaning er that crap? khoda, it was frightful.  yes, thats my new thing. khoda. it means God in farsi, so why not.  i forgot to mention. a persian tutor came on sunday. she was surprised i could read and write farsi. which was absolutely no help from my dad, thank you very much. even all of my grammar was my own doing. i taught myself his language. i dont get why hes against it or whatever. just out of spite, im gonna go to the university of tijuana and make a business in iran. lol...he wants me to go to ivy league.  fuck the ivy league.  i have 15 mins...but ill probably play a game..or..better yet..print something and waste this schools resources, without my parents knowledge. yay!!!!!  see you later..  much love  peace  ~alex.    oh yeah, im going to argentina in the summer(probably), dont remember if i said so

MEXICANS ARE SO HOT! and so cute. they all wear their uniform skirts after school......AHHHHHHHH its soooooo cute. lol...i wanna go live down there. yes. but there were so many books about sex in the book shops. 'el orgasmo feminino' was in front in one, and 'el punto 'g'' was another big seller on the side, overpowering books about politik. damn sexual mexicans. not that i mind.  hold on. ill brb. tech teacher talking about TV..we're watching 50s crap.  eww ed sullivan show.  k...hm..still watching it....stars from the 50's. elvis presley was good..then someone and the vandellas..now i just forget this guy..'how lucky a poor man can be'..mhm...  back to mexico. while my dad was in the shower and i watching Tv there, i realized why shady motels have HBO. lol....yes..then i woke up the next morning..we drove to ensenada...i went thru rosaritos main street for the first time instead of just passing it...it s way too american to be in mexico. but jen grew up there.   ensenada was fun...walked thru downtown..overrun by three cruise ships of tourists...i bought a CD(awesome) and a shirt with EZLN and marcos on it, alone with something he said in spanish. nice stuff.  i have to write more in 5 mins when class ends. people are getting suspicious. all monitors should be off..  oh my gosh. freddy and the dreamers...theyre such dorks. do the freddie? fish out of water? lol  alright, school over. just helping mandy and..fuck. whats her name. i NEEEED to know this. this is like when i forgot jess's name. ANDREA! wooh, i got it.  mexico...drove back....2 HOURS AT THE BORDER. more than ive ever stayed there. in all the times ive crossed. listened to music...forever...frijolero!!! by molotov..really bad song, but funny.  FOR AISHA, MY FAJITA:  Cuando me miras asi Perdido estoy Cuando me miras asi Contigo voy Que puedo hacer Tus ojos son  El imán de mi corazón  Cuando me miras así Completo estoy Cuando me miras así. Yo se quien soy No pido mas es lo mejor Eres el angel luz de mi amor  En ti puedo ver la libertad Tu me haces sentir que puedo volar Y se que aquí es mi lugar Y se que a ti yo quiero amar  Cuando tu me miras asi Cuando tu me miras asi No hace falta nada más Solo ganas siento de amar.  Cuando me miras asi Perdido estoy Cuando me miras asi Contigo voy Que puedo hacer Tus ojos son El iman de mi corazon.  Cuando me miras asi Completo estoy Cuando me miras asi Yo se quien soy No pido mas es lo mejor Eres el angel luz de mi amor  En ti puedo ver la libertad Tu me haces sentir que puedo volar Y se que aquí es mi lugar Y se que a ti yo quiero amar.  Cuando tu me miras asi Cuando tu me miras asi No hace falta nada mas Solo ganas siento de amar  En ti puedo ver la libertad Tu me haces sentir que puedo volar Y se que aquí Es mi lugar Y se que a ti yo quiero amar  En ti puedo ver la libertad Tu me haces sentir Que puedo volar Y se que aquí  Es mi lugar Y se que a ti yo quiero amar.   thats a really good song. im looking for frijolero's lyrics...  Yo ya estoy hasta la madre  de que me pongan sombrero  escucha entonces cuando digo  no me llames frijolero.   Y aunque exista algún respeto  y no metamos las narices  nunca inflamos la moneda  haciendo guerra a otros países.  Te pagamos con petróleo  e intereses nuestra deuda  mientras tanto no sabemos  quien se queda con la feria.   Aunque nos hagan la fama  de que somos vendedores  de la droga que sembramos  ustedes son consumidores.   Don't call me gringo,  You fuckin beaner  stay on your side  of that goddamn river  don't call me gringo,  You beaner.   No me digas beaner,  Mr. Puñetero  Te sacaré un susto  por racista y culero.  No me llames frijolero,  Pinche gringo puñetero.   Now I wish I had a dime  for every single time  I've gotten stared down  For being in the wrong side of town.   And a rich man I'd be  if I had that kind of chips  lately I wanna smack the mouths  of these racists.  Podrás imaginarte desde afuera,  ser un Mexicano cruzando la frontera,  pensando en tu familia mientras que pasas,  dejando todo lo que conoces atrás.   Si tuvieras tú que esquivar las balas  de unos cuantos gringos rancheros  Las seguirás diciendo good for nothing wetback?  si tuvieras tú que empezar de cero.   Now why don't you look down  to where your feet is planted  That U.S. soil that makes you take shit for granted  If not for Santa Ana, just to let you know  That where your feet are planted would be Mexico  Correcto!  funny stuff...i mean, i dont get some of the spanish, but oh well..*pretends*  i would like to reiterate- mexican chicks are hot. lol...  i saw another hot person at costco on sunday. the damn fag was socking bags. i hope he goes to hell for his looks. lol...im so mean. but its true. that day i felt shitty i think. today i feel ok, yesterday i felt good. i dont mind today., because im im cool, yes, lol..i listened to my illegal CD player today..:P..all in the halls...  the sportsish people are standing around watching a viepwoint advertisement video. theyre the people who coach sports....i dont like them much.   mandy and andrea left.  brighton ignored me...or she was just being normal. mhm, hard to grasp.  ahh i havent talked to aisha in 2 days..im free. lol...what happened today...i got an 80.0 on my bio(good, but he said id probably get a B chh), 81% on history(i feared the DBQ..but she liked my thesis! yay) and...88% on spanish. looking back, the scores arent as good as they seemed before i looked at them. but oh well. im ok. the history mideterm today went easily. i finished about a minute before time ended, slow for me but i dont care, i was relaxing half the time. all i have to do is some spanish sentences due thrusday. its moronic, hes reviewing right before going on to the future tense, which i already have memorized. and then, in spanish 4, we'll do the habia tense, which i know too. woohoo.  im going to argentina in the summer. along with iran. and mexico. and somehwere else with family, since this is the last summer my sister'll be with us. alright. im gonna go on NS since I'm never able to at home, then, if i have time(lol), ill do the spanish.  love you  peace  ~alex

      Hello...  I'm in a rather sad mood. Well, an OK one.  I love this song. "Going Under" by Evanescence. She's incredibly talented. I want to get her CD, but who knows if i will? I found some NOW arabias at borders, but i doubt ill find time to buy those.   I'm going to Tijuana tomorrow. Yay me. But we might go further south to Ensenada instead, since I know that city a lot better.     On to real things. I told whitney my secret. lol....but im in denial-ish right now, so whatever. im fine. im good. she and pat broke up, after ALL that. It makes me think life isnt worth much, if like a month and a half ago she was sobbing because Pat had gone off with someone else..and then he fucking ignored her the last 2 weeks. What a pig. If whitney had been my girlfriend, I would've held her and never let her go. Why do bastards who treat their girlfriends like shit get ahead, while everyone else watches in despair at those they secretly love be dragged away and beaten by a guy the girl thinks she loves? Ugh.    Qod, this is making me depressed. Like why I'm alone? lol.... I shall find somebody. Yeah, ok, you keep telling yourself that old boy. Maybe ooone day it'll come true. Uh huh, ok. I'm such shit.  *continues lsitening to Going Under* oh..another song downloaded..but i like this one too much to change it.  Me and aisha talked on the phone for a while. i think about 50 mins, cause the phone kept disconnecting. well, once she hung up on me after i threatened to do that to her if she didnt tell me what she had been doing with the boyfriend she ahd troubles with before me. I mean, I didn't help it, I was a big reason in the end that she broke up with him. hah. good times. Someone actually put me ahead of someone else they knew..for once...SEE!! Thats why I love aisha. Because she doesnt make me feel like shit. she doesnt make me feel like im a secondary person, just there to talk to when everyone else is gone. which is what everyone else does. UGH. Thanks AIsha.  I was gonna tell everyone that I knew you were having sex witht he boy before me when we first sort of met like exactly a year ago, but i decided not to. Hah. whoops. i just did. lol...it lightened the mood? yeah, alright, ill stick to that.   I think...I think a major reason i used to be so depressed is because I thoguht/knew that if I killed myself, or shot myself or something, people at school wouldnt care. I mean, I don't think ONCE anyone like...appreciated me being there, i guess. I mean... once. i rememebr. in 6th grade. paulina was crying and i comforted her. she was always nice to me after that. but..ugh. now lets fast forward to this year. lauren..was crying once, and she was a total bitch to me from the time i liekd her til then. SHe said she was really sorry and stuff, and tried to help. SHe's been nice to me like before, and that's really good. better than i ever got at oaks.  THATS WHAT I HATE. Poeple treated me like a shitbag. a total shitbag. They were total hypocrites. Practically all of them. This idea of a loving Christian middle was fucked. It could have just been for me. I mean...I  liked being a lone, but having people to talk to. There were so few people so it wasnt my fault i was a lone a lot... and arian, who id di become friends with, was a total dork in 7th grade. In 6th grade, we were friends. the next year...he became weird. Garrett...um...i guess he was ok. David too. But they were total weirdos, in a bad way. AHH why am i talking about them? i dont know.  Christine. I had a friend in her. Maybe not fully at school, but she could be really nice. Though usually not at school. But still really nice.   Kaitlyn was nice, but not around anyone else. A total bitch then. In the play and on the phone and then..she was nice. But when lauren popped up. Here comes the bitchosaurus. ugh. I ahted people like that, with two faces. ANd she liked me..but when i gave her a love poem... she shoved it in my face. and showed it to so many people.    'so it was from u, im sry iwas a bitch back then and i reallly hurt ualex cuz i knew u liked me. and u preolly h8 me now. 4give me? friends again?'  she told me a while ago. but i shouldve said no. i shouldve said no to lauren too. But im so weak...cause i think whatever i can get is the best ill ever have.  HOLY HELL. The screen jsut went off, and I thought everything I wrote was gone. That scared th ehell out of me. Well I'm gonna go now. Thanks for listening to my rant, thought I doubt brighton is still reading lol.  oh...below...this was up towards the top, but ir ealized it was boring so i put it at the end since i dont really care if you read it. :) lol  u can skip done to where i say the endings...    I was playing NS and got to a resolution vote. It was about euthanasia. I eloquently stated why the measure should be legalized.   "It is equal then[the voting in the region]...But, after reading the resolution, i feel compelled to fight for the rights of that little boy. This law does violate some sovereignty; yes, but so does any law forbiding slavery or demanding human dignity, as this one tries to do. By not going too far into the issue, it has allowed each nation the right of choosing certain things. Like, at what age will this be legal? For whom? What constitutes a debilitating or life-threatening disease? It is completely up to you. And thus I believe that this law will promote human dignity and cultivate a respect for a person's right to choose their life's path.  Personally, I have doubts about the concept of euthanasia. But I see no reason why those who are more sure, and know they will have to suffer for years without this procedure, shouldn't be allowed to make a choice like this. Would you rather have those with AIDS jumping out of windows? We do not know their pain. And thus we must respect their right to choose what they do with their life. We attempt to give individuals every other possible right; why not extend to them the privilege of deciding when pain has become too overbearing?"  We all take that game way too seriously. But it provides a forum for discussion on everything, and its interesting. You can see people from every walk of life discuss every subject imaginable, from virginity to Bush to Slavery. Bet you didnt know there are around 27 million slaves in the world? Some estimates say up to 20 million in India alone(the highest at 100 million), but those are probably innacurate. There are thousands of slaves in the US. sad isnt it?  Yes, very sad.  ENDING PART  yes..here we are...this is incredibly long. but u know i love you. And so with my heart I say  Much love  peace  ~alex  La ill Qalbi. Never Without Consulting the Heart.

Look at math. SEE, thats how you ace a final without studying!!!!! (please dont use that against me when i get a D) lol.  hm..ive had incredibly...umm..i dont know. bad thoughts. that i cant write here. or tell anyone. i shall write it in my other. horribly personal thoughts. and ive been cussing way too much. ach. *tries to worship aisha and learn the other way*  brightons on. but i think shes mad at me? ehh, i have like a 75% chance of being right. she seems especially cold when jennifer asked her where our final for spanish is tomorrow. ill figure that out tomorrow though.  ahh tijuana in two days. yay. i wish someone else could come too, but im still fine. ill enjoy it.   i cant think of much else. except that i wish school started at 10 and ended at 12 instead of 8 to 10. mhm. yes.   happy thoughts.  off to right sad ones in other blog.  much love  peace  ~alex

      Finally, time to write. Well, not really. I'm suppsoed to be in human development, but i ditched it to come talk to you, and talk about all the exciting things ive done. friday- went to downtown for food. saturdya- studied osme, but i did nothing most of the day, until 2ish. i did some math studying for an hour at 9 30, then watched something about the history of nazis in america. it was sort of scary. lol...at 12 i was forced to sleep.   Church the next morning, because, I was, as always, forced to go. Grrreat. I sat in the back and one point argued with him, sort of, cause i asked him..lemme think..Oh yeah! He said that God was in Jesus, so thats why he was special. But then i asked, the bible says everyone has the spirit in them. so arent we all God? Then he went into this big thing about how the erath started that really did not relate. he summmed it up at the end somehow saying i was wrong. whatever.  i stuidied a lot...at 2 i went to brightons house....at 5 i came back and studied....then watched 60 minutes while i ate since my dad was watching it. it was funny, even though a lot of it shouldnt have been. then i dis work, talked to aisha, and went to watch aamerican dreams. it was an ok episode, but the one next week looks really good, meg calls her mom a tramp after her mom gets mad at her for going swimming with all these people and making out with drew. mhm.   today....nothing exciting. but im gonna have to study like hell tonight. staying til 4 here for bio, going home, leaving at 6 30ish for grandmas(who used to be bio teacher).  hm. this morning during PE/free, rina airhumped me. it wa sinteresting. A few other things happned....caity's girlfriend walked by and saw me, jessie, and rina, woner what she thought. oh yah! in spanish me and brighton found out we did the project wrong, so she got pissed at me cause she had wanted it to be perfect.

      Aisha is telling me something..errr...not really. im trying to extract it. SHe's being stubborn, as always. its about me and jess too. ack.  ﻭﯾﺴﮑﻠ ? ~  ill write more later, but now i have not much to say. im going to get pizza. mm.  oh, and aisha says jess still thought me and aisha were..umm....yes. a thing. lol, i said the singing doesnt help.    "u can sing to me if u want to. it's our bussiness, besides,... u have other things"  lol, that's good, that's good.  hm, julia is a weird, annoying, twit. she said she call my mom cause i called her a bitch. dear God. oh, there was some other stuff too, but yes. nothing much else to do. except demand more of what jess said.   ~~A few hours later~~  This night was different. Two people blew me off. lol thats good, i feel loved. Brighton went to sleep at 7 ig uess? And i look like a stalker, cause i imed her a few times while her message was on..oh well. I'll just go back to my first love(s), shannon and company.good idea alex old boy.  ﺎﺷ?? is still confusing me. AHH i still cant get over it that farsi works on this. (that was aisha) oh, and I found out she had another secret back-door, midnight lover besides rene. Some OTHER boy!!! she sure gets around.   Let's talk about rene (ﻲﻧﯾﺮ). in september, aisha decided to go kiss, makeout with, and then GET TO THIRD BASE WITH a boy named rene. Good stuff, man, good stuff. And listen to this- She wasnt even riding the white pony! I mean, woah, not like her. She said she doesn't even liek him. Now what would she do with someone she did like.....*cough* Jess. wait. holy crap. She liked me. Hm....oh yeah. Hah, I can't write that stuff. *runs away giggling*  The virgin eyes looking at this(brighton! look away!) should not see these kinds of things. Thus, I will refuse to write them, and uphold my standards. Hah. Yeah. I ahve those. Riiight. I mean, I went out with Aisha!........just kidding!!! lol  Now I'm arguing with aisha over her looking like a slut.   [10:52 PM]:  course ur not like... Mr. twinkle toes either   Let's see what that means....Holy hell! what in hell does thta mean?!   [10:54 PM]:  yea, excuse my while i brush crumbs off ur breasts   OHHHHH. WOW. 7 minutes later, I get that. It's a reference to something that happened in october. Well, I had to beg her to tell me what the hell she was saying, and finally i figured out it was about the time i touched/molested rina. and that was the butt. so how was i supposed to get it?! Hm, oh well.  right, back to asking about rene. The one question remaining, that'll make aisha sad. i bet if i keep making references to her being a slut, she wont be sad. lol hmm... i didnt need to. that was incredibly simple.   [11:06 PM]:  If you were having sex with someone you'd tell me? right? or if you were using tampons(practically the same thing, except ur letting paper violate you instead of a guy)?  crap her answer isnt at all reassuring.   [11:06 PM]:  y do u ask?  OH MY GOODNESS U SLUT lol  [11:07 PM]:  omg, no! *laughs* seriously tho?   [11:07 PM]:  because i dont want you to like go do something and me not know anything about it....cause then i feel left out..lol..*cries and turns on sesame street* [11:08 PM]:  i'd nvr leave duckie behind! but... i dind't think...yea   aw ok im happy. im good. im down. forget that two people blew me off. AISHA didnt!!! which makes me cool. tho im guessing the reason is because things are too awkward between her and jess(the rapist/lover of her) that since he didnt come on, i was second best. lol  [11:09 PM]:  that you'd want me to tell u that much   [11:10 PM]:  lol [11:10 PM]:  well u dont ahve to tell me the tampons thing..if you dont WANT to [11:11 PM]: wanna talk about my underwear now?  the rest of the conversation cannot be showed here. sorry brighton, i know you wanted to know what im wearing. ;)  on phone: "what are you wearing..ehhe...I bet you can see right through that..' chris who are you talking to?? 'grandma...' oh ok.  ~el alexio feo  PS im going to tijuana on friday for one night trip after finals. yay. 'tijuana- do ya wanna?'

So, all through the conversation I was like... "well, should i... or not... He stopped askin and I shouldn't bring it up. sooo yes?" I paniced and I couldn't laugh today. I ran out of laughs.

      "I sit in the park where I dwell, For this boy I love so well. He took my heart away from me, Now he wants to set me free. I see a girl on his lap,  He says things to her he never said to me. I ran home to cry on my bed,  Not  a word to mother was said. Father came home late that night, He looked  at me from left to right. He saw me hanging from a rope, He took his knife   to cut me down. And on my dress a note was found: Dig my grave, Dig it  deep.   Dig my grave, From head to feet. And on the top place a dove. And   remember this, I died for love... "  I didn't find to get on after school like usual cause I asked for help from ms elliott and mr koetke. it was good, though i hope i remember it for the tests coming up.... FINALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AHHHH!!!! but i ahve friday off, thank God, and I get off early on thursday. It might be everyone, but I've been making myself feel special by saying it's because I have fewer classes than anyone else. Yay me.  I stacked up shoulderpads in PE today. It was oh so much fun. Mhm.  ANother mundane today. Though I found out that Andrea and Mary Lane were talking about me, God knows why. They got in an argument about my name, cause andrea said my anem was alex shams(crap, the hell's her last name? Or anyone's for that reason?!!!) or alex reza. they both won in the end. lol  Um...Not much else happened. I'm thankful it was mundane, because it was quick, vs. then if I had been depressed or something, and it had been hellishingly long. or if it had been Day 1. Like tomorrow, Oh  crap. DAY 1!!! Hell day!!!! bring it.  lol. delirium....i dreamt about being in mexico, though it was really ugly and old western. i saw juan while i sat on a suburban(?) and asked about omyra. I also thought of some intricate theory and wondered whether to ask my dad to take me to barnes and nobles. scary..my mom said my dad was forcing me to come with him to b&n.  crap. im not listening to a waord aishas saying on the phone. something about tickles. ill just laugh and pretend i get it. *laugh* oh, interesting. brighton made a profile and stuff. its sweet. tho norah jones sucks. 'I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.' nice  what the hell is aisha talking about? alum????? yeah ok. riiight.   that girl who was told by brighton i wanted to kill brighton gave me dirty looks today. her eyes follwoed mine whenvever i passed her and she looked at me like i was a psycho. i sorta smiled at points. but like a baddish smile. i dont know how to say it. like when two people know a secret. wait. not really.  nothing else to say.  much love  peace  ~alex

      ugh. today was so mundane it was gross.  *falls over, sleeping. hits head on pavement and kills self, blood spilling everywhere*  oi. last night wwas good though. i talk to aisha, she told me a few things, but it was only for a few minutews. she said had to say somehting but coul only say it by phone. alrighty.   then i laid on my bed for 20 minutes and listened to 'things ill never say' by avril(folkish avril, not punker) and i thought of aisha. lol...i was content...  but im a total freak. the thought that popped int my head was im so happy i could kill mysle fand all would be good.  what the fuck?????  lol. im guessing most people dont think that. oh well. i remain a weirdo.  ack i keep pulling my shirt off my stomach. i had mnms so i feel fat. yes, i go through like 30 minute stages. but whatever.  in first period i sang 'Why Can't I?' by liz phair to alex stabler, and she cried. the whole double block we sang the song. it was sweet. she found this early on, but i doubt she remembers it. she didnt read it all though, so im fine.  another day of being ignored by brighton, its sorta sad.  i should really go to mr koetke and get math help. but i dont want to. i feel like relaxing. forgetting that anything had ever happened bad. and that i lived in san antonio.  I wrote a poem about aisha the other day. but i dont wanna post it. yeah.  THE SPAIN TRIP IS ONLY ONE WEEK!!!!!! i thought it was two, ALL of spring break, so i thought i couldnt go to mexico. but i might be able to visit omyra. but i shouldnt get my hopes up, or ill feel crappy when i cnt go.  ill have fun with melanie in spain though. i dont think kamryn likes me.  i dont have much else to say. brian boscoe. (thats a note for me)  alrighty....  Much love..  peace  ~alex  la vida es una mentira.

She was talking to someone, then her friend yelled' brighton!' and brighton left. alrighty. it seems that whenver im having a crappy day, she comes along and makes it worse. at least in the days before break and today.  today was shitty. just shitty.  lets see....had english first...that was incredibly boring, but i lived. then biology. i did my extra credit and wanted to turn it all in, but there was a substitute. and i ahd been all happy that i finished a day early!!! now ill have to rush....ack. it has to be in by 12 15 tomorrow.  oh well. holly just asked me to help her with a tech thing. i was lost. lol  brighton returned...*looks around* i should be in math right now, studying. I got a C or D on the last test, really below what ive been getting this quarter, all because i missed 3 problems. ack.  this guy brian went into my locker and stole my gift for yanna. it was like a $5.99 princess kelly doll, but still. coward. you're a damn coward alex. yes. *begins cursing self out* i hope brian goes to hell. lol. he called it a crack barbie!!!! bastard, i dont like him anymore. ill give him dirty looks when isee him next. i even asked him where he got it 'i dont know'. bitch. lol  brighton turned around and looked at me quickly. i hope she comes in. not really, thatd be awkward. but then id start writing nasty things about her and dare her to look. lol..i crack myself up.   hal is playing neopets with a 6th or 7th grader. nice. and he just showed me his origami cup collection. that boy is a little weird. but he's arias friend....  everyone was back again from being sick. nice for them. sarah has lots of tests to make up right after finals. she'll try before but doubt that'll happen.  i had a really weird dream last night. it was a nice dream tho. i cant tall anyone tho, very private stuff. :P  la vida es una mentira. la verdad es falsa. te amo sin razon, y te quiero con amor sorda. its a song. lol. sort of. very singy songy.  rudys is hugging/choking the girl brightons talking to. i hope he falls on her and she falls on brightong and brighton dies.

KHODA! i had no idea. i shitted my way through it. i mean, the things were totally random. i ahd to choose between whether southern writers in the 1920s were really disillusioned with their region or were putting up a 'veneer of disillusionment' (WHAT THE HELL does that mean??!!!) and whether people thought WWI was a good idea...but..um..they DONT TALK ABOUT opinion in the book.  the others ahd an easy essay. it was on sex in the 1920's. yay. who said histyorys not educational.  once again, my theory that EVERYTHING in the world revolves arounds ex was right. in biology, the whole class period, we were talking about sex and animals and crap. what is wrong with us??????????????????????????????????     ummm......did u know that .2 to 2% of people are born 'intersexual', or without a defined gender. it was in 'time'...they ahd these stories and pictures of people born with vaginas and penises(they showed them grown up after removing some of the stuff so they could be one gender or another).....one guy had his rbeasts and vagina removed in the january..he had decided to be a boy in puberty after being a girl til then because he got a low voice and mroe masculine face....EW?   lol..sorry....but i dont think anyone here is inter....cause, well, im the only one reading. i should really call aisha.  brightons mad at me or soemthing. she said 'annoyed'. well im annoyed too. lol  crystal: 'i couldnt find the thing, sorry..' me:'oh its ok, i dotn care about it' 'ok, great! well, i gotta go..' *walks off...* 'bitch'  lol, that was hilarious.....jen was next to me..it was a few days ago tho..  i was sick monday. i forgot to write anything..  i gotta go :(  much love  peace  ~alex  'freshy has a... *giggle*"

I had the weirdest dream ever. I can't talk about it tho... haha...i messed up the spelling there and it said 'tit ho'  ack everything in life revolves around sex. I hate it. I hate life.

      alright.........ill try to do this in the little time i have here..if i dont finish, ill do it later....  WORK!!!! hard but fun stuff...  khoda mane, i cant describe it. I was so scared to death I would sya soemthing wrong. because, see, this sitn like any random translator job. i translated and if is aid somehting wrong, the person could die from the wrong medicine or from wrong diagnosis of a disease. It was a stretch soemtimes, but it was rather easy most of the time. I learned how to do some vitals, but i didnt perform them on anyone alone, i feared i would do them wrong. the one lady i did do it for, i got it exactly right tho.  IT WAS SO SAD! there was this one girl...see, there was this smallish hall where teenage nurses were doing vitals for everyone who came in, and then there was one doctors office and on the other side a few tables where they gave out meds and glasses and stuff. So i was helping anyone who needed a translator, and at one point the indian girl(sabrina?) called me in to the doctors office to translate. i went in..... and there was this girl half crying and her mom. sabrina told me the mom wanted a translator because she didnt speak english, but her daughter did. the doctor was asking her(rather rudely..he didnt have any compassion for her) what hurt and how mcuh and stuff...she was in 7th grade 11 or 12 they said...and so he didnt know i was a translator so i answered a question he gave a nurse there about which organ was where the girl pointed(he knew, he was testing the nurses) and she didnt know..i offered appendix or kidney, it was kidney, so he liekd me. so..umm...  i got a lesson in bio. but the girl said she hadnt eaten in 4 or 5 days, only drank water, and was in a lot of pain. she was taking some meds from honduras. and the doc told the nurses that the meds were horrible for growing people, they turned theiur teeth permanently black..so at this point i stopped him and said this to the woman in spanish...it was horrible having to say this...and soem other stuff..i asked her questions...all the while, he wasnt telling me anything to say, I had to choose what was important or not...GOD HELP ME....so then he said to the girl that he was gonne give her meds and if she didnt feel better in 12 hours, she had to go to the emergency room immediately....aftyer geting chest x-rays.....tiene que...que...llevarla al cuarto de emergencia si ella no sienta mejor en...en..(someone else offers doce..)..doce horas...it was awful saying this. Also that this was SERIOUS, but not a disaster...i remember i repeated that a few times....OH yeah! she had pneumonia...i ahd offered appendicitis because i had hoped for that. well finally the doc turns to ehr and says that she shouldt have waited this long..and that its really serious....  God.....  finally I ask sabrina if she can bring in a native hispanic person to make sure the lady got ALL of what she needed to know.......she explained it quickly again to the lady, then left....so i translated a little more until the lady left...  The rest was much easier and less stressful. i talked to people about how long they waited, what hurt, etc...some people waited 5 hrs, its sad.    on the drive over(my mom let leila drive!) my sis had sort of goten mad at me because..well....for her to get the job she had had to go thru A LOT of stuff, but that since i knew spanish(something she was also bitter about...she doesnt use it enough to be fluent and she forgets a lot...plus, years of talking pidgin with ceci scarred it...) i got thru without problems or applications...they did give me one afterwards, but im too young to legally work there, so if the authroties find out, the lady who gave me the applic will say she didnt see...they needed spanish speakers....  i met a guy named ashkan....half persian, black...i told him ym religious situation..hes the same, excpet bahai-> mormon(fake)....  I skipped studying for 2 tests, an in class essay, and a quiz..lol  ill write more later i think  much love  peace  ~alex

      Today was so weird I can't think.    WHat the hell happened?  I went to history..the test was fine..after all, i was writing stuff for it for 4 hours last night, blowing off every other subject. so i ditched PE, did my math hw there...spanish was fine...then in sex we got int rouble cause we stayed around the class instead of going somehwere else(the comp lab for the librarians speech er soemthing) and then we went after she sent someone and we walekd really slowly so miss allen said shed give us all tardies. ggrreat. then we ran.  that was boring..math was fine..i found out i ddi double as much hw as i shouldve, but its good cause the other stuff is due next class.   this is the part where i get beat up...u can skip it if u dont liek graphic scenes...lol   lunch was fine.until...well, animal rights was ok, but we were kicked out of our room so we went to blaney patio..where lunch time theatre was....it was like 6 people yelling..so the meeting ends....and hal walks over..and me, sara, and sam talk to him....then they leave us and i start walking...hal takes my sweater..i cant remmber why, but we were fooling around...and then i find it again. so we walked back to high school and i pretend to hit him(i miss everytime, purposely) with my sweater...then after the third time, while im jsut laughing, he turns aroudn pissed and tells me to give himt eh sweater and hell make me go find it(he hid it before and then helped me find it) so i said no..i didnt really expect him to be serious...so he grabs it and pushes his fingers his fingers into my neckand pushes me to the ground..i dont let go of it, i like the weater..but im able to like puch him back(it really hurt!) and run to the lock back hall.....so he has his finger sin my neck like half the time until ifall to the floor, still clutching my sweater...then i put my nails into his hand until he lets go, at which point i quickly twist the hand he had on my neck back and he gets a little hurt(dont forget my pain, yeah?) and then i get up and run to where sarah is...i quickly mumble soemthing to her but then he swings this huge, hard lunchbox into my head!  what the fucking hell? how first grade is this???  and sam and sarah are like oh my god, cause that fucking hurt(sorry for the language). and imlike yeah im fine(i blacked out quickly, so i didnt feel it that much) and hes like if sarah wasnt standing there, id hit u again. what the hell?  this boy is messed up!  sarahs like 'my god, hal!' and hes like 'look at my hand!' (i dont cut my nails often, so their often longer than most people and i dug them in a bit while his hand was on my neck, i wanted to get the hand off)  who the hell cares about your hand? aria did when he showed her and explained how i attacked him..lol..  well, anwyays, i run to the library and he stops outside. THANK GOD i had a free period. i stayed there with joe for a while.   it turns out, hal is really agressive. hes been depressed a while because hes had bad grades, and hes really good karate er whatever, so he punched joe last week for no reason(in the eye..thats serious) and has randomly walked up to him and hit him.   so anyways...i get to english(last period..with him uck) early and sit inside with sam o. and talk to her...he walks in and says 'im gonna kick your ass after class'  go to hell, hal.  and i say 'why?? whatd i do?' ' you dug your fingers into my hand'. and what the fucking hell were you doing the whole time??  so i watch the movie and give notes to sarah and joe about it....we rush out afterwards and get out of the main area after i get my books..he took a while to get out..i guess he gave up on the idea.  but joe wanted to go to mr o'brien's office(principal) since hal and punched him, and i siad what the heck. lets go  so sarah leaves once we get to the office and wait til he can take us..and it works out. the minute i walk out, i see my grandma, and leave school to go to her house and study bio. she used to teach it.  END BEAT UP lol  what kind of messed up say is that?  my wrist couldnt fully move and my neck still hurts when u bend it. uck.  anyways..i studied..then came home, talked to ceci about life..  tried to look up one of her old people..the first family that let her work when she first came. couldnt find anything on michael froly/frolley or sally same last name.  too bad.  and i end this sadly  much love  peace  ~alex

      yesterday was different..it ended better then it went.   i talked to brighton during C period...she was sad, i as i guessed..spanish was boring, but sam told me that he wasnt mad i threw a pen at his head. lol  i accidentily used something i shouldnt learn until for a year. at least no one heard  after school yanna asked me if i would go to ring dance with her friend, and sheba asked me to ask kimberly then lindsey. kimberly probably still doesnt like me, so no. lindsey- i shouldnt go just cause sheba wants me to make her feel good(its $70!!) and i asked yanna to bring a picture of her friend. lol...  i wore like semi-cultural today. but when i went to the breezeway for a second, everyone looked at me like i was a freak, so ill keep my jacket on longer. im taking an american passeporte picture with a shirt that says 'iran' on it. lol....  oh yeah, im in tech double block first period, but we have a break...  last night i really wanted to hug brighton. i dont know why, except for the fact that i was depressed and wished it could be all better.   its odd, ive never hugged her. oh well  life sucks  i finished my book yesterday. its always terribly depressing, even tho ive read it a few times before. nuha ends it with such sadness that it makes me depressed. oh well...  then i listened to 'numb' by linkin park right before i slept, and i slept well.   havent talked to aisha since saturday or sunday.  gtg  much love  peace  ~alex

      once again..dont feel like writing........................  i forgot earlier. on tuesday, since no one was responding to the things jen was talking about, i loudly said 'she has a lot of drugs' and half the class turned around. wow. nice reaction.   hum.......after school on wednesday jen cut me. it was a really interesting sensation. she started slow..and then..grabbing my arm...she went faster, and faster and it started really bleeding...and then i stopped. i was sort of sared i guess. i dont know.  during a free earlier that day i had talked to brighton and she had said she was scared because of what i was doing and that she ahd done all of it before, it wasnt worth it. 2 problems with that:  1. she has a serious credibility problem. she smokes. 2. she has a large group of friends she cans surround herself with, so she really couldnt have gone thru this or whatever. also, when i asked her to name poeple who cared for me, she could only name 2. one was herself.  hum  i had to cover up the scars at work tho. and my new uniform was short sleeved, so i was really afraid something would go wrong....but it was fine. at the end one of the doctors gave a quick talk about taking it totally serious and not to do stupid things like take drugs and not associate with people who do.  hum.  i dont know if im gonna go with jen when she goes to drug herself. her friend whos giving her the pills ODed last night on over the counter pain pills.  hum  saturday night my little cousin is sleeping over. his parents are going to get divicred in a little. its so sad.  hum.  i dont know what I'll do on staurday day. I wanna go to a huge protest in LA, but i dont know if I can. I might see a movie tonight. depdnds on how much homework i ahve. im getting used to staying up later. every morning I wake up at like 6 and then drift in and out. its much better than just being forcced to get up immediately. and im sleeping later.  hum  jen couldnt cut me today. she had to talk to mr. mclaughlin about a late lab. next time she has to cut me above the elbow. so no one can see. spain in one week!  hum.  life is tiring. at lunch i helped jen with some stuff. sat with her and andrea for a while. then this annoying boy came. so many annoying people today. him, sheva, um...im sure i had more before..oh well.  hum  OH yeah!! a huge truck filled with gas fell over on the freeway and killed some poeple, gas everywhere, im sure explosions. mass traffic jams. everyone was diverted off the freeways to small side roads. thousand sof people. i wa slucky cause i knew the areas around and the secret roads, but people like neena were 3 hours late. she drove in a carpool from 6 45 to 10 45. My God.   talking to adrienne..she gave up this morning and just went home..nice.  i should go....im alone with ms allen..scary..lol  much love  peace  ~alex

      ahh...finally time..when i dont feel like writing..............................  friday sucked. it made me feel crappy. hm......math was fine...free was fine..........english, boring as always......lunch was ok..............  allie wasnt there so i was happy. but sable followed me...so after she left, everyone tried to figure out who had brought sable.,..so i was voted out..lol...but than sheba made it serious. nice.  jennas a fucking bitch. whore. lol  it was fine..i didnt care. but then...see...i was gonna let jennifer cut me with her pin....so we were walking into bio and sarah was putting her stuff next to my seat(as always). jen ran to her and begged her to leave cause she wanted to sit next to me. sarah said ok....so jen sat next to me. immediately mr mclaughlin said ok im gonna put you guys into pairs...screw the cutting idea. so...lucky us...me and sarah get paired up..so we're doing this random, repetitive assignment and talking..shes being bossy and controlling.  she had gotten more like that ebcause jenna didnt talk for herself and was sarahs lackie. sarah decided she and sam werent really friends anymore because she had jenna today i think. how nice of her.   so..shes like... 'why did jen wanna sit next to you?'  we had to talk...  'no you didnt'  uh yeah we did.... 'come on freshy. no one really lieks you. they just use you.'  i dont remember what happened after that. but i just remember being pissed at her.  thats what making me go over the edge. supposedly im her best friend(well, ahvent shceked since jenna came) and look at all the shit im taking. samanthas the only one who actually seems to care how shitty i feel. ack. i hate my life  over the weekend...since jen didnt get to cutting me after school.... i cut myself 11 times....it was actually nice. it stung..but..it was an interesting sensation. i like it. but i have to wear long sleeves from now on....hm...  weekend..was ok..nothing at all interesting. i should call ceci today tho. but i have a bunch of homework since i have work wednesday night. and a history midterm tomorrow.  monday...today..my best day. i woke up at a good time....its my dogs birthday. we're going to petsmart. lol  free double..stayed with melanie most of it...did random things. i called her fat and stupid tho. sort of. lol  spanish.....brightons getting surgery on he rnose and chin fat friday.   "lifestyles..of the rich and the famous............................................"   ahha...some people think im poor tho..lol....cause everyones like 'i got a laptop for my birthday! 'i got an ipod!'...i got a shirt? hah...and Cds and books. thats good tho. i like Cds. and i ahve a laptop.   melanie told me how to get internet on my laptop. yay.  spanish....ummm.....  i talked to jennifer most of the time. she hasnt eaten since last tuesday. her nails had gotten blue and her hands were freezing. we talked about drugs too. shes gonna get high on speed friday after school at the movies, so she invited me to go. i doubt ill do anything tho. im scared of drugs. nice....  she said she wanted to overdose. i hope not. she has to go to woodland hilsl tho cause her drug dealer friend is there. i dont know if ill really go. ill see.  'if u looked in my eyes, would u see whats inside, would u even care?'  thats a really good line. its from a song im hearing right now. 'dreaming of you ' by selena..hah its so aisha.  i talked to her sunday night. her mom told her she was too naive to go to public school. hah yeah. but she puts up a facade. shes not as naive as everyone thinks. sometimes. except when matt talks about bjs. lol  im sitting in the comp lab alone...  brighton was annoyed at me today or soemthing. she ignored me a lot. who knows. in math we had a substitute....talked a lot. shaidas bitchy. she doesnt like me anymore. its funny...  i need to go..mom shoudl be here soon...                .................i suddenly feel guilty...who knows  much love  peace  ~alejo

      i forgot to write about some stuff.....i dont care about some of them tho.  but iw anted to write down my dream. the night before last...i dreamt that me and jennifer were walking in the neighborhood where my grandmother lives, and we were trying to get back to her house. but we were on a different street....a row of houses in front of us were blocking her house. so w were looking for a path thru someones garden or something.  we looked..and walked..and reached the end of the street. we saw a house with a long driveway... we started going into it so we could get home, but then this guy came out with a big gun, and we got scared. we ducked behind a car...but he walked towards the car so i jumped down this big grassy hill and reached the bottom just as the guy reached jennifer, who was still crouching. he fired a few shots into her face... i was scared...i dont remember what happened after that.  but then me and jennifer were on trial or something, and the guy with the gunw as there. i dont remember it well, but it seemed horribly depressing and i felt like that too. well, jennifer was on a computer..looking at random things...cause i think the trial had just ended and there was a computer in the room. a guy in black stood over her shoulder, looking at the computer. he was her friend.  i dont remember anymore.  i had a dream last night..but id rather not share. ill post it somewhere else i guess.

      hm, brighton's had sex. i believe thats me and aisha's clue.  *drives over to her house* 'hey aisha, wanna have sex?' 'uhh, i dont know, my moms here and plus i like MATT.' 'tell ur mom the grocery store is selling pills thatll make her forget about joe or steve or that guy. she'll run. and this is just casual. matt won't care.' 'alright!'  massive terrorist bombings in spain. its really sad. somehting like 200 people dead, 1000 injured. not sure if its ETA or al qaeda. hm..  which means mr rosenbaum has like...hes not sure whether we're not going to spain. sissies. everyone here is a coward. they yell at everyone who does things and calls them cowards, like the people who blow themselves up, but i dont get it. wouldnt you all die for your country? how is that cowardly? i dont know...  after school i taked to luis for first time. he seems nice. aida too. but i ahd to stay til 3 40 and ms allen cut off the power at 3 15. nice.  luis knows melanie's person, leticia. he scared me with his description at first, 'ugly..short..smelly" but then he said he was kidding. so alright then. he never answered. i decided to go to a university and get him a sweatshirt. chocolate or something for his family. aida said to get him 'large'. hm.   we talked about everything. tomorrow we'll do the same. they learn us history in 1o secundaria..our 10th grade....i think its...i dont know. i just dont like it. i cant explain why not. im weird.  so yeah, last ngiht it alked to brighton and she said she didnt know why sex was such a big deal..the first time is special, but its not big after that. AHH. who knew. she seems so innocent. sort of. i just didnt think that. hm...i asked her who and she said it was personal. i dont think its DJ. lol  sat with samantha at lunch. it was nice. sarah and her lackie and lindsey had all eaten, so they studied. im sort of mad at sarah. she's controlling. thats why she likes jenna. she doesnt talk or say what she thinks. me and samantha talked about her. and about sable. and everything. and yet nothing at the same time. it was so hot.   i downloaded a good song by molotov. 'gimme the power'. aida recommended it.   oh..i was gonna write it up there..but i was too lazy.. after the part about brighton. from an lfo song. my favorite song on the CD.   'my little peace of heaven has a secret she won't tell.'   lol..it sounds silly in retrospect. the song is about this guy who makes this chcik whos crying happy...and then she goes back to the guy that made her cry. i can relate to that. sadly...lol..sort of. and in relation to people you dont know.....*looks away*  Going under.....by evanescence.....AHHHHHH FUCKING AWESOME. i love evanescence. i should really get that CD. i need it.its my blood.    i promised jennifer she could cut me tomorrow. we ditched spanish quickly to do it, but i didnt wanna get AIDS from her bloody knife so shes bringing a safety pin tomorrow. dont worrry, im not psycho. id rather she cut me than herself. and so it goes. whatever it takes i guess. dont try to figure out what that means....well. try. u wont succeed. it has nothing to do with cutting or helping jennifer. it has to do with how pathetic i am. lol  i dont want to stop writing... i want to wake up and be alone..yet..with someone. aisha. that sounds good. wake up with aisha. and its raining..a steady stream..the clouds are making it dark..and i hug aisha. forever.   The memories are fading  My posters are falling down  I try to hold on  But I just wanna let go  Am I just being selfish,  For wanting it to end?  Am I just screaming for attention?  Nobody will ever know  Because nobody will ever ask  They can't hear my screams of pain  Or the lonely whisper of my soul  They choose to ignore the signs  And so I'll slice my wrists  Nobody will ever know  Because nobody will ever see  Because there is nobody out there  That truly sees me  thats not by me..but i like it..because it is me. well..aisha sees me i guess.   khoda. i hate writing 'lol'. im starting to write it after everythign serious to sort of make my emotions seem lighter. its getting annoying. and i cant stop myself. i cant stop anything. im worthless. and weak.  uh oh.   [09:17 PM]:  ally...remember how u said u would answer ANYTHING that i asked u...? nothing good can come after that. (the convo...i asked her whats going on with ehr and dj earlier..read her lj and it inferred them going out..i didnt know that! so i asked her..im not sure shes shocked i didnt know or what..)  [09:18 PM]:  i know u don't like any1 at our school, but lets u had to chose some1...who would that be? hmm...   lol, whered u get this question?  BSmile88 [09:19 PM]:  from my head??   alright...lemme think  BSmile88 [09:19 PM]:  ok u do that.  i'll be waiting.  BSmile88 [09:19 PM]:  lol  umm   well..someone to like....or someone to like me   both    i dont know...maybe rina     or jennifer  i dont know  BSmile88 [09:20 PM]:  ha ha ha   i dont think about these things ]:  What??  BSmile88 [09:20 PM]:  what about aria?  BSmile88 [09:20 PM]:  rina...ur attracted to rina?   whered u get her???   no!   i said if!  ...etc.  thats interesting.  I DIDNT RIGHTA BOUT Monday in here!!!!!  jennifer wrote on my back during spanish class. all my back...we ahd a substitute who read a book while we watched a movie, he didnt notice. she wrote a dating personal..weird.... forgot first part but ended 'seeks big woman'..some of my fetishes included: small asian children, bald russian men, other stuff..and in Big word, "BRIGHTON!"....sloane suggested it.  lol  this is getting long...and ims ure ill rmemeber soemthing i should have written later.  until then  much love  peace  ~alex  'let what may come, come. Death is upon me, and I am ready. I think.'

      AHHHHHH i dont have any time to write anymore.  Today was the most fucked day ever. It was soooo weird. everything kept changing...  I wake up mad, because i wanted to sleep in(double free) but i was forced up..........i go to school.......i spent the first 20 mins of free talking to brighton...she started to smoke and all her friends now want to. So she gets mad at DJ for smoking, then turns around and smokes. niiiice.  i want to start smoking. It helpes relive stress i heard? I wont gett adicted err whatever though.   I had spanish then......long quiz......then some other crap...we got let out 20 mins early....so me and jen hung out.......she wrote "M O R       N" on this girl krys(who she hates and thinks is a total idiot) 's locker except upside down, so i bet her that when krys came she would think it said 'norm'...she came and said "who wrote norm on my locker???" lol..what an ididot. I also talked to her about stabler. she had bad feelings for her. me and jen beat eachother up in the middle of spanish. fun.   then i had human development...presentations about DRUGS! great fun! ya hear that bright-lite?(lol)   then lunch...sarah said she was gon' to sit with allie up there *points* and..well..ive sat with them and the others there a few times, and im fine with all of them, but allie's a bitch(and lesbian! inside joke lol) and i dont like her cause she doesnt like me.   so i really had no one to sit with or nothing to do (sam o. was gone sick) so yes..i wandered for a while and then decided to do drugs in bathroom, so i went there and got high on caffeine. merry old time. so i finished that like 10 mins later.  Then i walk out....walk to big tree withbenches under it....and sit with rina and sam o(she came to school) and christel........ rina put her legs on mine.....she flirted. lol....she jumped on me as were walking somewhere...cause..all there conversaitions have something to do with sex. yanna and christine k came later..... so that was good.  in human dev, while i agve my presentation, rina kept looking at me and giggling. connect the dots?  no.....  i took a quiz the other dya and it said i ws the kind of sexy that didnt know it and that my not acknowledging my own equipment or whatever(it was for girls- they dont mean my penis lol) and that my shyness could turn some people off. thats great.  talked to adrienne some..not much...i left school early cause free last period...  math was depressing at first. i realized i ahd a C+ because i ahdnt turned some things in and my last quiz was 7/20. i was getting a B before that. and i couldnt find my backpack. so i ahd nothing. but than i got it all in class and it was funnyish and then i threw things at sarah through the door behind me..it turned out rather good.   i wrote a really depressing poem. sort of. more like thoughts jotted down.  All is lost... Let me die with this cry,  Let me die wtih this tear...  I have fallen victim to my own curse it seems... Let me surrender my soul, Let the shot kill me now...  Alne I ate, Alone I drank, Alone I smoke, ALone I coughed, Blood around me...  Alone I took the knife and dove it deep...  My stress is gone...  What a relief...Peace be mine. Don't ever leave me,  God, my love, I've missed you so.  Free from anxiety, from fear, from everything.  Liberated.  Protect me now...Let me never fall.  Cover my body, naked, falling, so alone.  With this I must perish, with this my meaningless existence falls.  Surrender my soul, Let my mind die fucked by the bullet...  nice.  aisha cried this afternoon because she might move back to brownville next year. and her dogs still in hospital about to die. and her stepdad has been gone for 2 weeks.  it cheered her up to read it.

      Ma coeur es malade por contentement.  My heart is sick for happiness  Hm, what I remember from french. I remember other phrases, but that seems most relevant now. Life is so sucky.  I remember that epidose of Lizzie mcguire....where she becomes friends with her mom and her mom tells her all these htings like tax problems and her grandma wanting a divorce, and lizzie is all like 'oh no i cant take it'. i thought it was moronic, and she immature. but i sort of get her now...lol  lets look at everything now. well, one day ur like 'yeah, my familys like PERFECT, and my aprents friends and stuff are all rich and happy.' hm. quick look at what the truth is. My grandma had a drinking problem throughout my moms childhood, and ten years ago started AA. she is afraid she'll go back, and so is still in it. This drinking problem stems from her inability to face problems, which help lead to the fact that her 2nd daughter has had 2 divorces(maybe 3?) and her 3rd daughter has an infant and is married to a convict in jail. nice.  And darian's parents....they might divorce. sicne julyish theyve sort of been on the brink of it. they have different personalities, but theyve gotten through like 9 years already.........whats 40 more? and darians so young.......some of it is because annie misses her  home.....fucking diaspora(dispersing)...thats why she went to Iran with daria only in december.....i really hope nothing happens bad with majic and her...  i have big test wednesday, DBQ wednesday, work that night, and big english essay thursday......:(  and to top it all off, havent talked to brighton in a while...at least had a meaningful conversation. and brighton is sorely depressed. she was dizzy when i saw her. God spares no one it seems. dios nos ayude.  other languages always sound so beautiful. thats why i love them....you're in your own world that only those u want can understand you in. its like why i like movies...escape from reality and the hell that surrounds us.  OK...what else i hate: diaspora, laws that allow divorce(lol),  DBQ's, depression, deadlines, war, hatred, anger, violence.  ceci left for LA today..she leaves tomorrow night at 1 in the morning for san salvador...im sad abotut hat.....i really hope nothing happens to her..i have fear...  i gotta go...people milling about...  i wish i could write forever...and forget about life.....write about everythign and nothing....  much love  peace for the stricken  ~alex

      im gonna miss jen next year. it'll suck so bad alone. I seriously need to become friends with kaitlyn(the goth) before they leave. Otherwise I'll be alone.  I'm so pathetic.  I hate myself.

      old poem..jan 27..  Alone and Dead (i hate the title)  All is lost... Let me die with this cry,  Let me die wtih this tear...  I have fallen victim to my own curse it seems... Let me surrender my soul, Let the shot kill me now...  Alne I ate, Alone I drank, Alone I smoke, ALone I coughed, Blood around me...  Alone I took the knife and dove it deep...  My stress is gone...  What a relief...Peace be mine. Don't ever leave me,  God, my love, I've missed you so.  Free from anxiety, from fear, from everything.  Liberated.  Protect me now...Let me never fall.  Cover my body, naked, falling, so alone.  With this I must perish, with this my meaningless existence falls.  Surrender my soul, Let my mind die fucked by the bullet...

      my beloved whitney writes...     Death's Kiss (#1)  2/4/2004      I spent all day contemplating my life. During fourth period, I sat with Gumby but I was practically mute with depression. An hour and a half she talked and I half listened while thinking of how I wanted to do it. Upon all the cues that called for input I would throw short sentences at her, or questions that I knew would require a detailed answer on her part so that I would not have to speak again soon. From about 1 pm until 4 pm I spent my time at school planning.     I am going to wear my black dress. The one everyone tells me I look like a doll in. The black dress that once made me look awfully thin and graceful. The one with the pink at the bottom is the one I will wear.  I will put hot water in the bathtub. I will sit down in the tub. I will press the razor blade deep into my flesh, deeper than I have ever cut. I will draw that blade up my arm. Then, I will do the same to my other wrist. I will lay down in the hot water of my bathtub, in my gorgeous black, designer dress and wait until I am gone.     That was to take place after school. My mother would be watching TV in the living room and typing away at her computer. My father would be working. My brother would be studying or getting drunk. I would be dying in the bathtub all dressed up  I got to my front door. My mind was numb along with my fingertips. I got inside. My mom was there and she asked, Ready to go to therapy? I had completely forgotten about that! Oh, I did not want to go at all. I would have to drag myself through therapy. I got online. I guess I was in search of a goodbye. It felt as though I was just doing things, not thinking. I was not even able to find motivations for my actions. A bit after 4:35 pm we left to see Dana.      The last thing I need is to talk about my problems and get all emotional in front of people. I do not want to have to say fine when she asks me how I am. I do not want to have to lie. I do not want to have to tell Dana why I am NOT fine when I answer depressed. I do not want questioning. I do not want to the telling that I am irrational or in a state of depression that will soon pass if it is worked on. I just want to escape and sleep. Leave me alone.     The car ride was a mess of tear triggers and soft, broken singing. My mom tried to talk to me but I wanted to listen to the music and think. I noticed my legs being tense. I tried to relax. Minutes later, I found them in the previous condition again: tight and tense. I began crying for no reason. I was on edge. I needed to go back home. I needed to do what I had planned. I wiped away my silent, unforgiving tears and got out of the car when we arrived. We went inside and Dana popped out from her office, Im running late. Im sorry 10 minutes? Just want I need, to be stuck here forever. I was bitter and angry but inside I was deeply in sorrow. Dana called my mom in 10 minutes later and asked me to wait for a bit. I cant come? I asked anxiously. She told me she would like to check in with my mom for a little just to see my moms opinion on my therapy. I sat alone. I began to cry again. Twenty minutes later, my mom came back and I wandered reluctantly into Danas office.     Kissing Death (#2)  2/4/2004      She said, How are you?  Fine, thanks. You?  Good. Your mom said you seemed upset on the way over.  Oh?  Yes. Was it over the test you took today?  Maybe. I think I failed.  Why would you think that? Did you study? Thats just it. I studied my ass off. I worked so bloody hard and I still didnt succeed. It isnt supposed to work like that.  Sometimes things do. Im very sorry it happened that way, but why do you think you failed?     We continued to talk. Eventually we started to talk about something that actually interested me. I got very passionate about what we were discussing. She even challenged me with new ideas. I began to think: Dana is a smart person. She has made me think about many things I never considered. I started to forget about my sadness, depression, and anger. As we finished talking, she laughed and said, I like you. You have a lot of strongly represented arguments and thoughts. You are so logical and informed. It is nice to see a young person who seeks information under stress and confusion rather than drugs. A conversation with you is like having a ride on a shooting star. You made me learn a lot today, Whitney. I was so flattered. Someone appreciated me. Someone took the time to listen to me. I was strangely satisfied. I had an urge to go off and meet tons of new people I wanted to seek out new opinions and find a new fascination.      On the car ride home I thought to myself, Im okay.  I could not make sense of what caused the sudden feeling of content that came with the love I felt like I had received. How did a conversation about something I took deep interest in make me want to continue? Utter confusion. Yet, it worked. I had a need to fulfill before I could give up and rest.     I do not know if it is temporary satisfaction. I do not know when my suicidal depression will return, but I think that for now at least, I am going to be able to enjoy life a bit more. I write this entry as a reminder of the past. As a reminder of the little things that people can do to give someone a little hope. As a reminder of the idea that things can get better. As an entry of desperation overcome.      Thus, I sign this entry with a kiss.  *kiss*

      Mikes number...805 777 7072  have to remember that for tomorrow.   The list of illegal things I did in Spain: 1. Bought an illegal CD from a chinese lady in pen'iscola. 2. Wrote graffiti on a wall in pen'iscola. "FUCK" and the word "no" next to a thing that said "moros no" 3. Jaywalked in Madrid. 4. I went to an over 16 pub in Valencia. 5. Ditched the group at the Prado with brittany and christine and went to the market and museo reina sofia. I had a list before in my head..i think i forgot one.  im worried about aps and finals.  i only have 2 serious finals tho in that week. english is may 4, and no history final. so i have bio and math(spanish doesnt count) that week. thats easy. i think im prepared for ap history exam, even tho i didnt study. I seem to know a lot of it.  The year went by so quickly.  I gave Becky a really pretty bracelet. It was supposed to be a gift for Brighton but she pissed me off unintentionally on her part. Supposedly becky really liked it, because aria asked her about it and she said alex shams gave it to her and she got worried when aria pretended to drop into the water. she yelled no. its turquoise and goldish colored.  bio test monday.  the pictures of the guy stefan went after, which she really wanted to see, werent developed when my mom came. she brought other pictures tho.   ive taken a lot of random tests tonight. ill die april 17, 2063. ill sleep with 2 people, and ill love one.  me and aisha switched sex testts, i e we took them for eachother. lol   ive been bothering mikes .....relation.... cindy tonight. i asked her to have sex with me and she freaked out. what....prudes? i guess. theyre so scared of every little thing. lol. stranger sex all the way. ;)    i like black. its pretty.  gonna look for more personality tests. its late.   much love  peace  ~alex

        LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy. PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it. You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz.

      ahhhhhhhhhhhh finalyl time. well, actually, all weekend i did nothing. fun. and adam kept saying we'd go out and then got sick or some thing came up so i didnt really get out or anything. at church i learned that katie had a crush on me for a long time. well, from how emily described it, an obssession. emily told my sister on sat during a car wash about it. and she told me. thank god for emilys big mouth.   well that made me happy. except the obssession ended about 2 months ago when i stopped going to church..........humph. then she got a boyfriend. but emily said that katie would talk about me all the time. yay me! maybe ill go to church more often to see katie or something. lol   lunch was fun. i sat with andrea.....and others. was good. and yearbook notes were good. things have been good today.  but in math shannon, jason, and mandy were all bitchy and yelling and all mad. i told shannon to calm down and she got pissed at me too. but thats ok. everything else was fine. yes.   i keep forgetting peoples names today. like when i forgot jessie's. but now like everyone. like...umm...MOLLY!~ i just got it. was thinking emily for some reason. she told me to call her over summer to hang out. that was sweet.       in library...............................................ill go on aol or soemthing.   oh yeah~! i realized that sam liked me for awhile and people had teased her about it. I had absolutely no idea. i liked molly at that time. when i told molly this the other day she told me about sam. who knew. and aria knew too because long ago she made a comment that i didnt get but now i understand. i think. yes.   what color will i die my hair today? not sure. ill hope i can actually go tho.          bad grade on spanish test came out of nowhere. i wouldve doen fine if i had read directions on one part. it might scare me into studying for final. but i doubt it. ill probably like barely look over stuff. god im so lazy.    trying a diet the month of june starting now. ive sucked so far. what ive eaten today:  -3 walnut chocolate chip cookies.  -half a sandwich -like 4 cherries -3 small cookies -juice -chocolate milk -a small circular sausage thing -tabasco cheezits  AHH FAT     lol   much love  peace  ~alex

      My Spiritual AUto-Biography   (hah so fake) lol  Screaming Tears  Until the age of 13, I lived a relatively happy life, enjoying everything around me and delighting in the immenseness of the world in which I lived. Often I went on walks with my friends and played games in the park. I read books for hours on end and would run outside to throw around a ball whenever I could. Every summer my family and me went on long trips to Europe or Mexico, and often we would visit my family in Iran. We went to the beach and to the old palaces, rejoicing in the vastness of the beautiful Caspian and the grandeur of the imperial residences. I played with my cousins and would always returned home joyful. My life seemed perfect, like a dream. Yet for every dream, there is an accompanying nightmare, and mine would happen much sooner than I could have thought.  One day my best friend Akbar was shot in the chest as he walked along a South LA street. That day, my life changed forever. The world became morbid and bitter; everything was dark and ruined for me. I sat for hours in silence, thinking about what was left around me. I remember, a few days after his death, a friend of my father’s was deported for little reason, something that would not have mattered if he had been, say, from Britain. The lack of justice shocked me. The world seemed hopeless. We were living on borrowed time. I remember on one of my trips to Tehran, I was walking along a small street while my cousin Morvarid rode her bike up and down. I saw something moving around at the end of the street and ran towards it. When I got there, I realized it was a small mouse caught in a trap. It squirmed and cried out to me for help, but all I could do was watch in silence. It slowly died, absorbing all the pain possible from the cruel wooden death cell. I stood there stunned for a few minutes to grasp what had happened before me. Years later, after my best friend’s death, this is what I would feel like: a mouse trapped with no escape, dieing from torture for a reason I did not understand.  For two weeks or so all I could do was sit around. I have little memory of this painful time, but I remember that everyone around me tried to cheer me up to no avail. I was lost to the world. Darkness encompassed my being, and there was no light left for me to find.  I was completely and utterly alone.   Some three weeks after Akbar’s death we decided to go to my friend’s house in the countryside around La Paz, El Salvador. The plane ride seemed interminable to everyone around me, but to me, time was no object. I had sat around in the house for hours before, how was a plane any different? We arrived in San Salvador at around 5:00 and from the airport we took an old bus through the mountains and countryside to La Paz. The darkness was lifted at around six or so, but traffic kept us going until thirteen o’clock and some. The old, bumpy mountains had tired me and made my thigh numb; I was very relieved to arrive. For two weeks we stayed there, walking to the beach and having picnics in the beautiful grass fields around Ceci’s village. We walked around the town, reconnecting with friends from our previous visits. I remained distant throughout the trip, and it was not until the last day that I began talking to our old friends. That night was a Friday; I stayed awake until 5 or so in the morning talking to one of my friends, Karmen. We talked about how things had been and what we hoped for the future and everything. I was happy that night, for the first time in over a month. When morning came, my parents came and told me it was time to go. I cried and yelled so violently that they backed off and said they would come to me in an hour. I immediately knew that now was the time to avoid my certain fate. I ran to Karmen’s house, a small cottage on a hill surrounded by grass and flowers, and started knocking loudly. She came to the door and I quickly explained to her what I desired- relief from the Samsara my life had become in Los Angeles. She turned and told her mother she’d be back later before walking out of her house and running to a nearby hill overlooking the ocean. We sat there for a few minutes until she told me it was time to go. We then walked down to the shore and started walking north westish; she joked that it would only take a few weeks to walk me home. Around noon we walked into a nearby village called Zacalouteca and went to a small café in someone’s front yard. We ate there and sat for a few hours, talking about what we would do when we returned to Yanetzal, our village. Around fifteen o’clock we went to sleep on a patch of thick grass in a corner of the town. I slept for three hours before she woke me up; “¡Ya está noche, regresamos!” “It’s late, we have to get home.” I agreed, and we began walking back. We returned a few hours later, after sunset, and we went to our own houses and fell asleep. I would stay there for one week more before finally coming back to Los Angeles.  I had been awoken from my sleep, and both my dream and my painful nightmare were over. I was numb.  School started again a week after we got back. I do not remember that first quarter, those first few weeks, and I assume they had no impact on me. Yet the worst was over. And my life had begun again. Things were different, changed. I was changed. The naïve, innocent boy of childhood was gone, and I was replaced. I was changed, yet for the better or worse I am still not sure.     I dont know how to end it. and it was in nice font. Bellgothic bt.   im in class so now i gotta go.   MUCH LOVE  peace  ~alex

      jen and andrea left me an unusually cruel note in my locker. i mean..i know it was jokingly...but it seemed so mean....tasteless... god.  and i showed rina..afterwards she was like 'and these are the people you choose to hang out with?'  i hung my head.....      ill type it here i guess. even tho it shows me as pathetic.   "  HI MY NAME IS ALEX...  I smoke!...one puff I drink!...not even a sip!   AND I PIERCE MYSELF...only half-way- and I screamed like a womanly little boy, and actually jen did it...im too much of a pussie to do it myself.  ...and I flail my hands in the air at the taste of vodka, and act drunk after one sip.  Also...I"M THIRTEEN  EEW  "   I laughed the first time i read it..and I still sort of laugh..but at the same time......  I think no. I dont need this. But...it doesnt matter anymore. theyll be gone in one week. one hellish stressful week.        rinas mad at me....i, in turn, want her. I want her badly. i think about just randomly kissing her when we're joking about flirting....always thinking about her....... i wrote in my lj about her without using her name..look:  "And I want to be with you. I want to sit in a little forest and watch river go by for hours...to just think...to be silent with you...just to hold you there, to have you there....for you to love me......for you to keep me.........   and i know u really care...but i cant break off. I cant do it. im too weak. I feel so guilty, and so depressed, and yet so....excited when im there. take me away?   Please kidnap me  amount negotiable(taken from aisha)"  the rest is incredibly depressing. i hope it scares school people. the background is also real depressing. haha. id rather explain whats wrong here than there.   :)     this week is so stressful. a test on friday that even AMANDA isnt ready for(in math) and a bio quiz that day too... im looking forward to making up english story tomorrow. i love the feeling of making up this other life, this other identity. one that gives me reason for sadness. i read the story and it makes me shiver. i want to write part time or something when im older.    waiting for aisha to come back   much LOVE  peace  ~alex

      back home...forgot about some stuff. jen found out i was 13, 14 in a week. andrea wouldnt elave me alone about it, cause she hates people 7 - 13 . lol  i decided i would just pretend i had turned 15 instead of 14. it'll work. it was a good day tho. they asked these 7th graders how old they were and they said 13 and they laughed.   i found a new obsession. her name is *looks at arm* taylor mednick. shes 13. which means shes a 7th grader. lol. but its ok. an 11th grader, gabe, asked alex pines out at the assembly. it was a fun assembly. talent show.  she looks like aida from the spain trip sort of. except not spanish. and this girl could sing. she sang sarah mclachlan in front of the whole school.   aisha thinks i like kay tho. i was just..um..interested, in how different the two of them seemed. men in black eyeliner? that didnt seem very ish. but ok.    talked to danielle after school...and in bio..we ditched it to watch some of the middle school assembly. but it was crappy. so ok.     yeah....combine this with the last entry. yes  im gonna ask my sister to get me a cap gun for my birthday.  i always wanted one. lol  much love  peace  ~alex

On friday i brought a razor to school for andrea to cut 'hallice' into my hair, but i didnt see here most of the day (i ate lunch with gal only). we got out of bio early, cause we had tot ake a standardized test with a substitute, and so we sat in a hallway and she cut a bald spot, a happy face, and a band around my leg. nice. after shcool, i stayed til 4 with tutor. then i sat with jen for 20 mins (she was there to watch a game at 6) and took two of her pills. they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!! on tuesday, after my english final, im taking 3 no doubt. ill see if that does anything to make me happy.   yeah.  my mom found my writing on the wall. she said 'os writing on your wall your new thing?"  i guess.  "well i dont think you should do it."  why not? its not like all over the room.  "oh, youre not gonna cover your walls with it?"  no.  "ok"...she was fine with it ig uess. but she checks what i write. i wrote 'my fan doesnt match' and she started tlaking to me about it later. i got a fan. its metallic with a blue neon light. the first night i put it on and read under it, and i was afraid id have dreams about aliens. but its cool..   i burned part of my carpet with incense on like wednesday. that was fun. it wasnt on purpose tho...lol   no, im not that cool. but i did check out jens bong. at church ill see if i can ask adrienner for some of her mj to put it in. mjs better than speed...  yes. lol. not that i would know.

      ve been really suicidal and depressed but im better now i guess. rather not bore you with my thoughts.  my parents searched my room and found a marijuana lighter. i cant belive they havent said naything. it scares me and make sme miserable that they ignore it. hellishly miserable  i deleted some fotos fromt exas trip just to erase anything incriminating. mike took too many movies of peoples asses.  ack.  we saw a movie today. dodgeball..then we walked around and looked for a fone while a blond, retarded looking guy checked him out. *sticks finger in mouth*  aisha is having friend problems or something. cause go dforbid she not have 10 people to sit around at lunch with. it almsot annoys me but i find it mroe funny nowadays that things are better. not that u can read this to care.   whitney told me an oral sex experience she had with pat. it just finished after...*checks* like an hour and a half. doubt i should really talk about it. lol   yeah.  i wnated to go to olvera street with shirley and some other people but i have damn doctors appointment. ugh. finally somewhere to go out and do soemthing and i have a stupid phsyical.   next time. ill call her some day to go do soemthing. but im not sure how to read her... i gave hints at doing osmehting else but she ignored the fatc that i made sure she realized i had a week before i ahd to leave. not 2 days or somehting. a whoooole week. stupid peruvians. lol j/k   umm so yeah..nothing itneresting here.  oh i was gonna call molly but shes gone somehwere. when i pressed mandy for information she asked if i like dher and  i said no. the conversation had to end at that point.   my boring life continues.  during the texas trip i was hoping a car would come and slam into my side and id die. lol .  pathetic. but as they said on nip/tuck 'suicide takes sle festeem and courage'  none of which i have. so hm.  oh and the reaosn id dint see aisha was becuase gma decided that no we didnt need to leave a day early to see her. so um we stayed at home while it rained and all the cosuins went out to see thewir father. we played on my computer all day. yes, a MUCH better use of time. ugh.    part of me and whits convo: ink that lyes: how does a guy get blue-balls? ARSPICKLES: what kind of blue?? ink that lyes: i dont know ink that lyes: Pat just said that at KFMA Day I gave him blueballs ink that lyes: and i wondered what he meant ink that lyes: lol ARSPICKLES: did u suck it too hard or somehting?????

      my journal..i made things smaller. i dont like it. i want to totally get new layout, but it would take too much time, eh  maybe in the 3 days i have when i get back from here.   "The world spins and people keep crying.  A shepherd screams and the world ignores.  A mother's body is stepped upon; the newspapers are not noted.  And Sarajevo cries. Treblinka has come to the 90's."  no idea where that came from. read entry below for real uupdates  peace  so much love  alex

'ne'  ne?  'ne.'  obviously the question wasnt a yes or no answer type. crap. i blew my cover. i mumbled somehting i thought sounded like 'dekuji', thank you, and went to sit and wait as my sister tried on european shoes. enrique was on the radio thing. mhm fun.  i found an awesome jacket, red and black mixy thing, european style, that i REEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY wanted, but psssh it was Kc1900!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats like 70 80$!!!!!!! holy mother!!!! then a shirt that was Kc700 or so, an ok price, but it was only large. so that was totally fruitless. crap. i have many more days tho.  what to do??????????  im gonna copy this to blog for kicks. its getting long. LIVE WITH IT  much love  peace  ^z^z^alex^z^z^   '
