       SURRENDER   When most people think of the word surrender, they immediately visualize a white flag being waved.  It is indicative of giving up or being a loser.  In Western Culture surrender is synonomous with weakness in a arena where only winners are strong and celebrated.  People don't want to surrender.  We are taught to fight, to win - at all costs.  Yet I would argue to say that there is strength in surrender.   Imagine that you have fallen into a lake or the sea and you begin fighting to stay above the water.  You kick and scream and flail your arms, yet all you seem to do is sink and swallow water.  In a short time, if you continue with this approach, you will drown.  However, if you lean back and relax, you will find that you will float on the surface of the water as the current eventually carries you to the shore.  In this instance, surrender is a good thing while fighting is a bad thing.  Perhaps you know someone who has worked hard all their life, fighting and struggling to make a living only to be diagnosed with an illness such as cancer later in life.  When threatened with impending death, they had to make changes in their lifestyle.  They may have had to quit working so hard or so much.  They may have been required to change their eating and drinking habits and make time for exercise.  They find themselves paying attention to thoughts and feelings that they have been running from for years.  They realize that it's just as easy to say a kind word about someone or something as it is to be critical.  If they made these changes, their health may improved or perhaps they were able to find peace in their final moments and make their transition with grace.  We grow up by learning to control the people and situations in our lives.  As babies, we learn to cry when we are hungry or uncomfortable and then become confused when we can no longer have our needs met by crying as we grow older.  We may feel that we must say certain things or act in a certain way to please others or get what we need.  We may feel we have to be someone else in order to make someone like us or love us or be accepted.  However, if we try to manipulate the people in our lives, they will never truly love or accept us and, more importantly, we will never truly love or accept ourselves.    Sometimes we experience conflict with others or organizations and we feel we must hold a grudge out of principle than to let it go for our own emotional and mental health.  In addition to the damage this does to our mind and spirit, it also manifests in our bodies as muscle tension and high blood pressure.  In time, it will eat away at our bodies and maifest as dis-ease unless we learn to give up  or surrender our grudge. We fear that if we forgive someone that we lose or present ourselves as weak.  We are afraid that we are holding up a white flag of surrender.  In reality, it takes a lot of strength to let something go.  We choose our battles and how we choose to use our natural resources, and yes, peace of mind is a natural resource.  When we continue to maintain hard feelings at someone or some situation, we continue to allow them to control us and they win.  We don't forgive others in order to prevent ourselves from being hurt again, but in reality, we just continue to allow us to hurt ourselves.  Sometimes we have been trying to control situations for so long that we don't know how to let go.  Any other way to handle the situation seems uncomfortable or scarey because we have been living in such an unhealthy way for so long.  Pain is the only thing an abused puppy knows until it experiences loving treatment.  Sometimes we have to start where we can and that may just be the effort of be willing to surrender another person or situation to the universe.  When we get out of the way and allow a higher power to handle things in a way that it sees fit, miraculous results can occur.  It takes courage to practice the art of surrender.  Do you feel brave today?  If not, are you willing to be brave today?  What are you holding on inside of you that you can give up today?   Toolbox   Just for today, give up the need to control other people and situations.  Simply observe the world around you without judgment and notice what is going on inside you.  What are you feeling?  What are you thinking?  What are you doing?  Can you allow yourself to just be... even for a moment?  Practice closing your eyes and focus on your breathing.  Consciously give yourself permission to let everything go and just allow yourself the luxury of being at peace with yourself for a few moments.  When you feel at peace, open your eyes and bring this sense of serenity back to the everyday world with you.  Repeat as needed.  Make a list of the people or situations that you are trying to control or make happen in your life.  Read the list to yourself and say, "I'm willing to surrender these people and situations to the universe."  Rip up the piece of paper and throw it away.   Affirmation    Today I am willing to surrender everything to Spirit and I am at peace.

       HIGHER POWER   From the earliest beginnings of mankind, we have looked to nature and the heavens for a creator.  When the hunt was good and there was plenty to eat, we thanked the gods and when the weather turned against us, we feared them.  As mankind moved away from tribes who focused exclusively on hunting and formed villages with an emphasis on farming, the idea of God transitioned as well.  They became the figurehead for a particular purpose or need in the community.  Female fertility godesses appeared to bring abundance in farming and producing children.  By the rise of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome, the gods and godesses had involved into three-dimensional characters that had detailed origins and histories.  With flair and personlity their adventures told the story of how the world was made and what particular influence they had over mankind.  They were very similar to the Justice League of America (JLA), which is the fictious organization whose members consist of Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, etc.    Next, the idea of one and only one God came to be for a brief time in Egypt and eventually with the Hebrew people who longed to separate themselves as much as possible from the gentiles.  The new and improved one God proved very helpful.  He led the Hewbrews out of Egypt and provided mana from the heavens before eventually leading them into the promised land.  The relationship with the Hebrew God of the Old Testament was often a rocky one as the Hebrews sometimes fell out of His pleasure.  This God was a jealous God and would smite someone at the drop of a hat.  However, in the New Testament, Jesus spoke of a kind, loving Father who only wanted His children to forgive and love one another.  This was a far cry from the God of the Old Testament.  I sometimes find it helpful to think of it using this analogy: God of the Old Testament equals God before prozac; and the God of the New Testament equals God after prozac.  It was really quite a change in personality.  Various churches have painted different images of God over the past 2,000 years and many people in the United States grow up seeing themselves as sinners unworthy of the love from their judgmental God.  We are to accept what church leaders tell us without questioning.  We become sheep and do not have a personal relationship with God, but instead our interaction is mediated by a third party.  Over the last fifty years or so more and more people have begun to think for themselves and have left the churches.  In time, they find themselves longing for a connection with their creator, but refuse to accept the God they have been given in the past.  In fact, some people have been victimized by some church members in such a way that they may be uncomfortable using the name God.  That’s okay.  Find another a name that feels comfortable and begin using that name instead.  It may be Lord, Allah, Godess, the Universe or even just your Higher Power.  Use this name for as long as you like.  If one day it no longer feels appropriate, choose the name that feels right at that time.  You can always change it later if you feel so led.  More people are beginning to expand their consciousness of the world around them and in doing so our concept of God is changing too.  Most people no longer see God as a bearded man on a throne in the heavens.  God has now taken on the persona of an unconditional loving energy who wants the very best for you.  There is nothing you can do that will cause God to forsake that unconditional love for you.  God loves you and has loved you even if you have been angry at God for things that have happened in your life and had to turn away from God for a while.  God does not insist that we suffer or feel unworthy.  God wants us to feel worthy of His love and in accepting this idea, we find that we are able to open ourselves up to more good.   From The Foxhole   After the events of September 11,2001, Orlando found himself lost and needing comfort, but did not feel worthy to turn to God because he had previously divorced his wife and threw himself into his career.  The following Sunday, he visited a local church and reconnected with God.  "I realized that it didn't matter that my wife and I had divorced and I had run away from the pain by focusing all my attention on work.  Like the story of the Prodigal Son, God was just happy to have me come home."  Linda had been excommunicated from the church she grew up in after confiding in her youth minister that she was a lesbian.  Feeling abandoned by both God and her church family, Linda walked away from the church for over fifteen years since she could not reconcile her sexuality with her religion.    One afternoon, Linda was hiking in the mountains and looked out at the view before her.  "It was so breathe taking I had to sit down.  I looked out at the creation before me and realized I was homesick for a relationship with my creator.  A thought came to me that religion and spirituality are not the same thing. It was so storng I began to read as many books as I could on spirituality. I soon realized that God didn't care who I slept with and in time, I decided the name Godess felt more comfortable to me and being outdoors in nature is my church.  Whenever I feel disconnected, I go outdoors and look at all the beauty around me and I no longer feel alone.  If I have a question, an answer will often come to me."   Toolbox   Just for today, imagine that God is with you at all times, loving you and supporting you.  When challenges come up, just for grins, ask God for assistance and see what happens.  Imagine that God is giving you the answer.  Don’t worry if you feel that you’re making it up, just go along with it and see what happens.  Being aware of God takes practice, but in time you will definitely see the results.  Get comfortable, close your eyes and relax.  Think about a higher power for a few moments.  Focus on what you feel.  Is there a name that comes to mind for this higher power?  Is it God?  Allah?  Jesus?  Lord?  The Universe?  Godess?  Spirit? Or maybe just Higher Power?  Choose a name for God and begin using it.  If you find in time, that this name no longer feels comfortable, choose a new one at that time.  Spend some time in nature and look at God’s handiwork.  Watch a sunset and marvel at the way the colors melt in the evening sky.  Drive to the mountains and experience the awe of these huge formations of rock.  Go to the beach and allow the rhythm of crashing waves to lull you into a peaceful state.  Remind yourself that the Universe not only created these amazing works of nature, it also created you.  Therefore, you must be something special as well.  Be willing to consider this idea, even if it feels strange or uncomfortable.   Affirmation    I am now aware of my Higher Power in my world.

      HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!! Tonight is the Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden & I think I'm ready for it! My fingernails are currently painted black & I can see black lipstick, fake eyelashes, fishnet stockings, a wig and a pair of wings in my future.

      Another busy day! After I left work 35 minutes late yesterday, the plan to get these presentation books copied & out the door (via overnight to L.A.) was for me to walk the book about 5 or 6 blocks to Kinko’s and have them make the 27 copies over the course of about 2 hours. Then I would have to go pick them up, bring them back to the office, hole-punch and then spiral-bind each one. Oh, and insert dividers for each of the 3 section. Not too bad, except that I wasn’t going to get the presentation until around Noon. Now, all of that has changed. Our Production Dept. will be able to complete the job on time for me to send them out today. However, I am now at the Production Dept’s beck & call for the rest of the day. Oh well, so much for a nice leisurely day without the boss.  On the laundry front, I was supposed to do them on Sunday; however, I kept Jackson on Sunday and didn’t get a chance to do them. Mondays are too busy to do them after work. So then my plan was to prep them and do them just as soon as I walked in the door from work yesterday. As noted, I was about 45 minutes late getting home yesterday so that ruled laundry duty. But today is the day!! I don’t care if I’m doing them at 10 o’clock tonight because we need our underwear back!! I’m trying to clear up my Thursday night so that I can go over to Amanda’s and meet her cousin. Friday night, Olivia, Chris and I are going to the Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden. We might even be able to score some backstage passes and party with the band afterward since Amanda’s cousin is a groupie and can get us in. This all remains to be seen since I haven’t actually met this cousin of hers. If we don’t party with the band, then I think Olivia and I will be going to Hogs & Heffers, which is the bar made famous by the movie Coyote Ugly. I plan on recovering Saturday, so that rules out laundry on that day! Busy, busy!  OK, now off to find some lunch and then back to the grindstone!

      Hey boo, not too much has been happenin round here, as always. But that's a good thing. No news is good news, right? Work is getting more and more stressful evryday. There are so many things I have to remember, sometimes I end up scanning in my pens and pencils rather than the pictures I'm supposed to be working on. Oh no!!! Roni is here to give me a ride home, so I will see you so very soon!!!!!!!!!! Love you!! And your little boy, too!

      Yesterday was so busy that I didn’t have time to post to my blog. Well, onto another day then. My boss left work an hour early yesterday because someone forgot to reset the office clock. I told him he deserved the extra hour. (Wonder if that will be reflected in a pay raise or bonus this year?) I did send him a nice basket of goodies for Boss’s day.  The latest to partake in the sweatshop clothing industry (unknowingly, of course) is Sean “P. Diddy” Combs. His clothing line, Sean Jean, is accused of using a Honduran sweatshop. It’s reported that they pay their workers $0.25 per $50 shirt that they sew. They work 11 to 12 hour shifts, subjected to daily body searches and contaminated drinking water. Ok, so I will not complain about my job today.  In a sad note, The Price is Right announcer Rod Roddy, died Monday at the age of 66.  And on this day in 1886: the Statue of Liberty, a gift from the people of France, was dedicated in New York Harbor.  OK, another busy day so I gotta get busy!

      It's the end of the weekend and I'm sitting here threatening my cat, Berg, with the water bottle in an effort to keep him from scratching at the front door. I think he does it just to get sprayed. I had a paper shopping bag on the floor yesterday and he climbed inside and sat like he was the king of the bag. I took a picture of him looking all regal-like. We have so many pictures of him on our computer, he has his own folder.  This weekend was the Gallien/LaCour family reunion, which is my Mom's side of the family. I hear that everything was very nice and everyone had a lovely time. Someone scored me my very own freshly printed copy of the   Gallien Family Cookbook  . I'm very excited about it! I'm very excited to learn that my cousin, Rachael Gallien Smith, is pregnant for the 2nd time! I have more to add to that list: 3 ladies at my work - Bea, Anna & Jenn. Very exciting indeed! I wonder if 2 more people I know will also become pregnant, as they say that these things happen in 3's. Hey, the theory held true last time!  Chris is working his little toes off at the Westin today. He had to work a double like he did last week. He hasn't actually called me today so I can only assume that means that he's been very busy today. That's good since time will have gone by faster for him. Jackson came over today & we played video games and watched Daredevil. We had a good time and then he had to go home and do his homework. I'm now on the phone with Becca, so I have to go now.

      FRIDAY! YEAH, FRIDAY! Chris and some of his new friends from the Mandarin Oriental are supposed to go bowling tonight at Chelsea Piers. They have black light bowling at this place. Even the pins glow in the dark! I wish I were going, but alas, I don’t think I’m invited. Maybe some time soon Cindy, Jackson, Chris and I can go and have some fun!   When you think of New York City, you think about how crowded it is with all of these millions of people, Times Square, cars honking, yellow cabs rushing past, Central Park, city buses and subway trains. As far as city pets are concerned, you’d also think most people would stick to the usual house cats and dogs of various sizes. Animals such as a dozen snakes, an alligator or a tiger would seem to be somewhat far-fetched, right? Not so, my friend, no so. But I can at least say that these animals seem to be confined to Harlem or the Upper West Side of Manhattan anyway. Let’s just hope they don’t find any of these pets in Queens.  In the news: A Swedish tourist tried to smuggle eight baby snakes into Australia. They found four venomous baby king cobras and four baby emerald tree boas strapped to his legs in homemade pouches. The cobras had died during the nine-hour flight, but the boas survived. He had planned to sell the snakes for $3500 in order to fund an eight-day vacation.  OK, flu shot done! I’m a big girl, I didn’t cry or pass out – go me!! Now my arm hurts though. It hurts more now than it did when she stuck my arm with the needle.

      A new episode of FRIENDS comes on tonight! I’m very excited! And Chris doesn’t have to work tonight, so we get to spend some time together!! Today is a good day – so far. Tomorrow we get free flu shots here at work. Nice little incentive they give us here at my work. It’s free for me & Chris, but there’s no way I’ll be able to get Chris around a needle much less have him volunteer to be stuck by one.  Today I find myself stuffing envelopes with invites to each state treasurer for the National Association of State Treasurers meeting here in NYC. Our company is hosting a dinner and program for them, which includes Jeff Greenfield (political commentator and reporter) as speaker. Meanwhile, I’m also looking for flights home for Christmas. These airlines are really sticking it to us with these holiday fares! Normally, it costs me about $225-$250 to fly home roundtrip. For Christmas, I’m seeing fares anywhere from $285 on up. I still don’t know if Chris will get to come home for Christmas. I keep trying to get him to give me an answer so that I can go ahead and get tickets.  Little known fact: Tuberculosis was New York City’s leading killer in 1913. It was also known as consumption because of the way it consumed its emaciated victims.

      Wow! It’s quite chilly outside & the temperature is supposed to drop throughout the day. Definitely a leather coat type of day! I’ve just read that the “hot” Halloween costumes for women these days are Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders or to dress as Trinity from the Matrix – just in case you’re still looking for ideas. Also in the news: the next installment of “Surreal Life” will include both Tammy Faye Messner (the ex-Mrs. Baker) and Ron Jeremy (the porn king). OK, so does anyone else see any conflicts of interest here? The show will also include Vanilla Ice, “ChiPs” actor Erik Estrada, “Baywatch” actress Tracy Bingham, “Real World: Las Vegas” housemate Trishelle.  One of the ladies I work with, Ada, just got back from France. She brought us some lavender soaps when she went to visit the factory at Le Chateau du Bois. They smell soooo good!! A small observation from my little desk here on the 36th floor in Rockefeller Plaza: there are a lot of people that I work with who literally drag their feet when the walk. I’m totally shocked as I stop myself from saying, “Pick up your feet!” They all sound like they’re trying to ski on carpet.  On this day in 1962: President Kennedy announced an air and naval blockade of Cuba, following the discovery of Soviet missile bases on the island. (courtesy of nytimes.com)

      Another day, another dollar, another headache. Today is my 3rd and final day to sit in for the president’s assistant. This morning, he gave me a box of 4 chocolates that he got at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington DC last week. I’m saving them for dessert! No leftovers for lunch; Subway instead. It’s double stamp day!!    So what else is new? They say that today is an “Indian Summer” day – which for us means that the high for today is 69. I’m all for Indian Summer days!   In today’s HEADLINES dept: A man is suing Wheel of Fortune host, Pat Sajak, over a hug he received on the show that he claims hurt his back so bad, he needed surgery and months of rehab. A Michigan man survived a plunge over Niagara Falls. He wore no protective devices, etc., just the clothes on his back. Amazing, but now he’s wearing handcuffs and is sitting in some holding cell somewhere in Ontario. I’m currently reading a story on the Times Picayune website about this bacterium that appears as a small bump and then swells and is very painful. As it turns out, this mysterious little bacterium is resistant to penicillin, etc. It’s very contagious. I’ll let you know how it turns out.  And on this day in 1879, Thomas Edison invented a workable electric light at his laboratory in Menlo Park, NJ. (courtesy New York Times)

      Today is my 2nd day of sitting in for the President’s assistant. I have a feeling (and hope) that today will be even duller than this past Friday. Laurren, the president’s assistant, is in California for about 6 weeks working on her acting career. This weekend I was pretty lazy, but then again, when has my weekend been exciting lately? I made King Ranch Chicken Casserole yesterday evening and it is pretty good, but it doesn’t beat my Mom’s.  Big CONGRATULATIONS go out to JASON & JENNIFER WHITTINGTON, who just got married this past Saturday in Natchitoches, La.  New findings from this weekend: there is a device called an Octadog, which turns an ordinary hotdog into an octopus you can eat. Interesting and just a bit scary as well! (MSRP $16.95) I also discovered a popcorn fork – so you don’t have to worry about getting that pesky butter all over your fingers cause I know that’s always been my biggest problem!! Today’s discovery is: “Snapple Pie” hits store shelves. OK, it’s not an actual pie but an apple pie flavored Snapple drink. It’s only available for a limited time (Oct-Dec 2003) to coincide with apple picking and the holiday season. Do I dare try this one?  OK, now onto this whole David Blaine stunt. I can’t figure out why anyone would want to literally starve themselves for, what, 44 days?!? Publicity? Is he just that vain? I don’t know. Now the guy will have to be weaned back onto solid foods. I mean is that the sort of thing that tickles his fancy? I guess we all know what our own reactions would be to that sort of proposition. You certainly didn’t catch me hanging from a cardboard box suspended 10 feet above the ground behind my Queens apartment building, now did you?  Oh, and now for the kicker: There are reports that Prince (yep, the rock star, Prince) has been going from door to door to door sharing his Jehovah’s witness faith in the Minneapolis area. Now if that isn’t strange . . .

      It certainly has been a lazy weekend for me. I actually got to spend some time with Chris Friday night and Saturday morning - it was a real treat! I made raspberry scones for breakfast (it was a mix). Now it's Sunday morning and after only an hour of sleep, Chris is back at work to pull a double. I would feel bad for him except the only reason he got so little sleep was because he and Sergio went out for drinks after work. Sergio ended up crashing here as he also had to be back up at work to pull a double today. I'm just hoping that they let Chris come home early so he can get a little sleep.  Otherwise, it's all been pretty quiet. The weather is really beginning to get cold out there. This time of year usually marks the beginning of my semi-hibernation. The colder it gets outside, the less you'll see me on the streets of Manhattan! That's what I hate so much about living up here - because this shit lasts for about 6 months. I'm going to try to be better this year than I was last year. I just ended up getting really depressed about the whole situation, but I'm hoping I can pull out of it this time around. We'll see!

      WE’RE GOING TO THE WORLD SERIES BABY!! GO YANKEES!! OK, so I didn’t stay up and watch the end of the game, but I’m glad they’re going nonetheless. Today is finally Friday and I, technically, get to sleep in tomorrow morning depending upon what time Chris has to get up to go to work. That boy could use some sleep for sure! But I know if we have some spare time, he wants to go see Kill Bill.  Today’s lunch consists of leftovers from last night’s meal. I baked boneless, skinless chicken breasts along with potatoes & carrots – all sprinkled with some Lipton Onion soup mix & garlic salt. It turned out quite nice indeed! Unfortunately, there weren’t any carrots left over from last night’s meal, so I have to run down to Au Bon Pain at around Noon to pick up a little something to accompany my chicken and potatoes.

      I’m really excited today since I can get a large soup for just $3 from Hale & Hearty Soups!! I’ve been looking forward to it since that tall strange man shoved the institutional green flyer at me yesterday afternoon. I was about to tell him off until I heard exactly what he said. Then I’m like “Hell Yeah!!” On a sad front, there was the whole State Island Ferry accident yesterday afternoon. Luckily, I don’t like on Staten Island and to be quite honest, I’m not sure why anyone would – it’s entirely too far away!!  On a good note, after Chris is done with orientation today (around 4 pm) he’s free to go home and sleep his little heart out. He’s done well this week working both jobs, etc., but I noticed this morning that he didn’t roll out of bed in his usual chipper mood. I think this schedule is beginning to take its toll on him and I wonder if it will really ever get any better unless he quits one of these jobs. Looks like we’ll have to wait and see.  Hey Bec, get your cats fixed - especially the male - unless you want him to start spraying in the corners. I hear you can never really get rid of that smell. Well, off to my discounted soup . . .

      Hey Donna boo. I see you've been very busy these past few days. You should dismantle that push cart for what it did to you. No push cart will ever hurt you again!  Not too much has been going on around here. Work is keeping me busy. But it pays the bills, so I refuse to complain! Mr Lovan Tomas (my kittie) is about to lose his manhood. Roni and I have finally saved enough pennies that we can now take his hairy ass to a doctor that works out of his back yard. Just playin. But we are castrating him. That'll teach him to sniff ass around our house.  Well, I guess I must get back to work now. I hope your week is so great you'll need two days to recover.......I love you!!!

      I’ve never considered myself a sports fan. I mean, I’ve gone to a Mets game, but that was over a year ago (August 2001). During that outing, I purchased: a Mike Piazza jersey, the commemorative beer cup and various eats/beer that tinkered on the verge of $100 for the day. I had a blast, but it was an expensive outing nonetheless. Fast forward to the ALCS 2003: NY Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox. I’ll admit that I’m not glued to the TV as soon as it comes on, but I’ve actually been pulling for the Yankees (Amanda pulls for the Red Sox). Chris and I actually sat down Saturday night and watched one of the games – OK, so he fell asleep while I watched the game. And I was just as shocked as everyone else when a fan reached out and snatched the ball away from the Cubs preventing them from making the 2nd out in the 8th inning in last night’s game. I’m no diehard, but I’m wondering where this newfound interest in baseball is coming from. Incidentally, last night Chris ending up having to work a little late at the Westin due to the Red Sox coming in.  They always seem to stay at the Westin, which is nice for Chris since they tip well, but their luggage rolled in shortly afterwards and they ended up doing room drops.  But as long as they tip well . . .  By the way, if you’re keeping count, today’s lunch will either consist of a chicken, broccoli & cheese hot pocket or (if I’m being bad) a salad, which will cost about $7.  IN THE NEWS: I just read “Rome Rocks to Mother Teresa, the musical.” And then I read another story where a 9-month pregnant woman chased a 4-year-old kid around a McDonald’s restaurant and rubbed hot French fries in his face after he spilled ice cream on her shirt. What is this world coming to, I ask you? Ok, so in case you are unaware, I read news websites all the livelong day while at work trying to keep myself occupied.  I do work when I have it, but for the most part, I have enough spare time to visit about 10 to 12 news sites a day along with other sites.

      Today's lunch is leftover pork chop, corn & scalloped potatoes from last night. Good stuff! I've been busy today at work, which is not exactly the norm around here. Chris has been super busy with all of his working - and as John W puts it, his luggage/baggage fetish. It looks like we'll actually get to see each other this Friday evening, which makes me a very happy girl! Don't know if anyone has checked out Courtenay's blog, but I like to take a look every day as it appears to be much more interesting than my life right now! I'm planning to get a package together to send to her of NYC tourist stuff and if I can find something unique, I'll throw that in there too. Ok, off to take a small walk outside since it will probably be the only sunshine I'll see today. Oh, I just found what I'm going to get my 2 bosses for Bosses Day this Thursday: the Gourmet Orchard Basket from 1-800-flowers. They're really into this eating healthy stuff!

      Monday, Monday, boring Monday. It was so quiet at work that I nearly fell asleep at my desk. Sad, but true. Ah, living in NYC - isn't it glamorous? Amanda is coming over tonight to watch Monster House and wrestling.  Last night, I had the strangest dream: I was driving through these small narrow streets all over this city. Which city, I have no idea. Finally, I park my car and I end up at this diner where they're serving po-boys with sausage, peppers and mashed potatoes & gravy - all on the po-boy! And I'm upset because they're taking forever to take my order when there isn't anyone there. I remember saying how it had been a whole 30 minutes and they just keep staring at me. Why won't they take my order?!? I think I woke up around 4:30 am with a stomach ache and feeling nauseous. Maybe it was from the po-boy.

      I have done pretty much nothing this weekend. Too much to drink Friday evening means recuperating all day Saturday. No more wine!! Beer is safe, wine is bad! Thankfully, Chris took care of me.  By the way, my leg hurts so much from Thursday's fall on top of the push cart.  It has been throbbing like crazy! I couldn't really take anything for it Saturday since I figured I would just throw it up. Today, today will be better . . .

      Today's lunch is cheese ravioli w/tomato & basil sauce from Caccina below Rockefeller Center. Not bad, though it could use more tomato sauce. It has a slight kick to it. Today is finally Friday and I did NOT start the day off on a good foot. To start with, I was bringing laundry back last night in the push cart & with the army bag on top of it when the cart tipped over and I fell on top of it. I didn't fall all the way down, though my right shin is quite bruised today. Then, this morning at Au Bon Pain, I dropped a couple of quarters then a $5 bill.  When I went to pick up the money, I lost my balance and kind of fell, but not all the way (again). Embarrassing, but at that point, I just didn't care anymore. I took my everything bagel and went & ate my breakfast at my desk, only I kept dropping my container of cream cheese on the way back from the kitchen. I just hope no one gives me a child to hold today! I'm afraid of what I might do!  On the job front, Chris started orientation today at the Mandarin Oriental. This whole thing has moved so quickly that he hasn't had time to work out what he'll do with his other job at the Westin. Luckily, he's off for a few days and doesn't have to worry about that until Sunday morning. Ok, got to go down to the messenger center in our building to pick up a food order. Until tonight . . .

      Well, Chris just got a new job - luggage attendant at the Mandarin Oriental New York Hotel at Columbus Circle. He starts orientation tomorrow morning. Everything with this new job has happened very quickly. He still has his job as a luggage attendant at the Westin Times Square. He isn't sure how or what he's going to do just yet about the Westin. He could work there just part time, but he's planning to work the Mandarin Oriental full time as they pay much more per hour. Otherwise, I guess not much is happening up here. We're going out tomorrow night to the Moroccan tapas bar to wish Gerard & Judy all the best in Washington DC. Well, until tomorrow . . .

      Hump day, hump day & feeling a little better day! I think my mixture of Robitussin & Nyquil is doing me some good finally! I'm about to head to lunch with some of the girls I work with. Laurren is leaving for California next week and she'll be gone for a month. We're either going for Thai or Indian food. Speaking of food, we're going to a Moroccan tapas bar on Friday to wish our friends, Gerard Judy & Monique, all the best when they move off to Washington DC. Gerard leaves this Sunday and Judy & Monique will leave in a month. OK, it's off to the Thai place . . . yum!!

      Well, it's Tuesday and I think I'm feeling worse by the day. Whatever I have is about to slam into my chest, so I've decided to put some 'tussin on it. We'll see if that clears it up.   Bec, I've taken a consensus and I don't think you should give Bryant a Mohawk. Turns out that parents really don't appreciate that sort of thing, but if you've got the balls . . . Chris has decided to pay tribute to our friend Ray by dressing up as a transvestite Viking for Halloween if we can find everything he needs. Don't worry, I'll send pictures!   You know, I haven't been to the Fair in years & I absolutely love the Zipper or whatever they're calling it this year. Ironically, I'm terrified of the Ferris Wheel. Go figure!  Well, the weather isn't too bad. It gets into the lower 60s during the day and into the 40s at night. I still can't figure out if what happened over the last 2 or 3 months up here actually qualifies as a summer. I'm dreading the winter this year. Last year was especially rough on me. Nothing beats a good ole Louisiana winter - or really a Louisiana anything! Looks like I'm a bit biased, but who can blame me? ~ Donna

      Chris & I are going to a concert on Halloween night with a girl that I work with - Olivia.  Olivia and I are dressing up. We have wings and wigs - the rest is still kind of up in the air. I think Chris and I may go pick out his costume this weekend.  I found out this morning that our friends Gerard & Judy are moving back to Wasington DC. We haven't seen them since April & now I find out they're leaving in a week - time flies! I was supposed to go over to Amanda's apt. last night to watch Smackdown (wrestling), but I don't feel well and really didn't feel like standing out on the (elevated) train platform waiting for the subway. And wouldn't you know, I walk outside today and can see my breath. I guess it's out with the denim jacket and in with the leather coat. Where has our summer gone I ask you?!? At least it's Friday! I can sleep in tomorrow!! And Becca, Dr. Pepper at 8 am? I'm scared to ask what you're currently eating for breakfast.  It's probably twinkies, chips or twix bars!

      Well, this is my very first post! I just got home from work in midtown Manhattan. It seems that no matter where I live, I do the same thing - put on my pjs as soon as possible!  Creature of habit, i guess. I'm hoping that my future blogs will be more exciting. Maybe after my mixture of Theraflu and Nyquil kicks in, things might get interesting.  We got back Monday night from a little trip to Rayville for a friend's wedding - Brad. We had a blast, we just didn't get any sleep! Well, I guess we'll sleep this weekend. Can't wait to go home for Christmas, maybe even get to see more of my family & friends this time around. Well, till next time or unless something astonishing happens tonight . . .

      I just found the coolest website for ordering  urlLink 80s t-shirts  and memorabilia for all of you holiday shoppers out there. That's all I really have today since I'm on cleaning duty today. I've already done part 1 of dishes and I have just a few more to do, but I ran out of drying space. Go figure. Stupid small apartment. After my coffee and then shower, I'll be off to do laundry which I have done in nearly 2 weeks. Good thing I stocked up on underwear last time I was in Louisiana!  I've discovered that visitors to my website who are using a Macintosh have trouble clicking on my links. I will eventually get the links added to this blog site so that you may access pictures from here. Unfortunately, I don't know a lick about html code as I've just been winging it up until now. I'll have to find out more since the "easy-to-use" wizards that I used to set up these sites is no longer available to me. So much for resting a bit and sitting pretty. Time to get back to work and learn me something. Who knows, if I figure it all out, maybe I can work something out with the Natchitoches Times (newspaper) so they can update their own website and I can read all of the local hometown dirt from the comfort of my leather Administrative Assistant's chair on the 36th floor Rockefeller Center. Perhaps I can teach Becca when I go home at Christmas and she can update their site and thereby pay her more money. Note to Becca - discuss with Charles! You never really know until you ask. And this way, they won't have to contract the job out.

      Thanksgiving! Good! Just Cindy & me for Thanksgiving day, so we ended up drinking, eating and watching the Clean Sweep marathon and then Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood. Ok, so it was a chick-flick kind of day. We had a good time, though. Chris had his turkey dinner on Friday and then we ordered in Chinese Friday night. ENOUGH TURKEY!!  Gay as the day is long - check out this website for “ urlLink Smittens .” Need I say anything else? Anyway, we all remember the Mel Gibson movie  Conspiracy Theory right? Well, they must have based the movie on this guy. Check out this website. I admit that I haven’t finished reading the whole thing since it’s 10 pages long and I have a life, but I read over the first 2 pages. Maybe this guy needs to make a visit to a mental institution.  urlLink http://www.drunkbastard.net/resume.htm   This next little link is just interesting. As a woman, I keep a lot of junk in my purse, but it’s always fun to see what other women have in their purses. Check it out at  urlLink http://www.poeki.net/bags   OK, I really need to do laundry today, but I’ll probably wait until tomorrow since Chris will be at work. Looking around my apartment, I think maybe I need to do a little cleaning as well.

      It’s Pre-Turkey day!! All I have left to get are slivered almonds and a small aluminum-roasting pan. That’s pretty good for me! Cindy took Jackson to the halfway point to Albany where he’ll meet his grandfather and spend Thanksgiving. Tomorrow, she’ll come over and we’ll have a girlie turkey day! I think we’ll be cooking everything at my place, but since we’re basically cooking for 3, there’s not a whole lot to do. I read about this root from Peru that I see all the time at the grocery & produce stores in my neighborhood. It’s called yacon and it’s a root that scientists say is “good for the gut, potentially safeguards against cancer, helps absorption of calcium and vitamins and can lessen the blood sugar peaks from eating sweet food that are a problem for diabetics. Though packed with sugar, its principal appeal to the health conscious lies in the fact that the sugar in question is mainly oligofructose, which cannot be absorbed by the body.” (courtesy MSNBC.com)  Last night, I was surfing the web and came across this link to an anti-rape patent. I’d seen it before, but now that I have an outlet for sharing crazy things with others, here ya go: http://www.levins.com/asm-7.html urlLink

      Hey big donna!!! It's Thanksgiving again. And what are we gonna do this year? That's my big question.  The concert was so f*ck@ng awesome. We got to meet all three bands. After the first band got off stage we went to talk to them and me and Roni were talking to the bassist and the lead singer and then Trevor and Jacob walked off. Roni and I, not wanting to be rude and just walk off too, stood there and talk to them for a few minutes, until Trevor and Jacob came back and told them not to take their girls from them. So, that's pretty exciting, we got hit on by two band guys, hot ones too! I'll have to show yo the pictures as soon as I can figure out how to get them on the computer. But the bad thing was the ride home. Soooo close to Natchitoches and that poo-nanny of a trooper had to make his quota. It's gonna cost me $162, but I think I figured out a way for it not to show up on my insurance. I shouldn't own a car. I don't know what's wrong with me. Everytime I try to be the bestest driver, something stupid always happens. (cough*cough*LOSER*cough*cough)  Mom's cooking stew for us for lunch. I'll eat two bowls, one for me and one for you! Christmas is coming up so fast! I can't wait for everyone to be home. We should definately take some pictures. Well, its time for you to work, young lady, and it's time for me to pretend to work. Tell Chris to take it easy big pimp and I'll see you oh so soon!!!!!  Love you,  Becca

      Too busy to post yesterday from work and I couldn’t access the site once I got home, so here I am today with the updates you’ve all been waiting for: We are now the proud owners of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the extended edition. Who’d have guessed? Probably anyone who knows Chris, that’s who. We had a good weekend. We watched 28 Days Later on Friday night and just hung out and ate popcorn. On Saturday, we headed to Best Buy to pick up our latest round of DVDs. On Sunday, Amanda and I went to Union Square to the Christmas Market. I got a new scarf, which is just the coolest. I also got this little herbal heat/cold pack that I’ll probably give as a Christmas gift to one of my grandparents. Then we went down toward Houston Street to watch the cute guys playing street hockey. So worth the time! Last night, I realize that I hadn’t done my Thanksgiving shopping for Thursday, so it looks like I’ll be running around looking for a turkey breast today and maybe tomorrow. If I can’t find a turkey breast, then we’ll be having ham. Every year before this, Chris has always gotten a turkey from the hotel. I wonder how much this is going to cost? I wrote that last little bit yesterday, so I can now tell you that a 5 lb. turkey breast cost just under $10. And let me just say that pine nuts are quite expensive! My recipe calls for a mixture of pine nuts and slivered almonds. I found the pine nuts, but I still have to go get everything else for my Thanksgiving meal.  I can’t help but feel like I’m stuck in a state of frustration these days. It comes from many angles, most which I cannot openly pinpoint on this public blog. Into my private journals they will go. I’ll be going home in just under 1 month. Yeah! I’m looking forward to it, but I also don’t like flying alone. Not much I can do for that though. I hate leaving Chris behind, but at the same time, I can’t let a free ticket home go to waste – not that I want to! I think my plan this time around is to take as many pictures with our digital camera as possible. I’ll bring our video camera, but I want lots of digital pics!  On Monday’s AP: Border agents last week landed a meaty bust, seizing 756 pounds of bologna arranged into the shape of a car seat and covered with blankets in a man's pickup.  Also, Media mogul Ted Turner has taken a small step to demonstrate his belief that women should run the world because men have "mucked it up" with too much warfare and military spending.  I first read this yesterday evening and I’m not sure exactly what to say about it except, maybe that’s what he deserved. See for yourself: PARTICIPANT AT KKK INITIATION WOUNDED AFTER SHOTS FIRED INTO SKY. JOHNSON CITY, Tennessee (AP) -- A bullet fired in the air during a Ku Klux Klan initiation ceremony came down and struck a participant in the head, critically injuring him, authorities said. Gregory Allen Freeman, 45, was charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment in the Saturday night incident that wounded Jeffery S. Murr, 24. About 10 people, including two children, had gathered for the ceremony. The man who was being initiated was blindfolded, tied with a noose to a tree and shot with paintball guns as Freeman fired a pistol in the air to provide the sound of real gunfire, Sheriff Fred Phillips said. A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited at the bottom of his skull, authorities said. Freeman fled the ceremony but was arrested near his home, authorities said. He was released on $7,500 bail. (courtesy CNN.com)

      The sun is a beautiful thing. It’s so nice to see sunlight. I realize this must seem a strange statement to my friends and family back home, but with all of these tall buildings here in the city, you don’t actually see the sun. I’m so glad that today is Friday! It felt weird not having to wake Chris up at 4 something this morning, but I automatically woke up anyway. Once I remembered that Chris was off today, I turned back over and drifted off to la-la land.  Well, it’s official: The “naked photographer” has been captured in Ohio. This guy, who happens to be a staff lawyer for the state House, ambushed women in order to take pictures of their shocked expressions. Huh? He was charged with public indecency and assault, posted bail and was released. He was then rearrested the following day when investigators searched his home and found incriminating photos, which led to charges of felony kidnapping and gross sexual imposition. Police think he kept these photos as souvenirs. Just goes to show you that being a pack rat can be a bad thing.  There is a story on WNBC.com concerning the death of a college student who died after riding on top of a subway train last weekend, the 6 train to be exact. The stupid thing is that someone did the same thing in October. They died. This most current subway surfer wasn’t alone. Another student died instantly of a fractured skull. The tunnels here in NYC aren’t like those that I’ve seen in Washington DC. In DC, the tunnels are huge. Here, they’re just big enough for the trains to fit through. In sad news, also from WNBC.com, an elderly man was killed by a street sweeper after being crushed and possibly dragged after the sweeper backed up. OK, I read this one and started to pass it up, but I just couldn’t do it. In the Manhattan Supreme Court, celebrities honored jury duty at the Court’s Juror Appreciation Day. In the presence of other famous New Yorkers -- Regis Philbin, James Earl Jones, Ralph Lauren – Twyla Tharp danced, Judy Collins sang, and Jon Stewart joked. Seems silly enough, but read the  urlLink article .   I read an interesting article on MSNBC.com about resistance to the Patriot Act. To be quite honest, I don’t know exactly how I feel about the Act myself, but I thought it was a good read, so check it out.   urlLink http://www.msnbc.com/news/996267.asp?0cv=CB20   People magazine has named Johnny Depp as the Sexiest Man Alive. I agree.  To lose one pound, it is necessary to cheat the body of 3,500 calories — say, 500 a day for a week, or 350 a day for 10 days.

      Not much happening in my world today, thus far. It’s a rainy day here in the Big Apple, but it’s getting brighter outside. If you have access to BBC America (the TV station) and you like shows like Trading Spaces, then you should watch Homefront in the Garden on Wednesdays. You’ll have to check your local listings, but it comes on at 8 pm here. They don’t just re-do your typical garden. What they do is amazing and somewhat mind-blowing. It’s only a 30-minute show so it’s quick to see results. I watched the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show last night on TV. I love lingerie, so I had to watch. They had some very interesting pieces showcased. If only my closet was big enough . . .   There’s a story out on the web about a guy in Ohio who is in jail on forgery charges. He struck a deal for them to table his transfer from a local jail to a state prison all so that he could watch a football game on TV over the weekend. The place where he’s going doesn’t have TV for inmates. Interesting fact courtesy of NYTIMES.com: Berlin is the world's first major city to switch from analog to entirely digital television broadcasting. The transition went almost unnoticed in Germany or elsewhere, which is remarkable, given that in the United States, the same process has been bogged down by politics.  On a poll on CNN.com this morning, the question was raised “Are you shocked by the charges against Michael Jackson?” Not surprisingly, 93% weren’t shocked. Go figure.  That’s really all for today. I’m going home for Christmas one month from today. I don’t like leaving Chris alone during Christmas, but I can’t pass up a free trip home either. I can justify my guilt by reminding myself that he’ll be working the entire time anyway. It’s a good thing Mom & Dad have a new calling plan that allows them to call nationwide for no extra charge. Hope they’re not surprised when they get their bill and find that I called Chris at 3 am local time every morning to wake him up. Oh! And I’m working on filling out my insurance forms for re-enrollment for next year. Pain in the ass, let me tell ya!! Well, it’s getting closer to lunch time - time to post. I think Dawn & I will be heading to Au Bon Pain today. She wants a salad and I think I’m going to get a tuna sandwich. I’ve had soup at least 3 times this week. I’m tired of soup. Watch me end up getting soup.

      By now, you’ve surely seen or heard the stories that Michael Jackson’s estate, Neverland Ranch, was searched by investigators on claims than another 12 or 13-year-old boy was molested while on the property. Police came armed with an arrest warrant with Jackson’s name along with 60 to 70 investigators. From dangling babies over the side of balconies to admittedly sleeping in the same bed as young children that he brings into his home, it’s about time someone or some agency investigated this man. I’ll agree that he was all the rage in the 80’s, but there is a limit! Oh, and I was watching the news this morning as I’m getting ready and I see that a few Wall Street brokers were arrested for taking commissions on deals that never went through. Bad brokers. Can’t really feel sorry for them since what they did was wrong and I see them as being a money-hungry type of person anyway. I guess it really doesn’t surprise me that they’ve finally been arrested.  On the war front, Chris & I have a friend who is in the Marines, Jeremy Lewis. He’s like 20 to 40 days away from getting out, but his group has been pulled to go to Iraq. I don’t know how long he’ll be there and I’m not sure he really knows either. Once he finishes over there, he’ll come back home and then he’ll have an additional 90 days left to complete. Then he’ll finally be released. I’ll be happy when that happens.   Interesting fact for you on this rainy Wednesday: The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any other country by far. Each American, on average, generates about 45,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. That is about twice as much as the average person living in Japan or Europe.  I read a story this morning on how women are getting their feet surgically altered in order to wear fashionable shoes. The surgeries are actually medically necessary or would be at some point. They are for removing corns, calluses, bunions, correcting hammertoes, etc., which I can’t knock. I think it was the quote at the end of the story by flight attendant Gloria Diaz: “I don't care what my feet feel like," she said. "I will wear a beautiful shoe no matter how much it hurts if I have to, but now it doesn't have to hurt!" (courtesy MSNBC.com)  OK, and finally for one of the most insane things I’ve heard/read lately: Hip-hop magazine, The Source, has accused Eminem, the rapper, of racism. He allegedly said, “Black girls are dumb, and white girls are good chicks” on an album that dates back to 1993. On the tape, he was rapping about his breakup with his black girlfriend. He said that he made it out of frustration right after their breakup. I’m not saying that he didn’t say this, but has ANYONE listened to his songs? Is this suddenly the only outlandish thing he’s done? The guy has been sued by his own mother – enough said. He’s always been followed by controversy. It’s what he does best.  Wait, I just read something else that, well, as Jerry Brown puts it, “makes your bootie wink”: A Texas baby is recovering Tuesday, one day after doctors at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park created an anal opening for him. Chief of Pediatric Surgery Dr. Alberto Pena performed the rare anorectal surgery on the 10-month-old baby boy Monday. The operation was teleconferenced live to Hadassah Hospital in Israel, where about 80 surgeons from Israel, Greece, Turkey and Italy watched. Pena developed the procedure and has done about 1,700 anorectal surgeries since 1986. He says the problem is a birth defect in which the anus and rectum do not develop properly. This type of malformation affects one in 5,000 newborns annually. (courtesy WNBC.com)  And finally, on this day in 1863: President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.

      So far, today is a much more relaxed day than yesterday. However, I now have my “irk” of the day: I booked roundtrip tickets for someone that I work for. I was given the dates by someone else. Flights booked, itinerary printed, placed in folder & given to traveler. Today, I find out that they never went on that trip nor was it cancelled. We’ve lost the money on that trip and we really can’t do anything about it. I feel like yelling at the person who gave me the dates because she looks at me all innocently, but I’m not going to yell or really say anything because it wouldn’t do any good. In truth, she could have given me the correct dates and I just screwed everything up myself. Who really knows at this point? Luckily, it wasn’t one of our most expensive trips. Instead, I’ll just take a few deep breaths and try to think about other things and how I can make this whole situation better. But I still want to hit something.  In breaking news: the Massachusetts' highest court today ruled that the state couldn’t deny gays and lesbians the right to marry. The court stopped short of allowing marriage licenses to be issued to the couples that challenged the existing law -- and gave the state Legislature 180 days to find a solution. (courtesy CNN.com) Interesting development considering if one state allows same sex marriages, then all states must allow them. I’ll be curious to see how this one ends.  We’ve all heard of jelly bracelets. We wore them in the 80’s (a-la Madonna style) and they are of course making a comeback. However, in some of the local schools here in NYC, the jelly bracelets are associated with a game called “snap” in which different colored bracelets represent different sexual acts. In some variations of the game, a yellow bracelet symbolizes hugging; purple means kissing; blue means oral sex; and red means a lap dance and if someone breaks a bracelet, he or she is entitled to a sexual favor. I, for one, cannot believe this! Its nuts! These kids are like 12 and 13 years old. They’re KIDS! They’ve likened to a modern day form of spin-the-bottle. You know, I hate to admit it, but of the 2 or 3 times I played spin-the-bottle, I always hoped it would never land on me! I hated that game!

      WOW! I am tee-total tired! And yet, well, actually I was going to say something along the lines of: since I've been so busy or since I haven't been able to devote more time to my blogs as of late . . . but truthfully, I just feel like blogging one more time on this lovely November Monday. Amanda is coming over in about an hour to watch wrestling with me and I can't decide if I want to cook or not. To be honest, I really don't   want   to cook, but I don't necessarily want to spend the money on take-out. OK, that's not quite right either. It's really "ordering in" because we all know at this point in the day, I'm not getting dressed again to go outside. My feet hurt. Darn boots.  Nothing too exciting is happening in my life right now. Chris is working, working and I'll get to see him again on Friday - except for the 20 minutes or so I see him during the 4 am hour to rouse him out of bed by scratching his back. Maybe that's why it takes him 4 tries to get up, but probably not. I mean, if I only got 4 hours of sleep a night 5 days a week, it would probably take many tries before I got out of bed. Don't know how he does it.  Berg, our cat, just threw up on the living room carpet. Gee, thanks. Darn hairballs. Which reminds me, but I can't really remember if I blogged about this the other day, anyway, this lady brought her 3-year-old child to a doctor to have a huge hairball removed from the girl's stomach. Turns out that she has that disease that makes you pull your hair out at the roots -  urlLink Trichotillomannia . Kind of crazy - and that was what I was reminded of just then. Thanks Berg! Hopefully someone has learned something today - even if it's only that there is a disease out there for pulling out your hair. Good boy! Down Berg - don't attack. He's such an angry cat. Alright, now I'm heading off to order in some supper. It'll either be pizza or Chinese. Probably Chinese.

      Busy, busy again today. Laurren is back from California! I got her some Gerber daisies and made a sign that said “Welcome Back Laurren,” which I colored with crayons yesterday evening while I was watching JFK. I’m kind of glad that I watched that movie when I did because today I’m watching the Today Show on NBC and they interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald’s brother. Can’t remember exactly what year JFK was assassinated, but it’s getting closer to the anniversary (40 years, I think) so, of course, they’re re-hashing everything. Good movie if you like that sort of thing. I do. Anyway, the weekend went pretty well. On Friday, Chris and I went out to eat at Uno Pizzeria and then watched Matrix Revolutions. Both excellent! We brought our new camcorder along to play with so that we could learn how to use it. On Saturday, we went to Best Buy in Queens and bought like 5 movies along with a carrying case for the new camcorder. Always much fun at Best Buy, but you can’t stay in there too long or Chris will go nuts! On Sunday while Chris worked, I stayed home and did some light cleaning and that was about it. I rested as much as I could since I figured that today would be pretty busy since I have lots of presentation materials to get out this evening. I may be staying late today . . .  Interesting read on ABCnews.com: a British multimillionaire will hand over his infant to a gorilla for a night of baby-sitting. He says that’s kind of how he grew up, only odder. Very strange man indeed and I’ll be surprised if there aren’t any protests, but we can only wait and see. In a story out of Shreveport which I found on CNN.com, it is reported that Southern drawls & accents have thwarted voice recognition systems used to route non-emergency calls. I guess we’re just too complicated for their high-tech systems!!  OK, I must go find something good for lunch today – hopefully something warm instead of just a sandwich or salad. Later kids!

      As I walk down the hallway to get my morning cup of coffee here at work, I feel like I’m on a ship in the high seas. The building is creaking and moaning. Luckily, since I’m an avid watcher of the Discovery Channel, I know the building is supposed to move in high winds.  Keeps the whole things from toppling over.  I would say that I’m not sure what to make of the Senate’s 40-hour talk-a-thon, but realistically, it’s just a big publicity stunt that has wasted time and taxpayer dollars. It all has to do with the approval of Bush-backed judges. According to Senator Rick Santorum, "Never in the history of the United States Senate have we required more than a simple majority to confirm a judge. And now, this year, the Senate Democrats have decided they're going to raise the bar to 60." (courtesy CNN.com) I think that pretty much explains it in a nutshell and I don’t know if I even want to spend more time on this silly little subject, so I won’t.  Not enough time to get into everything I’d like to right now, but we got a new camcorder yesterday. Chris surprised me with it! Good boy!  P.S. Christie, from yesterday's blog, is Chris's cousin. Oh! And Mom is being released from the hospital as I type. Nothing but rest scheduled for her this weekend - and I think she deserves it after all she's been through!

      CONGRATULATIONS! Christie & Bruce Bolton had a little girl: ANNA BELLE BOLTON at around Noon yesterday.  She weighed 7 pounds 14 ounces.  I’ve been a busy little bee here at work lately. Tired as all get out by the end of the day. The only good thing about it is that it makes the day fly by – that and we’ll be getting end of the year bonuses and raises soon, so I’m hoping someone is taking notice of all of my hard work. Mom is doing well and getting better. She’ll either get out of the hospital today or tomorrow. The weather is supposed to be dropping throughout the day today and very windy – gusts up to 60 mph. I guess we have it easy though since Los Angeles is getting pelted with hail and snow. I didn’t know that it even snowed in L.A. What is behind all of this crazy weather?  There’s not a whole lot happening in today’s news – at least that I’ve had time to read anyway. One little tidbit though: the women of Wal-Mart are posing for Playboy. I guess eventually, they’ll also have the women of Target and Brookshire’s.  OK, back to work to make more travel arrangements.

      Another rainy day. Yuk! Good news is that Mom is doing well after her surgery. I’m hoping that they eventually give her solid foods or she might get cranky. I know I would. This morning as I’m trying to get Chris out of bed to go to work, he tells me that I’m being mean to him. However, he didn’t mention how nice I was to him the prior 3 times the alarm went off. I even scratched his back on the 3rd attempt to get him up. I’m a little hurt.  I was reading a story in the Offbeat News section of CNN.com about new protests against Naked Sushi night at a restaurant called Banzai in Seattle. A model wears nothing but a thong and a couple of strategically placed flower petals. Plastic wrap is then placed over her torso and then the sushi is placed on the plastic. This little event takes place once a month at the restaurant. I’m totally sure how I feel about this issue. The protestors argue that this degrades women and will promote violence against women. On the flip side, the restaurant and patrons alike claim that this is a work of art.  Seems that some children in Brooklyn found a US Army issued missile launcher in a trash can in their neighborhood. An adult took it away from them and dropped it off at a police station. Luckily, the thing was inoperable, but could you imagine?!?  Of course, were would we be without the shock of the day: millionaire Robert Durst was found not guilty of murdering 71-year-old Morris Black of Galveston, TX. He actually admitted to killing him, hacking his body up into pieces and then throwing them into Galveston Bay. He then fled from Texas and returned to move the head since he thought it could be used to identify the victim. After doing that, he winds up in Pennsylvania with $500 in his pocket but steals a $5 sandwich. Caught, extradited to Texas and the rest is history. The catch is that the jury was asked to find him guilty or not guilty of murder – and no lesser charge. The defense claims that Durst killed Black in self-defense. The jury agreed. They couldn’t really take into account the actions of Durst after Black was killed only that he died as a result of an accident and it was not intentional. Talk about shock and surprise! Even Durst couldn’t believe it! How often does someone kill someone else, admit to killing them & dismembering the body and get away with it? I mean, I can see how he got off on technicality and to be quite honest, I almost think it was brilliant of his lawyers to take that gamble, but it was just that – a big gamble that ended up paying off.  Oh! And I learned a new term: BIN (booger in nose)

      Mom is going in for a hysterectomy today. About time, too! The only down side is that she won’t be able to do any lifting for about 6 weeks. I’m happy that she’s finally getting this done, but I wish I could be there anyway. I’m not sure if anyone has ever heard of exploding manhole covers. I had never heard of it until earlier this year and living in NYC, many (paranoid) people this it is terrorism related. It’s actually due to a buildup of steam or gas. I’ve never actually seen it happen, but I remember when they started exploding on 5th Avenue once. Today, they’re exploding in Queens, but not where I live. OK, so I’ve moved on to looking for Thanksgiving dinner recipes. I’ve printed out 2 different menus: A Simple Feast for a Small Gathering & Light and Healthy Thanksgiving Dinner. I think I’ll read over both and go with the one that looks least complicated.  Not sure if I ever revisited this piece, but a few days ago, I wrote that there is a new British Royal scandal that has been shrouded in mystery because no one is allowed to divulge any details. Well, the rumor around the mill is that Prince Charles might be bi-sexual or he had a bi-sexual affair with one of his former servants. Of course, this could all be BS and I think it is BS. I’ve been trying to read up on it and it seems that there are so many rumors floating around; seems like the press has been feeding the flames by printing “what ifs” boosting their sales. I just think its funny that there is another British Royal scandal, but no one knows what it is and yet there is all of this denial and lawsuits to block the press from printing it, etc. Crazy!! In other news, at least six Brazilian prisoners suffocated in a sewer after an attempted escape from the Sao Paulo State Penitentiary on Sunday afternoon, the state Security Secretariat said. In all, it is reported that 87 inmates tried to escape. They believe that there are another 7 prisoners who are dead, lost in the myriad of tunnels and pipes.  As part of my job here at Sentinel Real Estate Corp., I work on a fund called SB Partners. Many times people need to re-register an account or they sell their interest in the fund. When that happens and the original holder of the account is deceased, they must supply us with a copy of the death certificate. Interestingly enough, I always seem to find myself looking at the death certificate to see what they died of and how old they were. I got one the other day and the cause of death was “organic brain syndrome.” What? OK, so I’d never heard of this disorder so I turn to the Internet to answer all of my newfound questions. Turns out that this is just a generic term for the things that happen to your body as you get older or by definition “Organic brain syndrome is a general term which refers to physical disorders that cause a decrease in mental function, usually not including psychiatric disorders.”  Examples are degenerative disorders (Huntington’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, etc.), Cardiovascular disorders (stroke, etc.). OK, so the list actually goes on and on, but you get point. It’s basically anything that happens to you when you get old that decreases your mental capabilities. So, by request, on my death certificate, please have them put under cause of death “stopped breathing and she won’t wake up.” That should sum up the problem.  I found a very interesting website for all of you who have ever wondered: Where does my poop go? So check out the link below. It’s kind of a long read, but not too bad and you’ll probably have a few questions answered by the end of the article. Enjoy! http://www.portlandmercury.com/2002-12-24/feature.html  Oh, and thanks Becca! You made me blush a little! I'm very glad our family is so close and we can share in each others joys and sorrow and be there for each other. I love you and can't wait to see you in just over a month!!

      Cacky is safely back in Roxie, MS taking care of her aching and sore husband, John, who was in a car accident this past Saturday night. Luckily, he’s just sore and no more. We had a great time with Cacky during her trip. We went out to eat Friday night and then to an Irish pub for some live music where a homeless/bag man came inside to dance to the rhythm of the night. He made friends with some guys who bought him drinks. Of course, the more he drank, the more he kept trying to go on stage. The bar keep, James, finally had to tell him to either sit or get out. On Saturday, we hit the stores while Chris kept Jackson. Jackson scored 2 video games out of the deal. We were done with shopping around 4:30 pm and then went home to get ready for dinner & the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) later that night. Good times indeed! I’ll be adding the pictures under the Gallery 3 link on our homepage, but for some reason, I was having problems adding pictures this weekend. I’ll try again later.  As far as the stress meter is concerned, things are pretty shaky all around. Just when things seemed to be getting better, we’re hit with another curve ball. I’m hoping we can make it to the end of the game before one team calls forfeit and walks away. Only time will tell at this point.  I’ve been so busy today at work that I really haven’t had a chance to go full throttle at my blog today, so until tomorrow . . .

      This has been the longest 5 days in my entire life!! I’m so glad this week is over! I’m mentally drained from it all. OK, so no harping on the grief for now. I need to be in better spirits. I have a long night ahead of me. It’s harder for me to stay up late on Friday nights because I get up so early to get ready for work. I’m looking forward to that 2nd wind later today. Unfortunately, I won’t get off in time to go to the airport with Chris & Cindy to pick up Cacky. For now, the plans are to meet up around 7 pm at Cindy’s apartment. We’re going out to eat at a place called The Copper Kettle and then we’ll go to Tailor’s Hall for drinks afterwards. I’m sticking to my usual beer regiment so that I won’t puke all day long tomorrow. On Saturday, we’ll go shopping. We’ll end up at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater for a couple of shows later Saturday night. Can’t stay out too late Saturday because Chris has to be at work at 7 am Sunday.   A commuter’s tale: I was on the subway yesterday on my way home from work. The train was packed and I was standing, holding onto a bar. Whoever was driving the train must like to watch people jerk back and forth – that’s the conclusion most of us came to anyway. We were in the tunnel beneath the East River on our way to Queens when we suddenly jerked to a halt. At first, I was still standing and then someone started to fall. It was like this whole domino affect and the lady standing next to me was about 3 times my size. I think I hurt my right kidney. I later slammed into her when the train conduction jerked to a halt again just before Queensboro Plaza. Luckily, everyone was in a good mood and there were no words exchanged, which is a rarity here in the Big Apple.  I’m not even sure exactly what category this next bit falls into, but for weeks, newspapers have declared they know a dark rumor about the British royal family that could bring the monarchy down —but they could not print it because of Britain’s tight libel laws. The bomb finally looked set to go off this week, when the Mail said it was ready to print a 3,000-word scoop based on the testimony of an ex-royal servant — but was blocked at the last minute when another former servant sued. (courtesy of MSNBC.com) So there’s all of this brouhaha of what Prince Charles did, but denies doing, but no one will say what he did or didn’t do. Confusing!! And in Malaysia, the government will restrict the importation or publishing of books judged to be too scary because they could be a bad influence, a minister said. The restrictions would apply to books with elements of mystery, fantasy, the occult and superstition that were "calculated to entertain by frightening" the reader, Deputy Home Minister Chor Chee Heung was quoted as saying Thursday in The Star newspaper. "These materials will create an unhealthy picture on the minds of the readers, and influence them by such far-fetched ghostly stories," Chor was quoted as saying. Turns out that all media is high censored in Malaysia. (courtesy AP)

      Today is a brighter day in many ways! For one, it’s almost Friday, which means that Cacky will be here tomorrow! Chris is off work tomorrow & Saturday. I have a feeling that he’ll be sleeping most of the day tomorrow until we go pick Cacky up from the airport. I hear that the US Mint will be releasing an updated version of the nickel in 2006. The front will stay the same, but the backside will be one of two designs: a handshake or the Lois & Clark longboat. It’s about time the nickel got proper recognition.  On the web: There will be a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday. At the peak, the moon will hang in the night sky like a dark, reddish-orange coal. The eclipse reaches totality at 8:06 p.m. Saturday night, EST. That stage -- when the moon, Earth and sun are lined up precisely and the moon passes through the darkest part of Earth's shadow -- lasts just 24 minutes. (Courtesy of CNN.com) I just read an article about a new reality TV show titled “Can You Be A Porn Star?” with 28 women competing for $100,000 and a contract. It looks like you’ll only be able to watch the show via pay-per-view. It seems people will do anything to get on TV these days!  Weird but True (courtesy New York Post): Canadian biologists puzzled by a mysterious, underwater sound think it could be herrings farting.  “It sounds like a high-pitched raspberry,” said Ben Wilson of the University of British Columbia. Makes me wonder what goldfish sound like . . .

      Well, while things are still chaotic for now, but there is a silver lining and a glimmer of better days to come. All’s well that ends well, isn’t that how it goes? On the work front, Chris is tired working double shifts 5 days a week. I told him again last night (again) that if it’s too much on him, to quit one of the jobs before it starts taking its toll on him. On my job front, we get a pizza party today since they ran us ragged last week getting about 5 presentations out the door. I suddenly feel like I'm back in high school. And this Friday, Cacky is coming to visit for her birthday weekend!! Friday can’t get here fast enough!  Not too many things happening on the web today, but I did find the link below. It will connect you to some ridiculous but true lawsuits from over the years. It’s a quick read and you’ll probably laugh your bootie off or snort on a few of them.

      And the frustration continues. What good can I do from here? What good would I be if I were there? As it is, I feel like I’m chasing something that doesn’t want to be found to begin with; something that doesn’t want to see or talk to me. I find it strange and discomforting. It’s never quite been like this before. I know things are rough right now and will be rough for a while. Why do I feel like I need to help fix this situation? Human nature, I guess. I obviously can’t do a thing for anyone from here. So I’ve decided to call in some reinforcements. I need someone with more experience, more understanding with words of encouragement & Yaya wisdom. I need someone who has been in rough spots herself. And then all I can do is cut the cord, so to speak, and wait because that’s all I’m really allowed to do from here. Helplessness sucks. It would be so empowering to say that I’d NEVER allow myself to feel this way again, but let’s face it; I didn’t really have a choice in this matter to begin with. Why is it when we’re upset we shut everyone we love out of the picture? Why can’t I be in 2 places at once?  Alas, I cannot help heal the world when it wants to hurt and needs to hurt. All I can do is be here to help pick up the pieces when the time comes to move forward. God, please give us the strength and patience to get through the rough seasons of our lives.  So on a lighter note: In the news: The Defense Dept. has settled a lawsuit with Linda Tripp for $595,000 for a Privacy Act violation. The 1974 Privacy Act prohibits the government from releasing unauthorized personal information about individual Americans to nonfederal organizations. Lucky duck! In hopes of adding excitement to its patrons' nightlife, The Cutting Room, a bar in New York City, is mixing drinks with Nexcite, a Swedish import marketed as an herbal aphrodisiac. I’ll take some libido on the rocks, please! On Netscape.com, I read about 20 kooky ways to save money. Whoever wrote this article is obviously smoking crack.

      There are many things that happen to us in life that we simply don't understand. We don't know why we feel the way we do. We don't know why we look the way we do. Many times, people feel the need to "fix" what they feel is wrong in their lives. And while that isn't a bad thing, it sometimes turns out to be not quite as easy as we expected. Plan A doesn't quite work, but Plan B doesn't really work either. So in the end, you take part of Plan A and part of Plan B and you come up with Plan C. No one said Plan C would be easy. No one said Plan C would be completely pain free and happy and full of rainbows & kittens. Sometimes Plan C hurts and sometimes, it hurts a bit too much. In the end, it may not work at all even though it showed such promise in the beginning. In despair, we try to "fix" it once again. This time, we don't want people to know that Plans A, B, and C didn't work so we tell them everything is fine; "I'm still on Plan A! Everything is A-OK!" But what the masses don't know is that you've secretly been working on Plan D, which turns out worse than all the rest. Only this time, Plan D isn't an easy thing to let go or control. So the masses step in and try to help - try to "fix" things as well. Did they ask to help? Where were they when everything was going so wrong with Plan A and Plan B? Where were they then? How come they didn't put their two cents in when Plan C was in motion? It pisses you off; makes you angry. How dare they try to fix what they don't know! Who said they have the right? But, who says they don't?  At what point in your life and your troubles do you realize that what you've been doing isn't working anymore? What makes that realization an easy one? Where is the guidebook of life that's supposed to explain everything and make this world happy and beautiful once again? Geez! So many questions and so few answers do I have beating down my door. I just want to stand up and scream ENOUGH!! I'M DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT! IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, JUST F**KING SAY IT ALREADY! But then I come back down to reality and I realize that that won't really do anyone any good anyway. Where is my magic wand? Who borrowed it? I want it back! I want puppies and ice cream and rainbows again. I want picnics at that spot on Hwy 165. I want coke floats and to chase butterflies at dusk with a net I made out of an old shirt and a wire clothes hanger. I want to listen to Kenny Rogers in that big ugly brown van again. I want to go skinny-dipping with that boy down the street trying to catch a peek at us doing cartwheels off the side of the pool. I want to go fishing again in the woods behind Mr. Witty's place. I want to go back to Gulf Shores and watch the sun set and then rise and then set again. I want to eat dill pickles at basketball games in that old gym and then sneak back into the music room while no one is watching us. I want to sneak out at night and go into the circle and sit under that tree until we get chilly again. I want to stand in the sand in the Red River while my toes disappear. I want to make slightly pornographic mud pies on the bottom of my red wagon again.  If life were this simple, we would still be 10 years old and riding our bicycles everywhere. Why were in such a hurry to grow up? Make things our own? All I can do now is to make my life what I see in my daydreams. To make life as fun and exciting for my nieces and nephews as it was for me. This is what I have to promise myself. To get myself through the day; through the week; through the month; through the year. Through my life that is now, well, my life. I want to make life fun again and if I can't wave my magic wand and be 10 again, then I can make life fun for them again. That's what matters anyway, right?

      Drama. Not too much drama, but enough to hurt your stomach a little; that’s how my weekend ended and my week started. If I could, I would wave a magic wand and all would be right & good in the world. As it is, I can only sit on my hands, make phone calls (wait for them to call me back) and pray that all will be OK in the end. Even though I’ve been calling to try to help, I think I’m just adding to the stress of the situation. I hate being so far away during these tough times. If only I were rich enough to take off for about a month to help out. Perhaps in my next life . . . And yet I feel so helpless even though I know there’s pretty much nothing I can do from here. I’m frustrated, very, very frustrated.  On a livelier front, Cacky will be coming in this Friday for her birthday weekend in NYC! We have a few activities planned, but nothing too major as Chris will have to go to work early Sunday morning (7 am). We have plans to go out to dinner, an Irish pub, shopping and, of course, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. Everything else is pretty much up in the air.  I would write more, but I’m afraid I’m a bit preoccupied and can’t seem to grab hold of a complete thought, so let’s just make comments on today’s news! I’m sure by now everyone has heard about the California lawyer who was shot at point blank like 5 times. Amazing video! Talk about a disgruntled client! On Sunday, I watched Sean “P Diddy” Combs run the NYC marathon. He ended up raising over $2 million for NYC schools so I can’t really shoot down his efforts as just another publicity stunt. In truth, I like P Diddy – his music and most other of his business ventures. He seems like a stand up guy anyway. And in case you haven’t heard, Minnie Driver (the actress) is planning to work in a Cambodian sweatshop in order to help improve working conditions and pay for people in poor countries. She’s planning to bring a photographer along and they’re hoping to make a documentary or write a book about the ordeal. OK, so now I have to question whether she’s doing this for poor people or poor Minnie.  In case anyone would like more blogs to read, there is one (www.bigwhiteguy.com) in which this Canadian white male who is now living in Hong Kong recounts his adventures of living in a city where the “tax rate is unbeatable” and he sees “things most people on dream of seeing.” This site was featured on CNN and is good to read in case you just don’t have enough to fill your day. Yes, I say live vicariously through the Big White Guy!! Why not? It’s cheaper than going there yourself! Ok, now off to order Chinese food from Chef Ho Dumpling House!!

      Wow! We saw it all last night, I think! We went to a Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden, which was the 1st time any of us had been to MSG. We had a great time but you should have heard some of the comments as we walked through the Times Square subway station on our way to the concert. Chris was a Redneck Alien Trucker and Olivia & I were Angel Sluts. Don't know if that's what we had in mind when we picked out our costumes, but that's what we ended up with. Check out the pictures in Gallery 3 - we saw: a glow worm, cheerleaders, fairies, butterflies, girls scouts, scooby-doo, 80's man, princesses, the Pope, Hawaiian girls (I mean, men), chicken man, the gingerbread man, candy corn, walking Christmas trees, Goth girls, Austin Powers, devils, cat women, stop light girl, TV man, etc. You name it, we probably saw it! Including the guy I spotted in nothing but a speedo. Thankfully, that one wasn't too close to where we were sitting! At one point, I went to the bathroom & Chris went to get beer. I come back from the bathroom & Chris is standing up there placing his order while some girl is trying to kiss him. She liked his Alien Redneck Trucker teeth.  My wings broke just before the end of the concert, but I think I can repair them. My feet were hurting so bad by the end of the night & we ended up walking like 10 blocks from 33rd Street to 42nd Street trying to catch a cab. Never found one! We ended up squeezing onto the 7 train at Bryant Park and taking it into Queens and transferred to the N train. Got home just before 2 am. All in all, good times all around! OK, off to soak my aching feet! And to store my wig & wings until they're needed once more in this City of Dreams.

      I started thinking about the movie Fight Club after an earlier conversation with a co-worker. Then I started thinking about what a Single Serving Friend is. Then I thought about my latest Single Serving Friend. Ernest, I think his name was. I met him on the flight from Atlanta, GA to Alexandria, La. He was going to Natchitoches, coincidentally, to see his daughter, Erica (we'll call her), for her 18th birthday. He began telling me how she didn't finish high school and quit in like either the 9th grade or 11th grade. She now works for a small local fast food joint. My new friend, Ernest, has been trying to convince his daughter to come visit him and his family in either Boston or Germany. A little history: Ernest and this woman were never married and he is now remarried and living in Boston. His new wife is German and they go back to Germany occasionally. Anyway, I was telling him how I'm glad that I got out of Natchitoches for a bit. Even if I eventually ended up there, life is certainly worth the experiences. You can always go back home, but some opportunities won't wait on you.   So I told Ernest how I thought leaving was one of the best things I ever did. Not the easiest, but it has helped my grow in these 2 1/2 short years that I've been here. I certainly enjoy going home and I certainly wish I could be there more often for all of the little things, but what can I do really. I go home as much as I absolutely can. I enjoy every minute of it because I know I have to tell them all goodbye at the airport. Airports make me cry. I'm usually teary-eyed for the first leg of the trip, which is only an hour long. But it's a new year (almost) and new vacation days are coming - except the ones that I "borrowed" to go home for Christmas.  By the way, New Year's is tomorrow night. I am not going to Times Square in case you were wondering. And I know you were. Last year, Chris's parent were here, so it was fun to go out. This year, Chris is working and Cindy has a date. Dick Clark, here I come baby!! It's you and me this year! If I can stay awake that long.

      I watched the Michael Jackson interview where he said that he was manhandled by the police, etc. What can I say really but, ARE YOU CRACKED OUT MICHAEL?!?!? Jeez! I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but the dumbass is lying.  Interestingly enough, M&Ms will phase out color in 2004. The company says that this is an effort to turn over a new leaf and gain market share. In early 2004, the only colors available will be black and white. They will then run a contest 4 or 5 months later reminiscent of the golden ticket from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." They will produce 6 bags of colored M&Ms - all candies in each of the 6 bags will be the same color. One bag each for: yellow, orange, red, green, blue, and brown. Click  urlLink here  to read.  I read an article on Time.com about whether or not the draft should be reinstated. The thing is, with the attacks on the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon, Chris and I had to sit down and have a serious talk about the goings on up here in NYC. At that time, there were many anthrax threats as well as the possibility of smallpox or something like that. I forget now that it's 2 years later.  In the news: Tammy Faye Messner, the ex-wife of televangelist Jim Bakker, says she may pick up some tips on make-up from the male transvestites she'll appear with this Friday. The former Tammy Faye Bakker will host Drag Bingo in Durham , to raise money for the Alliance of AIDS Services Carolina. (courtesy  urlLink WNBC.com )

      So my efforts at trying to post each day of my Christmas vacation failed miserably. Sucks for you, kid. All in all, good times indeed! Indeed. As reported, I held an alligator for the very first time in my life. Not so bad. My flights went well and during my 2 hour layover in Atlanta on the way back, I had an appointment with an endless bowl of chips & salsa from Chili's and a Corona. I ended up buying myself a silver band for my thumb. Momma likes. It was a WONDERFUL Christmas vacation!! I, however, have come to the realization that I cannot spend a holiday as important as Christmas away from Chris.  I've been so out of the loop in the news world that I didn't even know there was an earthquake in Iran or mudslides in Utah, etc. In truth, I couldn't figure out how to work my Dad's satellite TV. I must admit that I'm a little ashamed of myself, too. I'm surrounded by technology and I can't figure out how to watch my favorite channels on satellite. Dumbass.  I found this interesting little website of  urlLink found notes . Neat site. You should visit. And then I found another site for someone who decided to take the whole cell phone matter into his own hands by " urlLink rearranging " it.  And this next one is just about the scariest thing I think I've ever seen.  urlLink Ugly sweaters, really fast .   And for all of you with time on your hands: the  urlLink Michael Jackson  game. OK, so it's kind of lame, but you're the one who's bored. Not me.

      This week has gone by all too quickly and yet I can't wait to get home to see my husband and sleep in my own bed! I've had a great visit back in Louisiana. Santa was good to all! I have 2 nephews here in Natchitoches: 2 1/2 years old & 10 months old. I don't understand how my sister still has an ounce of sanity left in her body. My sister-in-law has 3: 5 years old, 3 years old & a 1 year old - all girls. I don't know how they do it! At times, I feel like I'm ready to have kids until I come to visit some of my nieces & nephews. Then I feel like waiting for another 10 years. They're exhausting, but I love them all! Today, we went out to Campti & Coushatta to see some of my aunts, uncles and cousins. It was so nice when the boys fell asleep in the car on the way back! Well, I guess I'm off again since my sister and her husband just came in. Time for more coffee and some awesome carrot cake made my very own loving mother!! Oh! And we had fried turkey yesterday for Christmas dinner! AWESOME!!

      Ok, so I've been home for about 2 1/2 days and I'm just now able to post. It's been busy so far. I can't comment on any news this time around as I haven't stopped long enough to watch anything on TV. As soon as I landed in Alexandria, La on Saturday, we ate at Cracker Barrel. Then, we drove to Rayville to go see my grandparents and my in-laws. We did a little present swapping, ate some good ole deep-fried chicken and then watched the Blue Collar Comedy Tour starring Jeff Foxworthy. Too funny! My sister-in-law, Cacky, recorded it from Comedy Central one night. Good work, Cacky dahlin, good work! I got all kinds of good stuff for Christmas already and it's only the 22nd!! I just want to point out that I haven't even worn my coat since I landed. It's been in the 50's or 60's during the day. Crazy!! Oh! And I held a couple of alligators just about an hour ago. I took a picture with them, too! Their snouts were taped shut so they wouldn't bite anyone. My little nephew, Bryant, was a little scared of them but he stuck it out for the pics.  This morning, Mom, Dad & I got in the car to go to Shreveport for a little shopping. The car didn't want to start, but Dad coaxed it and it came to life. We took it back to the dealership since they've only had it about a month. Turns out that a rat crawled up in the engine and tried making a nest. It chewed through a few wires, which had to be replaced. Ended up costing about $130 plus tax. And about 2 hours of our time. However, I must say that Moffit Mazda is just the nicest car dealership you could possibly pick. Alright, Dad's making some cheese toast which happens to be an old favorite of mine, so I gotta go. Until next time . . .

      Sorry, boys & girls, for the lag in posts, but we've been dealing with a family situation. I haven't really been surfing the net lately. I haven't really been able to concentrate on one thing. However, Chris and I did manage to clean out our closets last night. Instead of sharing the closets, we've decided that we would each have one closet each to ourselves. I think we're officially a married couple now. For the most part, even though we've been married for over a year (and living together for about 5 years before that), it still feels like we're roommates. But, things are beginning to move toward the other spectrum.   Chris flew out to Louisiana this morning for a funeral. He'll be back in the Big Apple Friday afternoon. We'll have Friday night together and then I fly to Louisiana on Saturday morning for a little Christmas vacation with my family. I'll try to post from there, but if I miss a day or two, we'll all somehow survive, I'm sure. I plan on getting my hair cut and add more blond highlights while I'm down there. It's just cheaper, damn it. It amazes me that quite a few women that I work with spend about $150 on their hair each time they go. And they go very regularly - about every 8 to 10 weeks. Insane!  I've nearly finished my Christmas shopping and I'm very proud of myself, if not a little astonished by my power-shopping ability. If I don't finish buying gifts up here, then I'll have to finish shopping at my old buddy: Pecanland Mall in Monroe, La. I used to work at Deck the Walls (picture frame shop) when I first started college. Great times!! Pecanland has always been good to me. Last time I was home, my mother-in-law (Daisie, we'll call her) and I went through like 6 stores in less than an hour. We're animals! But I must confess, I really can't keep up with her when she's going full steam for some long-term shopping. I don't know how she does it. My Mom used to be the same way. I just haven't shopped with her lately, so I don't know if she's slowed down any yet.   Must send a big shout out to COURT as I was mentioned on her blog the other day. You should definitely read her blog along with the others that I have linked to the right of this post. I wouldn't waste your time. I promise. As a matter of fact, I was inspired in some way or another by each one.  Wow! I've just discovered that you can actually bid on eBay for your very own  urlLink Imaginary Online Girlfriend . What the f*ck?!?The bids range from $3 to $50. I wonder how much I would pull in?   And I'm sure you've heard that:  urlLink MIT SCIENTIST PENS WORLD'S LARGEST BOOK BY FAR  (courtesy Foxnews.com) A 133-pound tome about the Asian country of Bhutan that uses enough paper to cover a football field and a gallon of ink has been declared the world's largest published book. Author Michael Hawley, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it's not a book to curl up with at bedtime Ã‚Â— "unless you plan to sleep on it." Each copy of "Bhutan: A Visual Odyssey Across the Kingdom," is 5-by-7 feet, 112 pages and costs about $2,000 to produce. Hawley is charging $10,000 to be donated to a charity he founded, Friendly Planet, which has built schools in Cambodia and Bhutan.

      It snowed again today! Of course I decided that I needed to get some shopping done today, so I trekked 15 blocks in the wind and snow down to Steinway Street to buy clothes for my nephews for midnight Mass, which happens to be at 10 pm this year. Huh? Oh well, more important things to ponder these days. Ok, so after the clothes for the boys, I then decided they needed shoes. Cowboy boots for Bryant it is then. Alright, so I trekked the 15 blocks back to my apartment to meet Cindy and Jackson. They were only here for about 30 minutes before Chris called me. "Please don't hate me," he says, "but I left my resignation letter for the Westin at home and I need you to bring it to me. By the way, did you know it was snowing?" OK, so at 3 pm, Cindy & Jackson scooted off and I headed into the city, dropped off the letter, stole a kiss from my man and then hopped on the 7 train and went to Amanda's to help with her holiday cookies. Home by 7 pm to watch WWE Armageddon. Busy day.  Tomorrow is our company's holiday party. I usually end up drinking a bit too much wine at this thing and then dancing my socks off. I plan to stick to beer this year in the hopes of no hangover!! Wish me luck! There's always an after party, which I have yet to make it to. The bad thing about this whole deal is that we have to go to work the next day. Half show up and out of those half, they show up late. I'm surprised they show up at all.  In case I don't get to post tomorrow, I would like to say:    HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD!!          I'm going home to Louisiana this Saturday for a whole week! I'm pretty excited, but I'm exhasted thinking of all the things that still need to get done before I leave. And, I still need to finish getting 11 more Christmas gifts. I'm sure I'll be having a Bloody Mary just as soon as they pull out the beverage cart on the 8 am flight to Atlanta from NYC. By the end of the week, I'll have deserved it twice-fold. Before I hit the publish button, I just wanted to say:   THEY CAPTURED SADDAM HUSSEIN!! FINALLY!!  GO USA!

      Wow! There really isn’t jack shit happening in the news world so far today. Well, a few things, but nothing I’d like to comment on. However, last night, I found the link so that you, too, can get your  urlLink 2004 Horoscope ! Lucky you! So go and find out what the New Year has in store for you!  The 12-year-old boy who accidentally killed a 6-year-old girl three years ago will finally get a new trial. I’m sure you remember this one. His defense said that it was an accident as the boy, Lionel Tate, was trying to mimic wrestling moves he’d seen on TV. He was tried as an adult, found guilty, and has served 3 years of a life sentence without parole. Personally, I don’t think he should have been tried as an adult in the first place and, luckily, they’ll now give him a new trial because the court failed to evaluate his competency before the first trial. Good for him! I just think he really didn’t mean to kill that little girl and he had no idea he could hurt her that bad. Kids that age have no idea what mortality is and all the like. I can’t believe that his attorneys let him be tried as an adult in the first place.  I got a call from my former boss, Walter LaRose, this morning so I wanted to give a shout out to all of my friends in MONROE, LOUISIANA!!

      So yesterday started off a little rough and it ended about the same. After work, I walked the 1 block to the train station, swiped my card, hopped onto the N train that had just pulled into the station when an announcement came over the system: “Due to an earlier stalled train, the N and W trains may or may not be running into Queens. We won’t know anything until we pull into 57th Street. To get to Astoria, Queens, take the downtown train to 42nd Street/Times Square and take the 7 train to Queensboro Plaza and then transfer to the N or W train.” Ok, all well and good except that we sat there for about 10 minutes before everyone started going upstairs, crossed the street, back downstairs to wait on the downtown train platform. I, on the other hand, seized the opportunity to do a little shopping, as I needed to find a pair of pants for our company holiday party. So I did my thing and walked away with 1 pair of black pants with a nice ribbon detail and 1 glittery pink shirt that I’ll probably exchange as I now have pink glitter all over me, still. After my shopping, I went back to the train station on the downtown side. No train. I then walked to Times Square (about 8 blocks) and took the 7 train to Queens. I got to Queensboro Plaza and they announced that all trains were arriving and departing from the upper level to go back into Astoria. Happy, happy, yeah, yeah as I was already on the upper level. Then, to everyone’s chagrin, a train pulled into the lower level and an announcement came over the system, “The train on the lower level will be going back into Astoria.” So hundreds of people were trying to make their way downstairs to get onto the Astoria bound train only to have the train conductor then tell everyone that the next stop on that train was Lexington & 59th Street in Manhattan. Well, F**k that!! Since there were no other trains in sight, I walked home from there, which took me about 10 minutes in my boots. Finally! Home at last!!  OK, then it was time to get on the phone with Verizon’s tech support to try to figure out why we haven’t been able to get online since Saturday. Well, 45 minutes into the call and catching a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel, I got a beep on my phone. It’s Chris, so I flipped over to let him know that I was working with Verizon on our little problem. Oops! I hung up on both Chris and Verizon!!! Son of a B**tch! So I called Verizon back and 30 minutes later, we had Internet!! It was all the router’s fault. Damn router.  And scene.  There is a story on MSNBC.com about an order from the Pentagon barring those nations that were opposed to the Iraq war from bidding on reconstruction contracts in Iraq. I must say that I can both sides of the argument. On the one hand, why should those countries who adamantly opposed the war and who did everything they could to stop it be awarded contracts when they haven’t done the prep work that enables them to safely go into Iraq to rebuild. However, on the other hand, the US doesn’t own Iraq. Who’s to say the Pentagon should get to decide which countries are allowed to bid on contracts. Shouldn’t an order like this technically come from the UN? I’m afraid it all comes down to greed. Luckily, I don’t have to deal directly with this stuff, so I can keep my petty little comments in my blog and the world will be a happier place indeed.

      Before I get into all of the lousy details of my day, let me first say:   HAPPY 29TH BIRTHDAY BOB!!!   Ok, so now I can tell you that I’ve had a hell of night and morning. It started at 12:15 am when Chris came home, dropped his bag off and went upstairs to Sergio’s apartment. Berg meowed at the door for the next 20 minutes. I screamed only 3 times, I think, from the warmth of my bed to SHUT THE HELL UP BERG!! Later, Chris’s alarm starts going off at 4:15 am, which is normal but I’m in such a rotten mood already that I can’t go back to sleep before the alarm goes off again 10 minutes later and then 10 minutes after that. Finally, he gets up at 5 am – again, this is normal. At about 5:25 am, it sounds like someone is hitting our radiator violently with a hammer. While some faint banging is a normal (occasional) occurrence, this sound was very loud. I nearly jumped out of bed. Within 5 minutes, our neighbor, Ms. Gertie, started knocking on all of the doors on the 1st floor to let everyone know that she didn’t have electricity. I finally lay back down only to have to get up to my own alarm at 6 am. Much to my dismay, the lack of Ms. Gertie’s electricity wasn’t the only problem our building was having: no heat and no hot water. Ah, a barely luke-warm shower it is then. Then it’s finally time for my morning cup of coffee only to go cold on me quicker than normal due to our freezing cold apartment. New York City! Ain’t it the life?!?  I just read on MSNBC.com that Ozzy Osbourne had to have emergency surgery after an ATV accident. You can read the story  urlLink here .    Now, what we’ve all been holding our breathes for, the facts on the paper vs. plastic bag saga:  Convenient and Everywhere    Plastic bags were first introduced in 1977 and now account for four out of every five bags handed out at grocery stores.  Americans make 2.3 trips to the grocery store each week. If people use five to 10 bags each time, that's between 600 and 1,200 bags per person per year.   Stores usually pay less than a penny per plastic shopping bag, and 3 to 4 cents per paper shopping bag.   According to the Grocery Industry Committee on Solid Waste, less than 1 percent of shoppers consistently use cloth shopping bags.    Paper or Plastic? You Decide.    Plastic grocery bags consume 40 percent less energy to produce and generate 80 percent less solid waste than paper bags.   Plastic bags can take 5-10 years to decompose. Paper bags take about a month to decompose.   Paper bags are made from trees, which are a renewable resource. Most plastic bags are made from polyethylene, which is made from petroleum, a nonrenewable resource.   Two thousand plastic bags weigh 30 pounds, 2,000 paper bags weigh 280 pounds.   A packed standard-sized paper bag can hold up to 14 items, an average plastic bag often holds 5-10 items.  Research from 2000 shows 20 percent of paper bags were recycled, while 1 percent of plastic bags were recycled. But plastic bag recycling is growing as plastic lumber products become more popular.

      All in all, not a bad weekend. My calves and my right arm still hurt a bit, but they’re getting better. I think I’m weathering falls down stairs better these days. On Friday night, Chris and I braved the snow and 35+ mph winds to go watch The Last Samaria starring Tom Cruise. Excellent movie and I would definitely recommend it to everyone! I made chili this weekend – perfect timing, I think. We had it 3 ways: with cornbread, with cracker, and with Frito Lay corn chips all topped with shredded cheese. Just right, kid, just right.  During filming in a remote area of Italy earlier this year for the controversial Mel Gibson film "The Passion of Christ," the actor who portrays Jesus was struck during a lightning storm, according to an October report in the trade paper Variety.  Also struck was assistant director Jan Michelini, who had been struck by lightning at a previous shoot for the film, in Matera, Italy.  None of the strikes created a serious injury.  The film's portrayals of Christ and of Jews are expected to make it extremely controversial. (courtesy MSNBC.com’s Weird News) I really wanted to see this movie, but after these lightening strikes, I think someone up there might be trying to tell us something about this movie.

      Well, we've just finished moving Sergio from Brooklyn to Queens in the 1st blizzard of 2003. He's moving into the apartment directly above ours. It wasn't too bad as long as you're ready for it. A few layers of clothes and some snow goggles and we're all set, thanks. Our living room radiator is popping and clicking right now. We would normally have it turned off, but it's been a little too cold lately.  Today is the NATCHITOCHES CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL!!! I wish I were there! I hope someone had a funnel cake for me! Mom & Dad opted out of the festival to go Christmas shopping in Shreveport.  Ok, off to take a muscle relaxer and melt into the couch. I didn't overdo the moving until I slipped down the stairs while loading Sergio's things into the new apartment. I didn't fall all the way down since I was hanging from the banister with one arm. Ok, off to melt now.

      They’re predicting 4 to 7 inches of snow here in the city over the next day and a half. Should be interesting to help Sergio move his stuff from Brooklyn to Queens in the snow. They said that it wouldn’t snow until later this evening, but it’s already coming down pretty good. Well, the flu is really kicking some ass this year! I would say that I’m glad I’ve already had my flu shot, but the strain of influenza that is killing people out there isn’t contained in the flu shot they’re handing out. Great! I got that stupid shot for nothing! All that anxiety!  There is a story out of Lafayette, La. about a little boy who received disciplinary action from his school. The mother received a call from her son’s school informing her that he had used foul words. Once she saw the disciplinary form, she got upset because he hadn’t used curse words but told another student what “gay” meant. His own mother is gay and he was explaining what it all meant. The boy was scolded in front of his class, sent to the principal's office, banned from recess and ordered to attend "behavior clinic" after his conversation with the kid. The school says that it is all a misunderstanding and that he’s not being punished for discussing what it is to be gay, but because he was off task from the students’ lesson. Now, the ACLU is involved and is threatening the school with a lawsuit. OK, in my school days, nearly every kid was off task at some point or another. I have a hard time believing that behavior clinic attendance should be required if the issue is simply being off task. Someone’s blowing smoke.  A man in Queens was issued a ticket for too much noise when his son’s balloon popped on the sidewalk. How insane is that? The man says that he’ll fight the ticket in court. I’m afraid I’m on this man’s side on this one.

      So far, today has been a good day. It’s butt-ass cold outside, but what’s new? Chris doesn’t have to work tomorrow and I’m looking forward to his alarm not going off at 4:15 am. On Saturday, we’ll be helping his friend, Sergio, move from Brooklyn to the apartment directly above ours. Should be an interesting arrangement as long as I don’t hear any strange sounds from above.  OK, so I’ve watched Fox’s “The Simple Life” starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie for the last 2 nights. I think my jaw hit the ground after last night’s episode. Their host family secured them jobs at a dairy farm. Now, this is their very first job in their entire lives and they’re going to work on a farm. I knew things would go wrong when they showed up an hour late and Paris carried her Louis Vuitton bag with her to milk the cows. At the end of their workday, they were supposed to fill all of these bottles with milk and seal them for the delivery truck that was on its way. After the owner walked away to tend to other matter, they proceeded to hide half of the empty bottles they were to fill and then they: spilled about half of the milk, added water to some bottles, got dirt in a few, etc. They then disappeared into the dairy farm owner’s home to sleep on his couch. Once he found them, he gently said that he would do better by himself, paid them each $42 for what little they worked and wished them the best in life. I have to hand it to the dairy farm owner because I would have cussed them to no end and then kicked them in their pampered asses. I must say that I thought they would have done better as far as jobs go. Next week’s episode has them working at Sonic where they proceed to put up naughty words on the marquee and then flip off passers by while wearing Sonic food costumes. We’ll see what happens next week.  I’ve also been watching MTV’s “Rich Girls” starring Ally Hilfiger and Jamie Gliecher which, at times, can be just as jaw dropping when you see all of the things they do or can’t do. For instance, if I’m not mistaken, Jamie has someone do her makeup every morning. On the episode I watched last night, Ally was whining and crying to her dad about her childhood and then because she wants to be able to stand on her own 2 feet without her parents help. She then goes grocery shopping for ingredients to make nachos, but has to ask various people in the store what goes on them or what type of cheese to use. I must say that one thing I’ve noticed about these über rich people is that they lie around and nap a lot!  In today’s paper: Five high school students pleaded not guilty yesterday to robbery charges stemming from a monthlong crime spree in which they posed first as female prostitutes and then undercover cops, to rip people off.

      Ok, it’s a long one today because I went home last night and found some interesting things on the Internet, but first, I’d like to make a correction to yesterday’s post. “A Simple Life” starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie is not an MTV production, nor is it showing on MTV. It is showing on the Fox Channel, though it is by the same creators as MTV’s The Real World, Road Rules, etc.  Glow-in-the-Dark pet fish coming soon: The nation's first genetically altered household pet -- a fish that glows in the dark -- is set to begin appearing in stores next month everywhere except perhaps California, the only state with a ban on lab-engineered species. I’m tempted to get one of these fish just to see it glow in the dark, but I’m also afraid that Berg will make a quick dinner out of him regardless of how much it cost me.  An Australian launched the latest accessory for pampered pooches Tuesday -- bottled water in flavors like chicken and corn, liver and bacon, or beef. The purified Dog Plus K-9 water went on sale in pet stores at $2.10 for 1.3 pint plastic bottle. "It's like a sports drink for dogs," said Andrew Larkey who thought up the idea. "Dogs get bored with plain water -- they deserve variety just as much as people."  Larkey plans a similar line of drinks for cats, in roast chicken and pork flavors early next year. People can safely drink it as well, he said, but it probably won't be a hit with humans. "I've actually developed a bit of a taste for it myself, but I think most people's first reaction is to be a little suspicious," he said. He said each bottle also contains half a dog's recommended daily intake of vitamins B1, B3, B5, B6 and C. (courtesy AP newswire) Huh? I would ask who might be crazy enough to buy this BS, but I have a feeling people I actually know might buy this stuff. Scary, kids. Scary.  A new study revealed the U.S. rate of teenage births fell a staggering 31 percent from 1991 to 2002. The rate declined from 62 births per 1,000 girls to 43 per 1,000. The study also contained some revelations on regional and racial differences regarding teenage sexuality and motherhood. New Hampshire had the nation's lowest teen birth rate in 2001, with 21 births per 1,000 girls between ages 15 and 19. The worst was Mississippi, with a teen birth rate more than three times higher, at 67 per 1,000. Interestingly, of the 11 states with the top teen birth rates, all but New Mexico require that abstinence be stressed in sex education. In all, 22 states have such laws. Overall, Southern and Southeastern states had the highest teen birth rates, while New England states, except Rhode Island, had five of the six lowest rates. Other findings included a marked racial difference as to whether girls and boys were equally likely to have sex early in life. Among teens who had sex before age 15, white girls were just as likely as boys to have sex. But black or Hispanic girls were less than half as likely as black or Hispanic males to do so. Hispanics had the highest teen birth rates, with nearly three times more than the 30 per 1,000 reported for whites. (courtesy NYPost.com)  FOOD FACTS & FICTIONS (courtesy NYPost.com) Just in time for the holiday season of stuffing your face!  MYTH: If you eat late at night, the food turns straight into fat.  FACT: It's how many calories you eat - not when you eat them - that counts. MYTH: Foods like grapefruit, celery or ice-cold water can burn fat and calories.  FACT: No food can burn fat. (If only!) MYTH: Raw vegetables are better than cooked.  FACT: Cooking carrots and tomatoes helps to release cancer-fighting substances called carotenoids and lycopenes, so the body can absorb them more easily.  In fact, packaged, heat-processed tomato products such as spaghetti sauce can deliver six times more lycopene than the equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes, according to the American Dietetic Association.  What's more, some beans such as red kidney beans contain natural toxins, which can cause diarrhea if the beans aren't cooked properly. Boiling them for 20 minutes makes the food safe to eat.  MYTH: Boiling vegetables is better than microwaving them.  FACT: The longer you cook your food, the more nutrients it can lose. MYTH: Cravings are your body's way of telling you it needs something.  FACT: You wish.  Chances are, you're craving the pleasure and comfort you feel when you eat those foods - not a specific nutrient in them. MYTH: Any type of water is always better than soda.  FACT: Although regular water is calorie-free, some trendy vitamin waters contain as many as 100 to 125 calories per bottle.  Keep in mind that a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola carries 140 calories.  MYTH: Food labeled low-carb means it's healthy.  FACT: Check the label: There's no governmental standard for low-carb the way there is for low-fat or organic, and even if a product touts that it's low in carbs, it may be packing in the calories. MYTH: Vegetarian meals are healthier than meat dishes.  FACT: To compensate for lack of flavor, some meat-free dishes are loaded with sodium, fat and calories. MYTH: Nuts are evil and should be avoided if you want to lose weight.  FACT: Although nuts are high in calories and fat, most varieties have low amounts of saturated fat, which is linked to an increased risk of heart disease.  They're also a good source of protein and have no cholesterol.  Lingerie becomes anti-drug weapon: They have tried aerial assaults and stiff jail sentences. Now Colombian officials have a new and unlikely weapon to combat the cocaine trade: push-up bras and thongs. Some 900 peasant women in Colombia are set to make racy lingerie and sell it to French supermarket chain Carrefour under a U.N.-backed program aimed at encouraging impoverished farmers and their families to stop growing drug crops. (courtesy MSNBC.com) I wonder if they get to keep any of the articles that they make? But then their problem might not be drugs but birth control. Oh well.

      It’s another beautiful December day! Olivia, who I work with, baked a cartload of sweets and brought half of it to the office. She even placed them in individual cellophane wrappers. And everything is wonderful! But she says that she’s done with her baking until Valentine’s Day. She made brownies, biscotti, cookies, candies . . . Amazing!!  “The Simple Life,” an MTV reality show featuring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie is set to debut tonight. The show is about these 2 rich and somewhat spoiled girls being dropped in the middle of rural Arkansas to live with a family. In the beginning, I don’t think the girls are told exactly what their living conditions will be. I think it’ll be fun to watch them adjust and to see some of their reactions to being asked to pluck a chicken or “checking” the cows. I know most people know what this means, but if not, it involves one of your arms, a long plastic sleeve to slip your arm into, and a cow’s rectum. Good times!  And for all the men in our lives: DaimlerChrysler's Dodge unit is sponsoring a pay-per-view "Lingerie Bowl" during halftime of the Super Bowl on Feb. 1 featuring models dressed in lingerie playing a seven-on-seven tackle football game. The show will cost viewers $30. The teams will be coached by former NFL stars Lawrence Taylor and Eric Dickerson. (courtesy CNN.com)  P.S. IT’S SNOWING AGAIN!!!! Flurries all week and nothing sticks, but IT’S SNOWING AGAIN!! OK, it quit snowing.

      December 1st – what a lovely day! Well, kind of. It started off sunny and bright and then turned strangely overcast and gray. Now it is just cloudy and looks like it might rain later.  Ideally, it’s time to do some holiday shopping but it looks like I’ll have to wait until when (or if) I receive a holiday bonus. And if it happens like last year, that means that I’ll have a whopping 2 days to shop before I have to stuff it all in my luggage and hop on the plane bound for the South. I think I’m up to the challenge as long as I’m not sick during those 2 days. I recall a mere 2 years ago when I received my holiday bonus. As soon as I got off work, I hopped on a downtown train and picked up my wedding dress & tiara from the shop. I remember carrying it back onto the train and getting somewhat strange looks. I guess most people would have taken a taxi home that day, but what can I say? I was broke – I’d just spent every last penny I had on that dress. I think it’s balled up in some room at Mom’s house now. And since the wedding is now just a memory, I’ve decided on a new use for my tiara: I will wear it on each birthday from here on out (once I get it back from Mom & Dad’s house). If only I had it today . . .  Ok, not much happening in the news, but I pulled this from the web word for word, so don’t go charging me with plagerism: A particularly curious statement by U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s at a press briefing won him an unexpected honor on Monday. Rumsfeld, usually renowned for his uncompromising tough talking, was awarded the “Foot in Mouth” award for a baffling message which probably left his audience in the dark, Britain’s Plain English Campaign said. “Reports that say something hasn’t happened are interesting to me, because as we know, there are known unknowns; there things we know we know,” Rumsfeld told the briefing. “We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know.” (courtesy MSNBC.com)

      Last night, some girls from work & I went to eat at Noche for Restaurant Week. [Sidenote: Restaurant Week is a week (or in this case, 2 weeks) when many of NYC's top restaurants offer fantastic meals for a low price. Since it is now 2004, the lunch price is $20.04. Last year (2003), the price was $20.03.]  So, we go to Noche and have a lovely time. The food was OK; nothing to write home about. The place itself was spectacular and the service was fantastic! Pretty good time. Then, 3 of us (Abigail, Olivia & me) went to a farewell party for another co-worker at a bar/restaurant called Eamon's on 45th Street. Cozy little spot - very nice. I did a shot jagermeister, which I haven't done since about my senior year in high school. It tastes as awful as I can remember. Funny, when I took the shot, I remembered sitting around the kitchen table at Allison O'Con's in Natchitoches with a few other girls. We were all standing around taking turns taking shots of jagermeister before we went out for the night. I can remember riding in Allison's car, but I cannot for the life of me remember where we went that night. Oh, well, I guess. Couldn't have been too many places - it being Natchitoches and all.  Otherwise, not too much happening. Chris is making his famous Open N-train Sandwiches that totally rock! 2 sandwiches: 1 ham and the other roast beef. Spicy brown mustard, mozzerella cheese, Swiss cheese, plum tomatoes. Baked open face until all the cheese melts. FANTASTIC!! Ok, gotta go eat!!

      My cat is evil. There's no other explanation. He must hate me and, now, I severely dislike him. If it weren't snowing last night, I might have thrown him outside. He woke me up at 2:30 am scratching on some boxes that we have set aside for Salvation Army to pick up on Saturday. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Spray, spray, spray with the water bottle. Doesn't really deter him much. He just hides behind the bedroom door and waits for me to lie back down and then starts all over again. My friend, Olivia, suggested a bitter apple spray they carry at the pet store. I'm all for it, let me tell you. He kept me awake for an hour last night. I had just enough time to fall asleep and wake right back up to Chris's alarm at 4:30 am. Fantastic.   On the other hand, it snowed overnight. Boy, did it ever! New York City covered in snow - it's a beautiful sight. At first. As long as you remember not to stand too close to the buildings. Melting snow/falling ice from 50-odd stories up scares the hell out of you if you're not expecting it. It's also startling when it smashes into the windows of the 36th floor on its descent.

      Though yesterday ended better than it started off, I'm back in my dreary mood today. (You would have known all about that already if my stupid email hadn't gotten lost along the way) But luckily, I was finally able to access one of my favorite blogs:  urlLink becca.oooo-caliente . Due to our company firewall, it wasn't letting me view her site, but thanks to some karmic slip - I'M IN!! Woo hoo!! I've missed her blog! Thankfully, I'm still able to access blogs for Court & Oz, so I'm up to date on their happenings in France & London, respectively. Now if only I could get to BigWhiteGuy from work.  Well, I've decided that I would've never made it if I lived in Mauritana back in the day: Obesity is so revered among Mauritania's white Moor Arab population that the young girls are sometimes force-fed to obtain a weight the government has described as "life-threatening". (courtesy  urlLink BBCnews.com ) I still weigh the same as I did when I graduated high school, so I'm afraid that I would have been kicked and spit on - and very poor. Thank goodness we live in a society that idolizes skinny bitches!  Wow! It's snowing! It stopped. It's snowing again! And it stopped again. Make up your mind Mother Nature!! I'll have to change the beat of the music playing in my head to keep up with the changing weather. (from Norah Jones to Black Eyed Peas) OK, now where were we? Oh! This past weekend, Chris bought me How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. It's so nice that he thought about me! Especially when he bought himself 4 more DVDs. Well, at least he thought about me. Point is, it's a really good movie and I so wish my life here in NYC was more like that: parties every night, flexible work hours, great clothes, Knicks tickets, diamonds the size of brussel sprouts dangling from my neck . . .

      So we all know the pros and cons of Bush's State of the Union Address last night, right? Right. Why is it that politics can get people so fired up and that they feel the need to try to make me see their point of view? I used to be interested in doing something political. I remember going to the State Capital in Baton Rouge on a class field trip and loving it. Dreamed of one day working in that grand ole building. I don't know, one day I think it would once again be fun to work in the Capital, but I just can't stand all of the BS that goes along with it.

      Nice long weekend. I needed it. On Saturday, Chris & I went to Down the Hatch with Olivia, Michael, Derrick, Anne & Caroline. $18, about 10 or 12 pitchers of beer later & too many hot wings to count, we left Down the Hatch and took in the 9 pm show at the UCB. Pictures from our outing are in the Gallery 4 album. My stomach did NOT like me the next day!

      New York City is so pretty all covered in snow. It's so very cold outside. They say that you can get frostbite in just 8 minutes of exposure. I believe them! I had my leather gloves on and my fingers were so frozen. And while I'm enjoying watching the white stuff coming down, I know in the next day or so, it will all turn to solid, packed ice that forms a sheet over all of the sidewalks. What mounds of snow are left at that point will be dirty brown or yellow. Ah, snow!   At around 2:30 pm yesterday, I went downstairs to  urlLink Au Bon Pain  to get a cup of coffee. My friend (and co-worker), Laurren, went with me and talked me into getting this devilish little pastry called a crème la fleur, which has cream cheese on top and inside of it. We split it and it was gone in a flash! Yum-scrum-delicious!  Now, it's Friday morning and it's 4 degress outside. I feel a sick day coming on. My boss called out yesterday saying it was too cold for him. I second that motion. As soon as I dry my hair, I'm getting back into bed with Chris.  I've stumbled upon another little blog written by fellow New Yorkers. Check it out by clicking  urlLink here . These people are really funny and I know you'll get a kick out of it.  In the news: a  urlLink watchdog group  has deemed the US military partially responsible in the deaths of two journalists killed at a Baghdad hotel during the Iraq war.  Wow! The return of  urlLink lockable luggage ! I think many travelers will be happy to read about this one. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) now allows you to lock your checked baggage with Travel Sentry(tm) Certified locks.  Something to keep in mind if you haven't eaten yet or if you're in the Evansville, Indiana area:  urlLink Brain Sandwiches  still on some menus even after the mad cow scare. Click here if you'd like to read the story, but I think my first reaction is: Huh? Brain sandwiches? And I thought boudin was tough to stomach.

      Not much happening again today. It's butt-ass cold outside and it's supposed to snow tonight. Why don't I live near a nice sunny beach?  Hearings are beginning in the Louisiana serial killer case on the request to use evidence from the other murders in the first trial. Derrick Todd Lee will first go on trial for the killing of Charlotte Murray Pace of Baton Rouge. He's to go to trial for three other murders with the trial for the killing of Murray Pace to start in March of this year.

      Wow! Today is pretty boring. Nothing in the news. Nothing happening in my world. It's a gray, dreary day outside and it seems like this time of the year, talk always turns to moving home. Must be the weather and lack of sunshine. Oh! It's snowing. Nevermind, it stopped.  Oops! I blogged too quickly: Just found out that the world record for kissing has been broken! 8,890 Chileans set the record for the most people kissing simultaneously. (courtesy MSN.com) There apparently is something happening today - or yesterday.  A friend from work just sent me a link to a story of a couple of guys in Louisiana who were planning a Columbine-style attack on the 5-year anniversary. Click  urlLink here  to read.   I feel so sorry for the woman in this  urlLink following story . She lost her job and kids due to the condition of her home. It's just sad and I feel so bad for her. May that NEVER happen to me.

      Today isn't as cold as it was this weekend (36 today). Thank you God! Unfortunately, it will get cold again this Wednesday. Darn. In order to keep our apartment at a comfortable temperature, I have to close off the bedroom to save heat. On top of that, I keep hearing a noise in our walls that sounds like something is falling. I think it's the plaster from an apartment above ours (I blame it on Sergio). I hope the whole thing doesn't come crashing down on top of us one day. That would suck a big one. Chris and I cleaned out our front closet last night. It used to have 15 boxes of things we've been lugging around from apartment to apartment without anywhere to display. We threw out most of it. We set aside 3 boxes of "stuff" and 2 bags of clothes to go to Goodwill. Now there are only 5 boxes left in that closet. It's so nice! Next weekend, we're doing the middle closet - only 3 boxes. I blame it on TLC's Clean Sweep marathon that ran on New Year's Day.  By the way, if you'd like to see a very clear picture of Chris's red fleur-de-lis tattoo, go to   and then click on the Tattoo & Press link on the left and then click on the Color Work link on the right. Chris's should be the first one up (he got it in July 2003). Hard to miss. It's a big red fleur-de-lis. If you're in NYC and thinking about getting a tattoo, I highly recommend Pon. His work is amazing! And he's worth every penny. And, no, it doesn't hurt a bit. And if you believe that, you're a dumbass. I have a 4x3 inch black shaded fleur-de-lis in the lower middle of my back. I got it on my 23rd birthday. Hurt like hell.  Today, Kathleen Blanco was sworn in as Louisiana's first woman governor. She took the oath in both English and French.   It seems that Martha Stewart is posting about her trials and tribulations on her website www.marthatalks.com  .  Now, I wasn't planning to comment on this story and yet, I really couldn't pass it up. This guy in Germany posted an ad on the Internet seeking someone who was willing to be killed and eaten. One such man replied to the ad. The only thing, according to his partner, is that he "never expressed any desire to die." However, according to Mr. Cannibal, he "wanted to be stabbed to death after drinking a bottle of cold medicine to lose consciousness." (courtesy CNN.com) Hmmm. It would appear we have a conflict of interest in this case. Mr. Cannibal was interested in eating willing participants, but Mr. Victim was only interested in being slaughtered after Robotripping.

      It's 10 degrees this morning. 8 below with the wind chill. Why, God, why? That settles it - I'm putting off Bed Bath & Beyond until midweek or next weekend. Chris & I went to see Big Fish last night and I nearly froze on the walk back home. My earrings simply attracted the cold to the inside of my poor ears. Chris had to go to work this morning and I don't think the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental is heated very well. Poor thing must have 2 or 3 layers on today.

      We're finally doing our gift exchange with Cindy & Jackson today. We got Cindy a DVD player and a movie. We got Jackson a move, a game for his Game Boy Advance, a kit for his Game Boy Advance with: a magnifier, cleaner, case, extra battery. While we were at Best Buy last night, we (of course) got ourselves 4 more DVDs to add to our ever-growing collection. Last night's choices were: Underworld, American Wedding (the unrated version), Alex & Emma (my choice), and XMen 2.  I read on WNBC.com that a man fell asleep on the E train and woke up with a steak knife sticking out of his chest. Holy Crap!! I will NEVER fall asleep on the subway!! Not that I've ever been able to. And then I read a story about a couple of pranksters who tapped into the frequency used by a local Burger King speaker that is used when ordering in the drive-thru lane. When someone orders a whopper, for instance, they yell at the customer and tell them they are too fat and to pull up to the window. Though these guys are cussing at customers, I must admit that it's a little funny. Who would have thought of tapping into the speaker's frequency?   And now, a littly funny: 20 Clues A Woman Should Call It A Night  1. I have absolutely no idea where my purse is. 2. I believe that dancing with my arms overhead and wiggling my butt while yelling WOO-HOO is truly the sexiest dance move around. 3. I've suddenly decided I want to kick someone's ass and honestly believe I could do it too. 4. In my last trip to "pee" I realize I now look more like Tammy Faye Baker than the goddess I was just four hours ago. 5. I drop my 3:00 am. submarine on the floor (which I'm eating even though I'm not the least bit hungry), pick it up and carry on eating it. 6. I start crying and telling everyone I see that I love them sooooo much. 7. There are less than three hours before I'm due to start work. 8. I've found a deeper/spiritual side to the geek sitting next to me. 9. The man I'm flirting with used to be my 5th grade teacher. 10. The urge to take off articles of clothing, stand on a table and sing or dance becomes strangely overwhelming. 11. My eyes just don't seem to want to stay open on their own so I keep them half closed and think it looks exotically sexy. 12. I've suddenly taken up smoking and become really good at it. 13. I yell at the bartender, who (I think) cheated me by giving me just lemonade, but that's just because I can no longer taste the gin. 14. I think I'm in bed, but my pillow feels strangely like the kitchen floor. 15. I start every conversation with a booming, "DON'T take this the WRONG WAY but.." 16. I fail to notice that the toilet lid's down when I sit on it. 17. My hugs begin to resemble wrestling takedown moves. 18. I'm tired so I just sit on the floor (wherever I happen to be standing) and take a quick nap. 19. I begin leaving the buttons open on my button fly pants to cut down on the time I'm in the bathroom away from my drink. 20. I take my shoes off because I believe it's their fault that I'm having problems walking straight.

      Chris and I have decided to work on taking a vacation for ourselves at some point this year. This means that we may not make it home as much during 2004, but since we've yet to take our honeymoon then I'm OK with being a little selfish this time around. Where, you ask? Well, the list is building and so far, we have: the  urlLink Cayman Islands , Jamaica, Costa Rica, Portugal, and the list is growing.   Interesting bit: A painting by artist  urlLink Scott LoBaido  depicts Bush holding Bin Laden's severed head and the American flag in the other hand.  I read a story on the  urlLink AP newswire  where this guy wrapped his friend's apartment completely in foil while he was away on trip to LA. Absolutely hilarious and I'm now plotting to do something similar when I get the chance! Watch out kids! You could be next!  Top 10 Hollywood Money Makers: 1. Jim Carey 2. Nicole Kidman 3.

      18 degrees this morning. 18. Oh, and then there's the wind, which drops the temp down to like 9 degrees. 25 for the high today. Otherwise, not that bad of a day. Yesterday was Chris's first day back to work since he resigned from The Westin. The Mandarin Oriental (his new job) gave him 2 days off paid as a Christmas present, which he took this past Sunday and Monday. He has one more day coming as his New Year's gift, which he'll take sometime next week. While it is nice having him home, he's a loud person. Please don't feel like I'm talking behind his back. I've already told him all of this to his face and he agrees that he likes to make plenty of noise. He even whispers loudly.   Now onto the subject of Berg. Berg has a reputation among our friends here in NYC and he was quite the legend in Monroe as well. (We used to have people drop by who had never come by before and the first thing they wanted to do was meet Berg because they'd heard all about him.) If you'd like to see a picture of him, click on the Galleries 1&2 link on the left. He's 15 pounds of pure evil with claws and teeth. He's very protective of the front hallway for some reason and hates the guys who deliver our groceries. He won't let Amanda and me play a decent game of gin rummy due to his desire to lie down on our cards just as the game gets underway. When Olivia stays over, she's scared to go to the bathroom during the night. Anyway, for the last few nights he has woken me up by scratching on our mattress or playing with a shopping bag. I now keep the water bottle next to me at night and my aim has gotten better with my left hand.  Not too much happening the news world today. Hugh Heffner wants Britney Spears in Playboy. Not that that is really news to me. Every guy in the US wants to see Britney in Playboy. I'm sure that would be the hottest selling issue ever.

      I read a story on MSNBC.com today about a growing trend among teens: getting high from cough medicine, aka Dexing or Robotripping. I don't think this an entirely new concept as I remember it coming into fashion when I graduated from high school in 1996. It is their cough suppressant, dextromethorphan, or DXM, which kids are after. In large doses, DXM can cause hallucinations, heart problems, and a zombie-like state. Sounds like fun, right? Not to mention that wonderful cherry flavor. Unless of course your hardcore and go for the original flavor.  Oh, a little word of advice if you're ever walking around the streets of Manhattan and someone approaches you about your hair. These people are selling packages that are supposed to include services such as: haircut, massaging shampoo, deep conditioning treatment, head massage, facial, etc. The package costs around $60 and then there is an additional $10 service fee that you only pay the 1st time. So, they swipe your credit card right then and there and hand you all of your information. Then you make your appointment with the hair salon and let them know what services you'd like to schedule. Like a dumbass, I did this in March 2003. For all of the "free services" included in my $60 package, it ended up costing me another $150 not including tip. The whole time I was in the salon, these 2 guys were fighting back behind me and had to be pulled apart from each other several times. Since that splendid event, I've been approached another 2 or 3 times. I just look at them and yell, "IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY AND I'LL NEVER MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN!!" Then I run.

      Get ready everyone, I feel the need to jump atop my soapbox: Some of these people that I work with really freaking irk me! Let's take the issue of covering the phones as an example. There are 7 assistants sitting along my row. Of all 7, the 2 whose bosses needed the phones covered until 5 pm on days before & after holidays, well, these are the 2 who either skipped out early or just didn't show up at all. Alright, that's all I can really say about that even though I'd love to go into a rant, but alas, people I work with occasionally read my blog and I must keep things nice and rosy. Peachy f*cking keen. Not to mention those who rudely interrupt me while I'm talking and act as if they've done nothing wrong and I'm just sitting here twiddling my thumbs waiting for them to come and talk to me. (Example #2) Oh, and THE PRINCESS! (Example #3) Her voice will forever grate on my nerves as she retells each story 3 or 4 times or the way she keeps interrupting to ask questions when someone else is talking. You totally lose the point of the f*cking story! Anal! Anal! Anal! Anal! Ok, time to carefully step off the soapbox so I don't fall and kill myself.  So, in today's news: Wisconsin town rings in New Year with  urlLink toilet bowl parade  complete with a giant throne and plunger scepters. (courtesy ABCnews.com)  Oh, and in case you haven't already heard, Britney Spears is now working to annul her new marriage to her lifelong friend from Kentwood, La. She says it all began as a joke that went too far. I think it probably all began with too much alcohol. Well, at least some guy back in Kentwood can claim that he's been married to Britney. Even if it was for only 24 hours or however long it took them to sober up.  And then there's the case of the Crocodile Hunter who went to work feeding hungry crocodiles with his 1-month-old son held next to his side. Maybe I'm wrong (and I don't mean to bring up MJ again), but I'm more worried about MJ dropping his child off a balcony than I am about the Crocodile Hunter bringing his kid to work with him. Oh yeah, the Crocodile Hunter is upset about the connection made between MJ and himself.  From News of the Weird: * In October, San Francisco artist Jonathon Keats, 32, registered his brain as a sculpture and began selling futures contracts on its six billion neurons, offering buyers the rights to any creative products it might produce if science learns how to keep it alive after his death. He also wrote a prospectus for investors, with MRI scans showing the idea-fertility of various brain areas. For now, he is selling inexpensive options ($10) to buy a million neurons for $10,000 when he dies; he sold 71 the first day.  * California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante (runner-up to Arnold Schwarzenegger in the October recall election) is not the family's only public figure. As the San Francisco Chronicle reported in September, his sister Nao Bustamante, 39, is a prominent performance artist whose work includes (1) wearing a strap-on burrito for men to kneel before and bite in order to absolve themselves of "500 years of white man's guilt" and (2) sticking her head into a plastic bag filled with water and tying it around her neck to resemble a Houdini stunt, to create "an urgent situation to respond to."  From Smiley Anders from the  urlLink Baton Rouge Advocate : Giving 'em hell: LeRoy tells of the time Boudreaux was showing Thibodeaux around his new neighborhood when they came upon two beautiful churches directly across the street from each other. Thibodeaux asked why there were two churches so close together and Boudreaux explained that they had different beliefs. He explained it this way: "The church on the left says there ain't no hell, and the church on the right says the hell there ain't."

      Chris and I watched Cold Mountain last night. All in all, a good movie. Neither of us like the ending and I think he cursed it the entire walk home. For some reason, I'm just not a big fan of Nicole Kidman. I think she's a very talented actress, hence all the awards, but she just irks me. Can't explain it. Maybe she's just too perfect or something. There was a girl that I graduated with who was the same way. Damn all you perfect people.  Chris has been playing his new video game Prince of Persia. It is by far the most awesome video game I've seen yet. You can control time and run up walls. Amazing graphics! Though he did have to break down and get the game guide because he got stuck. This game is so full of puzzles and riddles. Kickass game!  Well, it appears that Britney Spears has tied the knot: Pop star  urlLink Britney Spears  marched down the aisle in Las Vegas on Saturday, marrying a childhood friend from Louisiana, according to news reports. (courtesy AP news)  A friend of mine sent me this website for some unique greeting cards, Sugarqube. While it costs about $10 for a year subscription, it's free to sample them all. So check it out by clicking  urlLink here .  OK, it's time to wake up Chris so we can go do 2 weeks worth of laundry. Luckily, the Sugar Bowl game doesn't happen until 8 pm local time so I won't miss out on any of the action. GO TIGERS!!

      I can no longer post during my lunch hour from work, so my posts will now be more sporadic. Also, Chris now only holds 1 full-time job and is off in the evenings and on Fridays & Saturdays, so there's a chance I'll be a little more distracted than normal. On the other hand, I'm really happy to have all of this new-found time with him. I just hope I don't get tired of him!

      HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!  This year, I spent New Year's Eve with Jackson, my 8-year-old nephew who also lives in Queens. We played video games (Sly Cooper) and then watched The Hulk. Uncle Chris made it home (via taxi) about 20 minutes before midnight so we got to ring in 2004 all together.  Sadly enough, before all of the festivities started, Chris called me to let me know that if "something" were to happen, he would find his way home. I then reminded him that it took about an hour and a half to walk from Rockefeller Center across the Queensboro Bridge to our apartment. He said that if it was a real emergency, he would probably make it here in about an hour. Showoff. It just goes to show you the kind of things we have to think about in this day and age. After that little conversation, I was sure glad that Jackson was coming over to take my mind off things! After I picked Jackson up and on our way home, we stopped for some ice cream and then we had corn dogs for our big meal! We sure know how to party!  I hope everyone had great fun in whatever you did to ring in the new year! Here's to 2004! May your hangovers be kind!

      !!!HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAY RUTHIE!!!  (My mother-in-law or Daisie as we like call her)  I didn't blog yesterday after work because Olivia, Chris & I went to see  The Passion of the Christ  and I certainly recommend watching it.  It was bloody & gory, but not overly done.  It may make you reflect a bit, but why shouldn't it?  I don't want to give away the movie, so I'll try to wait to post about it.  I was supposed to go to the movies with Amanda today, but we were late getting there and it was sold out before we could make it halfway through the line at the boxoffice.  We're trying again tomorrow at 3:30 pm and I've already reserved tickets on  urlLink Fandango .  If you live in a smaller city, you might not need Fandango, but on an opening weekend for one of the most hyped-up movies of all times in NYC, Fandango is a necessity.  Since Amanda & I didn't go to the movies, we went shopping.  She had never been to Steinway Street here in Astoria. (She lives in Sunnyside)  Steinway has all of the shops: Express, Victoria Secret, Gap, Gap Kids, The Children's Shop, Foot Locker, Modell's, Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc.  I'm surprised that I didn't spend more than I did - I'm very proud of myself.  We stopped by the party supply store and I bought myself some purple feathers and a glue gun.  This guy at work keeps stealing my pens, so I'm going to decorate my pen with feathers and see if he steals it again.  Chris played paintball today with some of his friends.  On the way out of the city, a city bus sideswipped their car and then took off.  A second car was following the car Chris was in and they flagged down the bus.  Not sure what all happened with that.  They still played paintball even though some of their backs were hurting.  He called just after 5pm from Hooters; I guess they're not hurting too bad.   Saturday's Links  Cool link for you:   urlLink The Man Project .  Not that you can very much with it, but it is so very cool.  Funky (and funny) album covers from yesteryear -  urlLink click here .  What were they thinking?  And why live your day when you can simulate it?  Click  urlLink here .  Awesome, isn't it?  I had 2 bowls of cereal - since it's simulated, I don't have to worry about simulated weight gain, now do I?  And I also drove fast since I don't have to worry about any simulated cops giving me simulated tickets.  OK, must hop off the computer so Chris can download pictures from today's festivities.  Hopefully back later . . .

      Damn our IT department!!  They keeping blocking my posts that I email to myself from work.  Damn them.  Anyway, on Tuesday night, Chris and I met up with 3 others that he worked with at The Essex House: Burn, Ana & Michael.  We had dinner at Peter Luger's Steakhouse in Brooklyn.  This place is well known in these parts for being an incredible place and I must second that, but let me tell you about the adventure we had the other night.  7:35 pm-Burn meets Chris & me on the corner on the way to the subway. 7:45-we're sitting on the subway going into Manhattan where we transfer to the J train at Canal Street. 8:20-sitting on the J train going over the bridge into Brooklyn (the train goes above the river here because the bedrock is too deep; nice view of the city). 8:40-we finally make it to Peter Luger's after walking about 3 blocks from the train; meet Ana & Michael. 8:45 pm-this is our reservation time, which we spend crammed in the bar along with everyone else who has made reservations tonight.  Have some beer and duck when the waiters come by with trays of steaming, hot, sizzling steaks & shrimp (we were starving when we left the apt). 9:30-we finally get seated at our table and have dinner: boiled shrimp, tomatoes & onions, rare & med-rare steaks, German fries, creamed spinach, hot fudge sunday, cheesecake.  Damn, there went the diet. 11:20-leave Peter Luger's and try to find a cab.  There are none, so we walk back to the subway happy, drunk and slipping quietly into a steak coma. 11:30pm-hop on the subway which isn't going into Manhattan, but back one stop into Brooklyn where we transfer to go into Manhattan. 11:45-get off the first strain, transfer to another train (F train) because that one wasn't going any further due to construction. Go in the wrong direction - only 1 stop - turn around and go the right way.  We're rocking now!  Unfortunately, we passed Union Square where Ana & Michael needed to get off, but we stop at Herald's Square/34th Street and all go to our respective trains (N train for us). 1 am-we're finally home!  Go straight to bed so that Chris can get up at 5:15 am to be at work at 7 am.  FANTASTIC!

      I've heard of people looking for love on the internet, but this website is a touch worrisome.  Simply titled  urlLink A Family Proposal , I wonder what kind of people are actually interested in something like this.  I'm sure there are plenty who have responded in earnest, but my response to that is: What the f*ck?!?  As many times as I've emailed my fantastic blog to myself so that I could post, it keeps getting lost along the way.  Seems that someone in our IT department at work sucks.  Luckily, I printed it out today and will now post it so I hope that it has the same passion that I had the other day writing it.  If not, blame the IT guy - I am.  So, here goes:  So there's this guy who is so upset with the current presidential administration that he has put a plea out on the Internet to raise enough money to move his wife, child and himself to the Netherlands.  He supplies numbers and percentages of people supporting/against Bush, the economy, job loss, etc., but I don't think all of his facts are straight.  Granted, I voted for Bush in 2000 and I'm not sure how I'll vote in 2004, but I loathe that EVERYTHING gets blamed on Bush and the current administration.  Something tells me that we didn't lose all of those jobs just because Bush is in office.  I agree that the Patriot Act isn't the best solution to today's problems, and yes, we have "lost" certain freedoms that we once took for granted.  I don't think Iraq was as an imminent threat as we were once told, but a threat nonetheless.  And I don't think it would have been long before it would have become an imminent threat.  There has to be some other underlying issue here - perhaps it could have something to do with the former administration, but to be honest, I don't know and I don't care enough to spend all my days combing facts & figures trying to point fingers when finger pointing won't get the job done.  If anything, it feels like the Bush Administration is running this country like a business.  This guy has even gone so far as to imply that Bush will somehow rig the voting machines in the upcoming election since the maker of the machines, Diebold, is a Bush supporter.  So to  urlLink Daryl , I say, "Haul your ass to The Netherlands and I don't give a shit how you get there!  You won't get any donations from me.  I had to work hard and save to get myself and all of my shit to NYC, so you can do the same, buddy."  Oh!  And when people tell this guy to just leave the US, his response is, "I always find this to be a strange contradiction for a nation that prides itself on 'satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.'"  Ok, Daryl, are you talking about America or Wal-Mart here?  Strangely, I've never heard of this catchy little national motto he speaks of unless of course I'm standing in line at a store or I've just ordered something AS SEEN ON TV.  I seem to remember America's jingle being something like: IN GOD WE TRUST.  I don't know - call me crazy.

      Well, I had this fantastic blog for today's post, but like before, it has gotten lost between here and there.  Oh well, it will be there to post tomorrow.  Luckily, I saved it this time.  Go me!!  I think I just pissed Chris off.  I won't go into details cause it's just confusing, but it included him taking a nap and me trying to send him to bed for the tonight.  Needless to say, he's not my biggest fan right now.  I guess I should go in there and help out now that he's worked out his anger on the poor helpless chicken.

      Another Saturday night well spent!  Chris, Cindy (Chris's sister), and her new boyfriend John, & I went to an Italian restaurant and then to the Upright Citizens Brigade last night.  Good time though I must say that the UCB seems to have blown up in popularity since our last visit about a month ago.  Still a good time no matter how many uptight college kids bump into me in line without saying "excuse me."  Before the show started, the 4 of us perused the grocery store next to the theatre where we happened to see a couple of the actors/comedians from the UCB.  One of the guys does spots on VHI for shows like  The 80's Strikes Back  and  The Best Week Ever .  It probably won't be the last time I see these guys since Chris will begin taking improv classes in early March.  He's been wanting to do this for a while, so I'm glad he got off his ass and signed up - oh, that's right, I had to actually sign him up.  Well, close enough.  And now, the list of random links for your viewing pleasure: Your very own  urlLink Pimp Cup  - just what every family dinner needs!  I've seen some interesting things posted by the Japanese and I can proudly add this to this to the ever-growing list.  Check out some of the  urlLink strangest trucks  on the planet!  If you ever thought your house was messy, please click on this link for what must be the  urlLink most cluttered house in America !  I don't understand how someone lives like this.  The sad thing is that I'm sure there are homes that are worse than this.  And now for the  urlLink suicidal snowman  - I must admit that I'm getting stircrazy myself with this cold weather.  And let's not leave out those of you looking for additions to your art collection.   urlLink Gallery of Original Booty Babe Art  - you know you're curious!  Just go ahead and click on the link.  Ah!  I'm so proud: the  urlLink Miss White Trash Beauty Pageant .  Fantastic ladies.  You make us all so proud.  I guess the one positive thing I can point out is that NONE of these ladies are from the Deep South.  Ah!  And some  urlLink virtual knee surgery  for your viewing/interactive pleasure!  You get to actually perform the surgery yourself and, for me, find out why I'm not a surgeon making loads of money.  Even though this is animated, it still makes me slightly queasy.  Until tomorrow, kids, Enjoy!!

      So, I'm doing my research for our trip to Europe this August. Since we don't want to squander all of our money in Europe, I'm looking into staying at some hostels. What are hostels, you ask? Well, they can be anything from a B&B, dorms, convent, etc. where you share rooms and bathrooms. Usually, the men sleep in one area and the women in another though private rooms are available for a slightly higher rate. Hostels are great if you want to keep things cheap and you want to meet loads of different people. For the most part, it appears that younger people stay at hostels - especially all of those who are backpacking across Europe. I'm really intrigued by this whole concept and can't wait to stay in one! We'll, of course, have a few nights in a real hotel with our own private bath - probably in Rome and then in Paris. We're planning to take the eurail from Rome to Paris and stop at various places along the way. You know, keep our travel somewhat open and spontaneous. I think we must be tapping into some part of ourselves that missed out when we were just a bit younger and a bit poorer.   Yesterday after work, some of the girls, Chris and I went out for a few drinks at this place called The Grotto. Today, I'm going with Olivia to a margarita place - if the Chairman of our company doesn't open up a bottle of wine for us after work, that is. I'm hoping he'll open up the wine and we can drink here instead of spending our money elsewhere. I need to blow off some steam after today's fiasco of trying to get an earlier flight for someone that I work with. The whole thing ended with him on a later flight (due to weather delays) and him hanging up on me. At that point, I went downstairs for coffee and a puff off of my friend's cigarette. I don't smoke unless I'm REALLY pissed off, which doesn't happen very often. Very frustrating!  OK, time for a few links. First, the  urlLink RoboReceptionist . I never thought I would feel threatened by the advancement of working robots in my job as an Administrative Assistant. When you see movies like A.I. or Terminator and the like, you think about automotive jobs or factory jobs being the first where robots replace humans in the workforce. Now, with the RoboReceptionist, they're hitting closer to home and I don't think that I like it. There are still downsides to this little experiment of theirs: the person seeking info must type in their question; she can't handle anything too complicated, etc. It's just scary - that's all I'm saying.   So do you remember they guy from the American Idol tryouts - Hawaii, I think it was - that made you laugh until you pee'd your pants when he sang Ricky Martin's She Bangs? Well, this guy has such a cult following from his 90 seconds of fame, he now has his own website and he actually has contracts and deals! I saw him on TV last night on ESPN, I think. He's been on the Ellen Degeneres show and has been the subject of a skit on SNL. Check him out  urlLink here . You'll need speakers/sound to hear his American Idol audition. Warning! William Hung has had NO professional training - just so we're clear on this.

      Sorry for the absence in blogging as of late. No excuses really - just being lazy. Chris offered to do the dishes tonight so that leaves me wonder what it is exactly that he wants out of this. Oops! Now he's singing The Bee Gees' Staying Alive. In a really high pitched voice. And I think he's dancing in there. If only you could witness this event!  I have a FANTASTIC list of links to dole out to you but, unfortunately, I must go assist with dinner tonight: lemon chicken, rice, and broccoli.  Since I hear that my father-in-law (we'll call him Fred) is feeling down today all the way down in Lake Charles, La, I'm adding this link especially for him and because I know we need to see one more parody of the Janet/Justin Super Bowl Showstopper! Click  urlLink here . Ok, the real link I wanted to include for him is  urlLink here . Caution - contains nudity. Oh! And because I know he's probably pretty bored sitting in his hotel room, click here to play a small  urlLink game . Chris says it's addictive and since I had to physically remove him from the computer because of this game, I'll agree. I nearly forgot - just in case anyone has been left wondering, the advanced  urlLink Donald Rumsfield fighting techniques  are here! OK, OK, I have to go help make dinner. The rest of the list will come soon! I promise!  And last but not least (by far!) - Shout out to my 1-year-old nephew (as of yesterday) IAN!! Happy Birthday playa!

      I'll be back later today to blog after I return from Manhattan. I'm to meet Cindy & Jackson at H&M Clothing Store on 5th Avenue, which is across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral. Unfortunately, it's butt-ass cold outside and I'm not looking forward to being outside today but I just can't sit home all day today. I HAVE TO get out of my apartment! OK, just talked to Cindy and we're meeting at Ellen's Stardust Diner on the corner of 51st and Broadway, which is the ONLY diner that I can remember where it's located. It's also the diner we ALWAYS go to when someone comes to visit. The wait staff sings during your meals - they're all aspiring actors/actresses hoping to make their big break in the City.  Chris and I have been looking into different locations for our trip, which we've decided to take around our 2-year anniversary in August. So it seems we're looking around the Mediterranean - maybe start in Rome and then see where the winds take us.  On a progressive note, Chris has FINALLY signed up to take classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater starting March 7th. His class will be on Sunday evenings.  This is only level 1 and he'll have a few more to go through, but he'll give this one a shot and see how he likes it. Personally, I don't understand how he's not already on stage somewhere. If you've ever met him, you know he's hilarious! By the way, the Upright Citizens Brigade is where Horatio Sanz (of SNL) got his start, among others like Matt Walsh. Oh! Chris dogsat for Adam Sandler the other day at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Most of the cast of 50 First Dates were at the hotel for a press junket. Chris says they're all really nice - especially Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider. Points in our books, boys, points in our books.  This week's  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings  I say ... and you think ... ?   1. Dragon :: China 2. Molecule :: scientist 3. Tire :: Goodyear 4. Mighty :: Joe Young 5. Octane :: fuel 6. Troll :: bridge, stream, pay a toll 7. Atmosphere :: pressure 8. Guide :: you lead, I'll follow 9. Leash :: dog 10. Dustmite :: need to dust  OK, off to eat some diner food baby!

      Not much going on today since it's the most dreaded day of the year for every single person on the planet. I'm not single, but Chris and I have both expressed our distaste for this "holiday" over dinner and a movie last night. By the way, 50 First Dates was pretty damn funny! I recommend. Ok, so off to the weird links I found this morning.  This one is just strange, gross and there's really no other explanation for it since I have no idea what's going on - all in Japanese or something. Very strange. Click  urlLink here .  Ever wondered what it would be like to pop a water balloon in space? I know you have. I sometimes can't sleep at night without trying to figure out just what would happen. Well, you can now rest easy because it's finally  urlLink here !  Want a hoodie with the name of your neighborhood on it? Then click  urlLink here .  Cute stuff.  Want to see an animated  urlLink girl pee standing up ? Yep, very strange indeed. Thank you Magic Cone. I will not be buying this one.  OK, this is something you just have to see! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! Click  urlLink here !  And next, a pretty damn funny  urlLink Nutrigrain  commercial. At the end, you'll feel GREAT!  And finally, a  urlLink weird and twisted animated movie . It's what every Valentine's Day needs.  So on this special day, Rock Hard & Love Long!

      Ah! Elevator Episodes! What are Elevator Episodes, you ask? Well, you see, at work I go down for coffee every afternoon around 2:30 pm with some friends. When the mood strikes us and there isn't anyone else in the elevator we work with, we start these louder-than-usual conversations about random things - can't get into details. We like to stay covert in our operations. It's funny when one our lips are quivering because we're having a hard time keeping a straight face or we're counting floors because we're about to pop a stitch. I wonder if we're really having as much fun as we think we're having or if we're just delirious by that point in the day. Ah, who cares.  My Dad sent me the following today and I just had to share: Southernisms  Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit.  It's been hotter'n a goat's butt in a pepper patch.  He fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down.  It's so dry the trees are bribing the dogs.  He's as country as cornflakes.  This is gooder'n grits.  Busier than a cat covering crap on a marble floor.  If things get any better, I may have to hire someone to help me enjoy it.  I'm bout as nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  Busy as a moth in a mitten.  Happy as a clam at high tide.

      Howdy do?! I'm working on a list for tomorrow's post which is quite time consuming, so I won't post too much today. Chris just sold both of his paintballs guns on eBay. One will go to Indiana and the other goes off to Kansas. May they make someone happy. They're making me happy just by not being here and when the money comes through for the payment on these things, it'll been even sweeter. OK, off to make some spaghetti for my honey.

      Wow! Another fantastically boring Monday! Well, I guess that's better than being too busy to sit down at my desk. So I will try not to complain. At lunch today, I went over to The Gap to get my little nephew something for his birthday coming up on the 17th. So I'm at the cash register and the guy says, "did you buy out the store?" and I artfully reply, "well, if the women's section wasn't done entirely in pastels, I would have bought something for myself instead." Yes, I know I left him reeling in shock but sometimes you just have to put your foot down. I absolutely refuse to wear pastel colors so that I match a gazillion random kids walking down the sidewalks of New York. Not me, buddy. No way.  Speaking of fantastic days, I got the new Mardi Gras rice bag order form in today's mail from Bertrand Rice down in Elton, Louisiana! http://www.bertrandrice.com Check out their site and order something! The couple that owns/runs this little shindig are cousins of mine on my Dad's side. Every time we would go down to South Louisiana to visit, we would stay at their house. David & Lorraine have 3 kids: Jon, Andre & Julie. So much fun!! Jon is in school and is also currently in a band that travels around playing Cajun music. Andre is at McNeese studying hard, I'm sure. Julie is at LSU and running track. My oldest sister, Bridget, sees her from time to time, as Bridget is a grad student at LSU.   Well, I haven't been down to good ole Elton in about 7 years and I sure would like to go again soon. They do an old fashioned Mardi Gras run where all the men dress up and ride horseback along a predetermined route. They start (usually) at my cousin Todd's house for a little breakfast. The men ride their horses while a wagon follows that carries the musicians and the beer. At homes along the route, the Captain of the "krewe" will ask for permission for the group to approach the house. Once they have permission, the group sings a song, which asks for a little something to go into the pot for their gumbo. If the owner wishes to contribute a chicken, for example, then they release the live chicken in the yard for the boys to catch. Once the chicken is caught, its neck is wrung and it is tied to one of their horses to be brought back to add to the gumbo. This continues throughout the route and they acquire various ingredients for the gumbo. The ride ends at the local Catholic Church where the women take the goodies the men have brought back and they make their gumbo. All who have contributed are invited to attend and partake in some social gathering and mighty fine gumbo.  OK, off the feel good stuff for a bit. Time to get down to stupid political antics: Amazingly enough, someone (OK, any active Democrat about right now) out there is willing to spend hard earned money to look into whether or not our President went AWOL from the Alabama National Guard in 1972. Granted there's no investigation at this point, but as this is an issue now, it will certainly be an issue later this year during the campaign for the White House. I'm floored - who the hell cares?!? Do you? If you were going to vote for George Bush in November, would this newfound knowledge change your vote? Are we voting on what happened in 1972 (6 years before I was born) or are we voting on what's going on right now in this country and in this wonderful world of ours? Yeah to Kerry who received 3 purple hearts, a bronze star and a silver star in Vietnam. Congratulations. Well done. Kudos. That still doesn't tell me that he can run this ship any better than ole George W. F*ck it! I'm voting for Ross Perot.  And finally, the Grammys. I guess if you didn't know who Beyonce was before, then you do now. Other than that, the show left me hopeful that MTV's music awards will be absolutely fabulous this year because the Grammy's were slightly boring. The media has used the words: demure, downplayed, etc. They say the only way Justin Timberlake was allowed appear was if he apologized, which he did. BORING! I wish Janet had shown up - that really would have rattled everyone! And we'd all be happier viewers if SOMEONE - ANYONE would have gotten rattled. Thank goodness MTV goes over the top each year!

      Not much going on this weekend. A couple of friends came over yesterday afternoon. We just sat around and ate, drank beer watched a movie and some funny shows on TV. Good time! Plan was to go out last night, but I wasn't really feeling that well so we altered our plans. Thanks girls! Next time, we're definitely going out!  I found a really cool website the other night that was stamped onto a $1 bill, which was also stamped with a fleur-de-lis. Check out  urlLink Where's George  where you can track your paper currency and see where different bills have traveled over time. You can enter in bills that are currently in your wallet after you open an account (free!), so check it out!  This next one will make you chuckle and yet I found it to be slightly disturbing. But don't take my word for it, check out Mr. Bush in  urlLink drag .  I say ... and you think ... ?  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings   1. Identity:: different 2. Reveal:: open 3. Live:: not dead yet 4. Attitude:: extra flavor 5. Night:: sleep 6. Nevada:: Las Vegas 7. Weekend:: no work/sleep late 8. Write:: something I like to do 9. Friend:: it takes all different kinds 10. Seventeen:: ah! the year I graduated high school  Well, those crazy Asians have done it again! Check out the Asian version of  urlLink Cereal and Milk . I just shook my head the whole time.

      Damn Verizon. For some reason, I haven't been able to access my home email. Hope they get that fixed soon. I must have a billion junk emails to sort through so I can feel important. Why, yes, I would like to enlarge my penis, look at busty girls all the live long day, and make millions without ever leaving my home. America in the 21st century - isn't it great!  Here's a little diddy I think you'll like. It takes a moment to load and it's in a different language, but sometimes you just don't need to understand what's being said to understand what's going on. Click  urlLink %20&f_id=681">here .  Well, it looks like I've found yet another website for  urlLink 80's paraphenelia . AWESOME!  Here it is!! The website of the guy who  urlLink streaked the Super Bowl ! Yeah, baby!!  And this next one is kind of creepy, but it's like a wreck on the side of the road. You HAVE TO watch it! You can't stop. It's addicting. Check it out  urlLink here . It's almost as creepy as watching that doll thing sit in front of her computer and take off her clothes or rearrange herself or whatever she was doing. Remember that one? If not, check that one out  urlLink here .  And for all of my fellow drinking friends, you'll enjoy this little site devoted to  urlLink drinking stuff . You can find out your blood alcohol content, drink converter, drink calorie counter, etc. Not a bad spot to visit.

      I've added another link under "blogs i read" in case you're interested. It's  urlLink Yates on the States  and pretty damn cool by my standards. Seems I spend most of my days floating from blog to blog to blog. Always lookin' baby, always lookin'. As a matter of fact, I just rolled over to ole' Faye's site and she seems to be having a rather rotten day. To quote, if I may:  "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuckity, fuck fuck!!!! And that's how I feel no matter what.   fuck it."  It would seem our dear friend could use a little pick-me-up. Poor dear. I'll have to send her some stickers or some other cool crap that fell out of yet another magazine onto my living room floor. Have no fear - I'll send something cool Faye! I promise!  So, I bit the bullet and called Salvation Army today. It seems that I neglected to post about this lovely experience, but about 3 weeks ago I scheduled an appointment so they would come by and pick up all of the junk Chris & I have set aside for donation. January 31st - last Saturday. So I jump out of bed around 8:30 Saturday morning. Throw clothes on. Forego a shower just in case they should come by for the pick up. (you can see where this is going, right?) Chris is asleep and I don't want to wake him, so I pull out all of the donation items (9 boxes and 3 or 4 bags) into the front hallway. This is great since the guys won't have to walk too far and can grab the stuff and go. Fantastic! I'm on top of things. Well, the hours tick away. Chris finally wakes up. Says, "they still haven't come to get this stuff?" Smartass. Next thing I know, it's 9:30 at night and I'm telling Chris, "well, they could technically still come, right?" I am so stupid, stupid, stupid. I was all set to buy some rather large garbage bags this weekend and throw all of it out, but Chris made me feel guilty. So, I called them again today and in about 2+ more weeks, it'll all finally be GONE!! Again.  Now I'm going to turn toward the TV in my nice swivel computer chair and watch a repeat of The Apprentice since I missed last week's episode. And then at 8:30 pm, I switch over to American Idol. There! I said it - I WATCH AMERICAN IDOL! But in my defense, this is the 1st season I've watched it and there really hasn't been much on TV since I started watching only 2 or 3 days ago. Uh! I need to go take a shower.

      Not much happening in my world right now. I was supposed to go out to dinner with Chris at this place called  urlLink Water's Edge , which is here in Astoria but it has a fantastic view of Manhattan. So I'd heard loads about it, right? Right. So last week, I call up and get reservations for tonight at 7 pm (it being Restaurant Week and everything). All set - everything's a go. Then, we were to go to  urlLink Copacabana  for a party for one of Chris's co-workers. Well, without getting into too much detail (because frankly, I'm a bit tired today), dinner is cancelled and Chris is now partying at  urlLink Copacabana  with his buddies. It was all a time issue really since Chris's friends started partying at around 4 pm. Since I had to work until 5 pm and then go home, change clothes and try to find the place by myself . . uh, . . . don't think so kid. From what I read online, the place has quite the line on Tuesday nights not to mention velvet ropes. Sorry, but I find velvet ropes to be intimidating.  Well, for anyone else who has had a long day, perhaps you'll enjoy this little diddy:  urlLink Online Orgasmic Simulation . Interestingly enough, there is no nudity associated with this link but not something you want to try to expain to little Johnny sneaking a peek over your shoulder. Enjoy my little ones. Enjoy.  Well, since not much else is going on, I'll end this by sending out a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY to  urlLink Natalie ! I'm just a fan of her site. Pretty damn kickass, my friends. Kickass.  urlLink Natalie , I hope you party like a rockstar for at least 1 night!

      Super Bowl - one game, so many topics around the water cooler this morning. #1 - can we address the fact that  exposing Janet Jackson's ta-ta WAS planned? Regardless of who said what after the "incident," it was planned. CBS might not have known about it, not sure if MTV knew about it, but Justin Timberlake & Janet Jackson certainly did - hence the huge chunk of metal attached to her nipple. And why don't we back up just one more step: why the hell was Janet Jackson even performing? She hasn't had a hit in like 10 years! All of the other performers have had hits in the last 1-2 years. Why Janet? Why not some Grammy award-winning performer from the last 2 or 3 years? If you ask me (and it  really doesn't matter if you didn't since I get to rant on and on and on, but), this was all a big stunt to 1) boost a sagging career & tat-ta and 2) take the media off her brother for a bit. Don't know how well that worked out since the FCC is now looking for some answers. Good luck with that one CBS, MTV, Janet & Justin! But don't take my word for it! No, listen to what a real expert has to say! Click  urlLink here .  Oh! And #2 of my rant from above: why didn't they show us the streaker?!? (top of the 3rd quarter) I'm outraged! It's not like he wasn't at least wearing a thong. I'm shocked and appalled that I wasn't offered the chance to watch some British guy running naked across the field during out beloved Super Bowl. It's the Super Bowl, man! Why wouldn't  someone streak? And if it's never happened before, then the real question is why has it never happened before. I mean, this is America gosh-dog-gonnit! Why did we have to let someone else do our dirty work for us?!? We're not thinking Americans!   And now it's time for  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings ! I say . . . and you think . . .?  1. Ignore :: the stupid bitch to your right 2. Death :: party for the deceased 3. Missy :: Elliott 4. Ballet :: tutus 5. Guest :: not actually invited to the party, but they lucked up anyway 6. Campus :: college 7. Lonely :: in a crowd 8. Company :: sometimes a lot of work 9. Helicopter :: twirly bird 10. Sterile:: easy form of birth control  Ever wondered what Lord of the Rings would have been like if it'd been written by someone other than JRR Tolkein? You know you have! Click  urlLink here . The VC Andrews one is pretty darn good!  A little sampling if you will: Dr. Seuss  by  urlLink gonzoron   "Gandalf, Gandalf! Take the ring! I am too small to carry this thing!"  "I can not, will not hold the One. You have a slim chance, but I have none. I will not take it on a boat, I will not take it across a moat. I cannot take it under Moria, that's one thing I can't do for ya. I would not bring it into Mordor, I would not make it to the border."

      I'm sure most everyone is watching the Super Bowl today. Hell, I even know a few people who actually went all the way to Houston to watch it all in person. Ah, the perks of knowing people in the business. They don't get the tickets for free, but they at least get a chance to buy decent tickets. I hope they're having a blast! For the rest of us sitting at home watching all of the pre-game mumbo gumbo, here's a little something to help while away the time:  This next couple may take a little bit to load, but hysterically disturbing, nonetheless. Not something to watch with impressionable kids around. Part 1:  urlLink Stick Figure Penalty  Part 2:  urlLink Stick Figure Penalty: Chamber 2   This next one is long, but worth it. It's interactive and has loads of violence. Enjoy!  urlLink Ray - Part 1   And the  urlLink Bug on a Wire  game is always fun!  Ok, little ones, I'm off to watch more Super Bowl mumbo gumbo and pray that my darling husband will do the laundry like he said he would do. Just earlier he called me and offered me $50 to do it for him, but I did it the last few times all by myself and I think it's just his turn already. Besides, I know he'd probably never actually hand over that money so I'm just saving myself extra work. And he had 3 days off this weekend. He's Mr. Procrastinator! And I am his lovely bride. Tee Hee!

      Learning how to sew . . . it takes a lot of patience.  Amanda came over Monday night and we laid out some fabric for a crib bumper she's making for her sister.  Unfortunately, we had to lock Berg out of the room so he wouldn't lay down on the fabric and pattern pieces.  The whole time he was shut out, he kept sticking his little furry orange paw underneath the door.  He can be cute and funny sometimes and then he can be the devil other times.  He's a very strange animal indeed.  Chris and I went to the UCB last night for a couple of shows.  All very awesome and very hilarious!

      Last Friday, I honed by flower arranging skills once again.  The president of our company has a vineyard in Australia and at harvest time each season, he has flowers from the vineyard shipped to our offices.  My friend (and coworker), Laurren, and I do most of the arranging.  Another friend, Dawn, sometimes helps out - but she's usually busier than we are.  Anyway, we ended up making like 7 or 8 arrangements from these 2 boxes and these are some of the most exotic flowers I've ever seen.  They have this one flower called a protea, which actually comes from bush, and it looks like that plant/flower from  Little Shop of Horrors  that at any point could jump out and eat you.     Otherwise, not too much has been happening.  I was in one crazy ass mood this past weekend.  You know the kind when you've started evaluating certain areas of your life and you don't like what you see but you can't blame anyone but yourself?  Yeah, I was in that mood Saturday and Sunday.  Chris & I were supposed to be going to Peter Luger's Steakhouse again tonight with some of his friends from The Essex House (hotel), but those plans changed.  Now, I think we're going to slip out to a couple of shows at Upright Citizens Brigade.  Should be loads of fun since we haven't been in a little over a week.  Ok, off to powder the nose and then off to the show.  Later gators.  Oh!  And I knew I said I would do the links today - and I might still after we get back - but if I don't, tough shit.  You'll get them when you're ready for them.  Now behave!

      OK, so now I've decided to change things again.  Since some people were getting confused as to whether or not these stories are autobiographical, I've decided to move them to a different page with a link to the right - titled  urlLink YAYA STORIES .  Let me assure you that these stories are all fiction.  My husband is a loving man who puts me on the top of a pedestal - for the most part.  I slip off the pedestal when things like paintball and comic books come up, but that's only happens once in a full moon so I'm ok with that.  If you enjoy the stories, them drop me a line and let me know.  I don't know how often I will post a new chapter in this ongoing saga, but I will do my best to entertain the masses.  I will have to get to the weekly links tomorrow since I now need to go make dinner: pork chops, mashed potatoes, gravy & green beans.  Yep, I cook!  Go figure!

      Since I've changed my posts as of late, I guess I should explain.  I used to write some short little stories for my own personal amusement back in high school.  Now since I have so much free time on my hands and this blog as an outlet, I've decided to pick it back up again.  But have no fear, you will still get your weekly links.  Unfortunately, this weekend's links will come after I get back from a baby shower out on Long Island and while I am doing laundry once I get back from the shower.  So until then, enjoy the stories and if you just hate them, post a comment and we'll go from there.

      She had such a fucked weekend.  It all started Friday with too much to drink.  On Saturday, he just wouldn't quit calling her names.  He said he was just picking on her, but she'd had enough.  The whole situation pissed her off.  To top it all off, he began lecturing her on getting a new job.  She doesn't know why he thinks she hates her job so much.  She's told him time and time again that she likes her job.  She likes the people she works with.  Why does he keep telling her that she needs to find another job - one that she'll actually enjoy going to.  How many times does she have to tell him?  And now she's left by herself the whole day to contemplate the past few days.  She wakes up feeling inadequate.  She feels like a loser.  She doesn't like how she feels about herself or her situation.  And that seems to be the problem with her.  People push and push her in directions that aren't her own.  She's played everyone else's games for the past few years.  Now she feels stifled and ignored and yet she knows that her situation won't change unless she takes hold of the reins.  That one little step is the scariest and she knows it, but she's tired of feeling this way.  She can see a fight coming soon.  A big one.  One that will affect her in many ways.  And yet she knows that it will only affect those areas in her life that she allows it to affect.  She has to be in control again.   *all stories are fiction

      "I got a new pink top this morning to wear to Webster Hall for fight night tomorrow," she told her friend.  "Pink?" her friend inquires.  Yes, she thought, my world's gone to pink!  But I can't get away from it this season.  It stares out at me from every single store window I pass.  It seems that every shop in Manhattan has clothes in varying shades of pepto bismol.  What to do, she pondered.  She'll wear her new pink top that's topless but has this swanky piece of lace that is attached under the breast and then wraps around her neck, knowing that it will choke her at some point during the night.  Knowing that part of her future is taken care of, she turns her thoughts to dinner.  Nothing jumps out at her from the cabinets, which is a good thing considering food doesn't generally jump.  She knows the pork chops in the freezer will take too long to thaw.  And if she went that route, she'll have eaten Berg's cat food before dinner would be ready.  "It should definitely be something that tastes good," he suggests.  She nods her approval and hopes that he wouldn't prefer something that tastes like it came off the subway floor instead.  She shakes her head and narrows it down to meatless spaghetti or ordering dinner from the Chinese place down the street.  "Spaghetti!" he says, so spaghetti it is.  ***  She stands at the sink washing last night's dishes and she thinks back to her commute home this evening.  They guy she sat next to on the train smelled curiously like hotdogs.  She tried not to look directly at him as it is common knowledge that you just don't look directly at anyone in New York City.  He got off at Queensboro Plaza and took the smell of hotdogs with him.  Perhaps he's a street vendor, she thought.   *all stories are fiction

      "Sweet, sweet nectar of Mexico!  La Cerveza Mas Fina!  I concur!" she shouts.  He just looks at her from the couch, controller in hand.  She's drinking her Corona and he has Star Wars on the brain.  She's had a long day and doesn't want to think about how she stayed 45 minutes late at work today.  "I wanna be on Hollywood Squares!" he says.  OK.  Pencil that one in.  Today is just another day for the record books.  Another day spent staying late at work, which seems to be happening a lot more lately.  Ever since that fateful memo was circulated, her workload seems to have doubled.  She thinks back to the days when she first started working at this company.  She had nothing to do.  Absolutely nothing besides flipping through magazines, surfing the internet and planning her wedding.    Two and half years later, she wonders why her boots hate her so much and what will happen if she can no longer walk like a normal person.  "You're becoming a New Yorker," they tell her.  Fashion - it hurts so much sometimes.  She remembers when she was a little girl, when her mom would fix her hair and she would squirm in the chair.  Her mom would say, "you have to suffer to be beautiful."  She grins and looks back down at her feet knowing that by morning, she'll have forgotten how she had to peel her boots off along with the wet, sweaty socks.  In the morning, she'll pull her boots back on for one more day, waiting for Spring and Summer - flip flop season!   *all stories are fiction

       Your Sunday Links:    urlLink PETA , eat your heart out.  I'd be surprised to find I don't have a relative in a similar picture somewhere in the universe.  Fantastic site.  Just  urlLink click it .  You'll love it.  You'll bookmark it.  You'll thank me.  I've heard this one before, but it's always so funny to hear again.  It's a  urlLink radio prank call gone wrong .  When I was younger, we would go out to visit my grandparents every Sunday after church.  Louisiana being Louisiana and summer being damn hot, we always found ourselves sitting out on the front porch and my grandfather would always have a fly swatter by his side killing all of the unlucky flies who came within range.  Now that I'm here in NYC, I don't have a front porch and summer is rarely hot.  I very rarely see flies here, but I can relive my memories with the  urlLink virtual fly swatter .  Hours of useless fun!  I found  urlLink this website  on blorgy and laughed my ass off!  Of course I cringed toward the end and I am now rethinking the whole childbearing thing.  I have never heard childbirth described in such a fashion.  Funny, but scary.  And finally, some awesome  urlLink doctored photos .  Really cool!

      She steps out into the cold wet night and clings to his arm as they turn and head toward the busier street just down the corner.  She smiles as they catch sight of a yellow cab sitting on the opposite side of the street.  They're lucky; it's so hard to find a yellow cab when it's raining.  He motions to the cabbie and they climb in the backseat and are on their way.  They sit in silence as they cross the bridge into Manhattan.  She likes looking into the apartments that are lit up, noticing how they're decorated and arranged in comparison to the others.  He has his sights set toward downtown but says nothing.  They're both lost in their thoughts and the goodies displayed in shop windows they pass.  At the corner of 8th Avenue and 26th Street, they pay the cabbie the $15 fare and climb out to make their way to the little theater that has become one of their favorite spots.  Inside they wait in line for the box office to open.  They're always so anxious to get good seats; they like to be in the first row.  The box office announces the sale of tickets and they step up to pay their $16.  Once in the theater, they grab their usual seats, drop off their coats and head to the bathroom and then the bar for $4 beers.  The details are taken care so now they can enjoy the next hour which promises to be filled with laughter and fun.  After the show, they step out of the little theater smiling and recount their favorite parts of the show.  Then talk turns to food and their cross-town trip they need to make to get to their next stop of the evening.  He hails a cab and they hop in.  "We need to get to 33rd Street at 2nd Avenue, please," she says.  She turns to him and asks how he's feeling and if he's up for the rest of the night.  He assures her that he's fine and that he'll let her know if he starts feeling bad again.  At the corner of 31st and 2nd Avenue, they climb out of the cab and begin the search for dinner.  They pick a nice little restaurant and bar just 2 doors down from their next stop for the evening.  It's dark inside with old fashioned lighting and a nice dark oak bar that just begs patrons to pull up a stool and order an ale.  They comply and also order a little food to help ward off the evils of drinking on empty stomachs.  They make small talk with the bartender and listen to one of the regulars telling stories in a booming voice.  They laugh with the others and then turn their attention toward their food and drink when it arrives.  An hour later, they pay their $25 bill and leave the bartender a $10 tip, step out into the night and walk the 5 steps to the last stop for the night.  Once inside the crowded bar, they make their way to the back to find her friends drinking beers and cocktails; introductions are made.  He steps up to the bar and orders them beers.  Heineken for her, Corona with a lime for him.  They walk out the back door down the steps to the covered courtyard bearing a pool table.  A couple of guys are setting up for a game of 8-ball.  It's chilly out, but the alcohol helps to keep them warm.    They hang out with their friends for the next couple of hours and then decide to head home around midnight.  He has to be at work early the next morning.  Outside the bar, they walk uptown a couple of blocks to get ahead of the others hailing cabs on the street.  They spot a cab making a dropoff and then climb inside.  Twenty minutes later, they're home.  They struggle out of their coats and winter clothes.  She slips into something a little more comfortable; a purple silk slip with lace.  Ten minutes later, the lights go out and they head to the bedroom.  Yes, it's another great night that leaves them smiling as they fall asleep in each other's arms.   *all stories are fiction.

      Happy Belated Birthday Roni!!  Sorry, I missed my post yesterday since we were watching  Dawn of the Dead  , which was awesome!!  Tonight we're going to out a bar on the East side around 34th Street for a friend's birthday party.  $30 all you can drink from 10 pm to 2 am.  Sounds like a winner to me!!  I'll let you know how it turns out.  This link is fun, if not a little gross but I know you'll enjoy it!   urlLink Click here !  For all of the hunters in our lives who have come back from a day in the woods with only 1 sock or part of a tshirt, there's the  urlLink off road commode .  Go to the website and then view the video.  Kinda funny.  This link contains nudity, but it's fascinating.  It's a  urlLink boob job without surgery .  Interesting, indeed.

      Happy, happy Thursday!  When all the good shows come on!  Or most of them anyway.  I read an article that Omorosa, the bitch who got fired from Apprentice, just got some Ebony award and she's got offers for some sort of political commentating job for the upcoming election.  I hope she enjoys her 15 minutes of fame because I can't imagine that she'll last long as dramatic as she is.  I so can't stand that bitch.  Anyway, I was walking into my building today after work and after stopping off to do a little grocery shopping when I ran into one of my neighbors, Julie.  We're inside the building but outside our apartments chatting away and I hear Berg (satanic cat) meowing at the door.  Since I'm just standing there anyway, I let him out into the hallway.  He's rubbing all over the wall kind of hopping as he turns around and goes for another rub.  He's wagging his tail and he's so happy.  As soon as I get us both back inside, he turns evil again.  Ah, what can you expect?  I'm just keeping the water bottle  beside me so I can spray him in the face when he starts scratching on the door or the movies/dvds or the mattress or the window or Chris's amp or the couch . . .

      It is still snowing today - very lightly, but still snowing.  I'm so ready for summer!!  I ended up coming home early today because I'm not feeling well.  Lucky for you, that means that I've found time to post some links since yall have been so good to me lately!  If you haven't seen the QVC knives blooper,  urlLink click here .  It takes a while to load, but damn funny.  And while I was nosing around the net, I came across a story titled:  urlLink RIAA Claims Music on Car Radios Meant Only for Original Vehicle Owner .  The story was pretty comical, which makes me wonder if this website is entirely satirical.  Well, you can be the judge and then feel free to let me know.  Then there is the story of a  urlLink fag and his fagmaster .  Don't worry, this isn't some biased story of homosexuals, but a story of what the true word "fag" is all about.  Interesting little read about a gentler time.  I eventually found this website full of strange, yet very interesting photos.  If you look at nothing else on this page,  urlLink check this out !  I encourage you to also click on the link for  urlLink A Girl's Bestfriend , which again is strange but fascinating.

      OK, where did all of this freaking snow come from?  I mean, I knew it was supposed to snow a bit, but it is  still  snowing and there's like 3+ inches on the ground.  Poured down buckets all day long.  Anyway, Chris & I went to a couple of shows at the UCB tonight and Chris ran into a classmate & her husband of his there.  And then we met another guy who is taking a level 1 class there under the same teacher that Chris has, but on a different night.  Well, while that doesn't matter to you, they were great shows and (again) if you're ever in NYC, please, PLEASE go see a show at UCB.  So worth the $8.  On 26th Street at 8th Avenue.  You need to make reservations and get there 30 minutes before the show starts.  Alright, since it's getting late, I need to get to bed before I turn into a pumpkin.  Cause I do that you know.

      Nothing much going on today, except it was my friend's birthday today.  She said that she work up all depressed and sad.  I know the feeling since I sometimes fall into the sinkhole myself.  But I think her day turned out to very nice indeed.  As I'm sitting on the N train on my way home today after work, I just watch the other people.  And there are certainly different types.  For instance, there are those who read, listen to music, nap until their stop and instantly pop up when they get to their stop.  But first, we'll explore what I've to come to know as Pole-Huggers.  Pole-Huggers stand right against the pole and lean on it no matter who else is holding the pole.  You sometimes even have to pry your fingers from underneath their squishy bodies.  It grosses me out.  Then there are those who bring things to work on on the train, i.e. cross stitch, crotchet, knit, sew, homework, read papers for work, write in their journals, etc.  Just the other day, this guy from Peru approached me on the platform trying to get directions - only he doesn't speak any English.  Unfortunately, my Spanish stinks to high heaven and even though I somehow conveyed this lack of skill to this guy, he insisted on carrying on a conversation with me.  Ok, so what the hell am I to do at this point.  I figure, "yeah, why not work on my Spanish a little?"  A few words back & forth, not really understanding what's going on, I hop off the train.  This is what happens when you spend 2 years of Spanish not learning Spanish.  Ok, I've exhausted what part of my brain was left over from work today.  I must now go heat up some gumbo that I made yesterday and then plop myself down on the couch to watch some Fear Factor.  Tootles kids.

      Funny thing happened to us on the way to the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) last night.  We're in a cab in Astoria heading for the bridge to Manhattan when my window was struck by an orange.  Yes, an orange.  I'm just thankful that the window didn't shatter.  Fucked up.  Anyway, we went to 2 shows last night at UCB and had a great time.  We had to sit on the floor for the 2nd show and that was fine until about the last 20 minutes.  Pain, pain, pain.  I felt bad for stretching my legs out every now and then, but I really couldn't help it.  All in all, an ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC show!!  So then here I am at home by myself today and I do a few things around the house, i.e. vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, washing dishes and the like.  Then I decide to make some gumbo, so I head down to the grocery store to get supplies.  I buy my groceries and head home, start cutting up onions, bell pepper & celery when it dawns on me that I've forgotten to get sausage.  OK, so back down to the grocery store and find out that they don't have the right kind of sausage.  So I debate on whether to go to another store and then decide to go & it takes me only about 2 minutes to find what I need but 10 minutes to get through the check-out line.  I book it back to the apartment and finish up making the gumbo.  Needless to say, it turned into a bigger ordeal than I thought it would have been.  Well, not too many new links for you today, but there is this:  Want to practice your typing skills in a fun game?   urlLink Click here  - it even has a groovy beat to go with it.

      My sister sent me this file and I wanted to share it with all, but unfortunately, I can't post it.  Just as well I guess since it had some big, big nudity in it.  I then found a link to it on another website, but they've pulled the file.  Go figure.  Nothing too exciting happening this weekend.  Chris & I went out to eat last night at this place called The Brick Oven here in Astoria.  Very nice & quaint.  It was only a 15 minute walk there and back, which hopefully helped burn off some of that dessert!  Now on Comedy Central's Dave Chappelle's show, they did a skit about Rick James.  For all of you fans out there - CHRIS - here's a little something for you.  You can get your own   urlLink I'm Rick James, Bitch!   shirt for a mere $14!  Come on, you know you want one!  And if you have money running out of your ass and your out of fresh ideas for Holloween this year,  urlLink click here  and try Riders.  I can't imagine hopping on the subway wearing this.  This past Halloween we squeezed in next to Jesus complete with cross.  It was a tight squeeze, but we managed it.  I think he grazed my ass at one point, but it was Jesus so what was I to do?  Ok, that's all I have for now.  Until later . . .

      Interesting enough, presidential hopeful John Kerry has made mysterious claims that various foreign leaders are pulling for him to beat GW in November. However, he won't release any names since it might damage their relationship with the current administration. There's an  urlLink article in the Washington Times  about this and how they've checked into his travels over the last year or so and cannot substantiate any meeting that he's had with any foreign leaders. Not only that, they say that no foreign leaders have even been in the same area as Mr. Kerry with one exception though Kerry was not at that meeting. The article goes on to say how 75% of those polled thought that terrorists would be happier with a Kerry win in November.  I'm not trying to make this a political blog by any means, but this whole election year so far just irritates me. If America's image wasn't tarnished enough, the bogus claims by Kerry make us the laughing stock of the world. In the  urlLink Washington Times article , there is this quote by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer: "I think it's probably better to keep foreign leaders and the views of foreign leaders out of domestic elections, I mean, certainly we do that here in this country. I mean, people express different views to you, if you're a candidate, I tend not to pass on those kinds of views publicly."

      OK, well blogger or the internet just ate my post.  Too bad, cause you missed some pretty boring shit.  So now I peruse my usual pages and I happened upon a story of a  urlLink 52-year-old man from Kenya  had not bathed in 10 years.  His odor was so bad, the townspeople hatched a plan to trap him, tie him up and then bathe him.  Well, like the saying goes, it takes a village . . .  For all of you out there fed up with your computer, work, or whatever, here's a little game to help you rid your aggression.  You basically just  urlLink beat the crap out of your virtual computer .

      I forgot to tell you about my embarrassing mishap at work today.  Olivia went downstairs to smoke and her boss comes looking for her to bring 2 coffees to a meeting.  I offer to get the coffee, grab the company coffee mugs & head down the hall for some fresh coffee.  After arranging it all on a small tray, I proceed to one of the conference rooms, see a meeting but can't see who's holding the meeting due to the way he was sitting.  I walk in, realize it's not the meeting I'm looking for but proceed to offer coffee to the 2 guests as our guy is looking at me quizzically and says "no, but that's nice of you to offer."  I then excuse myself and then head off to find the right conference room.  Face turning red.  Laughing to myself.  Looking pretty stupid when you consider that all of the interior walls of the office are glass from the waist up.  Ok, so it's not as funny now that I'm typing it all out, but trust me, it was funny at the time.  Trust me.

      Just in time for Martha, here are the  urlLink 5 cushiest prisons .  And the dumbest Wal-Mart shopper of all time - A woman was caught trying to pass off a fake $1 million bill at Wal-Mart by purchasing over $1,600 worth of merchandise. Now, I know we've all been to Wal-Mart and they scrutinize $100 bills that come through the registers. I find it hard to believe this woman actually thought she could get away with a $1 million dollar bill. After they arrested her, they found 2 more in her purse. And the kicker is that the US Treasury doesn't even produce $1 million bills, though they are available to purchase as souvenirs at some stores.  Ah, yes,  urlLink Men in Kilts .  It's all I've ever wanted in life.  Interesting little website I found here called  urlLink Rebel Holler .  I haven't explore it completely, so feel free to give a shot and let me know in the comments section if it sucks.  It's certainly a little different.  And is it wrong that I want a  urlLink Sperm Toilet Seat ?  And it's like $12.  Who can beat that?  This next site makes me cringe a little.  It's a guy getting shocked by  urlLink 16,600 volts of electricity .  Remind me never to do PCP.  Or you can take a little pop quiz: can you tell which one is a  urlLink female or shemale ?  I got 12 out of 16.  I demand a recount!

      We're having the strangest weather this week. It was all nice and sunny last week - temperatures into the 60's. This week, IT'S SNOWING. And not just some teeny-tiny little snow flurries here and there. Big fat snowflakes! And now it's stopped. Good, since I forgot my umbrella today.  On the work front, I've finally gotten most of the tax forms faxed off to the 50-something people who requested them. Unfortunately, my boss dumped a whole load of stuff on the production department (which are requests for presentation materials - like 20 copies of each in color). Most of the people in that department are cussing him about now. One girl is so busy (& upset) she won't even look at me since I'm his messenger. And I think he's just informed me in a roundabout way that I may be staying late to help him get something done since he'll be out the rest of the week. On top of that, I still have to go over to my friend's apt in Sunnyside (Queens) to feed her cat. She had to fly home to take care of her mom who broke her hip while her dad goes to the funeral of his wife's brother. Follow me? Tends to get a little confusing at times. I guess this means that Chris will have to start the dinner we were supposed to make last night. Lucky Chris. Oh! And on top of that big pile of crap, I'm exhausted again today. I can feel that pain between my shoulders again.  Pretty cool  urlLink blog by a fellow NY'er .

      Another grueling day at the office.  It started off by some investor screaming at me on the phone.  I was proud of myself as I held my tongue instead of telling him to "F*ck off!"  Then, as I'm trying to hole punch the 3000+ pages of tax forms, I jammed the electric hole punch and ended up having to cut my papers out of it.  Then it was off to email a request for duplicates for these destroyed forms.  Great day, great day!  On the plus side:  TODAY IS DAWN'S BIRTHDAY!!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CORN NUT!  Tee hee!!  Anyway, there weren't too many exciting things today.  I'm so completely exhausted I could lie down and cry.  And now I have to go do the dishes and then help Chris make dinner.  We're trying out some pork stirfry tonight.  Don't know how it will work out.  OK, to dishes & dinner . . .

      Well, not much news on this Saturday.  Chris, Sergio & I went to Best Buy, Game Stop & Sports Authority today in Sunnyside.  I picked up some workout clothes & a new sports bra along with a jump rope.  Sergio says that jumping rope will be lower impact than running, so I'm giving it try.  Only problem is that I'll have to go outside to jump rope since it's 9 feet long and hits everything/one around me in the living room.  NYC apartments are a little small for my tastes.  Then, we picked up Jackson on our way back to the apartment.  He's spending the night with us while his mom goes out on a date.  She'll pick him up sometime tomorrow.  So once we got here, we ordered pizza and watched  School of Rock  with Jack Black.  Cute movie and a must have for the teenage'd ones in your life.  That's my day in a nutshell - sadly I'm not leaving much out.  It's been that slow today.  And now I need to go scoop out Berg's litterbox so he doesn't dig a whole into the basement.

      Eeek! Yucky day here in the Big Apple. The buildings have all but disappeared across the street due to the fog. Everyone around me seems to be in a funky mood, including me. And it seems to be affecting my typing abilities. I could use a massage for sure. Chris & Sergio went out again last night for what has become their weekly ritual. They didn't get home until 5:30 am so I can only guess that they had a good time. Since I always have to work the next morning, I'm never invited to these little soirées. Oh, well. Don't cry over spilled milk, right?  I had the strangest dream last night. I was at a restaurant going up a set of stairs meant for the waitstaff (cause the elevator was broken) but on my way up, I changed my mind and headed back down. Then all of a sudden I was riding the stairs, which had turned into a Ferris wheel. There was some guy standing below smiling watching me ride and we were talking as I went past. Then I woke up. Don't know what that was all about.  Anyway, I wrote my rent check to Chris last night and on the memo line, I wrote "for sexual favors." He hasn't noticed yet, but I'm hoping that he does before he deposits the check today. Maybe someone at the bank will notice and give him a funny look. Tee Hee!! Goodness! We're supposed to go watch Starsky & Hutch this evening when I get home. Can't wait!! I love a good Ben Stiller/Owen Wilson movie!  My friend Olivia, who I work with, just walked by with her monkey wrapped up in her pashmina - or cape as we like to call it. (I guess I should first explain that she has a sock monkey that sits on her desk here at work.) I wished her and her new arrival well. She says she's going to breast feed him.  And something a little different: My 5 Gratitudes for Today:  1. Seeing my husband passed out in bed (finally) and he's still mostly on his side 2. The first sip of coffee this morning 3. Stepping outside at lunch to get a cup of 5-star gourmet chili for $6 4. Walking into my apt after a long day at work 5. Climbing into bed next to my hunny!

      Chris & I have started to go walking after work now that the weather is getting warmer.  We'd have gone running today, but I've just been way too tired after work for the last couple of days.  Next week.    So anyway, there's a lot of talk about how many of the widows from 9/11 are upset at Bush because he uses images of the destroyed WTC in a campaign commercial.  I find this issue a little tricky: it was certainly a historical event that took place during Bush's administration that he handled well, however it's wrong to use this personal tradegy as a political platform.  I would say that it seems like they could have found another way to tie the two together without using those images, but I went to the website and watched the video (entitled  urlLink Safer, Stronger ) and it's very well done and only on the screen for like 2 seconds.  I don't find it offensive at all, but then again, I didn't personally lose anyone on that Tuesday.  I was here that day and I can't say that it didn't effect me in a lingering way - still does to this day.  But Bush & Kerry are tied in  urlLink today's polls  and like I said yesterday, things are going to get nasty this year.  Well, in Texas, a woman gave  urlLink birth to her own grandchildren .  I guess it had to happen in the South, didn't it?  And I know I shouldn't find this funny, but I can't help but laugh! Seniors at a  urlLink retirement home in Florida  got into a fight at the salad bar over lettuce. Three people were hurt and had to be taken to the hospital for minor injuries - but it's just funny darn it!  This next one is just neat.  It's one of those things that would be fun to have, but you wouldn't want to admit spending money on.  Ooo!  I think  urlLink I want one !  And for the  urlLink courageous hampster  that is in a better place now.  May the dumbasses who launched you into the air have a backup plan next time around.  Can you imagine having a  urlLink famous feces  picture frame sitting on your desk at work?  OK, maybe not at work.  Alright, gonna go watch Friends, Will & Grace, The Apprentice, and Scrubs.  Later Gators.

      I've gone and done the unthinkable - I now have a piece of clothing that is pink. Only it's not too pink, but rather mauve. At least that's my story.  I can't believe I'm wearing pink - and I've actually gotten a load of compliments on it, too. Damn pink skirt. Now I'm going to have to wear it more often.  So I'm getting ready for work this morning and listening to the  urlLink news  when I hear this atrocious story of a 20-year-old woman in the Bronx whose heart was cut out after turning down her boyfriend's marriage proposal on Valentine's Day. Can you say fecked up? Also, in the news, it seems we'll be seeing a Kerry/Bush face-off later this year in the  presidential elections. I guess I can't say that I didn't see that one coming. Still doesn't mean that I like Kerry all that much.   It seems that an individual or group is trying to  urlLink blackmail the French government . They sent a letter saying there were 10 bombs hidden throughout the state-run railway system and they would be detonated unless they were paid over $5 million. French police have already discovered one of the bombs and defused it saying that it was a very sophisticated bomb. All I can say is that I hope they find all of those bombs before we roll through there in September.

      Well boys & girls, I've finally found out that Dick Clark is 74 years old!  The world's oldest teenager they call him. I wonder just how much work he's had done . . . Oh well, I'm sure Joan Rivers is catching up to him anyway.  Nothing really new on this fine day here in the Big Apple. I read Court's blog and I found her French wedding experience very interesting indeed. I can't believe that they start the reception so late in the evening - and there are 2 of them! Oh! And the fact that marriage is a civil union at the courthouse with no big frills - onto the religious ceremony with barely any frills. They must save it all for that 2nd reception that lasts until the break of dawn.  Big shout out to one of my favorite new blogs:  urlLink Rita ! Kick ass stuff girl, kick ass! Don't know if I'd ever give possum stew a try, but you never know just what you'll eat when you're hungry enough - or you don't know what that mystery meat is in the stew.

      I wanted to get on the computer yesterday to post, but I was busier than a one-armed paperhanger. And I don't know why I'm so frustrated today, but I think it's going to get better as the day goes on. It is so absolutely beautiful outside today that I don't see how I could stay in a rotten mood. Normally, I go downstairs to get lunch and then come right back to my desk to eat, but I just couldn't today. So Dawn and I ate outside at Rockefeller Center right next to the skating rink, but above 1 level. Beautiful!!  So I went to see The Passion of the Christ again yesterday and it is a phenomenal movie. Please go see this movie! If nothing else, it brings a human aspect to the story of Christ - something that I think was missing during all of my years in catechism. Some people cried, some didn't, some flinched each time Jesus was beaten, some didn't, and some couldn't  take it at all and left the theater. Each moviegoer had a different experience and this is the type of movie that makes you reflect. Just what a good - I mean GREAT - movie should do. Fantastic job, Mel Gibson, fantastic job!  Good news is you are obese and you've done something drastic to help lower your weight - you can  urlLink deduct it from your taxes ! But since I'm not a tax consultant, please don't reference this site when you get a knock on your door from the IRS. You are not my child and I will not take responsibility for your tax shortcomings. Frankly, the IRS scares the hell out of me.  Here's something you don't see everyday: A town in Vermont,  urlLink Killington , wants to succeed from Vermont and join New Hampshire. Wild! I haven't heard of any sort of succession since the Civil War, and well, technically, I didn't hear that directly.

      I love Thursdays!  And even though it's payday, I'm still broke since my rent money comes out of this paycheck.  And to top it all off, I opened up our rent invoice and our monthly rent went up by $98.  No notice or anything which pretty much sucks.  Rent nearly kills me & I hear they may raise subway fares!  They're bleeding us dry!  NYC had a budget surplus of like $4 million at least - you'd think they would help the straphangers out since they raised fares not even a year ago!  Ahhh!  Geez!!  Assholes!  Whew!  I'm glad I got that off my chest!  Berg is being evil as usual.  He's scratching on the chair, the movies on the shelf, the couch, the front door, the closet door, the mattress - everywhere except one of his two scratching posts.  Go figure.  Chris & Sergio are going out tonight to The Whiskey Bar.  Chris hasn't been in a couple of weeks.  It was time.  I've been telling Chris that he needs to go to the doctor for his chronic indigestion.  He has stubbornly refused.  As a matter of fact, we just went back and forth with me trying to get him to go and him saying, "I don't want to go because of needles.  If they can do something without needles, I'll definitely go."  At this point, I assured him that there's a really good chance they won't have to draw blood or anything, but since I didn't say "100% sure," that's not really good enough for him.  I was turned down.  He's stubborn and hard-headed for sure.

He's even modeled the gown himself and his comments are absolutely hilarious.  Please,  urlLink go and enjoy !  You'll love it, too!  Not so much happening today.  We went to the UCB last night and it was hilarious!  We stayed for 1 1/2 shows - I was getting a little ancy(sp?) toward the end.  Today, Chris signed up for his Level 2 classes at UCB.  His graduation performance is in a couple of weeks & I know he'll do great!  I'm proud of him for taking these classes because he truly enjoys them.    The book list that is going about:  I've seen it on a couple different blogs. I got it from  urlLink Sheila O'Malley .  If you want to play, just post the list on your own site, putting the titles you have read in bold.   Beowulf  Achebe, Chinua - Things Fall Apart Agee, James - A Death in the Family Austen, Jane - Pride and Prejudice Baldwin, James - Go Tell It on the Mountain Beckett, Samuel - Waiting for Godot Bellow, Saul - The Adventures of Augie March  Brontë, Charlotte - Jane Eyre   Brontë, Emily - Wuthering Heights  Camus, Albert - The Stranger Cather, Willa - Death Comes for the Archbishop  Chaucer, Geoffrey - The Canterbury Tales  Chekhov, Anton - The Cherry Orchard Chopin, Kate - The Awakening Conrad, Joseph - Heart of Darkness Cooper, James Fenimore - The Last of the Mohicans  Crane, Stephen - The Red Badge of Courage Dante - Inferno de Cervantes, Miguel - Don Quixote Defoe, Daniel - Robinson Crusoe Dickens, Charles - A Tale of Two Cities Dostoyevsky, Fyodor - Crime and Punishment Douglass, Frederick - Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Dreiser, Theodore - An American Tragedy Dumas, Alexandre - The Three Musketeers Eliot, George - The Mill on the Floss Ellison, Ralph - Invisible Man  Emerson, Ralph Waldo - Selected Essays  Faulkner, William - As I Lay Dying Faulkner, William - The Sound and the Fury Fielding, Henry - Tom Jones  Fitzgerald, F.

      Here's a little something you don't see in the news these days:  urlLink Explorers are planning a quest to Turkey's Mt. Ararat in search of Noah's Ark . Biblical stories have placed the Ark near this location, however, past expeditions never turned up any evidence. Then in last summer's heat wave that hit Europe, "a mammoth structure" was exposed and thanks to satellite imagery, they've been able to pinpoint a more exact location. I think it would be very exciting if they found a boat-like structure up there. It would certainly boost a lot of people's faith.  I was reading on ABCnews.com about a family of 7 who eats on less than $12/day. They now actually run a business from their home that teaches others how to do the same thing. I found it an interesting read, so  urlLink click here  to read their story or  urlLink click here  to go straight to their website.   And I just read this story on  urlLink CNN.com  about a guy who is attending NYU, but couldn't afford to pay a $1000 housing deposit so he's been living in one of the school's libraries for the last 8 months. He kept an online journal ( urlLink homelessatnyu.com ), which is how school officials discovered him and then moved him to a free dorm room. Very interesting since I read a book not that long ago where a girl lived in the school library as well.  There is a report our on  urlLink SmokingGun.com  about an assistant writer for "Friends" who has filed a lawsuit against 3 of the writers. She claimed they were lewd in their actions and comments and frequently spoke of the actors/actresses in a lewd (read sexual) fashion. But, please, go check it out for yourself.  Ok, so now Chris & I are off to go to Herald Night at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater.  It's a cheap night of hilarious entertainment - only $5 per person during the week & only $8 per person on the weekends.  I can't think of anything cheaper in NYC.  Except for my Goodwill Dress.  About 4 years ago, Easter snuck up on me and I didn't have a dress to wear or really any money to buy it with.  I could have asked my Mom & Dad to buy me one, but I thought I should at least give it a shot.  I stopped by Goodwill looking for a cool purse, throw pillows or scarves when I glanced at the rack of dresses.  I found a nice little red dress that is sleeveless with a red paisley design on a chiffon-like material over a red sheath that goes to my knees.  Marked at $5 (read: affordable), I brought it to the register and low & behold, it's on sale 1/2 price.  That's right, my $5 dress was now a mere $2.50.  I still own that red dress and I get compliments every time I wear it.  It's probably the cheapest since item of clothing that I have & it's what I get the most compliments on.  I'm confused.  I still wear it because it's so comfortable and is wrinkle resistant.  I can ball it up, toss it in a bag and it's fine.  Again, confused but I'm Ok with that.  It's my Goodwill Dress.

      I would just like to celebrate the fact that I am now a SLIMY MOLLUSC in the Blogosphere!!  And that's all I can say about that for now.  I wanted to post all of the different levels, but I'm too tired to look.  Not much happening in the wide world of Cooper today.  It got cold again - go figure.  I wish it would just turn warm already!  I'm tired of this cold, overcast, rainy crap that is 2004.  OK, I have to go start dinner because Chris is refusing to do anything until I'm standing next to him breathing on his neck.  And since I'm pretty damn hungry and he's cutting the chicken, I have to make a choice here . . .

      Well, instead of SoHo/East Village, Chris & I wandered aimlessly around Greenwich Village.  I absolutely love this part of the city.  It just has an energy to it that our current neighborhood in Astoria (or all of Queens for that matter) simply lacks.  One of the things Chris received when his grandmother passed away was an old pipe that his grandfather used to smoke.  So while we wandered around yesterday, he picked up a pack of vanilla pipe tobacco along with one of those little cleaning tools.  He smoked when he got home.  It didn't stink like most pipes stink thanks to the vanilla, though I must say that it was a little weird to see him smoke a pipe.  While we were out and about yesterday, we also explored the shops at the new Time Warner Center.  Nice place and very clean.  That's about all I have to say about that.  Most stores exceeded my budget.  We went into one lady's clothing store where everything was somewhat expensive, but what I noticed is that for as costly as they were, most of them were falling apart.  Call me crazy, but why would I pay $425 for a sun dress when the straps are no longer attached the garment and the ends are now all frayed.  Perhaps their manager should do a floor check and weed out some of the damaged pieces.  Perhaps I simply won't shop there & I shouldn't worry about it.  Now today, Amanda and I are supposed to go to Herald Square to find her something to wear to her sister's baby shower.  After that, we might go see Jersey Girl.  Ok, so I need to go take a shower now & rid myself of this funk.

      Chris & I went to see Kill Bill: Vol 2 last night and it was great!  Not as bloody as the first one, but it tied up all ends in a nice little package.  I definitely recommend it, but please watch Vol. 1 before seeing Vol. 2.  That's just the way these things work, people.  Weekend Links:   urlLink Classic SNL skit on how to deal with your child being gay .  Hilarious!  Now here are a series of cartoons by the creators of South Park - need I say they are dirty, contain nudity & obviously not appropriate to watch during "working hours" unless of course you think you're a badass and can get away with it.  Just remember: the IT department is watching!!   urlLink Cartoon #1    urlLink Cartoon #2   And now for something you can share with your whole family:  urlLink Escher's "Relativity" in Legos .  Pretty cool, but I wonder how long it took them to do this.  I'm sure I'm going to hell for putting this next link on here, but I simply couldn't resist.  It's the  urlLink Jesus Christ action figure playset .  Cross not included.   urlLink THE WARNING SIGNS OF MASTURBATION .  Sponsored by your local White House.  What frightens me on this one is that this website looks so official, yet very obvious it's completely satirical.  Please correct me if I'm wrong on this one.  OK, that's enough for today.  Hopefully more links will follow tomorrow.  Today's plan is to wander aimlessly around the SoHo/East Village part of Manhattan today since it is such a beautiful day!  Get out & enjoy the nice weather!

      Talk to me baby Say something nice Talk to me honey I need your advice  Never mind fortune Never mind fame I don't wear diamonds I don't drink champagne  So, what's that song?  Can you guess it?  Let's see if anyone gets this one right.  Otherwise, I'm sitting here wasting some time.  I need to do laundry tonight, but it was kind of busy at the laudromat when I walked past it on my way home.  So I figure I'll wait until about 6:45 or 7 pm and then give it a shot.  Last night & tonight are free dryer nights so there are always tons of people fighting for dryers.  You only save like $2 to $3 and I would rather pay extra so I don't have to fight others for machines, but we are completely out of towels and my underwear selection is starting to thin out.  Interestingly enough, I was having this same conversation with one of my coworkers and she said that she only does laundry like once a month.  My jaw nearly hit the floor, but she explained that most of their clothes go to the dry cleaner.  Insane!  I wish I only had to do laundry once a month, but then I would hate to see my dry cleaner bill.  Chris is napping on the couch after having a late night.  He only got like 3 hours of sleep before he dragged himself (with my help) out of bed and into the shower.  I've been up since before 5 am, but I don't do naps well.  I usually wake up very cranky & moody and then I just feel like shit.  He also had one too many whiskeys.  I've certainly been there before.  "Dear God, please don't let me throw up.  I promise I won't drink on an empty stomach again."  I'm sure I've heard those words come out of my mouth at least once . . .  Ok, off to do laundry.  Wish me luck!

      Ok, so I have another new layout.  Drop me a comment if you can't read the text or if you have any other problems.  And I added pictures to the Gallery 3 link on the right from Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah's trip.  I'm afraid the text will have to come later since I'm having trouble with the text editor for that website.

      So not much happening tonight.  Chris went to Peter Luger's Steakhouse in Brooklyn with some of his friends from the hotel.  I opted out tonight since 1) I wasn't aware it was tonight, and 2) I really didn't feel like going.  I'm still recovering from this weekend.  I feel kind of bad for not going, but I really was somewhat blindsided by it even though Chris insists that he told me about this on Saturday.  Unfortunately, I was busier than a one armed paper hanger on Saturday.     urlLink This link  will make you somewhat crazy.  Don't really know what it has to do with epilepsy, but that's what the site says anyway.  Well, the  urlLink world's oldest mouse  celebrated his 4th birthday this past Saturday.  He is the equivalent of 136 in human years.  Happy Birthday Yoda!  And as it turns out,  urlLink Abe Vigoda is alive  today.  Who'd have guessed?  This next story tugs at my heart.  This cat now named  urlLink China, was trapped in a cardboard shipping box  for 30 days.  It somehow got trapped in a box that contained bird cages from China.  It traveled by ship to the West Coast and then by rail to Tampa where it was found.  When they brought it to the vet, it only weighed about 3 pounds.  Yes, I'm a cat person.  Here are more  urlLink pictures  from someone who had spare time and photoshop on their computer.  Interesting & freaky all at the same time - especially the  urlLink 4th picture down .    And finally, here is some of the  urlLink coolest code art ever !  Just click on the names on the left.  Cool, huh?  Oh!  I simply cannot leave without singing the praises of this group of  urlLink Roman Catholic schoolgirls .  I guess they were tired of looking at his willie.

      I would say "sorry" for the lack of posts, but I've had a damn good time with my guests since they got here on Thursday.  Now our apartment is entirely too quiet so Chris has decided to run his power tools to help mask the void.  Ruthie (Chris's mom), Cacky (his sister), and Savannah (Cacky's youngest at 16 months) came in on Thursday afternoon.  Once they got here, we visited a bit and made dinner.  Then we had us a little ceremony of sorts.  When Chris's grandmother passed away, they divided her belongings amongst the children.  In the end, they had some of her jewelry that they turned into rings for the granddaughters - and I got one, too.  Mine is a ruby that came from a 40-Anniversary wedding gift that her husband gave her.  It's so pretty and I'm very touched that I was included cause one day, I hope to have a little girl to pass along the ring.  I love sentimental gifts.  They mean more than any expensive gift in some bright shiny store.  Chris also received his granddaddy's walking cane and some of his watches.  During their stay, we hit Chinatown up to Prince Street, Columbus Circle, Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Central Park (picnic), Rockefeller Center/Midtown area, Jeckyl & Hyde Club, City Lobster & Crab Company, The Brooklyn Diner, Ricky's (adult store - and yes, purchases were made but those stories shall be told another time), The Upright Citizens Brigade, and shopping, shopping, shopping & shopping!!!  They left the apartment at 4:15 this morning.  I miss them already, but Berg is really upset he doesn't have his choice of luggage to lay on and roll around.  He's currently taking out his aggression on one of my chairs.  The bastard.  By the way, I will be changing the layout soon to something that everyone can read.  Ok, I have to go watch the end of Fear Factor - they had to do some pretty disgusting stuff on Day Two.

      We just booked our trip to Italy baby!!  Whoo hoo!!  3 nights in Rome, 3 nights in Florence & 3 nights in Venice!  I'm so excited!  Neither Chris nor I have been to Europe - or taken a vacation together for that matter.  This will be just after our 2 year anniversary.  Yeah!!  Interesting little tidbit: the national debt clock that hangs in Union Square here in NYC has been taken down. The building where it was hung is being demolished. It will be replaced with a new higher-tech clock next month and hung about a block north. When the clock was taken down, the national debt was more than $7 trillion.  Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah are coming tomorrow!! I so can't wait! Bring on the Yaya good times!!  I've recently discovered (about a month ago)  urlLink this website  that is more political than I'll ever be on my site.  I've enjoyed  urlLink his posts  so far. His post today is about John Kerry and the purple hearts he received for injuries while serving in the military. Check it out. I think you'll definitely see Kerry in a new light; an unflattering new light.  I stopped by  urlLink Dooce's  site today and read about how she is going through postpartum depression. After reading her story, my heart goes out to her. I wish there was some way that I could help out. After reading her blog everyday, I feel like I know her. I simply wish there was an easy fix for depression, but I know there isn't. I must say that's something that scares me about getting pregnant. I've gone through my own funk a time or two, but never to the extent that she has. But she's a strong person and she'll make it through and then teach us all a lesson in return.  Not much else is happening here in my little world. It's been raining since Monday. I'll be going to pick up our visitors tomorrow from the airport. Chris will have to meet us at the apartment cause he won't make it to the airport in time. My only concern is that the 2-hour live season finale of The Apprentice is tomorrow night and I desperately want to watch it. I may have to tape it, if the boys aren't playing video games. I seriously hope they're not playing video games.

      I'm not sure if anyone caught the Nick & Jessica Variety Show on Sunday night, but I did. I think the thing that drew me in was that I missed out on the heydays of variety shows. I was too young. So I watched with baited breath and I laughed at times and other times I realized it was all a little corny. But now that I've seen the first show, I'm wondering what they'll do different for the next show. Since it comes on Sunday nights, I'm sure I'll be watching it again due to the lack of quality programming offered during that timeslot. If you haven't watched it, check it out and let me know what you think. I read an article on MSNBC.com this morning that said the show was the highest rated during that timeslot Sunday night. Should be interesting to see if they can pull it off again.  Anyway, Chris & I went to Bed Bath & Beyond after I got off work today.  Bought us: a halogen lamp (all brushed steel like), a fogless shower mirror so we can stare at ourselves at random, 3 ice cube trays, a can opener that cuts the can so there are no sharp edges (of course), and some hangers for my skirts (cause I can't wear pants to work).  At just under $150 later, we took a cab home.  The cabbie had such horrible body odor that I almost choked.  Which reminds me, this guy sat next to me on the train this morning and he smelled like vinegar and eggs.  N-A-S-T-Y!  Nasty!!

It's really cool and I think I'll do it in a few days time.  Need to think of something to say so I don't sound like a complete dork.  If you're interested,  urlLink click here  and then click on the link to listen to  urlLink Ann of In A Puddle .  She'll give you instructions.  Hope to hear you soon!!

This is pretty cool cause the  urlLink bunny  won't let go of your cursor until you shake him off.  Appropriate for Easter I think.  Then, of course, there is the  urlLink milk rap commercial  brought to you by the dairy farmers of Ontario.  Unique to say the least.  Takes a bit to load, but funny.  This must be one of the best  urlLink rush posters  I've seen.  Leave it to the  urlLink TKE's .  And if you'd like to know the difference between Europeans and Italians, just  urlLink click here .  OK, that's it cause there weren't that many good ones today.  HAPPY EASTER!

       urlLink Interesting .  I can't even think of anything else to describe, but I couldn't watch for too long or my eyeballs were gonna fall out.   urlLink Cool, though, very cool .  If only my office was the kind where we could pull something like  urlLink this .  Awesome guys!  Awesome!  Cool video of a  urlLink one-legged guy dancing his ass off .  He does more with one leg than most white people do with two.  And this is a totally gross " urlLink brief safe " complete with skid marks.  Fantastic!  This - This is insane!  It's a  urlLink thorax cake  which bled different sauces.  Here's hoping someone I know will be incredibly cool and make this one day because they have nothing better to do with their time.  Seems like it would take quite a while to do.  Ok, off to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

      Do you know your  urlLink pimp name ?  I do.  My  urlLink pimp name  is  Macktastic empress Dogg  - and don't you forget it.  And while we're at it, do you know your  urlLink porn name ?  Surprisingly, I do.  My porn name is  Honey Lips , but then I chose a random identity and got  Serenity Fox , which I like too.  If Chris ever gets a hairy chest, I'm doing  urlLink this  to him.  I found this cool website for a hotel in Berlin that has the coolest rooms!  Check it out by  urlLink clicking here .  Awesome, isn't it?   I personally found  urlLink this  a little offensive since it resembles Berg, but others may  urlLink find it funny .  And then, of course, there is  urlLink Dionne Warwick's Cosmic Peephole .  Fun and doesn't cost a thing.  This is a pretty  urlLink funny beer ad  that I don't think I've ever seen on TV.  Enjoy!  If only beers really did that.  Takes a little bit to load, but worth it.

      Stomach growling, feeling faint, must eat soon . . . so, I'm a little hungry and about to make some chicken alfredo pasta cause I'm a badass.  And Chris will love it - except that I forgot to get the kind of pasta that he loves, but tough shit.  I'm not getting dressed again to go back down to the store in the cold and the wind.  April in NYC - ain't it grand?  While I'm sitting here typing, The Rock is on Conan O'Brien and it reminded me to tell everyone: Chris met The Rock last week when he was staying at The Mandarin Oriental (hotel).  Interestingly enough, he checked in under the name of "Mr. Cook."  He only stayed like 1 night and then moved on.  I could eat him with a spoon!  Visitor update: Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah are coming up on the 15th for 4 days.  Becca & Trevor are coming up at the end of May for her 21st birthday.  Then, Brad & Adrianna are coming up at the end of June and, last but not least, there is a possibility that we'll get to see our friend Hiroshi after summer when he flies in from Las Vegas to visit a friend here in NYC.  That's it so far this year.    Oh!  The piece de resistance (of course) is our upcoming trip to Italy.  We've finally narrowed it down to staying in just Italy: 3 days in Rome, 3 days in Florence (with a day trip to Pisa), and 3 days in Venice.  I SO can't wait!  Chris and I have never been to Europe - hell, I don't think we've ever really taken a trip together by ourselves!  And that's saying a lot considering we've been together for 9 years (married 2 and a half years).  Ok, off to make dinner so I can EAT!!

      I'm doing my laundry today and the laundromat is 2 1/2 blocks away.  A few moments ago, I went back to put the clothes into the dryer.  On my way, this old man comes out of his apartment building wearing NOTHING but a thin navy blue robe.  NOTHING else.  NOTHING.  Anyway, he then asks me if I wanted to come clean his apartment.  I declined and told him I was doing my laundry, but thanks anyway.  So he asks me if I wanted to come do laundry in his apartment.  Ok, so "No thanks, I'm kind of busy.  But thanks."  WTF?!?

      Well, the Met was great!  If you're ever in NYC, it's a must see - even before the American History Museum, which is usually packed to capacity.  The Met was easier to get into (shorter lines) and they have a coat check.  Very nice!  Chris & I spent 3 hours there and only saw part of the 1st floor and a very small part of the 2nd floor.  But one of the places we saw on the 2nd floor was just row after row of objects behind glass.  There was virtually no one else up there and it almost felt like we weren't supposed to be there.  Like we discovered some secret part of the museum.  It was absolutely fantastic - and this from someone who's not a big "art" fan, but it certainly wasn't just paintings.  There was so much more!  Anyway, more on that later.  I'm sill downloading pictures and I hope to post some to one of the picture galleries.  Of course since everything was pretty much behind glass, you'll see our reflections in a few of them.  Oh!  And it was cool in the American Wing portion because they had these rooms that you could walk through that were set up just like those that would be typical of Virginia or Massachusetts or Maine in the late 1800's.  Gorgeous!!  Ok, enough!  Cause here are your links!!!  I know you're smiling and that makes me happy!  So, here you go:  This is just a strange story - almost sci-fi like:  urlLink Woman Grows Extra Breasts .  And not in a good way either!  And now,  urlLink The Rainbow Plucking Orgy .  This was a children's cartoon that was broadcast in the 70's and 80's.  I think it has a completely different connotation now and certainly wouldn't have made it on air.  It's hard to keep a straight face watching it.  OK, that's all for now.  I need to go do laundry.  More later.

      If I can get Chris out of bed, showered & dressed, then we're going to the Metropolitan Musuem of Art today.  Don't think I'm being cruel - this was his idea.  He went to go see Hellboy last night and I opted to sit out of this one.  For some reason, comic book movies simply don't grab me.  I'm sure I'm not the only soul walking the planet who thinks this way.  Wow!  I just woke the man up!  Time for some morning lovin'!  After he brushes his teeth that is.

      Some great links for ya:   urlLink The Excorcist in 30 seconds - with bunnies .  Absolutely fantastic & hilarious, but I'd suggest turning the volume down on your computer lest you go deaf.  I'm sure most parents discourage  urlLink playing with food , but this I might actually encourage.  Don't know what this article is actually about since the headline is the coolest part!!   urlLink Click here !   urlLink Check out this link .  That's right!  They have hyenas on leashes.  Yep, hyenas.  And if you haven't been able to  urlLink slap a ho  in a while, have no fear - just  urlLink click here .  I, myself, am a Super Pimp!  Beat that!  And I'm sorry, Chris, but this is the  urlLink biggest penis  I think I've ever seen!  Even bigger than that donkey's penis in front of Mrs. Jackie's house!  This is kinda fun for all of you familiar with the hip hop world.  It's the  urlLink Hip Hop Adventure !  Ok, I think you've had enough for today.  But I couldn't leave you with the last link, so here you go.   urlLink I think I want this for my birthday !  December 1st (hint, hint!!)  It'll make the work day go faster!

      I've been working at the same job for the last 2 years and 8 months. I'm basically the middle-manwoman for an investment portfolio. 75% of the investors in this portfolio are elderly and when they call up for information or forms, they expect things to be done rather quickly because, as they often remind me, they may die soon. At this point, they usually pause and I really never know what to say: "Yep, so you'd better hurry up and cash that check. You could die later today even!" Yeah, that never really seems to blow over, so I usually just give them a monotone "Yes sir or Yes ma'am" and leave it at that. Every once in a while, I get a screamer on the phone. This person wants to know why they don't get more money and why I'm not doing something about them getting more money - all while screaming angrily into the phone. I've even been cussed at.  I had a nice change from the norm the other day when a 75-year-old lady called me to change the name on her account. She was telling me all about her friend of 31 years who passed away and all of the things they used to do. She was laughing and carrying on; I must have talked to her for 30 minutes. Well, when she sent the paperwork back to me, it smelled of stale cigarettes but it also included a nice card. She wrote that it was the first time she laughed in 6 months. Made me feel all nice and gooey inside. I think I'll frame that card.  I got this next little funny from  urlLink DaGoddess  and I simply couldn't resist since it made me laugh out loud at my computer monitor. Needless to say, I got a few strange looks! Here goes:  It was opening night at the Orpheum and the Amazing Claude was topping the bill. People came from miles around to see the famed hypnotist do his stuff. As Claude took to the stage, he announced, "Unlike most stage hypnotists who invite two or three people up onto the stage to be put into a trance, I intend to hypnotize each and every member of the audience."  The excitement was almost electric as Claude withdrew a beautiful antique pocket watch from his coat. "I want you each to keep your eye on this antique watch. It's a very special watch. It's been in my family for six generations."  He began to swinging the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting, "Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch . . . ."  The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until suddenly, it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces. "Shit!" said they hypnotist.  It took three weeks to clean up the theater.

      I'm fucked up!  And Chris the Great is turning the AC on cause he's a badass.  Today is Becca's birthday.  A Marine bought us each a shot of Yagermeister (sp?) and I think we're all fucked up!  And my  brother-in-law, John, is a badass, too!  Anyway, after the Met, we went to PJ Carnie's and had a couple of drinks a few appetizers.  Then, we went to Faces & Names and had a few more drinks and a dish of curly fries.  That's when the Marine bought us the drinks.   We've had a good day & I must go since I can't type cause I'm too fucked up!  Later gators!!

      My little sister is here!!  Which is why I haven't posted since Wednesday.  Well, that's not entirely true.  On Thursday night, we had a going away party for a couple of people at work.  I would have done fine with my Corona beers until the shot of Yagermeister & the shot of Jack Daniel's.  It's the shots that kick my ass.  So I was late for work on Friday, but I get points for at least making it.  Right?  Yeah, well, points for me anyway!  Becca and Trevor came in Friday evening around 6 pm and then hit Times Square, Rockefeller Center & walked up 5th Avenue up to Central Park South.  We've also seen Battery Park, the WTC site, the Wall Street Bull, Chinatown, SoHo, the East Village, Central Park, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, and Grand Central.  And today:  HAPPY 21st BIRTHDAY BECCA!!  So today, we're obviously going to do a little drinking after we go to The Met (museum).  I made her some chocolate cupcakes for breakfast & her boyfriend, Trevor, just went and got her some flowers - she's in the shower right now so she'll be surprised when she gets out.  OK, gotta go!

      I can't decide if this is a  urlLink music video or porn , so please, judge for yourself.  This is not appropriate for work or small children & you need volume for the full affect.  I just don't know what to say about it.  Please, someone give me that word I'm so desperately looking for here . . . something besides  urlLink Tralala .  And following along the same lines, here's this  urlLink snazzy ad for a cell phone company .  Nice work, guys, nice work.  And  urlLink this is fantastic !  It makes me want to get up and dance just like that!

      Tonight is the big finale for American Idol. I didn't watch the first 2 seasons and the only reason I tuned in this season was because they cancelled Buffy. So really, what's a girl to do?   I couldn't let this headline pass by without comment:  urlLink Spanky the Circus Clown Charged With Child Porn . Ok, I think the name "Spanky" should have sent up red flags to start with.  I just tried to get our passports and had one of the most confusing conversations I think I've ever had.  I think I might need to get my hearing checked.  That's probably my problem right there, but I'm actually afraid I'll need hearing aids or something & I'm just too young for that.  It's really frustrating when you can't hear people.  I think I know how my Dad feels sometimes.  Anyway, I did the unthinkable yesterday: I unleashed Chris the Great in Best Buy unsupervised.  I don't know what I was thinking.  He came back with one movie in particular:  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep .  It was one of the craziest, funniest movies I've seen in a long time!  I'd recap, but I'm not sure I would even know where to start.  It's a great movie so go see it!!  I just went to  urlLink Rita's site , took  urlLink this quiz  and found out that I'm a CENTRIST, which means: Centrists favor selective government intervention and emphasize practical solutions to current problems. They tend to keep an open mind on new issues. Many centrists feel that government serves as a check on excessive liberty.    Ok, so now what?

      I saw a poll on CNN.com that asked who had a better plan for Iraq: Bush, Kerry or Nader. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Kerry hasn't even announced a plan for Iraq, has he? If so, I haven't heard a single thing about it.  After stopping off at  urlLink Rita's  site, I came across  urlLink this article and photo . Sponsored by MoveOn.org, it has (of course) been linked to the Kerry campaign which doesn't surprise me. I can tell you now I'll probably never ever support MoveOn - especially after seeing this bullshit.  That's it!! I don't know what's wrong with the world today! I couldn't believe my eyes when I read that  urlLink Western Washington University cancelled its annual Pornfest . I mean, what's wrong with us if we can't enjoy a little porn in a group setting? Who else will sponsor condom hunts and self-gratification information booths?!?

      Since I didn't get a chance to post last night, you get an early bird post.  Unfortunately, not really much to post right now.  Chris & I are going to apply for our passports today, I think.  We were supposed to go yesterday, but he had a meeting after work and I can't seem to find a passport office that stays open past 4 pm.  I'm going to have to take off a little early either today or tomorrow to get things done.  Swell.  On the up side, I'm seriously looking forward to Becca & Trevor coming up Friday!  I think I'm mainly ready to do a little bar hopping, but who really knows.  In an effort to help brighten your day,  urlLink click here  to read a blog by an intern having an affair with a Congressman.  I haven't gotten too into it yet, but I'm sure I'll have at least an hour on my hands today to explore a little.  And one more before I go:  urlLink 213 Things Skippy Is No Longer Allowed To Do In The US Army .  Enjoy my little ones, enjoy!

      Think you have a bad neighbor?   urlLink Check this out .  I just saw my neighbor a moment ago when I took the trash out.  She said that I'm always cleaning, but after see  urlLink that guy's apartment , I feel the need to go clean some more.  And I love rollercoasters just as much as the next person, but after  urlLink checking out this page , I'll think twice about wearing some itty bitty shorts on that next coaster.  I've seen plenty of cottonfields, beanfields and cornfields in my lifetime but never a  urlLink concrete cornfield .  Strangely serene.  This is a slightly different variation of the  urlLink McDonald's ebonics ad  that was sent around a few years back.  Nice and short so the guilt doesn't last too long.   urlLink Click here for some really cool street art .  OK, off to clean something.

      I will now be referring to Chris as Chris the Great.  Why?  Because his hands built the world, baby!  I came home at lunch today because I was so exhausted.  After eating some lunch, I took a 2 hour nap.  I NEVER take naps.  Ever.  So it was a little strange.  Maybe I'm coming down with something.  Oh well.  Your gain because I feel like doing a little link whorage today:   urlLink Can you imagine not know what sex is ?  Now try to imagine being married for 8 years and then going to a fertility clinic because they haven't been able to have a child.  Why, you ask?  Because they've never had sex and had no idea what it was.  Very, very strange - especially in this day and age!  This is one of the silliest inventions I think I've ever seen.   urlLink It's a foil sleeve for driver's who put one arm out of the window as they drive.   It kind of defeats the purpose.  Just what every new couple needs to compliment their bedroom -  urlLink a quilt made out of Crown Royal bags .  I think I'll skip this one, thanks.   urlLink Another strange website that follows your mouse .  Interesting, but not as fancy as some we've seen in the past.   urlLink Can you spot the differences ?  I must admit that I'm not the best at it, but it's still fun.   urlLink This is an interesting take on an online clock.  Kind of nice .  And finally, you can create your own  urlLink South Park character .  I had a chick with wings and claws.  Her name was Betty.

      I was so freaking stressed out today over finding Chris's state-certified birth certificate so that we could get our passports.  And in the back of my mind, I thought I would be OK and there wasn't really a reason to worry this much, but I couldn't stop myself from stressing out.  Anyway, long story short, I got home & found his birth certificate in the place I put all of my important papers.  Who would've thought to look in the very place it should have been in the first place?  Go figure.  I think I may get a chance to go see a Broadway show sometime soon.   A Boy From Oz  starring Hugh Jackman is on the top of the list, but all of this is tentative.  Some exciting news: my oldest sister, Bridget, who was just here visiting, will be graduating from LSU with her masters degree in Marketing.  Our family is going down to see her and everything.  I wish I were there!  So to Bridget:   CONGRATULATIONS!!  WE'RE PROUD OF YOU!

      Well, my sister came and went. She flew in Sunday evening and left this morning. I spent the last 2 nights with her at her hotel near Wall Street and it's kind of strange to stay in a hotel in the same town where you live. As a matter of fact, I haven't even been home since Sunday so I'm seriously looking forward to going home, putting on my pj's and sitting my ass in front of the computer to catch up on everything I've missed. However, I'm pretty sure there are still dishes left over from Sunday night's dinner waiting for me to wash. My work is never done.  Since I wasn't home Monday to blog, I need to get this off my chest:  HAPPY (belated) BIRTHDAY MOM!!  Monday was her 53rd birthday and she ended up working late. Just what she wanted, I'm sure. I did call her on her birthday, but I also like to announce this sort of thing to my entire of audience of 2 people, so there you go.  I can't help but comment on the  urlLink $1000 omelet . That's right, I said  urlLink $1000 OMELET . You can find this little treasure consisting of eggs, lobster, 10 ounces of caviar, and a few trimmings at Norma's restaurant in Le Parker Meridien hotel on West 57th Street. But if you'd rather just read all about it,  urlLink click here . I hear that only 1 person has ordered it so far: a British journalist. I wonder how that looks on his expense account. I'm sure it's a little more than what his daily allowance would cover.   urlLink This next article I found is fascinatingly odd . This guy slathered his entire hotel room - tv, bed, towels, doors, carpets, etc. - in about 14 jars of Vaseline. They found him at another hotel covered from head to toe in - you guessed it, Vaseline!! They also found pornographic materials in the trashcan in the first hotel room.  I found this on  urlLink Sheila O'Malley's  site and I think it's pretty funny considering I'm not a big Kerry fan.  urlLink It's a picture of his daughter in a completely see-thru dress - nipples, underwear and not much else.

      Have you ever had a time when your significant other treated you like a goddess (or god)?  Welcome to my Saturday night!!  Of course, I think it was because of my hair.  Let me explain: Yesterday, I had a hair appointment - touch up my highlights and a cut.  Well, the place I go to always straightens my hair before they cut it.  It's just something they do.  My hair is naturally wavy with a side of frizziness that Chris is always commenting on.  So when I emerge with straight-as-a-board blond hair, his heart went a flutter.  He treated me like a queen the rest of the day - not that he treats me like a slave girl any other time.  Of course, I may have to start straightening my hair more often.  I'll leave out all the details, but let's say no one had trouble falling asleep!  But to bring your mind out of the gutter for a moment, I'll tell you about our evening after we left the hair salon.  We walked from 32nd Street btw 5th Ave and Madison over to 40th Street and 7th Ave (I think) to go to Midtown Comics.  Low and behold who do we run into but Chris's sister, Cindy, and her boyfriend, John.  Hugs, hello's & comic book discussions ensued and then we all headed over to 9th Avenue for a food festival!!  Yum!!  They, of course, have every kind of food at these festivals and wouldn't you know it we found a place (The Delta Grill on 48th & 9th) that was selling boiled crawfish and crawfish ettoufee.  Yes, we got one of each and beer.  Unfortunately, the boiled crawfish were tiny and it was bland as all get out, but it was nice to be able to peel and suck a few on the streets of Manhattan.  After our mudbug orgy, Chris and I walked back to Times Square and headed home.  Great day!!  Now, for the exciting part of today:  BRIDGET IS ON HER WAY TO NYC!!!  Her first time to come visit and I'm meeting her at the airport at 4 pm.  I'm very excited!!  Unfortunately, I need to get off my ass and get busy cleaning this place.  Too much playing around yesterday leads to hurried cleaning today.  My apartment isn't too, too bad, but it's certainly not spotless.  Wish me luck!  Oh!  I went back to the Haloscan comments because I didn't want to loose what everyone has contributed, so comment away!!

      Chris & I watched Troy last night and let me just fill you in on something very special: there are 2 or 3 nude shots of Brad Pitt in this movie!!  Not full frontal nudity, but close enough to fill your dreams with men sweating and wearing teeny tiny leather skirts.  Yummy!!  It was a great movie & I have quite a few favorite parts, so get out there and see it!  P.S. Eric Bana & Orlando Bloom are fantasticaly yummy, too!  In sad news,  urlLink Becca's (becca.ooo-caliente.com)  cockateil died.  My condolences, Becca.  In the spirit of all that is bloginess, I stole this from  urlLink Cindi Rella !  It's a  urlLink fun golf game  you can play anywhere as long as you have a computer and a line to the internet.  Enjoy my little ones!  Today I'm going to get my hair cut and my highlights touched up.  I'll feel like a new woman when I'm done.  When I get home, I'll have to start the cleaning process since my sister, Bridget, will be here tomorrow afternoon!!  Since they changed her interview time, she comes in a day earlier and now we have 2 days/evening together to hang out.  I'll show as much as I can without overwhelming her.  I can't wait!  And then, my little sister, Becca, and her boyfriend, Trevor, will be here in like 2 weeks!!  They're staying for a whole week and while I'll have to work every day they're here, but they'll have plenty to keep them busy until I get off work.  OK, off to wake Chris up and then get ready to go into the city - cause I'm in Queens right now.  By the way, I'm working on changing the layout since Blogger is now offering many more interesting templates.  However, I've lost all of my comments.  Sorry.  Don't know if I'll get the ones back from Haloscan or not.  Leave a comment or email me if there is something missing that you'd like added back.

      Have you ever picked up a piece of clothing that you own that you haven't worn for while and you sit and wonder why you haven't worn it in so long? Well, that happened to me today. I was getting ready for work and picked out a black cap sleeved shirt that has a kind of mock wrap around neckline. It's black with red, pink and white flowers that ties in the back. So I decide to wear my little shirt to work and when I get there, it finally dawns on me why I don't wear the shirt to work anymore as I look down and see my right breast about to pop out of my shirt. Note to self: quit wearing the boob shirt to work!

      I don't know why, but I watched the video of the beheading of Nick Berg.  For one, I didn't think they would actually show the whole thing, but I was wrong.  I won't link to it but I will say that it's one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.  If you want to see it bad enough, then you, being the resourceful person that you are, will find it.  The sad part is that this was retaliation for the Iraqi prisoner abuse.  I could go into a whole rant about how wrong the abuse was and how these soldiers' superiors ordered them to pose and what not and how I feel about it.  I'm not jumping on that soapbox today.  I'm too disturbed by the video.  At the end of the video, they hold up his head in front of the camera just before it goes off.  Very disturbing.  Before I move onto lighter topics, let me first point out that I've been wondering if the media wouldn't highlight all of the bad things happening in the world, would we be happier people?  Would the ignorance of not knowing be worthwhile?  Would it give us a better quality of life?  I guess not.  Perhaps that was silly of me to think so.  Just because the media doesn't showcase something doesn't mean that it's not taking place.  So moving on to lighter, brighter things, can I just say that Brad Pitt is positively yummy?!?  With all of the hype for his next movie, Troy, coming out this Friday, there are pictures of him plastered all over this city.  And after about 2 years of absence, I say it's about time.  That's what my life has been missing: Brad Pitt all ripped up wearing a teeny tiny leather skirt.  I can now die a happy girl!  An update to what happened to my friend's son yesterday.  She got home and checked him out.  His neck hurt where one of the boys punched him and he had a headache that evening.  Turns out that there were 5 boys who tried to jump him and they all go to a charter school in the area where she lives.  Luckily, these boys were wearing their school uniforms and bandanas around their heads which made them easily to identify.  My friend went to their school this morning and spoke with the principal who offered to let her and her son come in after school and try to identify the boys by looking through the yearbook.  She plans on taking up her offer and once she identifies them, the school is going to contact their parents to make them aware.  She also made a report to the police but hasn't pressed charges.  She put it on record in the event they should try to pull something similar or worse and she'll call the police back with the boys' names once she has them.  I think she's probably done the smartest thing I could think of in this situation.  I would have never have thought to call the police or try to track these boys down by what uniforms they had on.  Note to future self.  I just got a call from my oldest sister, Bridget!  She is coming to NYC next week for an interview.  Unfortunately, she'll only be here overnight so I'm going to go spend the night with her in her hotel room.  I'm so excited that I get to see her, but sad it'll only be for 1 night.  Oh well, beggars can't be choosers, right?  I'll gladly take what I can get.  I'm going to try my hardest to show her as much as I can while she's here.

The Internet.  I can find anything my little heart desires in the blink of an eye.  8. My coffee maker.  It's programmable so all I have to do in the mornings is pour myself a cup.  7.

      It's such a beautiful day!!  And about damn time, too, considering it's May 11th!  Blogger has a new look and I think I like it.  Not so much happening in my world today.  Amanda came over last night and we started a lively game of Monopoly at about 9 pm that lasted for about 2 1/2 hours.  Amanda was kicking my ass & Chris's too!  She owned both utilities and all 4 railroads.  Chris was the first to erect a hotel and he would have bought more if it hadn't been so late.  I think I came out on the short end of the stick with fewer properties, but I did have Boardwalk and Park Avenue in my pocket!!  I've read so much these past few days about the Iraqi prison abuse and then I hopped over to  urlLink DaGoddess's  site.  I think she puts into words what I cannot, so please go and read.  It's a great post and if there's anything I could gank from her site today, it would be:  urlLink Apologies Do Not Weaken Us & Let's Move Forward .  And there's only one more thing I'd like to cover before I sign off today.  My friend (and co-worker) got a call from her oldest son, who is about 12 years old.  He was upset and crying.  She calmed him down and asked him what was wrong.  Turns out that some kids tried to jump him when he got off the bus at his block.  (The bus drops him off 1 block from his house)  This group of kids called out to him and he tried ignoring them.  Then one kid came at him and punched him in the neck.  Another kid was about to hit him when he took off running.  He ran home and called his mom.  She was upset - who wouldn't be - and left work early.  Her son did the right thing by getting out of the situation quick, but that leaves you to wonder what will happen tomorrow and the next day when he gets off the bus.  What about the day after that?  It's not like she can be there every day when the bus drops him off nor should she have to baby him.  After all, kids get into fights.  It's simply a part of growing up.  But when you and your kids live in Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, the Bronx, New Jersey, etc, you realize that things aren't like they were when you were growing up in a small town in the middle of BFE where people would actually stop and help someone in need.  Here, in this metropolis we call New York, people aren't as nice.  When someone is in need of help, most people here just walk on by and pretend they didn't see or hear a thing.  No one wants to be held responsible or worse yet, liable for something that might go wrong.  That's one of the scariest things about what happened to my friend's kid today.  If this group of kids really had tried to hurt her son, would anyone have stopped to help?  I'd like to think so, but I somehow doubt it.

      I found myself with time on my hands today so I was trying to think of some interesting topics for my post.  I've visited my usual news websites and found there's a lack of interesting things to post about that haven't already been beaten 12 feet into the ground.    So instead, I thought I would tell you what little I know about my stalker.  Let me first say that I don't for sure if he's stalking me, per say, but for all intents & purposes, he'll be my stalker today.  Nearly every morning when I leave for work, I get halfway down the block and I look up to find this guy standing on the corner.  He's always just waiting there.  Once he sees me, he starts walking very slowly to the subway.  Maybe I'm just a tool he uses to time the train, I don't really know.  Anyway, I see him & he starts walking to the train.  I pass him by and he doesn't say anything to me and he doesn't speed up his walking.  As a matter of fact, that's really about it except when it rains.  For some reason, he walks a little too close for comfort when I'm carrying my umbrella.  When it rains & I find him walking too close, it takes every little bit of self-restraint I have not to beat him down with my red Mandarin Oriental umbrella and then hop onto the train.  I don't necessarily feel threatened by my stalker, I'm just curious.  Why me and why does he just wait on the corner until he sees me coming.  Oh well, life's mysteries, I guess.  Needless to say, every time I see him, I'm left daydreaming about what exactly I would do to him if he should ever try to grab me.  And let me tell you, I'd sure make a hell of a racket & I'd go down kicking and screaming and biting and cussing to boot!  Well, that's enough stalker talk.  Today's Memes courtesy of  urlLink Monday Madness :  1. If you had a farm, what would you name the following animals:  pig, cow, goose, chicken, and horse (assume these are show animals and not food.)   pig : The Great Flying Bacon goose : The Mystical Magical Goose chicken : Wise Cock horse : The Stallion  2. What are the top ten spices you use in cooking and what is cooked with them as the main spice (ie. Oregano : spaghetti)   how about I just list the top 10 spices that I use to cook, huh?  Ok, they are: salt, pepper, Tony's Chachere Seasoning, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Salt, Lowry's Seasoning Salt, Garlic - ok, that's only 8, but I'm done.  3. Name your favorite flower and describe yourself using the letter.  This week, my favorite flower is the peony.   P is for purty E is for entertaining O is for outstanding N is for nice Y is for yippity-doo-da kind of day, don’t you think?  Ta-da!   urlLink That’s Monday Madness !

      It's such a beautiful day here in NYC!!  And about damn time, too!  Last night when we went to the movies, I finally got to wear my favorite sundress with a hoodie, of course.  I was so comfortable and it was so nice out that it almost felt magical.  Ah, summer!!  Yesterday at work, I came across this story on  urlLink Slate  about this woman who did an experimental silent treatment for just a couple of days and she tells about how hard it was to do it.  I thought it was pretty funny and it's a fast read, so check it out  urlLink here .  And now for your Saturday Links:   urlLink Can you catch a fly with chopsticks ?  It's kind of hard, but I caught at least one before I moved on, so here go -  urlLink your turn !  Why carry around some plain, boring black umbrella when you can carry around a  urlLink Bright Night Illuminated Umbrella ?!  According the article, it comes with 2 bulbs that actually do a great job of lighting up everything underneath the canopy, which you have the option of controlling with a button on the handle.  It has a battery compartment for 4 AA batteries that will give you 4 hours of lighting.  Cool colors, nice handle, great construction, & a light - would else could you possibly ask for?  OK, I know that's only 2 links, but I'll have to come back later.  It's such a nice day out that I can't just sit here in front of the computer anymore.  See ya later!

      Chris & I saw Van Helsing, after drinks & some appetizers.  I liked it for the special effects, but don’t expect great things from it.  The story line is a little weak.  I think the most awesome part was when these guys would turn into werewolves.  They would rip off their skin and their bones would start moving and shifting - it was really cool!  I also liked the vampire brides and how they would immediately change into these gorgeous women as soon as they touched the ground.  I'd recommend going to see it, but again, don't expect great things.   I haven’t bought my Mom a Mother’s Day gift yet but her birthday is the 17th, so I’m planning to send something halfway between for both events.  I know that’s kind of lame and lazy but that’s how things get done around my house.  Lame & Lazy.  If I had a ranch, I’d have to call it L & L Dude Rand and stock it with hot guys who walk around bare-chested all day long while they lift heavy things so that they sweat & then they’ll need me to rub their shoulders after their doneeeeee – sorry, I was drooling on my keyboard.  I’m going to have to come back to this subject after work!  My thoughts keep getting away from me and then I wake up only to have my coworkers staring at me strangely too afraid to ask questions.  Well, Chris is graduating from his Level 1 improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade.  His show is this Sunday at 4 pm.  I can’t wait to see my baby perform!!  I’m thinking about making a t-shirt with a picture of him on it and that says something stupid (read: embarrassing), but I’m going to have to think hard on this.  I may have to tap my sister, Bridget, for some ideas.  She’s a clever lass.   And for today’s random question:  What bones have you broken, if any?  And how did you break it?   Well, during the summer before 3rd grade, I was playing basketball on a concrete slab (that used to be our house before it burned) with 3 others.  I tripped and fell on my right arm.  It didn’t hurt until everyone started pointing at it & then it hurt like hell.  Long story short, I ended up in a full arm cast on my right arm.    A week after I finally got the cast off, I went over to my friend’s house to play.  We were climbing trees, doing cartwheels, running all over the place, etc.  Unfortunately, I tripped (again!) on my way into her playhouse & broke the same arm in the same place.  Luckily, since my Mom was still in the driveway talking to her Mom, she ushered me into the car wrapped my arm in ice and then we were on our way to Shreveport to get my arm set again.  And finally, in the 6th grade, I fractured my left arm during gym at school.  It was the first class of the day & we were playing dodgeball when, again, I tripped.  I made it through the day only to go home and beg my Dad to take me to the hospital cause it hurt so badly.  So there, that’s my 3 broken bones.  I won’t even get into the story of the 3 stitches I had in my head due to (once again) dodgeball.  Thought I was gonna say that I tripped again, didn’t ya?

      I found this little website, on  urlLink DaGoddess’s  website;  urlLink creative & funny story about moving to New York City through the eyes of a monkey .  I have a feeling our little friend, Pepe, will have similar experiences when he accompanies us to Italy, so be on the lookout for The Adventures of Pepe Vol. 1: Italy coming in August to a blog near you!  Neat website where people can  urlLink submit 5 things others don’t know about them .  Since I haven’t debuted there yet, here are some (not just 5) of mine:   Things I’m not afraid to admit, but probably should be:   I get to work an hour early so I’m not in bad mood due to overcrowded trains.  I’m usually pretty good about not eating sweets until right before my period at which point I will sit on the kitchen floor and eat left over chocolate icing right out of the can using my finger.  I still like to send handwritten letters to my family.  If I could, I would live in South Louisiana and I would be the happiest person in all the world.  My cat, Berg, thinks I’m his mistress and tries to make a move on me from time to time.  I have a heater underneath my desk that is always on as long as I’m at work.  And if I’m really cold, I also use my heating pad which can also be found under my desk.  In nearly 3 years, I’ve only been to one small part of Central Park several times.  I’ve only been to 1 major league baseball game – the Mets & they lost.  The very first concert I went to was either Bad Company when they came to NSU in Natchitoches or Clint Black in Shreveport.  I used to watch professional wrestling religiously.  I ordered the pay-per-views every month, but I have since stopped watching.  Part of me is disappointed and the other part is relieved.     And now, get ready for the Thursday Threesome :   Onesome : Something Old – Do you have anything that you’ve owned simply forever A cherished childhood toy, an antique handed down through the family . . . I have a wooden coffee table and an old metal kitchen table that was my (great)Grandmother’s.  They have traveled with me everywhere!   Twosome : Something New – Buy anything lately?  I bought lunch today, does that count?  Otherwise, the last thing I purchased that wasn’t food was a baby shower gift for someone I work with: diapers, wipes, baby spoons, medicine dropper, pacifiers, gas drops.   Threesome : Something Borrowed – Ever borrowed anything and never returned it?  I hate to admit it, but yes.  Some old tapes of ECW (wrestling) that someone loaned when I moved to NYC.   Bonus : Something Blue – See anything blue from where you are? What is it?  My shirt is blue, but other than that, my mousepad is also blue and the label on my water bottle and the cover of my notebook, the highlighter in my penholder, the top to my lotion bottle . . .   Play along!  When you’re ready, post your answer in your own space and  urlLink leave a comment here  so we can find you.

      I went to the Social Security Office yesterday expecting the worst.  How wrong I was!  And how happy I am to be wrong!  I'll have my new card in about 2 weeks.  Awesome!  There were no arguments on changing my name, no diagrams drawn, no accusations thrown in my direction.  Fabulous!  Two down, one to go.  Next comes passports.  Last night was the season finale for The OC.  I began watching The OC from the very first episode because there was absolutely nothing on TV on Tuesday nights since Buffy went off the air.  Yes, that's right, I was/am a Buffy fan.  I'm not a fanatic like some people I know, but a fan nonetheless.  I'm a little sad that The OC will now be reruns until Fall, but that's how the system works.  Tonight is the 2-hour season/series finale for Friends.  I'm sure I'll bawl my eyes out tonight.  I've already warned Chris and he's prepared to hand me tissues at will.  He's loves me so!  I am, of course, a little sad Friends is ending but it's been like 9 or 10 years and I think it's time.  I guess you can't keep the same gig forever.  So Monday evening, my (not-so-little) sister, Becca, went to my parents house looking for one of her rings.  No one was home at the time, so she looked around, used the bathroom & left.  Well, somehow, the toilet kept running and kept running and overflowed and ruined the carpet in my parent's bedroom, Becca's old bedroom and the hallway carpet.  Mom discovered this about 3 hours after Becca left the house.  They had to remove all of the furniture in both bedrooms, call the carpet people to come clean up as much water as possible, and then the insurance adjuster.  Once, they get everything squared away, they'll be laying down hardwood flooring throughout the house.  Unfortunately, it looks like they'll be spending Mother's Day weekend prepping the house by painting, etc.  Oh!  And it would seem when they pulled up the carpet, they found the ugliest brown tile flooring.  They had to remove that as well.  I feel so bad for them because they hadn't planned on doing all of this work just yet, but they were planning on redoing the flooring at some point.  Perhaps this will jump start the remodeling of their house.  I wish I were there helping them out.  I love that sort of thing.  Well, I need to go blow dry my hair & get ready for work.  I don't wake up looking stunning, you know.  My tiara is usually crooked in the mornings when I wake up.  Time to go fix that.

      I am now official.  I have a New York State driver's license - or a temporary license, anyway.  I'll get the new one in the mail in the next 3 or 4 weeks.  It was not without conflict, which was to be expected.  I got up to the first counter & everything was OK.  I took my picture, she gave me my number and papers & told me to go sit until my number flashed on the board.  I did as I was told and my number was finally on the board.  So it was up to counter #9, I handed him my paperwork and waited.  First, he didn't want to accept my marriage certificate because he didn't think it was the official one from the state.  I argued my case and he finally asked his manager who said she would accept my certificate.  Yee haw!!  Then of course, he argued with me on how I'd decided to change my name.  Technically, when you get married and you're changing to your married name, you should simply switch out the 2 last names.  However, my Mom & my sister both did it differently.  (First Name, Maiden Name, Married Name)  I choose to do it differently as well.  This obviously angered the little man behind the counter who proceeded to argue his point which included 2 different drawings so that he could stress his point even further.  He went so far as to tell me that I was in the 10% who was in the wrong & I was setting a bad example for my future (nonexistent) children.  I stand there trying to keep my cool, everything going slightly red.  Obviously, I could have decided to change my name to Lulu Tutu if I felt like it & there really isn't anything anyone could do about it.  I don't know why this guy felt so compelled to argue with me, but he let me change my name how I wanted.  I was proud that I kept my cool - only because I was afraid he'd throw me out and make me come back another day.  This was my 3rd attempt after all.  So today, I'm off to the Social Security Office here in Queens.  I'll let you know how that turns out.  I'm actually quite afraid that it's going to turn into one huge disaster, but we'll have to wait and see.  I guess I'm up for making multiple trips to the Social Security Office if I have to.  I did for the DMV.  After getting my new social security card, I will attempt to get a passport.  I've got fun written all over me the next few weeks.  All of this so we can go on our trip to Italy at the end of July.  Now I have to go get ready to go.  It's May 5th - Cinco de Mayo!  Unfortunately, it's only 49 degrees outside and the high for today is only 61.  Come on summer!!

      Some Mondays are just fine & dandy - no big deal.  Today, I thought my head would explode.  First, I went down the DMV (that says it all right there, doesn't it?) to get my Louisiana license changed to a NY State license & also to change my maiden name to my married name.  Yes, nearly 2 years after the fact.  You don't have to remind me.  It's not like I haven't tried to do this before, but they didn't accept my marriage certificate last time because it wasn't  the certified copy.  Anyway, so after asking my sisters to go by the courthouse & picking up the correct copy, I sat on it for about a year.  So that brings us back to today. I'm in line at 8 am.  The office opens at 8:30 & the line is halfway around the corner & down the block.  Once I finally make it to the window, they tell me they need my birth certificate which I have conveniently left at home.  I silently collect my papers, etc. and head to work.    Once I hit work, I'm told that the 22 books we sent out on Friday (and that I stayed an hour & a half late to complete) had to be redone since there weren't any page numbers and there was 1 spelling error.  I just bit my tongue, hole-punched the 22 books, spiral bound them, boxed them up and sent them out.  Silently cursing everyone.

      I had somewhat of a strange day today.  At 1 pm I went to a baby shower that was on my street, but 4 1/2 blocks down.  I work with the mother-to-be.  So I go to their apartment (which is huge!) & there are family members there from both sides.  And they were all great!  Very nice, but I couldn't help but compare this shower to the baby showers that I'm used to going to back home.  Let me start by saying I have a HUGE family on both sides of my family.  My Mom's family all live within about an hour's drive, but most are about 20 minutes away.  When we get together, it's 90% family & there are like 30+ people there with kids running everywhere.  And you get EVERYTHING!  This was the group that we mainly did this sort of activity with since they were all so close.  I think in today's experience, I was that other 10% in the "friends" category that goes to showers.  There were about 20 people there including me.  Actually, I think I was the only one there who wasn't family, but it didn't take me long to strike up a conversation with Pam.  Pam's mother was married to the mother-to-be's grandfather.  After much thought, I finally figured out all of the connections.  Anyway, Pam is married and lives in Greenwich Village.  She is an artist & photographer.  Her husband is a writer, I think, at Sports Illustrated - which just happens to be across the street from where I work.  His office is on the 2nd floor above one of the letters.  Anyway, she was telling me how they just went to Greece so that he could do a story on the upcoming Olympics.  She went with him and took like 1000 photos.  However, they just got back from New Zealand just a few days prior (to the shower).  She couldn't stress enough how great New Zealand was to visit.  Little does she know that she doesn't have to convince me too hard since Chris & I are dying to go to New Zealand on our next trip.  During her trip, they went bungee jumping.  She's in her mid-40s and she doesn't look like the adventurous type, which gives me hope that I won't chicken out of bungee jumping one day when I get my opportunity.  After leaving the shower around 4:30 pm, going home & changing clothes and going to the grocery story, I did laundry.  Such a tiring chore.  I'm glad it's over.  Until next week that is.  Oh!  Back home at the grocery stores, I don't remember ever seeing packages of chicken feet or cow tongues among other strange items I find up here.  Odd thing is, I can't even find blocks of Velveeta Cheese at this store.  They have most of the basics, but I also have a hard time finding Lemon Pepper seasoning there as well.  Ok, enough of that.  So Chris & I are trying to learn some Italian before our trip at the end of June.  I have some words down, like: thank you(grazie), you're welcome (prego), excuse me as in sorry (scuzi) - and I think that's it.  It's a start, but I really need to buckle down and work on it.  I'd like to be able to understand certain words so that our trip will be even more AWESOME!  Ok, so I guess I'm going to go learn some Italian now.

      On the subject of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by 6 US troops, may I just say that it's appalling?  I'm somewhat outraged by this.  We wouldn't want US citizens in prison elsewhere in the world to be treated in this manner.  They did it for shits & giggles and I hope they get what they deserve.  They now say that the soldiers who did this didn't know the Geneva Convention rules.  Seems like someone should have filled them in considering they were responsible for Iraqi prisoners of war in a war zone.   urlLink But moving on to other things, I read this story about a woman who drove around with her mother's decomposing body in the passenger seat of her for like 5 days.  They were from Oklahoma and they finally stopped the daughter in Florida.  Authorities say she died from natural causes so no charges will be filed, however, the daughter is now being held for psychiatric evaluation.   WEED MARCH - Yesterday, I read the following in the AM-NY newspaper.  I didn't even know such a thing exists & I'm surprised they can do this but since they're simply meeting and not smoking, it's OK.  You would never hear of something like this in the small town where I grew up - only in NYC.  Anyway, the article goes:   Million Marijuana March set for Sat.  - Potheads from all around town are expected to converge on Lower Manhattan tomorrow for the New York City Million Marijuana March.   Organized by a coalition of marijuana legalization advocates, protesters will march from Greenwich Village to Battery Park.  A variety of issues will be raised, from the Rockefeller drugs laws to medicinal marijuana.  The weed walkers will assemble at noon at Houston Street and Broadway and start marching at 1 p.m.  Police said they will treat tomorrow's march like every other large gathering.

You're such a link whore:   urlLink Here's a neat site of a little boy who has had his picture taken with a few celebrities here in NYC.  Cool site!   And where would we be without  urlLink a little fun in the library during finals week .  I'm sure this helped de-stress a lot of people.  It takes a little while to load, but it took them a little while to come up with their routine, I'm sure.  It would seem that someone's imagine has gotten away from them, but that's what interests us the most, right?  Everyone like to see what twisted things we come up with when we have time on our hands & this is no different because it's  urlLink The Truth About Cereal Characters by Bobber .

      Not much time to post today since Chris-the-Great & I are about to go watch Spider Man 2!!  I wasn't a big fan of the first movie, but I hear this one is much better, so I hope they're right!  I just wanted to do a little promoting:   urlLink Operation Shoe Fly  is an organization "formed in an effort to help with the collection, consolidation, and delivery of humanitarian aid for the Afghani people."  (Yep, I stole that right off their website.)  They're not only asking for shoes, but for other objects to send to Afghanistan, so please check it out and help if you can.  There are 3 options:  Option 1: Mail directly to Operation Shoe Fly-  Operation Shoe Fly c/o Jim Thomson B Co, 214th Aviation Regiment APO AE 09354  Option 2: Mail to Angels for Afghanistan who will ship pallets to the Stan-  Globous Relief Fund (OPSF) c/o Angels for Afghanistan 1775 West 1500 South Salt Lake City, Utah 84104  Option 3: Mail to Chief Wiggles who will add to his shipments to the Stan-  Bridgepoint Systems (OPSF) c/o Operation Give 542 West Confluence Avenue Salt Lake City, Utah 84123  Alright, must go get ready for Spidey, but before I go,  urlLink click here  for the next installment of: What the F*ck Where They Thinking?!?

      Brad & Beth are now safely back on Louisiana soil and I'm sure Brad is driving his truck doing some "country riding."  Don't ask.  Anyway, we had a great time with them!  I'll be posting some pictures in the Gallery 6 link on the right in a couple of days.  As of this post, I only have 3 up.  I hope they come back for another visit so we can do everything we missed.  In other news, I've started reading The Da Vinci Code.  I'm only on Chapter 4, but it's good so far.  Also, the Discovery Channel was filming an episode  urlLink Surprise By Design  in a building across the street & down from our apt.  I must go wake Chris-the-Great from his nap & heat up some leftover spaghetti for dinner.  I don't think I need to cook at all this week since I have leftovers spilling forth every time I open the refrigerator door.

      I am so exhausted!  It's been a busy week for me and I'm glad we can sleep in tomorrow.  Well, actually, Chris-the-Great has to get up early (8:45 am) for a class rehearsal.  Brad, Beth & I are going to the Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero, the Merril Lynch bull near Wall Street.  From there, we'll just play it by ear as they say.  We have to go back down to Chinatown at some point and we also still would like to go to the Empire State Building before sunset.  We've had a good time so far, but my poor knee hurts.  After walking Chinatown, SoHo up the to East Village (4th Street around Astor Place).  Oh!  And we also went to see Dodgeball with Ben Stiller & Vince Vaughn.  Absolutely hilarious!!  It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time - like consistently through nearly the entire movie!  I don't know if it's just because we used to play dodgeball in school & it could be quite vicious sometimes.  I think I've already posted about how I received 3 stitches & broke my arm in my dodgeball days.  I'd look for it, but I'm feeling pretty lazy tonight, uh, I mean this morning.  Anyway, hilarious movie!  Go see it, you won't be disappointed.  I've really got to get to bed now.  My eyes are starting to close.  Tomorrow, the adventure continues.

      Well Brad & Beth made it here just fine & since they've arrived, we had lunch at Uno Pizzeria here in Astoria & then we walked around a small part of Central Park until Chris got off work.  We also walked around some of the shoppes at the new Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.  We're home for now.  Chris has class tonight and I think I'm going to take them to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral tonight.  Chris will get out of class at 10 pm and I don't know if they're up for going out later.  I'll probably be too tired to go.  I have the hardest time staying up late during the week.  So far, I think it's a lot busier than they thought it would be and maybe a little cleaner, too.  Chris & Brad are up on the roof and Beth is catching a quick nap while I blog my little heart out.  I just posted a picture of Radio City Music Hall from the night of the PRIMUS concert.  Enjoy.  If you look close enough, you'll see the name of the tour on the marquee.  Gotta go entertain.

       urlLink Primus  was awesome!   urlLink The Hallucino Genetics Tour !  It started at exactly 8 pm and ended at 10:57 pm.  They said something about having to be out of the building at 11 pm.  There was no pig, but the drum solo knocked my knockers off!  The concert was at Radio City Music Hall & I had never been there before.  It was like stepping back into the 30's with all of the grandeur of gentlemen & ladies - the building, not the crowd of concertgoers.  The bathrooms alone were divine!  The seats were velvet with carpet everywhere - in the seating area, not the bathrooms.  There were ushers everywhere and I even got patted down as we entered Radio City.  And even though they announced before the concert that there was no smoking, that didn't stop people from lighting up.  And we're not talking cigarettes here.  The ushers didn't stop anyone & no trouble, of course.  Most potheads are fairly harmless especially when there's live music 75 feet in front of you from the most awesome band in the world.  Unfortunately, getting myself going this morning proved to be difficult.  After I got up and got my shower & Chris-the-Great was out the door, I took an hour nap.  I don't think it did much good.  My eyes wouldn't even open until Noon today.  I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep standing up.  Still worth it.  Brad & Beth are coming tomorrow!  Chris-the-Great has class tomorrow night, but I'm sure we'll find something to do while he's gone.  I of course still need to finish cleaning the apt.  I'll probably finish up tomorrow morning.  On the other hand, I'm taking the bus to the airport tomorrow.  I haven't done that in a while and I'm kind of looking forward to it.  Buses really arent' my thing.  I just can't seem to get the bus schedules down so I never take them unless I absolutely have to.  I don't mind walking.  Ok, off to go clean something.  But before I go, I checked out  urlLink Lisa  at  urlLink Just A Girl In The World  and found it to be worthy of the link button.  Go check her out!  Now!  And while I'm plugging, go also check out  urlLink Becca !  Shoo!  Now go!

      Another Monday off to a fine start.  I could have killed Chris-the-not-so-Great this morning.  Sergio came downstairs last night & cut his hair around 11:30 or midnight.  Chris took a shower afterward, but didn't bother writing me a note or resetting his alarm clock.  I've been awake since about 4:50 am - in 10 minute intervals.  He didn't tell me until nearly 5:30 am that he had already taken his shower so he could sleep for a while.  All that time - wasted - not sleeping.  But the upside to all of this is: I'm going to see PRIMUS tomorrow!!  Yeah, that's right bitches!  So don't expect a post tomorrow, I'll be partying away!  This week will be busy: Brad & his friend, Beth are coming for a visit on Thursday.  I don't know Beth but I guess I'll have time to get to know her.  Then, in late August, my sister Catherine & her husband, John, are coming up for her birthday!  I just found out today so I'm way excited!  But, let's not forget Italy.  I mean, it's only the first real vacation Chris & I have ever taken together in the 9+ years we've known each other.  Oh, and our first trip overseas ever - for both of us.  Yeah!!  The only thing we have left to do is get our passports.  If for some reason our waiting this long to get our passports screws up our trip, I'm going to flip my lid!  I've got to think positively.  Think positively . . .  In today's news: In pursuit of the $10 million X-prize, the first privately built aircraft made it 62.5 miles upward into space, briefly. It then returned to where it took off just a short time afterward. This is the first step in competing for the prize; the contest will happen later this year. ( urlLink CNN.com )  From News of the Weird: From a police report quoted in Seattle's newsweekly The Stranger (April 29): "[A] witness stated that he and another witness watched the suspect walk up to several different men [at the University Book Store on the University of Washington campus], get on his knees, and sniff their anuses. He would then lean forward as though he was getting a book off the lower shelf. [One witness] also said that when one male got up from a bench and walked away, the suspect walked over and started smelling the area where the male had been sitting. When the witnesses confronted the suspect about the incidents, the suspect said, 'Sometimes I forget myself and get carried away.'"  I'm hearing so much about that fat f*ck Michael Moore - that hypocritical piece of sh*t.  Anyway, his movie is coming out this weekend or next and there's a lot of hype about it and I'm trying to decide if I'm going to go see it.  I mean, on the one hand, I don't like the man.  He's a big hypocrite.  On the other hand, I'm curious to see what kind of lies this man has on tape.  I'm also curious to see what kind of footage this guy has from the Middle East.  For instance, as we all know by now, he had footage from one of the hostages but didn't want to release it since he thought it would generate negative publicity for his movie.  That selfish piece of sh*t.  Alright, so I'm going to see the movie but I won't be happy about paying for it.  I hate thinking he's actually making money off of this.  Why do I hate this man so much?  Oh, yeah, he's a big fat hypocritical piece of sh*t, that's why.  I need to go have a beer and calm down.  That fat f*ck.

      I love Fridays because it's the start of the weekend, which means I can sleep in tomorrow!!  Yeah!  Chris & I went over to Cindy's apt. earlier to set up her new computer.  It was shipped to our apt. so we had to bring it over.  Damn that thing was heavy.  The monitor came double boxed, so we had to leave the smaller box at our apt. so we could fit it all in the cab.  She should get hooked up to the internet next week & then the fun will begin for her.  We just watched Duplex on Movies-on-Demand tonight.  Ben Stiller.  Drew Barrymore.  It was kind of funny at times but the ending kind of sucked.  Killed what little the movie offered.  Here's a  urlLink link to a mysterious little clip .  It takes a while to load & I don't have any information on it really.  It's obviously a shootout in what appears to be somewhere in the Middle East.  Scary when you stop and think about it.   urlLink This should be illegal  - I mean, there should be a limit on the breast implant size based on your body type/frame and just plain common sense.  Next up is a collection of  urlLink strange band names .  OK, last one for the night:  urlLink Which Muppet Are You ?   urlLink I am Gonzo .

      I should have just stayed in bed this morning.  First, I have a hard time getting Chris up, thus he stalked off to the shower in quite the mood. Then, I couldn't get the mouse to work on the desktop computer this morning so I could check the weather. After 2 attempts, I used the laptop. Later, my train was held up at the last stop in Queens before going into the City due to a stalled train at the next station. I transferred to the 7 train and walked from Times Square to Rockefeller Center. It wasn't a bad walk, just 10 blocks. The thing that set me off was having to walk on sidewalks that had just been washed. Doesn't sound bad, does it? Well, I was wearing flip flops and the back of my pink skirt had little black dots all over it. Unfortunately, I didn't notice it until after I'd waited in line at the bank's ATM for 15 minutes trying to make a deposit. Luckily, that part went right - so far anyway. So I finally rolled into work 40 minutes after my normal time. Unfortunately, I couldn't do anything about my skirt. To top that off, what's waiting for me when I get home: dishes & laundry. I should have just stayed in bed.  I called my little sister earlier to rub in the fact that: I'M GOING TO SEE PRIMUS! Amanda and I are going this Tuesday night.  Something I find strange: you know those plush dolls from Hallmark that dance and sing when you push a button? I seriously can't stand those things! I go to Hallmark today and find one of my coworkers pressing all the buttons and laughing up a storm. It took all that I had to not drag her away from the table and give her a good kick. Those things are just so annoying, so PLEASE, don't anyone ever buy me one of those things! I'll probably just burn it.

      It's been another lovely day in the neighborhood, so far anyway. Today at lunch, I went to a Japanese bookstore/gift shop in Rockefeller Center with a friend. She's half Japanese & her American father teaches Japanese at a school in Florida. So for Father's Day - which is this Sunday - she got him a few things for his desk at the school. The store was really cool, but I didn't know what half the stuff was since neither of us speak Japanese nor read it for that matter. If we couldn't figure out what it was by looking at it and turning it over and over in our hands, then back on the shelf it went!  Chris the Great checked in Jessica Simpson & her sister, Ashley, today at work. He said that Jessica is a stuck-up snob but everyone else was really nice. Which brings me to my next announcement: The season premiere of SIMPLE LIFE 2 will air tonight on FOX at 8 pm EST. I must admit that I watched it last season simply to see how they fared in the middle of nowhere, but I'm afraid this season will be too commercialized after the success of last season. I guess I'll have to wait & see!  In other TV show news, Chris & I have been watching HBO's Deadwood. The first season just ended and it was way better than I thought it would be. I'm afraid I'm hooked and now I'm upset that I have to wait until this fall to see a new episode. But have no fear - I will not have to go that long before seeing a (repeat) episode. We subscribed to HBO & Cinemax-on-Demand and we can now watch any show on those stations that has already run this season. I can go back and watch all episodes of Deadwood back-to-back if I feel like it or I can watch soft porn until my heart's content, which is what we did last night!  Our company's Summer Outing is coming up the 2nd Monday in August. Every year, they rent out the country club & people have the following options: golf, tennis, swimming, softball, volleyball, or just laying out by the pool. And then there's the open bar for the entire day! Here's a general rundown of how the day goes:       catch the bus from the office at 10 am     get to the club around 11:30 am     eat brunch & drink mimosas     activity (or inactivity) of your choice     freshen up at around 5 pm     cocktail hour at 5:30 pm     dinner is served around 6 or 6:30 pm     catch the bus back to the city around 7:30 pm  All in all, I think it's a lot of fun. Unfortunately, last year it rained most of the day & people were kind of stuck inside. This year, the Summer Outing will be my first day back in the office after our trip to Italy. Nothing like a nice day of lounging around and drinking to get you back in the grind.

      I went to see  urlLink The Boy From Oz  last night and it was by far one of the most fantastic things I've ever seen!  It was my first Broadway Show and I hope it won't be my last.  Hugh Jackman starred in the show & he was so witty & energetic that it blew my mind.  And he got undressed/dressed on stage a couple of times, which is always nice!  Not much else to report.  I'm exhausted so I can hopefully veg-out tonight and get to bed a little early.  There's a lot of talk about who John Kerry will choose for his VP.  I think  urlLink Blackjack  breaks it down best, so go take a look at his post.  Since I won't be voting for Kerry, I don't care that much who he chooses.  It will be interesting when the debates start later this year, so Kerry will have to pick someone who can debate Dick Cheney.  It should be another interesting election year!  Well, I guess I should go get ready for work.  Time to go pay the piper.

      Well, the desktop is finally up and running.  Turns out that we had to disconnect the hard drive we installed a few months ago and rerun the recovery disks.  Alls well that ends well as they say.  I was perusing  urlLink Natalie 's post over on  urlLink Pickle Juice: Raged and Obuse  where she talks about her amazing ability to flirt.  Oddly enough, this reminds me of a dream I had the other night where Chris was sitting on the living room floor with the girl and he was flirting right in front of me.  He then leaned in and gave her a kiss, pulled back, and then went for a 2nd kiss.  Boy was I mad when I woke up!  And when he woke up, I let him know I didn't appreciate his cheating on me right in front of me.  Very strange dream.  Very.  OK, time to trade computers with Chris.

      This is my first post from my new laptop computer.  It's a nice little Toshiba Satellite and I like it!  We're bringing this laptop to Italy so that we can download our pictures from our digital camera so we can take even more pictures of Italy.  When Becca & Trevor were here, we took 750 pictures and each one was 6.2 megapixels which equals a lot of memory.  Ta da!  Laptop.  At the same time, we're trying to fix the desktop which was running slow.  We decided to simply start over from scratch.  It unfortunately didn't work so smoothly but the lady on HP's technical support line said that I need to disconnect everything except the monitor, mouse & keyboard and try again.  After that, they'll charge me $40 to work on it since it is no longer under warranty.  On the bright side of things, my cousin Rachel will be coming to NYC for a visit in July with a couple of her girlfriends.  They're staying at a hotel not far from where I work, so I should be able to spend some quality time with her.  She's just a year younger than I am and grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.  Her dad and my dad are 1st cousins.  I haven't seen here in about 5 years or so - maybe 6.  Anyway, I'm really looking forward for her visit.  Also, later this month, Chris's friend, Brad, is coming for a week with a friend of his.  Chris says he sounds excited about coming and we're excited he's coming, so that makes a good match!  Well, I just inserted the final disk of 7 disks which will take in total 33 minutes to run - I would know since this is the 3rd or 4th time I've done this tonight.  Wish me luck!

      Friday night, Chris & I watched The Chronicles of Riddick & I loved it.  Of course, I also liked the first movie, Pitch Black.  I think this one was even better than the first.  Saturday, Chris & I had a very lazy day.  We didn't even get dressed until Cindy & Jackson came.    We kept Jackson last night and we've just had biscuits with syrup.  Jackson's now watching the Osmosis Jones cartoon.  I'm supposed to go to Central Park with Amanda later & I'm really looking forward to getting outside on this beautiful weekend.  Ok, I've got to get a shower and wash this funk off me.  Today, from  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings  I say ... and you think ... ?    1. Colorblind : my Dad  2. Shallow : ditch  3.

      I had such a problem getting onlne tonight!  Turns out that our internet connection wasn't automatically connecting, like it normally does.  Regardless, I am watching the MTV Movie Awards.  And it is absolutely hilarious so far!  Tom Cruise is yum-scrum-di-li-umptuous!!  Chris is at his third Level 2 Class at UCB.  I think he's having a good time so far, but each level gets harder and more intense and I think he sees that right now.  I posted a picture of Berg, but I don't think you can really see how big he is.  He weighs about 15 lbs. and he's very protective of the hallway and doesn't like the men who deliver the weekly box of groceries.  Or the buzzer.  And sometimes the phone.  More sad news:  urlLink Ray Charles died today around 11:35 am at the age of 73 from complications of liver disease .  It's sad to lose both Reagan and Ray Charles within a week's time of each other.  As  urlLink Becca  pointed out, these things usually happen in 3's . . .

      Wow Faye!  I can never space my clothes out like that; I don't have enough!  For all of you fans out there, Faye is a guest blogger on this site.  She's funny, she's brilliant, she's Southern, she's a badass.  Welcome Faye!!  In the spirit of Anne of  urlLink In A Puddle , I will posting a picture of Berg in all his glory.  Coming soon!  There's not much going on right now.  I'm watching President Regan's funeral procession from the plane to the Rotunda where his body will lie for visitation by the public.  This all makes me very sad.  But let me just say that I have such tremendous respect for Nancy Reagan.  She's so graceful.  I've been to more funerals than I can count & while I'm sad Mr. Reagan is now gone (he was one of my favorites), this whole thing makes me think of all of the family & friends I've lost over the years.  I miss them.  But onto happier things: last night, I made  urlLink Thai Peanut Chicken .  I got the recipe from  urlLink KraftFoods.com  and it was absolutely fantastic!  We're having leftovers tonight.

      I'd just like to say that Dennis has good observations....  I've only worn this shirt a few times to work. I think it was once when I had an interview to go to and once when I had a date for lunch. And then today. But I'm only wearing it cause I couldn't find anything to wear that wasn't dirty or a t-shirt.  So, I'm in the back getting a cup pf coffee when Dennis comes up and says, "No clean clothes? You got an interview or a lunch date?" I was like, "Yea! No clean clothes!!! How did you know?" He then informed me that I've only worn this shirt a few times and they were all special occasions.   I so need to go shopping.

      Something that irks the living daylights out of me: coworkers who walk right past me in the morning that don’t say hello or good morning.  They literally won’t talk unless someone else initiates the conversation.  And I just absolutely refuse to do it anymore.  I know that sounds silly and childish but I don’t care.  It’s not like we don’t all talk to each other all the livelong day.  We work in the same area.  We have to look at each other all day long.  Why do they have their noses stuck in the air with their ears shut?  That’s what I miss most about the South; the hospitality and friendliness.  Oh well.  I could complain about that until the cows came home but that won’t get me anywhere.  So, onto bigger and better things.  Chris & I are enjoying our new 6.3 megapixel digital camera.  I’ll be posting some pictures now that I’ve figured out how to do that, but since the pictures are rather large in size, I will be posting pictures from Becca & Trevor’s trip on a separate webpage.  I’ll add the link to the right when I’ve completed it.  I also have new pictures of my nephews that I’ll be posting soon, though the boys are naked in nearly all of the pictures.  What can I say?  We’re Southern & don’t believe in clothes sometimes.  I don’t think there are any shots of any winkies, so I don’t expect child porn charges to be filed anytime soon.  One of the ladies in our office has just walked past handing out copies of the latest sample sales.  A sample sale is a hugely discounted sale of designer brands; anything from Vera Wang to Chanel to Armani to Gucci to Kate Spade to Sean Jean and on and on and on.  While normal prices are slashed up to 90%, everything is still somewhat expensive – especially considering my paycheck.

      In sad news, former President Ronald Reagan has passed away at the age of 93.  According to  urlLink CNN.com :  His office said he died of pneumonia, described as a complication of Alzheimer's disease, a condition he made public in a stirring letter in 1994.   In disturbing news, someone has allowed  urlLink J Lo to marry again .  This time to singer Marc Anthony.  Let's see if this one will last the year mark.  I somehow doubt it, but they could surprise me.  In an effort to do my part, I've joined  urlLink Spirit of America .  If they should need me to, I'll volunteer my time and/or skills - what little I have - to help send aid to those who need it in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I've seen various references to  urlLink Spirit of America  all over the internet & I've always been a late bloomer, so go check it out & volunteer if you can.  They need all the help they can get and they've already done some good in these war-torn countries.  Now, I've taken that first step.  Go take yours.  And while I'm at it, I'm also going to plug  urlLink  Voices of Valor: D-Day: June 6, 1944   written by Douglas Brinkley and Ronald Drez, with help from our very own Anne of  urlLink In A Puddle  who worked on the 2 CDs that come with the book.  Go and check it out.  So far, I've only read what's on the page that is  urlLink linked here  & I'm intrigued.  I plan on picking up the book.  In another piece of sad news, Becca & Trevor left this morning.  I'm sad & I cried on the walk back from putting them in a cab.  I miss them already.  I'll be putting up pictures from their trip in the next few days.  If I can figure out how to add pictures to my blog, then I'll add a couple here and there.  I'll let you know when I have pictures from their trip up.  Yesterday, we went exploring in Central Park.  Neither Chris nor I had ever been that deep into the park we discovered a lot of hidden areas - rape stations as we like to call them.  Needless to say, we promised each other to never venture that far in without someone with us.  There are some really secluded areas with waterfalls & bridges and such.  Pretty cool.  Finally, for this week's  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings :  I say ... and you think ... ?   1.  Charity : give money 2.  Scale : cliffs 3.  Jennifer Lopez : married again?!? 4.  Coercion : terrorism 5.  Meter : measurement 6.  Pressure : earthquake 7.  June : summer 8.  Infestation : summer bugs 9.  Serial killer : The Frighteners (which I watched the other day) 10. Anguish : torment

      So this past week's blogging has been a little sporadic, but next week will be back to normal.  I'm a little sad today since Becca & Trevor will be leaving in the morning.  I'll probably cry like I always do.  I think they're going to stay up all night tonight since they have to leave the apt. at 4 am.  I plan on staying up with them.  I tried staying up last night, but crashed around midnight.  I woke up at 5 this morning to find Chris the Great asleep next to me, with his bedside lamp and the TV on.  But, since you've been lacking, here, ladies & gentlemen, are your  WEEKEND LINKS :  It's about time you've met  urlLink TRAVIS !  Yes, he's the next internet superstar!  And then there's  urlLink ghetto furniture at its best !  If this shows up in my house or the house of anyone I know, I will personally destroy it.  Want to see a picture of  urlLink John Ashcroft made entirely out of pictures of porn ?  Of course you do!   urlLink Just click here .  I don't know about you, but I prefer to have no party favors than  urlLink this !  I would say this is a  urlLink bizarre series of art , but I'm sure someone's loving it.  While I like the style, I just don't think this happens very often.  If so, someone needs new undershorts.  I'm sure some people get off on  urlLink this sort of thing , I just hope I'm never invited over to their house.  You sick, sick f*cks.  This is a  urlLink badass webpage  if ever I saw one.  Watch his eyes when you move around the page.  And finally, here are the  urlLink dirty 2nd cousins of the Care Bears .

      Ok, so I thinks it's obvious - to the world - that we got a little drunk the other night for Becca's 21st birthday.  May I just say that Marines & Fleet Week are now my favorite holiday!  So now Becca & Trevor are somewhere in Chinatown hagling for sunglasses & watches.  I'm so proud!  Unfortunately, I now have to pull myself out of this chair & go in there and do the dishes before I start dinner.  Never stops.  And today's winner of the Yayaempress: What the Fuck Award is:  urlLink Man Commits Suicide After Sex With Hen .  Dude, what the fuck?!?

       YA YA REVOLUTION    Today, our revealing expose on  Ya Ya Empress  continues.   A post from  Friday, October 3, 2003  provides our first definitive proof of her trusty sidekick, sweetly referred to as  Becca .&nbsp; However, she is also known as  Becca The Bruiser  on the undercover circuit.&nbsp; Ashcroft has photographs, magnificently captured in black and white I might add, of BTB holding Mormon missionaries' bicycles over a trash compactor until they agreed to do her evil bidding.&nbsp; The Bruiser has also been known to discreetly do away with top level officials by slipping them genetically altered  Dr. Peppers  with the  fizz of death .&nbsp;   In other news on this day, Ya Ya, sends a secret message out to her supporters for a secret project thinly veiled as televised wrestling.&nbsp; In reality, Ya Ya has masterminded a plan to harvest the transients looked down upon by society into an indestructible army of darkness.&nbsp; Yes, the code name  Smackdown  can mean only one thing - a finely tuned crack whore martial arts squadron.&nbsp; It is a straight man's best fantasy and worst nightmare as he watches them pull those Chinese stars off their nipples and plant them firmly in his chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I  shudder  even now as I think about it.   On  Tuesday, October 6, 2003 , Ya Ya has decided to make her him-bot, formerly known as Chris the Great, into the general of her  Crack Whore Debutantes of Death (CWDOD) &nbsp;by dressing him up as a, and I quote, "transvestite Viking."&nbsp; The CWDOD is on constant standby, ready to respond with one subtle movement of the horn on his helmet, his long blonde pigtails flowing out behind him like a Nazi propaganda film that can only be achieved by a well placed stage fan.&nbsp; (Thank Becca the Bruiser for that one, disguised as a hotel maid with a peg leg and monocle.)    Thursday, October 9, 2003 , shows that Ya Ya has planted her him-bot undercover at the  Mandarin Oriental New York Hotel at Columbus Circle , which is a sinister match with his fatal, chopstick-wielding skills.&nbsp; In addition to stealing small, scented soaps in the shape of Chairman Mao's head, popping the freshness seals on freshly cleaned toilets. misdirecting room service to deliver big juicy steaks to vegetarians and speaking with a bad Chinese accent picked up around, say Cuba, he will be on the ready to steal what Ya Ya has been after for years... the ancient Chinese secret from their laundry services.&nbsp; With it, she could develop secret weapons that could wrinkle freshly pressed clothes within a 50-mile radius of ground zero.&nbsp; There is nothing worse than a wrinkled news anchor, which could effectively destroy the morale of the entire city, or more unthinkable, New Jersey.   Finally, on  Wednesday, October 15, 2003 , we are lucky to find a secret message from BTB to the Ya Ya. (Don't you just love secret code?)&nbsp; "Becca" confirms the chilling effectiveness from Ya Ya's push cart tests and agrees that they should arm Ya Ya's crack whore soldiers with them.&nbsp; Sashaying down the streets on roller skates, and gaudy outfits stolen from the rack of  Frederick's of Hollywood , her crackerjack crack whores will take out the strongest citizens of New York first by snapping their spine from the impact of their shopping cart and then carting off the body in their cart as if it is just another homeless person dressed smartly in an Armani suit.&nbsp; Feeling overly confident, BTB uses the name of her best undercover agent, Mr. Lovan Tomas, and leader of her below 14" feline spy ring.   In her last post for the day, Ya Ya confesses her plan, once again symbolically hidden in code, to steal the testicles of every man in the world.&nbsp; Yes, she talks about someone stealing a baseball at a game, but it only makes patent her true intent for the society she wishes to create - Boys Without Balls (BWB).&nbsp; What diabolical purpose can she have for all of these bollocks?&nbsp; Stay tuned.

      As an insider to the Yaya Empire, it is in great hush-hushness that I expose the true Yaya to you all. I can only do this as she and Chris the Great are overseas.  (I have just finished watching The Bourne Identity and I think I can take over the world, one assassin at a time!) Let us look at a little background history, shall we?   We know that she was born and raised in Louisiana.  She supposedly had a full childhood with regular trips to visit family out of town. Records indicate one arrest when she was just in high school. (Once? In high school??? What????) She was smuggling illegal immigrants in from the borders of Mexico. One can only assume that these immigrants would serve as minions to her ever growing empire.    Is Yaya really in Italy? Do you really believe that she's on a "honeymoon"? Stay tuned to find out.......

       WHO IS THE YA YA EMPRESS?    Hey there, it's Jef from  urlLink Cult of Je f in his first ever guest blog, while Ya Ya Empress and Chris the Great are in Italy.&nbsp; I hope they are having a wonderful time.   To tell you the truth, I don't know Ya Ya (May I call you Ya Ya?) very well.&nbsp; We just collided like two people trying to carry several drinks back to our individual groups of friends in a bar one night, but I just keep coming back to learn more.&nbsp; She's kind of like those little chocolate covered pretzels - you can't eat just one.   So, I thought I might explore and ask the questions others may be too afraid to ask: Who is Ya Ya Empress?&nbsp; What is her evil plan for world domination?&nbsp; Where does she keep her secret chocolate stash?&nbsp; I am determined to probe Ya Ya...  deeply .&nbsp;   First, what is a ya ya?&nbsp; Ya can be an acronym for "Young Adult" and "Yet Another."&nbsp; It is also the feminine for yo yo in the lost Serbian language Shoolencrouch, which links her roots back to the once powerful country of Hotchglosia, whose descendents have now fled to an underground of retail terrorism, flooding American stores with useless Ronco rip-off's such as pasta bowls with built-in colanders, shoes with retractable wheels and devices to bejewel denim jackets.   Secondly, what is an empress?&nbsp;  urlLink Dictionary.com  defines an empress as the woman ruler of an empire or the wife or widow of an emperor.&nbsp; This can mean only one thing.&nbsp; Chris the Great is secret Russian royalty and he has been replaced for her own dark purposes by a him-bot, which is a robot duplicate of the original Christ the Great.&nbsp; She can now rule through her puppet pawn with no one being the wiser... except me, the thorn in her diabolical side.   To begin my research, I have started with her  urlLink first post  from Thursday, October 12, 2003, and I have determined that Ya Ya is a drug user.&nbsp; That's right! You heard it here first.&nbsp; She engages in the dangerous practice of mixing over-the-counter medications together for a Theraflu/Nyquil cocktail.&nbsp; She obviously does not understand how to responsibly use Nyquil. It should only be used to treat colds, sedate hyperactive children and as a morning beverage.&nbsp; Further information gleamed from this post indicates her culvert operation is centered in Midtown Manhattan, which the Muppets once took quite successfully.&nbsp; When she isn't plotting to take over the world, Ya Ya likes to further explore her flannel fetish, which she innocently refers to as PJ's,&nbsp;at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that she believes in the institution of marriage to throw us all off into believing that she is a humble housewife and not&nbsp;the international woman of mystery that she is.&nbsp; She closes her message by waxing on about her enthusiasm for Christian holidays wrapped in pagan traditions and and a future rendezvous with her family, AKA her henchmen/henchwomen.&nbsp; While this may look like a harmless post, I was able to have it analyzed by one of our country's top encryptologists, Dr. Hubert E. Pickens at the University of Podunkville, Alabama.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a special computer program, Dr. Pickens revealed that this post contains a secret message, which is "More diamonds needed for the death ray.&nbsp; Send salami immediately."   I will close for now, but if I should disappear, do not be surprised if the CIA shall contact you in code here.

      O.K. thought I had this blog thing figured out but tried to post something a minute ago and it just disappeared on me!  Maybe this one will go through.  So I guess YAYA and Chris the Great are just about ready to leave for their Italian vacation, wish I was going with them.  It will be interesting to see what will happen to her blog while she is away!

      So tonight, Chris-the-Great & I went to a little bar called Faces &amp; Names on 54th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues.&nbsp; Nice little spot, but there has been so much turnover at The Essex House (Hotel), that I don't even know half the people anymore.&nbsp; But I did get to see my favorite gay friend - Damien.&nbsp; He's so absolutely fabulous that he could entertain me all night - not to mention what happens when he gets together with Chris.&nbsp; They ham it up big time!&nbsp; Damien is in some sort of position at The Essex House where he deals with big name stars and their press junkets, etc. that are held at the hotel.&nbsp; He seems to know everyone!   We went&nbsp;to wish Mai good luck on her trip back to Japan, which is where she is from.&nbsp; She'll be going back for good & we wish her the best!&nbsp; Another hotel friend, Kelly, is moving to a little French island for a year.&nbsp; She's saved up enough money and now she's going to spend the next year lounging on a French beach and studying for the LSAT trying to get into law school.&nbsp; That's awesome, too!   Chris-the-Great & I watched a video about Rome last night.&nbsp; It was so exciting and I want to watch it again before we go.&nbsp; We'll start packing this weekend so there's time to run out and pick up&nbsp;anything we're missing&nbsp;before we leave Wednesday.   I'm sitting here posting since I left Chris-the-Great at the bar.&nbsp; You ever just get ancy and need to leave a place?&nbsp; That's what happened tonight & when I told Chris-the-Great that I needed to go, he thought I would be upset that he wanted to stay for another hour or so.&nbsp; I gave him my blessings and he walked me to 7th Avenue, hailed a cab, kissed me&nbsp;and handed me&nbsp;cab fare.&nbsp; I love him.

      Today, the minutes ticked away at a granny snail's pace at work. It should have been at least two days - that's how long it was! And I didn't have a single thing to do pretty much the entire day besides track down presentations for our Production Dept that my boss was reviewing. Oh, and I strutted around in my new white skirt with the purple and tan flowers on it that I bought yesterday, along with the purple v-neck shirt that matches. Everyone has complimented me on it - even my boss who for the past 3 years has taken absolutely no notice of what I've worn. Today he says, "I really like what you have on today." I'm like, "Thanks!" And that was that.&nbsp; Until I get off the train today at my stop after work.&nbsp; I walk down the first set of stairs, go through the turnstile, round the corner and nearly bump into a girl wearing my skirt and a lighter purple shirt.&nbsp; Damn, thought I'd gotten hold of a good skirt there, but now I'm afraid I'll be seeing it everywhere.   The weather is really crappy today and if I remember correctly, the weather report this morning was for monsoon-like rains. Lovely. Because that's the kind of rain we've had the entire day. Perhaps one day soon it will decide to get sunny & warm before "summer" is over. Oh! Lightening just now! With the faintest hint of thunder. What I wouldn't give to be back on the farm with a nice tin roof listening to that rain come down!   From what I hear, my nephew, Jackson, is in Louisiana having a good ole time. It's been reported that he loves this Grandaddy's new pond and tractor. His grandmother, Mimi as we call her, has already bought him a pair of rubber boots and some new tennis shoes - or sneakers as these Yankees call them - and some sandals.   Oh! I nearly forgot - I saw a girl get hit by a car yesterday! Ok, maybe I should say that with a little less enthusiasm: i saw a girl get hit by a car yesterday. She wasn't really hurt. She was jaywalking and a cab driver was backing up so he could parallel park along 49th Street &amp; 7th Avenue. He bumped her and she did the rollover & flip thing in her teeny tiny skirt. I'm sure someone caught sight of her undies, but not me. Not that I'm interested in that sort of thing - you know, other girls undies. Anyway, all's well &amp; good with her, I guess, though I imagine her leg has to hurt today where he hit her.   So earlier, I ventured over to Newsfeed - News for Bloggers, News for Junkies, where I stumbled upon this story:     urlLink US food scientists working for the US military have developed a dried food ration that troops can hydrate by adding dirty water or urine.   Now, I don't know about you, but I just don't think I could live with myself knowing that I rehydrated my food by pissing on it. I just couldn't do it. You?   And then I read a story on MSNBC.com today that tells us what we already know:  urlLink Howard Stern, blogs and voter virgins hold the key to the election.    I watched this video a couple of weeks ago, but since I've heard about it all over the news I figured people might be looking for the link to  urlLink This Land &nbsp;by brothers Greg and Evan Spiridellis.&nbsp; It's a spoof of this fabulous show we call Election Year 2004.&nbsp; Watch it!&nbsp; You'll love it!

      So Chris-the-Great was on the Graham Norton Effect last night.&nbsp; His part was about 45 minutes into the show.&nbsp; They were doing a scene where earlier, they sent an audience member backstage to be painted so that he could hide in plain site on the streets of Manhattan.&nbsp; As soon as Graham Norton spotted the guy, they called him on his cell phone to see if that was him.&nbsp; That was Chris-the-Great's cue to walk this dog past the guy.&nbsp; Chris stopped and started talking to the guy and his dog started sniffing the guy's crotch.&nbsp; They don't show Chris-the-Great's face, which is good since they'll be able to use him again this season.&nbsp; Once they show his face, that's it until next season.&nbsp; I'm so proud of him!&nbsp; I know this was no big part or anything, but it's a start and it will give him some experience with TV and he got paid.&nbsp; Always a good thing!  I am so ready to sleep in a bit on Saturday.&nbsp; I woke up yesterday morning thinking it was Saturday - you can imagine my disappointment when I realized that the alarm&nbsp;going off was meant to wake me up early for a reason.  Tomorrow, I'm heading out to New Jersey for what I hope is atleast a&nbsp;dry day if not sunny.&nbsp; I bought a&nbsp;new swimming suit yesterday even though I may not get to use it.&nbsp; Ok, I must go get ready for work.

      So Chris-the-Great did a spot on the Graham Norton Effect but I don't know when it will air.&nbsp; Sometime next week, I would assume but since I don't watch it all the time, I don't really know when it comes on.&nbsp; I'll let you know more as I find out more.   Anyway, Olivia & I went out for martinis last night - my first martini.&nbsp; I had one raspberry, one strawberry and one apple which I didn't finish.&nbsp; I would have been sick if I had finished the third one especially since I hadn't had dinner yet.&nbsp; I came home to pig out of Wheat Thins and cheese sprinkled with Tony Chacherey's seasoning.   So this time week, we'll be on a plane to Italy!&nbsp; Three days in Rome, three days in Florence & three days in Venice.&nbsp; I'm so ready for some vacation!&nbsp; But first, this Saturday, I'm going to a coworkers house in New Jersey.&nbsp; I'm meeting up with 3 or 4 other girls from work to take the hour long bus trip.&nbsp; We'll be hanging out by the pool all day drinking so it's good no ones driving.&nbsp; Maybe I'll come away with a little bit of a tan.&nbsp; I may have to go buy a new swimming suit.

      Mr. Mike & Jackson left at 6:15 this morning for Louisiana.&nbsp; I enjoyed their visit, but I sure wish&nbsp;our aptartment was&nbsp;bigger.&nbsp; I've been up since 5 am, so I'm looking forward to turning in early tonight.  &nbsp;  After 3 martinies (Raspberry, Strawberry & Apple) with Olivia after work today, I am finally home watching BIG on the Discovery Channel.&nbsp; Chris-the-Great is off taping some segment on the  urlLink Graham Norton Effect .&nbsp; I'll let you know when it is supposed to air.&nbsp; I'm proud of Chris-the-Great!&nbsp; It's taken some time but I think he's finally found something that captures his attention and he finds interesting - improve/sketch comedy, not the Graham Norton Effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've been cruising through what blogs I can at work, but our IT dept blocks so many of my daily reads.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, let me tell you about this:&nbsp; I think maybe I can't remember who reminded me why blogging is for me, but here goes:&nbsp; It's the glimpses into someone's life - their everyday mundane life - that they choose to share with me.&nbsp; It's those priveleged moments that they&nbsp;choose to pass along to those they've never met.&nbsp; It's sweet & kind moments that they think no one will give a rat's ass about, and yet they post it anyway not really knowing why.&nbsp; It's the drunkin posts I give after going out drinking with Olivia.

      Chris-the-Great had his level 2 graduation show this afternoon &amp; they were great!&nbsp; 10 times better than his level 1 graduation show, but they've worked their asses off and it shows.&nbsp; I'm very proud of him! &nbsp; Other than that, we didn't do a whole lot today.&nbsp; After his show, Chris-the-Great and his classmates went out for a couple of drinks while Mike, Cindy &amp; I came home&nbsp;and watched  urlLink Love Actually .&nbsp; Great movie though it seems they could have made a couple of movies out of all of those characters and we could have gotten to know all of the characters a little better.&nbsp; But then again, it would have been a totally different movie.&nbsp; So, long story short, I loved  urlLink Love Actually ! &nbsp; Last night, we went to eat at this place called  urlLink Neo's  which does this fusion sushi &amp; it was fabulou!&nbsp; It was a little pricey, but definitely worth it.&nbsp; Afterward, we went to UCB and watched the 9 pm show -  urlLink Respecto Good vs. Elvis .&nbsp; Very funny indeed! &nbsp; That's about it really.&nbsp; Chris-the-Great &amp; Mike are watching  urlLink The Road Warrior  on TV.&nbsp; Very strange movie.&nbsp; Funny to watch it now that it's over 20 years old (1981).&nbsp; The costumes are great, let me tell ya.&nbsp; And great storyline.&nbsp; Ok, not really. &nbsp; Mike has one more day here in NYC.&nbsp; Cindy is taking off work tomorrow so they can all hang out.&nbsp; Early Tuesday morning, Mike is taking Jackson, my nephew, back to Louisiana for about a month.&nbsp; And since Chris-the-Great's parents are building their new barn on their 80 or so acres of land in  urlLink Richland Parish , Jackson will have plenty to keep him busy.&nbsp; I hear there's some wood that needs stacking &amp; some turtles that need to come out of the new pond.&nbsp; Ah yes, cheap child labor!&nbsp; All in exchange for a little spending money, some tractor &amp; 4-wheeler driving among other fun stuff.&nbsp; I wish I were going!

      Another day, another random trip to Brooklyn.&nbsp; Well, Coney Island anyway.&nbsp; My father-in-law, Mike, came in yesterday from Louisiana.&nbsp; He's staying with us this time around.&nbsp; Friday night, Mike, Cindy &amp; I went to see Chicago starring Paige Davis as Roxie Hart.&nbsp; While the show was great &amp; I love me some Paige Davis, there was a woman in black leather underwear &amp; fishnet body stocking&nbsp;who had a fantastic body!&nbsp; I think I was watching her more than ole Paige.&nbsp; I'm glad Chris-the-Great wasn't there or he'd have left me on the spot.  &nbsp;  Anyway, today, Mike, Jackson &amp; I went to Chinatown and then on to Coney Island on a whim.&nbsp; We had time to kill.&nbsp; Mike &amp; I had never been to Coney Island &amp; I definitely want to go back when I have more time.&nbsp; We walked along the boardwalk and onto this great long pier where people were throwing crab&nbsp;baskets out with raw chicken.&nbsp; They were catching these small crabs that really weren't worth eating, so I don't know why they were keeping them.&nbsp; Not my problem.&nbsp; We ended up riding the Q train from one end (at Coney Island) to the other end (at 57th Street).  &nbsp;  Afterward, we met up with Cindy, John &amp; Chris to go eat at Neo's, which is a Japanese Fusion Sushi restaurant.&nbsp; Nice place &amp; some of the best sushi I've had yet.&nbsp; A little pricey, but great!&nbsp; After that, we went to the UCB and watched Respecto Montebon during the 9 pm show.&nbsp; Now I'm about to head to bed.&nbsp; Chris-the-Great has to go to work in the morning - 7 am.&nbsp; Poor thing.&nbsp; I'm planning on sleeping in until Berg wakes me.

      Happy Hump Day!  I've got some good ones for you today!   urlLink The Shining in 30 Seconds & by bunnies .   urlLink The Exorcist in 30 Seconds & by bunnies .

      I found  urlLink this video  via Daniel at  urlLink ...was I there?  and it is hilarious!!  Warning!!  Not safe for work & you'll need your speakers.  Chris-the-Great and I are about to go watch some improv comedy at the UCB.  I haven't been since Brad & Beth were up here for a visit.  Update on Mamaw Ilva:  [Background: she had a heart attack Saturday and was in ICU; she's 80-yrs-old] She's in a room now and is in high spirits & says she never been so popular with all of the phone calls & flowers, etc.  She sounds good and I could hear my Papaw Leo coughing in the background when I called.  They're going to try to regulate her blood pressure with medicine and start her on a cardiac rehab program.  There's no blockage, which is good, cause we're beef people.  Maybe that's a good side effect of a diet rich in home grown red meats & vegetables.  Gotta love her!  Well, I should go pull Chris-the-Great away from his Playstation.  He's been playing XIII which is a RPG or role playing game.

      Last night, Chris-the-Great & I went to hang out with some friends we hadn't seen in about a year.  They moved to Washington DC, bought a house & had another kid - they already had one.  It was really great to see them & I didn't realize how much I'd missed them until I saw them again last night.  They will leave Monday morning so I think we're going to hang out with them again this afternoon - after I do laundry & before going to the  urlLink UCB  tonight.

      I'm a wee bit upset right now because I just found out that my grandmother had a heart attack.  My parents are on their way there now, but I can't seem to put it out of my head regardless of the fact that there's nothing I can do for anyone this far away from home.  I called my sister, Cat, and she's promised to call me no matter the time of day or night if she hears anything.  I can only wish her the best and that she'll begin feeling better soon & perhaps that her doctors will step up and treat her instead of trying to pass her heart problems off on her gall bladder or whatever other lame excuse they can come up with.  I wish I were there at the hospital with them.

      And now for your Saturday links:  These are some  urlLink pretty cool bears , just run your pointer over them.  And here's a little story about a couple who attended a concert but then decided they wanted to play a  urlLink more active role .  Lord, may I never drink that much that I would do something like that!  I just don't know that many people who would have sex on stage at a concert.  This is a fun little  urlLink optical illusion  - it's just a little hard to look at first thing in the morning.  And from the same website, I found a picture of  urlLink this toilet  that I've heard so much about.  You can see outside the toilet, but they can't see in.  Crazy!  I wish I knew where this was.  I've been waiting for this to come out for a while now:  urlLink Kerry Poppa .  The game where John Kerry's head explodes.  Loving it.

       urlLink Anchorman with Will Ferrell  was pretty funny - not as funny as Dodgeball, but funny.  Chris-the-Great is about to go out with his friends & I'm staying home since I had enough Jack & Coke last night to tide me over through tonight.  I'm about to watch VH1's Behind The Music: Guns-N-Roses.  They played this the other day and people raved about this, so I can't not watch it.  I'm obviously not the only one who has noticed this, but thanks to Rita of  urlLink Res Ipsa Loquitur  & Matt of  urlLink Drudge Report 2004 , we can all get one collaborative look at what's unfolding in front of our very eyes. I'd like to join in in saying: GET A ROOM!!  I haven't had time to check out the entire site, but you should  urlLink Play along with the Saddam Hussein Dead Pool ! Thanks to  urlLink Becca  for that one!

      I'm sorry Cat, but it seems that you may never get your chance at Kenny Rogers. He's just become the  urlLink father of twins . (He has 3 children from a previous marriage.)  I think most of us have seen The Passion of the Christ and are now familiar with the actor who played Jesus, James (Jim) Caviezel. It seems that on a recent trip to New Mexico, the locals mistook him for the real thing and began  urlLink requesting miracles from the actor .  Just wondering: Why is it that just about every IT dept I've come across are full of a bunch of arrogant b@st@rds? Not only are they arrogant, but they have also blocked half of the blogs I read at work. A$$hats!!  Harvey over at  urlLink Bad Example  has answered the Precision Guided Humor assignment of coming up with a  urlLink theme song for Michael Moore .  By the way, a belated HAPPY BIRTHDAY goes our to our own el presidente: George W Bush!  Sorry, I'm late with that big man!  Thanks to  urlLink Uptown Girl  who gave me something fun to do that didn't include porn.  She has a  urlLink picture of Kerry & Edwards and invites you to supply a caption  in the comments section.  There are some pretty funny ones already posted, but I challenge anyone to give it a whirl!  And last, by far far not least, thanks to Court of  urlLink Viva la France  for her recipe for Fromage Blanc or Creole Cream Cheese!!  I've personally never had it, but I'm willing to give it a shot.  Fromage Blanc or Creole Cream Cheese 1 gallon skim milk 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 Rennet tablet (you can find these in the grocery store by the ice cream toppings)  Heat milk to 80 or 90 degrees. Stir in buttermilk and rennet and set aside at room temperature. If you have to cover it, use cheesecloth. After 24 hours, you will have curds. Pour this into a mold (I used a colandar or you can get a plastic container and punch holes in the bottom) and allow to drain for another day or so.   The fromage is ready when it's no longer dripping.  In Louisiana, they usually pour cream or half and half over it to serve. You can also find recipes using fromage blanc/creole cream cheese from Chef John Folse and Emeril. It can be both a dessert or a meal-type food. For example, in Alsace, they serve it with garlic, onions, and roasted potatoes.  A couple notes on texture--when I finished mine, it had the consistency of ricotta. To get it more like French fromage blanc, I poured a little milk and half and half in it and used a blender to whip it.  Oh, and if you're a Fromage Blanc virgin, the best way to eat this is with strawberries. And maybe a little sugar on top.  Delish.

      Ok, onto the soapbox: I'm getting irritated again. One of my friends is so very moody & a little b*tchy. Instead of getting bent out of shape over it, I'm trying not to let it bother me. I just hate it when she's in one of her "moods." I don't need that kind of shit on my Tuesday-that-feels-like-Monday. Update: she's being nicer now. Her Midol must have kicked in.  In the political arena, John Kerry has finally made a decision for once in his life: He's chosen John Edwards as his VP running mate. I can honestly say that if John Edwards had been the Democratic pick, I would be having a harder time deciding whom to vote for in November. As it is, I can't stand John Kerry and would rather not associate myself with that man at all. I know others can say the same for George Bush, but this is my blog and I'll decide whom I vote for.  You liked those 2 uses of the word "whom" didn't you? Ok, so I never would have chosen them if spellcheck hadn't picked up on it but it does make me sound smarter, now doesn't it?  In Vacation News: we got our passports early Saturday morning! The mailman rang my bell while I was half asleep, though I did have enough wits about me to remember to pull on a robe. Thanks be to Jesus cause I was wearing a little Victoria's Secret pink ballet slip that is oh-so-comfortable!  Unfortunately, I just found out that our camera that we loaned to Sergio was stolen while he was in Puerto Rico. We lost our $300 camera and $100 memory card and he lost over 150 pictures - and some were pretty wild from what I hear! I'm not that stressed about the camera since Sergio said he would replace it, but I hate that he's out that money and that he's lost all of those pictures. Lesson learned: things get stolen in Puerto Rico.  For the good of your funny bone,  urlLink click here !  You like that  urlLink farting cat , don't you?  Chris-the-Great saw it and sat there giggling on the couch with tears rolling down his face.  It must be a good one.  OK, last one.  I promise!  Here's a funny joke for you no matter what your religion:  There were 3 good arguments that Jesus was black  1. He called everyone "brother"  2. He liked Gospel  3. He couldn't get a fair trial   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Jewish:  1. He went into His Fathers business  2. He lived at home until he was 33  3. He was sure his Mother was a virgin and his mother was sure he was God.   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Italian:  1. He talked with his hands  2. He had wine with every meal  3. He used olive oil   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was a Californian:  1. He never cut his hair  2. He walked around barefoot all the time  3. He started a new religion   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Irish:  1. He never got married  2. He was always telling stories  3. He loved green pastures   But the most compelling evidence of all - 3 proofs that Jesus was a WOMAN:  1. He had to feed a crowd at a moment's notice when there was no food  2. He kept trying to get a message across to a bunch of men who just didn't get it  3. Even when he was dead, He had to get up because there was more work for him to do.

      Happy 4th of July!!  I especially want to wish our friend Jeremy who is in Baghdad right now searching for insurgents &  urlLink Blackjack , of course, because he's in Iraq, too.  What did yall do for the 4th?  Chris-the-Great & I went down to Astoria Park here in Queens.  We layed out for a while and played frisbie & threw the football back and forth.  Then we walked along the water toward Hoyt Avenue.  We stopped at one spot underneath the Triboro Bridge and when the waves washed ashore, you could hear the water going over all of the glass.  It made a tinkling sound.  Crazy.  There was so much trash and garbage washed up it was pretty nasty.  Hope everyone has had a good weekend and if you're off tomorrow, drink a beer for me!

      Spider Man 2 was an excellent movie!  At least twice as good as the first movie - perhaps better.  Chris-the-Great was cheering like a little boy in a toy store.  Tonight, he's at class and then he's going to watch a little improv.  I'm sitting here watching Most Extreme Elimination Challenge on Spike TV.  I love this show!  It's basically just footage of people falling and hurting themselve, but it's a Japanese game show dubbed over by some very sarcastic Americans.  Mucho funny!  So Chris-the-Great bought an English-to-Italian phrase book yesterday and we've been learning a few words every day.  I can't wait!  I've already started buying some small things for our trip but I still need to get a converter for our electronics.  We're bringing our laptop, so I hope to post during the trip.  Later this month, Mr. Mike (my father-in-law), Cindy & I will be going to see  urlLink Chicago  starring Paige Davis from TLC's Trading Spaces.  Ok, I'm going to nap on the couch for a bit until Sergio comes down to borrow our small digital camera since he's heading to Puerto Rico for a bit.

Does falling into it really count?  Better go look for the super glue.  (*opens large drawer in the kitchen*).  Now why, oh why, would somebody have so many batteries?!

       IN ZE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME   Dear purveyors of freedom:  I am writing this from an Apple Store in the  urlLink Tlaquepaque Arts and Crafts Village  in Sedona, Arizona.  I barely escaped the truck stop when I was ambushed by the pussy posse. I turned around just as the hind quarters of a tortoise shell landed in my face. I would have been blinded if it were not for my cheap, imitation J-Lo sunglasses. It's not easy subduing ninja kitties, but luckily I was able to wield saltwater taffy like a whip, a little skill I picked up from dating an American Airlines flight attendant with an Indiana Jones fetish. "Oh Professor Jones, open up my ancient tomb." By the time I was through with them, the only thing you could see was their little tails whipping back and forth from under a Ms. Pac-Man machine.  I trust no one now. In order to blend in with the locals, I have begun wearing a black beret, a t-shirt with black horizontal stripes and painted a thin black moustache on my upper lip. I speak in a fake French accent and spy on suspicious characters by pretending to paint on my easel. The fact that I do not have a canvas seems unimportant to others. I know Ya Ya's hidden lair is somewhere in the iron mountain. I suspect her testicular ray canon is in there, waiting to steal the testicles of men all over ze planet, replacing them with little wooden decoys. I must have proof to be sure, dear readers, therefore, tomorrow I head down into the Sunshine Valley Nudist Colony to see if I can knock on wood.  Stay tuned. I feel Mr. Lovan Tomas is near; something smells fishy.  Resistantly Yours,  Jef

      Ah ha! and Oh No!!! It seems that my cover has been blown. Mr. Lovan Tomas has been pulled from the operations and put in the warehouse to oversee the training of the other kittens. He will for sure make our little kitten rebels the most rebellious yet! (How did this Jef know that Mr. Lovan Tomas was orange? How?) We have sent his "sister" Sativa in his place. She is equipped with the voice of Shel Silverstein. No one will ever suspect those big "Puss in Boots" eyes to be pushing a laundry cart. I have also sent our neighbor's oldest boy. He isn't much for taking orders, but he can't stay away from cute kittens.  You might recognize him when you see him reading a Ramona Quimby book.   Yaya checked in with headquarters this morning from Florence, Italy. She says that Italy is beautiful. I wonder if she'd had time to "make friends" there.   As Yaya's next of kin here, I am honored to wish Bridget Marie Verret a very HAPPY BRITHDAY!!!!! And I shall sing...."HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU. I'M SO GLAD YOU WOKE UP! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUUUUUUU!!!!" I hope you have a great birthday and we see you soon!  Well, until the next mission.....

       ON THE RUN FROM MR. LOVAN TOMAS &amp; THE 14" FELINE SPY RING   I am writing to you from a 24-hour truck stop just outside of Licking, Missouri. The warm glow of the neon flamingos and palm trees seemed comforting. I had to leave Atlanta quite suddenly when I heard the doorbell ring. I placed my ear against the door and heard several cats meowing in hushed tones. Suddenly, one of them tried the doorknob and I was out the back door like a cork out of a champagne bottle at a New Year's party for AA members with esteem issues.  I'm afraid that I just have a few items that I grabbed while in fight or flight mode. Looking at them now, it's clear to me that a state of panic is not the best frame of mind to be in when deciding what supplies to take when you have become a political fugitive. I have a lip balm, nail clippers, some beef jerkey, a copy of Ricky Martin's greatest hits and a box of Jello pistachio pudding mix. I'm sure McGyver could do wonders, but I will probably have to venture over the Dairy Queen on the other side of the truck stop for sustenance.  I thought I had lost them when I crossed the border into Alabama. Feeling confident, I stopped to get something to eat. When I returned from the restroom, I found an entire pussy patrol ordering combo meals. What was I thinking when I stopped at  Captain D's ? I managed to escape with the cats in hot pursuit. I jumped onto the back of an 18-wheeler and shouted at them in a mocking tone, "Ha! Try to get me you bunch of pussies!" However, my arrogance soon dissipated as I saw an orange tabby hoist a rocket launcher onto his shoulder while a cool calico lined me up in the crosshairs. Fortunately, the truck just made it over the top of the hill and vanished as I saw a nearby billboard for Stuckey's erupt into flames.  What do they want from me? What do they think I have? Well, I do know one thing - they'll never catch me alive. Wait! Of course, they must want-  What's that sound? OH NO!

       HAPPY HALLOWEEN !  Today was a good day.  I was up until 2am carving the jack-o-lantern, which sort of sounds like a solo sex device that brings enlightenment.  The face was easy to carve, but the words "Trick-or-Treat" were rather difficult.  The words actually shine on the wall behind the pumpkin.  It looked good.  I came home early to beat traffic and took a nap with Buddy.  We watched a two-part episode of "Coupling" where Steve accidently sees Sally's naked bottom.  Sally is the best friend of his girlfriend, Susan.  This show is so funny and so bang-on (I sound so British) in its statements about men and women.  I also liked Jane's truth snake... especially when it started arguing with her.  Jeff dressed up like the grim reaper of death.  He put some sort of glow stick attachment in his mouth and it made his mouth glow.  It was very popular with the kids.  They will probably try to imitate him with some radioactive waste that is just laying around the house and you can imagine the rest.  Julie, Donald's girlfriend, came over and helped us count trick-or-treaters and hand out candy.  Steve and Mark also came over.  They ate candy and drank beer.  Mark was sort of trigger-happy with the fog machine.  However, he was not sitting in firing range like Julie and I were.  Joan came over later and we ate chili-cheese dip and toasted pumpkin seeds.  The kids were fun.  We had 124 trick-or-treaters, which was down from last year's 175.  Julie dressed as a witch.  Mark and Steve were dressed as sailors.  (I always wanted to go as a sailor.  Perhaps next year....)  Joan was a telecommuter in a bathrobe.  I dressed comfortably and told people I was sporty spice.  One kid came back to tell Jeff that he was not scared of him and told Jeff he was going to beat him down with his stick.  Jeff reached out and took the stick and the kid ran off never to be seen again.  About 9pm we drove over to Six Feet Under, which is a pub and fish house across from historic Oakland Cemetery.  We received a table on the roof and had a great view of the cemetery and downtown.  We had fun.  Jeff treated everyone to dinner.  It was nice.  I'm listening to Whigfield these days.  She is an ex-Danish model that began recording dance music with Italian producers.  Her 1994 hit, "Saturday Night," went into the UK charts at #1 because of its popularity during the summer at Ibizia.  It's throw-away pop music, but I like it.

       THIS HAD BETTER @#*% WORK!  Okay.  Perhaps the third time is the charm.  I wrote a lovely entry and lost it twice.  The interface on this Web site is a bit different from the previous Web site.  My great aunt, Priscilla, called me this morning to tell me she loved me, was thinking of me and now has unlimited long distance.  Then she hung up on me.  Buddy threw up on my comforter.  I washed it and she seems fine now.  She's sleeping in her little cat bed that I bought for her at Target.  I would hate to think that I spent $7.99 in vain.  Robert and I met with Deborah today regarding investment opportunities.  I'm really excited about working with her because I believe she really wants to help people get into homes that might not have the opportunity without our help.  Our office went to dinner with the staff of our primary lender this evening at Stoney River.  The food was good.  What did I have again?  Oh yeah... orange glazed sesame trout.  Fish is good for the memory.  Fish is good for the memory.    Carol Lynn, our president, told us that the only reason her parents sent her to the University of Georgia was to find a husband.  She used to write her married name over and over in class.  She failed math three times and look at her now; she's a mortgage queen!  I visited Julie Brown's Web site, which is   urlLink www.juliebrown.com .  It was fun to watch the video for "Trapped In The Body Of A White Girl."  You can also give Sheena Easton a makeover.  What fun!

       I LOVE "COUPLING"!   Well, I love the BBC series. The British series is so funny. I don't understand why the American series is unfunny. On my way home from work, I used my Borders gift certificate that my sister, Vicki, sent me for my birthday and bought Series 2 of "Coupling." I watched the episode where Steve thought Susan's parents meant masturbation when they said whistling, but they really meant just whistling. It ranks up there with "Lesbian Spank Inferno."   Work went well today. Robert and I worked on our realtor packet. We are working on making connections with realtors to refer us business. It can be very slow in the beginning. Robert and I work so differently. He is like a house fly randomly flying from task to task. I tend to finish a task and move on to the next task depending on the urgency. I think I could accomplish much more quickly on my own, but Robert is much better with the sales pitch and talking to people. Then again, I don't want to be dependent upon him. I watched a sales training tape yesterday and have been applying the principles. We complement each other well.   Carol Lynn, my boss, is the only woman who has ever made me use the "F" word. She truly is fabulous! She is such a pleasure to work with and so inpsiring. She mentioned that she thought Robert and I should send out a weekly newsletter via e-mail and suggested an audio/visual e-mail that someone sent her. Perhaps my degree in Multimedia and Web design will now pay off. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!   I will now use the "~" because it tragically receives so little attention. Sigh....   I also went to the volunteer meeting for "Out On Film". It was sort of subdued. The head guy, Paul, spoke for a few minutes and then we signed up for a few shifts. I was hoping to meet some other people that are serious about film making that I could connect with and interest in turning one of my short scripts into a video or film. Perhaps it will happen in the future. The link to the Web site is  urlLink http://www.outonfilm.com/ . On the plus side, I saw the Robbie Williams video for "Feel" and "Dancing Queen" from Kylie's "Impossible Princess" tour.   Tonight, Jeff and I watched the very first episode of "Coupling" together. He laughed a lot and very hard. He likes Jane too. It made me happy. :)

       GIVE ME A HAND, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL....   It's been a busy past few days.  Out On Film is over.  I had a much better time on Thursday and Saturday.  Jane Fonda came on Thursday, but I think she was there to see one of the regular films at the Landmark Theater.  Jeff met her once and didn't realize who she was.  He said she looked matronly.  I think I understand what he meant.  She looked good.  She was dressed very nice, but like a woman near sixty.  She definitely left the Barbarella look at home.  The concert to save the fountains was on Friday.  It was a big success.  I had to change clothes, which I was not happy about.  It was also cold.  However, I did have the opportunity to talk with my neighbor who was also volunteering.  One of the DJ's from the local public radio stations was there.  I forgot his name, but recognized his voice.  He looked like he was my age.  I always thought he was old and bald.    Jeff's best friend is Jeff Hutchinson from Canada.  Jeff's father died Friday night.  He had been sick with cancer for a year, but took an unexpected downward turn.  Jeff made a reservation to fly to Detroit and take the airbus to London, Ontario.  Meanwhile, I had to clean house before my final volunteer shift at the film festival.  Jeff was also making dinner for his pastor and a few people from the neighborhood.  We were running late on dinner, but the green apple martinis seemed to distract the guests.  I walked to CVS to get some ice.  There is always a wait at CVS, but somehow everyone seemed to worry about me as if I had staggered off and was asleep in a dumpster.  It seemed to go well.  I got up with every intention of going to church on Sunday, but there was so much to do before Jeff left.  I wrote a note to Jeff H. and took Jeff to the airport.  I went to check on Joan's cats and went by the grocery store to buy a small salad and pizza.  I folded laundry and watched another "Will & Grace" DVD.  That show is so funny!  I woke up last night expecting to see Jeff, but only found Buddy's fuzzy butt staring me in my face.  Tonight on VH1 Classic I saw the video for Shakespear's Sister's "Heroine."  I almost squealed with delight.  I also caught the video for the Runaways' "Saturday Night Special."  The Runaways never seem to get the credit they are due.  I also received "The Hit Factory - The Best Of Stock Aitken Waterman" CD from the UK.  This is the CD that I have been trying to get a copy of for the past 17 years.  I've been listening to it over and over again.  I'm also afraid that I have been intrigued with the new Britney Spears CD because of the duet with Madonna.  I will try and resist.  Work has been going well.  One of the big realtors we have been trying to meet with has called and asked us to refinance one of his houses.  We're still pinching ourselves and wanting to do a fantastic job.  Last week, we had one loan in the pipeline that was about to close and a lot of leads on the fence.  Now we have five more loans in the pipeline with a lotmore leads.  My visualization work is paying off.  I'd better get to bed.  I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

       OUT ON FILM   Today started out well, but I'm feeling a bit under the weather.  I arrived home about nine and waited to call Jeff after ten.  I fell asleep and woke up feeling very discombotulated.  Hyacinith was planning her indoor outdoor barbecue with finger buffet.  We chatted for twenty minutes or so.  I have tried going back to sleep, but now I'm awake.  Sigh....  Unfortunately, I don't feel like doing much.  I turned on VH1 Classic and caught the Pet Shop Boys' "West End Girls" video.  This was followed by Aerosmith and Bon Jovi, which seems typical when I turn VH1 Classic on.  However, then they played Madness, the Communards, the The and finally the Lightning Seeds.  What a pleasant surprise!  Today was a so-so day at work.  It didn't seem like I accomplished much.  I did buy stamps though.  I went to volunteer at Out On Film.  I didn't really do much.  They just kept telling me to stand there.  After two hours, I finally asked if they really needed me.  They had the deer in headlights look.  I came home.  I hope there is more for me to do tomorrow.  There were interesting people there though.  Well, I think I'll try to go to sleep again.  Sweet dreams!

       IT WAS A QUIET EVENING IN  INSTANBUL   Well, once again Blogger suddenly crashed and lost my entire post.  It could have been beautiful!  Today was a pretty good day.  Prospects are coming in.  I'm not sure how I'm going to work my finances this holiday season, but I know it will work itself out if I just affirm that it will be okay.  Worry just blocks our good from reaching us.  Jeff was off today and trimmed shrubs.  He had his "Mr. Cranky" persona on this evening.  He's such a great guy, but if you listen to him, he focuses on a lot of negative stuff.  The porch needs pressure washing.  His car needs to be washed.  He didn't pay bills tonight.  He should have got more done.  I wish he would lighten up a bit and live in the moment more often.  I ran around the park this evening.  I took Kylie with me once again.  On a whim, last week I ran with Donna Summer's "On The Radio - Greatest Hits Vol. I & II."  My sister received that double album for Christmas 1979.  We would come home from school and put her records on my mother's big-ass Curtis Mathis entertainment center.  We would bake Mrs. Goodcookies as the stereo caused the walls to thunder and the ground to rumble.  My mother walked in from work one evening and thought we were having an earthquake.  Ah... memories.  I went to Office Depot today and found myself loitering around the PDA's.  I know it would make sense to buy one for work, but I'm trying to avoid the expense at this time.  I also want a business card reader now that I'm a networking fool.  I'm supposed to volunteer at Out On Film tomorrow evening.  I wish I knew what time and where to meet.  I wonder if I have to dress in any particular way?  I'm not particularly impressed at the moment.  I successfully wrote a writing exercise from Julia Cameron's "The Right To Write."  It was the one that I became stuck at over eight months ago.  Go figure!  I went to the official Pet Shop Boys Web site.  I was checking on their new greatest hits compilation entitled "Pop Art."  They have a section where fans can ask questions and Neil and Chris answer.  For example, Immanuel from Mexico City writes the following in question 322:  "Hola, from huge Mexico City (where you know we miss you A LOT) I have this thing on my mind that does not allow me to enjoy my supposedly quiet weekend. Last week I attended this great performance of Superchumbo in Mexico for a French gorgeous boy invited me. We had a great night, we danced almost together, he took some pictures of the two of us and whenever we got close to say something we touched each other backs delicately. He’s always been very nice to me and felt comfortable with his companionship. I took him home and when we said goodbye I asked him if he was gay ( I know, stupid thing)… He said ‘no’ but his explanation took more than sixty minutes. He concluded he was ‘gay friendly’ and enjoyed sharing more time with gay people…cultural shock or not, caprice or not, this made me feel more attracted to him. I honestly think he goes beyond being open. I was close to say he liked me as well, for his signs told me so… however… I only want to kiss him. Do you think I should approach or it could mean I might lose his friendship? Oh my, Europeans are far too complicated for more complicated Latinos."  Neil typed a smart reply, "I guess it's a gamble."  I actually grabbed an old comforter and my favorite pillow and laid on the futon with Buddy and read for half an hour.  It was great.  I'm reading a book about Sydney, Australia, which is my favorite place on earth.  I don't know why I feel so passionately about that Sydney.  It's not like I feel that I lived there in a past life.

       I HAVE NEVER EATEN DOG FOOD   And I'm okay with that.  This evening, I found myself in the grocery store, Publix, with a handful of lettuce, brocolli and asparagus walking down the pet supply aisle.  It occured to me that if I faced impending death, what regrets would I have about unfinished business.  I never ate dog food as a child.  I'm still okay with it.  PowerBreakfast this morning was great.  I woke up at 6:00 AM to be there by 7:00 AM.  I went through four round tables and gave my InfoMinute about my company and our services.  Now I have to follow up with the people I met.  I am a very shy person, but networking is turning out to be a lot of fun.  I worked on my own today and I really enjoyed it.  I found I got a lot more done.  Robert threw his back out.  Perhaps he is not feeling supported by the universe.    I worked from home this afternoon and it's amazing how much time goes by when you're building up your own business.  I just had to make a list of the things I need to do tomorrow morning.  I'm getting so caught up in everything that I forgot to do a few things I had scheduled to do this afternoon.  I went to run tonight at the gym.  There was a sign stating there was no hot water after 5:30 PM.  I thought, "What is it with my luck today?"  I ran for thirty minutes on the treadmill at various speeds.  (I'm always trying my best to keep my metabolism confused.)  Kylie set the pace.  Afterwards, I discovered that there was hot water and took a shower.  It felt good to be clean.  I always ran into a former UNICARE employee, Danny.  Jeff grilled steaks and I steamed brocolli.  I paid bills.  I ordered new checks.  I chose a dolphin motif.  I also discovered that my left wrist is fatter than my right wrist.  Go figure!

       WHERE, OH WHERE, HAS THE WEEKEND GONE?   Wow!  I got up today and read the paper.  I picked up my friend, Jason, and went to church.  Of course, Reverend John was not there.  Our guest speaker, Master Chen, spoke about the similarities between Christiananity and the Tao, which is pronounced "dao."  Afterwards, Jason questioned the significance of Wall Street to Christiananity in general.  Sigh....  I rushed home and Robert and I went out to visit realtors in open houses.  We had a very nice time and met some great realtors.  Robert made a dramatic announcement in the car that we are not following up on leads as we should.  Duh!  I've been talking about this for several weeks.  At least we're on the same page now.  I ironed while watching "The Simpsons" tonight.  It is the longest running show on television.  Homer went to the gay part of Springfield and lived with two guys.  It was very funny.  Well, I must go now.  I have to rise at six for a networking breakfast.  Check out the new links for Obscene Interiors and Star Wars: Designers Edition.

       YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY I'VE GOT PORK IN MY TUMMY   Last night we went to dinner with Bart & Tim at the Heaping Bowl in East Atlanta.  I have further explored my fascination with chicken salad.  Prior to dinner, we took a "sticky b" through Traders and I enjoyed one of my favorite retail past times... smelling handmade soaps.  How do you make a soap smell like sex?  I didn't chance it.  I skipped it and went on to pink lemonade.  I enjoyed the "Joy" candle as well.  I never knew what joy smelled like.  Unfortunately, they were out of the "Teen Spirit" candle.  I would have liked to have smelled that one.  Today I woke up early.  I did things around the house.  I had lunch with David.  I went to CompUSA to return the fire wire card that I did not actually need.  I came home and cleaned the bathrooms, vacuumed, swept, did laundry, etc.  I sat down to read on the couch with my favorite pillow, and old comforter and Buddy, the wonder cat.  It was nice.  I had candles lit and one of the many Buddha Bar CD's on.  Jeff went antiquing today and met Jay Baker, Jim & Tammy's son.  He has body piercings and tatoos and has a ministry in Little Five Points.  Jeff has always been very interested in him and I bought him Jay's book to take on his missionary trip to Honduras.  Jeff may go check out his ministry.  We went and had barbecue near the airport.  It was very tasty.  Jeff's best friend, also Jeff,  is in London, Ontario with his dad.  Mr. H is in the hospital trying to gain his strength back to renew chemotherapy.   Keep him in your prayers.   I had a dream once where an angel came to me and said that worry was like growing thick vines and weeds around us and prevents God's angels bringing our good to us.  He said that faith affirmation clear the way to God's light.  I hope that's true.  I remember that every time I start to worry.

       MATRIX RESOLUTIONS   Well, Jeff and I went with Reid to see "Matrix Revolutions tonight.  We had a great time.  It's always good to catch up with Reid because he lives in Fayetteville.  You have to drive through 14 billion stop lights to get to Fayetteville.  Reid loves the Matrix.  They actually filmed one of the scenes in a park in Sydney near Circular Quay.  Reid, Jeff and I were there almost two years ago to this day.  It made me miss my beloved Australia.  I want to live in Sydney so badly.  Sigh.... We also spent some time wondering what our fourth traveller, Laura, is doing now.  The movie was very good too.  I got stuck in traffic so I met Jeff and Reid at Phipps Plaza.  I bought the tickets and browsed through a book about Bond Girls.  One day I want to write a song entitled "Bond Girl Burial Ground."  (My world, welcome to it!)  When they showed up, we went upstairs to eat.  I had a salad, a slice of stuffed pizza and a frosty Dr. Pepper, which was created in Waco, Texas where I grew up.  It was so-so. Then I bought an ice cream sandwich made with Nestle Toll House cookies.  It was better in theory.  It didn't taste bad, but after I was through, it wasn't really worth the fat grams and carbs.  I also realized this evening that I bought Reid a birthday card and I have no idea what I did with it.  I'll have to dowse in the house for it later this weekend.  By the way, Reid is looking for an IT job.  If you have any leads for him, let me know.  This morning, Robert, Deborah and I went to the Georgia Real Estate Investors Association (GA REIA) Business Associate Orientation.  It was interesting.  We went to lunch and had so-so fish.  It rained a lot today... especially on me.  It was an interesting day work wise.  That's all I'll say for now.  Well, I'd better turn in.  I've been gone all day and it's late.  If you could be any ice cream treat, what would you be and why?  I think I would be a chocolate-vaniall swirl Skinny Cow because I'm an interesting mix of opposing forces.

       WHAT DAY IS IT?   Boy, this week seems to have gone by in a blur.  In fact, I don't even recollect the weekend.  Last night, Jeff and I went to vote at the high school around the corner from the house.  We only voted for one position.  I was voter #150, which sounds like a German espionage thriller.  Da-dah-dum!!!  Afterwards, we drove down to Morrow and visited Party City, Target and Wal-mart for Halloween stuff on clearance.  Party City doesn't put any Halloween stuff on clearance.  They probably send it back to their warehouse for next year.  I bought a Halloween Jell-o Jiggler at Target.  Next year, I'm going to make Jell-o shots.  We ate at Gecko Grill, which was okay.  I had trouble sleeping last night.  I'm not sure why.  Today, I went with Jeff to have dinner at St. Paul's Methodist, which is where they filmed some of the scenes from "The Fighting Temptations."  It was a lot of food.  Afterwards I sat in on his class that he was teaching.  He was a little down that the TV was too old to plug the DVD player into.  He was going to show a scene from "Finding Nemo" that corresponding to what he was teaching regarding Christians and money.  Afterwards, I came home and typed up the "Gospel Truth" scene from "Good Evening" by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore that Joan and I are going to perform for the Christmas show at church.  I'm really excited.  I think we'll have fun.  I sent her the script.  She could use a laught right now.  Fred, her cat, is not feeling well.  My friend, Jason, came by to borrow my Robbie Williams CD's.  Afterwards, Jeff showed me the slides from his fishing trip.    I won "The Hit Factory - The Best Of Stock Aitken Waterman" CD off of eBay.  I have volumes two through four.  I have been looking for this CD for about 16 years.  I am so excited because it has some songs I've never had before.  It also reminds me of Kent, my best friend who was killed a few years ago.  Gee whiz, I have a lot to do.  I'd better get to bed.  I'm sending everyone good vibrations!

       In PRAISE OF INTEREST ONLY LOANS   I had a busy weekend.  Halloween was Friday night.  Jeff got early and went to Target to buy Halloween decorations on clearance on Saturday, but there really wasn't much.  I bought a ghost oven mitt that I will incorporate into next year's ghost story.  I have decided he will be my assistant, Boo.  I went to church to decorate.  I left and got stuck in traffic and was late to my hair cut appointment.  It sort of freaked me out.  I hate being late to appointments because then you put everyone else behind yourself behind.  Luckily, Randy got back on track.  I came home afterwards and didn't feel real well.  I tried to take a nap, but couldn't really fall asleep.  I did laundry.  I watched an episode of "Coupling."  Jeff and I went to Mark's for movie night.  We had some pad thai with a Sprite and I felt a bit better.  We watched "Sordid Lives."  It was interesting because it truly captured most of my extended family.  It's a Texas tragedy about a woman who was having an affair with her daughter's best friend's husband.  She trips on his wooden legs on the way to the bathroom of the motel room and kills herself when her head hits the sink.  Meanwhile, her sister, Sissy, is trying to quit smoking.  The son is locked up in a mental institution because he thinks he is Tammy Wynette.  Olivia Newton-John plays a lesbian country 'n' western singer.  It was good fun.  I stayed home from church on Sunday.  I still wasn't feeling well.  I cleaned the house and we prepared for movie night.  It was hard to get into it.  We really didn't have a movie to watch.  Jeff showed "Hear My Song," which I really didn't care much for the first time I saw it.  Dinner was good though.  The night was over and I felt like I didn't really do much this weekend that I wanted to do.  One day I will write.  Today I worked from home.  I was waiting for Robert to show up.  I organized our realtor strategy and read up on programs from our primary lender.  I got a lot done.  I finally understand why an interest only Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) makes more sense than a fixed rate loan.  The jist of it is basically because if you pay any amount over the interest only payment on the ARM, you lower your principle balanced owed.  Therefore, your interest only payment decreases each time.  Using the example of a $100,000 loan at 5.75% fixed for 30 years, after five years you have paid $27,776 in interest, $7,237 in principle and have a remaining balance of $92,762.  This because the fixed rate loan is amortized over 30 years and the first ten years 85% of what you pay goes toward interest.  However, if you choose an interest only ARM that is fixed at 4.875% for the first five years and pay the same payment as the 30-year fixed loan at 5.75%, you have paid only $22,635 in interest, $12,020 in principle and your remaining principle owed is only $87,979.  That is a difference of almost $5,000.  Plus, you only have to make an interest only payment.  If you have car trouble, you can pay interest only and use the money you would have paid toward prinicple to pay for the repairs.    Robert never showed up at my house to work today.  I couldn't reach him on his cell phone.  I think he must be having a hard time with the divorce.  He went to see April, his ex-wife, this past weekend.  Instead of getting upset, I got quiet and meditated on the matter.  I have decided that it's time that I take more control of our team for the time being.  Tomorrow, we will fowollow up with our realtor friends and try to get some new loans.    I received the new Sophie Ellis-Bextor CD today.  It's great.  It reminds me of old Human League.  This evening, I did power yoga upstairs.  It's challenging at times.  I like to do yoga at dusk.  You suddenly realize you are completely in the dark except for the light of the television.  The darkenss just seems to swallow up the room and the parts of your body that are not necessary at the moment.  You focus on the part of your body that you are stretching and strengthening.  You notice how perfectly shaped it is.  You become aware of the fact that the pose is not important, only maintaining your breathing and peace of mind is important.  The last pose is the corpse, where you just lay there, breathe and let your mind relax.  I always wake up and crave a cigarette.

       I HAVE TO THANK RUBY WAX!   Having said that, I'll  move on.  I finally met with my client today and got his paperwork started.  I delivered the neighborhood calendars all over the place.  I got a hair cut.  I've written Christmas cards.  I ironed.  There are presents to be wrapped.  I'm feeling like I just want to come home tomorrow and goof off.  I did receive a lead today. Hopefully, I will be able to help this lady.  I'm going to read a bit and then go to bed.

       HEIGHT?  I AM ACTUAL SIZE.   Okay!  I registered on a Web site a while back that has changed from a various features resource to an on-line match making service.  Therefore, I receive e-mails frome time to time with my closest matches.  I find this interesting since my relationship status is checked "committed relationship."  None the less, I find myself oddly drawn to reading the profiles of the various bachelors who come through my In Box.  I've always been interested in other people.  There are no nude pictures and the informations is most certainly tame.  However, I enjoy finding the inconsistencies of how these individuals describe themselves and their goals in words.  For example, if looks are of low importance, why would you state that you're only interested in meeting attractive, athletic guys with big muscles?  Some of the answers are chosen from a drop-down menu.  I'm partial to "only on religious holidays" and "not a pet person."  I guess that I should go to the Web site and unsubscribe or whatever I need to do, but that just seems like more effort than I want to exert.  Well the desktop computer is set to go to the shop any day now.  I'm not sure what happened, but my PC did not like the new optical mouse that I plugged in and now I can't even boot up in Safe Mode.  Go figure!  I've been using the laptop, but my Internet connection has been giving me problems.  I haven't been able to sign on for several days in a row.  I haven't always had a moment to call in and work with tech support for an hour to resolve the problem each time either.  Therefore, this would explain why I have not blogged much lately.  Jeff and I have also been very busy with our commitments.  Our December calendar looks much like a waffle covered in syrup.  There are always two or three squares that are empty and maple-free.  These are our free days.  Sigh....  We chose the Christmas tree on Friday.  I finally caught on to the secret this year.  We wander through the fir tree forest in the farmer's market.  Jeff will ask, "What do you think of this one?"  I reply, "It looks good!"  He will walk around the tree, examining it with the careful eye of a NASA space shuttle scientist and then move on to another tree.  Eventually, he will connect with one tree on a level he has never experienced with any other tree before and the sale is complete.  This year's tantebaum pimp was rather banal compared to the dwarf with the African-American wife from last year.  They were just really nice, helpful and full of personality.  We laughed and laughed.  I miss them.  Saturday, we got up.  I cleaned the house while Jeff decorated the outside of the house.  We went and sold calendars at the Artist Market during the Candlelight Tour of Homes.  Afterwards, we went to a Christmas party at Paul's condo.  I had four martinis and was enjoying my Santa hat!  If my memory serves me correct, the cheese dip was quite remarkable.  Sunday, Jeff's parents picked me up and we went to the Can-ta-duh (cantada)!  Jeff sang very well.  We were proud of him.  Afterwards, we had friend chicken from Mrs. Wiener's.  (You never see the Queen eating fried chicken.  Why is that?)  I went to visit realtors.  Jeff and his mom decorated the Christmas tree while dad supervised from the sofa.  When I returned, Jeff and I went to a Christmas party at his interior decorator's house.  (This is a sentence I never thought I would write in my life time.)  I sold calendars again while Jeff went on the home tour with our friend, Tim.  After selling calendars in sub-zero temperatures, Jeff and Tim returned.  We went to the Earl for the best hamburger in Atlanta.  Jeff tried to lure me down the stony path with onion rings, but I resisted.  Today, we went to work... separately.  Jeff went to his small business administration class.  He's so excited about his book store.   I finished most of my Christmas shopping and purchased my ticket for my flight home for the holidays.  Now I will address Christmas cards.  Until next time, do whatever it is that you do between times.

       MAYBE THE MOON  I apologize for the delay in posting another entry.  The old mouse got persnickety and Jeff was complaining about it.  I bought a new mouse and it worked fine until I tried to reboot the next day.  I moved the laptop into "my office."  I finally got the DSL up and running.  It was just crazy trying to do all of this while preparing to go home to Texas for the holidays.  Work is going well.  Every day Robert and I move a little closer to our goals.  The seminar on "Scripting For Success" at PowerCore was very helpful.  I'm learning how to give my InfoMinute.  We meet with the man with the nine properties tomorrow.  My fingers are crossed that he will finally move ahead with it.  We currently have four loans in the pipeline, but this would be great at Christmas time.  It seems like I haven't been to church in forever and I sort of feel spiritually constipated.  I need to get back on track.  I still feel like God is trying to get me to write that book, but then I suffer from creative constipation.  Don't say I'm full of it!  The trip home was nice.  Joan and I made good time, but hit some traffic in East Texas.  We called and teased her nephew, Eric, while he was at work.  I asked him if he and his boyfriend had named each other's unmentionables yet.  He said they had not yet had the pleasure of doing so.  I told him that was good because it was a year two thing.  Joan and I swung by Holli's house and I met her partner, Keva.  She's very nice.  She is in the process of becoming a life coach.  We got into a conversation that we could have continued for hours.  We definitely had an intellectual/spiritual connection.  Joan had always said that we probably would.  I hate it when she's right.  (Go gloat woman!)  I had a good time with the family unit.  Thanksgiving was uneventful.  Dad drove us to my grandmother's house with the urgency of a race car on a highway full of nails.  You really need a velcro butt to ride with my father.  I'm not sure how he does it.  I don't think I could recreate it if I tried.    My grandmother is very short and her house is built to accomodate her.  I went to get a roll for my niece and hit my head on the vent hood of her stove.  There was an audible BOING and I began to ooze blood.  Ironically, my niece could not eat the roll because she thought I was going to die.  Later that night, we watched "Finding Nemo."  My father seemed to enjoy it in spite of the fact that Ellen Degenerate was in it.  (Actually, I guess she still is in it.)  This was followed by "Moulin Rouge."  This was not as popular.  My father got up to look at guns on eBay.  We were two-thirds through the movie when my mother asked if it was a musical.  Sigh....  so much for sharing.  I was supposed to go to Blaises's house that night, but I just felt too tired.  In fact, I didn't see any of my friends this trip.  For some reason, I just wanted to spend time with my family.  Friday, we drove to Dallas and went to CD Source, which is the best used CD store in the whole world... with the exception of Amoeba Music in San Francisco.  It was like Christmas and I picked up a few albums and singles at great prices.  Some of the artists I picked up were: Happy Mondays; Laura Branigan; Lightning Seeds; Cliff Richard; Sigue Sigue Sputnik; and Army of Lovers.  Yes, I know it's a strange mix.  We then took a break for lunch at PF Chang's at North Park Mall.  My mother loved lettuce wraps, albeit was very troubled that we should both order the same entree at a family-style restaurant.  Fortunately, she went for the almond cashew chicken regardless of mesmerizing powers of our server.  My father seemed to like his food.  He no longer made mention of eating dog once the food arrived.  He seemed satisfied.  This was followed by a trip to Half Price Books.  This is the flagship store, which is as big as Sam's Club.  It has the Black Forrest Cafe, a massage therapist, reading rooms, books, videos, records, tapes, CD's, DVD's and other stuff.  Most importantly, it had a restroom since I was at the mercy of several glasses of mango-peach tea.  My father found the gun magazines and books.  My mother found a book on girl scout ceremonies.  Randi bought a book about the Beatles.  I found a book about Microsoft XP, which I hope will lead to a solution with the desktop.  I also found several books that I have been meaning to buy at a fraction of the price.  I'm really excited to read "Auntie Mame" and "Glamourpuss," which makes several references to Bananarama.  I also found "Origins of Marvel Super Heroes," which I had wanted as a child, but balked at the $6.95 cover price.  I happily bought it for $2.00.  Afterwards, we stopped at Target so Randi could buy a small metallic Christmas tree for her desk at work.  I bought the Brian Setzer Orchestra Swinging Christmas CD.  We went to BigLots! for the finale.  My dad bought two power drills that came with two batteries each.  We went to lunch with my sister, brother-in-law and niece on Saturday and visited their home.  My sister has an eye for decorating.  Mom and I played with my niece.  That girl loves jewelry!  Randi was going to a concert in Dallas that night and invited me along.  Although I was interested in meeting her friends, I was afraid she would be out too late since I was leaving to go home at 6am the next day.  Eariler that day, I had gone down to my dad's shop to find out what stuff I had down there.  I found a bunch of board games, which I brought back with me along with old posters.  There was even some stuff that I have inherited from various roommates along the way because I don't recognize it.  I found old pictures of my friends and me.  There were a few pics of Kent.  I smiled and missed him. I also found a postcard that he sent me on Spring Break 1986 when the school band went to Ireland.  I brought it home with me.  I was amazed at how I used to look like such a baby when I was twenty-five.  The road back went well.  Andi, Joan's best friend, rode back with us.  We listened to a lot of Heart, Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks.  I slept some.  We had lunch at Cracker Barrel.  We made good time until Alabama and then we hit monstrous traffic.  I got in and went straight to bed.  Yesterday, I worked from home and tried to reorient myself.  It was a strange day.  I thought I had lost my cell phone and wallet.  I finally found them on the mantle of the fireplace.  I was supposed to go to my writer's group meeting.  I guess since I have not been in many months, I should reconsider this.  I really wanted to go, but I haven't written anything new and I just wanted to stay home and read.  I'm reading Armistead Maupin's "Maybe The Moon."  It's about a little person and her life in Hollywood.  It's very funny and inspiring.  I love her fierce spirit.

       BOINK.COM HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME!   It's sad, but true.  I checked Dotster.com and discovered that www.boink.com has already been taken.  I cannot purchase this domain name, however, I can purchase www.boink.biz or www.boink.tv, which are both intriguing in themselves.  I know that the word "boink" is a silly yet cute way to say sexual intercourse, but I like to say it.  It's fun to say.  Boink!  Boink!  Boink!  It just makes me feel better.  2F's and I went to dinner with Reid tonight.  It was good to catch up.  He's changed jobs and met an interesting young lady.  He's going to keep us posted.  He was filling us in on how he met said young lady and mentioned it being a coincidence.  "Reid, there are no coincidences," I said.  To my surprise, he agreed.  As I mentioned previously, all my blogging has really stirred up my creative juices.  My mind is maelstrom of creative thought.  For example, the first line of a story or book is one of the most important.  It's what hooks the reader in continuing further.  Here's one that I came up with:   It was not every day that you met a debutaunte at the rifle range, and perhaps this is what drew Ted to Jill.  Some men chose not to look beneath the tafetta and the powder burns, but Ted saw a fragile vulnerability comingled with a firey independence that really cocked his pistol.   Mmm... I'll keep working on it.  It was a slow day at the cattle ranch.  We have had about seven leads this month.  Each month is more productive and lucrative.  It gave me time to work on a few things I had been putting off.  Joan sounds much better.  She's registered with several temp agencies.  The Georgia Equality Act called upon the GLBT community to show up in force at the state capitol due to the Georgia Marital Constitutional Amendment.  There was some concern that the numbers would be smaller since you have to dress coat and tie to enter the state capitol during the legistlative session, but the crowds showed up in designer force.  God said, "Let them be fabulous and they were and it was good."  2F's and I were discussing Log Cabin Republicans this evening, which is interesting since they are GLBT people supporting a political party that seems to be so anti-gay.  It's like being a vegetarean coyote.

       COME HITHER, KNAVE!   I apologize for not blogging more this week.  It has been a very unusual week.  In addition to Joan losing her job, a guy I sang with in a community choir went into a coma and died.  Meanwhile, someone I knew from 2F’s church died from brain cancer.  He had rectal cancer previously and I remember the first time I met him, the first thing he said to me was, “Hi.  I don’t have an asshole.”  It certainly leaves an indelible impression on someone.  Anyway, I know he’s no longer in pain.  Ironically, his brother died two days before he did.  It was just a weird week.  In other news, 2F’s and I drove up to Dawsonville, Georgia in the Miata.  We listened to No Doubt (brilliant cover), Fischerspooner and Sophie Ellis-Bextor on the way up to the premium outlets.  I actually caught 2F’s humming a Ellis-Bextor ditty in one of the shops.  We arrive fairly early and hit the stores.  For those of you who don’t know what an outlet mall is, it is a place where stores sell overstock, damaged or irregular merchandise or last year’s fashions.  It’s become very popular because now they build these huge super malls with nothing but outlet stuff.  It’s amazing.  My favorite stores are Timberland, Polo and Banana Republic.  I bought an import Rick Astley CD single for two bucks, a wool sweater for 17 dollars, two pairs of chinos, a cardigan and another pullover at Banana Republic for ten bucks.  We had a great time shopping.  I set all the kitchen timers in the housewares store and then walked out.  I’m sure they loved me five minutes later when they all went off at the same time.  2F’s and I joked around a lot and laughed.  He bought some stuff too.  In fact, he was the whole reason we went.  Oddly enough, we got everything into the Miata’s trunk, which is about two inches by two inches by two inches.  We arrived home just in time to freshen up and go to Mr. H’s 40th semi-surprise birthday party.  2F’s was afraid that he would miss the stripper.  I have to remember that this is all new for him… at 45.  We arrived and the house was full of people.  There was a time line of Mr. H around the dining room.  I learned that Mr. H was an only child and embraces the naturist lifestyle with a passion.  I was a bit chagrined to find a pic of Mr. H, myself and a few other guys I don’t remember in a hot tub together.  I had a flat top at the time and had a broad smile plastered across my face.  Therefore, my eyes looked really squinty.  2F’s took a great interest in who all the guys were in the hot tub with me.  I replied in a matter-of-fact tone that it was all before him and he had nothing to be concerned about.  I’ll have to remember to use that again because it worked.  It was true, but it may come in handy again some day.  Suddenly, we heard Amii Stewart singing  Knock On Wood  and there was some commotion in the kitchen.  We moved to the edge of the dining room and saw the stripper dancing about Mr. H in a kitchen chair.  I was a bit concerned because I had been told in the strictest confidence several days earlier that he would be performing to the extended version of  Physical  by Olivia Newton-John.  Oh well, the show must go on.  I wouldn’t necessarily have called it stripping.  It was more like the stripper was jumping about a bit and then suddenly he tore his clothes off.  There was no tease or working the crowd.  It was more like, “Hello, these are my reproductive bits.  Let me jiggle them about in your face for a sec.”  Of course, the greatest fear for any stripper did occur during his presentation.  His G-string got caught on his construction boots as he was taking them off.  This just focused attention on the fact that he was wearing a bright teal G-string with camel construction boots.  I just don’t think it worked personally, but it was not my night to judge.  If I had my druthers about it, I would have dressed him in a smart matching ensemble with matching hot pants, vest and booties like in Bananarama’s  Love In The First Degree  video.  If pressed, I could have edged the outfit with some contrasting piping, but that is as far as I’m willing to go. Anyway, everything was off and Julian, that was the stripper’s name, just sort of gyrated his hips around while Mr. H grabbed his ass.  The question of whether or not Julian shaved his anus was quickly put to rest as I made a mental note not to shake Mr. H’s hand for the rest of the evening.  The stripper hugged everybody on his way out.  He was very loving.  I like that in a stripper.  I believe he was also from Chekoslavakia.  When I had my nervous breakdown many years ago, I was given  You Can Heal Your Life  by Louise L. Hay to read.  Louise is religious science minister who teaches that our thoughts create our experiences in our lives.  If you affirm that bad things are going to happen, they will and vice versa.  She also believes that dis-ease manifests in different places in the body as a result of various emotional issues that we have.  She believes that we should focus on our body and affirm it is working in divine order.  I was given her  Heal Your Body  book some time later and each page is devoted to a different part of the body.  There is a brief run down on the various causes of the different ailments associated with it.  I stuck with it for a while, but I just couldn't look myself in the eye in the bathroom mirror and say, "I love my anus."  I mean I do, but I don't want to talk to it.  You know what I mean?  I had no idea that today's blog would be so anal.  Please forgive me.  At the party, we met Alan.  He was born in Scotland, moved to England and seems to have worked all over the world.  He works in advertising and just received a puppy.  Throughout the evening, he grabbed my ass a few times, told me I was hot and kissed me on the lips as I left.  I’m usually pretty debt at avoiding social kissing because it just comes across to me like a bunch of straight men staging a community version of Clare Booth Luce’s  The Women .  Alan just grabbed my head on both sides and planted one on my lips as if he were going to bonk me in the head with his own.  Fortunately, it was a dry kiss.  We may run into him again.  We also enjoyed talking with Steve.  He was just as interesting, but it’s been to long to remember details now.  I ran into Tim from my writers group.  Eric, the “straight model,” was the bartender for the evening.  He was very nice and did a great job.  He has the most adorable smile and personality.  He also has a body to die for and has been a fantastic motivation for my diet this week.  When we left, he was being fondled in the kitchen by the birthday boy and his partner.  All in all, I walked away feeling very good.  2F’s and I must have been told we were really hot about four or five times… by different people even.  Of course, we are hot guys, but you just don’t have people telling you that so much in one day.  That also reminds me.  2F’s kept noticing that guys were cruising me at the outlet mall.  I never notice.  When we arrived home, the festivities seemed to have had an effect on 2F’s.  Pan to a crackling fire in the fireplace.  The music swells as the image dissolves into fireworks exploding, etc., etc.  The next day, 2F's commented that he was surprised that he did not feel more uncomfortable with a stripper at the party.  I suggested that since it was all gay men, it probably didn't feel as uncomfortable than if it had been a mixed crowd.  He thought that might have something to do with it.  I also mentioned that he sure was anxious to go refill my drink all the time and see Eric up close.  2F's just smiled and I laughed.  I love that guy!  Sunday was spent taking care of my list of outstanding projects around the house.  I was in a cleaning frenzy.  I have a list of all the stuff that has to be done so that I can have more time to write.  After the funeral, Tim (non-writing one), 2F’s and I went to Mick’s for dinner.  I had meatloaf and ordered apple pie for dessert.  This is unusual because I don’t really like apple pie all that much, but I sometimes crave it.  The last time was in Alice Springs in the Outback.  Tim and I were going on low carb diets on Monday so this was our farewell meal.  It was good.  Our waiter was funny.  I thought he talked in a gay way, but 2F’s and Tim said it was a classic genteel accent that men from wealthy families used to speak with.  It was nice to listen to, but I still thought it sounded gay.  The waiter asked me if I wanted more water and I told him, “No, I’m moist enough.”  He almost spilled the whole pitcher on 2F’s.  I have to watch what I say because I know what I meant, but it comes out all wrong.  We had ice on the highways on Monday so the whole state shut down.  Fortunately, I was able to work from home.  After quitting time, I was back onto my projects.  I read a little bit of  Sex Toys Of The Gods  by Christian McLaughlin.  It’s pretty entertaining and has even more Bananarama and Shakespear’s Sister references than  Glamourpuss .  I was tired Tuesday so I just came home and read and fell asleep.  Wednesday I was on the phone with Earthlink most of the evening and they are finally sending me a new modem.  “Oh rapture!”  Then I fell asleep petting the cat.  Tonight I went to our Gotta Sell Party.  It was at a 5 million dollar mansion in Vinings.  Several mortgage brokers sponsored a party for real estate agents to come speak about the homes that they have got to sell and that are not moving.  It was interesting.  The gay realtor next to me kept looking at me.  After this past weekend, I thought to myself, “What’s up with this?  Do I have on my ‘Come Hither’ cologne?”  There was a strange little lady there who was very monochromatic in her clothes, shoes, make up, hair and glasses.  I am pretty sure her pubic hair was dyed the same color as well.  I drove one of the other guys from the office back to his car and I mentioned my partner.  He was sort of weird for a second so I guess he didn’t know I was gay.  He’ll get over it.  The weblog book says that as you continue to write on your blog, you begin to find your voice and have to express yourself or you’ll feel you’ll explode if you don’t.  My mind is going all the time now with story ideas and things that I want to share.  Saturday morning I woke up with a poem in my head.  I rushed down stairs to write it down before I forgot it.  I’m going to work on my personal Web site and post some of my poetry, short stories and screen plays.  It had been a long time since I wrote a poem.  I used to write them daily.  I’ll wrap up for now, but I want to direct your attention to  Not Enough Drew In The World  on the left side.  Drew worked a play this weekend and he posted some of his work on his blog.  I was very impressed.  It is very clever and witty and really nails home his point on the differences between social classes.  Please read it and send him some feedback.  I know he’d appreciate it.

       I THOUGHT I SAW A PIRATE'S FACE   It was a jam-packed weekend and went by far too quickly.  Joan is still reeling from her termination.  She said that she was working on her resume tonight.  This morning I looked out of the upstairs bathroom mirror and could have sworn I saw a pirate's face, but it was just a pattern of chipped paint on Phil's house next door.  The pirate looked modern, except with a patch over his eye.  Buddy went to sleep on the stairs and occasionally looked out the window.  She's never done that before.  2F's and I went shopping Saturday during the day and we went to a surprise birthday party that night.  The stripper was interesting.  I'll write more later.  I'm so tired that I'm falling asleep.

       CHEEBURGER, CHEEBURGER   What a difference a day makes.  Robert arrived early and we went to visit the realtor's office.  We took bagels and coffee and they were very well received.  We had a bit of time to get to know the realtors in the office on a personal level.  We received good feedback about our previous work and walked away with three leads.  After reaching the office, I received a phone call from another loan officer whom we will take over for from another realtor.  He had a deal that he could not do.  Unfortunately, we were unable to help the customer.  Then we received another lead from one of the realtors that morning.  Two of our limbo loans came through today.  I blinked my eyes and they came up cherries in a slot machine.  What a difference a day makes.  Joan was terminated from her position today.  She called me from her car.  She was crying and I felt horrible for her.  However, I couldn't help wonder if this was just the Universe giving her a push to move on to something else that she would enjoy.  I called my friend, Tim.  A friend of his that we had sung with in a community choir was in a drug-induced coma to prevent blood clots in his brain from expanding.  Robert, Dan and I had lunch at Cheeburger, Cheeburger.  I had a cheeburger, frings and a chocolate Dr. Pepper.  It was a naughty indulgence, but alas, it not be allowed next week.  When I arrived home, Joan had left a message.  Tim arrived and announced that Rodney has passed away.  Tim arrived home to discover that his roommate was moving out.  It would have been nice if he had mentioned it to Tim.    I talked with Joan again.  She's feeling very badly and blaming herself.  We talked about some things and I told her she may just need to vent tonight so that she'll feel somewhat better tomorrow. I told her to look over her resume tomorrow and go buy a business suit to interview in.  Sandra called.  She wanted to make sure that I heard about Joan and we discussed Joan's former evil supervisor.  It's interesting to look back to remember how I had trained this person at one time.  Sandra shared with me that she received some news about a family member that she has to deal with on the same day that this happened with Joan.  It was all very overwhelming.  We discussed how we might be able to help Joan get through this time.  If you could say a small prayer for everyone I mentioned, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'm going to bed now.  Hopefully, I will be able to say, "What a difference a day makes," tomorrow.

       "CERAMICS ARE DA BOMB!"   Continuing with my song title theme, today's header came from a Chris Isaak EP.  I like Chris.  He's got a great voice, a sense of humor and he's easy on the eyes.  I can even forgive him for  Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me .  I have a German compilation of his hits entitled Wicked Game.  I like it a lot.  I also like this song he sang on  Forever Blue  called  Graduation Day .  I like his old stuff a lot.  I'd like to own all of his CD's one day.  Thinking about Chris Isaak reminds of my friend, Summer.  She's an artist and was one of my instructors while I was in art school.  I learned more from her class than any other.  Afterwards, we would hang over Sunday lunches and have long conversations about all sorts of things.  We talked about music and I introduced her to Kylie's Impossible Princess album.  She painted a piece specifically for my house, which now hangs above my fire place in the living room.  You can check out her work at her  urlLink Web site .  Today was surreal.  It just seemed to float by.  Robert had another anxiety attack this morning.  I went into the office and had my meeting and then went to lunch with Karen.  The assistant pastor at her church resigned.  She didn't know why, but sent me an e-mail later with more information.  I don't know all the facts, but it has something to do with explicit images of him in sexual positions.  I sent a note back to Karen asking for clarification.  It sounds like he posed for a sex manual or an artist.    When Robert had not showed up by lunch time, I drove to his house.  We had a long talk.  We have some clients that are difficult to do anything with.  We finally found a solution for one and we're waiting on some documentation.  One will not provide any documentation.  Another one doesn't have enough money to do anything based upon her credit.  He just let it get to him.  He told me we didn't have any systems in place so I told him to write down what he felt we needed to do, when it needed to happen and who needed to do it.  We have a breakfast meeting with one of our realtors tomorrow.  I'm affirming that it will be the start of a successful and lucrative partnership.  Bonnie came in and shared some disturbing news to me.  She asked if I had known about this information and I admitted that I did not.  In fact, I questioned if the person involved had any idea of the news she shared with me.  I suppose they will talk.  I was reading an article on the BBC Web site about a toaster that does weather forecasts (see Eric's entry on his blog) and there was a link about a new aids vaccine.  It stated that 3/4 of gay and bisexual men had no idea that they were infected with HIV.  That number seems high to me, but it made me think of my conversation with Bonnie.  I came home and washed dishes and picked up around the house a bit.  I decided to spend some quality time with Buddy and jumped on the bed.  The new mattress and box spring is really comfortable.  I can see why "Princess" spends most of her time on it.  We were enjoying each other's company as I read Rebecca Blood's  The Weblog Handbook .  I bought this book over a year ago and have been trying to finish it.  It's become more interesting to read now that I have put a blog up.  She writes about how our writing styles change and evolve as we continue with our weblog.  I'm sure if I look back over my blog archives, I can see how my personality has developed online.  I wonder if I have shared too much personal information.  She states that there are three reasons why we keep weblogs: information sharing; reputation building; and personal expression.  She has an impressive weblog entitled   urlLink  Rebecca's Pocket   .  2F's came home after a hard days work.  I knew it had been a tough day.  He drank a Coca-Cola.  He changed clothes and then crawled onto the other side of the bed and took a nap as I read.  A few minutes later, I fell asleep as well.  We went over to Elaine's to pick up some books she's giving 2F's for his used book store.  Her cat sat on my coat and made my nose run.  2F's was concerned that I would bring some deadly cat virus home to Buddy and insisted that I wash my hands as soon as I stepped inside the house.  We had some chicken noodle soup and a grilled cheese for dinner.  I received an offer from GLBT (Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgendered) book club.  There are a lot of interesting gay writers out there these days.  I'm interested in reading the one about the man who wrote the  Star Trek  episode entitled  The Trouble With Tribbles .  He adopted a boy who believed he was a Martian.  In other words, plots have moved beyond getting off, coming out, suicide, aids, etc.  Now we have interesting stories about characters that happen to be GLBT and the details of their individual worlds.  I felt drowsy this afternoon.  My nap was enjoyable, but out of the ordinary.  I had plenty of sleep last night.  Perhaps there is something in the air and that contributed to my runny nose and watery eyes.  With the mercurial weather we have in the South, it tends to allow one to become sick with the switches from hot to cold.  I listened to  urlLink Sarah Brightman 's  Fly  album.  I think it was repackaged as  Time To Say Goodbye  in the U.S.  I admit that the cover art presents a different expectation for the listener.  It's an underrated album.  I worked a bit on a design for my personal Web site.  I'm also thinking of moving my blog to another domain so that I can do a bit more with it.  When we are at Elaine's house tonight, she was watching  CSI .  One of the stories was about a couple that killed their baby by leaving him in the car in the garage on a hot summer's day.  They gave the baby cough syrup to help him along.  They thought that he had some rare disease that their first born had died from in a slow, agonizing process.  Come to find out, the symptoms the second baby had were due to small quantities of pesticide that came from the mother.  I believe she was a professional gardener.  The baby was perfectly fine.  For some reason that really just stayed with me.  Ironically, the father was played by the actor in  Big Eden , which is a movie I mentioned in yesterday's blog.  Hmmm, say....

       YES SIR, I CAN BOOGIE!   I left my cell phone at work yesterday and I worked from home today.  Luckily, I was able to check my voice mail from the regular telephone.  However, the Cingular voice-response computer system is very hard of hearing.  I was yelling "Option 2!" into the phone and she still could not get it right.  (Bless her heart!)    I spoke with Earthlink today and was passed around three times and was finally told that they do not sell new modems.  I feel one of my scathing letters coming on.  (Bless their heart!)  We're taking breakfast to one of the local realtor's offices on Friday.  This is a good sign because realtors are like Nile crocodiles and mortgage brokers are like the little birds that pick the parasites between their teeth.  I treated myself to the new Sophie Ellis-Bextor CD single today.  I love  I Won't Change You .  I like the part where she sings that she will change her underwear if that's okay with you.  The video is cute too.  She looks good with burgundy hair and the  Ghost World  glasses.  The B-side is  Yes Sir, I Can Boogie  and it just makes me giggle like a Japanese house boy.  My mortgage intensive seminar was very good.  I learned a lot and received greate feedback.  I've been told there is an opening on a PowerCore team for me at last.  This is a local business networking group.  I've been waiting since September and this is a quick opening.  I heard that I was on the 14-year plan.  I went to my writer's group tonight and there were just two of us this evening.  Rick is about to buy a condo and is interested in me helping him with a mortgage.  (Isn't the Universe a funny thing?)  We discussed a spoken word event at the Red Light Cafe and publishing an anthology and doing a short story contest based on a specific topic or word.  I gave Rick a short story of mine to read and he read the only poem he ever wrote to me.  It was written after his lover of seven years was kiled in a car wreck.  I don't know a lot about rhyme and meter, but it was a lovely metaphor about the memory of his lover visiting him.  I stopped by David & Jason's house on the way home to drop a CD off that Jason wanted to borrow.  I finally saw an episode of Sex And The City.  I only saw a few minutes, but it was funny.  Jason made me watch the Mad TV parody of Me Against The Music.  It consisted of Madonna chasing Britney through the maze on a walker.  David indicated that that there will be a stripper from Swinging Richard's at Hillery's semi-surprise party on Saturday.  I'm not sure how 2F's will react to that.  Anytime we go to any place where two or more gay men are gathered, he acts as if he is visiting a speakeasy during prohibition.  "Cheese it, fellas!  It's the cops!"  Jason's straight (hmmm, we say....) model friend will be bartending.  I can't remember his face because most of the pictures I have seen of him are his naked butt.  Perhaps it's because he only designs women's clothes.  2F's and I still need to buy a gift.  Jason swears that Hillery wants a Madonna CD.  Me thinks he protestesth a little to much.  I think I'm going to share the Kylie story that Drew, star of Not Enought Drew In The World (See links to the left), told me about.  I would have told Jason before, but he would have told everyone else before the party so it would sound like I'm really unhip and behind the times.  All this from a man who once told me that Dannii Minogue was not Kylie's sister.  I had to break it down for him at the Christmas party... in front of the manger.  (Bless his incorrect heart!)  When I arrived home, Jeff was watching a news broadcast from Jordan.  The entire Middle East seems to only be concerned that President Bush did not mention anything about the Israel vs. Palestine situation.  Palestinions affectionately refer to Israelis as unholy Zionists.  It's almost as good as "evil doers" and "trash haven."  I've got a big day tomorrow, so I'll turn in now.  Remember: don't wear yellow lipstick.

       "THE MAN THAT GOT THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY" OR "FAGDAD CAFE"   It's been a quiet day.  The photo shoot went well for my brochure.  I was wearing a blue suit, the photographer threw a white cat at me and yelled, "Let the music lift you up, dahling!"  Tonight I took minutes at the GPNA meeting as the newly elected secretary.  Some of the people go on and on and on.  I know they feel passionate about it all, but get to the point... PLEASE!  2F's has entered a sweepstakes for a HIV medication to win $25,000 due to a entry card that fell out of the  Advocate  magazine that I received.  He was concerned about what his family would think, but I reminded him that his parents typically do not read periodicals that have advertisments for HIV meds.  By the way, General Wesley Clark is looking pretty hot on the cover.  He is wearing an open shirt with a white V-neck T-shirt underneath.    On our Saturday excursion, I was delighted to discover that Carrie "Princess Leia" Fisher has written a new novel entitled  The Bad Awful , which is about her husband leaving her for another man.  The header for today's entry consists of two chapter titles from the book.  She is also featured in this month's  Advocate .  I'm close to finishing  Kylie Confidential .  I'm on the edge of my seat as I enter the Madonna/Kyie comparisons.  Then I'll finish with the complete discography.  Robert made the decision that we should visit realtors more often.  I have been saying this for months.  My response was a simple, "Do you prefer to visit them on Thursday or Friday?"  Always give two choices and that way you're guaranteed to receive an answer that works.  We will visit realtors on Friday.  I've been very prolific this past week.  I'm going to bed early tonight.  Ciao!

       IF THE PET SHOP BOYS SAID IT, IT MUST BE TRUE   Today was Martin Luther King (MLK) Day in the U.S.  Even though Martin Luther King Junior’s birthday was last Thursday, it is observed on the following Monday.  Today was the first time in many years that I had to work today.  It was very slow.  I got a lot done today.  I drove by the MLK Memorial on my way home.  It's the short cut I usually take to avoid traffic.  For the first time, I actually had to stop and let some cross the street at the pedestrian crossing.  Robert returned from his vacation in Panama.  He had a great time and now has the international travel bug.  Perhaps there will be an article in  Rolling Stone  about people who purposely try to catch the travel bug and there will be a big controversy.  I clicked on the link for  urlLink Geek Slut  on  Belle De Jour  this evening.  It took me a minute to figure out he was a man.  I got him confused with  Pussy Ranch .  He wrote about having unprotected anal intercourse with an HIV+ guy.  I found that rather disturbing.  This guy is having sex with a lot of people.  Granted, he didn’t have anal intercourse with the HIV- boy.  He seems to only have anal intercourse with HIV+ men from what I could gather and he seems to be the top in these situations.  From what I have read, if two HIV+ people have unprotected sex, they run the risk of infecting themselves with several different strains of the virus.  However, you read about these men that believe that HIV was just been planted in our collective consciousness by the government and it really doesn’t exist.  Oddly enough, these men never seem to get sick.  What if they were right?  I know a few gay couples that have been together for a while and do not have an open relationship.  They have been tested and they no longer use condoms for intercourse.  I understand the logic, but since I came out after this dis-ease was already around, it’s just not an option that is available in my psyche.  It’s interesting to notice how much the world is changing.  I read another few pages in  Kylie Confidential  today.  Did you know she dated Pauly Shore?  They met on the set for  Bio-Dome .  She then spurned him for the French photographer, Stephane Sednaoui, who previously dated Bjork.  I would assume that both Bjork and Kylie were sexually active with Stephane.  Therefore, one could say that Bjork and Kylie have slept together… indirectly.  I decided to visit the  urlLink Pet Shop Boys  Web site today.  I wanted to know when they were going to release their next single from  Pop Art , which is their compilation of all of their top 20 hits.  There are two new songs:  Miracles ; and  Flamboyant .  I really like  Miracles  and the B-side,  We Are The Pet Shop Boys  is a lot of fun.  When I visit the PSB Web site, I enjoy reading the questions and answers section where fans have posted questions and the PSB type their replies.  It is usually quite entertaining.  What I have always liked about Neil Tennant is that he just says it like it T-I-S.  For example, 	question 58 reads as follows:  Do you like the french football? Do you know Bordeaux?  Neil Tennant: No but I've seen the French rugby players calendar. N  Then I came across a fireball of controversy and bad punctuation in question 884.  Please see below:  Do you think kylie should go back to pop.  Neil Tennant: Yes. N  Oh the scandal!  Personally, I believe Neil and Chris are still a tad bit upset about Kylie’s recording of the song  Falling , which they wrote for her  Kylie Minogue  album from 1994.  Once again, she was trying to be a serious artist.  Speaking of Ms. Minogue, her new single  Slow  has received a warm reception from U.S. radio.  Her new album,  Body Language , will be released on February 10th in the U.S.  It will include two new tracks:  Cruise Control ; and  You Make Me Feel , which was also included on the Japanese version of  Body Language .  It will also include the videos for  Slow  and  Can’t Get You Out Of My Head  from her  Money Can’t Buy  concert in London last November.    In other Kylie news, she will make a guest appearance on a future episode of  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy  and will also be featured on the soundtrack, which will coincidently be released on February 10th as well.  It will include the previously unreleased remix of  Slow  by the Chemical Brothers.  In addition, it will also include tracks by Basement Jaxx, Junior Senior, In-Grid, Fischerspooner & Billy Squier, Duran Duran, Liz Phair, Sting and Elton John.  For more information, visit the  urlLink  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy   official Web site.  Finally, the last topic in the Kylie Department is that Kylie is jealous of Dannii’s  Kath & Kim  oven mitts.  Evidently they both have the apron, but Dannii has one up on Kylie in the mitt department.  (Ooh… that sounds nasty, doesn’t it?)  Who are  Kath & Kim ?  They are an Australian sit-com on ABC TV in Australia.  Check out the  urlLink Kath & Kim  Web site.  It’s very entertaining.  I like the nip and tuck page where you can perform virtual plastic surgery.  2F’s had the day off today and was very productive upstairs in the master bedroom, a renovated attic space.  He bought a lamp made out of an old upright telephone and wove a lamp shade out of raffia.  He then put old black & white photographs of some people that he doesn’t know into the lamp shade along with an old skeleton key.  It’s pretty cool.  I’m very proud of him.  I told my mom that he was becoming a regular Martha Stewart.  She replied, “Yeah, but look what happened to her.  Tell him to be careful.”  We picked up my box spring today.  Abby, the store manager, has one of those great looks and voices.  I decided that she should be on a sit-com.  Buddy is somewhat concerned about the new mattress and box spring because it makes the top of the bed about a third higher than it was before.  It’s almost like a hospital bed.  She really needs something to get up on to make it to the top since she only has one hind leg.  I guess I’ll have to build her a box.  Tomorrow is the photo shoot for our brochure.  We’re going to have some individual head shots made so at least I’ll have something to use if I do decide to audition for a play this year.  Many people have been pushing for me to return to the stage.  I always enjoyed acting and did quite well, but it is certainly a time commitment.  I was telling Patty at the office that I had a screen test for  Primal Fear  and she was quite impressed.  I’m not sure that there was any reason to be considering that Edward Norton received the part and an Oscar nomination and all I got was a slice of pizza from the director.    While cleaning out my bedroom this evening to make room for the new mattress and box spring, I came across a book called  The Visual Encyclopedia of Natural Healing .  I opened the book up and it happened to be on the chapter on flatulence.  If you know me, you know this is one of my least favorite subject’s in the world.  In fact, I just think discussing bodily functions of the excretory system are just taboo.  However, I was surprised to learn that young to middle-aged men pass gas an average of 14 times per day, releasing a total of about 2.5 cups of fumes.  I couldn’t help but visualize some poor little woman in a white lab coat holding a measuring cup over some middle-aged man’s behind.  There is also a diagram of a yoga pose that will relax your rectum so that you can release trapped gas.  Yet the most shocking thing to learn above all is that practically everything you eat, with the exception of fiberglass insulation, causes flatulence.  Here is the list of guilty foods: apples; bagels; bananas; bread; brussels sprouts; cabbage; carrots; celery; citrus fruits; eggplant; lettuce; onions; pastries; potatoes; pretzels; prune juice; raisins; and wheat germ.  In addition, coffee, soft drinks, beer and other yeasty beverages produce similar results.  The best advice they give is to avoid these foods completely.  Well, what’s left?  Buddy just hopped over to the stairs and has meowed at me that it is time to go to bed.  I’d better wrap up or she’ll be down in a few minutes to check on me.  She’s really quite intelligent as well as being down-right bossy. The nickname of Princess is well deserved.  I’ve been under a heavy British influence lately and have decided to start using “whilst” as much as possible.  You don’t believe me?  Whilst he or whilstn’t he?  That is the question!  I received a pleasant surprise today.  Drew from London sent me a nice note.  It’s always nice to make a new friend… especially when he is a writer too.  I had asked him previously about his disparaging remark about Debbie Harry.  His response was as follows:  “Oh, and Debbie Harry – well don’t get me started.  She still owes me ten quid… ;)”    I’m intrigued.  Tell me more.

       THE MULTIPLE-ORGASMIC MAN   I've been busy for the past few days.  I worked late Friday and came home.  2F's and I ordered a pepperoni pizza and watched "Auntie Mame."  We both laughed really hard.  It was interesting to compare the book to the movie.  I had seen the movie years ago when I was fourteen and was in the play a year later.  I think the play/movie improved upon the book odly enough.    We got up late on Saturday.  2F's has been under the weather so I let him sleep while I read "Kylie Confidential."  It's a cheesey, tell-all book cashing in on Ms. Minogue's popularity.  It tells about how she seduced a football player when she was sixteen on a garage floor.  I did learn other things.  I had no idea that Dannii, her sister, was such a huge star before Kylie.  Interesting....  We went to the new Australian bakery that opened in East Atlanta.  The pavlova was better than the location in Marietta.  We went to the anitque mall across the street.  Hours later, we dropped off our recycling at the DeKalb Farmer's Market and went to another antique mall.  I had no idea that Lisa Lisa & The Cult Jam were considered antiques.  We heard a little boy say, "Look Mom, an old keyboard."  "No son, that's a typewriter."  We went to movie night.  We had dinner at Mu Lan's and I had crispy orange chicken, which was good, but not for the whole meal.  I ate a candle to break the sweet taste.  Afterwards, we watched "Beautiful Thing."  I had seen it before.  It's a very sweet movie.  It moved 2F's, but also made him very sad.  I also received this month's Out magazine yesterday and it was listed as the number one gay movie of all time.  Hmmm, we say....  Today was busy.  I went to Sunday school, church, the gym, GPNA meeting and then began organizing my bedroom while I did laundry.  I'm just finishing up ironing.  I found a copy of "The Multiple Orgasmic Male" in a box.  I think I'm going to set it on my night stand to see what kind of response I receive from people.  I wonder where it came from?

       JOAN HAS DECIDED TO RELEASE HER CELIBACY   It was a good day, today.  I woke up with ticking off in my head while in the shower all the things I had to do today.  It was a bit overwhelming, but then I decided that everything would sort itself out and it did.  The furnace man came and we now have heat upstairs.  Yeah!  I had that fantastic chicken club salad from Brookside Grill today.  It has nuts, dried cherries and golden raisins and this fantasic marinated chicken.  I had lunch with Dan today.  He's really in a good place now after making some big changes very suddenly.  I was speaking with some of the other loan specialists and they are experiencing the same slowness that I am right now.  We expect it to pick up in February.  Ironically, rates have dropped the lowest they have ever been.  A 5/6 Interest Only LIBOR ARM is at 4.25%.  Amazing!  The creative visualization meeting was at my house tonight.  We talked about all the goals that we set last year and had achieved before the end of the year.  I had fifteen.  I still have a list of things to do from last year, which I call unfinished business.  I hope to resolve those soon.  I set my new goals for this year.  We wrote down all the things we want do away with from our lives.  For example, negative qualities, old ideas, bad health, poverty, etc.  We burned those in the chimanera in the back yard.  It was very freeing.  I only wish it had not been so windy.  It was such a beautiful day today.  The sky was blue with no clouds and lots of sunshine.  It's supposed to get down in the 20's tonight.  Joan has decided that she wants to start dating again, have a relationship and begin "making nice nice" again.  It made antedelluvian images come to mind.  I've been feeling really deep today.  I've really gotten to this place in my life where I don't put a lot of expectations on anything... including myself.  I'm not referring to a feeling of hopelessness.  I'm just saying I plan to do things, but I'm very open-minded about how it will happen and what it will be like.  I'm much more relaxed and not disappointed with the outcome.  I think that's healthy.  I have a stack of books beside my bed that is a real hodge podge of topics.  Jeff bought me "The Story Of Pi."  Merredith bought me a book on Madonna and a friend gave me "Kylie Confidential," which is really cheesey looking.  I recently read Kylie's entire natal chart.  She worries a lot and now I have trouble sleeping at night.  Well, maybe not.  There is a book about Sydney and one about a little girl who wants to make pop-up greeting cards or become a dentist.  It's really very clever, but got slow in the middle.  There is a book on soap making, candle making and (I love this title) "You Can Write Greeting Cards."  There is also a book on hiking Georgia.  I haven't spen much time outdoors the past few months and I really need to get outside.  There is also "Sex Toys Of The Gods," which is by the author who wrote "Glamourpuss."  Work is really getting in the way of my life.  I sent an e-mail to Drew from the "Not Enough Drew In The World" blog and he sent me a very nice reply.  He explained that one quid is equal to one pound.  CV stands for Curriculum Vitae, which is the Latin equivalent for resume.  It's very interesting.  We speak the same language, but yet we don't.  I sent a reply back that was much longer than I had anticipated, but I just went with the flow.  It's like I tapped into some literary sugar high.  If only I had been working on my book.  Maybe I'll start writing in the morning.  All in all, Drew seems like a really nice and bright guy.  I've enjoyed reading his blog and you probably will too.  Check it out!  The link is on the left.  I had an interesting experience that was a result from the "Quest For Meaning" book that I have been reading.  The idea is that we can generate love for ourselves.  When I say love, I'm not speaking of sexual or romantic love, but an appreciation and respect for the miracle of life that we each are.  I had to do an exercise where I picked up a stuffed animal and imagined loving that stuffed animal to see whether the love I felt came from the stuffed animal or inside me.  I really thought this was stupid and I'm prett open-minded.  I wasn't even sure if I had a stuffed animal.  However, I committed to doing this so I went into my room.  I bought a stuffed kangaroo with an aviator cap and goggles when I was in Australia and it's on the top shelf of my book case, which is dedicated to my world travels.  I picked it up and hugged it.  After a moment, I really felt this intense love well up inside of me and begin to emenate out from my chest.  I felt as if I was almost about to purr.  It reminded me of when I pick up Buddy, much to her chargrin, and hold her.  For some reason, it was particularly moving for me and I'm still thinking about it several days later.  There are so many things I want to learn about and do.  I just don't understand how other people can be bored.  I haven't been bored since 1975.

       GET YOURSELF HIGH   I was under the spell of the Chemical Brothers today.  I tried to read Sophie Ellis-Bextor's lips this morning, but I just wasn't in the mood to take her home, get over myself or let music get the best of her.  I, too, know that it is murder on the dancefloor.  Okay.  That was all bad because most of you want understand the references to her first album and first four singles.  It was really a great day today until I came home and talked to Mike from Earthlink.  I'm not sure what's happened with their tech support department, but they are not as together as they used to be.  We once again had to test everything.  I asked him if this information wasn't already in the notes since I had already been through this with the five previous technicians.  He asked me which model modem I had and I asked him why it wasn't in the notes since they ask me every time.  Then he told me the problem must be on my end.  I said, "Hmmm... that's interesting.  When I take my laptop to work and plug in the ethernet connection at the office, it works great.  I've tried the modem with three brand new ethernet cables and nothing happens.  Bellsouth has checked the line twice and it's fine.  That leads me to believe it's the modem."  Then he tells me that my modem is no longer under warranty.  I remind him that I didn't buy the modem.  So Mike gives me my choices:  A. I buy a new modem from Earthlink for $50  B. I buy a refurbished modem from Earthlink for $40  C. I buy a new modem eslewhere, which may not be compatible with their software.  D. I sign a new 12-month contact with Earthlink and receive a free modem (and outstanding support and customer service.  E.  I cancel my account.  F. I take a lock of Mike's hair and some of his fingernail clippings to Ms. Hattie's Voodoo Is Us and....  I feel very betrayed.  I've had a relationship with Earthlink, formerly Mindspring for almost seven years.  It just frustrates me that I have been paying for DSL service and have not received that for the past two months and no one seems to give a damn.  I felt very angry and decided it was best not to make a decision at the moment.  Mike asked me what he should do with my trouble ticket.  I inhaled slowly and replied, "You know what to do with it, Mike.  Goodbye."  On the brighter side, I did have lunch with my friend, Donald.  I met Donald at art school, which sounds so hip, doesn't it?  We met in Art History class.  Donald always wore sandals, which was a big step for me because I usually like to know my friends for a while before I see their feet.  Anyway, Donald and I would talk during breaks and in the parking lot after class.  It was fun making a new friend because I really didn't make any friends at school.  I was in my early 30's and already working in a successful job.  I wasn't angry.  I had no body piercings or tattoos.  I could compose a complete sentence without the "F" word.  (I love to say it like that.  It's so dramatic!)  Plus, I spent most of my time with Jeff and I sort of realized that I needed to branch out and spend time with some other people too.  I don't remember when Donald and I spent time together outside of class, but I think it was at my surprise birthday party that I threw for myself in 2000.  The surprise was that I didn't tell anyone it was my birthday.  Donald brought his girlfriend, Julie, over the house and we drank a little, snacked a little and Julie showed us how she did swallow tests on elderly people in nursing homes.  She has a little tube she sticks up their nostril holes.  We had a great time.  Over the years, we've spent some time together and the two of them are absolutely two of my most favorite people in the world.  This year, Jeffifer met Julie's sister who works at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and stalks Duran Duran in her spare time.  I think she's fabulous!  Work was okay.  It seemed to take forever to do anything today.  The toilets are broken at the office.  You have to take the lid off and stick your hand down in the water to pull the chain to flush it.  Meanwhile you have to put the lamp in the sink because there is no overhead lighting.  Fortunately, we didn't eat finger foods today.  I went to church tonight and listened to a lecture on "treasure mapping."  It's sometimes referred to as visual prayer, which is basically cutting out pictures of things you want to manifest in your life.  For example, cutting your head out of a picture and pasting it on a picture of the body you would like to have.  It was interesting.  I didn't learn anything new, but I like to hear what other people have experienced and done.  I guess I an experience voyeur.    Because I was listening to the Chemical Brothers' Greatest Hits in the car, I kept singing:  "Hey girl! Hey boy! Superstar DJ's.... HERE WE GO!"  It's ironic considering that "Hey Boy, Hey Girl" isn't even included on the album.  Jeff is feeling sicker than yesterday.  He's achey, sore throat, sinus, etc. and deal with the legislative session.    Gov. Perdue (Sonny) gave his big address to the House tonight.  (It's normally given in the morning to address this year's proposed budget.)  I was pretty sure he was going to tell us that he wanted to propose legislation to send school teachers to the moon... and then, perhaps, on to Mars.  Instead, he addressed nothing really.  It was pretty much a campaign speech.  The main point seemed to be that he was not going to do away with the Hope scholarship, which takes the winnings from the lottery to fund free tuition for Georgia students to go to college.  I wish we had something like that when I went to school for my first degree in Texas.  Dubya gave a speech on the space program today.  I'm all for space exploration.  However, I think it's just a red herring to take the attention away from Iraq.  Didn't his father do the same thing in '89.  It's not really that interesting.  I wish he would sleep with an intern.  THAT would be interesting.  I'm still kicking myself for not picking up a copy of "Presidential Impeachment For Dummies" on the Borders' clearance rack several years ago.  The big buzz now is Bush coming to Atlanta tomorrow to put a wreath on the MLK Memorial, which is just down the street from me.  It's weird living near so much history.  A lot of African-American leaders feel it's just for show and in bad taste.  I don't know why.  I mean, Bush has been such a big supporter of civil rights since he's been in office.  I shouldn't write that way.  He is our leader and I should respect the office of the President.  I would like politicians better if it wasn't for all the politics.  Jeff and I watched some Tom & Jerry cartoons on Boomerang tonight.  That cat's just not very bright.  Instead of taking the corn cob away from Jerry and then trying to catch him, why not just grab him WITH the corn cob.  Go figure!  Okay... this superstar DJ is going to bed.  Tomorrow, the furnace man cometh.

       BONNIE WAS IN THE MOOD FOR MEXICAN TODAY   I don't know why I get such a kick out of my obscure headers.  I suppose that on a certain leel, I want readers to think, "I'm intrigued.  Tell me more."  And then I rant on about something completely different.  Today went by so fast.  I got up and had my morning meditation time.  I took Catherine Ponder's suggestion and said the Lord's Prayer 15 times on the way to work as a form of meditaton.  It really is a remarkable piece of information if you break it down piece by piece.  However, I did not win the lottery today.  One day I'll actually have to buy a ticket.  As stated above, Bonnie decided that we should have Mexican today for lunch.  I had the Especial No. 10... or was it the Speedy Gonzalez.  I can't remember.    I left early to meet the the furnace guy.  I stopped by the Cyclorama to speak with Mr. Jenkins.  I took a display with nine calendars (he already had one) to Mr. Jenkins and broke it down (Oh no, you didn't say that!) for him.  I finally convinced him to sell the 2004 "Postcards From The Park" calendars because he gets a dollar and the remaining nine goes to the neighborhood association.  Afterwards, I dropped a contract off at a local realtor's office and spoke with one of the realtors.  I'll call him George because that is how he was introduced to me.  George makes me laugh.  He calls me things like "sunshine," "doll," "honey," and "baby."  It's such a Southern thing.  The furnace guy did not show up.  Evidently he wrote down the wrong number.  I left a message for him and waited for a call back.  In the interim, I read the archives on Belle De Jour.  She never writes anything too long.  I like that.  Lately, I've been writing novels.  I'm okay with that.  It is what it is.  Furnace guy calls back.  He'll come by on Thursday morning.  I decide to drive over to East Atlanta and have my tires repaired at Rubber Man.  It was fun to stand around and watch.  African-American culture is so interesting to me.  It was interesting watching the dynamics amongst the workers.  They did a good job and were very friendly to me.  Sometimes you meet African-American people who immediatley decide they don't like you because you're caucasian.  Likewise, some Caucasion people immediately decide they don't like African-American people because they are black.  Will we ever grow out of this?    While watching the guy take my wheels off the Miata, I gazed longingly at the floor jack.  My father has a faded red two-ton floor jack.  He's had it for as long as I can remember and uses it to jack up cars that he works on.  (My father does body work as a hobby.  He does beautiful work.)  I used to jack it up and stand on it as I twised the disc on the end of the handle and I would be lowered slowly down.  If anything ever happened to my father, I think I would want the floor jack to remember him by.  A year or so ago, Jeff and I asked each other what one item we would want from the other's belongings to remember him by if something happened to us.  We both said alarm clocks.  I used to have a Fossil antique-style alarm clock.  I bought it at the outlet mall in Dawsonville and it never would keep time.  It remained on my night stand because it looked good.  Jeff always thought this was hillarious.  He used to have a tiny travel alarm clock that he would use when traveled.  The cover broke off and he would even set it even at home when he set his clock radio.  It was always the last thing he would do before he went to sleep at night.  It always reminded me of him.  Ironically, both clocks are gone now.  I wonder what we would choose now if the question was put to us again.  We had the Historical Committee meeting here tonight.  Dinner was rather bland.  I made salmon, green beans (steamed) and brown rice.  I had a red-flavored Italian ice while I was cooking dinner.  (Don't tell Jeff!)  The meeting went well.  We may be moving in another direction.  I just don't want to take on any further volunteer projects.  I have quite enough.  I updated the article about the calendar on the neighborhood Web site.  Who would have thought I would end up like this with a Web design degree?  Afterwards, I wanted to unwind and read the archive on the Never Have Enough Drew blog.  I'm not really sure why I decided to read it all.  It's sort of sweet because he meets his boyfriend shortly after the blog begins and they fall in love and they are still in love.  He writes well, seems to posses intelligence and is quite witty at times.  He's a virgo too.  Some of the things he describes are things I have felt before.   I remember feeling like my friends had abandoned me and really missing them.  I believe he is originally from New Zealand, which is one place I would love to go after visiting Australia.  He used the word "squillion" and it just made me chuckle.  I also enjoyed the battle of wills regarding the new Kylie album.  I think I may actually send him an e-mail.  I keep feeling that I should, but have no idea why.  British/Aussie/Kiwi culture is so interesting because we speak the same language and yet have as much culture shock as someone from China.  I just want to say something British like "Bang on!"  I asked my friend, Carol, once if she knew the Pet Shop Boys.  She just looked at me blankly.  She's a few years my senior.  Tomorrow night is my check-in night with Blaise and I have not written anything solid to share.  He is my accountablility partner for my creative projects so I must put something together right now.  Avoi sports fans!

       FIX-A-FLAT IS AMAZING!   Where does the day go, friends?  I worked from home today.  It was nice and no distractions.  This afternoon, I decided to drive to the bank and post office.  I discovered that my left front tire was completely flat.  Sigh....  I drove the truck, deposited my paycheck, got some cash, mailed Jeff's broken martini glasses back to Mikasa.  The postal worker insisted on marking them fragile even though I told her they were broken.  I had to hand it to her for her dedication to her work and what she thought was best.  X came by this afternoon.  The current boy e-mailed him today to say that he was moving out.  It's been coming for awhile.  It's no surprise.  They were going to talk this evening.  Y is not a bad person.  He's had certain life experiences and has chosen one way to deal with them and isn't open to any other ideas on the matter.  Y deserves love, but he has to rearrange the insides and make room for it.  Meanwhile, back at the cattle ranch, X was a little bit suprised at how the news didn't upset him as much as he thought.  From what he said, it sounds as if it is dawning on him how much time and energy he put into this relationship.  It is sort of like drawing with your eyes closed.  You think you've drawn an exceptional horse and look up and you're in Pennsylvania.  Please keep them both in your thoughts.  I hope they can part amicably and maintain a friendship.  However, that may not be the right thing for the moment.  I'm officially adding  urlLink Belle De Jour  to my links.  She's way too interesting.  Today's entry was especially interesting.  She sort of reminds me of Tess Turbo from the "Bloom County" comic strip from the '80's.  I'm also adding another blog to the links by a guy from a writer in London.  The blog is  urlLink Not Enough Drew In The World.   Who knows?  I may even send Belle or Drew a message one of these days.  I e-mailed my friend, Scott, in Eugene, Oregon.  I was responding to a message from October 30th.  However, you have to understand that Scott and I write long messages back to each other.  His daughter, Sioban (named after Bananarama member, Siobhan Fahey), is beginning to exhibit "diva behavior."  Scott and I share a mutual love for our hacked Apex DVD players and Bananarama.  We're waiting with baited breathe for the new single/album to become available in February.  I haven't listened to the new  urlLink Kylie Minogue  album in several weeks.  I wonder if she can feel that all the way across the ocean.  I wonder if she is worried.  Is the fear so great, that she puts on a hooded cloak and goes to light the candles and incense at her altar.  She chants and I begin to move toward the "Body Language" CD, but at the last minute, I choose "Shoot From The Hip" by  urlLink Sophie Ellis-Bextor .  I read a little bit more of "Auntie Mame" last night.  It is really straying a great deal from the plot of the play.  However, considering that the play was based upon the book, I suppose that is not a valid complaint.  Although I cannot complain.  I'm enjoying the book.  I also see what a brilliant job they writers did adapting the play from the book.  It was very well done.  Buddy slept most of the day.  She appeared in the kitchen while I was washing dishes in hopes that chicken would magically appear in he bowl.  She went outside briefly.  She was unmoved by the vacuum cleaner today from which she generally runs as if it were a cat-eating beast.   While Jeff was on the computer this evening, I sat down to read a chapter in my "Quest For Meaning" book.  All of sudden her paw hit me straight in the head.  She has developed this little system for letting us know when she is in mood to be petted.  I was not amused.  Princess got over it quickly and was soon asleep by my side.  The Fix-A-Flat really did a nice job on my tire.  It filled it back up and it rides great.  I'm afraid to ask what is inside of that can.  I'm surprised no one has tried to sell it as a "penis enlarging" system.  Last night I read a story about the architect, Sir Christopher Wren.  He visited a work site and the laborers did not know who he was.  He asked the first laborer what he was doing and the man said, "I'm earning a shilling a day."  He asked a second laborer what he was doing and the man replied, "I'm working on a wall."  Sir Christpher asked a third laborer what he was doing and the man replied, "I'm helping Sir Christopher Wren build the greatest cathedral in the world."  That story really hit home for me.  I often times live in a very small world.  I have decided to expand my view of the world.  Joan was discussing what men find attractive on her blog,  urlLink Conversations With A Woman .  It reminded me of a discussion I had with my neighbors, Tony and Thom, a week ago.  We were coming back from a Cuban dinner in Virginia Highlands and the topic of young girls in low-cut jeans and mid-riff tops and navel piercings.  You do see a lot of young women that are ten or twenty pounds overweight dressing like this.  Yes, these styles of clothing to tend to accentuate the extra flesh overflowing over the jeans.  Who cares?  If they are comfortable dressing that way, let them.  It's a free country.  Express yourself!  Who says that someone has the right to censor our comfort or personal sense of style because we may not match their personal idea of beauty, sexy or aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  The same thing goes for overweight men in Speedo bikini swimsuits and thongs.  If they feel comfortable, who am I to take away the right to feel the sun, wind and/or sea on their skin.  They are not there to titillate me.  However, I may worry about their health as a result of their eating habits, diet, amount of exercise, etc., but I don't think I have a right to say what someone can or cannot wear.  Thom did make a point to say that sometimes people don't know how they look in  particular article of clothing.  Live and learn.  Okay kids... I'm heading to bed.

       WOULD YOU LKE TARTAR SAUCE WITH THAT "BIG FISH"?   Yes, Jeffifer went to see Tim Burton's "Big Fish" tonight and I can safely report that it is an excellent motion picture experience.   You'll laugh and you'll cry.  I found it amazing watch Ewen McGregor and Helena Bonham Carter playing a scene with Alabama accents.  Especially after all that fuss over casting Renee Z. in "Bridgette Jones' Diary," which I quite liked by the way.  We went to F.R.O.G.S.' Cantina for dinner beforehand and I had a tasty burritto in the the most unusual shape.  It was square like a large raviolli.  On the way back from the theater, 2F's was waxing on about how death has permeated his life as of late.  (Jeff H. from Canada lost his father a few months ago and Charles is in intensive care after brain surgery.  Please think a kind thought for them.)  He is still amazed at the number of people who get through most of their life without losing somone.  I told him that I first experienced death when my grandfather died when I was four years old.  He asked me to describe it and I was doing so when he became fixated on an eldergly blind woman trying to cross Monroe.  Jeff decided that we needed to go back and help the elderly blind woman, whom I personally thought was pretty damn butch, across the street.  I'm not sure what it would entail, but I always believe in following your soul. We circled around and stopped in the street.  As it turns out, our elderly blind lesbian was really an elderly blind man who didn't seem to understand that Jeff was trying to allow him to cross the street safely.  Finally, he did.  The true irony of the situation is that when Jeff turned around, there was actually no traffic and the little guy would have been able to cross without interruption if Jeff had just driven home.  Oh well....  While watching the movie tonight, it began to have a sentimental effect on 2F's.  I felt his hand reach out for mine.  There is an energy that I can feel when he wants both physical and emotional closeness.  It's a very soft feeling like a feather in the air.  It's very vulnerable and can be easily lost.  It reminds me of slowly becoming aware of the breeze blowing a wind chime at night while reading and then focusing on it as the sound grows stronger and stronger.  I didn't figure it would last.  When we arrived home, Jeff immediately returned his full attention to putting up all the Christmas decorations.  I've learned not to allow myself to be bothered by this.  I'm really involved in my writing and I enjoy having time to read.  In fact, I'm involved with "The Quest For Meaining: Livng A Life Of Purpose" for a class at church and "Autnie Mame" by Patrick Dennis.  The latter is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's so funny and clever and... even moving.  The book is somewhat different.  I think it makes her out to be more vulnerable.  I don't suppose it matters because Patrick Dennis was not a real person and the book was written by an advertising executive.  Saturday morning I finished laundry and focused on preparing for my Creative Visualization meeting on Thursday.  I also worked on my Master Mind Journal with goal setting.  It was a lot of work, but I really feel much more focused now.  I really want to acheive some things this year with my writing.  I'm beginning to feel more like it has something to do with my purpose, but perhaps not in the most obvious way that comes to mind.  A friend of mine suggested that I interview straight guys that he hires to shower and masturbate on video for his Web site.  I must admit I was intrigued and already formulating Barbara Waltersesque questions such as:  "If you could be any Little Debbie snack cake, what would you be and why?"  "Pickup or camaro?"  "Would you like to biggie size that?"  I've really been fascinated by the Human League again.  It comes and goes.  I'm especially into the older stuff again before the girls joined the band and they actually had a hit.  "Being Boiled" has been playing in my head.  "Listen to the voice of Buddha...."  I also pulled out some Texas CD's, OMD and Blondie.  I love the new Blondie single "Good Boys."  It's the perfect combination of dance and rock.  The early 80's were such a great time.  I wish I had been older and could have gone to the Stark Club in Dallas and watched Grace Jones snort coke with Rob Lowe.  Sigh....  I know that friends often read this Web site to keep track of me, but I wonder sometimes about people I don't know coming across this Web site.  I wonder how they find it and how similiar and different my life must be from theirs.  Would they decide that I fancy myself a swiss cake roll or more of a star crunch? I guess we'll never know.

       I'VE BEEN A BAAAAAAAD BOY   Belle Du Jour wrote about anal sex today, saying that it is the new black.  I enjoyed her reference to Charlotte Church.  I try to steer clear of mentioning Char's name around my mom because then she always sighs and says, "It's such a shame she let fame go to her her head and moved in with boy and talked ugly to her mother."  It's much like every time my mother hear's Anne Murray's name, she has to remind us that lesbians everywhere love her.  Anyway, Sue on  Talk Sex  was discussing anal sex with James from New Orleans.  I was quite surprised to find out that I have an involuntary sphincter.  Well... I guess we all do.  She also spoke with Yolanda in El Paso about her lack of personal lubrication after her complete hysterectomy and a lady in D.C. with a husband that likes to cross dress.  I still can't get over the girl in West Virginia whose boyfriend wanted her to take a stun gun to his testes.  OUCH!  Earthlink and I have come to some agreement about my DSL connection.  "Houston, we have a problem."  They are dispatching (I love to say that!) a Bellsouth technician out to the house to check the line tomorrow.  I've already lost my Internet connection three times since I began this blog entry.  Did you read about the mountain lines that attacked the two mountain bikers in California?  Wasn't that something?  It drug that girl off with her face in its mouth.  They found the guy's body hidden under plant debris.  The eerie thing is that the mountain was stalking the deputies that we're out looking for it.  Unfortunately for our feline fiend, a police helicopter tipped the deputies off and they shot him.  The mountain lion's friend ran away and was hit by a car and killed.  It sounds just like a bad TV movie with Yvette Mimeaux, doesn't it?  I supposed the publicity will cause other mountain lions to stealthly slip into public schools and attack teacher and students.  This is how it all begins.  I saw Cate Blanchett on Inside The Actor's Studio.  I love her.  She's brilliant... and from Australia, too!  Jeff announced that he was disappointed in me tonight.  (What?  "Again?" You ask!)  I ordered some Mikasa martini glasses for him as a Christmas present and they arrived broken.  He called and told me to fill out a return slip, which I did.  Well, somehow I was supposed to read his mind that I should wrap the box in a plain brown wrapper and send it back to Mikasa at my expense.  I though they would send a merchandise pick-up tag since they obviously let gorillas ship them.  I was very tempted to mention the fact that I'm still waiting for him to help me mount my bass-link back in my car since I've been waiting since... September.  However, that won't help anything.  It relates back to my revelation about Robert yesterday during my meditation.  (I never did share it, did I?)  The answer that came to me as clear as if someone whispered it in my ear is to suggest to Robert that he ask me to do things in the future instead of telling me.  Better yet, why not ask what I think we should do.  It should work like a charm without making him look bad.  I'm looking forward to a productive weekend at home.  We'll I'm off to bed.  Same Bat Time, same Bat Channel, kids!

       TODAY I HAD A VERY TASTY LUNCH   I woke up slowly this morning, feeling very toasty under my comforter with the space heater emitting a gentle hum.  I had gone to bed relatively early for me so that I when I finally ousted myself from the bed, it was almost eight.  I took care of my daily prayer and meditation business to get myself in a good place for the day.  A solution regarding the situation with Robert came through in meditation today.  More on that later.  I reviewed a file Robert had given me early this morning and made a few notes to ask him about when he called from Miami.  I explored my desk a bit and found lots of things that needed to be thrown away and lots of tasks for this weekend.  I expect this weekend will be a quiet work at home weekend.  Robert called when I was in the shower.  I had my cell phone just outside the curtain as I knew he would call when I was in the shower.  In the middle of the conversaton, my cell phone went dead.  I never renewed contact with him by phone, but sent him an e-mail later  Picked up a contract on the way to work and filled the Miata up with gasoline.  I stopped and got a Quizino sanwich... Tuscan Chicken I believe.  It was very tasty.  I got a lot done today and left by 5:30pm.  Traffic was dense downtown and I cut through the city.  I passed the new Barnes and Noble by Georgia Tech.  I imagined how nice it would be inside, drinking a cofee and reading a book in a soft easy chair while occasionally glancing outside to sit drivers fighting the traffic in the rain.  When I arrived home, Jeff was putting a brisket in the oven.  I changed into some sweats.  (I'm very in touch with my inner lesbian.)  I laid down with Buddy and slept for a few minutes.  We ate dinner and I washed dishes.  I read a little bit of "Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me & Other Trials From My Queer Life" by  urlLink Michael Thomas Ford .  I choked on spittle while reading the story about how he ran out of his bedroom because he thought the rapture had passed him by and freaked out the ladies in his mom's garden club.  I saw Jay on my way in the house this evening.  I asked him about Susan’s sonogram.  He said it will be a boy.  I was so sure it was going to be a girl.  I guess I’ll have to turn in my gypsy license.  Still… my intuition is almost always right.  I immediately decided she has a little faggot in the oven.  I turned around on the steps, looked at Jay and said, “Maybe he’ll be artistic.”  Jay just beamed and replied, “I hope so.”  People often ask me what it is like to have a relationship with someone with the same name.  You still just call them baby during sex so I don’t know that it makes much difference.  I have begun to take delight in referring to 2F’s and myself as JEFFFIFER.  I'm trying to get things ready for next week's Creative Visualization meeting.  A lot of stuff is on my desktop, which I'm taking into the shop Friday or Saturday.  I'll finish that when I'm through here.  I'm still having ISP problems.  Darryl Watkins, my friendly general technical support specialist, sent me some detailed instructions for purchasing a new ethernet cable.  This will be my third.  If it's not that, it's the modem.  I decided that if I worked as a friendly general technical support specialist, I would close all of my e-mails with "Lustfully Yours," or "Love & Hot Licks."

       TONIGHT THE KNIFE PIERCED THE APPLE!   It's very cold in Atlanta tonight.  This morning it was in the teens.  The meeting with my client went well.  He told Robert and I a story about his brother being electrocuted on top of a transit train in New Jersey.  He was working for the historic society, but he is really a graphic designer.  Hmmm?  He survived and spent a year in a burn unit and eventually married his nurse.  We went to work.  I allowed Robert to drive me nuts.  His words and actions seem to imply that I am working for him.  I do not take orders from him.  Occasionally, I'll do or say something to give him a subtle hint.  I need to say something to him when he returns from Panama, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.  One of the realtors we met on one of our Sunday visits to open houses has advised us that he would like to begin working exclusively with us.  I'm excited because I liked this realtor.  Our personalities are similar and he has a lot of the same work ethics.  It's more important to communicate, educate and be fair to the customer.  I worked late and left to see Valerie speak at church on prosperity.  Traffic was backed up and I soon realized that at the present rate of travel, I would arrive with less than half an hour left of the service.  I decided to drive on home.  Once home, Jeff and I had dinner and then he announced that tonight was the night to undecorate the house.  (I could have sworn he told me that was going to happen on Friday.)  I resigned myself to not have a nice relaxing evening of reading for a bit and going to bed early.  I put on Fisherspooner and we attacked the Christmas tree wth gusto.  Afterwards, we sliced into the chocolate/caramel covered apple from Neiman Marcus that Jeff bought me for Christmas.  It was very good chocolate and a sassy green apple.  (Grandma would have definitely slapped it in church.)  Jeff must have liked it because he asked, "Do you want some more?"  I said I was fine.  He asked, "Are you sure?"  We're waiting for a new part for the heater upstairs.  Jeff said he woke up last night because he felt like he had a heavy weight on his chest.  He opened his eyes and Buddy was curled up fast asleep on his chest.  She's an odd, but loveable kitty.  Blaise was true to our agreement on checking in with each other on Wednesday regarding our artistic endeavors.  I responded back.  It's cold again tonight.  I plugged in the space heater.  I think I'll go to the early service on Sunday and then pick up a Sunday paper on the way home.  I can read and do things around the house before my class Sunday night.  I need some time for me.

      THE SOUND OF THE CROWD  Today was a good day!  I got to work by 9:00am.  Robert leaves for Panama Thursday.  We have several prospects that are almost ready to submit.  I think Robert feels somewhat out of control about leaving because he has been very controlling in the office.  I have really fought the urge to break it down for him.  There is a reason why I am experiencing this and I'm working through it.  He bought me an ice cream cone this evening.  I think he really does value and appreciate me.  We are working together because we both have stuff to work through.  The Universe is so interactive.  Randy cut my hair tonight and we had such a good time comparing stories.  I just love him and his attitude and he is so good to me.  My hair looks fabulous!  Afterwards, I drove over to OutWrite, which is remarkably across the street.  I met with my writers group tonight.  I was a little uncertain about my story, but it was very well received.  Tim and Rick both liked the story and want to know what happens next.  There feedback was very helpful in pointing out areas I can improve the story.  It was a real eye-opener and I'm excited about revising the story now.  In fact, in some ways it is even helping me see my relationship from a new perspective.  Ironically, one of the paragraphs that I had thought about cutting from the story is the one that Tim wrote "genius" beside.  That was a very powerful moment for me.  In fact, the sections that I felt were rather maudlin and cliché were the ones that seemed to be the most effective.  It was a just real powerful experience for me.  I can’t wait to write some more.  I came home and arrived the same time as Jeff.  He looked really handsome in his turtleneck sweater.  We had scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese grits.  Mmm… a feast fit for lions.    My last Christmas present came in today, which was “The Very Best of the Human League” DVD.  I love the Human League.  It’s too bad their last single, “All I Ever Wanted,” wasn’t a hit.  It really should have been.  I passed a restaurant called “Me Me’s” today.  I wondered if I had been named MeMe whether I would have been self-absorbed.  If not, it probably would have seemed that way to French people.

       GOD BLESS EARTHLINK!   As many of you may know, I have had some serious issues with my DSL service with Earthlink.  While on the telephone with Tech Support, I have delved into the nether regions of my networking connections solve the mystery.  Alas, it has been to no avail.  They have assured me that Bellsouth has checked the line.  Therefore, it must be my computer.  However, my laptop has no problem connecting to the Internet at lightning speed at work.  It must be my ethernet cable.  However, after buying two new ethernet cables, the problem persists.  Now while checking my e-mail via the Web based mail center, my e-mail is mysteriously disappearing.  After checking to ensure that I had not somehow downloaded the e-mail to Outlook, which I had never opened, and checking the trash and spam folders, I sent an e-mail to Tech Support.  After eight hours, I received a cheeky response from Betty at Tech Support stating that I have most likely downloaded it to my mail program and check that out.  I sweetly replied to Betty and pointed out that if she had read my @#*% e-mail she would have realized that she was in error and should investigate further.  I may be moving to Bellsouth for my Internet service.  I feel better today.  Sunday was a sad evening.  Most of my time since I have returned has been tied up with doing stuff I have to do instead of what I wanted to do.  I didn't really get much done before returning to work.  No writing for the 1Fster.  I did see some friends, which was nice.  Last night, the 2Fster and I got into a discussion regarding our internal power struggle, which left me feeling hopeless.  It was one of those discussions that leaves everything you felt so sure about suddenly seeming as out-of-the-question as a sequel to "Ishtar."  Things are better today, but last night it just zapped all the energy out of me.  I listened to the Pet Shop Boys' (PSB) "Pop Art" CD this evening as I ironed.  It is quite festive.  It's all the top twenty hits.  I quite like the new single "Miracles" and the other new track "Flamboyant."  There is a different version of "Suburbia."  I believe it is the "Video Mix."  There is a third CD of the PSB's favorite remixes.  I haven't got to that one yet.  I'm also quite fond of the new Blondie hit "Good Boys."  There is a toe-tapping rap in the middle.  There is some lyric about me being all over your face.  (I'm not actually referring to me or you literally.  It's just the lyrics from the song.)  At first, I thought it was neon on your face, which I quite fancy.  (Hey, I have an affected British accent like Madonna!)  Jeff and I watched the new episode of "Absolutely Fabulous" tonight with Emma "Baby Spice" Bunton.  I think this is season is much funnier than the last season.  Jeff laughed hard in several spots.  My desk is next to a window that is uncovered.  Late at night, I sometimes feel that I'm being watched.  My first instinct is to look, but then I stop myself and I don't look in case it is a serial killer or aliens with designs on abducting me.  In spite of what any of you may think, I abhor the anal probe!  (No comments from Dr. Baker (AKA Snickers), please!)  I came back to a brand new work dilemna.  My purchase is set to tentatively close Friday.  However, the appraisal came in and the house is in bad shape.  The lender will never approve this loan.  We're going to have to change to a construction loan.  I couldn't get hold of any of my construction lenders this afternoon so I'll be scrambling tomorrow morning.   Tomorrow evening I will get a haircut.  Randy will work his magic and make me a new man.  Afterwards, I will walk across the street to OutWrite book store for my writer's meeting.  I guess I should write something,  huh?  I'm participating in the Master Mind program at church.  I was flipping through my 2004 journal and it looks quite helpful.  You know, I decided that my vegetarian paella tasted better as leftovers than it did on Saturday.  Perhaps it was the martini.

       HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM THE LOCH NESS MONSTER!   Happy New Year!  I know that I have not blogged in forever.  I'm still experiencing both computer and ISP problems.  I have taken steps to resolve those issues as soons as possible.  December flew by so fast that my head is still spinning.  It was one Christmas party after another and Christmas shopping.  I would have liked to have had some quieter moments in between the parties and shopping.  However, no one was diagnosed with terminal illness and Bananarama are recording a new album so there is still quite a few things to be thankful about.  Work is going very well.  We almost closed five loans this month, but on of my clients just couldn't get all of his documents together to close before the end of the month.  I suppose that is the way it was meant to be.  None the less, we are picking up speed each month and my boss is happy with our progress.  Robert and I attended a seminar by Dan Pinto shortly before the holidays.  It was sponsored by New Centurary Mortgage and Dan went over the systems that helped him become a successful loan originator.  Robert and I were impressed and we will be implementing these systems this month.  Robert will be in Costa Rica after Monday and will return the following week.  It will give me time to put together a few things for the following week so that we can hit the ground running.  I'm really excited!  I bought Palm Tungsten C PDA.  It has the QWERTY keyboard and I have loaded  my ACT! software on it.  (ACT! is a sales pipeline program that allows you to track telephone calls, appointments, things to do, contacts and sales opportunities.  I'm beginning to feel organized, which has been my biggest complaint since starting in the business.  The timing is right because I feel this new year is about regaining structure in my life.  I spent about eight days in Texas with my family and had a great time.  I have one of the best families in the world.  Granted, we have our dysfunctional elements, but we do love and support one another.  We ate all sorts of things that we should not have eaten, but it was just for the holidays.  In fact, I ordered my slim fins today so that I can get back into the swimming groove this month.  They are special swim fins that allow you to work all the muscles in your leg so that you burn more calories and gain more strength during your workout.  Christmas was very good. My sister, brother-in-law and niece joined my mom, dad and little sister Burleson for a lunch and then opened presents.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy what they received.  We're not a materialistic bunch at all, but this year we all seemed to be bang on!  I received much more than I anticipated.  I smiled and said thank you for all that I received.  I typically request CD's, books, DVD's, gift certificates, etc.  I prefer things that are small and can be packed easily for the plane back to Atlanta.  We're also a family that buys anthing that we need immediately.  Our lists are seldom practical.  I was also fortunate to spend time with all my friends this year.  Typically, I usually miss out on seeing someone because of the limited number of days and coordinating schedules.  I had a wonderful day with Duane and Maggie.  We went to Pai Wei, a fast-food version of PF Chang.  We visited some used book stores and then went back to their place to see my god childrend: a colony of sugar gliders (flying squirrels from New Zealand).  I met my friend, Steve, after work.  He works in retail so we met around 10:30pm.  We met a friend of his at the Village Station and then walked through Moby Dick's, JR's, etc.  I saw a lot of the same people that I used to see about eight years ago when I used to go out.  In fact, some of them were probably wearing the same clothes.  I also saw a few beautiful people that were no longer quite so beautiful.  I don't typically glow over another's misfortune, but it was nice to see that time had not been kind to someone that snubbed me many years ago.  I also ran into an ex that I seemed to still have an effect on.  It didn't end badly before.  It was more a matter of the style with which it was ended.  It was an abrupt end of contact with no closure.  There were no hard feelings.  I smiled as I walked by and walked on.    I saw Susan and Darla and we laughed about the past.  Darla is still trying to find help for her medical condition.  She received a prescripting for Paxil during an extremely stressful time in her life and the Paxil brought about tremors in her body that are uncontrollable... even after she quite taking the Paxil.  She has seen many doctors over the past few years and none have found a solution.  The tremors have improved somewhat, but not enough that would allow her to work or drive.  It's frustrating because Darla is such an independent person.  I saw my old drama teacher from high school.  I nick named her Mattie.  She is living in a cute house in Arlington with someone really special.  It's nice to see her happy.  We had not seen each other since 2001.  My best friend, Kent, was killed/murdered at that time.  I think on a succonscious level I did not want to see Mattie because it just reminded me of Kent.  This doesn't make a lot of sense considering that I saw Kent's boyfriend/widower, Blaise.  However, I had more history with Kent and Mattie than I did with Blaise.  Furthermore, if I was going to continue a friendship with Blaise, it required immediate action.  In the end, it just seemed like the right thing to do so I did it.  I saw Blaise the night before I left.  He's doing very well.  We seem to mirror each other a lot in the creative department.  He is composing music for a film-maker in Dallas and soaring to new heights in his personal developments.  We are both discovering ourselves artistically even though others discovered us in that area long ago.  It's like we are just now beginning to accept what others have told us for years.  We are going to follow up with each other every Wednesday.  I'm working on my writing... a page a week or more.  I finished "Way To Go Smith" by Bob Smith.  I enjoyed it.  I finished the last two Amisted Maupin novels, which were both quite good.  I read "Glamourpuss" by Christian McLaughlin.  I liked it so much that I bought it in hardbook when I found it in the used book store with Maggie and Duane.  I continue to be obsessed musically with Sophie Ellis-Bextor.  Her new single has a B-side called "Yes Sir, I Can Boogie," which intrigues me.  I'll keep you posted.  I received the Pet Shop Boys and Dead Or Alive greatest hits compilations for Christmas and have been listening to them.  I was catching up on my old e-mail this evening because things were just crazy in December.  I received an e-card from the Scotland Visitors Bureau.  It was quite festive and made me smile.    urlLink Check it out!

       I HAVE DISCOVERED MY INNER CHILD   Last night, I discovered my inner child.  I had a second piece of cake.  My inner child, Jeffrey, wanted it.  I call him Jeffrey because that what my mother always called me when I had severely embarrassed her with my behavior.  The first piece of cake was adequately-sized for people over the age of 30 who do not want their waistlines increasing in size like the borders of the ancient Roman Empire.  It was suitably  paper thin .  But no, Jeffrey wanted more.  And he cut a big ol' honkin' slice to boot.  All eyes were turned on me as I watched horrified as Jeffrey picked up the fork and shoved bite after bite of delicious cake into his mouth.  It was like watching a car wreck.  I try to keep Jeffrey under control.  Especially after the incident at my last job.  An older co-worker was always talking about being on a diet, yet she always seemed to be eating french, excuse me, freedom fries, cookies, candy bars, etc.  One day, she came up to me at the copy machine and said, "I think I've lost some weight."  She pulled her waistband out a bit to prove her point. Focusing on the complicated two-sided copy process, I did not realize the precarious hold I had on Jeffrey when he suddenly slipped away and said, "How do you know the elastic in your waistband didn't just give out?"  Kids... what do you do with them?

       I'M MY FAVORITE EXCAVATION   Something strange is going on.  I've become aware how essential my blog is to me.  I must blog on a daily basis.  It's like breathing, eating, sleeping and some might even say, excretion.  I've almost finished the Rebecca Blood book on Weblogs.  It's dry reading, but she has some interesting insights that have got me thinking.  I'm developing a better idea of who I am as an on-line identity and what I want to share.  As I begin to have more free time, I think I may move my blog from blogger and design my own Web site with the Web design degree that I have and never use.  I want to take it to the next level and review what links I have on my blog.  They are representation of who I am.  Do they really paint an accurate picture of who I am right now?  Why am I motivated to do this?  Is it the thrill of knowing that people are out there reading my most personal thoughts?  No, AC already told me that he just reads my comments anyway. ;)  No, my blog allows me to discover who I am and who I am becoming.  It's like excavating through the sands of who I am to find buried treasure.  Sometimes I'm not delighted at what I find, but I can recognize those things, make changes as necessary and let them go.  Sometimes, I take pride in discovering new or forgotten things about myself and clean them up and put them on a pedestal.  My writing is also improving.  I need to post some of my writing on here.  When I receive the camera, I'll add some of my photographs too.  My blog has become my own voyage of self-discovery.  What have you discovered through your own blogging?

       WHITE HOUSE DREAM   My fascination with other bloggers is really kickin' in.  I was visiting  urlLink BMW: The Ultimate Blogging Machine  this morning and enjoyed his post from 2/23/04.  I believe he is describing a dream.  You'll probably agree when you reach the end of the entry.  Here is the post:   So I'm at the White House in Washington D.C. and I'm walking around with my SpongeBob beach towel because I want President Bush to autograph it for me. I can't find him anywhere, but I recognize former Clinton Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers walking by me, so I say, "Hi Dee Dee." She looks at me thinking she knows me, but upon realizing that I'm just some tourist, she gives me a dirty look and keeps on walking. I catch up to her and tell her some lie about a child sick in the hospital with cancer that needs this SpongeBob towel signed by the president as his dying wish. She starts to take me seriously and tells me there is some big White House dinner this evening, and that she'll take the towel back to Bush to get it signed, but she wants me to wait in the Green Room. While I'm in the Green Room, I'm watching Tiger Woods being attended to by the makeup artist, when Paul Lynde and Kelsey Grammer walk by me. I see them look back at me and whisper to each other and Paul Lynde starts laughing hysterically.

       DEATH BY E-MAIL   I received an e-mail from my mother today.  My Aunt G, my mother's sister-in-law, died on February 20th.  It seemed like such strange news to receive by e-mail.  She was my favorite aunt growing up.  My sister and I would go over to spend the night and we would play Atari and watch cable and go shopping.  Over time, I learned that Aunt G did not get along with my grandparents or her husband's sisters. They tried to be polite, but there was tension.  Evidently my Uncle H married Aunt G because she was pregnant only to find out that she was infertile.  When my grandmother died, my uncle had a falling out with his two sisters and we never talked to Uncle H or Aunt G again.  My uncle believed that my grandmother had left a large sum of money and changed the locks on my grandmother's house and gave her jewelry to Aunt G.  My mom and Aunt B felt as if their brother had died.  Within ten years, Aunt B died too.  At one time, I lived within a mile of Uncle H and Aunt G when I was in college.  I never harbored any resentment against them, albeit I had been disappointed in the way my uncle had handled things.  Still, if he had not, I would have never heard my mother tell him that she would blow his balls off with a shotgun.  I think she was upset at the time.  My mother's e-mail was bitter.  It saddens me.  After all this time, she has never let that pain go.   She still carries a soft spot for her brother, but blamed all of his actions on Aunt G.  I believe he is guilty of complicity.  I wonder if she will contact him now?  I wonder what Aunt G and Uncle H did for these last 20 years.  I wonder how long it will take my mother to forgive my aunt and uncle?  Not for them, but for herself.

       EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ELLEN DEGENERES' BROTHER, VANCE   The other day I had a hankering to hear  Middle Of Nowhere  by House of Schock, which was the band fronted by Gina Schock, the drummer for the Go-Go's.  I decided to look for the CD on-line and got googly wit it.  I came across this Web site about  urlLink Ellen Degeneres' brother, Vance .  He's a really interesting guy.  He was in the band with Gina.  He appeared on national television in  Mr. Bill  on  Saturday Night Live  and was a correspondent on the  Daily Show .

       HOW TO DEAL WITH A BIPOLAR BOSS   When I worked for the insurance company, we had a director with no social skills.  It was not uncommon for him to just suddenly turn on you in front of clients, which was preferable to him speaking of how he conquered his sexual addiction.  (I will never look at a rest area in quite the same way.)  People never understood how I could just let him sudden attacks on me roll of my back.  Whenever he would blow up at me, I would simply imagine myself coming up the office late on a Saturday night/Sunday morning with my gym bag.  I would whistle as I walked to my cubicle, remove all my clothes, put on my in-line skates and rollerblade around the office naked.  Sometimes I would imagine myself with headphones, it depended on my mood.  The whole evening came to a delicious finale when I skated into the director's office and sat in his leather swivel chair... without a towel.  I would spin round and round and round until I finally came back to realty, smiled at him and walked off.  It always worked for me like a charm. ;)

       BONUS THOUGHT   I keep a lip balm in my medicine cabinet in the bathroom.  I usually apply it to my lips, which are really dry, after brushing my teeth.  I noticed for the first time that this lip balm has sunscreen.  The irony made me laugh so hard that I snorted.

       I'M HERE AND YET STRANGELY FAR AWAY....   It snowed last night.  I was up late tidying up the house for the appointment with M&A and the Creative Visualization meeting.  Shortly before dawn, I woke up and had the inexplicable need to go buy a loaf of bread and a gallon of milk.  I knew it had snowed.    I hit the ground running and barely paid much attention to the snow.  Fortunately, there wasn't much ice or sleet mixed in so driving was hazzard-free.  I went to my closing and had the most delightful time.  The seller was an older African-American woman, who seemed to have come from a well-to-do background.  She wore a snazzy hat and was delightful.  Her daughter was full of personallity.  We talked and laughed.  It has been such an intense past few days that I didn't even remember meeting Hilton at the realtor's office.  I knew he looked familiar, but the past few weeks, and especially last few days, have been a blur.  The attorney, Mark, did a fantastic job and you could tell that he and George have worked together before.  I think George was quite pleased with the outcome of the purchase.  He has been so supportive of us and I hope we can continue to work together.  I left the closing with a lift in my step.  I met 2F's for lunch at the Silver Skillet.  You actually write your order on the ticket and the server picks it up for you.  I had roast beef, green beans, fruit cocktail and dressing.  I also had a piece of cornbread.  It was not a low-carb moment, but it was good.  I like cornbread when it has a subtle sweetness to it.  I've been told that true southern cornbread is not sweet at all.  Taking southern sweet tea into consideration, you would think it would be the other way around.  During lunch I kept noticing 2F's freckles across his nose.  They aren't that noticable, but they give him such a boyish appearance at 44.  I hope that I look as good as he does at 40!  By the way, my customer who was denied last Friday is closing tomorrow.  The lender made it happen.  We had everything but the condo certification this afternoon and I called the company and finally had to "break it down" for them to get what I needed.  It finally arrived.  The package will go out from the lender to the attorney's office tomorrow morning.  I am so glad.  I'm not making a lot of money off this loan.  This is about helping someone get into a home.  Sure, there are some crazy things about his situation, but he pays his rent and he deserves to own his own home.  This should not have beent his hard, but it's done.  I got into this business because I wanted to feel like I was helping people again and I felt it today and it was good.  It just reinforces that we should never give up.  There is a definite feeling that has been some divine intervention in the events of this week.  I was wondering what Eureka was doing now and five minutes later she shows up and sits down in the seat in front of me.  I'm calling my client to say there is nothing we can do when the head of underwriting walks up and says that she may be able to make it work.  It's uncanny.  All this time I kept confirming that it would be in perfect order and it now is.  I met with my new clients tonight.  They are about my age.  As first time homebuyers, they are a little nervous, but they told me that they really felt comfortable working with me and that really trusted me.  That was very moving for me.  Ten years ago, I just wanted to be sexy.  Now, I just want people to trust me so I can help them.  What a paradigm shift!  The Creative Visualization meeting was a little unorganized tonight.  M&A were delayed a bit because they were signing some papers in George's office.  Joanne has made some incredible progress in the past month.  Her business is picking up at her current job and she has an interview with a new company.  Her freelance work is picking up and she's lost 30 pounds since last year.  She is our "Way To Go Woman" for the month of February!  As usual, Sandra has everything in perfect order.  She is truly an inspiration in discipline.  Joan still struggles with negative fallout from the termination, but I see and hear improvement.  I keep affirming that she has a wonderful new job that utilizes all of her talents and abilities in a fantastic location and earning a great income.  If you think of her through out the day, remember the vision I have for her and add to it.  My mind is very active tonight.  My emotions are caged animals that pace back and forth inside my heart.  There is something going on inside me that excites me and frightens me at the same time and I love it.  I know I could tell you what it is, but I choose not to.  I like a little mystery, a little intrigue if you please.  The feeling might peter out if I told you about it.  Ironically, it might just be the sugar crash from the cornbread this afternoon.  Truth be told, my secret may contribute a tad to this feeling, but I know it's not all of it.  I enjoy being a man of mystery.  I've become concerned with my enthusiasm in other blogs.  I've been clicking on various links I see on other blogs and reading the thoughts of new people in different places.  I came across a guy in Sydney, Australia that I have quite a bit in common with and sent him a note.  Maybe he will respond, maybe he won't.  I took a chance.  I've been commenting on Sometimes Happy a lot.  I'm sure Troy is thinking, "Who is this guy and why is he leaving all these comments?"  I would simply reply, "Because I felt like it."  He posts some interesting things that set off chain reactions in my head that spark something that I want to say.  One comment he made recently, it seemed that he was beating himself up for not putting into words something that he felt.  However, it didn't come out the way he wanted to say it.  Right now in this time of my life, blog means self-expression and I'm doing it.  "Ooh don't let me start 'spressin' myself!"  I want to know what other people think and feel. I'm fascinated with words and word choices.  I feel like I'm having tea with someone dangerous.  I wore a red button-down Polo shirt today.  George asked if it was my "power shirt."  I told him no.  "It's the clean and pressed shirt."  We laughed.

       I HAD THAT DREAM AGAIN LAST NIGHT   I have this reoccuring dream from time to time and I had it again last night.  It's like someone who works in your office building that you find attractive and you see on the elevator from time to time.  It always starts out on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  It's late evening and foggy.  There is a chill in the air, but it's not cold.  The street lights have golden globe halos around them that leave a bread crumb trail along the edge of the streets.  I follow them to a sidewalk cafe where an old Asian woman smiles at me from behind the counter.  The Hansel and Gretel metaphor is not lost on me, but I smile back and order a cup of coffee.  The paper cup warms my hand and the solidity of the mass of the cup and coffee sends a surge through every molecule in my body.  I feel strange, but in a good way.  It's as if a part of me is waking up from a long, deep sleep.  It's what I imagine it must feel like when your astral body leaves your physical body during astral projection.  I walk over to the railing of the pier.  I gingerly sipping my coffee so that I do not burn my tongue and live with the consequences for several hours.  When I hold the coffee close to my mouth, the aroma gently floats up my nose and soothes my olfactory muscles.  The heat causes cultivates a bit of condensation on the lower part of my face.  I do not know why I'm in San Francisco, but I'm comfortable being there.  I don't live there, but I do feel at home.  I don't know where I am staying or if I even know anyone in the city, but I feel comforted like a small child near his mother or father.  I just sip my coffee and listen to the ships and seagulls and the activity of the shops along the pier.  Although there seem to be no other people around, I'm not alarmed.  It's funny, but I think I just figured out the meaning of my dream.  Trust the flow of life and know that no matter what happens, you will always be taken care of.  The people you need to help you will always appear when the time is right.  I like this dream.

       BIC PENS ROCK!   I recently bought a ten pack of Bic pens at CVS.  I was inspired to make the purchase becaue they were on sale.  Granted, the 17 cents I saved did not amount to much unless I had a pack a day habit, but I still receive a great deal of satisfaction from a sales purchase.  I'm speaking of the pens with the clear, see-through bodys and the conical caps with a sliver of plastic on the end to keep it in your shirt pocket or between the cups of your bra.  (I knew this girl, you see... uh, never mind.)  I like these pens becaue they feel good in my hand.  They are light.  They run smoothly across the page.  They look great.  How many times have you seen someone writing with one of these fine writing utensils and thought to yourself, "My, now there is a good looking pen."  I am partial to blue.  I don't like black ink.  It's nothing racial.  I just like blue.  It goes with my eyes.  It's formal, but still casual.  Black ink is stark and heavy with the scent of bankers.  Blue ink is preferable when signing legal documents because you know immediately that it is an original document and not a copy.  I once had a Bic pen with green ink.  Green ink and I weren't as close back then, but we have grown more intimate over the years.  Sadly, I do not know where my green Bic pen has moved onto these days.  I hope he's doing well.  You do know that colors, letters and numbers have gender.  Black, blue and green are male colors.  They aren't macho colors raging with testosterone.  They just require an "el" in front of them while red, yellow, orange and white require a "la."  Bic pens bring back so many memories from public school.  Remember the excitement of receiving a brand new pen and wondering how long you could keep the cap before you lost it.  It was just like the Workers' Compensation board in the Target break room during college.  2 DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT.  Who can forget the thrill of finding out your Bic pen had leaked ink all over your backpack, or for the more mature set, your satchel.  Ah, memories....

       LET'S GET PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL, LET ME HEAR YOUR BODY TALK   I slept really well last night and sprung up out of bed like a 13-year-old's libido.  I drove to the office, met Robert and we went to meet Carol Lynn at some place we meet her for breakfast each month.  Things are going well.  We discussed some futher business directions.  We're on the right track.  She answered some questions we wanted to know about.  We visited another lender and we may be able to save the purchase that I have written about recently.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  Today was one of those days where I wished I worked alone.  I just felt like we were moving so slow.  I had a ton of stuff to do tonight and I left the office late.  I decided to go work out in spite of needing to do my taxes tonight.  Once inside the gym, I discovered that I had no CD for my CD player, which will usually just send me home immediately.  However, tonight I decided I could work out with no music to motivate me.  I did my usual weight circuit.  I saw people tonight that I had never seen before.  I felt really good because my new eating habits are beginning to pay off.  "Ooh don't let me start loving myself!"  I may go run tomorrow before my seminar.  I decided to go by Borders Books on my way home because I really need a book for ACT! 6.0, which is my sales contact management software.  I know how to get around in it, but I'd like to do some more things like create custom fields and generate reports.  I like to mosey around book stores.  I looked at the new titles and once again remembered that I want to read some of the classics this year.  Last year, I read  The Great Gatsby  and enjoyed it.   This year, I want to read  Dracula  and  Frankenstein .  I looked to see if they had the Pet Shop Boys  Pop Art  DVD, but they did not.  I'm saving my gift certificate to purchase that.  I looked through the David Beckham book simply because I like to read gossip about him and Posh Spice.  I'm fascinated by the way the British press reports their every move.  It's like watching a car wreck... especially when he had those dreadlocks that made him look like a blonde Tootie from  The Facts Of Life .  Bill Phillips has published a new  Body For Life  spin-off book entitled  urlLink Eating For Life: Your Guide To Great Health, Fat Loss And Increased Energy .  I did the  Body For Life  program two years ago and achieved some results, but it's a bit hard to maintain.  The recipes looked very tasty and easy to prepare.  I may have to purchase a copy.  I also noticed they had a copy of  urlLink Swimming To Antarctica: Tales Of A Long-Distance Swimmer  by Lynne Cox.  When she was just 15 years old, Lynne Cox broke both the men's and women's record times for swimming the English Channel.  She has also swam the Magellan Strait and the Bering Strait.  As some of you may know, I'm fascinated by swimming and the sea.  I also hate the cold.  Therefore, I'm interested to read this book by a woman who has typically swam in very cold waters... without a shark cage!  I visited the grocery store this evening and bought some low carb frozen dairy dessert.  It is sort of like ice milk.  I chose the cinnamon flavor because I'm a big fan of chocolate-cinnamon from Jake's Ice Cream.  It's interesting, but certainly no substitute for Jake's.  I considered buying an eggplant, but I'm not sure what to do with it.  I think I'll look up some recipes before the next trip to Publix.  It also occured to me that someone should invent low-carb mash potatoes.  Would someone please get to work on this?  Thank you.         You're  One Hundred Years of Solitude !   by Gabriel Garcia Marquez     Lonely and struggling, you've been around for a very long time. Conflict has filled most of your life and torn apart nearly everyone you know. Yet there is something majestic and even epic about your presence in the world. You love life all the more for having seen its decimation. After all, it takes a village.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

       LUNCH AT THE DISCO DINER   Tim suggested that we have lunch at the Disco Diner on North Avenue today.  I was a bit dubious about the quality of the food, but thought it might be fun.  Even though the Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) gave it a horrible review, I figured that Tim was just the kind of person who it could be a fun experience with.  The Disco Diner is in an A-frame building, which used to be an International House Of Pancakes (IHOP).  It's painted eggplant and fuscia.  On the inside, there are tiny mirror balls everywhere and old record covers from the 70's make a border along the top of the walls.  I must say that the a-ha  Train Of Thought  12" from 1986 does not match the theme, yet the poster of Linda Blair in  Roller Boogie  made up for it.  A very pleasant woman with some remaininig teeth seated us in the back.  A middle-aged black man was our waiter and he seemed to have a great deal of trouble taking our drink order, which consisted of two Diet Cokes.  We perused the menu and pondered if we should go for the  Shaft Burger  and then throw caution to the wind and top it off with a  Boogie Brownie .  When our waiter returned with our drinks, Tim asked about the  Atkins Combos  that were displayed on the sign out front.  Our waiter didn't know anything about them.  It seems that when he mentioned that he just started today, he actually came in an hour or so earlier to fill out an application and was already waiting on tables.  He fetched the pleasant, dental-challenged woman and she explained that while the Disco Diner advertised  Atikins Combos , they didn't have them on the menu yet.  You see, they were all upstairs.  "You have food upstairs?" I asked.  "No," she chuckled. "We have all of our  Atkins Combo  menus upstairs, but you can just order anything off the menu and we'll just slap an extra serving of meat along side of it." Tim and I decided on the  Funky Chicken Salad  with fruit salad on the side.  The waiter had to read the menu to find out what this meant and after some study jotted down a detailed account of our order in more time than it took me to take my SAT test in high school.  After he shuffled off, Tim and I chatted a while before I noticed something behind Tim.  "Is that a bullet hole in the window behind you?"  Tim turned around, stuck his finger in the hole and then said, "Yep.  We're sitting in the safest spot in the place.  Bullets never hit the same place twice."  Comforting.  After half an hour, half of our order arrived.  Our fruit salad consisted of a bowl of perfunctory cantelope.  In spite of the food and service, we had a good time catching up and singing along to classic disco hits like  In The Navy ,  La Freak ,  Beethoven's 5th  and  We Are Family .  On the way out, our snaggletoothed friend ran to the register, took our check and began to search desperately for the key to the register, which turned out to be a butter knife.  The Disco Diner seems to have the latest in security.  Tim and I were able to reformat the hard drive on my desktop this afternoon and we set it up at my desk again.  The new ViewSonic flat-panel monitor is great.  It's so big that I feel like I'm at the drive-in.  Of course, now I'll have to spend the next week reinstalling software, but it's good to have my old keyboard back.  I have missed my ten-key.  I'm still feeling a bit down about the events of Friday afternoon.  In our  Quest  class at church, Susan asked us whether or not we thought suffering was necessary.   I said that it was because it is the challenges that we attract in our lives that help us shed the old skin and expose the new skin.  It really resonated with me after I said that and I felt that there must be a link between the events of Friday and what I had just said.  In other words, the situation that occured on Friday is one of those experiences that I must go through to get to where I need to be.  I understand that logically, but there is still an after-taste of disappointment in my mouth.

       I AM A BOWLER OF ONE   Several years ago when I was in art school, I took a graphic design class focusing on symbols with Mr. D.  He was originally from Africa and asked to imagine coming to the U.S. for the first time and trying to make sense of the signs and symbols in the airport.  Mr. D. had a strong accent so I found my attention wandering until I noticed that he kept referring to Christian singer, Amy Grant.  I had no idea why.  The connection between Amy Grant and U.S. symbol interpretation by non-English speaking visitors was not patent to me.  Finally, another member of the class spoke up and asked what Amy Grant had to do with any of this.  Mr. D. stared at her for a moment, his lips twitched to the left, then the right before her said to her with much emphasis, "Not Amy Grant, the singer!  Em-ee-grant from nuther country!"  Oh, that's something else altogether, isn't it?  Mr. D. worked for an advertising agency.  I believe he was the art director.  His company was working on the  Army Of One  campaign for the U.S. Army.  I always thought it was a neat perspective of challening the individual to realize his or her best.  However, it also reminded me of the Bjork song  Army Of Me , which was featured in the movie,  Tank Girl .  Tonight we went bowling with Tony & Thom.  It was a fundraiser for the HRC.  I started off very badly.  I couldn't seem to get my approach right and when I released the ball, I swung to low and almost dug the lane up.  I was throwing balls too far to the right, so I adjusted by moving to the right.  Then I began throwing balls to the left, so I adjusted by moving to the left.  I was becoming frustrated at myself for seeming incapable of getting it together.  Tony made a comment to cheer me on thinking that I was upset at being in last place.  I laughed and explained that I could care less about my score as compared to others.  I was frustrated with myself because I knew I could bowl better, but for some reason was unable to do my personal best.  I always like to challenge myself to do a little bit better each time.  Finally, at the end of the second game, it all came together and I became Mr. Spare and Mr. Strike.  There is a funny story behind bowling for me.  I transferred from Tarrant County Junior College (TCJC) to the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and in my last semester before I graduated, I was advised that my Physical Education (PE) credits did not transfer.  Therefore, my last semester of school consisted of two bowling clases and golf.  I got pretty good at bowling.  My highest game was a 188.  I used to bowl with an Asian student who would just run up to the edge of the lane and dump the ball onto the lane as if she were throwing out radio active waste.  One time she even got a strike!  Anyway, today's experiences made me look at myself and evaluate whether or not I am trying for my personal best in all areas of my life.  I'll need to reflect on this some more.  What about you?

       OOH DON'T LET ME START LOVING MYSELF!   I'm feeling a bit sad today.  I was scheduled to close a purchase next week and the lender denied the loan at the last minute.  This is the first time I've ever had this happen and I just feel awful.  I had taken the loan application, checked with the account executive at the lender and then ran the information through the on-line underwriting system and received a pre-approval.  Now two days before the closing the underwriter at the lender says they won't grant the loan.  I got into this business to help people and I really feel like I let somone down.  I'm meeting with another lender on Monday morning to see if there may be another way.  Keep your fingers crossed because I'm not giving up yet.  Ironically, after my political post from 2/18/04, my friend Gloria sent me an e-mail entitled  Resume For A President , which lists all the singularities about President Bush that make him so special.  All joking aside, I was appalled at some of the information in the e-mail.  Granted, I'm assuming that this information is true and I have not researched any of it to verify its validity.  If you would like a copy of the e-mail, post a request in the comments section or  urlLink e-mail me.   Joan came over tonight to discuss something that had been on her mind.  It's amazing how our ability to communicate has improved over 16 years.  I was honored that she valued my opinion enough to express what she had to say.  And to think, our friendship almost ended when she ejected the Bananarama  WOW!  cassette out of my car stereo without permission and then went on to say that she really didn't care for Kim Wilde's spirited version of  You Keep Me Hangin' On .  Just imagine!  Anyway, we were discussing how debilitating television can be and it made me think how astounded people are when I tell them I really don't watch television.  I may watch an hour a month... and its purely chance.  There is a story behind it, but I'll save it for later.  This made me think of my friend, Steve, who chooses not to own a television because he will sit and watch it for hours.  He tells people, "Jesus won't let me watch television." I was reading  urlLink sometimeshappy  this evening, which I decided to click on while visiting Eric's blog,  Lost Somewhere In Texas .  He mentioned that he chose not to own a television.  Another coincidence?  Probably, but it's more fun to speculate that fate was somehow involved.  There is also an interesting story about Troy's co-worker.  He has written some interesting things on his blog, which indicate a questioning mind and some amazing art work.  If you have a moment, venture over and have a look.  Speaking of artists, I have been hankering to visit  urlLink Joe Phillips ' Web site.  If you have never seen his work, you should take a sneaky peak of this former D.C. Comics' artist.  I love his use of the gradient tool.  My favorite thing is the  urlLink Dancer .  It's an animation of a club kid dancing to the Uncanny Alliance's  I'm Beautiful Dammit! , which has been rerecorded by Bette Midler.  It's an uplifting song about finding the beauty and value in yourself.  "Ooh don't let me start loving myself!" My favorite line is where she says, "Uh-huh.  Yes, I woke up today and discovered that I am fierce!"  Aren't we all?

       GIRLS COME FIRST...   On the way back from lunch today, Robert and I saw a license plate holder that said, "Girls come first..."  On the bottom it continued, "In Girl Scouting."  I don't know who the guy was in the SUV, but I found more satisfaction in imagining him to be a predator of young women than a henpecked husband.  It also made me wonder what our cars say about ourselves to the rest of the world.  I drive a 1995 Mazda Miata MX5 with a black top.  It has a glass rear window, which is not original.  Does this say that I am transparent?  Does it imply that I like to look back and see where I've come from?  I have a luggage rack that has a sticker on it that reads, "Holds up to 28 pounds."  Does this indicate that I have felt burdened in the past or I am just a poser when it comes to suitcase support?  I drive a red convertible.  Does that imply that I'm going through a midlife crisis?  (Gee, I am 36yo.)  Does it imply that I'm looking for a young chick to make me feel young again?  (Hey, maybe that's why that guy had the Girl Scout license plate holder!)  My car rides low.  Does this imply that I like to look up ladies' skirts?  I have a kick ass stereo system in my car.  Does that mean I am a Chicano drug lord or that just like to play dance music very loud to stay awake behind the wheel?  I don't know.  I love my car because it's fun to drive, I can get just about any parking space I want and I like to feel the sun and wind when I drive with the top down.  It would be interesting to hear what other people think when they see you drive down the road.  What do you think your car says about you?  I went to the Billboard Web site and I didn't see  Body Language  in the Top 100 so it doesn't sound like sales faired too well in its first week of release for the singing budgie from down under.  I went to  urlLink www.kylie.com , you know, the official Web site, but there was nothing there either.   I watched the video for her new single,  Red Blooded Woman , and I wasn't very impressed.  Where has my Kylie gone?  What have they done with her?  I don't care for this album as much as her previous work and I certainly don't care for her new Bridget Bardot look.  She dates a French Man and look what happens?!  I just want to walk over to her, slap those freedom fries out of her hand and help her smell the cappucino.  I like the  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy  soundtrack.  I was a little worried about how they are trying to milk the Queer Eye cash cow for all it's worth, but the album is very good.  The Chemical Brothers remix of Kylie's  Slow  is the best remix of that song and I like several other songs on the album.  I love the Jason Nevins remix of the Duran Duran song.  That got me thinking today.  I have finally grown into one of those middleaged folk that buys every new album by any pop star/band from their generation.  Fleetwood Mac has been replaced by Duran Duran.  I actually caught myself listening to lite rock today on the radio while I was going through the ATM.  I was singing along with the Bee Gees as they asked me how deep my love was... and I liked it.  I don't like to think about Maurice being dead.  He was a staple of my childhood.  I don't mind growing older, but I want my childhood celebrities to remain the same.  I dream of happy land in my heart where ABBA is forever young, but I know in my head that they are not.  A few years ago I picked up Angatha's autobiography, opened the cover, screamed and almost dropped the book.  Time has not been kind to that woman... or she doesn't believe in moisturizer.  It inspired me to go home and iron.

       THE TIME HAS COME   I had one of those watershed moments tonight at my writers' group meeting.  We were discussing how we keep ourselves motivated to write each day.  I mentioned that I try to update my blog daily as it has allowed my writing to improve while stimulating my creative juices.  However, I went on to add that I have noticed most of my posts tend to be a rugurgitation of the events of my day with a few of my odd mind wanderings to boot.  I have realized over time as I have read other blogs, and from reading Rebecca Blood's book, that the more powerful blogs are the ones that are succinct and focus on one topic each day.  I have wanted to begin writing in this format, but it's like changing your eating habits or giving up smoking.  I kept saying that I would do it one day.  Tim in my writer's group asked for my blog address this evening.  I paused for a moment.  My blog is such a personal thing.  The matter of fact way he asked for it produced an emotional reaction inside of me as if I had been asked if I liked masturbating with sand paper.  I gave him the address, but qualified it by mentioning that my posts tend to be daily diatribes.  He mentioned that he is quickly bored with blogs like that and I instinctively knew it was the Universe's way of saying, "C'mon son, why don't you put that cigarette down?"  So sports fans, tonight I embrace a life of brevity.  I must admit that I have noticed some startling political opinons developing within my psyche.  I've never believed that I should automatically be a Democrat based on sexual orientation alone, but some of the more vocal Republicans have effectively put up a roadblock that prevents me from siding with them either.  I grow weary of each political party pointing a finger at the other and blaming the evils of our country on the other team.  We vote for a candidate and whether we agree with all of their political views or not, once they are in office, we get everything the party stands for.  It's a lot like ordering chicken fried steak that only comes with a baked potato and you can't substitute it for a healthy side salad for only a $1.95 more.  Do we really want to choose a whole candidate based solely upon their position on gay marriage?  Why can't we just vote on the right person for the job and have them just take care of the issue at hand?  The ignorance of most voters in our country as they enter the polls frightens me.  They go into the voting booth armed only with a few pieces of information they may have heard on talk radio, which may be more fiction than fact.  We hear what each candidate says, but then we need someone to interpret the fact within what they said and compare that to their actions in the past.  Even then, the information has probably been spin doctored by the "liberal media."  And we all know what we read on the Internet is true.  What is the answer?  I don't know... and that's the part that really frightens me.  Basically, the power lies within me, but am I strong enough to make the time to follow this election and educate myself.  It's so much easier not to.  If only it was instinctual like sex drive.  We'd vote every 15 minutes.  Random thought - As I was cleaning out the refrigerator tonight to make room for leftovers from the meeting, I found an old bottle of Bailey's Irish Creme.  For some reason, I felt I had to reach out and touch the bottle and I smiled.  It was like finding an old mumified lover in the back of your closet or under your sink.  It brought back fond memories and I wondered, "Why didn't I keep up with this?"

       TODAY MY MOTHER TURNED 60 YEARS OLD   I receive two more leads today.  Things are looking good.  My student loan will be paid off in no time and I'll be completely debt free.  Woo Hoo!  Robert was sick today so I got a lot done at work today.  I worked on marketing.  On my way home this evening, it occured to me that my life had changed so much between 1994 and 1996.  In 1994, I had just moved out from living with Chris for four years.  I moved in with Donald only to find out that my new roommate was a nudist with a penchant for lite rock lassies and reading biographies on presidential first ladies.  Donald always kept the apartment in perfect harmony in case photographers for  Better Homes & Gardens  might show up at any moment.  In Donald's world, there was no such things as "counter space."  I had my second to last "growing experience" relationship that left me devastated.  I began listening to Marianne Williamson and studying A Course In Miracles (ACIM).  Two years later, most of my friends had moved out of my life and I had moved to Atlanta.  The only person I knew was 2F's and I didn't even know him that well.  He was busy volunteering for the Olympics and with out-of-town guests.  Tonight I tried to remember what life was like in Dallas driving home at this time of night and this time of year.  I can remember one instance where I was listening to the Pet Shop Boys  Very  album.  (It's the one that looks like a big piece of orange Lego.)  It's cold, but not horribly so.  It's not quite warm.  There is the anticipation of a change coming.  I wonder what my life would be like now if I had not moved to Atlanta?  Who would my friends be?  Who would I be in a relationship with?  Would I have a pet?  What part of town would I live in?  Where would I work?  What would your life be like if you had chosen a different fork in the road ten years ago?  Tonight was the GPNA meeting.  I believe it was the shortest meeting I had ever been to.  There was no drama.  There were no protracted diatribes... even when visual aids were involved.  (They always make me nervous.)  I even received a compliment from the guy who took the minutes last year.  We ate at  Dakota Blue  on our way home.  Jeff from Canada had left a message on the machine.  It's always nice to hear from him.  He's rockin' with the Chemical Brothers.  I called my mom and she had a lovely day.  They went to Olive Garden for dinner.  Her tryglycerides are high so her doctor put her on a diet.  She has discovered Breyer's low carb ice cream and she is in heaven.  You know you've grown up when you're discussing what you can and cannot eat with your mother.  I'm still trying to get the gumption up to eat a bit of the cottage cheese in the refrigerator.  My mother told me to try it with pineapple, but it's not on my approved list.  I sent her a  Harry Potter  birthday card and she loved it.  The woman adores the little bespectled wizard.  I also sent her a gift certificate to PF Changs.  The woman loves her lettuce wraps.  Jefffifer sang happy birthday to her on the speaker phone and 2F's harmonized on the end.  He knows that I always sing lead and do all the hand motions.  We blend well.  My writer's group meets at the house tomorrow and I could not be less prepared.  2F's took his book inventory upstairs.  I need to clean the whole house tomorrow evening and prepare some nibbly things before they get here.  I haven't even written anything to share tomorrow.  Perhaps I'll work on  Meet Mr. Martinez .  For a bit of fun, I suggest that you check out the  urlLink Landover Baptist Bible Sex Quiz Part III  to find out if Middle Eastern men have large "external appendages" and great sexual prowess. I also received my first Entertainment Weekly today in the mail and the cover story is on Mel Gibson's The Passion.  For an interesting companion piece, Landover Baptist has posted  urlLink Five True Christian Questions For Mel Gibson .  It's interesting reading.  I'm also thinking about ordering a  urlLink Vacation Bible Gun Camp  bumper sticker or a  urlLink The Last Time Jesus Showed Up At Church, They Killed Him  baseball jersey.

       HOUSTON, WE HAVE DSL   It's true.  My DSL connection is back up and running.  Even after sending my new DSL modem to my former place of employment, I was still able to reenter the fast-paced world of broadband.  "Sing the lullaby of Broadband"  Maybe not.  To celebrate, I called 2F's at work and said, "Hey, gues what I'm doing on the other end of the phone?"  He quickly gave a curt reply as if I was Danny Arrugio, his crack dealer, and hung up on me.  I just wanted to tell him that now we could talk on the phone and surft the Internet at the same time.  I felt inspired to listen to Gloria Estefan on the way to work today.  I listened to her most recent greatest hits album with the updated version of  Conga .  Let me tell you, I didn't think I could control myself any longer.  I switched to the Falco remix album and answered the age old question I ask myself whenever I find it in my CD collection: how come I never listen to this?  Luckily, I bought it for a dollar.  Then I listened to the second Bros album.  Does it say something about my character when I enjoy the meteoric rise of a pretty boy band to the top in the late 80's only to watch them plummet to the depths of obscurity four years later like a  Different Strokes  cast member.  I just know that Dixie Carter is going to rob a liquor store one day soon while Hal Holbrook waits in the el camino with the engine running.  Anyway, it's not like Matt & Luke Goss, twins, had any real talent like Susan Lucci.  Don't laugh!  She may be a one trick pony, but to quote the Pet Shop Boys she has made such a little go a very long way.  I think she's tremendous!  It appears that I will be able to do something for my Spanish-speaking couple.  I'm really excited about helping them.  For lunch, I had a tuna fish salad wrap, which is an unusual choice for me because I am not particularly fond of tuna fish salad.  This is mainly because 2F's puts pickles in it and I don't particulary find pickles to be a very clever idea.  It's basically a mumified cucumber in formaldahyde.  It was quite tasty.  It came with a side cart of mixed fruit and a 20 ounce Diet Coke with a twist of lemon.  Mmmm... delicious!  Robert and I had an interesting conversation about goal setting today.  He couldn't understand why we have not been able to accomplish more of our goals.  I told him my theory is very simple, but two fold: set goal and then take action.  I then went on to say that I planned to do severl things this week to generate new business and my plan was to do certain things on certain days... no matter what else came up.  This works for me.  I saw a glint of fear in his eyes.  This is a brave new step for our boy, Roberto.  He enters each day with a different agenda each day.  It should be interesting, sports fans.  I'll keep you posted.  On the way home from work today, one of my former clients came to mind.  I had met her at a networking event and I made a note to contact her.  When I arrived home, she had sent me an e-mail at exactly the time I was thinking about her.  Hmmm, we say....  I made Key West Salmon tonight.  It was flavorful, but the not the best fish I've had.  I made the artichoke salad again because 2F's liked it so much the other night.  The salad and I were not one tonight, but I made my way through most of it.  I had a refreshing glass of iced tea with a twist of lemon.  (Do you see a pattern?)  I ironed shirts while watching the Erasure  Pop!  The First 20 Videos compilation .  I thought Andy looked best in the A Little Respect video.  I also decided that the majority of their videos are rubbish, but should be required viewing for  Homosexual Music Appreciation 101 .  Ironically, I met Andy in a cowboy bar in Fort Worth while playing pool with my drama teacher from high school.  He bought me my first Corona and impressed me by giving a drag queen a $100 tip.  One of the people in our crowd asked how much he was worth and he told her $7,000,000.  When Lindy asked a question, she was very serious about it.  She was never pretentious so you always just told her the truth.  Kent, who was a huge Erasure fan, really didn't give Andy the time of day.  Afterwards, I drove Andy back to his hotel and we were discussing music.  Madonna's  Deeper And Deeper  came on the radio and he said that Madonna should have given that song to Kylie.  I mentioned that I liked the new Bananarama song,  Last Thing On My Mind .  He called them tired old tarts.  I was glad to see the hotel entrance up on the right hand side.  Andy went on to say that he had dinner with Dave Stewart and Siobhan when he was in L.A.  He was fascinated by how their kids wore those flip flop shoes and he said that Siobhan was very intelligent.  After that, I decided to actually stop the car before asking him to drag his carcas out of my passenger seat.  Other than that, he was really a very nice fellow.

       "I THINK OF YOU ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS"   It was a lovely day today.  I got up early and drove to church in the rain.  I listened to Madonna's  Erotica  on the way as I just started  Goddess: An Unauthorized Biography Of Madonna .  My friend, Meredith gave it to me for Christmas and I've become fascinated with the author's theories on Madge more so than the Material Girl herself.  Anyway, when I arrived, I discovered the blonde lady who usually goes off on tangents was leading our class this morning.  She was very concerned that I had no paper to write on, but I assured her that I would be fine.  She asked us to write down our thoughts about how we have affected other people in our lifetimes and what the world would be like if we had never existed.  Dave mentioned that his ex-wife probably would not have gone on that cruise.   Kitty (I love that name!) mentioned that her daughter would not have had a decent wedding.  I mentioned that I feel that God has a purpose for bringing people together and if I had not existed, God would have sent someone else.  It's a bit egotistical to think that I am the only man for the job.  Granted, it might not be done in quite the same style as I would have done it, but it would have been done none the less.  In my lifetime, I feel that I am focusing more on forgiveness and that might influence my response to another.  Someone else may be focusing on trusting God to take care of him or her and that might color their response.  Furthermore, we each carry a spark of God within us and God is experiencing what it is like to be on earth as we go through the events of our lives.  Afterwards, I had a low-carb wrap at Subway and went to the bank to get some cash.  I had a very strong feeling that I should go to the Wherehouse Music on Peachtree.  For some inexplicable reason, I wanted to purchase a used copy of  The Bridge  by Ace Of Base.  Lo and behold, the store is going out of business and used CD's are 50% off.  I bought the Ace Of Base CD for a dollar and picked up a  San Francisco Days  by Chris Isaak and a cool Village People compilation with '93 remixes of  Macho Man ,  YMCA ,  Can't Stop The Music  and  In The Navy .  There is a feeling in the air that reminded me of several years ago when I purchased a copy of Vanessa Daou's  Zipless  album.  She is married to the nephew of Erica Jong and they put several of her poems to music.  It's very sultry, acid jazz/dance music.  There is a song called  Sunday Afternoons , which is about a woman who writes at her desk remember a gentleman caller who visits her every Sunday afternoon and makes love to her.  It's a sexy song with a choice word or two.  It's a very cool album.  Elaine came over and I helped her with some of her assignments for her on-line Master's course.  It was pretty interesting.  I'd like to get my Master's degree that way.  We came across www.thehonestthief.com.  It has an interesting story behind it.  Check it out!  After Elaine left, I did laundry, walked down to CVS to buy a paper and then came back and read it on the couch in my sweats.  It wasn't even dark yet at 6:00pm.  There were editorials in the AJC about how the FCC should not exercise censhorship, Abe Lincoln was spiritual but did not belong to a Christian church and the bruhaha over  The Da Vinci Code .  I've always been interested in the early Christian Church and read a lot about it back in 1995.  I was doing some more reading in the literature that Susan Tramell gave us at last week's new member orientation.  I was surprised to find that Unity is not a new thought church.  I'm not sure where I got that in my head.  Granted the focus is more on living the principles that Jesus taught than fixating on the crucifixtion.  There's  a lot to mull over.  Yesterday was a good day too.  Carmen came down and we drove around the corner to take a loan application for the Spanish-speaking family.  There were a nice family, but translating slows things down.  It took three hours.  I'll need to do more research to find out what programs they qualify for.  I hope I can help them.  Oddly enough, they were the family that bought 2F's old entertainment center at the yard sale in 2000.  Small world!  I went to Wholefoods yesterday because I decided to make a Valentine's Day dinner since 2F's and I decided to stay in.  Wholefood's is always a challenge for me because you walk in and it feels like you're in a head shop as the pungent smells of incense overpowers your nostril holes.  It was crowded, but I found that if I parked my shopping cart in dairy and ran over to produce on the other side of the store, I could easily shop without a buggy altercation and work in some cardio at the same time.  Sadly, Wholefoods did not have orzo pasta.   I wasn't sure what it was so it was hard to make a substitution.  Baking chocolate was also out of the question.  Finally after an hour and a half, I checked out and drove another block to Kroger, which has begun to look really run down.  I drove slowly behind the shopping cart attendant and pressured him into running up hill with a full shopping cart train.  I almost felt badly about it, but he looked like he needed the exercise.  I easily found orzo, which looks like rice.  I had a wide selection of baking chocolates and some small baking pans.  I came home just in time to start dinner.  So much for writing yesterday afternoon.  Things went very well.  I took it one dish at a time and it was done in less than two hours.  I baked a small cake, made breaded green beans, an artichoke salad, orzo mushrooms and champagne chicken.  It all tasted FABULOUS!  And I don't use the "F" word lightly, friends.  I amazed myself.  2F's ate heartily and Buddy salivated from below the table.  The deep chocolate raspberry cake was good, but it just tasted like a really rich brownie with raspberries.  I found a little hot Hershey's syrup livened it up.  Shortly after, I passed out when 2F's suggested that we finish off the bottle of champagne.  I'm such a lightweight for bubbly!  So what did y'all do?

       MISSING TIME IN MY WORLD  Today flew by for me.  It was a light day.  Robert was a whirlwind of manic energy.  We were having a conversation and I mentioned that I felt I had worked really hard this week and he made a comment as if I was complaining that I had worked too hard and this is the type of week he wants to have every week.  I had thought about clarifying the matter, but then realized it wasn't that important to me.  I like it when there is a third party around because Robert mentions all the exciting things that we are doing.  Sometimes it's the first time I have heard about it too.  However, a lot of what Robert says never happens anyway.  He's come a long way since his anxiety attacks last summer, but I'm beginning to notice that my speed is a little more subdued and consistent.  One of our realtors that had contacted us to work with us exclusively.  He rescinded his offer.  It seems his loan officer is no longer quitting the business and he's going to stay with him.  Oh well, things happen for a reason.  I finished work today here at home.  I decided that I wanted to create an Excel spreadsheet that would automatically calculate all the mortgage information.  I'm having problems programming partial interest and APR.  I'm really impressed with what I have done, but my mind is fried.  I had planned to do a lot of things tonight.  I worked on this spreadsheet for hours.  2F's informed me that all the images I have scanned need to be rescanned twice the dpi that I scanned them at.  Ugh!  After I finish this, I'm going to take a break from the historical committee.  I want to devote more time to my writing.  Tomorrow I am meeting with a Spanish-speaking family to take a loan application. We'll see how this goes.  I was thinking about my friend, Blaise, today between Piedmont and Peachtree.  After some careful consideration, I have decided that I prefer not to have a tail and will no longer resist evolution... even though it is not allowed in the Georgia Public School ciriculum.

       HOT DAMN, I HAVE A BICYCLE!   Mark came by tonight and brought me his old bicycle.  I'm jazzed.  I've been wanting to buy a bike, but unsure of how much I wanted to spend.  To get a really decent serious bike, you need to spend at least a thousand dollars, if not more.  Fortunately, there was no basket with plastic daisies that I had to cut off the front.  Some people would be intimidated by the fact that there is no seat, but I'm sure I can get one at a bike shop or just tie a piece of frozen brie on top to sit on.  I'm looking forward to getting it in shape and finding out how serious I want to become with biking.  I fell in love with inline skating again last spring and really didn't find much time to go to the skating trails.  I really think inline skating outdoors should be done in a thong with breast implants, but I'll make an exception for myself.  Who has time for breast implants?  The upstairs furnace has gone out again.  This means we are sleeping downstairs tonight.  It was a good excuse to clean off my bed.  Of course, I have to be careful where I put the stuff that was on the bed.  You just can't throw it on the floor because 2F's gets up during the night.  I haven't received the approval on that large insurance policy for him yet so....  He was so cute this morning when he left for work.  He had on his little white shirt and little patterned tie with his little bitty glasses that make him look so cute.  Tonight he was in the living room organizing his books for his store in his little bitty glasses and he looked so cute.  That reminds me.  2F's is pretty focused on whatever project he is working on.  He will interrupt the conversation to announce that he received divine inspiration on how to caulk that window upstairs that has been causing him to lose sleep.  He will stop in the throes of passion to ask, "Do you think I should have a section for romance novels about schizophrenics?"  I suppose that is why he is so successful.  Today was not a good Robert day for me at work.  I was busy putting together two files for a lender we have not used yet.  It's a good file, but I had to make sure that I addressed any detail that the underwriter might question.  Robert was in a chipper mood.  He whistled.  He asked me questions every few minutes or commented on everything.  He drummed out percussion solos on his desk.  Typically, nothing phases me, but today, I was a bit more sensitive.  Is that Robert's problem?  No.  I should be able to let these things slide, but today I did not.  So it was.  At lunch, he asked me, "So do gay people celebrate Valentine's Day like heterosexuals?"  I looked at him blankly and replied, "Yes, we all put out in hopes of receving jewelry."  I keep forgetting that I'm his tour guide through the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgendered (GLBT) Universe.  I like to say GLBT.  It sounds like a specialty sanwich at TGI Fridays.  After several months, I am beginning to appreciate Kylie's  Body Language  more, but it's still not my favorite album.  It's sort of like Urban Kylie or R&B Kylie, which I could just say Urb Kylie or Rub Kylie for short.  Perhaps not.  I think I'll like it better if I learn the lyrics to the songs.  I'm a big sing-a-long guy in the car.  Why somedays I get so into the music, that I wouldn't be surprised if a hand reached up from the back seat and handed me a tambourine.  Which would be rather interesting considering that I drive a Miata MX5 convertible... without a backseat.  Mark made me some CDR's and he gave them to me tonight when he dropped off the bike.  I'm quite excited to listen to the Dandy Warhols because I love  Bohemian Like You .  He made me a copy of Bryan Ferry, Dead Can Dance and something called Euro Trash.  Maybe it was Euro Traxx.  It's all good.  Since I could not obtain a reservation to the restaurant of my choice for Saturday, I'm going to cook dinner instead.  I went to the  urlLink All Recipes.com  Web site and planned my romantic dinner for two.  We're having Champagne Chicken, Orzo with Mushrooms and Walnuts, Salad with Artichokes, Green Beans with Bread Crumbs and Deep Chocolate Raspberry Cake with Jerry Matthers as the Beaver.  No, really... skip the Beaver!  Come to think of it, wouldn't  Leave It To Beaver  be a great title for a lesbian skin flick?  I'm sure it has already been made.  Anyway, this is a great resource because when you find the recipe you want, you can change how many servers you need and it will automatically adjust the ingredients.  I spent a lot of time tonight reading some helpful articles on how to cook a live lobster and shuck an oyster.  Knowledge is power!  I cleaned my home desk off tonight.  I found a mysterious box behind the filing cabinet when I crawled behind my desk to pick up the pens that fell behind the desk.  I wonder what it is?  On a whim, I decided to finally start that second blog.  No, it's not the Jefrotica blog.  It's better.  Yes, it's the Bananarama Tarot blog where you can have your fortune read every day with the assistance of British girl group: Bananarama.  Go  urlLink here  to receive your daily reading.

       WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE...   I used to drink a lot of water, in fact, about 70 ounces a day.  Then I started my career in the mortgage industry and Diet Coke seemed to enter in my life.  I was working late and she was in the office with me wearing that shiny little can.  I noticed that H20 and I had become estranged.  I would come home and find it sitting on my desk where I had left it that morning.  "Where you been?" "Work." "I've missed you." "Yeah." "You don't drink me much anymore." "Don't start." "Is that neutra sweet I smell on your lips?" "Hey!  I just need... some space, you know." "I just sit here alone by myself.  Trying to remember what it felt like to have your lips on the rim of my glass-" "Hey!  This is a family blog.  Show some respect."  I'm drinking more water these days and the soft drinks are caffeine free.  I just like a little fizz fizz now and then.  Know wha' I mean?!  I had sent Jeff of the Great Far North an e-mail with the letter from the State of Michigan about the beavers.  His dam reply made me laugh.  I don't know where Ray found the story, but it was quite humerous.  Jody turned 31 or 32 or 34 today.  I had heard she didn't want to make a big deal out of it.  I decided to stop and buy her a rose and birthday card on my way to work because she always takes care of all of us.  I arrived and there were a dozen roses in a box by her desk.  I looked at my little rose from Publix and left it on her desk.  Good Lord, who would have thought she would have been so moved by that little flower.  I'm glad we could make her day.  The whole office went out to eat at PF Chang's for lunch because Jody had never been and we had a great time.  It was Robert, Gail, Chris, Patty, Jody and myself.  We laughed and laughed and ate some more.  Went by R.'s apartment today to sign some additional paperwork for his purchase.  I have ordered most everything and we should be able to submit the file to the lender soon.  I asked him for two additional letters of explanation to cover every possible scenario that the underwriter might question.  When I left, he thanked me and said that I had gone above and beyond the call of duty for him and he really appreciated it.  You know, that's why I got into this business.  It made my whole day worthwhile.

       STANDING ROOM ONLY IN HELL OR SELF-MANAGEMENT OF THE MIND   Yesterday I went to church for two reasons: new membership class; and to have my photo taken for the church directory.  I actually arrived half an hour early.  I started to lash out at myself for wasting a precious half hour of time, especially after being sick and losing all of Sunday's productivity, but I just chilled.  I was able to spend some time talking to our instructor, Susan Trammell.  She has the most interesting hair.  It's short, straight and silver.  The class was good start.  Most of it I had already read on my own, but it was interesting to hear everyone's spiritual coming out stories.  I mentioned that my first conflict with organized religion occurred when I was four or five.  I grew up in the Church of Christ and my grandmother gave me the 411 on the fact that everyone but the Church of Christ was going to Hell.  Even my best friend Ronald, the Catholic, who lives next door?  Especially Catholics!  I remember thinking, "Ooh... that's rough.  I don't know that I can buy into that.  I mean, would the Fire Marshall really approve of standing room only in Hell?"   Needless to say, the doubt within me always kept me looking over my shoulder for Satan to come snatch me away to Hades for not being a true Christian.  I was baptized at 18 because my mother was afraid that I would be in a car wreck and die and go to Hell because I had not been baptized.  Preacher Carl and I climbed into the tank in wading boots, he dunked me and brought me up.  My mother teared up at this great spiritual moment in my life.  Then I put my arms in the air like Nadia Coma-neech and went, "TA-DAH!"  I had some interesting things happen in my late teens that inspired a reconnection with the divine, but in a non-traditional way.  I went through many different churches during my 20's and early 30's, but none of them felt right.  I guess you could say that I was a "religious swinger."  I was going to church with 2F's.  It was a quaint little Methodist church and I lvoed the people, but they were being moved to put their hands in the air and sway with the Holy Spirit.  My hands didn't go into the air unless I was in a club and were being moved by the holy spirit of Cher.  I could almost lip sync the entire service.  Pray.  Sing archaic hmyn here.  Say Lord's Prayer here.  Announcements.  Preacher tells jokes for too long and only has three minutes for sermon.  I felt bad one day when Ms. Martha got so excited by the strange far away look on my face at the end of a service.  She hugged me and was so proud that I had finally come under the influence of the Holy Spirit.  I just didn't have the heart to tell her that my pager had gone off on vibrate mode at the end of the service.  So I decided to give Unity a try and it just felt like home.  Almost everyone said that it felt like home.    At the end of class, I went upstairs for my photo session with Olan Mills.  Arlan was my photographer.  He was a crotchety old man who seemed to lust after a donut and a good cup of coffee.  I think there may also have been a post-doughtal cigarette involved as well.  Anyway, a Reba McEntire lookey-likey helped me view Arlan's artistic interpretation of me.  The first shot looked as if a dog had run up and stuck its cold, wet nose in my behind as Arlan took the picture.  The others weren't much better.  Arlan adjusted my hands, legs and neck as if I was an illustrated example of what not to do in yoga.  The one exposure that was good was taken right after Arlan said, "Jef, think about your girlfriend."  I almost swallowed my tongue laughing.  After an extensive explanation of papers, canvas and frames, Reba was trying to sell me some additional prints, which I was interested in purchasing for my family.  However, every time she opened her mouth, the package shrank from one 8x10 to two 5x7's to 12 wallet size.  The price changed too.  One time it was $79 and then $112.  I couldn't keep up.  I eventually told her that I had a previous photo session two weeks ago with the former photographer for the State of Georgia and I preferred those.  How many people can say that?  I could not go to to sleep last night.  I tried to finish typing minutes for the January GPNA meeting, which I was horribly behind in doing.  In fact, there are many things on my desk that I'm behind in doing.  I could use a couple of days at home.  Tomorrow and Thursday are full days with telemarketing in the evening.  Today I met someone that I thought I would like to get to know better if I were single.  He's a really nice guy, very down to earth.  It's nice to know that everything is still working.  Sometimes you get so wrapped up in day-to-day life that you lose touch with that side of your self.  Now, please do not start making masturbation puns because I said "touch" and still working doesn't imply erectile dysfunction.  I'm just saying that I had that enthusiastic feeling again like when I first met 2F's.  There are no problems at home.  In fact, I think some gay men ofen times mistake a feeling of rapport for sexual attraction or love.  I think it is more of a feeling of kindridship.  [Is that a word?]  It's a feeling of commonality.  That's really a better word for it.  When I think back to it, this person walked into my office and got really close into my personal space, smiled and then introduced himself.  My reaction was, "Whoa!  You are too close to the vehicle.  Please sit down."  Now that I look back on it all, I don't think relationship status has anything to do with it.  When you meet someone who has a great outlook on life, you want to spend time with that person instead of someone who ends every sentence with "-from hell."  Somone else had an effect on me today.  I found myself feeling betrayed, angry and even a bit jealous of someone that I don't even know.  As soon as I felt the emotions well up inside of me, I thought, "This is so irrational.  I refuse to participate in this madness.  I'm taking my ball and going home."  Then I remembered something that Susan had written on the dry erase board last night: self-management of the mind.  I realized that my emotions may have not been justified, but it was what I felt and perhaps I should just feel it.  So I did.  I noticed that it made me want to change what I wrote on my blog, which is so unrelated.  I don't know what the old blog is going to be like over the next few days.  I may be in transition, but I'd rather be in Australia.

       I’VE A FEELING WE’RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE   I’ve been sick today.  Actually, I began to feel under the weather yesterday about 6:00pm, but thought that I would feel better once I ate something.  Yesterday was busy.  I worked most of the day on the files I plan to turn in Monday. February is looking to be a very good month in regards to business.  In the first week, our amount of business tripled.  Woo hoo!  I was also able to give a friend my writer’s group some good news about his loan for his first home purchase.  That’s always a good feeling.  I was in the laundry room yesterday, when the phone rang.  I heard 2F’s yelling from upstairs and ran into the den to pick up the phone.  It was Paul saying that he and Boo, AKA Andrew, but not as much fun to say, were leaving to go to Doug’s party.  I finished folding laundry and 2F’s came down stairs and asked why I didn’t come upstairs when he yelled.  I thought he was trying to get my attention to answer the phone, but in actuality there was no soap in the shower and he didn’t have a towel.  I changed clothes and then he was angry with me for not being ready to go.  I didn’t know we had an exact time to be ready and didn’t feel good, so I dropped it.  Doug is a friend of Paul.  They are both professors at a local university.  They are vessels of knowledge regarding public policy.  I’m not sure what that means per se, but Doug teaches economics.  He is an affable guy who loves soccer and beer.  He is one of those guys that you just want to be your best friend.  He and Paul have been friends for a year or two and that’s how Jefffifer was introduce to Doug.  There was a sizable crowd at the party when we arrived.  The kitchen/dining room/computer command center was upstairs.  I went downstairs to sit.  I thought that if I just rested a bit, I might feel better.    There was a couple on the sofa.  He was from India or Pakistan I believe and she was a red-headed American.  She just gave birth to their second child on New Year’s Eve.  The older daughter was involved with a piece of bread that seemed to take her through many ever-changing moods.  I listened to the husband speak in the familiar sing-song accent and wondered what it must be like to hear someone like me try to speak his language.  Do Americans have our own sing-song accent?  If so, is it country & western, rock & roll or Broadway?  A few minutes later, another professor that Doug works with sat down and we began chatting.  Her name is Michelle and she lives in East Atlanta, which is the neighborhood next to Grant Park.  She is originally from Austin and we were talking about Texas, her mother who originally financed her home at 12%, but doesn’t want to refinance because it would mean she would have to find a lot of paperwork and the house Michelle and her husband are renting in East Atlanta.  She was talking about looking to buy a home and I was about to give her my business card when Jeff called me upstairs to eat something.  I had some grilled chicken.    Doug kept trying to offer me beer and popsicles.  I think he might have been a wee bit drunk.  He was playing various CD’s in his changer and I lit up when I heard Kirsty MacColl’s  In These Shoes .  We instantly bonded over the song and I will name my first born Doug.  He even knew she had been killed while swimming with her children off the coast of Can Cun.  Then we moved on to other topics.  I remember something about me being an honorary scapegoat and something being blamed on me.  Some people are just too cute when they are drunk.  Paul was in rare form last night.  Paul is a friend of 2F’s that he made through work.  It is interesting to note that Paul did not know about me for several months, but once we met, it was love at first sight.  He is my verbal sparring partner.  Or is conceptual sparring partner?  We wax on about spiritual matters.  He finds my obsession with all things Bananarama and Kylie to be intriguing if not disturbing.  He owns a horse and can be found often times tripping the lights fabulous with Boo at Hoe Downs.  There was an interesting girl at the party last night.  We were never properly introduced, but I remember she made note of my lightening fast thought process which can connect two completely unrelated topics at light speed.  2F’s said, “Welcome to my world.”  I told her that 2F’s sometimes gets frustrated with trying to follow my mind sometimes.  We were discussing Outkast’s  Hey Ya!  and I mentioned that it reminded me of the Beatles  Twist And Shout .  She couldn’t agree.  I felt a bit self-righteous when I read an interview with Outkast in the  Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC)  that described this ditty as Beatlesque.  I had no idea that this track was formed while driving around Interstate 285.  I forget how much music is created here in Atlanta.  Speaking of Outkast, we watched a download of a video called  Hey Ya, Charlie Brown!   If you haven’t seen it, you should do a Google search for it.  It is made up of various scenes from the Peanuts Christmas special set to the Outkast’s  Hey Ya!   The editing is phenomenal.   After we left, 2F’s is angry with me.  He thought that I spoke unkindly about him regarding being frustrated with following my thinking process.  He then brought up the soap and towel incident.  I told him that I still didn’t feel well.  He thought I was trying to change the subject, but it was just a heads up in case I blew chunks there in the car.  I was not feeling romantic last night.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling the imminent feeling of an impending vomit session.  I remembered once that if you feel nauseated, you should visualize the color orange.  I did and felt better.  After about half an hour, I felt bad again and made the trek to the bathroom to projectile vomit into the toilet.  I waited, belched and then felt better.  2F’s woke and gave me some Peptol Bismol and a cold wash cloth, which I had actually been craving for some time.  He is so sweet… even if he sometimes becomes frustrated with trying to follow my train of thought.  I went back to bed and felt much better.  This morning my stomach felt better, but I felt achy and slow.  I hung around the house and then went to the grocery store.  I’m moving into the new stage of the South Beach Diet where I can have fruit again and some pasta and bread.  I almost thought I wasn’t going to make it home.  2F’s had gone to his niece’s birthday lunch.  I sent a cook book to her because she is starting to do catering.  2F’s said it was a hit.  I made some Campbell’s chicken noodle soup for lunch along with a piece of toast with mozzarella cheese, a Jell-o sugar free strawberry Jell-o cup and a Diet Sprite.  I felt exhausted and went to lay down.  I read a little from a book that I bought while I was home for Christmas.  I had actually bought this book for Kent back in 1986.  He really enjoyed it and gave it to me to read.  I didn’t remember much about it other than it was quite funny.  The book is  I’ve A Feeling We’re Not In Kansas Anymore: Tales From Gay Manhattan  by Ethan Morden.  My reaction has been interesting.  The characters are from the late 70’s although the book was published in 1983.  It was a different gay world back then.  The fact that they lived in New York resulted in further differences I’m sure.  All in all, I can remember that book depressed me when I originally read it.  I must have been 19 or 20 tops.  It painted a very cynical look at the gay world in some respects.  I am happy to report that my life did not turn out to resemble the book at all.  It’s actually a very good document of history and Morden’s writing style is quite enjoyable.  I was a little disturbed by references to life being over after 30 since I’m 36.  Excuse me, but I’m just getting started.  There is one passage from the Mute Boy that I would like to share with you.  Here it is:       “Right,” I said, after we had walked on a bit.  “I’ve been in New York for seven years and I’ve seen, I think, everything.  But did that really happen?”      Mac shrugged benignly.      “He gave you a quarter!”      “People like me,” Mac wrote. “I’m nice.”      “What’s the secret of nice?” I wondered aloud.      “Forgiving,” he wrote.  Finally, I came across two poems that I wrote several years ago.  Einstein is one I wrote about Mark, whom I sort of dated back in 1994.  We lived in the same condo complex and it was a very strange relationship.  I think there may have been alcoholism in his family because he was the most emotionally unavailable person I ever met.  In fact, his heart was like a black hole.  However, he was a very nice guy.  That’s why I kept hanging on.  It ended after I ran into him at a viewing of the aids quilt with his other boyfriend.  I wrote this poem a few weeks later as I tried to make sense of it all.   Einstein   I don’t know much about love In fact, The more I love, The Less I know  I know it is forever Though we go our separate ways  Love is matter And matter can never be destroyed  I thought our love was solid, But it must have turned to gas Perhaps we should have been more fluid  I sometimes with I could dig Einstein up And give him a trim and comb his hair I’d say, “Albert!  Albert! What is the meaning of love?!” But I guess he would just lay there  Trying to get an answer out of Einstein, Is like wringing water from a stone The water is your love for me And your heart is the stone  You don’t have to be Einstein To know you don’t love me anymore  I don’t know much about love, But the more I love, The less I know  The other poem was one I wrote was for my friend Joan back in October of 1996.  Her mom had just died after struggling with both lung and then brain cancer.  It’s how I imagined I would feel if I were in her shoes.  I thought I would share it with you here since Marti, her sister, had written about her mother on her blog, Ramblings Of A Redhead.   11:15   It’s 11:15 and my mother just died Passed away to the other side And although I’ve mentally prepared myself for weeks I know my heart is slow to comprehend  Perhaps one day it will catch up with me As I’m driving down the road to some happy place I’ll pull over to the shoulder and sob violently As my whole body shakes  While bent over the steering wheel  I’m glad she’s out of pain, But there is a selfish part of me that still wants my mommy To take care of me when I don’t feel well And kiss my skinned knees And be there for me when the world is a cold place to live in  Photographs don’t do her justice She has to be live, not Memorex  I’m exhausted from staying up all night with her And the weeks of waiting and wondering when, But my mind is still racing And there’s no way on earth to escape her memory  Holidays are unfathomable  The idea of life without her is awkward Like adjusting to a new piece of furniture And learning how to maneuver around it  I must have said, “I love you!” a million times, But now I wonder if a million was enough  It just occurred to me that the Grammy’s were tonight.  I wonder if Kylie won for  Come Into My World ?  Her  Body Language  album is on sale in all the big stores this week for $9.99 with two additional tracks not on my Australian copy.  Gotta have it!  The  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy  soundtrack is also on sale for $9.99.  I think I’ll have to get that as well because it has the Chemical Brothers remix of Kylie’s  Slow  and a Fischerspooner Vs. Billy Squier track.    I just checked CNN.com.  Kylie won!  YEAH!!!  Life is good.

       ABBA-DABBA-DOO!   First, it started with the Bangles.  I had an inexplicable urge to listen to their Greatest Hits album.  (It's a short one.)  Then yesterday and today, I can't quit listening to ABBA.  I've been hitting repeat on The Visitors, The Winner Takes It All and The Day Before You Came.  It was a gentle day.  I took an application with Mr. G., the realtor today.  He cracks me up.  He always calls me "Baby" or "Sunshine" or "Doll."  He also cusses a lot in a pleasant way.  "The godammed government is always fuckin' screwin' me up the ass, sunshine!"  We received another lead today from another realtor.  This may be our record month.  Went to dinner with Tim tonight.  2F's, Tim and I went through Marshall's.  2F's was looking for shoes.  I found a cook book with 1000 dessert receipe, which includes three or four for different types of pavlova, which is one of my favorite desserts.  Since I am on a restricted diet right now, I wonder if I look like a guy with Penthouse as I look at the pictures of the various desserts.  We had dinner at Rock Bottom Brewery and I had the grilled chicken cashew salad, which was very good.  Afterwards, we came home.  2F's has gone to bed.  Drew wrote about a sign on a carwash today on his Not Enough Drew In The World blog.  It reminded me of a sign that is on the front of Backstreet, which is a popular gay club in Atlanta.  It states, "All deliveries in rear."  It makes me laugh every time.  Goodnight, Sunshine!

       ATLANTA JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL   I apologize for not posting last night.  After telemarketing, Robert and I talked for a couple of hours.  By the time I got home, I sat down for a second and I was fast asleep.  I picked up the contact sheets from our photo session.  They looked good, but I'm not particularly interested in seeing pictures of myself.  However, I was told that I am very photogenic.  Whatever!  I attended a really good marketing session today.  I'm looking forward to utilizing what I learned.  2F's said that the creator of Cabbage Patch Kids was at the capitol today.  Ironically, so were the Right To Life groups.  Makes you think, doesn't it?  I met 2F's tonight at the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival to see Yossi & Jagger, which is a film about two gay soldiers in the Israeli army.  It was very interesting, but the Jewish American Princess (JAP) who kept talking and sighing through the movie was not.    There is one soldier that is very closeted in the movie and one that is not.  After the closeted one scolds the more open one, 2F's put his hand in mine and set it on my lap where people could see.  Either the movie influenced him or I had a date with a pod person tonight.  I opened a book up this evening and found a prescription for amoxicillian from last June.  I guess I should take it in.

       "NO MORE NASTY NOSE HAIRS!"   I received an e-mail from Kathleen Williams wth the above caption in the subject line.  I do not know Kathleen, but she got my attention.  Today was a long day.  I was in the office by 9am and out by 9:30pm.  More loans are coming in.  Robert and I did the power struggle dance today, but we ended today on a good note.  Telemarketing did not go so well.  Tomorrow is a new day.  2F's was out tonight having dinner with a friend and arrived home at 11:30pm.  I think he had been drinking because he was being exceptionally silly.  He asked why I was watching the David Lynch version of  Dune  on the Sci Fi channel.  I replied, "Because I can."  I had just been flipping channels, but I just wanted to watch it through from that point.  However, I need to rent the movie and and watch the whole thing one day.  Ironically, the Sci Fi Channel showed a very good miniseries of  Dune  a couple of years ago.  I did some ironing tonight while I watched  The Go-Go's: Live At The Greek .  Boy, 1984 seems just like yesterday.  Jane Wiedlin looked perturbed a lot.  I guess it was the same time she was planning to leave the band for a solo career so she could finally sing her own damn songs.  Afterwards, I went online to see if I could find the video for  Totally Go-Go's , which is a much better concert.  I found three, but they were of dubious quality.  Before Bananarama, there was the Go-Go's.  I've almost finished the weblog book and then I will move onto the book on how to host a salon.  The DSL modem arrived today... at my former job.  Why?  I don't know.  I did not give them that address.  I wasn't asked either.  I guess I'll try to go by and get it tomorrow.  D. came by today.  He's a pretty courageous guy.  After many years, he is finally embracing recovery from alcohol and prescription drugs.  He made a close friend with another guy at the group.  They went to movies and played sports together.  They guy called him on Friday to tell D. that he loved him like a brother.  A few days later, D. went to pick up his friend to take him to their support meeting.  Come to find out, the guy shot and killed himself.  He had been struggling with depression.  If you have a moment, have a kind thought for him.

       LONELINESS IS NOT WRITING ENOUGH   It was icy and cold this morning.  Jeffifer had hoped that it might snow or sleet so that we wouldn’t have to work today.  However, the gods dealt a meteorological snake eyes instead.  I arrived at work and waited for Robert.  We were starting the big program today.  He arrived after the time we were supposed to start, but he had a lot of good leads that had occurred over the weekend and we followed up on them.  Robert gave me direction and I responded in a different way.  Instead of feeling like I was being ordered, I approached it more from the viewpoint of helping Robert out.    At lunch time I took off alone to run errands.  In reality, I just wanted to take some time to be by myself and read Julia Cameron’s The Right To Write.  She writes about different areas of writing and then there is a short writing exercise at the end of each chapter.  I’ve been working on this book for over a year.  (Can you say resistance?)  Julia says that when she feels lonely it is because she did not write enough the day before.  At first, this seemed a bit daft for me to accept.  It’s like saying that your anus closed up because you didn’t spin around three times counter-clockwise before you left the house this morning.  However, she went on to elaborate that when we don’t write enough, we have stopped the divine expression through us and we are not letting our true nature out.  The loneliness stems from this phenomena.  Ironically, I cannot remember the last time I was lonely and I know I’m not writing enough.  After lunch, I received a call from J.H.’s office from a new client.  I pre-qualified him for a loan and called him back for some additional information.  It’s really neat to be able to do some great things for people.  Carol Lynn, the Big Kahuna, told us that we are not charging enough for our services and we need to begin to realize that we provide a valuable service.  We replied that we are just starting out and struggling to get deals.  Being the wise woman she is, she reminded us that the deals are starting to come in more frequently and we should adjust our pricing accordingly.  “Just because you charge what you’re worth doesn’t mean your ripping the customer off.”  She is right, of course.    As I drove to the gym tonight, it occurred to me that a lot of my creative visualization has paid off.  It’s amazing how repeating affirmations, or a writing an ideal scene of how I would like my life to be or making a visual treasure map of what I want to manifest and focusing on it for a few minutes a day can actually produce results.  I will say that none of it happened overnight and some things happened in surprising ways that were different from what I had anticipated, yet the essence of what I wanted to achieve was essentially the same.  We’re going to submit four loans this week and after doing okay financially for the past eight months, I believe that I’m actually going to start seeing some good money come in.  I can’t wait to pay off my student loans and be completely debt free.  I’m very lucky that they are the only liabilities I have.  I’d also like to buy a professional quality digital SLR.  I’ve quite playing with my camera because I just don’t have the patience for developing film.  2F’s told me that I should go to bed by midnight.  I don’t like sleeping.  It is such a waste of time.  I’d prefer to be much more productive.  I’m really not that fond of eating either.  It would be so much easier if you could just take a pill for each meal and be done with it.  I wouldn’t have to cook or wash dishes or go to the grocery store.  What a wonderful world it would be!  2F’s and I had a conversation about how odd it is that I’m such a creative person, yet I don’t remember my own dreams.  He told me that with discipline and patience, I too, can remember my dreams.  I told him I knew about this, but it seemed of little value.  I haven’t dreamed about sex or flying in years.  The few dreams I remembered usually involved tedious tasks like organizing the spice rack at the white house or hand washing Madonna’s lingerie.  Why bother?  My sister called me tonight to thank me for calling and wishing her a happy birthday via my mom who was babysitting my niece at the time.  Evidently my niece would not quite playing games until both she and my mother were on the brink of starvation and my father had to come to the rescue with What-A-Burgers.  After the feast, he fell asleep next to the gas fireplace and snored.  My niece wanted juice so my sister told her to have some Hi-C.  My niece argued that it was not juice.  I had to agree with her.  In middle school and high school, we were not allowed to have soft drinks.  We could only buy these gross Hi-C drinks in a can that were ironically manufactured by Coca-Cola.  Considering that juice is basically just sugar, is there any nutritional difference between genetically altered juices and soft drinks?  Speaking of sodas, I told my sister about 2F’s obsession with my soft drink consumption.  It started about a year ago, but every time I pop a can open, he stares at me like I’ve broken into a parked car to steal a radio to sell for crack.  I have explained to him that I typically only drink a Diet Coke at lunch and dinner.  I drink 64 ounces of water around those times, but you would still think I am unable to go to the kitchen without an AA sponsor.  Oddly enough, I have found myself sometimes pouring a Diet Coke and then quickly taking the can to the recycling bin outside to erase any trace of my carbonated pleasure.  Yes, it sounds pathetic, but some days, I just don’t want to see the look.  By the way, things are going well on the South Beach Diet.  Surprisingly, I’m not craving processed foods at all.  I’ve been going to the gym regularly for the past two weeks and I no longer feel any soreness.  I can feel the workout in my muscles tonight.  My pectorals seem to be responding more quickly than normal, but my biceps and triceps just continue to taunt me.  Yes, they become toned, but never seem to grow in size.  I now know the pain of flat-chested women everywhere.  I finished Sex Toys Of The Gods last night.  I liked the ending.  I did not like Tricia, the anal-retentive agent’s assistant, at the beginning, but by the end of the book, I admired her plucky spirit.  Here is the link to the Web site of the author,  urlLink Christian McLaughlin .

       I ENJOY DIET COKE WITH A CUBAN ACCENT   Went to church early and read the Sunday paper while waiting to go in the sanctuary.  Nothing in the sales paper, but I did read an article about producer, Dallas Austin, donating $25,000 to a local school.  He produced Madonna's single,  Secret .  An African-American choir sang this morning and they had the most beautiful four part harmony.  Many people cried when they sang.  However, I thought they were pretty good.  Perhaps they were just emotional.  Damn that estrogen!  After the service, Joan, Merrideth, Bran and I went to lunch.  We ate at Garrison's because there was no wait and it was pretty good in the past.  Mirro, from Serbia, was our waiter.  He brought me a Diet Coke with a lime wedge.  It was absolutely delicious.  I could not get enough of it.  Our food must have taken over an hour, but my chicken Ceasar salad was very delicious once it arrived.  We usually have slow service when I have a very tight time schedule for the rest of the day.  Sundays just fly by it seems.  I went to Kroger and Publix looking for safflower oil so that we could make the Japanese asparagus dish for tonight's Cinematherapy.  What is Cinematherapy you ask?  A group of neighbors and Jeffifer (2F's and myself), get together one Sunday evening a month for a potluck and to watch a movie.  Pat hosted the event tonight and thought it would be fun to have a Japanese theme.  I finally found the safflower oil at Wholefoods.  By the time arrived home, it was time to make the dish.  So much for writing this afternoon.  Cinematherapy was fun tonight.  I don't own any Japanese clothing so I was going to wear my red plaide bathrobe.  However, I opted instead for some Banana Republic jeans, chocolate wool sweater and a pair of smart black shoes.  I was the apotheois of Japanese minimalism.  We ate and had a lively discussion about gay (I still can't believe it is such a hote issue in our presidential election) marriage and the new Georgia Scientific cirriculum that omits the word "evolution" on purpose.  Instead, we just "biologically changed over time."  As if my friends from Europe asking me about the state flag business was not embarrasing enough when Sonny Perdue was elected.  We watched Akira Kurosawa's  Dreams .  It's about eight dreams this Japanese director actually had.  It was kind of slow, but beautiful to watch.  We cracked jokes a lot.  Joan had a surprise for me today.  She showed me a postcard that I had sent her, which was dated June 7, 1996.  I had just moved to Atlanta from Dallas three weeks earlier.  I told her that I had found an apartment in Marietta with a guy named Mike and his overly dramatic dog, Doshi.  I had applied with several temp agencies and was waiting to hear back about a claims analyst position with John Hancock, soon to be UNICARE.  I mentioned something about having lunch with 2F's at McDonalds.  He said grace and thanked God for bringing me into his life and helping our friendship to grow.    As I was thinking about the postcard later while driving home from the grocery store, I remembered a time a few months after the postcard had been written.  I was somewhat torn about moving to Atlanta because I did not want to be so far away from Kent.  He had become quite ill and had moved home with his mother.  He looked bad and had wasted away quite a bit.  I had a dream one night that he needed my help.  It was so vivid that I woke up in the middle of the night and I was tempted to call him.  I made a note to call him from the office the next day.  When I arrived at work the next morning, there was a voice mail message on my phone from Kent.  He called to say that he missed me and just wanted to know if I would come home if he died.

       LOST IN TRANSLATION   We went to dinner tonight at Murphy’s in Virginia Highlands and planned to see  Lost In Translation  afterwards.  I was frustrated with 2F’s because I told him we needed to be at the restaurant by 7pm and he didn’t get into the shower until 6:45pm.  He acted as if it was no big deal to keep Donald & Julie waiting.  If the shoe was on the other foot, I would receive a judgmental diatribe that I would have to end abruptly with two choice words.    Parking is always a challenge in the Highlands so we parked about four blocks away.  I was still feeling angry on the inside, but trying to be friendly on the outside.  2F’s was oblivious.  We were inside the restaurant and 2F’s tells me to go check our reservations.  Julie had called and made a reservation for four under my last name and I had called and made a reservation for four under my first name.  Clearing this mix up was almost lost in translation, but finally resolved.  Someone tapped me on the shoulder.  It was Troy from our neighborhood.  I was still struggling with my inner rage and was trying to be friendly.  His partner, Todd, came in and said hello and walked off.  We had all gone to the movies almost a year ago and had a really great time.  In fact, I was looking forward to getting to know them better.  I ran into them at a restaurant once and said hello and they just walked on by.  Granted, I don’t know what was going on inside them at the time, but I at least make the effort of being friendly.    There is a line from the movie where Bill Murray’s character describes what it’s like to grow older.  You begin to realize what you want and you don’t care what other people think.  I’m tired of dealing with the bi-polar swings of other people.  From now on I think I will just do and say exactly what I think.  What’s wrong with letting people know you feel pissed on the inside at the moment?  It’s how I feel.  I want to people to see my dark, immature, dangerous side as well as the loving, devil-may-care, laid back side.  It’s real.  It’s sexy.  It’s me.  I related to Scarlett Johansen’s character the most.  So much of my life I have felt like a stranger in a strange land.  I’ve wanted to reach out and connect with other people without knowing quite how.  Sometimes I have stumbled and done it badly.  Other times I have done so quite eloquently and still did not achieve the imagined result.  In the earlier part of my life, I had wanted a boyfriend so badly.  I never could find the right fit.  Now I have the perfect boyfriend, but I’ve realized that perhaps what I was searching for was more of a kindred spirit than a partner.    Kent was my best friend growing up.  I had known him since I was 13.  We could have fun doing anything.  We could complete each other’s sentences and others often thought we were lovers, which we were not.  We communicated on so many different levels besides words.  We understood one another… and I’ve never really experienced that again.  I miss having a best friend.  I miss Kent.  I wish that night had never happened and I wish he had never bought that gun.  Scarlett Johanson favors Jeff’s wife, Kim.  When they visited us last summer, Kim and I connected on a very cool level.  The kids went to sleep early and all the Jef(f)s and Kim would sit around at night waxing on about things serious and not so serious.  One night, the boys went out by themselves and it was just Kim and I and we talked until we fell asleep.  It was so exciting.  It was like coming home, but yet I found myself holding back because I knew I needed to protect myself.  I knew as soon as they left, the magic would be gone and we would not be able to maintain the connection.  It was better to nip that euphoria in the bud so I would not be disappointed later.  Expectation is the child of the ego and almost uncontrollable.  It dances with disappointment on a regular basis.  I find I’m much happier if I don’t put expectations on other people.  Perhaps one day if I ever visit Jeff & Kim in Canada, Kim and I will expand upon that connection.  Then again, maybe not.  It will most likely be somewhat different because we will both be different people.  Will it be worse?  Will it be better?  Why not just let it be what it is?  I’ll take door number three, Bob!  We had a great time tonight with Donald and Julie.  They are absolutely two of my favorite people in the world.  We always have the most interesting conversations.  There is still a lot that I don’t know about them, but they seem like the kind of people who prefer to reveal their different layers in time.  I respect that.  Ironically, I have always been someone who wants to know everything about my friends immediately.  Perhaps that is why they came into my life; I have been gifted with the mystery of patience.  2F’s reached out and took my hand during the movie.  I like holding hands.  He has big hands, but they are soft and comforting.  They always make me feel that everything will be alright.  Today while hanging up laundry I found a magnetic dart board set that I bought for myself at Restoration while Christmas shopping.  I had always wanted a dart board ever since I read that Keren Woodward from Bananarama has one in her kitchen.  I opened it for the first time and looked at it.  I smiled to myself and thought, “I never have time to play games.”  Correction: I never make time to play games.  Rebecca Blood stated that one of the reasons people keep a weblog is for self-expression, and in doing so, they gain greater clarity in their thinking.  I believe she is right.  One thing that I have realized over the past few months is that this blog is for me… and not anyone else.

       LOVE YOUR ENEMIES   I'm currently reading  The Quest For Wholeness  by Robert Brumet for a class at church.  I was reading the chapter on forgiveness tonight when the author brought up Matthew 5:43-44.   "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."   I thought the timing was interesting when you consider that SR 595 passed this evening.  I noted the wisdom in the text with grumpiness and continued reading.  Then the author stated we need to look at what we mean when we say  enemy .  I found this an unusual approach.  His definition of an enemy is someone who threatens us in some way.  We will usually think first of someone who may try to hurt us physically, but how often do we encounter physical violence in our interactions with others?  No too often, but here is where it gets intersesting.  The author goes on to state that our real enemies are those who threaten our self-images and our belief systems.  I stopped after I read it and then reread it several times to let it sink it.  If someone threatens to harm us physically, we can take action.  We can call the police.  We can lock our door.  We can get a gun.  We can hit first.  If someone is messing with how we see ourselves and what we believe, it appears to be more difficult to protect ourselves.  Our sense of self or personality or ego consists of a particular set of mental images and related feelings.  This is who we think we are and and the way it should be.  The people who are up at arms about gay marriage are not afraid of us physically harming them.  They do feel a threat, but it is a threat to their ego and their sense of self.  A legally recognized union between two members of the same sex with all the same rights as a marriage does not compute, therefore, their ego immediately goes, "Danger Will Robinson!"  I know this may sound simplistic, and I know I understood it on an intellectual level in a broader theory, but tonight I understood it on a more emotional or personal level.  Mye ego was rocked and I listend and I took note.  Comments?

       GHOST TOWN   My friend, Steve, sent me this link to the  urlLink Ghost Town  site.  It's about a female motorcylist who rode through the Chernobyl area.  By the way, Mabeline Samples won her match.  The pics sent Steve were so funny, I almost swallowed my tongue.  I had never seen a pink goatee before.  Perhaps I should grow my goatee back, but then I would have to cut my hair short again.  Trust me!

       H2OH!   I've made it a point to drink more water.  It's good for you.  It flushes out your kidneys, gives you good skin and every ten minutes I feel like all the Buckhead ladies race to the shoe deparment in my bladder for a March Madness sale.  I thought I would adjust after a month, but I'm this close to a catheder.  One of the rules that I read is that you should always try to make sure that your urine is clear.  I was thinking about combining that with one of those quizes that Adam, Eric and Troy are always enticing me with.  My quiz would be "What's Unique About Your Urine?" If it's clear, you have trouble committing, but you're fun at parties and very self-aware.  If your a medium lemonade color, you're a fine balance between cuddly and kinky.  You're as much at home on a bed of roses as you are on a bed of nails.  You enjoy people, but you like your alone time too.  You should avoid artichokes or risk a head injury.  Dark yellow is a lone wolf.  You don't get out much and you don't care for small talk.  You have an impressive DVD collection and right hand with a cultivated grip.  Hmmm... maybe not.

       SR 595    Well kids, I just heard from Deep Throat and the Georgia House passed the ban on gay marriage by three votes.  It will be on the ballot in November.  It's very disconcerting.  I expect that the good citizens of the State of Georgia will vote for it and then we will all end up complaining about how it has affected all of our lives much like some of the teachers I know had a rude awakening once Governor Sonny started doing things they didn't like.  Never vote a good governor out of office out of spite. Hopefully, this new legislation will say something about tying a rope around the testicles of adulterous legislatures and the other end around the trailer hitch of a monster truck peeling out of the parking lot rapidly.  There, now I feel better.

       JUST THINK   My friend, Paul, sent me this.  I don't know who wrote it, but it's very well written and very clever... even if you beg to differ with the last sentence.   It started out innocently enough.  I began to think at parties now and then...just to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.  I began to think alone -- "to relax," I told myself -- but I knew it wasn't true.  Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and working don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself. I began to avoid friends at  lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, "What is  it exactly we are doing here?"  Things weren't going so great at home either.  One evening I had turnedoff the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's.  I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker.  One day the boss called me  in.   He said, "Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem.  If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job." This gave me a lot to think about.  I came home early after my conversation with the boss. "Honey," I confessed, "I've been thinking..." "I know you've been thinking," She snapped "and I want a divorce!"  "But Honey, surely it's not that serious." "It is serious,"  She added, lower lip aquiver.  "You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if  you keep on thinking we won't have any money!" "That's a faulty syllogism," I said impatiently, and she began to cry.  I'd had enough.  "I'm going to the library," I snarled as I stomped out   the door. I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with NPR on  the radio.  I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big  glass doors ... they didn't open.  The library was closed.  To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.  As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for  Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye.  "Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?" it asked. Most of  you no doubt recognize that line.  It comes from the standard Thinker's  Anonymous poster.  Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker.  I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a noneducational video; last week it was "Porky's."  Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.  I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home.   Life just seemed ... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.  Soon, I will be able to vote Republican.

       CULT OF JEF IS MOVING   Yes, I finally did it.  I registered my domain name and found some Web hosting.  Watch this space for details.  When I went to add my guest map, I found a nice little package at EasySite that was custom-tailored for me.  Woohoo!  I plan to move the archives over to the new Web site once I have designed the new site.  I'm planning to do it in Flash and finally put my Web design degree to use.  I was so sick of pixels after I graduated, but now time has healed those wounds.  I also want to include some of my photography and more of my writing.  Maybe I will finally do something with my other domain names too.  Hmmm....

       PEER PRESSURE   I have finally subcumbed to the numerous requests I have received to put a guest map on my blog.  It's on the left side at the very bottom.  Please select a push pin and place it on your locaiton on the map.  It takes about ten seconds for those with high IQ's and a little bit more for people who need to read everything.  I am especially interested in people from Australia and Iceland.  If I don't receive any, I may ask for an Australian for Christmas.

       CLUB KIDS   In 1995 I wrote several short screenplays while I was in Dallas in hopes of producing some short videos to play in some of the clubs on Cedar Springs.  Unfortunatley, nothing ever happend, but I have come across several of the scripts.  This script was based upon some kids that I stood in line behind to get into the Village Station one Thursday night.  I was in my mid 20's.  I haven't edited it. I hope you enjoy it.  	SCENE 1  INT.  DANCE CLUB  JUSTIN & BOBBY are standing around the Village Station drinking and smoking cigarettes.  We hear loud dance music. 	Justin. Ooh... I love this song.  They're my favorite group.  Who is this Bobby?  	Bobby. I don't know.  	Justin. God, I love this song.  I mean, I think it's so cool that someone can sum up the whole oppression of the Japanese tuna fisherman by dolphin loving activists.  	Bobby. Where do you get that?  	Justin. The lyrics, man, the lyrics...  	Bobby. I didn't know this song had any words.  I thought it was just music, you know.  	Justin. Well it has one.  "Baby, baby, you gotta let me go."  	Bobby. Oh, now I get it.  That is so deep.  I think I would cry if I had any feeling in my eyeballs, but they're numb.  	Justin.   Look, here comes Crystal.  	Crystal.   Hi, Justin.  	Justin. Hey, Crystal.  You know Bobby, don't you?  	Crystal. Oh, yeah.  You're the guy who threw up in my toilet nine times.  	Bobby. I had so much fun that night.  I wish I could remember it.  	Crystal.  This is my friend, Kirstin.  She works with me at the Gap.  	Justin & Bobby. Hey Kirstin.  	Kirstin.  Hey.  (To Justin.)  Oh, I love your hair.  	Justin. Thanks.  I was a hair model this weekend.  I really like your hair too.  	Kirstin. No, you don't.    	Justin. Yes, I do.  	Kirstin. No, you're just saying that.  	Justin.   No, I really, really, really, really, really do.  	Kirstin. Thank you.  	Justin. It's not that stringy, slut look like you see on most of the girls who work at the Gap.  	Kirstin. Well you know the Gap is really, really changing its image.  It's really getting cutting edge.  	Justin. No way.  	Kirstin. Yes way.  	Justin. You know, I've been thinking about getting a part time job there.  What's it like working at the Gap?  	Kirstin. Well, I know it looks like a lot of fun... and it is, but it's a lot of really hard work too.  	Justin. Really?  What do you have to do?  	Kirstin. Well, you have to stand around the store and smile and greet people and like ask them how they're doing and stuff.  And sometimes they ask you if you have a particular size.  	Justin. No.  	Kirstin. Yes.  	Justin. So what do you do?  	Kirstin. I go to the back and make a phone call to a friend.  Then I come out and tell them we don't have that size, but they might check one of our other Gap locations at another mall.  	Justin. Ooh... that's too much work.  	Kirstin. And you have to fold a lot too.  Last Saturday I had to fold until I thought I would go insane or... I don't know... drool or something.  But my assistant manager, Kym... she said they were the best three shirts I have ever folded.  	Crystal. People think it's such an easy job, but the Gap is really a challenging career opportunity, but it's an intense folding experience.  	Kirstin. I heard this girl at Valley View went insane folding.  She's in an asylum now and sometimes she eats bugs.  	Crystal. Eeeyuuuu!  	Bobby. Hey, isn't that Philip?  	 	Crystal. Oh - my - God.  It is.  	 	Kirstin. Is he still with Laurel?  	Crystal. Yes and I feel so sorry for her.  	Kirstin. Why?  	Justin. Philip can't make up his mind whether he's gay or straight.  	Crystal. He keeps going back and forth between Laurel and his roommate Brice... and he's tearing her apart.  	Justin. I guess that's the tragedy of being a teenage model.  When you look that good, you always have to compensate somewhere else in your life.  	Kirstin. You know, I've never met any happy, beautiful people.  	Bobby. I don't know.  What about Jackie Kennedy?  	Crystal. Oh please!  Her husband cheated on her with Marilyn Monroe.  It's a good thing someone shot him before she did.  	Bobby.   I like it when they call her Jackie O.  I love the sound of that.  I mean I could say it all day long.  Jackie O.  Jackie O.  	Justin. Well, she may not have been happy, but damn it, she always looked good. I always say if you can't be happy, by God, look good.  	Bobby. I think I'll name my dog Jackie O.  I mean if I ever get a dog.  If I already had a dog, it would already have a name naturally and if I started calling it Jackie O, he might become confused and suicidal.  I just couldn't handle my dog committing suicide.  If he did, I'd probably... I don't know... kill myself or something.  If I had a dog.  	Justin. Did you study for the Geometry test tomorrow?  	Crystal No.  I thought I would just copy off of you.  	Justin. No.  I was going to copy off of you.  	Crystal. Oh my god.  What are we going to do?  	Justin. Well... I know that vertical angles are always congruent.  	Crystal. God, how can you remember those things.  Isn't that hard being so smart?  	Justin. I don't know.  Sometimes things just get stuck on a brain wrinkle or something.  	Crystal. I don't understand why we have to memorize all that stuff.  The other day when you were sick, Mr. Tatum asked me to solve a proof and I was just like "So.  Who cares?"  	Justin. If I don't get at least a "C", my mother will have a total shit fit and ground me for good.  God, my mother is such a bitch.  	Crystal. No, my mother is such a bitch.  	Kirstin. No, my mother is such a bitch.  	Bobby. I wish I had known my mother.  	Kirstin. Oh my god, how sad.  Did she die or something?  	Bobby. No, I'm adopted.  	Crystal. Oh, how sad.  	Justin. I never knew that.  When did you find out?  	Bobby.  The other day... I wouldn't let my little brother change the channel on the TV and he told me. 	 	Crystal. Oh my god, my sister told me the same thing.  I must be adopted too.    	Justin. Oh look, there's that really cute guy.  	Kirstin. Where?  	Justin. Don't look.    	Kirstin. Why don't you go talk to him?  	Justin. I can't do that.  	Kirstin. Why not?  	Justin. He might not like me.  	Kirstin. Why wouldn't he like you? 	Justin. Do you think I'm cute?  	Kirstin. Well, yeah you're very cute.    	 	Justin. Would you go to bed with me?  	Kirstin. No.  	Justin. Why not?  	 	Kirstin. You're gay... remember?  	Justin. Don't say that word?  I'm not gay.  I'm just at that experimental stage in my life.  I'm going to be a writer, you know.  I mean I am a writer.  	Kirstin. Well go talk to him.    	Justin. I don't know.  	Kirstin. Here, I'll go with you.  	Justin. Okay.  JUSTIN & KIRSTIN exit.  	Crystal. I think Justin is so cute.   	Bobby. To die for.  	Crystal. Can I tell you something really, really, really personal?  	Bobby. Sure.  	Crystal. But you have to promise to never tell anyone... even under the threat of death because I plan on being even more famous than Madonna and the national tabloids can be ruthless.  	Bobby. I promise.  	Crystal. (Leaning close.)  Sometimes I fantasize about what it would be like to have Justin inside me.  	Bobby. Really?  Me too.  CRYSTAL & BOBBY both grab one another and squeal as they jump up and down.  KIRSTIN returns.  	Kirstin. I don't know what Justin was so worried about.  That guy really, really likes him.  Just look at the way he is falling all over Justin.  	Crystal. It looks like he's drunk.  	Kirstin. No, he really, really likes Justin.  	Crystal.  I think I'm going to go request Madonna.  	Kirstin. I think she is so pretty, but I like her better blonde.  What's your favorite hair color?  	Crystal. I don't know.  I kind of like dark and short like in that Rain video.  It almost makes me want to experiment with that lesbian side of myself.   	Kirstin. Isn't that interesting.  Oh by the way, I can't spend the night at your house Friday.  Something's come up.  What do you think Bobby?  BOBBY thinks and begins to have rapid eye movements and becomes very upset.  CRYSTAL hits him hard on the back of the head.  	Crystal. Stop it!  	Bobby. Oh it was awful.  All of a sudden I saw images from the Borderline video and then Like A Virgin and then Express Yourself.  I mean there were just so many of them.  JUSTIN returns with DAVID.  	Justin. Hey, I want you to meet my new boyfriend.  We are deeply and madly in love forever.  What was your name again?  DAVID goes blank and pulls out his wallet.  He looks at his driver's license.   	David. David. 	 	Crystal. It's nice to meet you David.  You seem like a really cool dude.  	David. Thanks.  	Kirstin. I think I'm going to go to the bar and get a drink.  Would you like something David?  DAVID collapses onto floor.  	Kirstin. Guess not.  KIRSTIN leaves.  	Justin. Do you think he's dead?  	Crystal. I don't know.  Quick step over here.  Maybe no one saw you together.  If you stand too close, people might take it as a reflection on you.  	Justin. What am I going to do?  This is so unfair.  Every time I get a boyfriend, they just die on me.  	Crystal. Well how many have you had?  	Justin. Just uh... well whatever his name was.  I really loved him though, Crys.  	Crystal. It's okay.  There will be another one.  Suddenly KEITH approaches JUSTIN.  	Keith. Hi.  My name is Keith and I couldn't help noticing that fantastic smile of yours from across the dance floor.  I was wondering if you would like to break some sodomy laws together by placing various external body parts into various well-lubricated orifices.  CRYSTAL, BOBBY & JUSTIN all act shocked.  	Justin. Uh... I don't think so.  	Crystal. Move on mister.  KEITH walks away, but suddenly JUSTIN stops him.  	Justin. Just a second... there's one more thing I'd like to tell you.  JUSTIN walks over to KEITH and whispers in his ear.  	Justin. Meet me out back in the parking lot in about twenty minutes.  KEITH nods.  JUSTIN goes back to the gang.  	Crystal. You tell him Justin.  Hey, let's go dance.  	Bobby.  Okay.  They all leave to go dance.  FADE TO BLACK.

       WHY AM I STILL AWAKE?   When you are a creative person, you sometimes find that your mind is like a toilet that runs.  No matter how much you jiggle the chain, and believe me, I can jiggle a chain like nobody's business, the water just keeps on running in the toilet.  I recently bought a copy of All Saints greatest hits album called  All Hits .  In case you don't remember, they were the edgey Spice Girls who were popular back in 1998.  As far as I can remember, they released two singles in the U.S.:  I Know Where It's At , which didn't do much for me; and  Never Ever , which I never heard until recently.  I like Never Ever.  It's sort of bluesy.  I could see some one singing this in a bar.  My favorite song on the album is  Pure Shores , which was from the movie The Beach.  It was written by William Orbit who produced Madonna's  Ray Of Light  album.  However, the song that I am currently obsessed with is  Black Coffee .  It's very edgey in the beginning with the guitar.  It reminds me of somone coming off prozac and then the chorus is so melodic, like someone going on prozac.  Anyway, this has been in the Miata's CD player for awhile.  I found an orange, plastic bag in the pantry and it contained five of these chocolate covered wafer snacks that I brought back from Thailand in September of 1999.  I turned 32 in Bangkok that year and I sang One Night In Bangkok as we walked around.  We went to 2F's first gay bar there.  I was interested to see how different it would be on the other side of the world and what pieces of their culture would the Thai gays incorporate into their alternative night life.  Well, we walked in and they were playing Ricky Martin's  Livin' La Vida Loca  and they were showing some video footage of a drag queen on a float.  Two little boys who came up to our belt buckles hit on us.  It wasn't quite the first experience I wanted 2F's to have.  I was always telling him what good music they played in a gay bar and how much fun it is to go dancing.  I remember dancing to  That's What Love Can Do  by Boy Krazy from 1993, which was actually released in 1991 in the UK.  Anyway, 2F's and I ate some of those chocolate things. They were a little stale, but quite tasty.  I've been enjoying the  urlLink Beast Momma  blog lately.  I haven't kept up with everyone's blog on a daily basis since I've had so much work to do, but I try to catch up very few days.  I really enjoy Jaspreet's posts.  She has a very singular voice in her writing style and there is something fresh and almost innocent in her perspective.  Her posts are very introspective and not only reveal much about her character, but motivate me to turn within and examine myself.  I noticed last week that I was beginning to receive hits from a blog entitled  urlLink Complex Superior .  I checked it out for a few days to see what I thought about it and I find it interesting. The author is a writer himself and has written an interesting post about his parents' 30th wedding aniversary.  I paid bills tonight and attacked one of the last remaining stacks on my desk.  I'm learning to be ruthless with paper and not hold onto anything that may come in handy one day.  If I don't use it immediately, it's gone.  I'm sure that land fills everywhere are quaking in fear.  I rushed to get to my writers group tonight and no one was there.  I walked around the book store looking very conspicuous with two inches of copies of my work to share.  It gradually dawned on me that March has an extra week in it and my meeting is next Tuesday.  I felt sort of deflated because I had worked more on  Exfoliation  and was interested to get their feedback.  By the way, I'm approaching 20 pages with this story and I'm only about 2/3 through it.  I'm coming up on the most difficult part.  I'm really eager to finish it and move on to the treatment for my screenplay for the  2004 Perfect Pitch cCntest .  In addition to  Exfoliation , I brought copies of  Ten Years After The Honeymoon  to share.  As I reread the story, I wash shocked to discover how many typos were in in it.  I have reposted this post with my revisions.  I apologize for the typos.  I find that when I'm involved in my writing, I will leave out words, repeat entire sentences or even misspell words that I know how to spell.  My new flat panel monitor also makes the text very small and I can't always see exactly what I have typed without getting close the screen.  I can't seem to adjust the display adequately.   I looked at potential hosting for cultofjef.com, but haven't decided upon anything definite.  I'm having issues with Dotser.  Evidently they do not wish to have anyone contact them because their phone numbers and e-mail addressed do not work.  I'm looking forward to moving my blog to its own domain so I can put some of my Web design skills to work.  I went to school for two years to get the degree, I might as well use it.   I'm not sure if I'll do anything with boygeniusdesigns.com.  The pollen has been thick in the air and I feel as if my throat is stuffed with cotton.  I was reviewing some marketing material that Robert gave me.  The first manual I read was just a repeat of information from a seminar we went to a month ago.  I mentioned this to him and he became very defensive as if I was being critical when I was simply stating a fact.  I didn't even try to tell him that I wasn't being critical because it doesn't matter.  It just makes him more defensive.  I've learned to just get off the phone with him quickly, so I did.

       FIRST AID FOR A PHALLUS   A friend called this evening and we had the following conversation.   Hello?  I have a blister on my penis.  Rick?  It hurts when I touch myself.  Don't do that.  But what am I supposed to do?  Give it a rest.  For how long?  For as long as it takes to heal.  I'd better sit down.  How did this happen?  I don't know.  Were you masturbating with sandpaper again?  Ha.  Ha.  Very funny.  Are you sure it's not a genital wart?  Maybe you should have it looked at.  Hold on.... No, it's not a genital wart.  Are you looking at it now?  Yes, of course it's easier when I have an erection.  I really didn't need to know that.  Hold on.  I'm trying to get a better look.  What do you mean by that?  Hold on.  I'm thinking sexy thoughts.  No!  I do not want to be on the phone with you while you're trying to get a rise out of yourself.  That's way too lower Alabama for me.  It sort of looks like a small lima bean... or maybe a kidney.  Do you have any neosporin or other ointment to put on it?  I can't do that.  Earl wouldn't like the taste.  Just for the record, I believe it's poisnous as well.    What are you trying to do to Earl?  I don't have an insurance policy on him.  I'm just saying that maybe he could refrain from giving you oral sex until it heals.  I'm getting dizzy and not in a good way.  I don't feel like we're making any headway... no pun intended.  You know, I think Earl must have bit me in a fit of passion Sunday evening.  Not on the Sabath Day!  Stop it.  You never answered my question.  Do you have any ointment?  I do, but I don't think I can put it on myself.  Will you come over and do that for me?  You mean the world to me Rick, but I'm not going to rub an antibiotic on your penis. What about Earl?  Maybe y'all could incorporate it into some creative love making.    He's out of town the rest of the week.  Then why were you so upset about not having sex with Earl for a few days.  He could come home early.  I am bringing this conversation to a close.  You're annoyed with me, aren't you?  No.  Then tell me something nice about me.  I think it's really funny in a cool way that you're dating someone named Earl.  Yeah, that's cool, isn't it?  If only he worked in a garage.  Gotta go.  Bye!

       IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT   I woke up last night to the sound of rain falling gently on the roof.  For a moment, I feared the inside of the Miata being soaked, but then remembered putting the top up yesterday morning.  I listened to him breathing beside me and smiled.  I moved closer and fell back asleep to the duet of rain patter supported by his intake of oxygen and outflow of CO2.

       ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANANARAMA ANECDOTES   Sarah Dallin of Bananarama was once interviewed about her lifelong friendship with fellow member, Keren Woodward, on the set of the  I Heard A Rumour  video back in 1987.  Sarah recalled hitting Keren with a field hockey stick.  The journalist asked if she had been jealous of Keren or if it she had done something to provoke this action.  Sarah replied matter of factly, "No, I hated her. That's why I did it."  For some reason, I love this story.

       A QUICK POST   Today was a busy day.  I accomplished quite a bit.  My boss complimented me on a flyer that I put together and a letter I am sending to several companies around town for an affinity program.  I love to please that woman.  She is truly "fabulous."  Afterwards I worked out.  I bumped up the weight a bit and I'm doing more now than I ever have.  Why is the weight I'm doing today so easy when it was impossible almost a year ago.  It's exciting watching the changes in my body.  My stomach is flatter and firmer.  The obliques are looking good, but it will be another month or so before the six pack reveals itself.  My boss noticed that I had lost weight and asked what my special program.  I laughed.  Why is this all coming together now when I have had so-so success in the past?  Over the weekend, I took care of several things that have been haunting me on my list of unfinished business from last year.  Why was it so difficult before this weekend?  It was all so easy.  What changed in me to make it so?  In my  Quest  class, we are studying faith now.  There was one sentence where the author wrote that faith is seeing in Spirit.  Faith is seeing what is inherit in the situation before it is manifest or revealed.  It may happen in a second or years, but always in the perfect time and way.  For some reason, I feel like a whole new layer has been revealed to me in spiritual quest.  It's been there the whole time, but I'm only now comprehending.  Can we have faith if we don't believe in God?  Finally, I'm very involved in my short story,  Exfoliation .  It's turning out to be much longer than I had anticpated, but the main character is complicated.  He is unraveling and each paragraph is a thread of his character that reveals itself to me.  The story is writing itself.  I begin to wonder if readers will look at the characters and try to compare them to me.  There are pieces of me in each one, but not the larger sum of their actions.  It's exciting to see it all coming together on so many different levels.  I don't think that I wrote it really.  I simply transcribed it what is given to me.  It's so much bigger than me alone.

       ARTIST DATE   Went to church with 2F's this morning to listen to him sing.  Unfortunately, I couldn't seem to concentrate on the lyrics.  It was something to do with a rose and the crucifixtion.  Everyone kept weeping and telling me how wonderful it was.  I have no idea why I was so distracted.  Afterwards we went to the park and had a picnic lunch with his parents, nieces and his great nephew. I love the great nephew.  I have never met such a good natured kid with such a great personality.  He needs to be in commercials.  He's walking now and putting sentences together and just a ball to be around.  We played on the playground a bit.  I came back home and did some minor stuff on the car.  I checked the oil, changed the wiper blades, etc.  I did some things around the house.  I sat down and composed the short story that you see posted below this post.  I'm not really sure where it came from (no pun intended), but it just burst into my mind and I had a very strong need to write it down.  For the most part, I am satisfied with the results although I will probably look over it again in a few days and do some editing.  The short story is becoming my format of choice lately.  If you have ever read  The Artist Way  by Julia Cameron, you'll know that she she talks about scheduling a few hours each week to just spend time with yourself and do something fun.  I decided that I needed to do that this afternoon.  I've been working all weekend doing things around the house and I just wanted to get out.  I was going to wash the car first, but decided to go to Tower Records.  The weather was beautiful today and I enjoyed the sunshine and the wind blowing through my hand.  I listened to Yazz on the way to Buckhead and sang along to  The Only Way Is Up  and  Stand Up For Your Love Rights  and  Treat Me Good .  It's been a long time since I've gone into Tower Records and just looked at everything.  They had the k.d. lang live DVD on sale for ten bucks and I was very tempted.  I love that CD.  It has most of my favorite k. d. lang songs on it, but I decided to pass on it.  I'm not sure that I would watch it more than once.  I listened to the remixes for No Doubt's  It's My Life , which I have to say is a very good cover of the original version by Talk Talk from 1984, but the remixes don't really add much to it.  I passed on them.  I toyed with the cover of Tears For Fears  Mad World  from the  Danny Darko  soundtrack, but passed on it again.  I was hoping to find All Saints  Saints And Sinners  CD, but did not.  I've always liked Pure Shores and I just recently discovered Black Coffee.  I'm very intrigued.  So, I went to the bargain bin and I came home with a couple of great CD's that I was pleased with:   1 Giant Leap  by  urlLink 1 Giant Leap  - This is a cool album that combines well-known pop stars with lesser known musicians from around the world.   My Culture  featuring Robbie Williams and Maxi Jazz,  Braided Hair  featuring Speech and Neneh Cherry and  The Way You Dream  featuring Michael Stipe and Asha Bhosle are all stand-out tracks.  There is also a DVD, which I hear is very cool too, but that will wait until another day.    Woman To Woman  by Fem 2 Fem - This album was big back in 1993.  Well, the single  Switch  was popular in the clubs back in 1993.  It featured four lipstick lesbians who made the suggestion that women should switch from men to women.  I don't think all the girls, if any, were lesbians, but I believe that one was from Dallas.  The follow up single,  Obsession,  wasn't as successful.  They released a second album a year or two later and then disappeared as far as I know.   Switch  is a great club song and terrific to work out too.  However, it's best not to sing along with your headphones on.  Other people may get peeved at you saying, "Switch, you bitch!" out loud without knowing the whole story.   Spin  by Darren Hayes - This was sort of an experimental purchase.  I had never heard any of the songs before, but several people I knew liked it.  St range Relationship  didn't immediately grabe me.  I responded better to  Insatiable  and I really liked  Crush (1980 Me) , but I don't quite know what it's about yet.  I'm not sure how well this album did for the former lead singer of Savage Garden.  If I end up not liking it, I'll give it to my mom.  She's a Savage Garden fan.   Chupacabra  by Imani Coppola - I had been charmed by the infectious  Legend Of A Cowgirl  back in 1998 and bought the single, which I still play today.  This was another experimental purchase.  So far, I've been pleased.  I know very little about her, but she seems to have combined many musical styles in a blender and made a very nice aural smoothie.  Mmmm.... delicious!  I'm back home now.  The front door and back doors are open.  My bedroom window's open.  The temperature is perfect.  There is a slight breeze.  The air is heavy with the perfume from the wysteria growing outside above the deck.  The branches have grown intertwined with the deck and have created a lavender canopy.  Large bumblebees fly around all day busily working their bumblebutts off before the wyesteria goes out of bloom.  The dogwoods have bloomed too, but aren't in full bloom yet.  I'm proud of the cleaning that I've done this weekend.  Things look much neater and I feel more focused now that I'm not surrounded by clutter.  I'm going to heat up a hamburger patty from yesterday and eat some dinner.  Last night, 2F's made some tilapia and cous cous while I made a spinach salad.  We had some Italian bread too.  For dessert, we had the best tiramisu that I have ever had.  The piece was a wee bit too big, but the subtle coffee flavor is still on my mind.  Well, I must do my taxes now and send off some rebates.  Then I'm planning my goals for tomorrow and the rest of the week.

       TEN YEARS AFTER THE HONEYMOON   Selma looked closely at the multigrain toast as if she were searching for a cure for polio.  She brushed her finger over the many seeds in the bread, wondering exactly what they were.  She knew this type of bread was healthier for you, but she couldn't help wonder if she should swallow a few small pebbles to help grind up some of these large seeds in the bread in her stomach.  Selma took a bite, set the toast down and had some more coffee.  This was one of her favorite moments.  She liked waking up early and just having the morning to herself to drink coffee, read the paper and not have to talk to anyone.  She was shocked at first to realize that she had fallen into such a predictable habit, but it was one of the few things that she could actually control in her life.  Therefore, she enjoyed it.  She turned the page of the newspaper and began reading about a woman who saved from her homicidal ex-boyfriend by the heroic actions of her Chihuahua, Paco.  There was a close-up shot of the woman, a buxom sort with bleached hair, snuggling against a small, mouse-like face with eyes the size of saucers.  Selma looked down at Shelby, the greyhound that she and Roger had rescued.  Shelby lay on the hardwood floor in a patch of sunlight streaming through the window.  Her eyes were open and glassy as they stared off into space.  Shelby's tongue lay motionless out of her mouth.  Selma began to worry if she should go hold a mirror under her nose when the dog suddenly passed gas, wiggled about for a few seconds and then regained her macabre composure.  Selma had been contemplating tracing Shelby's body in chalk and roping the dog off with yellow crime tape to surprise Roger one morning, but so far she had not been motivated enough to do so.  Selma had married at 25.  Her mother told her she was too young nor had she known Roger long.  He was on leave from the Navy.  They had met in a bar called the Crow's Nest in Buckhead.  He had been in his sailor's uniform and she decided that if you were going to pick up a sailor and there were no docks within five hours, a bar called the Crow's Nest was the next best thing.  She bought him a shot.  He told her a joke.  They danced.  He bought her a drink and then another and another.  Before she knew it, they were eating breakfast at IHOP and then watching the sun rise in her SUV.  Roger wanted to have sex, but she said she'd rather wait.  He sighed, but said that he respected that.  He was glad she told him.  The next night she gave in.   She sometimes regretted it.  Roger seemed to have two ways of interacting with her.  The normal way was very familiar as if she was one of his buddies and the other was as if she were the most desirable porn star in the world.  He made love to her with the fierceness of an animal in heat and she contributed this to his time spent trapped on a submarine with a bunch of men.  She had asked him once if anything had ever happened between him and any of his buddies while they were out to sea for such a long period of time.  "You know, like you read about men in foxholes in WWII."  He looked at her as if she had just confessed that the secret ingredient to her vegetarian chili was a little menstrual blood and then turned his attention back to the television. She didn't pursue the subject.  On the day of her wedding, her mother came to her before the ceremony.  She smoothed out her wedding dress to make sure everything was perfect before looking into her eyes for what seemed like an eternity.  She thought her mother was going to say something to the effect of how her little girl had grown up, but instead she told Selma, "In the beginning of a marriage, the woman knows about compassion and not how to enjoy sex.  The man knows how to enjoy sex, but not about compassion.  Over the years, the man will teach the woman how to enjoy sex and her body and the woman will teach the man about compassion."  Her mother let out a long sigh.  This bit of wisdom had not been easy to share.  Then her mother kissed her, pulled her veil down over Selmas face and walked out of the room.  Selma turned the page of the newspaper again when she heard Roger's feet padding up behind her.  She felt the electricity from his body a millisecond before his big arms enfolded around her and he gave her a kiss on the cheek.    "Good morning, he said.    She looked up at him and smiled.  "I just made some coffee.  Do you want me to get you some?"    "No, I'll get it."  Roger walked around the table and into the kitchen.  He still had a great ass.  He had gained a little weight around the middle, but not as much as some.  He had a fairly large build so the love handles weren't much of a contrast.  It wasn't like their friends, Phil and Linda.  Last summer they went inner tubing near Helen and Selma had been shocked by how much difference ten pounds made on Phil's stick figure.  He looked like a boa constrictor that had swallowed a beach ball.    Roger carried his extra weight well.  He had a handsome face framed by a thick crown of unruly hair that could not even be tamed with super glue.  After all, she should know.  She had tried once when they were both very drunk.  Selma wondered what physical traits their child would inherit from Roger, but then stopped herself.  They had been trying for over a year now with no result and she felt like a stuck record.  She picked up her mug and took another sip of coffee to physically correct this thought pattern.  Instead she began to read about an elderly black gentleman who had recently decided to clean up his neighborhood with rake.  First, he had tackled the trash with the rake.  Next, he had physically beaten all the members of a street gang with it and single-handedly driven out the crack problem in his neighborhood.  Roger appeared in the doorway with coffee in one hand and three small powdered donuts in the other. There was a white smudge on his upper lip that implied that he had just snorted some cocaine through a $20 pill off a mirror in the kitchen.  He smiled at her.  "I really enjoyed last night."    She smiled and then said, "Yeah, me too."  She found herself becoming a bit flushed as her eyes gently floated down his torso like a leaf in the wind.  His chest hair grew in a funny shape.  It was like a tear drop standing on its head with the large portion being at the top in the valley between his nipples and coming to a sharp point just above his navel.  It gave the impression of large birth mark in the shape of a big exclamation mark.    "You know," he began.  "Sex has always been good, but last night was especially hot.  What was different about it?"    This took her off guard.  She looked blankly at him.  "We bathed?"    He pulled the chair out and sat down across from her.  "No, that's not it.  I don't recall us doing anything different, but last night just seemed really hot."  He popped the last donut into his mouth as she found herself becoming annoyed.  She just wanted to flip back a page and read about the Chihuahua.  She didnt want to think right now.  "A lot of my buddies complain that sex gets stale after five years or so, but I think our sex life is still pretty good.  Don't you?"    Selma looked up from her paper.  He wanted to talk serious just as Paco was going for the jugular.  "Yeah, I would agree with you.  I think we work at it though.  Unlike some of our friends, we plan dates and decide when we're going to have sex so we know to look forward to it.  We try to do new things like the French maid costume and the vibrator added a bit of fun."    "Yeah...."  He ran his finger along the rim of his coffee cup and stared out the window.  Thinking the coast was clear, she returned to her paper.  "What do you like best about sex with me?" He asked.  Selma's eyebrow arched above her left eye.    "What?"    "What do you like best about sex with me after all these years?"    She leaned back against the dining room chair and regarded him with skepticism.  What was this all about?  Was he on the diving board of his mid-life crisis about the jump into the waters of uncertainty head first?  She took a sip of coffee and gingerly answered.  "I appreciate the way you approach my breasts."    "How's that?"    "You don't handle them frantically and roughly as if you're a S.W.A.T. team member trying to diffuse a bomb or a dog trying to get a good hold on a ball in its mouth.  You handle them like you would as if you were woodworking.  You run your fingers along the edges with firmness, but yet also with care.  I appreciate that."    Roger made a little face with his mouth to consider her comment and then stared at the window again.  After a moment, Selma looked down at her newspaper again.  She was surprised to learn that Paco had survived the plunge through the plate glass window and down three stories to the rose garden by holding onto the ex-boyfriend's ear with her teeth the whole time.  Fortunately Bobs body had cushioned the blow for Paco, Bob had not been so lucky.  "I like being inside you."  Repressing a sigh, Selma looked up from the paper.  Roger was staring at her.  "I like being inside your wonderful magic place.  I like knowing that this warm, wet flesh of yours is surrounding the most vulnerable part of my body.  I like looking into your eyes as I'm pumping away into you because every time, I see something new.  I find a new part of you.  But after all these years, I think I know what I like best."    She looked into his brown eyes for a moment.  She didn't reach for her coffee, but asked him, "What is it then?  What do you like best?"    Roger leaned into her across the table.  "I like the way you hold me.  Last night when I came, you tightened your grip around me as if to say you'd never let me go.  I felt so completely loved by you.  I wondered if we were just satisfying our sexual needs or if we were creating a new life in that moment, a baby.  It moved me and I had tears came to my eyes.  I wiped them away because I was scared, but it's an extension of being inside you.  I like the way you make me feel okay to be vulnerable."    Tears began to roll quickly down her face.  Roger grabbed her hand in concern.  "I'm sorry baby."   "No, it's okay.  It's compassion, Roger.  You found compassion."    He sat back and thought about it for a moment.  "I guess I have."  There were many emotions flying around her in body: happiness; sadness; laughter; tears and suddenly the intense desire to have this man's baby.  She leaned forward and in a conspiratorial tone she whispered, "Meet me under the table, Roger."  His eyebrows rose up in a questioning manner.  "I'm in the mood for love."  Selma felt his hot kisses on her neck as she threw her head back in ecstasy just as Shelby passed gas again.  She could not be distracted.  She mentally willed her ovaries to give up an egg for their child.  With great concentration, she guided his sperm to her egg and fertilized it.  Roger looked deep into her eyes and turned the page to see another side of Selma.  When Roger closed his eyes and thrust into her pelvis with great effort, she strengthened her hold on him as if she would never let him go.  After a few moments, he laid his head on her chest and she noticed that were breathing in unison.  She ran her fingers lightly over his back and after some time, she realized he was sleeping.  She rocked her grown baby in her arms for awhile and for some reason she found tears flowing from her eyes again, but they were tears of joy.  Nine months later, Selma gave birth to a little boy who loved to be physically active, but also had a sensitive side that showed the biggest heart for others that she had every seen.  He was the perfect balance of compassion and something more.

       MY SECOND DREAM FROM LAST NIGHT   I'm at a dinner party.  I seem to know all the people, but I don't recognize anyone but Kristin Scott-Thomas and I'm wondering if I should bring up Under The Cherry Moon, which I enjoyed.  It's in a small room with lots of dark wood and books on the wall.  We have a delicious soup when I look to my right and I note that I'm seated next to Helena Bonham-Carter.  I look to my right and see a large, Zeus-like man dressed in long robs with white hair and a beard.  He's glowing slightlly and I realize that I'm seated next to God.  My heart stops and I'm suddenly very concerned about which fork to use.  I panic when I realize that we didn't even say grace before we ate.  We just dug right in.  I look up and realize that God doesn't seem to be concerned in the slightest.  In fact, he is happily chatting away with Pee Wee Herman and Carmen Electra.  I hear them involved in a passionate discourse on hydro-power.  I'm watching Pee Wee's hands at all times.  Then I find that we are suddenly mingling in a large ball room.  The number of people has quadrupled.  God approaches me, smiling.  "Do I make you uncomfortable, Jef?"  "No," I reply.  "You're everywhere anyway.  Why shouldn't you be here?"  Kristen Scott-Thomas walks up to me and says, "Jef, I see you have met my God."  I laugh and then correct her by saying, "Well, Kristen, you know there is really only one God."  She puts her arm around God in much the same way you see celebrities like Nicole Kidman paling around a movie premiere with Naomi Watts.  "No, this is my God.  Your God is over there."  She points behind me and I see that everyone has a different God beside them.  There are cowboy Gods, vengeful Gods, loving Gods, New Age Gods, heavy metal Gods, etc.  The only correlation seems to be that the vision of God seems to be directly related to His person.  In other words, a loving God is attached to a loving person.  A vengeful God stays close to an angry person.  I'm in the midst of information overload when a blonde Adonis approaches me.  He looks like a classical Greek statue come to life.  "  Hello, Jef."    "Uh, hi.  Are you my God?"  "Yes, I am."  "I think there has been a mix up.  You're supposed to be my God, not a god."  "But I am your God."  "No, you can't be.  I've always pictured God as a bright loving light not bright highlights.  You're too sexy to be my God.  It's distracting."  "Jef," he began putting his hand on my shoulder.  "Don't touch me!"  "Why not?"  "You're too sexy in this form.  I might respond to it physically and that would just totally short-circuit me psychologically."  "You can't see beyond the light.  Why is that?"  "I don't know."  "Yes, you do.  Think."  "I like the light better.  You have too much detail.  TOO MUCH!"  "Why does that bother you?"  "I don't want you to have that much detail. I'm more comfortable when you are more ambiguous."  "And more details means?"  I looked into his beautiful face and down his perfectly proportioned body.  "This is too personal.  This is too close."  "Haven't you been trying to cultivate a personal relationship with me?"  I looked into his eyes.  "I think I know what you're saying, but I can't put it into words."  He nodded at me.  The fear was gone.  My anxiety of being aroused by God was gone.  I just felt love and peace and then I woke up.  This has to be the weirdest dream ever.  I don't even like Kristen Scott-Thomas.  The dream stayed with me though.  After I woke up, I still had that same sense of peace about me.  The gym is going to be very weird today.  Most of all, there is a feeling of being unable to express in words the message that I received.  Maybe it's so personal, it can't be explained.

       ETHINTICITY ETHICS   This started out as a random thought that just took off and ran with itself much further than I had anticipated.  I can't say that I offer a conclusion or solution, just my thoughts.  With more and more people from Central and South America immigrating to the U.S., it has become apparent to me that one must be careful in assuming ethniticity.  Some people from this background do not like the term Hispanic.  Obviously, you do not want to refer to someone from South America as a Mexican American.  Calling them A South American American would be confusing.  Typically, the prefer to be referred to as Latin American since South America is sometimes referred to as Latin America.  However, a friend of mine from Cuba does not like to be called Latin American because her cultural background is very different from Latin American.  She is a Cuban American, which seems more of a nationality than ethniticy.  It also sounds like a tasty drink that knocks you on your ass.  Still, when I complete a loan application the government requires that I note whether or not someone is of Hispanic orgin or not even if the customer chooses to pass on providing this information.  The purpose is to ensure that brokers do not discriminate.  This information is reported to the government and if your statistics show that every single client you worked with is caucasion, something is up.    I don't generally refer to someone's race unless they bring it up.  I remember being asked to point out a co-worker when I worked at Target.  I tried to identify him in every way without saying he was black.  Finally after 45 seconds, the customer asked, "Is he the black one?"  I closed my eyes and nodded.  Perhaps I was just being too self-conscious, but I felt that such a term was marginalizing him.  I wouldn't have wanted to someone refer to me as the gay one.  Granted, if someone saw me on the street they are not going to pick me out as the gay one.  You can't tell by the color of my skin or the way I walk or talk.  Now if I kissed another man or took it further or was wearing a rainbow flag, then you might have more information to identify me that way.    I focus on the individual as a whole and the color of their skin is only a small portion of who they are, not the whole.  My sexuality is only a small part of who I am, not the whole of my being. However, my sexuality is more than a box that is checked on an application to fit in me into all applicable categories.  My sexuality permeates the rest of my life.  It determines what films I choose to watch, the music I choose to listen to, the clothes I choose to wear and my politics.  Granted, I might find mutual ground with a heterosexual housewife, but there will probably be a homosexual filter attached to it.  "Oh no, not ice cream.  Sorbet."  Well, maybe not from me, but you can see my point.  For an African American, who they are is more than just the color of their skin.  I have known caucasions that grew up in predominantly black neighborhoods whose cultural backgrounds more resenbled that of blacks than of whites.  Black is so much easier to say than African American like white is easer to say than caucasion.  I hate the word negroe.  It just sounds so... so... unpalatable to me.  And the term nigger just makes me nautious, which is interesting since I am so white that when I first wear shorts in the summertime, people have to wear sunglasses to prevent blindness.  However, when my grandmother grew up in the South during the 20's and 30's, whites referred to most black people as the nigger woman who does my washing, etc.  There was no malice or hate behind the word like there was in the 60's during the Civil Rights Movement.  Fortunately, I don't hear that word much these days except when I hear to African Americans use it with each other.  I don't get it.  Why would you want to use a word that has so much hatred behind it.  It's like keeping it alive to me.  I don't call any of my gay friends, fudge packer or rump ranger as a term of affection.  Interestingly enough, words like faggot and queer, which were once used in a hateful way have now been embraced by some peope in the gay community as a way to empower themselves.  In other words, you can't hurt me if I turn the hate behind those words into self-respect and pride.    So what does this mean?  How come I'm not a Caucasian American?  What do you call a black person from Britain?  African-Brit?  Would my friend, Honey, be an African-Jewish-Lesbian-Handicapped-American?  No.  To me she will always just be Honey.

       MY FIRST DREAM FROM LAST NIGHT   I don't normally remember my dreams unless I make a concerted effort before going to sleep and just after waking up, but I had two unusual ones last night.  In the first one, I had returned to work at Target.  It was a big, flashy Target that was located in a mansion with many floors and stair cases.  I remember being at the service desk where people make returns.  I was trying to help a Hispanic man who could not speak English.  His son was translating for us.  The son would not allow me to make copies of the man's driver's license and social security card, which I explained to him that I needed due to the Patriot Act.  The son would wave the information in front of my face.  He only wanted me to write down the numbers because he didn't feel safe letting me copy the cards. Alicia, a former co-worker from the insurance company said that she would write down the numbers.  I explained to her that was not sufficient per company policy and explained to the man that there was no protection in letting us write down the numbers instead of photocopying the information.  Eventually Alicia took over and I went upstairs.  The mansion suddenly turned into my church and there were many people there.  A luncheon seemed to be taking place and there were all these cater waiters with trays of little teeny-tiny desserts.  I don't mean like cookies or appetizers.  They were full seven-tier wedding cakes that were bite-size.  I had three and felt very guilty after the first one.  I could hear Joan's voice in my head saying that she was very disappointed that I had not shown up for the lunch.  I thought to myself, "But I was working."  I couldn't see Joan, but I knew that she was looking for Bran and Merrideth.  Suddenly I was on the stairs with Mark's cat, Sophia, except that she was gray instead of black.  I was carrying her in my arms and petting her in a rather Dr. Evil way.  I went downstairs and Target was gone.  There were big tables set up everywhere and there were 20 or 30 board games.  I intuited that I was in an office breakroom.  Then the cast of The Office showed up and I went upstairs.  I didn't want them to think I was a stalker.  I got a drink of water from a water fountain and I saw two young men approaching me from the other way.  One was on a bicycle.  For some reason, I didn't want these two to know who I was.  I looked down at the floor as they passed.  I turned and went down the stairs.  I knew they were bloggers with blogs that I sometimes read.  I knew I was in danger.  I heard the one on the bicyle say, "I'm looking for my scooby, Jef."  My heart froze.  It was Drew from Not Enough Drew In The World and I knew he was coming to take me, and possibly Sofia, away.  I moved down the stairs more quickly.  I heard the bike begin to move down the stairs as Drew said, "Here scobby, scooby, scooby!"  I broke into a run screaming, "But I'm not your scooby!  I'm not!  I hardly know you!"  Then I woke up.    I would just like for it to be noted that all I consumed before bed was a cup of filtered water.

       SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON MEDITATION   I meditate every morning for ten minutes before I start my day, longer if I have time.  It's my way of listening to God instead of always talking and telling him my demands.  Sometimes I receive information or feelings that I should do something.  For example, maybe someone will come to mind and I will feel compelled to call them.  Later that day, I call that person and we chat.  As we are getting off the phone, the person will say, "By the way, I've been meaning to call you.  I have a friend that needs to refinance," or "You know I was really feeling down, but you called and told me exactly what I need to hear."  It's funny how it works, but oh so cool.  This morning it was just a quiet feelig, but a very deep connection.  It's like being plugged into a current and feeling a steady stream of energy coursing into my being.  I feel at complete peace as if I could stay that way all day.  I lose all track of time like those people who are abducted by UFO's and have tests performed on them.    Some days it may be difficult to quiet the traffic in my head and I may not have a quiet feeling or receive any information.  It's like having a bad hair day.  It just happens and you don't know why and you just have to live with it for the time being.  I still sit for the whole time. The quality may not seem as good as the other days, but I think there is something going on anyway on a level that I don't understand or see.  I still have a better day with what I may perceive as low-fi meditation than if I don't meditate at all.    Just some thoughts I wanted to share with you.

       I THINK I'VE HEARD MY CALLING, BUT I WANT IT TO CALL BACK LATER   I know that some of my faithful readers are agnostic.  I won't name any names like Juan from Chile who wants to know how big my penis is.  (Obtenga una vida, mi amigo.)  I believe in a higher power.  I believe that divine intelligence was somehow involved with creating the little amoebas that split apart, walked on land and instigated all the mysteries in life that I do not understand like putting two Waffle Houses catty-corner at the same intersection.  I like to believe in God because otherwise it would mean that I'm it and that's a responsibility that I do not choose to accept thank you very much.  I have many experiences in my life that cannot be explained.  No, I haven't been drinking.  I'm talking about being a predicament and needing an answer or help and having only prayer left and then voila - the perfect solution came out of nowhere like Hollywood film.  It's the kind of experience that makes your skin tingle like a an astringent cleaner with an alcohol to water ratio of 99.9% to 00.1%.  Okay, I'm stalling.  This is sort of a weird post.  I don't know why I'm writing it at 12:59am in the morning, but I feel compelled to write it.  Marianne Williamson once said on one of her lecture tapes that if you feel like you have something you need to say, there is probably someone who needs to hear it.  Hopefully, it will be some lone soul surfing the Internet who comes across my blog and isn't blind.  Over the past few years I have had an impression of something that I needed to do.  I won't say that God told me to write a book because then you start imagining George Burns as God and I look nothing like John Denver.  In fact, I'm still a bit upset that no one even bothered to tell me that George Burns died.  All it would have taken is to call me up, say, "Jef, George Burns is dead.  I know.  Get over it!"  My mother once told me that she read that John Denver liked to mow his lawn in the nude.  I've never forgotten that.  I think of it whenever John Denver comes to mind.  Then I remember that John Denver and I had the same government teacher... Mrs. Marsh.  Of course, she taught John Denver at Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth and she taught me in Burleson, Texas.  She also taught Betty Buckely too.  I didn't really like her very much.  I mean Mrs. Marsh.  I have nothing against Betty Buckley.  I have strayed again from the subject.  Okay.  So over the fast ten years I have had a very strong impression that I needed to write down the things that I have learned about life and what has worked for me in a very simple format that people can understand.  I believe that there are certain universal or spiritual principles that work just as consistently as the law of gravity or physics.  I have started the book many times, but then I begin to question who I think I am to write this book.  I wonder what I will say.  I wonder if what I will write will be good enough.  I wonder if people will get angry and send me exploding fruitcakes.  I have been able to avoid it for the most part for the past ten years by keeping busy with day-to-day things.  However, since January I have felt like God has been giving me a gentle nudge to take action again.  It's like he keeps putting the thought in my mind now.  I receive an e-mail for the top ten ways to get started on your self-help book via e-mail.  A friend of mine begins have some troubles and I begin writing the book in e-mails and sending it to her and I realize that I'm writing the book so I stop.  It's like every cell in my body is vibrating and telling me, "Just write the damn book!"  So, I wrote a contract with God that I would produce one chapter a week.  I am commiting to that. Anthing more that I do in a week is just icing on the cake.  I'm avoiding it any way I can, but now that I have gotten that off my chest, I'll go ahead and start.  Today's chapter is about forgiveness.  I guess I'd better start now or I'll never forgive myself.

       SOUTHLAND IN THE SPRINGTIME   I got up early to follow up on the settlement statement for today's closing.  For morning closings, I like to have the HUD the day before so I can review the figures and make sure there are no mistakes for my client.  It also lets me know how much money they need to bring to the closing.  I had that resolved a little before 10:00am.  I took a quick shower.  I bought a house journal to give them and wrapped it in a nice wrappign paper that matches my business card.  Make fun of me if you like, but this type of thing has worked in getting me so much business.  I left the top down last night.  It was warm when I left for my closing this morning so I left the top down.  I got on the highway and I realized that my hair was noc completely dry.  I had pulled out the All Hits album by All Saints to listen to on my drive today.  Remember them?  The edgey Spice Girls.  I love Pure Shores, which was from that movie The Beach.  William Orbit, of Ray Of Light fame, wrote and produced it.  Great song for having the top down.  When I parked in the garage and looked in the rear view mirror, I saw Elsa Lancaster as The Bride Of Frankenstein.  It wasn't pretty.  I looked like I was auditioning for a B-52's musical review.  With some force and a little spit, I was able to tame it down a bit, but I was still sporting some maximum volume.  I looked like a pineable... a S-E-X-X-Y pineapple.  The closing went well.  I love closing with George and Mark.  George is so much fun to work with and Mark does a great job with the closing.  The client was a little nervous.  He's only borrowing about quarter of a million.  It's understanable.  We kept the conversation going with he and his girlfriend to take some of the edge off.  They are such a great couple.  I forgot their gift because the VP called just before I was walking out the door.  I got involved with our conversatoin and just went off and left it on the dining room table.  I have to admit, I did a damn fine job with that colored raffia ribbon.  Who knows what I'll do next?    After the closing, I tooled up to Buck head to run two errands before coming back Jef Base Alpha.  I was at a stoplight with my sporty shaes on.  The sun was giving my skin a hot wet kiss and the wind blew through the Bradford pear trees overhead.  A swarmd of delicate, white tree blossoms descended upon my head and into the cockpit of my car.  It made me think of the song Southland In The Springtime by the Indigo Girls.  I've always liked that song.  One verse is about Texas, my first home, and the second verse is about Georgia, my second.  It made me think of Joan, Susan and I slurring our way through the song at 800 Benge Street right after I had graduated from college.  Good times.  It is such a beautiful day.

       GAY PILL   I wrote a story a few years ago about a lesbian couple and a gay couple who are friends.  One day, one of the lesbians states that the pharmaceutical company that she works for has come up with a pill that can chemically rewire you into being straight.  Because she is a valued employee, she can have four of these pills in  a test trial.  She asks the others if they would like a pill.  The older of the male couple wants children and agrees to take one of the pills.  "What happens to me?" Asks the other guy.  The elder of the lesbians takes one of the pills too.  She doesn't want to be discriminated against anymore.  A few months later, the older lesbian visits the younger lesbian.  She wants to make amends.  Changing her sexual orientation did not keep her from being discrimanted against.  They found other things about her to set her apart.  The younger lesbian kiss her goodbye and sends her on her way  The older man seeks out the younger man.  He is married to a woman now and his wife is pregnant.  He can't get the younger guy out of his mind.  He is very sexually attracted to his wife, but he still thinks like a gay man.  The younger guy explains that a pill may allow you to have sex with a woman now, but being gay, your personalitym they are all learned and developed.  A pill is not going to resolve that.  It can take your identity away.  The older man cries and crumbles as the younger man walks away.

       USING MY WONDER GAY POWERS   I get so tired of hearing people talking about gay people making other people, especially children, gay. What are we supposed to do?  Slime them?!  If we can make someone gay, couldn't we make them ungay?  Wouldn't we make ourselves ungay?  It would be a heck of a lot easier to be a straight, white male.  If I could make anyone gay, I would make George W. Bush gay.   "Wonder Gay powers... activate!"   I would make him gay, nellie and a B.O.B. (Big Ol' Bottom).  I want his experiene to be as far as removed from his world now so that he can gain some perspective.  Let him see how the decisions he is making in his office are affecting the people who may have very little in common with him.  Heck, while we're at it, let's make him a woman. How about a little color?  African-American?  Asian?  Hispanic?  Pacific Islander?  Better yet, let's make him transgendered and desiring to have his penis split down the middle and forced up inside his body to form an artifical vagina.  Now let's ask him what sort of rights he should have?  Then I would send a bevy of adolescent Bible-thumpin' boys with his chains into his room to show him what they do to his kind in these parts.  No, I wouldn't.  Treating him like that doesn't make it right.  It brings me down to his level and that's not what Jesus would do.  Maybe it's because I'm growing older, but I seem unable to tolerate discrimation of any kind with every year.

       BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO   My friend, T., called from Dallas today.  She just received another promotion three weeks ago, which means she has reached level seven in less than five years.  Most of her other co-workers have taken ten years or more to reach that level.  It's had her thinking.  Her partner moved out of state for a promotion last fall and they have had a long distance relationship ever since.  They were experiencing some troubles last summer and almost broke up, but decided to get back together.  T. hasn't had much luck finding a job in the other state.  Her partner is working 16-hour days seven days a week.  Some of the issues from last summer are resurfacing again.  If T. quits her job to move out of state, will she even be able to see her parnter if she works all the time.  What if things don't work out between them.  She's grown use to living alone now.  She doesn't want to depend upon her partner to take care of her financially.  If T. moves out of state and it doesn't work out, she's lost everything she's worked for: promotion and the relationship.     T: What should I do?  Jef: What do you want to do?  T. I'm feeling like I may want to just let go.  Jef: Is that what you feel on a gut-level.  Silence  Jef: Well?  T: I think so.  Jef: It's been nine years.  Are you sure that you don't want some time to think about it?  T: I want to give it some time, but I'm pretty sure I know what I want.  It's like I have been grieving what used to be for the past few months.  Jef: Have y'all thought about counseling?  T: She won't go.  She doesn't want to deal with what she's running from.  Jef: Maybe that's why she works so much.  T: Yeah, you're probably right.  Jef: You know, I love you both and want what's best for the both of you.  T: I know.  We've been through this before so many times, haven't we?  Jef: It's just like taking out the Christmas tree each year.  It's nothing that a swirl at JR's can't fix.  T: Only if the DJ will play the Celine Dion video for Misled.  Jef: Whatever you want.  T: I still care about her.  Jef: I know.  T: I always will.  Jef: I know.    T: Why do I feel so bad?  Jef: You can't make someone deal with their stuff if they don't want to.  It's like the sneeze guard at Souper Salad.  You see the pasta salad in front of you, but you can't touch it because their is this invisible sneeze guard between you and the pasta salad.  You know what I mean?  The pasta salad has to let the sneeze guard down.  She won't let her sneeze guard down.  You can't blame yourself for that.  Don't blame her, just accept where she's at.  T: Your analogies scare me.  What scares me more is that I understand them.    Silence  T: I love you.  Jef: I love you too.

       BUSH ALLOWS GAYS TO BE FIRED FOR BEING GAY     From the  urlLink Mis-Leader   Despite President Bush's pledge that homosexuals "ought to have the same rights" (1) as all other people, his Administration this week ruled that homosexuals can now be fired from the federal workforce because of their sexual orientation.  According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now "have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay." (2) While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3) Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, "During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation." (4)    Sources:   1.     Debates, 10/11/2000.  2.     "OSC to study whether bias law covers gays", Federal Times, 03/15/2004 3.

       ONE OF MY FAVORITE INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES   I was shuffling through some papers in my filing cabinet when I came across a piece of paper that had one of my favorite quotes written on it. It's both inspiring and funny.   Try everything except incest and folk dancing.    -Sir Thomas Beacham

       IS IT KOSHER TO DISCUSS OUR FOIBLES?   2F's read part of my blog the other day when I had left it up on my computer and went to fix dinner.  "You paint me out to be some sort of horrible ogre!"  He exclaimed.  "No," I replied.  "I just wrote that you had a very rough day and you were a bit grouchy toward me when you came home.  I have my days too."  This offered no relief and the discussion moved on to new topics.  However, it has stayed with me for the last few weeks.  Last night at dinner, my friends were discussing my blog.  "I waste so much time going back to your blog to see if you have written anything new yet," said Paul, who is one of the biggest supporters of my creative efforts.  "I'm sure they advertise a 12-Step Program in Creative Loafing for that."  I replied.  "Don't mock me, princess." He said with his left eyebrown arched menancingly.  "Does 2F's read your blog?  Does he know what you write about him?"  "No, not usually.  He read part of a post the other day and was none too pleased.  Why do you ask that?"  So a discussion insued.  What was the result?  I posted some details of a wonderful man's foibles in a fair manner, but in a bold or foolish way depending upon whom you talk to.  What is the point of having freedom of expression if you can't use it?  So, after meditating upon this for awhile, I figure that in the interest of equal time for both political parties, I would write an ode to everything wonderful about 2F's.    The first thing you notice about him is that he really listens to you and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world.  He is very kind toward all people and is the perfect host when anyone comes to visit.  He will turn around and go back to help someone change a tire on the highway.  He has been known to leaven envelopes of money in the mailboxes of friends who are having a moment of financial unrest.  He is very funny and can make me laugh when he's acting silly.  He's very, very intelligent and his analytica prowess can be intimidating at times.  His intrinsic desire is to do the right thing for everybody, even when it may not be the outcome that would be best for him or that he would prefer.  He is very dedicated to his family and friends.  He's very handsome too.  Now I could mention that the first time I met him, he told me that I looked like Timothy McVey, but I don't want to spoil the image or mood that I weaved, so I won't mention that.  I will mention, however, that he is the first person I have met that I ever felt like I would lay down my life for.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is my ode to the wonderful qualities of 2F's.

       WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT...   I am a member of  urlLink Image Film & Video Center .  They held a free screening at the Central Atlanta Fulton County Public Library.  It was entitled  When You Least Expect It... A Queer Shorts Program .  I met some friends downtown last night and we enjoyed the show.  I was a few minutes late because one of my clients called as I was walking out the door.  I hate being late, but my clients come first.  He had just realized that he needed to bring $1,000 more to Friday's closing than he originally thought.  I calmed him down and we explored his options.  I reminded him that his first mortgage payment will not be due until May 1st so I adivsed that he may want to take a $1,000 cash advance from one of his credit cards, bring that t closing and he can pay it back in April.  I presented a solution and that calmed him down.  Clients become so excited in the beginning when they are buying a home.  There is so much going on to distract them when we go over the Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and I advise them what the monthly payment will be and how much money they will need to bring to closing.  We came into the screening room and sat down during the middle of the first one,  Encounter  by Lou Peterson. A young gay man is walking through the park when an older man approaches him and offers him $100 to be intimate with him.  The young man freaks out and goes home.  He thinks about things and then goes out to find the man again.  He finds him in his car and offers to go home with him, but the man can only look; he can't touch.  The man says they must go back to his place because he doesn't know the kid isn't a serial killer.  They go back to the young man's place and the older man takes ten $10 bills out of an envelope and gives them to the young man.  He says that he puts a $10 bill in an envelope each day so that he could be with somone like him.  It's very creepy and ends with the young man taking his shirt off and the older man walking up to him.  It's unclear to me what the director was trying to convey with this one.  If he was going for creepy, he didn't go far enough because it just ended without any sort of resolution.   This Car Up  by Eric Mueller has an unusual format.  In the lower side of the screen we see the action taking place in the lives of Pete, a 30ish white collar worker and a 20ish bicyle messenger.  They are very different from one another.  Pete is clean cut and smokes.  The messenger is tattooed and pierced and using the patch to give up smoking.  In the upper portion of the screen, we see what they are thinking or imagining.  They run into one another downstairs by the bike rack while Pete is smoking and the messenger has just finished delivering a package to Pete's office.  There is an attraction, but before they can do anything about it, the messenger's pager goes off.  Duty calls.  We see them thinking about one another over the weekend and then on Monday, the messenger returns to talk to Pete as he is about to have a package sent to himself.  It was a sweet story.  The format was a little confusing at first until I figured out the footage on the top of the screen was their thoughts.  The acting was good and the actors had good chemistry.  I liked the fact that they came from different worlds.  There are voiceovers from TV programs that were not readily apparent to me how they related to the story.  All in all, I liked it.   Seventy  by Q. Allan Brocka, may have been my favorite.  A straight man goes to visit his gay best friend on his birthday.  They have been friends since they were 15.  Knowing that his friend is in love with him, the straight man decides to give himself to his gay friend on his 70th birthday.  They have sex and then the straight man feels guilty and says he made a mistake.  "You cannot tell Suzanna (his wife!)" he says as opens a door to leave. There is Suzanna along with many other friends in a room decorated for a birthday party.  Holding a cake with a half-melted "70" birthday candle, Suzanna looks somewhat confused by the situation and can only say, "Surprise!"  Boy, that was an understatement.  This story has an interesting twist that I think has always been there for gay men who have close straight friends.  It was short and succinct.  It featured older men in their 60's.  It was very fresh to me.  My only complaint is trying to figure out why the straight man chose to open a door that he should have known led to another room instead of the front door.  Perhaps he was going to finish dressing in there.  Come to think of it, maybe it was his birthday and that's why his wife could not come with him to visit his friend.  The gay character practices asking where she is in the beginning.  Maybe it was the straight man's birthday, but that doesn't make much sense since he was giving himself to the gay man for the gay man's birthday.  Perhaps this one could use some fine tuning.   Las Amigas Bonitas  by Susan Youssef was probably my lease favorite. It opens with two Hispanic girls sitting on the curb in front of a convenience store. As the camera slowly moves across the parking lot toward them, one girl takes an apple out of her purse and bites into it.  She then offers it to her buctcher (when a woman dresses, cuts her hair and mannerisms tend to be more manly than lady like, not someone whos cuts and sells meat for a living) friend.  The butch girl has a flash back to the night before where her mother is beating her little brother, who is under the kitchen table, with a wooden spoon.  The butch girl throws her mother against the wall.  She runs to the convenience store, where I believe she works based upon her shirt.  A fellow employee is there.  She consoles her.  She kisses her.  The butch girl wakes up in a bed and watches the wind blow sheer curtains in the sunlight.  Cut back to the girls sitting on the curb and eating the apple.  I'm still not sure what that was all about.  The photography was nice though.   Mother's Day  by David Quantic was both humerous and dramatic.  Isaac brings his younger brother, Dougie, home to live with both he and his partner, Josh.  Tension arises when Isaac refuses to tell Dougie that he and Josh are lovers.  Dougie has been through some sort of accident, which I assume was a car crash based upon Dougie waking up from his sleep with the sound of a car crash in his head.  He watches videos of his mother talking to him and how the psychiatrist thinks it best that he live with his brother for awhile.  She seems pretty cool toward the living arrangement with Josh.  Things don't go well.  Josh doesn't bathe and or do anything.  He sits and watches videos of he and his old girlfriend and skims through a high school yearbook.  Josh gives Isaac the ultimatum of telling him about their relationship.  Isaac, a handsome man who is not too pretty, cannot reveal the truth so tells Dougie that Josh will help him look for an apartment.    On the way out, Dougie calls Isaac "Dad" and asks if he can go to the high school dance.  Confused, Isaac says they will talk about it later.  Dougie refuses to relate to Josh at breakfast, but makes a reference toward his mother.  Josh has an idea and dresses up like Dougie's mother.  He responds and Josh makes Dougie clean up before they go buy some clothes for the dance.  They go to a store and try on a rather 80's looking ensemble.  Josh is moved by the sheer joy  that Dougie experiences but disturbed at how he is trapped in time.  They return home expecting the girlfriend to call so that her parents can talk to his parents about getting pizza afterwards.  The girl does call, but she is living in the present.  She has met someone new and cannot wait for Dougie anymore.  He collapses.  The last scene has Josh visiting Dougie in the hospital.  Isaac doesn't know how to relate to Dougie.  The film ends with Josh opening the curtain to let in the light in the room.  I enjoyed this one, but it seems to show more information being clarified about the actors.  It would probably make a nice main stream full-length film with Ben Stiller and the blonde Owens brother with the broken nose.  It has humor, but pathos as well.   The Fair And The Weak  by Lauren Cook uses stock footage of girls and women from the '30, '40's and '50's to provide the visuals for a voice over from a lesbian who has been done wrong by many types of women.  It was very appealing and funny.  It was voted most likely to have been written by me by my friend, Paul.   Ritchie's Itch  by Michael Shea was a popular favorite among my group.  A straight man wakes up from a dream where he is running naked in the woods while being chased by another naked man.  They had been talking when suddenly they were naked and he starts running from the other man.  They are about to have sex, when he wakes up... with a semi-erection.  The man is disturbed by the dream and tells a buddy on the construction site about it.  Through a hillarious discourse, his buddy manages to convince Ritchie that the dream is symbolic and nothing to worry about it.  He finally convinces Ritchie he is not gay when he pulls out his penis and asks him, "Are you gettin hard?  Do you wanna snack on this? No?  You're not gay."  The dream reoccurs at the end.  However, this time the person waking up his Ritchie's Buddy.  It was very well acted and written.  It fit in nicely with the program, but I wouldn't necessarily say it was a queer film.  It was very gay friendly.  I didn't find it to be disparaging toward homosexuals at all.  Afterwards, we went to the Landmark Diner.  I was frustrated by the strong potato presence on the menu.    "Just get double vegetables," Tim suggested.  "I don't want half a plate of steamed brocoli," I whined back.  I had a tasty chef salad instead.

       HOW TO TICKLE A PICKLE   Betty Bowers, America's Best Christian, features a "How To" article by Laura Bush,  urlLink A Christian Lady's Guide to the Disgusting Marital Obligation of Biannual Fellatio .  This just isn't right, but the depravity of Betty Bowers always keeps me in line.  Ironically, I rather like Laura Bush.  Anyone who could have murdered her first boyfriend, got away with it and married a future president demands respect.

       MABELINE SAMPLES ENTERS THE RING   My friend, Steve, is entering the ring for drag queen mud wrestling next Monday at the Throckmorton Mining Company in Dallas.  He's been thinking about it since last year when they first started it.  Therefore, Monday, Mabeline Samples enters the ring!I am so bummed that I'm going to miss it.  I actually thought about hopping on a plane and going, but I have a closing so I cannot justify being gone.  If you live in the area, stop by and support him.  Tell him Jef sent you.  I'd like to tell you about Steve and how I met him.  I've been friends with Steve since 1993.  My best friend had not only just tested positive for hiv, but had full-blown aids to boot.  This revealed to his circle of friends that there was a side of Kent, that we did not not know about.  There was a side that was willing to forgo a condom if he thought the person would leave.  I remember being dumbfounded and trying to figure out how my bestfriend since I was 13 and spent most of my free time with could feel so alone.  I was temping in a job that was showing no signs of hiring me.  I quit working for a week and just stayed in bed for a few days.  I discovered that even if you roll over on your stomach and put your pillow over your head, you don't stop thinking.  You don't quit realizing that your world and your relationship with your best friend is about to change.  You are scared for him and his health.  You are scared that you may not be good enough of a person to be there for him.  You wonder how you can have a college degree and still barely make enough to survive on.  You wonder how is it fair that you can be in perfect health and your best friend is sick and there is no cure.  I wondered how I could still live with someone that I knew could not be a boyfriend or a friend anymore even though we struggled with a relationship that blurred the lines.  It was the one area that I probably knew what to do, but the state of the other areas of my life made that decision impossible.  I went to the Gay & Lesbian Young Adults meeting.  It was always sort of a hit or miss thing for me.  At that point there were more people in high school than in the early 20's like me.  I was always amazed at the number of straight-acting boys I would see come to the meeting, meet some new friends and then - FLAME ON - they were a drag queen in street clothes.  In time, they would swing back to find a healthy balance between the two.  They just wanted to feel like they belonged to some group and fit in.  There were some friends I made, but never close ones.  Afterwards we go to Hunky's to eat.  Most of the group couldn't go to bars.    Somehow, I ran into Kent's boyfriend at the time.  Evidently they had used condoms because Dan's test came back negative.  Kent hinted at one person that he thought it may have been who infected him, but I'm not even sure if he really knows.  I never met the guy.  He was a name as well as a statistic.  I'm not even sure if it was important to Kent to know who it was.  Dan sees that I'm still very down about what has happened.  He began to tell me a story that I thought was going to be very stupid, but it turned out to be one of the most useful things I have learned in my life.  During the decline of Fergie's marriage with Prince Andrew she was feeling very depressed.  She gained a bunch of weight.  She was the object of princess backlash while Princess Diana was adored.  She turned to her grandmother for advice.  Her grandmother told her that she should go volunteer and help people.   When you do that, you are focusing on helping other people with their problems and you are not focused on your own.  It makes you feel better.  Fergie took it to heart and it worked.  It helped her get through one of the darkest periods in her life.  I sat and looked at Dan for a moment.  Inside, I felt my inner ding go off and I knew that this was something that I needed to do.  I called the aids resource center and volunteered as a condom guerilla. We met on Tuesday nights and stuffed safe sex kits.  Afterwards, we usually made condom runs to some of the local bars.  It was here that I met Steve.  How do I describe him?  He's like the smell of Tollhouse cookies baking.  You are always happy to see him and he makes you feel very comfortable.  I instantly liked him. We met at his apartment and Steve prepared screw drivers for all of us before we made our condom run.  Steve did some contract work for Seagrams and had lots of alchohol.  The screwdrives came in those large 48 ounce plastic cups.  I couldn't understand why the screwdriver effected me so much, but I later learned that for the orange flavor and color, Steve would stir the vodka with an orange popsicle.  I was basically drinking 48 ounces of vodka.    As we walked through the Crews Inn, I handed out safe sex kits.  People were appreciative.  People asked questions.  I answered them and was surprised at the lack of knowledge among so many people.  I actually felt better.  I wasn't focused on Kent and my own situation. This was my first step of coming out of my funk.  Somehow Steve and I ended up talking on the phone.  We laughed, but we had some deep discussions too.  He knew that I was out of work and offered to hire me to do some work for him.  This was my second step to coming out of the funk.  I would show up each day.  We talked a bit as I worked and I realized that I had choices.  I could choose how I looked at Kent and his situation.  I could see him dying or I could see him living.  We talked.  He said that he may might have to be by himself sometimes, but he knew that I was there.  I had choices regarding my work situation and I soon found another job.  Steve and I began to hang out a bit.  Sometimes we wander around JR's and the Village Station and just have fun.  I began to realize that Chris and I no longer needed to live together and was slowly becoming comfortable with that idea.  I cared about him and knew he cared about me, but not in the right way.  We hurt each other more than we helped each other.  He had successfully come out and adjusted to his sexuality now.  He even made some friends of his own.  It was time for me to let go and give him a push out of the nest and move on with my life.  It's hard to put into words what Steve did for me.  He was someone who just offered to be there with me as I struggled to walk again.  Some people may not think it was much, but when the idea of getting out of bed is overwhelming, help like that is a huge blessing.  We are still close, but we don't have as much frequent contact.  With time, you don't have to.  You pick up right where you left off.  You talk about what is really important.  It's like having $25 in birthday money to buy anything you want.  You choose carefully.  Ten years ago I could not see the beauty in that.  Now I can.

       MEMORIES OF MY MY LITTLE SISTER'S FIRST SEIZURE   Every morning I get up early and have some morning time.  I write three pages of stream-of-conscious writing called  Morning Pages , which Julia Cameron discusses in her book  The Artist Way .  Sometimes what comes to me is la la la stuff.  Sometimes it helps me vent.  Sometimes it's just a big brain flush.  Other days it helps me organize my ideas, goals, etc.  Some days I even have thoughts come up that surprise me and lead me into a new and exciting direction.  Today, I had a memory from 1986.  We had gone to Gun Barrel City for a family reunion on my father's side.  I remember that I we listened to Belinda Carlisle's Belinda albumand Madonna's True Blue on the way there.  It was hot.  We ate a lot.  I saw relatives that I had never met before and that are now in prison from what I hear. (I should write to them.)  My little sister played with several of the other kids and wore herself out.  When we arrived home, she lay on the couch resting from the vigorous activity of the day.  Suddenly her eyes rolled back in her head and she started convulsing.  My mother picked her up and ran to the bathtub.  She poured cold water over her my little sister while my father found the rubbing alcohol.  They begin to give my little sister a sponge bath with the rubbing alcohol.  I believe this brings down the body temperature so that the swelling of the brain, which is causing the seizure, will go down.  Finally, the seizure stopped, but my little sister wasn't responding.  We rushed to the car.  My mother, carrying my sister, was in the back.  My father rode shotgun while I drove.  My mother told me to do 100mph, so I did. Eventually a Texas Highway Patrolman put on his lights and signaled for me to pull over.  My mother, caught up in the excitement of the situation, flailed her left arm like a broken wing and urged me to keep driving.  She was afraid that if we stopped, it might cause brain damage.  My father insisted that we stop and my mother hopped out of the car and ran back to the patrol car shouting and waiving her arms in the air.  I just knew she would be shot.  Now days, she probably would have been. She quickly explained the situation to the officer and soon he was leading the way for us to the hospital.    Once at the hospital, we took my sister to the emergency room where she quickly responded.  The doctor told us we did the right thing and there was no sign of any brain damage from the seizure.  Although when my little sister behaves in any way that is not congruent with my mother's expactations, she will mention that the seizure is probably the key to my sister's undoing.  This brings another thought to mind.  Why do the British say they are going to hospital and Americans say that they are going to the hospital?

       MY CREATIVE ENDEAVORS ARE MY CHILDREN   Yesterday was a long day.  I finished with my new client's file about 6:30 and went to the gym.  I worked out and came back and made dinner.  We ate and then I cleaned up the kitchen and decided to go upstairs and watch  Absolutely Fabulous, Series  5.  I had seen the first two episodes on TV, but had missed the others.  It's difficult for my to commit to television because I lead a very active life.  When I'm home, I just don't think about watching TV.  In fact, I have no idea when any particular show comes on.    I'm watching Patsy & Edina and I notice that they have changed the opening music and credits.  This season seems to be funnier.  I notice that some of the characters are beginning to look older.  How long has this show been on?  Good grief!  The first series was shown on the BBC in 1992 and it debuted on Comedy Central in 1994.  That's twelve years!    I was really inspired by this series when it came out.  I was in a play at the time and had one of the lead roles and several members of the cast began hanging out together.  It was summer and we'd sit by the pool and drink and talk about writing our own series and filming it with local cable access.  I still have several of the scripts. However, by autumn, our little group had drifted apart as quickly as it had come together. I became involved in another one of my dysfunctioal relationships that my friends referred to as another one of my "growing experiences."  Nothing happened with any of the scripts that I wrote between 1994-1996.  I found them recently when I was looking for something in the catacombs of the My Documents folder.  For the most part, they are very good, but need a bit of spit and polish.  By summer, maybe I will have finished my outstanding unfinished projects and can find some local film-makers at Image that might like to do something with them.  I could also share them with the writers group.  I sat awhile after I turned off the TV.  I thought how much I admired Jennifer Saunders for writing and starring in this series.  I thought about twelve years and all the time that I've let slip by without doing anything with my creativity during those ten years since I first saw  Absolutely Fabulous .  If my children were born in 1994, they would be ten years old.  It occured to me that in a sense, my creative endeavors are my children.  When I let them shine, they make me proud like children.  I can surround myself with my artwork and see it every day.It may sound that I am sad, but I'm not.  Instead of using this as something to beat myself down with, I actually find it more motivating to actually get in the ball and do more now.  I can't go back so why cry over it.?  Besides, I needed the time to work through those growing experiences and become the person that I am today.  Not everyone is supposed to be successful with their creative efforts an early age.  For some reason, Dabney Coleman and Whoopi Goldberg come to mine.   So far this year, I've been off to a good start. The most exciting thing is that I don't know where the next turn will take me or what I will find.  I love adventure!

       TESTOSTERONE & SO MUCH MORE   I have to write a story in 2,000 words or less about testosterone for my writers group.  I decided to goolgle the "T" word and do some research for a not-so-obvious angle on this male hormone.  Do you know how many Web sites are out there for testosterone?!  14 billion!  Most of them are focused on muscle building or women going through menopause.  What is this testosterone gel?    "Honey, you've cut off your finger with the chainsaw.  Why don't you put some testostrone gel on the stump and your finger will grow back in a matter of minutes."  Ouch!  I knew a girl once who said that she refused to write about people losing their limbs because she felt as if she was attracting that kind of thing to happen to her.  She would generally cross her arms and legs at that tme as if she might lose them by joy driving her desk around the classroom and losing her arm on a mailbox.  People get hung up over extremities.  Animals aren't that way at all.  They go with the flow.    "Oh, my legs are gone.  When did that happen?  Hey, a squirrel.  ARF! ARF! ARF!"  For example, Buddy, my cat, was accidently hit by a car cutting through the drive way of the old house.  It was one of the worst breaks the vet had ever seen.  Some of her femur was powderized.  The choice was either to take the leg off or put her to sleep.  It was worse on us that it was on her.  It's a hind leg so she hops around the house and she can pull herself up on the couch with front claws.  With the exception of falling down in the litter box as she was kicking kitty litter onto her business, she doesn't generally have much of a problem.  In fact, it's one less thing she has throw behind her head to lick her anus.  Of course, every once in a while I catch her cocking her ear to the side and the nub moves as if she is scratching herself, but she is basically shooting blanks.  Animals aren't concerned with image.  When is the last time you heard a dog or cat walk into a room and ask their owner, "Do you think I'm fat?"  No, I rest my case.

       THE TOP 10 DO'S & DON'TS OF PITCHING OPRAH   Most people believe that getting on Oprah will make them richer than Joe Millionaire. For your career to careen toward the stars, you must prepare to make the most of your appearance. Here are 10 do's and don'ts to help you reach the dream of being on Oprah. As a media coach and marketing expert, I have helped many people be great guests on Oprah. Follow this advice to increase your chances of getting on the show.  1. When you call producers, don't launch into a long rambling story about why you should be on Oprah.  2. Don't send huge amount of information, or your entire life story with photos from childhood, to producers.  They have to sort through thousands of packages just like yours. Just send what's necessary.  3. Don't keep re-sending the same information over and over again if you have not gotten a response.  You need to try a different angle or a twist with each new pitch.  4. Don't pitch yourself, your product, service or your book, instead pitch a newsworthy angle that appeals to her audience.  5. Don't leave a telephone pitch longer than 15 seconds via voicemail.  Be sure to leave your phone number at the beginning and at the end of the call. Producers hate to wait until the end of the message to get your phone number. And if your message is too long they fast forward or just delete it.  6. Do send a very brief pitch letter outlining your concept or angle in one or two (short) paragraphs.  7. Do create an entire show with a theme and envision how each of the segments will unfold.  List all of the guests on that segment who tie into your theme. Make sure you, of course, are the star of the segment.  8. Do make sure you are not replaceable.  You must position yourself so that no one else can contribute the particular information and insights that you have.  9. Do have the a media room on your website that includes a two-minute video of your prior TV show appearances, a list of topics you are prepared to discuss, and your bio.  10. Do try to target the appropriate producer for your segment.  You can call the receptionist and ask to be connected to the person who handles your beat (health, spirituality, books). If you are connected to a producer and they are not the right person for your area of expertise or for the topic of your segment, please use the opportunity to find out exactly whom you should be contacting and get their direct line. Good luck!

       WHAT IS TRUTH?    urlLink CCN.com  ran a story today regarind the publication of a new book by Richard Clarke, the former counter-terrorism coordinator for the Bush Administration.  Clarke claimed President Bush has done a terrible job battling terrorism in an interview on 60 Minutes last night.  Likewise, officials for the Bush Administration say that Clarke was a disgruntled employee who passed over for a position in the Department of Homeland Security.  It is implied that President Bush went into the White House in January of 2001 looking for some link to Iraq and was hoping to find one after the events of September 11th.  What is the truth?  It's hard to say.  One could say that Clarke and Bush both know, but perhaps not.  If Bush and Clarke were standing on opposite street corners and saw the same automobile accident, would they report the same thing?  How does our upbringing, education and circle of friends influence what we see and how we interpret it?   I'm concerned by the lack of interest that some Americans have in verifying information they receive from friends, family, TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, the Internet, etc.  If I don't particularly follow either Kerry or Bush in the media, if a co-worker tells me that one is a good candidate and one is not, I'll probably buy into their opinion because I have no other information to compare it to.  It's subjective and not necessarily accurate.  If a candidate voted for or opposed a bill in Congress, you can run a spin on it both ways.  If Congressman Smith votes for a bill to prosecute against sexual assault offenders, most people would interpret that as a good thing.  He's playing tough ball with rapists and protecting women.  On the other hand, if we find out more about this bill and it states that an alleged rapist can be tried and sentenced without requiring any physical proof, such as DNA, to prove his guilt, this would change our opinion about Congressman Smith's decision.  We have to do our research before we buy into our opinion. If you don't like Kerry, but don't know any particular facts to discredit him as a potential President, just say, "You know, I just don't like Kerry for some reason."  I would have more respect for this than someone who makes up stuff about Kerry to show him in a poor light.  The same goes for Bush.    I was discussing the Martha Stewart trial with friends at both lunch and dinner.  I personally feel that she did not receive a fair trial.  There is no way she can.  She is too well known.  Everyone knows has heard that she treats employees badly and had an affair with her daughter's fiancee, but she also can turn work cornhusk into something beautiful like nobody's business.  Martha did something wrong.  Yes, and she deserves to pay the consequences for it.  However, should she receive a felony for lying and 20 years in prison?  Prisons are croweded enough.  Fine her and get a big payoff to pay for all the other prisoners.    Our words and thoughts are very powerful things.  If I accuse John Doe of molesting a child, regardless of whether he is guilty or innocent, Mr. Doe is going to experience some negative effects of that accusation and it could ruin his reputation or business.  Does it have to be true?  No, but the power is still there.  We must use our words and thoughts responsibly.    Now let's take that home a bit.  If a child makes a mistake and I tell him that he is stupid for making that mistake, he may grow up to believe that he is stupid.  If I tell that a child that he tried his best and if he keeps trying, he'll get it right, there is a good chance that child will continue to demonstrate success in what he does again and again and again.  However, how many times do we abuse that inner child in ourselves and keep ourselves stuck when we could be supporting ourselves to soar.  Over the past few weeks I have had many opportunities to say, "I can't do this. I don't know how.  This is new and I'm scared," but I just broke it down in steps and took it one step at time.  I told myself that I could do those things and demonstrated that success.  Hence, I have another couple of loans closing next month.  We are bombarded with messages each day from loved ones, radio, TV, etc.  We have the choice to buy into and believe what we hear or we can analyze and choose to reinforce the thoughts and words that are going to help us build success instead of helping us to destroy our self-esteem and accomplishment.    For today, I challenge you to listen to your self-talk. How many negative things do you say about yourself or others each day?  How much information do you take in each day without discretion as far as the source and the veracity of those statements?  If you find a lot of negativity there, put a spin on it.  Something that may have sucked before or been from hell can now be challenging to your peace of mind or an opportunity for growth.  You can always start over again in each new moment.  And to quote Mel & Kim, "It only takes a moment to feel alright."

       JEFFFIFER MEETS BRIANIFER   Tonight Jeff and I went to dinner with Brian and Brian.  It was very interesting to break bread with two people with the same name.  Now I know what it's like when Jeff and I go to dinner with other people.  We went to Loco Luna, a tapas bar.  FYI, be sure to enunciate when telling your mother what you did this past weekend.  Otherwise she'll want to know why you went to a topless bar.  Brian bought a new mobile phone today.  It's very tiny.  In fact, I would say it's trial size.  I ordered a strawberry margarita because I had been without one for so long.  We ordered several different things.  I enjoyed the salmon over the sweet potato mash with orange puree.  The chicken skewers were good too.  I had seared tuna as well.    The conversation was good.  Everything they seemed to say was interesting and we laughed a lot too.  My only criticism is that the restaurant was too loud.  Afterwards, we walked over to Jake's for ice cream.  I had a dip of strawberry cheesecake and chocolate laya cake.  I don't know what anyone else had because it was one of those rare all-about-me moments.  Brian and Briand told Roxie stories and we told Buddy stories.  We laughed some more.    Next, we are planning to go to Six Flags Over Georgia.  I also realized that I really want to go to the Blondie concert.  I love their new song Good Boys.    Okay.  I must go to bed now.  I'm falling asleep.  I just had to share.

       WORD FOR TODAY   Salad Days, noun: a time of youthful inexperience, innocence, or indescretion.    Example:  Thelma remembered her salad days of time spent at Taco Bell on Friday nights and cruising the strip.  Now her fine dining consisted of Jenny Craig and cruising consisted of chasing a diaperless two-year-old through the house.

       JEF UNDER GLASS  Looking back over the past few months I have kept this blog, I have noticed that my posts have increased in length and have become somewhat more introspective.  I no longer focus on writing what I think other people want to read, but what words, thoughts and ideas come to me when I cast the net of my mind out into the cosmos.  Was today a good catch?  Today was what I felt.  Today was what I thought.  Today is what is.  I never kept a jounral except back in 1995 for a few months.  I dawned on me this evening that if something were to happen to me, this is would be all that is left to document who I was, what I thought and how I felt.  Is it an accurate reflection?  I don't know. If after I have returned to the dust from which I came, could someone accurately reconstruct my personality and essence based upon the words I commited to ASCII and uploaded to a server?  Could they piece together my psyche and understand what was important to me.  Would they know for sure what I felt my purpose was to come into this world and whether or not I felt that I was successful in achieving it?  I don't know.  Perhaps, time will tell.  Perhaps my children or my family will cherish these posts one day as it may be the only link to someone who was once flesh and blood to them, but now is fading fast with every  waking moment of consciousness.

       REMEMBERING TRACY   When I was in high school, I had a friend named Tracy.  She was a reminder that there were two sorts of people outside the norm.  One was a free spirit who lived their life freely out of curiosity and a celebration of life.  The other was a rebel who lived their life fueled by hopelessness and anger.    Tracy said what she wanted to say whenever she felt like saying it to whom she felt like saying it.  She once told me that she caught a live rat and took it to I-35, dowsed it with gasoline and then lit it with a match.  She said, "Boy, you should have seen it fly up the highway.  It passed two semis."  I laughed at the time partly out of picturing this scene with a cartoon rat or puppet like they used in the movie  Caddy Shack .  I also laughed because there was a gaping void between Tracy and I that felt uncomfortable not to be filled with something.  I realize now that I am older that this was simply and early sign of a potential serial killer.  Thinking of a human being torturing an animal in such a way as that makes my stomach turn.  Granted rats are considered vermin and carrier of disease, but nothing deserves to die that way.  I no longer picture an animated rodent, but a living thing suffering.  Tracy once unbent a paper clip and put it in my hand.  "Do you know that that is?" She asked.  "No.  What is it?"  "It's the bionic pubic hair."  For some reason I threw it down in disgust.  Tracy could make you believe anything, even if it was only momentary.  Tracy once went to Wal-mart to visit a friend.  He wasn't there at the time.  She saw a sales clerk's smock laying in a shopping cart.  Tracy decided to put it on and walk around helping customers for a few hours.  She said it felt good.  She said she felt like someone else when she had that smock on.  In fact, she felt like a Rebecca.  "Why Rebecca?" I asked.  "Well, that's what the name tag on the smock said."  Looking back, I wonder if this experience was more profound than a teenage prank.  Maybe it was a physical, mental and emotional escape from her body and her problems.  I wonder.  Tracy once talked back to a teacher who said that she could just march herself down to the Principal's office.  On her way out the door, the teacher asked her how she felt now.  Tracy replied, "Well I'm just so excited I can hardly keep my legs together."  This was a typical Tracy response.  Shortly after that, Tracy didn't come to school for a while.  She would sometimes call me from the Fort Worth Psychiatric Facility.  I would tell her about swimming, the newest song on the radio and what movies I had seen.  She would talk about jell-o, group therapy and how she convinced her therapist that her body was covered by crickets at all times.  There was a passive anger underscoring all of her words.  It was a rage that was just too tired to get up and do much of anything.  After that time, Tracy began to drift out of my life.  When she returned to school, she was quieter and never had much to say.  Conversatons were stilted.  She began spending more time alone.  She may have even dropped out of band.  It's hard to remember now.  About ten years ago, I ran into her at JR's in Dallas.  She didn't smile much, but she seemed better than the last time I had seen her.  Tracy seemed to have grown into her melancholy like getting used to a wool suit that is too big or tight in places by picking at a scab on your thumb to distract you from the uncomfortable feeling surrounding you on all sides.  I believe she gave me her telephone number and I called her once.  I think she told me that an old girlfriend of mine from high school had told her to tell me hello.  It was someone that I had hurt without meaning to. The pain had made my senior year of high school very difficult for me and those who knew us both.  Perhaps that was the only reason for Tracy's path crossing mine.  Perhaps she was just supposed to give me that message and then move on.  The fact that you have nothing in common with an old friend is even more apparent over the phone because there is nothing else to focus on except for their voice and the silence in between when anyone speaks at all.  After we hung up, I threw her phone number away.  I knew in my heart that there was no reason to call back.  I'm not sure where this came from tonight.  I'm not sure why I felt you would even be interested.  I just know that I wonder where Tracy is now and how she's doing. I hope she's well.  I also hope that she has left the rats in peace.

       THE FEROCIOUSNESS OF JOY   Today I received another lead I believe I can actually take all the way to closing.  Joan went with me this afternoon to put my business cards out in various places around the city that have bulletin boards.  It's a numbers game, but I feel strangely compelled to fish for business this way.  It's a gut feeling.  I can't explain it, but I am going to trust it.  Brian and Brian called and wanted to know if Jeff and I wanted to do something tomorrow evening. (Amusing, isn't it?)  We had called Troy and Todd earlier in the week about doing something on Saturday.  I told Brian I would check and get back with him.  We tried calling Troy, but there was no answer at home.  Evidently a girl named Drew now has his cell phone and she sounds tough.  This evening, Jeff, Joan and myself went over to East Atlanta to have dinner.  We went to Heaping Bowl and the food and the service has suffered.  Afterwards we went to Joe's for coffee and dessert.  Oddly enough, we ran into Troy and Todd at Joe's.  .We sat down and visited.  They are moving from the other side of the neighborhood over to our side of the neighborhood, which means we will probably never see them because they are just around the corner.  On the way to Joe's we passed a flyer for film with the title  The Ferociousness Of Joy .  I liked the sound of it and decided to write about it on my blog  Joan and I discussed how we seemed to be in communication with a lot of blogsters who presently live in Dallas or lived there at one time.    I told Joan that she should write a book and dedicate it to her mother.  I have been trying to get her to write for ages.  She writes very well.  Joan started writing a story and then pass it to me.  I continued her thread where she left off and then passed it to Todd.  He wrote a bit and passed it to Troy.  He write a bit and passed it to Jeff.  You see the pattern, don't you?  We amused ourselves with this as we discussed favorite songs from the 1980-1989.  We waxed on abot wearing all black to be cool, the Stark Club and Joan and I sang a duet of Nemesis by Shriekback.   "Priests and canibals Prehistoric animals Everybody happy as the dead come home  Big black nemesis Parthenogenesis No one move a muscle as the dead come home"   I am impressed when a band can write a clever little ditty and use the word parthenogenesis.   Finally, it was time to call it a night and went our separate ways.  Joan will post our group story on  urlLink Conversations With A Woman .

       THE ICEBERGS IN THE DALLAS MUSEUM OF ART   Adam from  urlLink The C-Blog  e-mailed me from Dallas and it brought back an experience that I would like to share with y'all.  When I was in the eighth grade, my art class took a field trip to the Dallas Museum of Art [DOM].  I was a bit self-conscious because at the tender age of 14 I had no formal art background.  Instead I had gained a certain bit of notoriety and respect from the fellow boys in my class for my ability to draw comic book females with breasts so big they almost had their own gravitational field.  I blame this on Lynda Carter and TV's  Wonder Woman  series.  I had dropped out of band because I got braces shortly after I took up the trumpet and there just wasn't enough upper lip to cover all the metal and wax on my upper teeth and cram it all in the mouthpiece.  I felt as if I was moving from one situation for which I had no control or training into another.  After all, my duck carving after four weeks still looked somewhat boxy.  My friend, Susie, had carved a duck decoy that looked as if it could take flight at any time.  She made me nervous because I thought she might like me in "that way."  I shouldn't have worried.  She had short hair and dresses had the same effect on her as garlic does to vampires.  The fact that she carved a navel on her duck disturbed me on a primordial level.  When you first enter into the DOM you find a lot of pottery and female fertility goddesses from indigenous people from Central America.  Then it tapers off into your typical paintings from the middle ages, etc.  I realized that I was seeing work by some of the finest artists of our time.  Although I was missing a day of school, I did not expect to find anything that moved me.  I was fascinated with  Star Wars  at the time and the Go-Go's.  Nothing more actually captured my attention.  Imagine my surprise when I turned the corner and saw one of the most amazing sights I had ever seen.  The painting covered almost an entire wall.  There were track lights shining down on the piece that brought a myriad of colors in the oils.  The name of the paining is " urlLink The Icebergs"  by Frederic Edwin Church and it was painted in 1861.  Here is the description from the DOM Web site:   "In the summer of 1859, Frederic Church embarked on a monthlong sketching trip aboard a chartered schooner exploring the waters off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. Buffeted by high seas and afflicted with seasickness, Church sketched icebergs as they appeared on the horizon until the moment they threatened to capsize the small boats used to draw near them. These sketches inspired Church as he embarked on what was his largest canvas to date. Church's interest in the Arctic stemmed from the disappearance of the Franklin expedition, which was lost while searching for the Northwest Passage in 1847. The ensuing search for Franklin and his crew stimulated American interest in the frozen North as an irresistibly beautiful yet deadly frontier. The ambitious composition and grand scale of The Icebergs are a worthy legacy of the 18th-century tradition of the sublime landscape."   I was absolutely awestruck.  I was completely transported from my classmates into the frozen setting in front of me.  I was inspired by the beauty of the icebergs shimmering in the water, yet afraid of what lurked beneath the waters.  It's the closest that I have ever had to feeling that I had lived before in another life.  It was as if I could feel a memory of something lurking beneath the water, but it would not come close enough to the surface to reveal itself to me.  I could have stood there all afternoon looking at it, but Mr. Dean finally urged me to move on.  On the way out, I bought a postcard of this painting so that I could forever have that moment within arm's length.  As Blondie put it in  Picture This , "... a small remembrance of something more solid."  I think back and I'm reminded of showing the postcard to my parents and trying to explain to them what I had felt inside.  It was one of the earliest memories I have of being unable to express myself.  In December of 2000 I flew home to visit my family during the holidays.  Shortly before Christmas I met my friend, Tacy, for lunch and we drove by the DOM.  I asked her to stop.  I ran into the museum with Tacy struggling to keep up. I'm sure she thought I was insane, but she knew me well and understood it was me just living my life passionately from one moment to the next.  At first, I was frightened that it was no longer there, but then I turned the corner and rrealized that they had just moved it.  I am sure that I must have smiled to myself, but as I stared into the painting, I sumberged my consciousness into silence.  This painting was a visual meditation for me.  I didn't even notice Tacy walking in behind me.  Once again, I was unable to communicate to Tacy the emotion that this feeling stirred inside me.  As we walked out, I found a print in the gift shop.  It's now framed and hanging in my bedroom.  I noticed that there is now a book on this painting and its strange history.  I need to buy a copy and put it on my bookshelf next to that postcard from 22 years ago.  I was reading a book by Julia Cameron once and she wrote that creativity is God expressing Himself through us.  I think she's right.  When I'm creating without thinking about what I'm doing, everything seems to flow and fit perfectly.  When I let my ego and logic enter the mix, the message becomes cloudy.  There is something about this painting that still speaks to me.  It's as if it speaks a dead language to me that no one else can hear.  Each time I look at that print on my wall, it seems that whatever it is trying to reveal to me is coming closer to the surface.  With patience, maybe one day I will know the answer.

       GOD HATES SHRIMP   My friend, Ryan, sent me  urlLink this clever little  link that I know y'all will enjoy.  Click on the link to see the images.  Photoshop is a beautiful thing!   "Shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, mussels, all these are an abomination before the Lord, just as gays are an abomination. Why stop at protesting gay marriage? Bring all of God's law unto the heathens and the sodomites. We call upon all Christians to join the crusade against Long John Silver's and Red Lobster. Yea, even Popeye's shall be cleansed. The name of Bubba shall be anathema. We must stop the unbelievers from destroying the sanctity of our restaurants.  T-SHIRTS NOW AVAILABLE  Leviticus 11:9-12 says:  9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.  10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:  11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.  12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.   Deuteronomy 14:9-10 says:  9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:  10 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you."

       I WAS ASKED TO SAVE THE CHILDREN, BUT I SAID THAT I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT    A girl representing Save The Children came to my door and spoke with me about sponsoring a child.  I believe she was on the up and up, but I wanted to think about it.  I don't like to make financial commitments off the cuff.  Evidently you had to make your decision right now.  She had halitosis and I found it distracting.  I wanted to offer her gum or a breath mint and wondered if that was why she had not signed more people up.  I told her that I would go to the Web site and research the information.  If I felt inclined, I would sign up that way.  She thanked me for listening to her.  I guess some people just close the door in her face.  I admire her for getting out and doing something she believes in.  She doesn't have to do it.  Still, what if she is getting paid to do this?  What if she is doing it for community service for getting caught drinking and driving.  I think I'll choose to believe her intentions were of the altruistic variety.

       ALL QUIET ON THE ATLANTA FRONT   All the doors and windows are open and I can hear the insects outside.  Spring is here.  The darkness has enveloped my surroundings except for the soft globe of light from my antique-style pharmacy lamp on my desk.  It reminds of a big angler fish in the deep.  Right now, I like being alone.  I am enjoying it.  I like the company of my thoughts without anyone else disrupting the flow of our conversation.  In a moment, perhaps, I may rise from my chair and spin around the room in time to my own internal music.  I may decide not to.  I like to have my options open.   When I arrived home this evening, the sky was still blushing with pink in the West.  The street was silent except for the sound of birds singing lullabies to one another as they prepared for sleep.  Do birds dream, I wonder?  I just had to sit outside on the porch and listen to their night music.  I closed my eyes and let myself drift.  Jeff will be home late tonight. I'll be happy to see him and hear him talk about his day.  He works long hours this time of year and is usually very tired.  I admire him for that.  I couldn't do his job.  I sent him an e-mail a few moments ago to ask him when he willbe home and if he wants me to fix him something for dinner.  There is nothing like food waiting for you to say, "I appreciate you.  Keep up the good work."

       MY BARBER, RANDY   I received a hair cut tonight.  That sounds peculiar.  I received a hair cut.  It makes the art of cutting one's hair sound like receiving an enema or a flu shot.  I digress.  Randy cuts my hair.  I won't go to anyone else.  He's cut my hair for four years.  He knows me.  He knows my hair.  He has character and I trust his judgment.  In the short story that I'm working on, the main character, Brad, goes to someone like Randy.  I wrote something to the effect of Brad trusted Randy's character with his life.  Tim from my writer's group felt that was inappropriate based upon his life experiences.  "I wouldn't trust my hairdresser with my life," he said.  "Obviously you don't go to Randy," I thought.  Think about it.  You let someone pick up a pair of scissors and move them around your face, scalp and neck.  That's what I call trust.    We had a good time tonight.  I guess you could say we have our little jokes about some things that we have talked about over the years.  For example, Jeff thinks my hair looks better longer in his opinion, but sometimes I like to cut it short or have a flat-top.  I stay active and in the summertime, it's much easier to manage.  I truly believe that I am a lesbian trapped in a man's body sometimes.  Randy once chased me down the street with scissors because as I walked out the door, he saw a small bit of hair that he had missed.  He likes his work to be perfect.  One day Randy may move.  As much as I love him, I know I'll have to let him go and be free.  No one will ever replace him, but I can't drive to Miami for a hair cut either.  Randy mentioned that a friend said that he was much more fun to be around now than he was in college.  He said it was because he's more comfortable with himself.  I agreed with him.  I mentioned that being in a relationship changes your focus on things.  Since I'm not single, I don't ever think about making myself presentable in such a way as to attract romantic or sexual interest.  Over the past few months, I have been surprised several times when I have met people who have expressed an interest in dating me or something more immediate.  It had shocked me on every occasion because I don't even think about anyone looking at me in that way.  "Why shouldn't they," Randy asked.  "It's not an esteem issue," I said.  "I'm just focused on different things and it's like jumping the rails."  We both laughed because he knew what I was trying to say.

       GOOD WRITERS GROUP MEETING TONIGHT   We had a great meeting tonight.  A new guy named Charles showed up and shared a very interesting story.  He only read the first three pages, but I'm dying to read the rest of it.  He has the most interesting writing voice.  It sounds very classical or like literature.  Tim and I went on and on about two minor characters, but they introduce us through their words to one important character in the story as well as the main character sitting behind them.  I like the main character.  She's a saucy bitch!  I shared the next installment of my piece entitled "Exfoliation."  I put it of and put it off and finally I banged it out in about an hour before the meeting.  It actually turned out quite well.  So what was the big deal about?  I guess I have had my mind on my change in the work situation and little else as of late.  One of the characters uses some profanity, which doesn't sound like a big deal until you are reading it out loud to someone you have never met before.  I have been known to swap a choice word or two as of late, but I know a lot of different words and I like to use them.  It's rare to hear me cuss that much anymore.  It sort of bothers 2F's too.  Then I went on to write a sex scene, which is always a bit awkward too.  You wonder whether you should write "penis," "turgid member," "dick," or "throbbing cock."  It's a fine line that I walk between literature and pornography.  Charles gave me some very positive feedback.  Since it was his first meeting, he had not read the first part of the story and I didn't want to make him a prisoner of my story for half an hour.  Technically, it has some rough spots because I haven't had the opportunity to go back and edit it.  There was one part that I had a tough time getting down on paper.  I had the beginnig of the argument and I knew the ending so I wrote the ending and then the middle was easy to write.  I'm cocerned that I am so easily manipulated by myself.  Tim arrived a little bit late.  He was at a neighborhood association meeting or something similar.  (See my post from this morning.)  I can always rely on Tim to find technical typos.  It's definitely one of his gifts. It's also interesting how sometimes we can be in perfect agreement on feedback and other times we think as different as night and day or interpret something exactly opposite from one another.  I am thankful for that because then we are able to give a variety of opinions to other writers.  Utlimately, it's up to them to decide what to do with the feedback anyway.  Afterwards, we talked about our favorite writers and books that we hae read.  We challenged each other to do a book report on a book we have read within the next month.  We discussed having a Atlanta Gay Writers showcase of work related to gay pride on the Thursday before Gay Pride.  We also challenged each other to write a piece of no more than 2,000 words that has something to do with testosterone.  This should be interesting.

       NEW BLOGS ON LEFT SIDE   I added two new blogs today, which I thought were interesting.  One is  urlLink Spam Poetry  where the creative genius behind it composes poetry with the subject lines from spam each day.  The second is  urlLink Mikan Moblog - Everyday Japan, Through A Lens .  The creator posts a different picture of something that caught his eye in Japan each day.  His exposures and composition are great and the subject matter is interesting each day.

       MY PEPSI SPOT   While looking for a work-related file this morning, I came across a Pepsi commercial I wrote about ten years ago when I was trying to get a job as a copywriter for an ad agency.  I thought y'all might enjoy reading it. Here it is:  	PEPSI SPOT  SCENE 1  INT.  BEDROOM LATE NIGHT  Door bell rings.  EDDIE wakes up and turns on lamp on bedside table.   SCENE 2  INT.  FOYER OF APARTMENT  Knocking on front door.  EDDIE opens front door and JACK walks in.  	JACK.   Eddie what took you so long.  My whole life is falling down around me!  	EDDIE.   	(Drowsy.)   It's three o'clock in the morning, Jack.  	JACK.   I can't sleep, Eddie.  It's Sheila.  I dropped her off after our date and she says to me, "I had a great time.  Call me."  	EDDIE.   Are you bleeding?  	JACK.   I guess it was her tone it just sounded funny, you know.  I know Sheila is the one for me because the first time I saw her I felt woozy and heard a ringing in my ears.  	EDDIE   	(Moving to Kitchen.)   Jack, she threw water on your face after the filing cabinet fell on your head.   SCENE 3  INT.  KITCHEN  	JACK.   	(Following EDDIE.)   Don't trivialize my feelings, Eddie.  This is love.  The kind that kingdoms have been lost over.  	EDDIE.   	(Opening refrigerator.)   I thought you just took her to a dinner and a movie?  	JACK.   I know how I feel, but how do I know if she feels the same.  Tell me the truth, Ed.  Do you find me sexually attractive?  EDDIE pops can of Pepsi open.  	EDDIE.   Here.  Drink this.  You're delirious.  	JACK.   Thanks.  I am a bit parched.  JACK drinks Pepsi as EDDIE gently moves a furniture dolly under JACK’s feet and pushes him out of the kitchen and   SCENE 4  INT.  FOYER  out the front door.  JACK finishes Pepsi and hiccups.  	JACK.   Excuse me.   	(Hands EDDIE the Pepsi can.)   So do you think I'm cute or what?  EDDIE slams door closed.  He turns off light and walks away.  	JACK.   	(Through door.)   So do this mean you don't think I'm cute?  Eddie?  Oh, Ed!   FADE TO BLACK.

       ADVENTURES AT NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION MEETINGS   I take minutes at our local neighborhood association.  It's not the most exciting job, but it gives me something to do and keeps my mind from wandering off.  The meeting is supposed to last for 90 minutes, but inevitably runs beyond that.  It begins with asking neighborhood association virgins and new neighbors to introduce themselves.  Next, people from various organizations will make some presentations about something they are doing that may affect the neighborhood.  This might be a presentation from a developer or someone who is planning a fun run around the park.  Then we have various committees that report on the projects they are working on.  Committees cover parks and recreation, education and children's issues, transportation, land use and zoning, history, etc.  As secretary and Web person (it has a real title, I just forget what it is) I was surprised to find out that I have a budget.  Granted, most of it goes toward Web hosting, etc., but it did make me feel official.  I used to refrain from going to these meetings because they sometimes get rowdy.  A hot topic comes up and people began to have  passionate discussions  about the topic.  We've had some new people attend who have never come back, but I think the meetings have gotten less rowdy on the whole.  Last night we were a little rowdy again.  We are a historic neighborhood and we have found that this designation has taken some of our rights away and given them to the Urban Design Commission (UDC).  However, just in the last year or so, we have lost three historic houses.  Some would say that the historic designation has prevented more than three from being lost and others would say that three is too many.  I don't know the answer.  It was troubling to see the land use and zoning co-chair receiving some heat for things that are out of his control, but in the hands of the UDC.  There was a comment made about "secret meetings" behing held, which is not the case because the meeting details were mentioned at prior meetings.  All in all, it just led me to believe that we need to put something together to explain what the benefits and limitations are of our historic designation.  We are currently working on some guidelines to present to the UDC of how we would like the process revised to give us more informaition and a say in some of the approvals for new construction, etc.  At least people are talking about it.  That's the first step.

       NEIL TENNANT IS FOREVER THE SAGE OF WISDOM   This afternoon was a bit frustrating, but I successfully accomplished my main goal for today.  Now, if I could just get the sound card working again.  I became so frustrated, I went outside and jumped rope.  The guy in Parade was right.  It is an intense little cardio workout.  I did ten minutes and it is reportedly the equivalent of running for 30 minutes.  I was dripping with sweat after ten minutes and exhausted so it must be true.  I made a chicken caesar salad and sat down to eat before I go to the GPNA meeting tonight.  I decided to read the Questions section on the Pet Shop Boys Web site.  I always find it entertaining.  I was not disappointed.  Neil is giving advice to the lovelorn again.  See below:   Rhiannon From New Zealand:  Hi, umm you know how I go out with someone who usually isn't very nice to me (wont talk to me, be in the same room as me, or let me kiss him etc), well I'm still with him even though on the whole Im not happy, I just feel somewhat paralysed when it comes to trying to leave him, I've been with him for 9 months and I just cant bring myself to break up with him even though he's an ***hole, I feel so stupid, but yeah. I guess I just stay with him in the hope that sometimes he'll be nice to me, like he occasionally is. Anyway, last week I met someone that I felt I clicked with right away, he is absolutely gorgeous and has a really nice, kind personality and whats more, I make him laugh all the time which is really great. I'm a pretty weird person and not everyone finds the things I say amusing, like my boyfriend will just be like "riiiiiiight" and look at me like i'm mental, whereas this new guy is cracking up laughing. It makes me feel really good inside. Even though I've only known him for a week, I havent felt this way about anyone before. Finally, someone who treats me like a human being. I don't know what to do about the situation - I don't know if I even want to leave my boyfriend because he has been nice to me all last week (probably because he knows im interested in the new guy) and if things could be like that all the time I'd sooo stay...I don't even know if the other guy has a girlfriend...and would I be able to gain the courage to leave my boyfriend anyway? Sorry if the length of this message freaks you out, I've noticed most of the long questions are really mental and make no sense...maybe like this one? oops!   Neil: Play  "I don't know what you want but I can't give it any more" and then go with the new guy! N

       WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?   I came across  urlLink this link  while surfing at lunch today.  It's a test to show you what type of person that you are attracted to.  It's very extensive and the analysis afterwards is very comprehensive.  I was a bit surprised to find that I am picky and sucker for good looks.  I'm not sure if I agree with this, but evidently the face that I found most attractive is not the most main stream.  All in all, I think it's pretty accurate for an assessment just on instinct alone without getting to know the person.  It was a relief to find out that my partner fits my type to a "T." Oh yeah, big smiles are a real turn-on to me.

       JUST A NOTE ON INTERNET MATCHMAKING SERVICES   I have a problem.  A year or two ago I signed up on a new site to access full news articles instead of just the first paragraph.  There must have been some information on the site that I deemed valuable because I don't believe I ever went back since I cannot remember what the name of the site was.  Futhermore, I would not have registered as I despise trying to keeping up with billions and billions of user ID's and passwords.  It's bad enough that everyone requires a different password combination ranging from four to eight characters and various alpha numeric combinations with upper and lower case sensitivity.  Add this to the fact that I am somewhat paranoid and choose such obscure choices from the intimate details of super heroes' secret identities' lives that even I cannot remember what the password is.  Anyway, about a year ago this Web site revamped it's format completely and I started receiving periodic "matches."  Yes, little mug shots of romantic hopefuls starting appearing in my in box with  brief descriptions of their favorite restaurants, sexual position and just how sporty yet casual they are.  Ever curious about what type of people use matchmaking services, I clicked on the link and began to find out more about these people.  It's very addictive.  It's even better than going to the airport to watch people because these guys tell you all of their business.    Most of these guys seem pretty normal, but I do question some of the pictures they choose to include.  They vary somewhere between a Colt cover model and an APB photo that you would see on an emergency news break.  "Spike has escaped from prison!"  Today there was a guy who is very much into bodybuilding.  He lists that looks are most important.  (Imagine that!)  He says he's 34, but his skins looks more water tight than a seal's behind.  I kept trying to figure out what seemed odd about his face and then I realized that it looks as if his hair is molded plastic and his eye brows are drawn on.  He looks so unnatural.  Why would anyone want to look that way when they mention they are looking for "something real?"  Occasionally, you see the odd serial killer with a picture that looks like it was taken in the half light of a phone booth.  There has also been an acquaintance of mine that have actually turned up on the list.  "Straight-acting my ass!"  Others just make me talk to my monitor.  "You're a freek!  F-R-E-E-K!  Freek!"  It brings out a judgmental quality in me that I'm not sure is congruent with spiritual goals, but he was a freek.  Really!  Some guys are very straight forward and I think one of the better ones I saw was the guy in the park with his python.  (Yes, it really was a python.  I am not using a metaphor.)  He stated that sex was important to him, but he listed many other things he looked for in a "hook-up" or "potential relationship" that were healthy and conducive to a relationship of a few months to a lifetime.  However, there was another one that actually lives in my neighborhood that worried me.  I've never seen or met this guy, but he seemed very nice, but his entire description revolved around how his sexual position of choice was on the receiving end.  He was a bottom boy and and a bottom boy only.  This bit of information seemed to make it into every entry no matter if he was describing his favorite type of food, spiritual views or whether he had pets.   I thought he might be a good match for my friend, M., but since I did not know M.'s preferred sexual position, I thought it might be best to let it go.  Perhaps one day this guy will expand his world view beyond being a catcher and realize that a healthy relationship must include other interests too.  If I ever run into this guy at a neighborhood party where we are drinking and someone makes a toast, I'm going to have to look at this guy and say, "Bottoms up!"  I hope I don't spew wine or beer out my nostril holes.  This leads to my problem.  Reading these ads brings out my "inner yenta."  I find myself wanting to match some of these guys up with some of my single friends.  For example, there once was an ad for a nice guy who was very well balanced.  He was looking for someone to spend time with that liked to garden, hiking, movies, travel, dinner, etc.   That's good and all, but then he went on to write that his dog was a big part of his life and whomever he dated would have to understand that he and Skipper (his dog) came as a packaged deal.  It was just like a McDonalds commercial.  I got all misty-eyed and started going through my mental rolodex looking for a dog lover to marry him off to.  Then I stopped and thought about it for a moment.  If I contact this guy, what am I going to say?  I mean I can say that I'm in a committed relationship and I'm not looking for a three way or outside sex, but I have a wonderful friend I would like to introduce him to.  I know what I would think if I received an e-mail like that so I just let it go.  Occasionally I'll be out with friends and I'll look at one of them and think, "Gosh, he's a great guy who wants to be in a relationship.  He's smart, witty, good looking, fit and emtionally and financially stable.  Other than his compulsion for buying old toilets and refinishing them into garden planters, he's really a great catch.  Who else do I know that is single?"  Then I think of boynxtdoor17534 and I wonder if he ever found someone and if that someone is treating Skipper right.  I'm sorry.... hold on a minute.  Okay.  I'm okay now.  It's just that Skipper deserves the best, you know?  I know I should probably stop the e-mails from being sent to me because there are other things to make better use of my time, but that's just too much work.  Well, this is not true. I just scanned the entire e-mail, which is a lot of work, and noticed that I can stop the e-mails by clicking on a link at the bottom.  I need to let this go.  If not for my sake, then for the sake of Skipper.

       I KNOW VICTORIA'S SECRET.  DO YOU?   I had to go to the mall today.  I don't usually go to the mall these days unless I have a purpose, which is a word I have difficulty saying with a straight face because I always think of the therapist in Christopher Durang's play,  Beyond Therapy , who always says that she has come on porpoise when she really means purpose.  This has nothing to do with what I'm trying to tell you.  I stopped at Perimeter Mall, which I have never been inside in the entire seven years that I have lived in Atlanta.  I found this odd, but kept moving forward toward my goal.  I walked into Victoria's Secret as if I'm invading the Middle East.  My stride is swift and every step I take is with porpoise, I mean purpose.  I approach the counter in the back and I say, "Madame, I need a gift certificate."  She smiles and says, "Certainly.  What amount would you like to put on it?"  "$20.00!"  The clerk begins maniuplating the card and the register to make the magic happen and I notice that she keeps looking up at me and smiling and then quickly looking away.  It suddenly dawns on me that she is checking me out.  This always takes me off guard because I just don't think about anyone looking at me in a desirable way.  Granted, I'm certainly not the Elephant Man, but I just don't think about looking for a mate or sex partner these days, let alone in a store full of women's lingerie.  She put the gift card in a tiny little shopping bag.  I signed my receipt.  She giggled.  I thanked her and I was on my way.  I breathed a sigh of relief as I left the store and made my way toward Bloomingdales to exit the mall.  I smiled upon thinking of how much I had accomplished today.  About that time, I saw two high school girls in private school uniforms.  They had on matching plaide skirts and looked like Britney Spears seconds at an outlet mall clearance sale.  I suddenly wondered if they were wearing panties underneath their skirts.  I looked down at the microscopic shopping bag from Victoria's Secret.  The irony was not lost on me.

       SHOULD WE CHOOSE THE SEX OF OUR BABIES?   I had a busy, but productive day and stopped by the gym on the way home.  Every senior citizen in Atlanta was there and I had to do my circuit in reverse.  After completing my workout, I noticed a Newsweek magazine on the wall about choosing the sex of babies.  Evidently there is some concern about the government banning these new scientific procedures that have very good results.  Ironically, they are banned in Europe and Asia especially where fetuscide and infantcide of female babies is still disturbingly high.  There is some concern that the male to female ratio will be skewed if these methods continue, but statistics show that the percentages are pretty even.  Shockingly, 38%pf most expecting parents want a boy while only 27% want a girl and the rest don't care.  Perhaps they could compromise and want a gay boy who likes to dress up in girls' clothes.  Would you want to choose your baby's sex?

       MY UNIQUE FRIENDSHIP WITH BELINDA CARLISLE   Okay, I hace to confess.  I have had an ongoing love-hate relationship with Belinda Carlisle since I was 13.  It's true.  It all began when I was lying on the couch watching  Entertainment Tonight  back in the fall of 1981 and I saw an interview with the Go-Go's and saw a brief clip of their video for  Our Lips Are Sealed .  I felt just like Lauren [Julie McCoy from the  Loveboat ] Tewes with a bag of white powder being dangled just out of her reach.  By Christmas I had extorted enough money from my mother to score a copy of  Beauty And The Beat  from Wal-mart.  For the next six years, the sound of We Got The Beat would be a normal fixture in my family's life.  It was, in fact, a Go-Go's video,  Head Over Heels , that first attracted my little sister to the television.  She crawled over to the entertainment center and pulled herself up to view the epileptic editing and proceeded to slobber all over the glass and the afore mentioned Ms. Carlisle.    Belinda, or Babe as she affectionately known to those close to her, sometimes seems to do and say things that just make me want to slap her hard enough to make her eyes cross.  It's like she is PMS woman and she activates her super powers by declaring, "Bitch on!"  However, her dedication to helping animals and people with aids has been impressive.  Back in 1994, she and the rest of the Go-Go's came to JR's in Dallas to sign autographs before their performance at one of the Christmas EDGE concerts in Dallas.  They were originally supposed to work the bar and serves drinks for charity, but something changed.  Today, we were on good terms.  I have a MP3 player in my car so I had recorded every Belinda Carlisle song onto a CDR in MP3 format and played it in my car this afternoon.  I'm very anal about it all.  You see, I make separate folders for each individual album and put them in sequential order.  However, I normally make one  Singles  or  Greatest Hits  folder, which will be first.  I typically just want to hear the hits.  I will put them all in sequential order and throw in some rare promo singles into the mix depending upon my mood.  This would include singles that were released to radio for promotional purposes only, but were never available in a store to be purchased as a single. This includes both domestic and international singles and promos.  After all the albums, I will include a folder for remixes, one for soundtrack cuts that were not included on any albums and a folder for live versions. B-sides are typically relegated to the album folder that corresponds to the single the B-side accompanied.    Today I played one of my favorite songs, which is  California .  Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys sings back up and it was written by the guys whoe wrote Like A Virgin and True Colors.  Here is my favorte line from the song:   I remember I was in the tanning salon When I heard that River Phoenix was gone.   Brilliant!

       MIRROR, MIRROR ON THE WAYLL...   I was undressing to get into the shower this morning and I caught a glimpse of my body in the mirror.  I stopped dead in my tracks.  I carefully traced every line while my heart raced and then smiled.  I liked what I saw.  My pecs are popping out again and my arms are toning up.  My love handles have disappeared and you can see the definition of my obliques and it's just flat as all get out.  I thought, "Now there is one sexxy beast."  It was hard to keep my hands off myself.I looked myself in the mirror and said, "And that is why you gave up the evil french fry and emabraced the low-carb alternative lifestyle."    Then I got in the shower because by that time I was running late.

       FUN AND GAMES   Last night we went over to S. & P.'s house for game night and pizza.  Joan (Conversations With A Woman) was there as well.  We poured some beers and got out Trivial Pursuit and got down to business.  We decided to play boys against the girls in order to save time.  Keep in mind that S. & P. are very competitive.  Winning is everything.  They are very good too and took off with a nice lead.  I'm not sure when it happened, but 2F's and I started picking up pieces of pie like nobody's business.  We'd get strange questions and just sort of reason it out with ourselves and get them right.  Sometimes the questions would just be some obscure piece of trivia that only my diabolical mind would know.  Before you know it, we were in the center trying to get that final question right.  S. was having a very difficult time with this.  They finally got the last piece of pie and landed by exact count in the center circle.  At this point, Jefffifer doesn't care who wins the game as long as it ends soon.  Meanwhile Joan has gone downstairs to the basement to put her laundry in the dryer.  S. & P. decide to take the question without her.  "If we don't know it, we'll wait for Joan."  The question was something to do with a soccer player from Uganda.  S. & P. are stumped.  They call down to Joan in the basement.  She calls back up from downstairs, "Idi Amin!"  As fate would have it, she was right and they won the game.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  This went down in history as one of my favorite stories.  Send the girls your congratulations!

       JEFFFIFER GOES TO THE ATLANTA AUTO SHOW   We went to the auto show today.  2F's wanted to check out SUV's for his pending used book store, but I think it was just an excuse to go.  The World Congress Center is huge.  You just walk for days.  I think it was just built as an excuse to have a lot of escalators.  I did not take any pictures with my cell phone, but I saw several buttocks that Troy probably would have taken pictures of.  We walked in and looked at the Ford vehicles first.  The Mustang convertible looked redneck sexxy.  It still has it after all of these years.  I was intrigued by the Ford GT until I found out it retails for $140,000.  I looked at the new Miatas.  Theyc ome with a Bose stereo sytem.  They are basically the same design, but more plastic.  We checked out the BMW section.  The Z4 Roadster is very nice and only retails at $35,000.  I like the Z4, but have questioned if whether I should step up to a 3 series convertible since I would have a back seat to transport more than two people.  It retails for $45,000.  However, the M3 convertible, retailing at $56,000 really spoke to me.  It was oslo blue on the outside with sort of a burnt orange accent on the interior.  It looke sharper than it sounds.  I wondered if it would feel bigger than 2F's M3, but it didn't.  It felt pretty much like when I drive the M3.  The minicoopers were pretty impressive. There is more room in those things than I imagined.  2F's seems to have his mind set on the Nissan Xterra for a work vehicle.  He likes the yellow one and I must say, I think it's the best fit for what he wants to do.  They are wide and have a lot of space in back and with the back seats folded down.  They look sharp too.  Plus, the price is very reasonable.  I saw a Dodge Viper and thought of Adam.  We came across two old model T's and I thought of aunt who recently died.  When my grandfather died, he left an old model T that he bought and planned to restore to my uncle.  The last time I heard, the model T was in his garage.  Upon his death, it was supposed to be passed on to me.  However, since my uncle mishandled my grandmother's estate when she died and we no longer talk to him, I wonder what will happen to my grandfather's model T.  I don't know where I would put it if I did inherit it, but I have strong feelings about it.  My grandfather died when I was four and I have vague memories of him.  In my mind, the model T connects me with my grandfather.  If I could restore it to the way he would have restored it, perhaps I could give something back to him.  A couple of years ago, I scanned some old family photographs while I was home at Christmas.  There were a few of my older sister and I when we lived on Kerry Drive in Arlington, Texas.  There were some of my mother and father dating when they were teenagers.  There was one of my grandfather and I playing a Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron game.  When I saw it, tears came to my eyes.  I have no idea why.  I'm not the teary-eyed type, but it just made me miss him and grieve the relationship that I never had with my grandfather.  I wonder what kind of man I would have been like if he had lived longer and we had developed more of a relationship?  After the auto show, 2F's and I walked back to the car through Centenial Park.  We stopped and sat on a bench to watch the dancing water fountain show.  It was still warm with a comfortable breeze in the air.  The water danced to the Theme From Chariots Of Fire by Vangelis.  I watched images of the Justice League of America on the video screen on the outside of the CNN building through the fountains.  I looked to my right out toward where the new aquarium is being built.  The sky seemed wide and big without any hills.  It reminded me of Texas and home.  I looked back at 2F's watching the water moving in time with music and thought how nice it is just to spend time with your best friend by yourself.

       INTERESTING CONVERSATION AT CHURCH   As many of you may know, I've been participating in a self-study course called  The Quest  since January of 2003.  The first course is a year-long study and the second set of three courses are shorter.  I have already completed the  The Quest For Meaning  and now I'm studying  The Quest For Wholeness .  Some of us who are completing these courses meet at 10am every Sunday morning before church to discuss what we think about the reading and course work.    Today P. mentioned that she couldn't understand how some churches could use religion to control people instead of helping them establish a personal, spiritual connection with God.  Before I could stop myself, I added that I was very disturbed that religion is still be used today to forward political agendas.  I gave the example of how the gay marriage issue is being used by conservatives to entice conservative votres to the polls in an us verus them mentality.  Where as the real issues that Christians should be concerned with, say hunger in America, helping people find jobs, children without healthcare, etc., are being ignored.  Furthermore, Jesus would never have allowed anyone to ignite hatred toward any other group of people in his name.  A woman spoke up and said that we shouldn't pass judgment on others.  I told her that I appreciated her saying that, but qualified my earlier comments by reminding her that when Pat Robinson and Billy Graham stated that 9/11 occurred becaue of homosexuals, that was not the promotion of Christian brotherly love.  Another lady piped up and said that she heard a program on NPR where they interviewed one of the authors of the  Left Behind  series of books and he proudly stated that he ran into the Dali Lama in Israel and went up to him and asked if he had accepted Jesus Christ as his personal saviour.  She said, "Why would you say that to the Dali Lama?  Are you out of your fucking mind?"  We all laughed.  It's nice to be able to cuss and discuss in Sunday School.

       GEORGE MICHAEL DOESN'T NEED YOUR STINKIN' MONEY   As some of you may know, George Michael is releasing his first new album in several years next week.  According to  urlLink RememberThe80's.com ,  Patience  will be his last traditional release.  From this point on he will release material online for free since he no longer needs to earn money from his work.  (Interesting...)  However, anyone who downloads his music has the option to make a donation to a selection of charities. Mr. Michael aslo wants to turn his back on fame.  It will be interesting to see how the music industry responds.  I didn't care for  Freek , the first single he released from this album back in 2002.  Evidently no one else did either.  His second follow up,  Shoot The Dog , which poked fun at the way Tony Blair seemed to be a puppet to George W. Bush was received a little more favorably.  I don't think I've ever heard it.  The new single,  Amazing , has received some favorable reviews and sales.  It has been compared to the likes of  Jesus As A Child .

       LIVE AID OR MEMOREX?   According to  urlLink RemembeThe80's.com , the Live Aid concert will be released on DVD at Christmas in order to stop illegal pirate copies from being sold on the Internet.  Sir Bob Geldof hopes that the release will earn a few million pounds for the charity 19 years after the event.  I wonder if the DVD will include all 16 hours.  It's been awhile since we saw Phil Collins perform in London and then hop on the concorde to perform again in the USA.  Remember Madonna performing Holiday just after the nude photos of her came out and were published in Playboy and Penthouse?  She said she wasn't taking *@#* off that day.  Plus, I'd love to see Mick Jagger pull off Tina Turner's leather miniskirt while performing the Jacksons' State Of Shock.  (No costume malfunction there, Justin. ;))  Gosh, 1985 seems just like yesterday.

       SPIRITUALLY-CHALLENGING FRIDAY   2F's came home from work yesterday and he was physically and mentally exhausted from a week in government.  I knew he was tired because he was like shark skin.  You could stroke him one way and he was smooth as glass. You stroke him the other way and your hand is sliced to ribbons.  Let me clarify that there was no actual stroking going on, I was just using an analogy.  Almost everything I said or did last night resulted in some editorial comment.  I found myself wanting to leave the house and drive to Canada, but I just breathed deeply.  When you care about someone and you are close, they are going to take things out on you that they will not take out on other people.  The odds are just in your favor because they spend more time with you.  They don't intentionally mean to anger your or hurt your feelings.  It's just a Betty Ford Detox without the Betty Ford Clinic and Liz and Liza.  Eventually, his mood evened out and he went to bed early.  I wouldn't want his job.  Sometimes, I wonder what he satisfaction he receives from it.  I did some reading before bed last night and the ancients used to believe that everyone had an angel or higher self.  It was believed that if you had an disagreement with someone, you could write to their higher self or angel and ask that all disharmony be dissolved.  I'll have to try this sometime.

       A GREAT OPPORTUNITY   I spoke with one of the realtors in the neighborhood who has been referring me business.  I told him last week that I would bring some marketing flyers for some of his listed properties.  What is a marketing flyer you ask?  It's basically a one-page flyer that lists information about the property along with several different financing options.  It allows a potential buyer to have a good estimate of how much the home will cost.  It still shocks me at the number of people who begin looking at houses that are way out of their price range because they have no idea of what their payment will be.  So I call the realtor and ask if I can bring some by his office on Saturday afternoon and he said yes.  I had already gone to his Web site and he has nine listed.  They take about half an hour to put together with all the calculations and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR).  Fortunately, I made a cheat sheet in Microsoft Excel that does most of the calculations for me, but the APR is time consuming.  I bought some paper to match my business cards so they should look nice.  I also made some calls about the ugly yellow business cards and voicemail box.  It's all coming together and it seems so easy. Is it really easy or have I just found something that I enjoy doing?

       FICKLE ME   I had a nice lunch with an ambitious, young realtor yesterday.  As we got to know each other better, it was revealed that we both had the same marketing ideas, which leads me to believe that I'm on track.  Is it the  Celestine Prophecy  that states when you begin to focus on a situation, be open and the information/confirmation will come to you?  Anyway, she gave me a bit of information that I was missing and I gave her a some of information she was missing.  I spoke with Robert yesterday.  There have been some things going on in the office that sadden me to hear.  Perhaps it's best that I was working from home this week.  Still, I'm planning to focus on doing my job, coming in to check mail and turn in files, visit with the processors and the receoptionist and leave.  I've always felt that we should live our lives like a pop song on the radio; give them a taste and then leave them begging for more.  On my way home, I stopped by Office Max to pick up some office supplies I needed for the home office.  The HP 3330 had been reduced to the same price as Staples.  I actually turned around to make sure that I was not on Candid Camera.  It was like God said, "Hey, give that boy a printer/copier/scanner/fax!"  Ironically, after comparing it to the HP Officejet 7110, I went with the Officejet.  Yes, I know waxed on about the glories of laser machines over inkjet units, but the functionality of the 7110 just smoked the 3330.  It's much faster and I can just use the ink cartridge refill kit that I have.  (It actually works quite well for me!)  Somehow I actually got the huge box into the Miata and it's sitting on my desk.  I feel like a middleaged man with a small penis, but a big red sports car.  Mmmm... delicious!

       HOW TO MAKE THE PERFECT DOLLOP   During the holidays, I saw this short article in the Sunday coupons and found it worth clipping.  My dollops in the past have always resembled people who have skydived without a parachute.  This important message is brought to you by Cool Whip.  01. Swirl sppon, hold upright, through thawed Cool Whip, creating rippled surface on the whipped topping.  02. Dip spoon into rippled whipped topping and scoop up a heaping spoonful, maintaining rippled surface.  03. Gently touch spoon onto surface of dessert and release whipped topping gradually, pulling spoon up into a crowning tip.

       AN E-MAIL FROM GINGER DELACRUZ   E-mail is so exciting!  Yesterday, I received an e-mail from Ginger Delacruz.  When I saw the name, I paused and quickly perused the hallow halls of my memory.  Who is Ginger Delacruz?  Was she a former teacher, student, friend?  Did I shag her during a drunken fraternity party in college?  No, I wasn't in a fraternity, but I did shag some frat boys oddly enough.  Why is Gigner Delacruz e-mailing me?  Why choose me as compared to every other sexy beast on the planet?  I soon found myself sliding down the path of pondering forever and endless billions of galaxies in the universe.  I had to pinch myself to ground myself down into reality again.  I smiled and considered the possibilities of my new friendship with Ginger Delacruz.  I imagined us e-mailing silly jokes back and forth to another.  I figured she lived in Central or South America, possibly L.A.  I imagined her with long brown hair with an auburn tint, short skirts with a slit up to her armpit, colorful haltar tops with white polka dots, red high heels for spontaneous flamenco demonstrations, thick, sultry lips that could suck a beach ball through a hypodermic needle and yes, even a flower in her hair.  We would fly back and forth to visit one another in our respective cities.  I would introduce her to my friends and say, "This is my new best friend, Ginger Delacruz."  My friends would be jealous, of course.  They don't know anyone who has a name that sounds like a star of Latin American She-Male vidoes.  Come to find out, she was just offering me a great discount on xanax by mail order.  It's very kind of her to extend the invitiation, but alas, I am not in need of antidepressants.  Sigh... it could have been beautiful.  Only the week before I had gotten my hopes over another possible new friend only to find out that she was pimping viagra.  I don't mess with that stuff.  The blood gets caught in your penis and it can't check out.  It's like a phallic roach motel.  I know boys who have gone to the emergency room to have their penis lanced to release the pressure and then fainted at the sight of their own blood.  You can put steroids and protein the queen, but you can't take the queen out of the... well, you get the picture.  Anyway, perhaps there is a hope.  I see that I have just received an e-mail from the sister of the King of Uganda.  The promise of a new day, aye?

       FRIDAY AM   Well, I've been up since seven o'clock this morning working. There is still so much to organize and set up in a home office. I should be able to finish over the weekend and be ready to rock and roll on Monday.  I have a lunch with a realtor today.  Yesterday morning I went to a free seminar by a local realtor/mortgage broker.  (Yes, he is a hybrid.)  The sound was bad and he wasn't a dynamic speaker.  I was beginning to think that I had wasted four hours when he began giving some good ideas.  They were so simple, it was mind boggling.  Futhermore, it was all in alligment with the ideas that had been coming to me.  Weird, huh?  This keeps happening more and more.  I keep running into people that I am thinking of far from where they should be. If only I was receiving lotto numbers and the flight numbers of planes that are about to crash, perhaps I would feel that I could put this to better use.  However, I guess we die when we are supposed to.  It's kind of sexy to think that we are all walking around with a wide variety of expiration dates that lets our individual spirits know when our soul goes sour.  POOF!  Mary Jane bites the dust.  Anyway, I'm going to visit the local credit union today to find out if they are interested in the new neighbor welcome pack that I'm working on.  I'm going to find out about printing up some ugly yellow business cards that say that I help people get into their dream home with very little or no money down and less than perfect credit.  I also need to check into a 24/7 voice mail box and yard signs.  I will explain more later.  I'm feeling very inspired and jazzed this morning.  I'm a sexy beast!

       ROWDY REPUBLICANS IN COMMITTEE MEETINGS   I have mentioned that I have several friends that work in state government.  I was a bit surprised when I spoke with one of them today.  He was very down and disturbed.  I asked what was wrong and he said that he had been to three committee meetings today and was appalled by the behavior of several of the republican legislators. Now this friend is not one to party bash so I asked what happened.  My friend said that one legislator accused a lobbyist of trying to prevent his bill from going through and reamed him up and down in the middle of the committee meeting.  However, the meeting where Kathy Cox spoke out against the electronic voting machines that also provide a printed receipt disturbed him the most.  Ms. Cox advised against purchasing these machines because they are not currently certifiable and the republican legislator verbally attacked her.  An attorney addressed the legislators and reminded them that this machine would be illegal because it would discriminate against blind people.  First, a female legislator went off on him for telling them how to do their job.  Then another republican legislator asked why we had to worry about the blind people anyway.  We can't please everyone.  Evidently there were a few other remarks about blind people that brought audible gasps from the other people in the meeting.  My friend was very discouraged.  He is one of the few people I know that can look beyond this kind of bipartisan behavior to do the right thing for the people of Georgia.  I see his spirit slowly sinking with each week of this legislative session.  We are seeing this on a national level too.  What do you think should be done to correct this situation?

       THE GOAT: OR WHO IS SYLVIA?   I had a realtor mixer tonight, but forgot that I had already made plans to go to Actor's Express to see a play tonight with Tim.  2F's came with us.  I love the Kingplow Art Center.  I always dreamed that I would work as a Web designer there.  Perhaps, I loved the idea more than reality.  I digress.  The play was Edward Albee's The Goat: Or Who Is Sylvia?  It's about a family that finds out that the father has fallen in love with and is having an affair with a goat named Sylvia.  It's an absurd metaphor about complacency in America and what is and is not acceptable.  It was very well acted. In fact, the husband and wife were played by an actual husband and wife.  The gay son was a mincing fool.  It was very funny, but very intense.  The wife breaks a lot of things, which is symbolic of being unable to put the pieces of their life back together.  My favorite line was when the husband asked if the wife was going to knock over any more furniture.  She replies that she is, but she might need his help doing so.  All in all, it made me miss acting.  I used to be quite good, so I was told.  I miss getting lost in a character and trying out new movement and motivation each night.  Perhaps I should finish my monologue for the presentation at church.  I told a co-worker that I was planning to be Judas.   She looked at me quizzically for a moment and then asked, "Priest?"

       BEASTMOMMA'S ATTITUDE CHECK   I received a compliment on a reply from  urlLink Beastmomma .  I checked out her blog and I found her post for today very profound.  I think y'all will enjoy it.   Attitude Check   A few weeks after I turned 21, I had a serious of health adventues that often times found me on my bathroom floor crying and laying in bed feeling less than stellar. In those months, I was trying to finish up my undergraduate education and give the appearance of being okay. Recently, I found a journal that I had kept at that time.  In it I had written a list of things I would not take for granted: the taste of food, the space I take up, the weight of my hair on my shoulder, and feeling soothed by water from the shower.    When I broke my ankle and was taking vicadin (sp?) a few months before I turned 25, I had made a similiar list: standing in the shower, walking with two feet, seeing my foot on a regular basis.    Now I am at this strange juncture, I am still trying to life live as if each day counts. For me a large part of that is taking care of myself. That takes the form of going to the gym, trying to get enough sleep, springing on fancy bath products, and investing in good relationships.  In many ways, I feel like my parents have saved my life literally and figuratively.  As they imagine my future, is part of their marriage obession to make sure that they will be someone to sit with me on the floor when I am not well?   When we choose life, how do we go from being greatful for its mere existence to putting conditions on it.  I have a hard time with the eating healthy thing because I don't want to be restrictive. Sometimes, when I begin to lose weight and get smaller, I feel scared that I am disappearing.  I worry about wasting money on products that I enjoy instead of getting the generic brand.  There is some wonderful quote that says "live as if this is all there is." Being fully in the present definately requires a good bit of faith that you have whatever you need to go through the next thing.   How do you release the stress that you are not doing *right* by yourself or the universe? Where is the line between taking good care of yourself and being overindulgent?   What I know for sure is this: I am excited to go to MD this weekend for my second birthday party because I do love eating my mother's chole and having cookies and cream ice cream cake :)

       BILL MAHER ON VALENTINE'S DAY   My good friend, Tony, sent  urlLink this  to me and I thought it was worth sharing.  Enjoy!   The Boston Globe By Bill Maher, 2/14/2004   NEW RULE: You can't claim you're the party of smaller government, and then clamor to make laws about love. If there's one area I don't want the US overnment to add to its list of screw-ups, it's love.  On the occasion of this Valentine's Day, let's stop and ask ourselves:  What business is it of the state how consenting adults choose to pair  off, share xpenses, and eventually stop having sex with each other?  And why does the Bush administration want a constitutional amendment about weddings? Hey, birthdays are important, too -- why not include them in the great document? Let's make a law that gay people can have birthdays, but straight people get more cake -- you know, to send the right message to kids.   Republicans are always saying we should privatize things, like schools, prison, Social Security -- OK, so how about we privatize privacy? If the government forbids gay men from tying the knot, what's their alternative? They can't all marry Liza Minnelli.    Republicans used to be the party that opposed social engineering, but now they push programs to outlaw marriage for some people, and encourage it for others. If you're straight, there's a billion-five in  the budget to encourage and promote marriage -- including seed money to pay an old Jewish woman to call up people at random and say "So why aren't you married, Mr. Big Shot?"   But when it comes to homosexuals, Republicans sing "I Love You Just the Way You Oughta Be." They oppose gay marriage because it threatens or mocks -- or does something -- to the "sanctity of marriage," as if anything you can do drunk out of your mind in front of an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas could be considered sacred. Half the people who pledge eternal love are doing it because one of them is either knocked-up, rich or desperate, but in George Bush's mind, marriage is only a beautiful lifetime bond of love and sharing -- kind of like  what his Dad has with the Saudis.   But at least the right wing aren't hypocrites on this issue -- they really believe that homosexuality, because it says so in the Bible, is an "abomination" and a "dysfunction" that's "curable": they believe that if a gay man just devotes his life to Jesus, he'll stop being gay -- because the theory worked out so well with the Catholic priests.   But the greater shame in this story goes to the Democrats, because they don't believe homosexuality is an "abomination," and therefore their refusal to endorse gay marriage is a hypocrisy. The right are true believers, but the Democrats are merely pretending that they believe gays are not entitled to the same state-sanctioned misery as the rest of us. The Democrats' position doesn't come from the Bible, it's ripped right from the latest poll, which says that most Americans   are against gay marriage.   Well, you know what: Sometimes "most Americans" are wrong. Where's the Democrat who will stand up and go beyond the half measures of "civil  union" and "hate the sin, love the sinner," and say loud and clear:  `There IS no sin, and homosexuality is NOT an abomination. . . .The  only thing abominable about being gay is the amount of time you have  to put in at the gym.  But that aside, the law in this country should reflect that some people are just born 100 percent outrageously, fabulously, undeniably Fire Island gay, and that they don't need re-programming. They need a man with a slow hand.  Happy Valentine's Day everybody!  Bill Maher is host of "Real Time with Bill Maher."  © Copyright 2004 Globe Newspaper Company.

       CREATIVE SPELLING AWARD GOES TO ZESTO'S   After Joan and I went to Staples at lunch on Tuesday, we stopped by Zesto's, which is sort of like a local Dairy Queen here in Atlanta.  It was started by a Greek family and has your usual hamburger, chili dog and ice cream fare.  They have some nice soft serve chocolate non-fat yogurt and I wanted to treat Joan to something for being kind enough to pick me up and drive.  We placed our order and went down to the other end to wait for our frozen treats.  Joan ordered a brown cow, which is a soft serve cone dipped in chocolate and suspended until the chocolate shell dries.  The woman behind the counter was washing a metal milkshake container with the same speed and urgency as an archaeologist carefully unearthing a dinosaur femur with a tooth brush.  I looked up at the menu.  They have an item that is similar to a Dairy Queen blizzard.  One of the flavors stopped me in my tracks.  What the heck was that.  Then I understood and drew Joan's attention to it.  She looked at it a moment and then busted out laughing.  The flavor was Emma Nems (M&M's).  About that time, we heard some strange muttering behing the counter.   Jef: I beg your pardon?  Zesto's Woman: (Sounding like Billy Bob in  Slingblade .)  No chocolate in yogurt.  Jef: No chocolate in yogurt?  Zesto's Woman: Yogurt got no chocolate!  Jef: You have no chocoalte yogurt?  Zesto's Woman: It's too SOOOFT!  Jef: Oh.  Well, I dont' want any then.    Zesto's Woman: Niiiiii-luh!  Jef: You have vanilla?  Zesto's Woman: Shore 'nuff.  Jef: I'll have that then.   She then proceeded to make a vanilla yogurt cone, which was too soft and it made like the leaning Tower of Pisa that had fallen and could not get back up.  She then poured yogurt into a cup and poured the chocolate topping on top of my yogurt.  It immediately set and I had to fine a pick axe to eat my yogurt.  Ah... the luxury of frozen treats!

       GEORGIA GAY MARRIAGE-GO-ROUND CONTINUES   I have friends who work at the Capitol here in Atlanta so I get the scoop on everything.  It's great fun because there are a lot of stupid people that are elected to public office.  Those of you who know me can affirm that I just don't call people stupid very often so if I do, they are really stupid.  One of my other friends asked me about the gay marriage bill that is currently in consideration in the Georgia State Legislature. The first bill introduced was the diesel version called SR 595, which sounds like a household cleaner to me.  Democrat Jeanette Jamieson introduced an alternative gay marriage ban called  urlLink House Resolution 1470 , which I quite like because it sounds like a rave.  "(James Brown is dead!")  The difference is that she wants to tack on the word "adultery" so it's not just the gays that are a threat to the traditional marriage.  This is quite humerous when you consider the number of Republican representatives who were name checked for cheating on their wives and trying to pass a bill to protect marriage.  The loudest objections came from the representative who most recently fathered an illegitimate child with a former intern.  (Did someone say Bill Clinton?)  When questioned about such a hypocritical stance, the representative told the reporter she was stupid and that he didn't have to answer these questions.  It will be interested to see how this pans out in Georgia considering that the constitional amendment proposed by Bush seems to be losing popularity and civil unions are gaining support.  Still, the Christian Coalition is doing an excellent job lobbying for SR 595 at the Georgia Capitol.  They have at least 15-20 lobbyists a day expressing their support for the gay marriage ban to their legistlators.  The Georgia Equality Project has a couple of people who show up every few weeks.  My friend summed up the whole situation nicely:  "If only we had a few democrats who would stand up and remind folks that there are people without jobs, kids who can't spell and families with no medical care.  Let's focus on the issues that really matter."  Amen!

       PRINCESS HAD A BAD DAY   All was not well in the kingdom today.  Buddy, my cat, who I affectionately refer to as "Princess" because she acts like one, had a bad day today.  It started when I was working at the comptuer this morning and I hear this strange sound like an ardvark being strangled with a hackeysack.  (Don't ask how I know that!)  It stopped and I couldn't quite place it.  I went on working.  Then I hear it again.  So I get up from my desk to take a sticky B. around the house to figure out what it was all about.  I walk into the living room just in time to see Buddy projectile vomit onto the floor.  She had already thrown up once a few feet away and evidently her bowels had given out as well.  I walked over and checked her out.  She looked up at me with such a sad face.  She seemed to be saying, "I'm sorry Daddy."  I picked her up and took her into my bedroom where her little cat bed is.  I put her in the cat bed and petted her until she closed her eyes and went to sleep.  I walked into the living room and began cleaning.  Then I hear the sound again.  By the time I got back to my bedroom, she was emitting output from both ends again.  By this time the smell was so horrible, I had to open the windows and doors.  She looked up at me again and seemed to say, "Daddy, make it stop."  At this point, I began humming Tubular Bells from The Excoricist and cleaned up the bedroom.  Buddy hopped up onto my bed and I put my lap duvet on top of it.  It's her favorite thing to lay on.  She climbed on top of it, assumed the Cheerio position and went to sleep.  She was pretty listless the rest of the afternoon.  I went to my meeting and training class.  Our lender was taking our office to dinner tonight at the Old Vinings Inn.  During my training class, it occurred to me how much liquid Buddy had lost this morning.  The last time she got half as sick as that, she ended up in the vet's office over night.  I told my co-workers to go on and I went home to check on her.  When I walked in, she looked up from the duvet and I swear that she had smiled.  She had been sick twice more while I was gone. I put her in front of her water bowl to see if she would drink some, but she didn't really drink much.  She ended up staying close to me all evening as I worked.  I noticed that she began perking up as the evening progressed and asked what was for dinner when I went to fix a pita sandwich about nine o'clock.  I advised that people food might be too much for her delicate constitution right now.  She wasn't buying it so I gave her a tiny bit of turkey.  She then drank a lot of water.  She's kept it down and seems to have returned to her royal self.  I used to make fun of people that treated their pets like children.  What happened?  Still, it's not as bizarre as Hector's python, Fluffy.

       MY BEWITCHED THEORY   When I was small and we lived in the house on Bellaire Drive in Waco, Texas, my mother used to keep our photographs in a chest of drawers.  It was a middle drawer and I would have to open one of the lower drawers to use as a stepping stool to reach the drawer with the photographs.  I can still smell the cedar smell of that drawer filling my nostrils even after thirty years.  I remember that the paper envelopes the photographs were in had small thumbnails of Christmas scenes on the flap and the Fox Foto logo.  My sister and I would pull them out and climb on my parents full-size bed and we would explore our origins.  Baby pictures of us seemed like eons ago although it had only been four years for me and seven for my sister.  My mother would come in and find us.  Instead of getting mad, she would sit down with us and tell us stories about the pictures.  One of my favorites was about how I had cut my hand on a mustard jar while my mother was talking to my grandmother.  My grandmother didn't even say goodbye.  She ran out the door with the receiver dangling from the telephone, picked up my mother and I and rushed us to the emergency room.  There was also an 8x10 of my mother in a metal frame that was from her high school prom.  She had shoulder length hair and was wearing a rhinestone tiara.  I thought my mother looked so pretty with long hair and I told her she should let it grow again.  She opened the closet door and took out her tiara.  She put it on her head, mugged it up and began dancing around the room.  My mother is just a drag queen born in a straight woman's body.  Many of the pictures we looked at were in black and white.  I didn't understand why some pictures were in black and white and some were in color.  I knew we had a black and white television in the den and a color television in the living room.  I knew that the movies used to be in black and white, but most everything at that time was in color now.  Most of the pictures in black and white showed people with the same hair styles and fashions as the first season of  Bewitched , which was filmed in black and white.  The second season, it was filmed in color.  My theory was that the whole world was in black and white until the second season of  Bewitched .  I believed that for the longest time.  I even had other kids believing it and telling other kids about it.  Another story my mother told me, which I didn't understand at the time, was about my grandfather coming to see me after I was born.  He took one look at me and shook his head.  "They ruined him," he said and walked away.  I just figured out that my grandfather wasn't circumcized.

       THE HP 3330 ALL-IN-ONE IS FOR ME   So I went into Staples to purchase one of those all-in-one unites that include the printer, scanner, copier and fax.  I already have a scanner and printer, but I need a copier and scanner that can really hold up for my home office.  I found one that looked good, but then a sales clerk showed me another.  It was taller than I had wanted, but it's a laser printer with all the functions that I needed.  It will make about 2500 more copies with one toner cartridge than the ink jet will with one ink cartridge.  Now it's a $700 printer on sale for $500 with a $100 rebate.  I was sold.  Unfortunately, so was Staples.  They were sold out and the item is discontinued with them.  You cannot even order it from their Web site.  Sigh... at least I know what I want now.  Something strange happened during my conversation with Mr. Staples.  I found him attractive.  I mean he wasn't a super model type, but he had a pleasing face and build and was just a genuinely nice guy.  If I had been single, I definitely could have done some damage to him.  No, that's not true.  I thought he was an attractive guy, but that's about it.  Now, since I'm not single, I immediately started thinking of single friends that I could match him up with before really taking a good reading that it would not matter to Mr. Staples because he likes the fairer sex.    I don't normally find myself attracted to other people.  I notice who's attractive, but it's more like categorizing bugs on pins in an insect collection.  Don't get me wrong!  I'm not saying that there was any stirring down below either.  I just noticed that he was attractive and very helpful.  I thought he was a nice guy.  So is my partner and sometimes I think we find ourselves attracted to others that reflect back the qualities we admire in our partners and even ourselves.  If you do an inventory of your friends, I'll bet you find you surround yourself with people who at least share some of the same values or qualities that you do.  All in all, I guess this experience is somehow influenced by a short story I'm working on.  I'm one of those closet romantics.   I don't want people to know that I am the male Barbara Cartland writing about my raven-haired hero.  Suddnely, the story of Bill, the office supply salesman and Todd, the jaded go-go boy starts revealing itself at the keyboard as their eyes lock while reaching for the same package of yellow highlighters.  Magic!

       EXPERIENCE SOUPER JENNY   My first day working from home as an independent originator went very well.  It's sort of a weird feeling adjusting from the old mentality to the new mentality.  I kept finding myself wanting to reach out in many different directions.  There were people to call, letters to write, systems to be set up, dishes to wash, household projects that need to be done, etc.  I sorted it out last night and I feel I have a better hold on that.  I am very disciplined person and I mean that both with the cat of nine tails and without.  At noon, Joan (Conversations With A Woman) picked me up and we went to lunch at Souper Jenny where our friend Merridith works.  It's a neat little place in Buckhead where they offer a small menu of soups, salads and sandwiches.  We had the chicken tortilla soup and it was so good.  It was very filling.  The entire staff is all struggling actors.  In fact, Merrideth said that some guy who used to be on Party Of Five works with her, but I can't tell you his name. I watch very little TV and none when that show was on.  She says that he is great guy.  I think his partner lives here and that's why he moved here.  I may just be channeling this so don't take any of this for Gospel truth.  The more shocking bit for me was recognizing the guy dishing the soup out from a play I saw at the Art Farm a year or so ago.  I't s not every day that you ask someone, "Weren't you the Sumerian guard in 'Vampire Lesbians Of Sodom?'"  Sure enough, he was.  He mentioned something about a loin cloth.  I don't remember that part.  He seems like a nice kid.  He reminds me of Taye Diggs, I think. My ability to remember faces and names still astounds me at times except when I forget.

       A GREAT IDEA FOR A CHILDREN'S BOOK   I was speaking with a friend the other day about questions that we hate to be asked.  She mentioned that as a lesbian, she hates to be asked, "So... what do you do in bed?" We pondered this for a moment.  True, it's rude to ask someone about the intimate details of their sex life, but why are people in general so perplexed by lesbian sex?  Personally, I think it's because there is no outdoor plumbing.  That's right.  You heard it here first.  The American public believes that sex is only sex when there is some sort of insertion involved.  Heterosexual intercourse involves the insertion of the penis into the vagina in order to fertilize the ovum.  Oral sex performed by a man or woman on a man involves the insertion of the penis into the mouth.  Gay sex generally refers to anal sex between two men.  One man will insert his penis into the other man's anus, preferably with a condom coating.  Lesbian sex seems to lack something in the minds of the unaware.  They figure that one woman has no penis to insert into the other woman's vagina.  (Turkey basters do not count.)  Oral sex between two women does not involve a penis or penetration.  Now, I know that some of you will be quick to note that some lesbian sex does involve penetration by a finger, a vibrator or a faux penis, but this is not what normally comes to mind for the general public.  In fact, if you know that, you're probably a lesbian.  It occurred to me that what most people need is an education about what lesbians do.  I thought to myself what is the best way to demonstrate the zen simplicity of lesbian sex than with a pop-up book.  Yes, cunninglingus will be coming at ya in 3D!  No position or sexual technique will be left out in order to show Mr. & Mrs. America what our Saphic Sisters do for fun. It also makes a great Father's Day gift.  Now, what to call it?

      AN YTHING IS POSSIBLE   As some of you may know, last week I struggled with continuing to work writh my business partner, Robert, or to begin originating loans on my own.  We had been working together as a team since last September and it was beneficial to both of us.  However, some things had changed and I realized that we had outgrown the need to work together.   I've been taking a class at church called The Quest For Wholeness and since I have been taking that class lots of unusual things have been happening.  I've thought of someone out of the blue and then run into them on the other side of town.  That happend three times in three consecutive days.  The loan that almost died was resurrected.  Then out of the blue, I just have this feeling that I should work alone.  It was a scary feeling.  It's much more comfortable to have things remain the same, but the feeling was very deep.  I took a chance and voiced my feelings to Robert on Friday.  He took the news well and we agreed to process the situation over the weekend.  I was feeling somewhat ambivalent.  I really had no solutions to divy up our prospects and realtor partners.  However, today he presented some options to me that divided up our resources very fairly.  In fact, I'm still surprised.  We told our boss, Carol Lynn, and she said she thought it was great that we were moving on.  All of a sudden, new resources started coming out of the woodwork like magic.  Phone calls came out of nowhere.  I came home early to do an inventory of my neighborhood regarding homes for sale.  Carol Lynn called me on my way home to tell me that she knew I'm going to be very successful on my own and she will be there for me to help me in any way that she can.  I work for a great company.  I took an inventory of my neighborhood and in just the surrounding eight to twelve blocks there are about ten houses for sale.  Surely, I can get one or two realtors to work with me.  Finally, I received an e-mail tonight from one of the other realtors that I have been working with and he is sending some more clients my way.   I'm in awe.  Whenever I follow my intution, even when it doesn't make any sense, everything always falls into place like magic.  Tomorrow I'm going out to buy a 4-in-1 printer/scanner/copier/fax.  I'm planning to work mostly from home now so I can be the neighborhood mortgage person.  It's funny, because now everything is falling into place as I imagined it almost 12 months ago.

       CLEANING OUT YOUR MEDICINE CABINET   As I was grooming this morning after I stepped out of the shower, I realized that I'm still using some pomade that I don't really care for.  It doesn't smell like a delicious tropical smoothie like the molding creme I used last summer.  So I'm standing there naked peering into this small brown container trying to figure out what this is all about.  It occurs to me that there are several things in my medicine cabinet that I'm not crazy about. I'm still using some Halston Z-14 that someone gave 2F's years ago because it needs to be used up.  I don't want to smell like Z-14 or Z-28.  So I ask myself why I'm using these things and I listen.  I hear a voice say that I can't just throw them away.  That's wasteful.  Think about all the starving children in third world countries who don't have any hair care products.  I pitched in the trash.  It was almost gone anyway.

       I DON'T WANNA GO TO WORK TODAY   It's another beautiful day today.  I had my nose pressed against the glass as if I were small child delighting in the proof of snow and no school today, but it's actually quite sunny, warm, albeit a bit windy and the magnolia trees have opened their petals up to greet the world.  I don't think I need to go into an office today even if it is filled with "fabulous women."  I wondered if perhaps it had something to do with the fact that I told Robert that I wanted to work separately moving forward and we really haven't come up with much of a solution to do that considering that we have several clients and realtor partners that we have established relationships together.  I don't think it has anything to do with that.  I think I had a great relaxing day yesterday and I'd like to stay home and tackle my lists of projects  I'd like to grab my inline skates and head to Piedmont Park and skate along with Bananarama, the B-52's or Blondie today.

       IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD   We hand another gorgeous day in Atlanta.  I went to the early church service and my class so that I could run a few errands and get home early and start on my many projects that need to be completed.  I put the top down, turned up Belinda Carlisle and ran my errands.  I arrived home, changed into my running shorts, made a healthy pita sanwhich and folded the remaining laundry.  Afterwards, I put Dannii Minogue's Neon Nights album into my CD player and hit the streets.  I jogged down to Grant Park and begin to do my loop around the park.  It was a windy day so I decided to do my clockwise circuit so as to avoid running up the steep hill, which is down hill from the Elephant pen.  A Japanese family stopped me to ask for directions to Little Five Points.  I gave them directions to the bus stop for MARTA.  It was a nice run.  The sun was out.  People were out.  Dogs were out.  There was so much to look at as Dannii advised me to put the needle on it.  Her songs really help you keep a rhythm as you run.  After I made the loop, I found the Japanese family at the bus stop. I told them the bus should be along shortly.  They told me they were in town visiting from Dallas.  They laughed when I told them that I am originally from Dallas.  It's a small world.  This evening, I looked out the window from the master bedroom upstairs.  I could see the downtown skyline of Atlanta to my right.  To my left, I saw waves of clouds crashing against an invisible shore.  They were purple, red, orange and pink.  I just sat there a while feeling the breeze blow across my face as I watched the clouds over the rooftops of all the houses in my neighborhood.

       CHEESEY 80's FLASHBACK   A friend recently sent me a surprise in the mail.  It was a DVD of  Kylie Minogue On The Go in Japan .  I must admit that my left eyebrown arched in interest as I looked at the cheesey picture of our girl, Kylie, on the front.  I made a point to watch it some time this weekend.    This afternoon I went upstairs to iron as I watched DVD's.  I decided it was a golden opportunity to watch the DVD my friend sent me so I put it in.  I think it came from France or Portugal because nothing was in English on the box and it had Japanese subtitles displayed on the TV.  Wow!  It's amazing how much I had forgotten about 1989.  In hindsight, I am thankful that I forgot what I did.  Her male backup dancers were wearing bicycle shorts and big black shoes with chunky souls.  They had big hair that was jacked up to Jesus and the choerography made my high school drill team look like Solid Gold Dancers.  Kylie had big permed hair and wore a little sequined short and halter set with tap shoes.  She looked like she was about to audition for Dames At Sea.  It was not a good look.  If I noticed, it's not a good look.  The whole thing was very cheesey.  Kylie was very green.  She had just huge success around the world with her first album and had just released a second album.  It also took place during her cheesey PWL period.  She was such a far cry from the sophisticated and confident performer of today.  The thing that impressed me the most was the huge laptop that she lugged around.  It was HUGE.  It was big enough to attack Godzilla.  Anyway, it was interesting to watch, but I like the Kylie of today much better.  Plus, it brought up the fact that somewhere there is a picture of me in long denim shorts, a white T-shirt, a leopard skin vest, black fedora and big black shoes with chunky souls.  I must find this picture and destroy it.  If I can do that, then that moment in time never happened.

       ODE TO MY DAD   Yesterday was my father' birthday.  He turned 61.  It's so hard to believe that my dad could be 61.  Of course, now that I'm 36, I don't feel that 61 is quite that old anymore.  I have a good relationship with my father and I'm proud of that.  Whenever I talk to my father, I always tell him that I love him before I hang up.  I don't have any unfinished business or anything left unsaid.  If anything happened to either one of us, I don't think we would greive any unspoken words or feelings.  I had a very unconventioal childhood.  My father has always done body work on cars to make extra money and as a hobby.  He does beautiful work and takes great care and pride in what he does.  Whenever he picked me up after school, I was never certain what he would arrive in. My favorite to date was the wrecker.  It also seemed to impress my classmates the most.  When my mother and older sister would go camping with girl scouts on weekends, my father would take me to a little convenience store near our home in Waco, Texas.  We called it "The Little Store."  He would let me buy a bag of candy and some comic books.  During one of those times, my father cut a hole in a refrigerator box and made a rocket ship for me.  I would sit inside and eat candy and read comic books.  I can even see those comic books now.  One was  Detective Comics  featuring Batman and the other was something like grisley tales and a woman was tied to stakes in the ground and a man through a gilla monster at her.  That particular evening, we went to McDonalds and I had one of those neopolitan ice cream cones they used to sell with the clear plastic bubble on top.  We came home and laid on the cound togther to watch a TV special on UFO's that I had been looking forward to all week and I promply fell asleep.  I used to think my father could fix anything.  One day I discovered that he could not fix a cheap Spiderman helicopter that I bought at K-Mart.  It was sobering, but then I just claimed that he could fix anything... except cheap plastic Spiderman helicopters from K-Mart.  In adolesence, my relationship was strained with my father.  I'm sure puberty had something to do with it and he was tougher on me because I was the boy.  My senior year in high school, I had one of the leads in the musical and I sang a solo in front of the whole orchestra.  After the show, my father was so proud that he told my sister that I should go audition at Six Flags Over Texas.  I can remember the first time I stood up to my father as an adult.  I had joined the Bally's on Turtle Creek in Dallas and my father told me that I had just wasted my money.  I said, "You know, if you don't have anything supportive to say to me, I wish that you would just keep it to yourself."  I heard my father audiblely gasp on the other end of the phone and I thought that he might have swallowed his tongue.  My mother soon came on the line and asked, "What did you say to your father?  His face turned purple and he walked outside."  After that, my father has only ever been supportive of me.  My favorite memory of my father was toward the end of the time that I lived with my first roommate, Chris.  We had a horrible fight and I knew that I needed to move out.  I can't remember if my dad called me or if I called him.  I was upset, but not crying or anything.  I was mainly frustrated.  My father told me that he would be willing to drive all the way over from Fort Worth to meet me and talk to me if I wanted him to.  I was stunned.  I had never elaborated on the extent of my relationship with Chris and my father saying this was his way of saying that he knew the truth, he still loved me and he was going to be there for me.  I thanked him for the offer, but said I would be okay.  That in itself gave me the strength to go ahead and tell Chris I was leaving when the lease was up.  Every once in a while when I'm driving my car, I look down at my hands and wonder if they look like my dad's hands when he was my age.  I know this sounds a bit strange, but I was around ten when my dad was my age.  That's an age when kids start paying attention to the details around them.  My father has big hands with big, thick fingers.  My hands are long with slender fingers.  (My grandmother said that I had the hands of a surgeon.)  I don't know what the feeling is all about.  I look at my hands and try to figure out if my hands look 30ish and try to remember what my dad's hands looked like when he was 30ish.  Come to think of it, I can remember being 12 or 13 and looking at my father's hands and wondering what my hands would look like at his age.  It's not an age thing with me.  I like growing older.  I'm in better shape now,  mentally, physcially, emotionally and spiritually, than I was in my teens or 20's.  I guess it's that I'm looking for some physical link to prove that I am my father's son.  I want there to be a connection.  I want to belong to him.  I want us to have a visible, genetic bridge that connects in a way that guns, Kylie Minogue, cars and Bananarama cannot.  In closing, I'd just like to say that I love my dad.  In fact, I really like him and he really likes me.  Nothing else really matters.

       INFAMOUS GO-GO'S VIDEO   I found the infamous Go-Go's video that was was made in an Atlanta hotel room in the mid 80's.  What is it with Atlanta hotel rooms?  Remember Rob Lowe during the Democratic Convention?  He is a good friend of the Go-Go's and was in the Turn To You video.  Hmmm....  Here is the description of the video that's on  urlLink eBay :   This is the infamous “underground” video featuring the 1980’s all-girl band. It was apparently shot by a roadie. The video equipment is pretty primitive compared to today’s standards. The band members appear to be drunk/stoned. Belinda Carlisle philosophizes about her promiscuity and the wonderfulness of self-induced fun. The cameraman seems to know exactly what he was doing, as he constantly tries to get the girls to say or do sexual things. At one point, the girls pull down the pants of a passed-out roadie and cover him in shaving creme. Needless to say, this poor guy was toyed with in other ways as well. This is an interesting video, and well worth a look. Tape comes in a plain white box. Please ask questions before bidding. Add 3.00 for shipping and handling, or 7.00 for overseas.    Wouldn't a plan brown box be more appropriate?  I love eBay!

       THE WISDOM OF BELINDA CARLISLE   I occasionally wonder what's up with certain celebrities and google them to find out what's new with them.  This afternoon, I decided to play the first Belinda Carlisle album as I was tooling around Atlanta in the Miata while running errands.  I had the top down and my Ray Bans on and I looked straight ouf of the Mad About You video.  That was from May of 1986 as I was graduating from high school.  So I came across  urlLink Belinda-Carlisle.com  and it had this quotes section.  I thought I would share with you some of the more profound axioms I found there.   "Our dog Harriet once jumped all over Nancy Raegan and tore her stockings. Morgan [her husband] was so embarassed, but I thought it was pretty funny."  "I never really liked the Pet Shop Boys."  "I have PMT today. I feel bloated and fat."  "Life's too short to be a Go-Go for twenty years."  "I was too lazy to drum, so I thought I might as well sing."   "A lot of people seem to have a stick up their butts about me."  "I've always wanted to own a shop."   "My favourite songs are usually the ones that weren't big hits."  "Live life for today, not tomorrow."  "There's still some punk in me. "  "Changing your style to whatever's fashionable is not me. "  "The idea of eating a frog is just disgusting to me. I have eaten snails before, when I was younger. The butter and the garlic are nice, but the snail is like a piece of rubber. "  "At one time I had 32 people after me that were considered dangerous. There was one guy who lived half an hour away from me who wanted to kill my husband because I belonged to him. And I had one guy who came to my show in Reno, Nevada, with a gun - and they wanted me to go onstage wearing a bulletproof vest so they could capture him! I was like, 'No way! Why should I live my life like this? It's f--ed!'.""  "Sometimes, friends are better on the phone. "

       CUSS AND DISCUSS   Ever notice how some people can sprinkle their every day conversation with obscenities and it sounds so natural and unoffensive where as some people can say something as mild as goodness gracious and it comes off sounding gruff?  Well, I have.  I was reading an e-mail from Natalie at Pickle Juice this evening and realized that her writing has that conversational, stream-of-consciousness style, it is littered with profanity, but it sounds good.  I can't do that anymore.  I just sound like a drunk sailor.  Eleven years ago, I worked in the Promotions Department of Pepsico Food Systems (PFS) in Dallas.  PFS provided all the food for KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  I worked with a girl named Ellen.  She had gone to Ursula Academy with at least one of the Dixie Chicks and knew the male model from the first Calvin Klein underwear billboard.  She loved Garth Brooks and going out with her friend, Laurel to talk about their loser boyfriends.  On these special occasions, Ellen would leave the office and say, "I'm off to cuss and discuss with Laurel.  I'll see you tomorrow."  I wonder what Ellen is doing now?  In a bizarre turn of events, a few months later I began receiving obscene phone calls in the middle of the night.  Naturally, I thought it was one of my friends playing a joke on me so I just gave it right back.  So the guy starts calling every night and I gradually realize that I didn't know him, but he knew who I was.  He always asked me to come over to his house for sex.  Doesn't that sound odd?  It sounds sort of like you baked a lemon tort and you are inviting me over some tea and dessert.  Anyway, after a few days, I went to the library and tracked the telephone number down to a name.  It was Ellen's older brother.  That evening he called again and I busted him.  I never heard from him again.

       WHERE THE "F" IS MY OTHER "F"?   Okay, okay, okay....  Many of you have been asking me why there is only one "F" in my name.  I will tell you the answer.  About twelve years ago I had the equivalent of a nervous breakdown.  I was in a bad space and in a bad relationship at the time.  After some reading and soul-searching, I realized that most of my emotional issues stemmed from holding on to too many things that I no longer needed.  I went through my belongings and began to throw out old clothes and other items that I no longer used.  In the process, I discovered that I was also slowly releasing a lot of mental baggage at the same time.  One afternoon while paying bills, I signed a check.  It suddenly dawned on me that when I pronounced my name, there was only one "F" sound even though there were two "F's" in my name.  At that point in time, I quit signing my name with two "F's" as a reminder to myself to never hold onto anything that I no longer needed.  So far, it's worked and people seldom forget my name.

       DID JESUS GET ZITS?   The pastor from  urlLink Landover Baptist Church  explains it all for us.   "Dear Pastor,   I am a freshman student at Landover Baptist Christian Academy.  I am teased all the time by the other kids because I have very bad pimples.  They call me "pizza face" and say that I've got acne because I'm a sinner.  My question is, did Jesus ever get zits, and if so, is that why people were so mean to him?   Sincerely,   - Jimmy     Dear Jimmy,    Thank you for your thoughtful inquiry, which provides a wonderful opportunity to address important, yet often-overlooked historical trivia about our Savior.  Bible accounts of the life of our Personal Savior are very much like those of our National Savior, George W. Bush – there are about twenty years there that are totally unaccounted for!  For our President, it is the awkward pre-adult adolescence of his 20s and 30s that have been thoughtfully expunged.  With the Lord Jesus, the missing biography is from the time he was Catholic priest bait until several years after he sprouted short, pointy hairs around the Holy genitalia of glorification. Fortunately, one of the biggest selling points about being a conservative Christian is that a silence in the Bible is an invitation by God to start making things up!  So, I am sure that if the Bible were more forthcoming about Jesus' "lost years," it would tell us that before Jesus learned to use white magic to make rotting dead bodies talk and dance for the amusement of crowds, that  He, Himself was positively smothered in festering whiteheads throughout his puber-teens.  And yes, it partly was for this reason that our Lord was an outcast in His day - not unlike a lazy-eyed A/V club four-eyed leper assigned a homeroom seat smack dab in the middle of a clique of top-tier hard-bodied populars.      Yet Jimmy, you should know that later in life, Jesus turned His dermatological affliction into a strength - using His cystic pustules as a mighty shield with which He repelled the cheap, open-legged Jewesses who stalked Him tirelessly, feverishly intent on running their greedy fingers through His long, Judean-mullet, which was luxuriously conditioned by scores of folks' body oil, as the Lord used his thick, absorbent mane to towel-off the feet of strangers he washed.  And that is why today, Jesus and His daddy reserve the gift of acne specifically for the chosen - as a means to help safeguard purity.  So to you I say, "Rejoice Jimmy, and revel in thy pimply good fortune!"     Revelation tells us that Jesus' hair is like wool and that his skin is bronze.  Before you become too alarmed by this description, remember that the Lord came to Earth to suffer for our sins – and what better way can one suffer than to be mistaken for one of those Negro-type people?  The point I am getting at is that Jesus was created in the image of someone in the Middle East.  In other words, he must have been pretty (and pardon the French here) "damned ugly!." So, what difference is a colony of pimples going to make?     Now, as regards the term "pizza face" - I must inform you that the mere utterance of a reference to Catholic cuisine is an insult to the entire student body of Landover Academy.  It is a well-known fact that Mary Worshiping priests take time away from their catamites long enough to consecrate pizza pies, allowing deranged Catholics to engorge themselves on the flesh of our Savior by the slice. For the record, the hallowed halls of our fully self-accredited institution have never been sullied by the likes of these slick Italians.  So the next time you're accosted with that slur, sternly inform your tormenters that Pastor himself insists that henceforth, they address you with exclusively American food metaphors, such as "peach cobbler face" or "creamed corn face."     I trust this addresses your question, and your problem is now solved.       Yours in Christ,     - Pastor"

       THE NAKED TRUTH   On Tuesday evening, I went to my writer's group meeting at a local book store.  I would occasionally look up at a shelf that showcased a book called something like Naked Places To Go.  I was fascinated by this book because it appeared from the distance to have a picture of a naked man wrock climbiing up a stony precipice.  My first thought was, "Look out below!"  After the meeting, I breezed over to this shelf and picked up the book.  I shivered as I looked at the cover.  The man appeared to be wearing no protective gear.  My heart went out to his testicles.  I opened the book and flipped through the pages.  It appeared to be more advertisements than anything else.  There are so many places that you visit naked in the continental U.S.  Most pictures seemed to have men relaxing in the buff while wearing cowboy hats.  while chewing on a piece of straw.  Swimming pools, hot tubs and other water presentation were heavily featured.  I was hoping to find a picture of some naked guys playing a vigorous game of volleyball, but no such luck.  It just seems to be a game that you should play at a clothing optional facility.  "Spike it, Chuck!"  What impressed me most about the book was the variety of men and body types that were present in the book.  Not everyone was a Playgirl centerfold and it was great.  Some men were lean and hairless and some were chubby and furry.  What does this say?  I think it says that for many men who travel to these places, nudity is not so much about sex, but feeling good about yourself.  In 1993 I met Donald while volunteering at the aids resource center in Dallas.  My best friend, Kent, had been diagnosed wtih full-blown aids in January.  Feeling helpless, I figured the least I could do would be to volunteer.  I was living with Chris at the time and things had been heading south for some time.  I had finally realized that we were dependent upon one another emotionally, but we needed to separate to make new friends and live our lives without each other for a while.  Donald offered to let me move in with him.  I thought this would be great.  We had a great time together.  We laughed a lot.  We enjoyed clubbing and CD shopping.  Little did I know what was in store.  After I moved in, I discoverd that Donald was a epidermis-loving nudist.  I discovered this one day when I came home from work and found him wearing nothing but headphones in the living room while ironing in the nude.  I took note and went on with my life.  I have spent a lot of my life in locker rooms so I just thought of it as an extension in those terms and spent a great deal of my time away from home or in my bedroom.  One evening I heard a yelp, and ran into the living room.  Donald had dropped something and bent over the ironing board to retrieve it.  Unfortunately, he had forgotten about the iron.  I looked at the little black charred steeple shape on his stomach and grabbed some aloe vera.  We both laughed.  Whenever I would return to the apartment with friends, I would usually announce in a loud voice, "Donald, I'm home and I have some friends with me."  If I heard a flutter of pages, I knew that he was reclining on the sofa reading hardback biographies for former first ladies in the all together.  This was his second passion.  One evening, Donald asked if I would do a favor for him.  I asked what I could do.  He told me that he wanted to attend a meeting of a local male naturist group, but didn't want to go alone.  Would I go with him?  I have nothing against nudity.  It makes bathing so much easier. I can understand how people can delight in going to the beach and enjoying the feel of the wind on their bare skin.  Everyone should know the exhileration of skinny dipping at least once, but I just never had the urge to strip down and prance around naked at home.  Growing up, we had a lot of vinyl furniture and on a hot summer day, you never knew when you might have to jump up quickly.  This was not conducive to being naked.  Not knowing what I was getting myself into, I agreed to go with him.  He told me to bring a towel.  The next evening, Donald and I drove to an apartment community in the Hurst/Euless/Bedford area. As we drove through the complex looking for the street number, I couldn't help but wonder if everyone was naked right now in their own individual apartments.  They were cooking in the buff.  They were vacuuming in raw.  They were aerobicizing au naturale.  Eventually, we parked.  With towels in hand, we knocked the door.  The door opened a crack and an eyeball asked if it could help us.  We said we were here for the meeting.  The eyeball told us to hold on.  As he undid the chain, I couldn't help but think this must have been what it was like to go to a speakeasy during prohibiltion.  As we walked in, our host closed the door and revealed himself in all of his glory.  It was strange because I didn't really know where to look.  I mean, I didn't look at his crotch, but his elbows were naked and his chest was naked and his knees were naked and I just felt like I was staring.  He told us we could disrobe in the bedroom.  I think Donald must have jumped out of his clothes faster than a tear-away G-string and he was off like a flash into the living room.  I, on the other hand, took a deep breath and removed my underwear.  I'm not ashamed of my body, but there is nothing like going to your first nudist meeting to make you feel self-conscious.  What if I developed one of those inexplicable woodies?  I took another deep breath and walked into the living room.  The men were mostly 35+ and in a variety of shapes and sizes.  I put my towel down in the nearest opening in the circle.  I sat between a doctor and an attorney.  There was a little meeting and then we just sort of had an open discussion.  It was amazing.  I very quickly forgot that I was naked.  As the doctor to my left explained, all clothing is just drag.  It can be business drag, construction drag, preppie drag, etc.  Clothing indicates status and separates us from our oneness with other people.  However, when you're nude, there is nothing to separate you.  You're just like everyone else.  Okay, okay, some will say not all men are created equal, but that's if you are looking for a one-night stand.  These men were approaching it from a higher place.  It was almost tribal... except without the drums.    I never went back to another meeting, but Donald was soon very involved and I spent more time in the living room.  All in all, I was very pleased that I went.  I learned a lot that evening.  Whenever I feel separated from another man, or woman, I just simply imagine us sitting there naked together having a pleasant chat.  It works every time.

       LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDA THING   I had lunch with my friend, Karen, today.  She is the first friend I met when I moved to Atlanta.  I thought she was nice, but I kept thinking she just talked way too much about how perfect her marriage was.  Eventually, she realized that she no longer wanted to be married and they parted amicably.  I like her ex-husband.  What happened you ask?  She found herself and decided to start pleasing herself instead of living her life for everyone else.  "You get on wit your bad self, Miss K.!"  Over the next five or six years, Karen dated many "growing experiences."  However, she seems to have found Mr. Right.  Her new beau, Beau, has a car, a job and treats her well.  Sing Hallelujah!  She says that he is very sweet.  You should have seen her today.  There was literally a twinkle in her eye, her skin glowed, she was wearing a top with a peek-a-boo diamond revealing skin.   "What's up with your breasts?" I asked.  "What do you mean?" She looked down at he boobage as if they just magically appeared.  "Well... you have them.  I mean, they are just all round and inflated and breasty-looking.  If I didn't know better, I'd swear your lactating."  "I'm not pregnant!"  "I know, but it's like you have fallen in love and your bosom has blossomed."  "Thanks, I think."  "Hey, I would never diss your cleavage.  I'm thrilled for you, Beau and your boobs.  Come to think of it, Beau is probably thrilled  for your boobs too."   I am so happy for her. She deserves happiness.  Now, I have to go to dinner with them so I can give my blessing.  He likes chocolate chip cookies so things are looking good.

       MY EVENING ALONE WITH CHOCOLATE-COVERED STRAWBERRIES   Last night, I finished up working from home about eight o'clock.  In an unusual chain of events, I'm sure the sun and the planets were aligned just right, I actually turned on the teleivsion and watched... The Golden Girls.  It was two episodes back-to-back.  I caught the tail end of Blanche deciding to have cosmetic surgery and Dorothy inviting a man to the house for dinner only to find out he was a priest.  Yeah, it's formulatic television, but every once in a while they say one jokes that makes blow milk out your nostril holes that makes it all worthwhile.    Afterwards, I read a magazine and then moseyd into the kitchen for something sweet.  I had already had a piece of fruit today, but noticed that the strawberries were about to leave this mortal coil.  I decided to use some spare baking chocolate to make chocolate-covered strawberries.  I threw a square in a bowl and microwaved it while I washed and dried the strawberries.  I put some wax paper on the counter.  I removed the bowl from the microwave and then stirred the chocolate.  I picked up a big ol' strawberry and plunged it into the chocolate, slowly spinning it around to generously coat the berry surface completely.  Then I placed it on the wax paper to set.  I repeated this process with several other strawberries of various sizes and body types.  Then I ate them.  Oh, they were good.  They are one of life's simple pleasures.  I can say that I honestly lost myself in the moment as I focused on the combination of the chocolate and strawberry coming together to tease my taste buds.  At one point, I actually caught my reflection in the glass of the kitchen cabinets, running my fingers seductively through my hair with my eyes half-closed.  I stopped.  This seemed unnatural and then I closed my eyes and enjoyed myself some more.  Then I washed the dishes and returned to my magazine.  A friend called a few minutes later and I told him about the strawberries.  I told him just how powerful the experience had been.     "Did you smear chocolate on your nipples?" He asked.  "  No," I replied.  "I just ate them... and enjoyed them."    "Sometimes I like to rub hot chocolate all over my nipples and then-"   "I have to go," I interrupted.  "The cat's playing with the stove again."

       A RANDOM THOUGHT ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE   Whenever I rush out of the house and forget to brush my teeth, I always feel like I can relate to homeless people better.  You know one thing I've always wondered about?  If they are homeless and have no money, where do they get the marker to write on their cardboard sign?  I think there may be a market for homeless person kits.  I'll include a medium-sized piece of cardboard with water-proof coating, a broad magic marker, a soile tobogan and mittens with the fingers cut out, an emtpy two-litter soft drink bottel with the top cut off and some starter change.

       ODE TO ALBERT   One of the joys of living in a historic neighborhood in Atlanta, is being able to walk a few blocks to CVS and buy a birthday card for your dad.  It has been beautiful in Atlanta lately.  The skies have been blue and we've had "baby bear" weather; it's not cool and not too warm.  I've even been driving around topless!  Well, I mean I put the top down on the Miata.  I have not been putting my nipples to the wind.  Anyway, it was a beautiful night and I walked down to CVS.  There is a house with large bamboo in front of it that I like to walk through.  The street light above shines down on the bamboo around me and creates this reddish-yellow tunnel.  I passed the homeless people who always ask me for money outside of the drugstore.  My heart goes out to them, but if you give them money, you see them drinking with their buddies at the BP station up the street.  I perused the selection of greeting cards.  Typically, I find one that starts off saying something I like and then realize it's for a husband, a grand-daughter or a sympathy card.  I finally found one I liked and it's heavy too.  I got in line.  The CVS is notorious for being slow and is typically referred to as the "inconvenience store."  However, there is a man by the name of Albert who works there that I just love.  He is 40ish and originally from some country in Africa.  He has a very pleasant accent and is so enthusiastic about each person that shows up to buy chewing gum, pork rinds, eye shadow and latex condoms.  He always inspires me to go the next step when he waits on me.  So he scans my father's birthday card and I plop down my $4.27.  Albert leans forward and asks, "A small bag?"  His eyes are large and full of help. It reminds me of French cartoon.  I smile coyly and say, "No, thank you.  I'll just carry it."  Therefore, I'd like to raise my juice glass to Albet this morning and just say, "Thanks, dude, for making the inconcenience store convenient again."

       POEM FOR TODAY   Troy posted that it is post a poem day.  Being that I was once a prolific poet, I thought I would post a poem for your entertainment pleasure.   Looking Glass  Staring Unsure Into the Looking Glass My heart races Until I can see clearly In the crystal ball The reflection Of my fathers nose And my mothers smile In my own eyes An inexplicable connection That gives peace And a history Of where and whom I have been   Oh, what the heck.  Here's one more:   Rainy Day  I like a rainy day. A curtain of tears Surrounding me Leading me inward Turn off the radio And listen To the ambient lullaby Rock my conscious mind To Sleep And asking my subconscious To come out and play Working at my computer Its glow is Lincoln's firelight Candlelight of a love affair With myself I plunge my entire hands Into intimacy with myself And knead it Noting the consistency  Of my soul The texture of my personality Perhaps I will curl up With a soft blanket And firm pillow Close my eyes And run hand in hand  With my imagination Sometimes I press my cheek Against the cool glass Of my window And take in the drowning world With hungry eyes An idea comes to me My conscious mind In its slumber Is absent to dismiss My wish As ridiculous So I remove my clothes And stand in the doorway The cool breeze kissing my bare skin With sensual droplets of moisture. I run out into the backyard I comb my hair back with my fingers And let raindrops parachute onto my tongue I feel my feet squish into The grass Puddles And mud I sing a song In a language all of my own Rejoicing with all my might As I dance around and around In celebration of the rain I love a rainy day.

       LUNCH WITH KIKI   I had lunch with a friend the other day who now wants to be referred to as "Kiki."  I aim to please, so Kiki it is.  Kiki and his boyfriend have an open relationship.  They've been together a little longer than Jefffier has, but they have had an open relationship for quite a while.  Since I'm still working on a short story about open relationships, I questioned Kiki about it for some research.  The numbers were about as much as I expected.  He said that at least half of all gay couples have talked about and have guidelines for having sex outside the relationship.  It may be that it happens away from home and they agree not to talk about it.  They may only pick up a third partner occasionally.  It may be that they are allowed to "play" while out of town.  Whatever works for them is what they do.  I've always maintained that two people have to have a very solid relationship to make this arrangement work.  One person may want it more than the other and then jealousy rears its ugly head.  It's also sometimes used to draw attention away from problems within the relationship that neither side wants to address.  Then it simplys masks a slow death of the relationship until it withers away completely.  Finally, some people make it work very successfully for them.  Now, I have to clarify that Kiki first had his numbers up at 100%, but changed them when I qualified my question with "an arrangement between both parties that has been discussed with both parties."  He thinks all gay couples have strayed at one point or another.  "After all, we are only men."  I'm not sure I agree.  Yes, I know some couples who hit a rough patch and one person may have had a tryst in despair or frustration, but realized they wanted to work things out.  However, they did not have other sexual partners on a consistent basis.    Then Kiki tells me that if 2Fs wasn't so religious, he would probably want to have a three-way.  I told him his opinion was duly noted, but I don't agree.  Some of what Kiki terms religious is intrinsically who 2Fs is.  Plus, I've noticed that when some men come out later in life, say lay 30s or early 40s, they have already dated women and don't need to be the kid in the candy store.    What I find interesting about the conversation with Kiki is how certain he was of gay behavior and how his beliefs applied to every one.  Granted, in his mind love and sex are not mutually exclusive and he and his partner make their arrangement work successfully like many other men, but I think the number of gay men who aren't interested in open relationships might surprise him.  It made me think about my beliefs about a lot of different things and wonder just how objective I am.  I told 2Fs about the conversation.  He confirmed what I thought he would say.  Don't get me wrong.  I have asked him about this subject because I came out much earlier than he did and sowed my wild oates so to speak, but he never did.  I wondered if he needed to experience sex with someone else to be satisfied.  He said no.  He found the idea intriguing in much the same way you would if you knew you could rob a bank for a million dollars and not get caught or jump off a building without being hurt.  However, when you think about what you lose.  There is something special, well, at least for me, about sacred intimacy and a bond you share with someone that is unbroken.  Maybe other people don't feel it or care, but it's something I like.  I like not worrying about disease.  Relationships are about more than sex and I find it too hard to concentrate on more than one person.  Some people might say that I have been enchanted by the straight couple concept or the fallacy of marriage.  I say that no two relationships are the same and when it comes to defining what is right for you and another person, the only thing you can rely on is your own internal compass and communication.   Then again, maybe it has nothing to do with commitment and sacredness or communication.  Maybe it's just because I'm getting older and too tired to focus on pleasing more than one person at a time.  Am I lazy or is a three-way just too much work?

       THE PILL   "Do you have her?"  "Yes!"  "Watch the paws!  Watch the paws!"  "I've got her!  Do it!"  I pried the jaws open that revealed many razor sharp teeth and Jeff dropped the pill in.  Her eyes burned with defiance.  I closed her mouth and stroked the underside of her chin.  The danger was over with no bloodshed.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, once again Jefffier has given the cat a pill.

       WORD FOR TODAY   Verisimilitude \ver-uh-suh-MIL-uh-tood; -tyood\, noun: 1. The appearance of truth; the quality of seeming to be true.  2. Something that has the appearance of being true or real.   For example, Trevor walked with confidence into the Velvet Spike as the verisimilitude of his bubble butt attracted attention.  However, when a hunky lawyer named, Chet, invited him home to part his ass like the Red Sea with his staff of Moses, Trevor realized that his gel-tush pads would be exposed.

       THE SHOCK OF RECOGNITION   I was just running up the steep hill just past the police station and beside the elephant pen when I saw him.  I couldn't believe it at first.  It was right during the middle of the  Groove Collision Remix  of Sophie Ellis-Bextor's  Mixed Up World , but I recognized him at once.  It was the Bottom Boy... in the flesh!  As some of you may recall, one of the sites that I had a password and user name for changed to a personal Web site a few months ago and I began to receive weekly e-mails with my matches.  It must have been based upon geographic location because the variety I received, and the fact that I had not filled out a detailed profile, brought all different types of men into my In Box each week.  One of them was the Bottom Boy.  Why do I call him the Bottom Boy you ask?  Well, I read his profile with the intent of potentially introducing him to my friend, Mark, back when he was single.  This guy lives in Grant Park and like a nice guy.  At the end of a profile, most of these guys would reiterate something about themselves.  Bottom Boy reiterated that he was a catcher only and he never had and never will pitch, if you get my drift.  I decided that someone who was so rigid might not be a good match for Mark.  Granted, I had never discussed preferences for sexual positions with Mark, but I just felt that if this guy was so rigid in this area he would probably be rigid in other areas as well.  Besides, what was I going to tell him.  "Hi. I saw your ad and I'm not interested personally because I have a partner, but I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine.  What do ya say?"  If I received an e-mail like that, I would quickly block the sender's e-mail address.  Once I actually received an e-mail that had a friend I know through other friends.  He's a real nice guy, but when I saw him recently, I felt it was best not to metion it to him.  Knowing him, I felt that he might freak out a bit knowing that someone he knew saw it, which seems to be the whole point.  It's like people getting upset when other people discover their nude pictures on the Internet.  If you don't want people to find them, don't put them out there or at least crop your head off.  I really just wanted to say, "Hey, I think it's great that you're putting the effort out there to meet other people and I hope you meet someone special."    I considered saying something to Bottom Boy today as he lead his dog into the park, but the whole situation smelt of a freakish awkward quality.  It was best to let it go.  Besides, Bottom Boy didn't look happy.

       PRUNING LIMBS   Last night when I was at the gym and I was pushing myself to the limits on the leg extension, I looked at where my legs disappeared in my ankle socks and wondered if that is what my legs would look like if my feet were amputated.  We react to amputation with such horror at first, but in time we realize it's just trimming some piece off that is no longer useful.  Who has not woken up with a stranger in your arms after a wild night on the town and not considered knawing their arm off to get away without waking up the other person?  Although I'm not eager to lose limbs, I did consider whether or not it would be preferable to lose a hand or foot.  Since I type so much, I think I would be more open to losing a foot because you can still be quite active with a prosthesis.  It's a little harder to type with one hand.  Then again, I know several fellows who are quite proficient at it, come to think of it.

       PATIENCE   I've been listening to the new  urlLink George Michael  CD,  Patience , and I really like it.  I think it's my favorite album he has ever done.  It was a long road to this album when George released  Freek!  back in 2002.  It wasn't received very well.  I didn't care for it much myself.   Shoot The Dog  was the second single and was controversial for it's video showing Tony Blair fetching the stick that George W. Bush throws for him.  The song is pretty cool as it makes use of music and vocals from my favorite Human Leauge song,  Love Action (I Believe) .  If you would like to see the video,  urlLink go here .   Amazing  is the newest single and it's a nice George Michael number.   John And Elvis Are Dead  is an interesting analogy and  Flawless (Go To The City)  is a beautiful dance track for beautiful people.   Freek! '04  seems more appealing the second time around.  I assume it is remixed to some degree.  I believe it's about cyber sex.  My favorite track is  American Angel , which I believe is about George's partner.  I read a year or so ago that he had lived in Dallas for a few years with his boyfriend.  The song is about a cowboy from Texas who stole his heart.  It's a very passionate song about vulnerability.  I quite like it and the Texas thing is just another big plus for me.  I highly recommend it. I ordered mine from  urlLink CD-Wow , which has the best prices I have found and provides free shipping to anywhere in the world.

       PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY   We're having a progressive dinner party on Sunday.  Somehow I ended up being in charge of it.  Maybe it's because I had all the e-mail addresses and phone numbers.  It starts at 6pm and lasts until 9pm.  Four of our neighbors' homes will be opened up for a different course.  The first course is drinks and appetizers, followed by soups and salads, the main course and side dishes and then desserts and coffee.  It was a big success last year and we live on a fun block.  Almost everyone is either named Jeff or Susan.  I'm still trying to get the final head count.  We have more people being added to the list each day, mostly from outside our block.  The more the Maryier I always say.  The more the Rhodaier..... No, it's better the other way.  Anyway, it seems like we have more people waiting until the last week to decide what they will bring and Jeff and I are deciding what we will bring based upon where we are short items.  It should be a lot of fun.  I think I'm going to make something out of my  1001 Chocolate Delights  book.  I bought it earlier this year when I was on the first two weeks of the South Beach Diet.  I was holding the book sideways and looking at the pictures of the desserts as if they were porn.  It's a great diet, but I'm glad I'm beyond the restrictive phase now.  I telling Jeff the other day that there are lots of opportunities for businesses to cash in on the gay market.   I said, "You know we could make a killing off selling custom penis cakes over the Internet."  Jeff looked at me wryly and said, "Don't you think someone has already taken that market?"  I threw my head back and laughed.  "Oh Jeff, you're such a card.  Why you make it sound like gay men think about sex constantly."  Hahahahaha!

       SPLISH SPLASH   So I'm driving back from Decatur where I have just picked up my professional photographs of me in a suit.  Can you imagine it?  Me in a suit?  I swear I must have been hanged in a past life.  Anyway, I drove by a car wash on the way home and decided to stop in and wash my car since it's so hard to do it on the weekend.  I carry a bank pouch with spare change in it in my trunk.  It used to have crayons in it.  (Don't ask!)  Therefore, some of the wax in the bag melted and was all over the quarters.  It was sort of like that Madonna movie that she should not have made.  However, it did improve my love making techniques in parking garages.  I undress, I mean digress.  So I vacuumed out the Miata and washed it and shot a coat of wax on it.  I don't really understand the car wash.  You have all these options and there is no logical order to follow.  You have high pressure wash, rinse, tire degreaser, foaming brush, and wax.  Obviously, you want to rinse after the foaming brush.  I love the foaming brush.  It sounds like a children's TV show.  "And now kids it's time for a visit from Mr. Foaming Brush!  YEAH!"  However, it's not quite as exciting as a visit from the foaming dog because then Mr. Gun comes out of the drawer and BANG!  No more foaming dog.  Sigh....

       SEXY MORTGAGES   So Jud says to me, "Jef, let's you and George get together for a three-way next way."  I almost choked on my toast, but managed to mutter, "Sure.  Thanks."  Yes, it's not every morning you hear that statement at a business networking event, but at a PowerCore meeting it is not uncommon.  Jud is personal injury attorney and George sales all types of insurance.  The point of getting together is to find out what we each do so that we can recognize potential referrals for the other members of our networking team.  Each week, we give a one minute spill about ourselves and our services called an InfoMinute.  I didn't find out that I was accepted by the team until the night before so I had to throw something together.  I took enough speech classes that I can usually come across pretty well, but most people think they know mortgages.  They forget that clients need to refinance to consolidate debt, obtain cash to pay taxes, buy someone out during a divorce, etc.  Next week, I will start my spill as normal and then say, "I'm sorry.  I can't get on.  It's just it really bothers me that people think they know everything about mortgages.  They seem them as dry and black and white, but let me tell, mortgages are sexy.  Now I'm not talking about some guy standing in a bar and some voluptous woman walks up to him and says, "So, is that a mortgage in your pocket or are you just happy to see me.  What do you imagine when you think of a sexy person.  You think confidence, stream-lined, healthy.  That's what a sexy mortgage does.  I take the time to get to know my clients and their needs and what their plans are for the future.  Then I can offer the right product for my customer's needs so that when they talk about their mortgage, they appear confident, their product is streamlined for their particular situation and it creates a healthy financial picture for them.  If you know someone who can appreciate a sexy mortgage, give them my card and ask them to give your name when they call me.  I'm Jef and I have sexy mortgages."  It will be interesting to see how they respond.  I'll keep you posted.

       AM I TRULY AN INTERNATIONAL MALE?   Ever wonder why hot dogs come ten to a pack and hot dog buns come eight to a pack?  Ever wonder why no matter which locker you put your gym bag in, the only other person at the gym is always right next to yours and you're both trying to change at the same time?  Ever wonder how no matter where you move, the  International Male  catalogue will always find you?  What is  International Male ?  It's a menswear catalogue with hunky models that sport the finest in casual wear, athletic wear, swimwear and underwear that is so brief you could almost call it underestimatedwear.  Now when it first showed up in college it was probably the closest thing to actual porn that I owned.  The models were very inspiring and I actually cut out a few pictures that I posted next to my weights.  However, I never actually ordered anything from the catalogue.  Years later I did order a tank top and a modest swimsuit.  Once I ordered a cool mesh club shirt, but it was very creepy to actually wear.  It felt too much like having thousands of live crickets all over my torso and I had to send it back.    I often wonder who buys the exotic outfits from  International Male .  Now even if I had a perfect body, I'm not sure that I would wear madras plaide swin trunks, huraches and a black wool fedora.  What would it say about me if I did?  It would sort of send out mixed signals as if I was a detective looking for cheap rum at a Greek mixer.  I can safely say that I don't need any shape-enhancing swimwear bringing anymore notice to my crotch than I already have.  I was happy to see that the producers finally bought that black opera trench coat that Neo was wearing in the last two  Matrix  flicks.  I didn't think they would ever sell it.  And although the faux leopard pocket thong and Samoa shark took necklace are intriguing, where would I wear this smart little ensemble too?  The grocery store?  Church?  Moreover, does the cutout ribbed bodysuit seem too much like super hero lounge wear. Would I feel too much like one of the Super Friends in his off hours relaxing at home with a low-carb smoothie?  Finally, in spite of sexy assurance that the model exudes while sporting the powder blue camo muscle T with the melon clamdiggers, can I safely say they are truly back in style, and more importantly, really me?  I think not.    So who are the people buying the merchandise from  International Male ?  Someone has to be doing it because I keep receiving catalogues.  They have to be making money.  If you are one of these people, please comment and tell us more about yourself and what you buy.  Inquiring minds like to know.

       MY HEAD IS SPINNING   Princess has not felt well for the past few days.  At first, I noticed that she was very vocal and needy on Tuesday.   That night, she kept getting in and out of bed all night long.  That doesn't sound like that big of a deal except that she likes to crawl across me to get to the center of the bed where she likes to sleep.  At one point I woke up and she was sitting on my chest meowing at me.  I knew it had to be because I was getting up at 5:30am to go to the PowerCore meeting.  When I came downstairs I found little puddles of cat urine with blood.  Now I knew what she was trying to tell me.  I petted her awhile and left her in her little cat bed.  When I returned from the meeting, she was outside with Jeff and seemed to be doing better.  Last night, she had another accident and seemed to be uncomfortable.  Jeff worried somewhat that she would die during the course of the night, but I assured him that although she apparently had a urinary tract infection, none of the symptoms seemed severe enough to go to the emergency room.  However, she did seem uncomfortable and I was anxious to take her to someone we could trust.  This morning we called around to all of our pet rescue friends and got referrals for vets.  The one around the corner from us is awful.  Princess cussed him out... literally.  For various reasons, we finally got an appointment with her old vet on the southside.  It's a little further than we would like to drive, but we'd rather take her to someone we can trust.    Jeff picked us up and I scooped up Princess in a towel and we sort of looked like a ragtag nativity scene with the cat as a Baby Jesus.  I practiced looking solemn down to the vet's office and kept waiting to look at someone at a traffic light and shout brightly, "IT'S A GIRL!"  The vet checked her out and did a great job.  She gave her some fluid and a cortizone shot.  It's always funny to watch Princess have her ears and teeth checked.  Her eyes roll back in her head and she looks like Norma Desmond.  "I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. Demille."  The vet said that we have to give Princess a pill once a day for a week.  We just looked at each other and then Jeff said, "Well, I guess that's okay.  I haven't put my winter coat up yet."  We normally place Princess on top of the washing machine and don parkas and heavy gloves.  One of us will hold her with a towel around her paws and the other one pries the mouth open and drops the pill in there.  The first time we tried sans winter wear and we were both anemic for a week.  Anyway she is in the dining room asleep under the dining room table.  I expect this is the first decent rest she has had in several days.  She woke up once and meowed to ask where I was.  I told her I was in the den working and she went back to sleep.  Isn't it amazing how animals and people learn to live with one another and understand one another.  I guess I will try and get some work done now.

       IT'S OH SO QUIET   It's been a good day.  I took a run around the park this evening.  I packed Scott's CDs to send to him in far northwest.  Jeff and I had a nice chicken Caesar salad for dinner.  I'm set to go to my PowerCore meeting tomorrow, although I'm not excited about getting up at 5:30am to drive to Marietta.  I guess I'll need to get used to it because I'm about to do it every Wednesday morning.  I feel like my energy is moving again.  Does that make sense?  I don't feel like a ball bouncing in place anymore.  I took some time today to move my personal belongings out of the filing cabinet next to my desk and start setting up work related files.  The personal files were just begging for reorganization and a thorough, merciless cleaning.  I have a pendaflex folder that will hold everything I need nicely.    I found a folder with stacks of scripts, short stories and poetry that I have written over the last ten years.  I had a very prolific poetry period.  I'm not a rhymer.  I just like to express my thoughts, and God forbid, my feelings.  I'd like to reorganize it and put in on-line.  Poetry is fun because each line can be a snapshot of emotion or theory or conceptual.  I have a dark secret that I am loathe to admit.  I like that Britney Spear's song,  Toxic .  I tried to run and I tried to hide, but I finally heard it and I like it.  I know that it's only because Cathy Dennis wrote it and she's my girl.  (Along with Kylie, Sophie and Bananarama, etc.....)  Remember Cathy Dennis?  She sang on D-Mob's  C'mon and Get My Love  back in 1990 and had hits with Just  Another Dream ,  Touch Me (All Night Long)  and  Too Many Walls  back in 1991.  She co-wrote a lot of her stuff with Shep Pettibone, the 80's remix king who became a producer in the early 90's.  He produced  Vogue ,  Rescue Me  and the  Erotica  album for Madonna.  Anyway, Cathy released a second album,  Into The Skyline , that pretty much flopped in the states.  It was more A/C than pop or dance music.  She released a third album,  Am I Your Girl , and it was her equivalent to Kylie's  Impossible Princess .  It was very rock-oriented.  Then she decided she was tired of performing and began writing songs for S Club 7, Pop Idol winners and the American Idol winners. Her most famous composition is Kylie's  Can't Get You Out Of My Head .  I guess that explains why she is the eighth richest women in England.  It's very quiet here tonight.  My mind and body is beginning to wind down.  There is still lots that I would like to do tonight before I go to sleep, but I trust that it will all be there in the morning.  I'm beginning to believe that Jefffifer will actually go on vacation this year.  The dream was beginning to die with me.  We were supposed to go to the UK last summer.  Jeff wanted to visit Scotland and I wanted to visit Ireland.  We planned a brief stop in London so I could check it out and possibly stalk Bananarama.  I'm not a fan.  That's short for fanatic and fanatics do fanatical things.  I like to think of myself as more of a Bananarama enthusiast.

       IT'S BEEN A GOLDEN GRAHAMS DAY TODAY   For some reason I was beginning to feel discouraged with work lately.  I've had one deal that through no fault of my own was slowly going south and the other leads I was receiving seemed to be going no where.  I realized that I needed to turn my attitude around so I began making a list of what I wanted to create in my life and one list of what I wated to release from my life.  I began to visualize my life the way I wanted it to be and if negative thoughts cames to mind, I turned them around into something positive.  I also went intensified my organization of my desk and bedroom.    The first time home buyers seminar went great last night.  I received several compliments on my presentation and more importantly the attendees asked intelligent questions and seemed very thankful for the information.  Unfortunately, some of them need some help with credit before they will be able to purchase, but I feel much more confident in my presentation than I did yesterday.  I received three good leads today back to back.  I also received a call from Tracy at PowerCore that I have been accepted by the team that I visited last week.  I'm going to the meeting tomorrow morning.  My pictures are ready to be picked up on Thursday from the photographer so I can proceed with my advertising.  People say they are great pictures, but I just look so unnatural in a suit in my humble opinion.  I received a voice mail message from my client who has the deal that seemed to be going south.  He is supposed to call back tonight to discuss the situation.  I also spoke with the lender and he will decide if he can offer a compromise after looking at the market tomorrow.  Is it magic?  Is it positive thinking?  Is it just a coincidence?  I don't know.  I'm just thankful.

       MAY THE FACE R.I.P.   LONDON - Poor sales have forced the closure of The Face, the influential British pop culture magazine, publishers announced Friday.  An innovative design and an edgy take on music and fashion made the 24-year-old monthly a beacon of cool throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It suffered a sharp decline in circulation in recent years, however, and attempts to sell it failed.  At its peak in the mid-1980s, The Face had a circulation of more than 100,000 copies a month. The latest figures from July to December 2003 showed that the number had dropped to about 40,000.  "Despite initial interest from a number of different parties, we have been unable to secure a suitable buyer for The Face and have therefore decided to close the magazine," a spokesperson for Emap PLC said, adding, however, that the publication could reappear "at some stage in the future."  Launched in 1980, The Face played a major role in predicting music and fashion trends, including the rise of British designer Vivienne Westwood, waif chic, the rave scene and the revival of Britpop. The publication was also widely credited with kicking off the career of a 15-year-old Kate Moss, who was featured on the magazine's cover in 1990.  The Face's innovative use of graphic design and fashion spreads by forward-thinking photographers helped revitalize the British magazine industry.  "The whole look of it, the style, the typography -- everything was very sexy and suddenly everything around it looked conservative," former contributor Paul Morley wrote in the Times of London in March. "The reason for The Face's demise is that everyone else caught up and overtook it."  The last issue, dated May 2004, appeared in early April.

       AS TIME PASSES BY   So I'm doing my first home buyers seminar at six o'clock this evening.  I'm ready to do it now.  I'm finding it really difficult to concentrate because I'm ready to do it.  I'm going to leave a little early to go work out before hand and pick up some bottled waters and cookies.  I think it will go well, I'm just ready for the show.  We haven't had a lot of calls so I'm expecting it to be small, but all we need is one loan to make it worth while.  Buddy has been in a mood all day today.  It's raining and muddy outside.  Princess can't go out so she has been talking all day long.  She even drug her muddy self across the magazine I was reading at lunch.  I guess she's been spoiled with the sunny weather and lounging outside the past week or so.  I did accomplish quite a bit this weekend.  I have Scott's CD's ready to mail tomorrow, but I'm waiting on one last track that is on my laptop, which Jeff has.  I'll finish that tonight and mail them tomorrow.  I've been working on these for at least a year.  I've made them much more difficult than they needed to be, but I can't really explain it.  I just know that I had to get them done.  It's personal.  I'm tired of setting goals and not finishing them.  I did manage to get things cleaned up in my bedroom quite a bit.  I still need to sort through some more stuff, but I made good headway.  I just have too much stuff to go in the space and I need to find a way to get rid of what I no longer need and a place to store what I need to keep.

       DOH!   I opened my eyes this morning and realized that the 2F's is not returning home until Monday night and he has my laptop, which I need to use to project my Powerpoint presentation onto the wall at my first time home buyers workshop on Monday night.  I remained in a corpse position for several minutes even going so far to lay my hands across my chest as if I were holding a lily.  I had let Jeff borrow the laptop to work on his business plan for his book store without thinking that he would not return until Monday night.  I guess I will print the presentation out and pass them out at the workshop.  It doesn't appear that we are going to have that many people, but if one person shows up, it was worth it.  Plus, the presentation and the script are done.  Isn't it amazing that we use scripts in other areas of our lives besides just making movies?  If we walk into a store and the clerk asks if we need help, we reply, "No, I'm just looking."  It's a script.  If we are in the habit of saying goodbye to someone each day, it's basically a script.  If we try to pick someone up in a bar, our line is a script.  "Hey, baby, what's your sign?"  As is their response.  "Do not enter."  Well, my day did not start out quite as I had planned.  I was planning to go to church this morning, but my momentary panic through me off schedule.  Being somewhat numb, I decided to go run around the park and get the energy flowing again.  It was a nice run.  I took my MP3 player with me and I think I have sorted things out.  Everything will be fine.    I will finish scanning some pictures for our historic neighborhood calenar.  I will finish making those CD's to mail to my friend, Scott, in Oregon.  I will work on designing the new blog - Cult Of Jef 2.0!

       MY NIGHT WITHOUT YOU   2F's left to out of town for business this afternoon and it's just me and the cat tonight. The weather is hot and I can understand why people embrace the nudist lifestyle.  However, they probably don't have all the windoes that my house has.    I worked out this afternoon and saw the little red hair girl.  She just smiled and waved at me.  I always turn around to see who she is greeting so enthusiastically.  It really throws me off when she does that.  I went to Borders Books this afternoon to just hang out a while.  Time has published a very nice special magazine about the seven wonders of the world.  I was very tempted to buy it, but the last thing I need is more stuff, right?  When I was six, I received a talking viewmaster for Christmas.  It was longer than a regular viewmaster in order to store the batteries and the viewmaster reels had a clear plastic disc attached in the back.  When you pressed a bar on the back of the viewmaster, it would play the recording.  Anyway, I had one reel about the seven ancient wonders of the world.  I was always fascinated by it and have always had a fondness in my heart for the seven wonders of the world.  I read a bit about the hanging gardens of Babylon, which they are still a bit unsure if it really existed.  I bought a Sunday paper tonight, which has always confused me as to why you can buy a Sunday paper on the Saturday before the Sunday.  Moving on, the main feature in Parade magazine is about a man who went to Iraq to see some of the biblical places.  One of those places was the hanging gardens of Babylon.  Coincidence?  Yeah.  There is also a particular place in a village in sourthern Iraq that they believe is where the Garden of Eden was.  It was an interesting article.  I also read about castration throughout the ages tonight.  Evidently there were three ways they would do it: cut the testicles out of the scrotum; tie a piece of matierial tightly around the testicles and they will slowly die; or someone would stomp on them and crush them.  If I had to choose, I think I would go for number two.  I believe that is how some of the men in the Heaven's Gate cult castrated themselves.  I also discovered that if a man is castrated after pueberty, he will still retain most of his secondary sex characteristics and can achieve erection, but he will be sterile.   In the middle ages, priests used to put young boys into a warm bath and give them liquor or opium to relax them and then cut their testicles out.  I guess that's why the Catholic Church hasn't commented much on the Michael Jackson case, huh?  In the U.S., in the early part of the 20th century, anyone who was found to be mentally incompetent was sterilized and this continued until just after WWII.  Now that GLBT people are not allowed to marry, I wonder how long it will be before someone decides we should all be sterilized?  I went by Publix in hopes of finding some more tiramisu, but alas, there was none to be found.  I half-heartedly chose some marbled cheesecake and some boneless chicken strips.  That was my wild dinner tonight.  Jason lent me a copy of the  The Robbie Williams Show  and I watched it tonight.  I must say, Robbie is the consumate entertainer.  He is very charismatic on the stage.  It was filmed at Pinewood Studios in the UK and was televised to generate publicity for his forthcoming album,  Escapology .  Of course, it's two years old now.  I like Robbie's music.  It has a seventies feel to it with a good dose of tongue in cheek humor.  I just got off the phone with 2F's and I'm feeling rather tired. I think I may turn in soon.  I want to get up early so that I can go to the early service at church tomorrow.  I promised to help a friend tomorrow afternoon.

       JUST LIKE PAST-LIFE REGRESSION   I was peeling an orange when it occured to me that it would certainly be much easier if we could just objectively view the world and our interactions with other people as objectively as people who go through past-life regressions.  We could watch ourselves be spurned by past lovers that now are our siblings our boss with no remorse whatsoever.  We could watch ourselves drown and be hanged without flinching.  We could accept it for being just what it is and not analyzing it into something more than it is.    I have begun receiving e-mails from a Kylie Minogue mailing list.  I believe that I signed up for it years ago before she regained her recent popularity.  The e-mails stopped for many years and now, like a scorching case of herpes before the prom, they have returned home.  Ironically, there is not much Kylie news in the e-mail.  There is some sort of flame-war going on between several members of this list and I received 43 e-mails in one day about using profanity in posts.  I wonder if these people had ignored the offending party to begin after his initial offensive e-mail, if the whole situation could have been prevented.    I finished reading  Shopgirl  this evening.  It really spoke to me and at this time, I would say it's one of my favorite books of all time.  It's not a happy book, but it's not an unhappy book.  It just is.  It is thought provoking in its examinations of love, sex and relationships.  The last few lines about pain really stood out for me.  I wonder if I would have liked this book if I had read it at any other place in my life.  Unfortunately, it eroded my theory about experiencing our pain and lives objectively.  Pain motivates us too much to be unnecessary.  Perhaps we will be numb with our pain for years or even a lifetime, but if we run to the precipice of that agony and throw ourselves off into the unknown of joy in the last few seconds before our final breathe, we have succeeded.  Now I keep thinking about past-life refreshin'.  Maybe I can create a reality show based upon extreme makeovers of the people we may have been in other lifetimes.  When you compare it to some of the actual programming on television, it's not to far out there.

       THE PERFECT PITCH   I just e-mailed the PDF with my treatment and first ten pages of my screenplay to IMAGE for the Perfect Pitch contest.  I cannot tell you what a great big sigh of relief I just heaved.  Thanks to Jeff for some last minute proof-reading.  I cannot tell you how much thought and energy went into avoiding this and mulling it over and over and over.  It's done.  I may pop open a bottle of champagne and smoke a cigarette.  I had to write a one-page treatment, which is sort of a prose summary of the movie.  It gives a brief overview to the producer so they can decide whether or not they want to spend the time reading the full screenplay, or more likely, have their assistant read it.  Most treatments are five to fifteen pages long so it was challenge to condense it down to one-page.  I couldn't find any resources on-line or in books that told how to do that.  Therefore, I did the best I could.  The script itself was pretty easy.  I typically find if I just sit down at the keyboard and start typing, the right stuff flows out as if I am channeling or taking dictation.  I don't put a lot of thought into what I'm writing, but I find that there are a lot of layers to it when I reread it.  I don't know how I do it, I'm just glad it works.  The one-page treatment took longer than the script did.  I suppose your thinking, "Why is this so important?"  Well, for one thing, there are many things I have wanted to do in the past, which have not come to fruition because I have always been responsible and done other things first with the bit of spare time that I have.  Second, I have come to believe that if I want to do anyting with my creative talents, I need to start taking them seriously and showing them some respect.  Although it would be nice to pitch my script to the panel of judges and go to Hollywood to meet with production companies, I'm just glad that I set the goal and actually did it.  Way to go me!  I'm going to paste the treatment into this post.  Unfortunately, the screenplay was written in FinalDraft and I can only produce a PDF.  If any of you are interested in reading the first ten pages of the screenplay, e-mail me and I'll send it to you.  Damn!  I just realized that now I need to write the other 110 pages of the script.   TREATMENT  What do you want to be when you grow up, Millicent? asks her third grade teacher.  I want to be a gynecologist and a LPC so I can provide counseling while doing pap smears for busy women on the go.  It just makes sense, doesnt it?    And so we meet Millicent Myers, a precocious eight-year-old who has grown up in a world of adults and is incapable of relating to other children.  After being sent to the school psychologist for help with her atypical eight-year-old attitude, Millicent finds herself giving marital advice to Mrs. Tweedy instead of receiving professional guidance.  After her father, a police officer, died in the line of duty, Millicent has spent her afternoons with her next-door-neighbor, Chuck, a professional photographer who treats her as if she were an adult.  While her mother is at work, they play games such as supermodel photo-shoot, lets fire the board of directors and movie star diva throws a tantrum on the set.  Naturally, she falls in love with Chuck and has their life together all planned out when Mr. Neitzke enters the picture.  You see, Mr. Neitzke is Chucks new boyfriend. Not only does he take Chucks attention away from Millicent, but he is a challenge to the control that she has over her life. After trying every trick in the book to run him off, what is a little girl left to do?  Why, plan to do Mr. Neitzke in, of course!   Through her creative imagination, Millicent consults with the most infamous murderers and murderesses of history on how to do the evil deed, while the ghost of her father tries to talk her out of each diabolical scheme.  In the end, Millicents unfortunate mother seems to walk right into each trap and foil Millicents evil plans.  Finally, one of Millicents schemes goes too far. Chuck rushes to the hospital with her mother while Millicent is left alone with Mr. Neitzke and the realization that she may have hurt the one person who loves her the most.  In doing so, Millicent discovers that Mr. Neitzke is not such a bad guy after all and decides to left him live.  In the end, Millicents mother recovers. Millicent says goodbye to her fathers spirit while taking her first steps toward learning what it is like to be just a little girl.

       DREAMS ARE FUNNY   I dreamt last night that Jeff and I went to a cowboy bar and he wanted to dance to country & western music.  For some reason, I wanted to watch the gay cowboys dancing together for awhile first.  Jeff decided to ask another guy to dance and they went two-steppin' around the floor.  A slow song came on and I saw Jeff dancing with his head on this guy's shoulder.  I found myself becoming angry and hoping for his sake that he was unconscious and the other guy had to hold him that way to keep from falling down.  Of course, then I was suddenly in the Amazon River Basin as you normally are in dreams and then I woke up.  I was still angry with Jeff.  He told me good morning and I said, "How could you dance with somebody else like that?", went into the bathroom and shut the door.

       LESBIAN CLUE   Troy at Sometimes Happy has got me thinking about lesbians lately.  I love lesbians.  I love them in every size and color.  Heck, I'd be one myself if it wasn't for the fact that I'm gay and have outdoor plumbing.  (Do you know what I'm talking about?)  Somehow I started thinking about lesbian board games and wondered what a Lesbian Clue would be like.  For some reason, I thought about Coach Mufftutuff in the gymnasium with vibrator.  Mother Earth in the kitchen with the turkey baster.  Ms. Pussywillow in the parlor with a....?  Hmmm, what would you say?

       BLOG LIKE BREATHING   I have discussed blogging with many people lately.  What is it that captures our attention?  One friend enjoys my blog because he feels sort of like a peeping tom sneaking a peak inside my life.  I like the friendships I have built with people from all over the world during the past few months.  What once began as a click of exploration grew to a daily dose and then caring about the people I check in on daily.  If they do not post something new each day, I begin to worry if they are okay.  There are so many different types.  Some blogs are gossip. some are political, some are a menagerie of interesting news articles, some are daily journals, some are a creative outlet: they're all good.    I find that my mind is always going now.  I'm constantly observing my thoughts and conversations for anything that might be "blog worthy."  If something captures my attention, chances are, other people will find it interesting too.  I must blog each day, sometimes several times a day.  It's become  a necessity for me, like breathing.

       YETI SIGHTING   I have become enchanted by  urlLink The Yeti , which is a comci strip created by Beastmomma's friend, Ben.  It appears daily on his Web site,  urlLink New Monkeys .  It is a visual media blog.  He line drawings are so simple and drawn with just enough detail to see the picture clearly, but not too much.  There is not dialogue.  The story is told through action and facial expressions.  It reminds me of some of the great children's books of my youth or the cover for the first They Might Be Giants album.

       I'M ECSTATIC FOR ANDYMATIC   I have a secret.  I've been fighting it for a long time, but I just love reading  urlLink Andymatic .  He is always posting interesting political commentary on his blog, which is written clearly and concisely in a way that I can easily understand.  Why even yesterday we discussed Diana Ross & the Supremes and scrotums!  Where else can you do that?  The irony that I live with someone who works in government and have several friends who are political junkies is not lost on me.  I like the way Andy states the facts and they interprets the situation from his point of view.  If anyone disagrees with his commentary, he politely responds back.  He usually brings up a few good points that I have never considered and for the most part, I find his writing to be more objective than subjective like some blogs of both political persuasions.  I immediately tune out anyone who says anything like "Bush is just an idiot because I don't like him."  The only thing that happens in that instance is that I know you don't like Bush and I should not listen to you.  I may not agree with the man on many points, but if you are going to criticize him, or anyone else, have some facts to support it.  This just contributes to the insanity in our political system.  One party is always criticizing the other and it is so counter-productive.  I sometimes think it will take a disaster to allow these two parties to look beyond their differences and work together.  Anyway, the point I am trying to make is that I recommend Andymatic and you may want to visit his blog.

       READING GLASSES   When I was 19, I bought some faux glasses at Hulen Mall in Fort Worth.  I think my boyfriend at the time had bought some and I thought they were cool.  I've always had good vision.  I found them in a drawer a year or so ago and put them on my desk.  Sometimes when I feel that I need help writing, I put them on and imagine they give me special writing powers.  Oddly enough, it always seems to get me over the hump.  Glasses make me feel like a writer.  Several years ago, I read a book on creative visualization.  The author taught some inner city school children to imagine they were putting the head of a famous artist on top of their neck and create some artwork.  Ironically, the artwork improved.  It's amazing how making a suggestion like that can change everything.

       WRITER'S GROUP   Not knowing how many members would be coming tonight, I was somewhat befuddled as what to offer my guests tonight.  Fortunately, I had some cheese and a summer sausage that I cut up along with a green apple. I also baked some of those chocolate chip cookies with caramel in the middle.    It was just Tim and I tonight.  Charles has a class on Wednesdays and Rick is understaffed and overworked.  He'll be out for a while.  Tim told me I was a model of domesticity or something like that.  I laughed because nothing could be further from the truth.  After all, I'm the guy who stapled my costume together for a play in college.  I gave my review of Carrie Fisher's The Best Awful and Tim gave his impressions of The Nannie Diaries.  He's not going to finish the book if that gives you any indication.  He said that after he took some writing classes, he began to read books for the writing and structure and he doesn't just read for the story any longer.  As a result, he is not afraid to walk away from a badly written book.  We discussed if this was due to poor editing and came to the conclusion that editors are overworked and more unpolished work is being published.  I read  Thelma's Dilemma  and Tim gave it a thumbs up.  I'm actually proud of my little piece on testosterone.  I'm writing more and more about straight couples.  I'm okay with that, but I wonder if it says something about me psychologically.  We discussed Charles' short story,which we both liked, but had different interpretations of the ending.  Charles has a good command of detail.  He gives you just enough, but never too much.  I've finished half of  Exfoliation  and Tim gave me his feedback on it.  It was very positive with a few suggestions about some places being a bit mello-dramatic and questioned whether the sex scene was necessary.  I'll have to think about that.  I was trying to get across how lust sometimes causes us to Jeckle & Hyde between personalities.  That may not have been clear. The sex scene may not be necessary.  I won't have time to look over it again until next week.  I ask a lot of questions about feedback.  I want to make sure that I understand what's being said.  There's nothing worse than getting back to your computer and trying to figure out what someone has said.  I'm proud of this story.  I feel like I'm channeling it more than actually writing it.  Rereading some sections, I'm amazed at some of the foreshadowing and multiple layers that are there that I did not consciously create.  I'm learning a lot by writing it.  Tim and I talked for the rest of the meeting about how his blog and Web site came around.  It was a remarkable story on so many different levels.  I had to tell him this is the essay he needs to write to send in to NPR.  There are so many incredible layers to the story.  I learned a lot more about him tonight.  Now I understand his logic and thinking a little bit more.  Maybe I'm fooling myself.  I think we bonded a bit tonight.  It was cool.

       NETWORKING UPDATE   I received a call from the visitor coordinator this afternoon.  She thanked me for stopping by to the PowerCore meeting this morning.  I received a second phone call from another member who told me I gave a very nice presentation.  He talked with me a bit about the group.  Evidently, the realtor in the group gives all of her mortgage leads to her husband, who is a loan officer.  Still, there is a CPA, a financial planner, insurance agents and other professionals in the group.  I have a good feeling about it.  I faxed my application in and we will wait and see.  I'm just glad that my presentation was well perceived.  I hate not being prepared.  I've noticed that I'm not longer struggling on the inside with my job. I'm staying in the moment and just focusing on taking care of my self after last week's funk.  Tonight I received a lead.  There's a part of me that says it's connected.  Is it?  It's not hurting me to believe so, therefore, I will continue to do so.  I like to see myself unleashing my ferocity upon an unsuspecting world. Hey!  I could be drinking alone.

       REARRANGING THE FURNITURE   As many of you may know, my desk now sits in the middle of the den due to the hole in the ceiling, which exposes the pipe to the upstairs shower.  This means that the futon is moved back, almost blocking the doorway.  I would hate to think what this is doing for my feng shui, but I have quickly adapted.  In fact, tonight Jeff was working on the computer and I came in to sit on the futon and just rest a moment with him and the cat.  It was very nice.  Jeff went up to bed and I sat on the futon for a few moments and read a couple of pages of  Shopgirl .  It almost felt like I was in a new home.  It feels good to change things up a bit from time to time.  There are so many analogies for furniture.  When we rearrange the furniture in our lives, we walk into it at first, but we soon learn to walk around it.  What things are you walking around in your life?  Why don't you rearrange them?

       MINDFUL THREADS   I had a visit from Gregory at  urlLink Mindful Threads  today and I really like his blog.  Ironically, he is in Fort Worth where I lived as a teenager and could not wait to escape from.  I find his writing and self-examination interesting.  Perhaps you will too.

       YES, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, HE'S STILL ALIVE   I was surprised to find that I was easily aroused from a deep sleep this morning.  The clock said 5:55am.  I showered, put on my best suit and tie and headed for the  urlLink PowerCore  meeting.  What is PowerCore you ask?  It's a networking organization with little cell groups all around the Perimeter of Atlanta. They include a representative from almost every field.  The mortgage seat on this particular team is now open and I was invited to attend by Bill.  There was one other mortgage person visiting today and I'm sure there will be more before the team decides on a mortgage person.  More importantly, I had the opportunity to see how a team meeting works, meet contacts and practice my InfoMinute, which is a 60-second self-promo.  It's very effective.  Now, keep in mind two things about me: (A) I do not like to wear suit and ties and I'm sure that I was hanged in a past life, and (B) I am extremely shy around people I do not know... especially in a business setting.  Therefore, going to a networking function is a huge step for me and also good for me to move beyond this limitation.  The meeting is on the other side of town so I printed out directions and laid out everything I would need the night before.  I woke up in penty of time and drove to the hotel where the meeting was held.  I listened to both Bette Midler and Uncanny Alliance's versions of  I'm Beautiful Dammit!  on the way to put me in just the right mood.  When I arrived, I was in a for a bit of a shock.  I didn't see any PowerCore people.  The breakfast area was full of people, especially Army personnel in cammies, but no one I could identify from PowerCore.  I asked the girl at the front desk where the PowerCore meeting was. She looked at me for a moment as if I had just asked if she was planning to eat her on liver, because if she was not, I hated to see good food go to waste.  I asked her again, but spoke a little slower and more clearly.  When she tilted her head to the side in the manner of a curious Jack Russell, I found myself asking again in a louder voice as if the problem was due to the fact that she was deaf and not because I was using a term foreign to her.  Fortunately, she found a manager who knew what I was talking about and led me downstairs to the meeting.  "We only know it by PowerCore, nothing else," he told me.  The meeting already started, which is my all time greatest pet peeve.  There was one chair left beside a woman who enthusiastically greeted me to the fold.  I feared she might try to hug me in a warm effort of welcome. So each of us went around the room and gave our spill about some particular aspect of our industry.  You cannot talk about it all in 60-seconds so you have to choose one aspect to focus on.  The members were relaxed and were able to conduct business and laugh at the same time.  When I spoke, I discussed working with first time home buyers and included a super hero story of how I had helped a recent client.  They responded to the super hero story.  I either speak very slowly, time collapsed upon itself or I wrapped my spill up at 30-seconds instead of 60-seconds.  It's hard to know because everything was so new.  I didn't embarrass myself, so I was happy.  One person gave a seven minute presentation, which was interesting to learn about flooring.  Then we went around the room and discussed common misconceptions about our industry.  I touched on how most people think they have no need for a loan specialist if they arlready have a home and drew their attention to people who need to cash-in the equity on their home to pay taxes or consolidate debt, in the instance dividing up property for a divorce and the financial benefits of investment property.  One guy asked if I actually asked potential customers how their marriages were doing and I responded back that since I only had 30-seconds to speak, I cut to the chase this morning.  This seemed to get a laugh.  Then members traded referrals.  Since I was not a member, I did not have any referrals to give.  I liked the group so I'm going to apply for the seat.  I have business cards from several of the members so I will follow up with them and try to give a few referrals.  Obviously, I want to make myself look good, but I also want to establish relationships with people who will take care of my customers with the same care that I do.  I picked up my newsletters from Kinkos today and they look fantastic.  I sent them off in the mail today to my client database.  I also printed some color flyers for the first time home buyers workshop to put out tomorrow.  Robert wanted to put some black and white ones up with a big black streak across them.  I don't know what he was thinking.  He's usually a stickler for that kind of stuff.  He seems to be doing well, but he said the other day that he still doesn't like working alone.  On the other hand, I'm finding it easier and easier to be independent.  I still have some follow ups to do, so I'll wrap this up.  I'm still amazed at how quickly the black funk came and went last week.  I feel so much better now.  Things are looking up.

       I'M BEAUTIFUL, DAMMIT!   I was going through some of my CD singles this evening and I came across Bette Midler's cover of  I'm Beautiful  by Uncanny Alliance.  I know some of you will find the lyrics timely from discussions we have been having.  Others will just find the words entertaining.  Enjoy!   "That's it, baby! When you got it, flaunt it, flaunt it!"   "This is the Divine Miss M and I'm here to share with you some rare and stimulating insight into my cosmic fabulosity. It's really very simple. I smiply believe with all my heart:"  I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit! I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit! I'm beautiful, so beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit! I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  "Go away, little girl," they used to say. "Hey, you're too fat, baby, you can't play." "Hold on, miss thing, what you trying to do? You know you're too wack to be in our school."  Too wack, too smart, too fast, too fine, too loud, too tough, too too divine. I said you don't belong. You don't belong. Too loud, too big, too much to bear, too bold, too brash, too prone to swear. I heard that song for much too long.  Ain't this my sun? Ain't this my moon? Ain't this my world to be who I choose? Ain't this my song? Ain't this my movie? Ain't this my world? I know I can do it.  I'm not too short, I'm not too tall, I'm not too big, I'm not too small. Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself! Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself! I'm not too white, I'm not too black, I'm not too this, I'm not too that. Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself! Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit! I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  It's time to call it what it is. Don't play the naming game. Become what you were born to be and be it unashamed. "Go away, little boy," I can hear them say, "Everybody on the block says they think you're gay. Hold on, my friend, do you think we're blind? Take a look at yourself. You're not our kind."  Too black, too white, too short, too tall, too blue, too green, too red, too small. I said you don't belong. You don't belong. Too black, too white, too short, too tall, too blue, too green, too red, too small. I heard that song for much to long.  Ain't this my sun? Ain't this my moon? Ain't this my world to be who I choose? Ain't this my song? Ain't this my movie? Ain't this my world? I know I can do it.  People always ask me, "Miss M, how did you get so far on so little?" Shut up! Well, I woke up one morning, flossed my teeth and decided, "Damn, I'm fierce!" You look good! You can be just like me! A goddess? Yeah! Don't just pussy foot around and sit on your assets. Unleash your ferocity upon an unsuspecting world. Rise up and repeat after me: "I'm beautiful!"  I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful! Can you say that? I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful! I don't hear you! I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful! Louder! I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful! Hey!  That's it, baby, when you got it, flaunt it, flaunt it!  Aaaaaah! Ain't this my sun? My sun! Ain't this my moon? My moon! Ain't this my world to be who I choose? Ain't this our song? Ain't this our song? Ain't this our movie? Ain't this our movie? Ain't this our world to be who we choose?  I'm not too short, I'm not too tall, I'm not too big, I'm not too small. Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself! Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself! I'm not too white, I'm not too black, I'm not too this, I'm not too that. Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself! Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself! I'm beautiful, dammit!

       THELMA'S DILEMMA   Thelma considered the tube on the kitchen counter.  The cigarette between her lips shifted directions as her mouth changed moods from indifference to hopelessness.  It appeared as if she was trying to pick up an answer to her dilemma via the little antenna in her mouth.  Lighting the cigarette, Thelma picked up the tube and inhaled.  Testosterone, she finally said while releasing the smoke from her lungs.  Quickly she turned and looked at the kitchen windows to ensure that she could not be seen.  The gossips in this small town made the CIA look like amateurs.   Unscrewing the cap, Thelma brought the tube to her nose.  It didnt smell so bad, but she would remember to tell Dr. Evans that the drug company might want to add a little floral scent to give their testosterone a more feminine touch.  Dr. Evans told her to apply the gel to her skin and it would be absorbed into her system.  She had been so uncomfortable at the appointment to talk about sex that it did not even occur to her to ask questions.  Where was she supposed  to put this stuff?  Certainly she wouldnt put it down there!  What if it burned?!  Then again, the whole reason she went to the doctor was to put some sizzle back into her love life.  Jolene swore testosterone saved her marriage and wagered it could save Thelmas too.  Turning the oven light on, Thelma checked the tuna casserole and then flipped the switch off.  Tuna casserole was Georges favorite dish.  Looking at her reflection in the glass, she assessed her new hair color.  Thelma had been afraid that it might be too bright a red for her skin color, but Jolene assured her that the color would ignite the desire in George like a match to kerosene.  Thelma sure hoped so.    Picking some lint off her green pant suit, Thelma took another drag on the cigarette and put the tube on the counter.  She just couldnt believe George could be a homosexual.  The women of Scuttlebutt County knew that the men sometimes hung out at the rest area by the Interstate, but they thought it was just to drink beer and talk on their CB radios.  However, Jolene had seen part of a special about the iced tea trade on Hard Copy. She had been flipping channels during the commercials of Little House on the Prairie. Evidently these men met in the rest rooms at comfort stops.  They dressed up in womens clothing, drank sweet tea and did unmentionable things together.  Thelmas blood began to boil as she envisioned Georges glasses fogging up as he bit the buttons off a truckers shirt.  Thelma had been grateful that George didnt trouble her with his needs too often.  She had assumed that his sex drive had tapered off over the years and that he was focusing what little energy he had left into the hardware store and the mens group at church.  Mens group!  HA!  Jolene must be right.  Thelma had even baked some goddamn brownies to send with him each week.  With nuts!  And hadnt the hardware store been a clever cover all these years?!  There in the temple of masculinity, surrounded by nails and screwdrivers in all their pecker-like glory, George had conducted a cult of perversion.  Now Jasper, get a feel of this Philips in your hand and tell me if anything could be more natural.  Is that a screwdriver or what?    Thelma felt her lips growing warm from what little was left of the cigarette and quickly put it out in the ash tray.  The lipstick print on the end of the butt taunted her. Its your own fault.  You call yourself a woman?  Youre nothing but pear-shaped bowl of Jell-o!  Thelma swore not to let a nicotine scrap get the best of her and immediately dumped the contents of the ashtray down the garbage disposal.  She found her anger vanished as she tripped the switch with a loud whirr.   Whats for dinner hon?  Thelma jumped and turned to see George standing in front of her.  She had to handle this situation delicately and work her way up to the question some time between the tuna casserole and key lime pie.  George, are you a faggot?  At the funeral, Thelma could not erase the sight of George clutching his chest as he fell to the ground.  Tragically, Jolene advised her at the hospital that the men were indeed just drinking beer and playing with their CB radios.    In order for Georges death not to have been in vain, Thelma had him buried in a pair of her tummy-control panties.  She figured that if she had killed George as a homosexual, the least she could do was bury him as a transvestite.  The story had already spread all over town so she couldnt just say that George died as a straight man from natural causes.  In her mind, it seemed like the most loving thing she could do.

       SHOPGIRL   I mentioned earlier that I began reading Steve Martin's  Shopgirl  last night.  Even now, I still can't help but marvel at how wonderful his writing is and what a witty and charming story he has begun to weave for me.  It's a short book, only 129 pages and I highly recommend it... especially anyone who may be looking for love.  I have posted a review from Amazon.com below.   From Publishers Weekly Movie star Martin shone in the comic essays of last year's Pure DrivelAbut can he write serious fiction? His debut novella gives fans a chance to find out. Shy, depressed, young, lonely and usually broke, Vermont-bred Mirabelle Butterfield sells gloves at the Beverly Hills Neiman Marcus (nobody ever buys); at night, she watches TV with her two cats. Martin's slight plot follows Mirabelle's search for loveAor at least romance and companionshipAwith middle-aged Ray Porter, a womanizing Seattle millionaire who may, or may not, have hidden redeeming qualities. Also in and out of Mirabelle's life are a handful of supporting characters, all of them lonely and alienated, too. There's her father, a dysfunctional Vietnam vet; the laconic, unambitious Jeremy; and Mirabelle's promiscuous, body-obsessed co-worker Lisa. Detractors may call Martin's plot predictable, his characters stereotypes. Admirers may answer thatAas in Douglas CouplandAthese aren't stereotypes but modern archetypes, whose lives must be streamlined if they are to represent ours. Except for its love-hate relations with L.A., little about this book sounds much like Martin; its anxious, sometimes flat prose style can be affecting or disorienting, and belongs somewhere between Coupland and literary chroniclers of depression like Lydia Davis. Martin's first novel is finally neither a triumph nor a disaster: it's yet another of this intelligent performer's attempts to expand his range, and those who will buy it for the name on the cover could do a lot worse.

       LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE WAS THE BEST THING EVER   So we were discussing a story mentioned in The Quest For Wholeness the other day at church.  The author mentioned a woman by the name of Evie, who had  urlLink Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS  as it also known.  Evie hated herself and her body, which she referred to as a big bowl of Jell-o.  Given only six months left to live, Evie decided that she would try to to find one thing about herself to love each day and she did.  Confined to a wheel chair with no hope, she worked with a finger and then another to eventually come to truly celebrate every aspect of herself.  Mysteriously, she did not die.  In fact, she recovered.  What does this say about the human mind?  What is love really?  It is really so much more than romantice love.  "John!"  "Martha!"  Although, I think we can reach a level of truly understanding what love is within a relationship, but not typically from the love that ignites the fires of passion.    This story has stayed with me for the past few weeks and especially last week when I could find so little around me to lift the black feeling that had descended on me, yet I kept trying to find something good in every moment.  I feel somehow that my little bout of depression is linked to that story.  I find myself looking at new ways to see myself and love myself.  I'm not speaking of love in a maudline sense or a celabration of mastubatorial delight.  Do we ever stop to wonder how marvelous every cell in our body is and what a miracle our bodies are.  Our personalities are wild mustangs that run freely and cannot be tamed.  Why do we label ourselves and try to put ourselves into little boxes of who and what we should be?  I've listed some information on ALS below for those who are interested in learning more.   ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, is an incurable fatal neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness, resulting in paralysis. The disease attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurons, which control the movement of voluntary muscles, deteriorate and eventually die. When the motor neurons die, the brain can no longer initiate and control muscle movement. Because muscles no longer receive the messages they need in order to function, they gradually weaken and deteriorate.  The initial signs of ALS may vary. Symptoms include stiffness and increasing muscle weakness, especially involving the hands and feet. The disease eventually affects speech, swallowing and breathing. Because ALS only attacks motor neurons that control the body's voluntary muscles, patients' minds and senses are not impaired.  Approximately 14 cases of ALS are diagnosed each day nationwide. Most of those who develop the disease are between 40 and 70 years of age. The average expected survival time for those suffering from ALS is three to five years. At any given time, approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with the disease.  The cause of ALS remains unclear, and no cure exists. While there is no drug to prevent or cure the disease, recent breakthroughs have resulted in Rilutek, a drug that modestly slows the progression of ALS.

       AFTERNOON MUSINGS   I'm sitting here in the late afternoon reflecting on my day.  I've been very productive.  The PowerPoint presentation for the home buyers workshop is almost finished.  It's at the point where I have to step away, sleep on it overnight and look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow.  I had lunch with Robert today.  It's amazing how his mobile phone rings constantly.  It's amazing to watch him in action as he speaks to someone for a few moments and then skillfully rearranges them to a later telephone conversation that may or may not happen.  It gives the appearance of productivity, which is best viewed through fun house-mirror eyes.  The perception is exagerated and out of proportion.  Still, he is closing two loans this month.  Robert is a fantastic people person, but I could never act the way he does.  It would come across as cheesey.  He is one of those rare, authentically cheesey people and he wears it well.  The house is open.  It's hot and I'm wearing a bluish-grey Polo T-shirt and some jeans.  The jeans barely stay on my body.  I have lost so much weight over the past three months, which is good.  I look good, but I'm still dismayed at the remainder of body fat still firmly bubblewrapped around my awesome abs.  How much running and jumping rope will this require.  Wouldn't be great if there was a little device that could tell you that?    I wasn't meeting with clients today and dressed comfortable to slay the PowerPoint dragon that has been haunting me.  I'm tooling through my mind on a tiny motorcyle looking for new avenues of marketing and lead generation that I have not been down before.  There must be some other stone I have not overturned.  The lead from last week has not returned my phone calls.  Things happen for a reason.    I've spent about a month putting systems into place that should begin producing leads and customers.  Money is not a problem at the moment.  I find myself eager to find some clients to work with.  I'm ready to work my magic so to speak.  However, when I'm slightly distracted, I catch a glimpse of a hopeful feeling in my emotional-intuitive vision that seems to say something good is going to happen next week.  However, when I try to turn and look at this feeling more closely, it's gone.  All that remains is a ghostly knowing.  I feel it is somehow tied to my shift in attitude about prayer. I didn't pray for anything last night or this morning.

       RANDOM BRAIN PURGE   I'm happy to report that I seem to have moved beyond the black cloud that had settled upon me last week.  I'm now beginning to pick up where I left off.  If I owe you an e-mail, please be patient.  I have a lot of deadlines this week and I will get back with you as soon as I meet those.  It was a little hard to concentrate yesterday morning, but by 1:11pm, I moved into hyper drive and seemed to finally have a break through with my Powerpoint presentation.  I'll finish that up this morning.  I went to the gym yesterday evening.  There was a new guy there who was certainly inspirational.  I think he was attractive.  Ironic as it sounds, I really don't pay attention to guys in that way at the gym.  I go to work out, do it and then leave.  Anyway, he was about my body type, maybe a little bigger frame and gave me a good idea of the direction I'm heading.  I've gained a lot of strength over the past few months and I'm lifting more weight now than I ever have.  I should really begin using some protein powder.  The interesting thing to note is that I seemed to have made more progress this time by just showing up and working out and not really having any goals to bulk up and have the perfect body.  I think there may be some wisdom there.  I'll continue to meditate on that and get back with you.  I read my chapter this week in  The Quest For Prayer , which is a book we're studying at church.  I'm actually getting ahead because they are taking more time with the old book.  As I was reading last night, I had the feeling that I really needed to be reading this book at just this moment.  I've always been confused about what prayer really should be.  In the chapter, the argument is made that we don't really pray to "get things," we pray to experience God.  There explanation is somewhat like meditation.  The authors, Mary-Alice & Richard Jafolla, state that there are three phases to prayer: surrender; stillness and letting God.  It is through this practice that people and situations change, not because we have asked God to change them, but because we are ourselves have been changed.  The proof that prayer works is that we are exhibiting loving kindness.  Interesting!  So this morning I experienced the stillness and it was very powerful for me.  Then I opened my e-mail and had a big fat opportunity to bestow loving kindness upon someone I am experiencing frustration with on the volunteer front.  I think I did pretty well.  No blood was shed.  Jeff and I tested the shower upstairs and the leak into the den seems to be fixed.  We'll patch the hole up this weekend.  Some friends of Jeff are tentatively scheduled to visit in about two weeks.  As I look around the house with holes in the ceiling and boxes of books everywhere and my desk in the center of the den, I can only throw my head back and laugh like those little kids on the  Peanuts  cartoon specials.  It will come together.  One of my clients just called.  The closing that was scheduled for today has been postponed due to a stop work order from the city.  Evidently there is a septic tank issue.  I threw my head back and laughed again.  I'm glad I don't live paycheck to paycheck because this loan probably won't close for another few weeks.  Come to think of it, this is the loan that my boss encouraged me to use a 15-day lock on.  I should have used a 60-day lock.  In other news, I was able to borrow the photographs again from my neighbor that I had previously scanned and were lost in the hard drive fiasco.  I scanned about half last night and I should be able to get everything together for this year's historic calendar.  I went to bed early last night, about 11:18pm for me.  The windows were open and I could hear a dog barking in the distance.  The sheets were cool and soft and I leaned back against my favorite, fluffy pillow and began reading Steve Martin's  Shopgirl .  He is such a fantastic writer.  I so want to be him.  Here's a little spook fact for you.  Steve Martin lived in Waco, Texas and I lived in Waco, Texas, but not at the same time.  Weird, huh?  I've got a big day ahead of me.  Robert is coming down around 1:00pm and we are going to work on the presentation for the home buyers workshop.  Tomorrow is a meeting with a business networking group that has a mortgage seat open. I will vy for it along with a few others.  We'll see how it goes.  I need to review my short story and book review for tomorrow's writers group meeting here at the house and go to the neighborhood association meeting tonight.  Somwhere in there, I'm going to jump rope or run.  It's going to be a Golden Grahams day!

       ETYMOLOGY OF ETHNITICITY   I was taking my apple break a few minutes ago and it occured to me that the names we have for different ethniticies are all wrong.  Not many of them sound flattering.  I mean, caucasian.  It sounds like some form of treatment for venereal disease.  Negroid sounds like a second-hand monster that wasn't tall enough to attack Tokyo  Hispanic sound likes like a term for a spasm that occurs when you realize there is a spider crawling up your body and you hispanic.  I've never been fond of the sound of the word Jew and that may be partly due to all the anti-semetic movies I've seen where it was said with such hatred.  On the other hand, I am partial to Pacific-Islander and Eskimo.  Asian sounds mysterious, but sounds like it could be funk'd up a bit.  So what words would I substitute?  At present, I'm partial to Whack'ds for caucasians although I'm not sure why.  It's just fun to say I guess.  I'm still working on the the others.  Any ideas?

       SNIFF!  SNIFF!   I'm sitting her finishing up my first time home buyers workshop Powerpoint presentation at a painfully slow rate.  It's not hard, I'm just easily distracted, but my mood has changed for the better.  Every once in a while, I smell something.  I'm beginning to think it's me.  It's not a bad smell, per se, it just doesn't smell so fresh. I wore this jeans once before, but not for long.  The shirt came out of the upstairs closet where it had been placed for the winter.  I did shower this morning and applied all the nice smelly substances.  I hate it when I have that not-so-fresh feeling.

       PERFECT PITCH   I was beginning to give up on finishing my entry into the  Perfect Pitch  contest.  Things kept happening that seemed to point toward just letting it go or losing my sanity.  However, I just decided to let it go with the intention that if it was meant to be, I would receive a sign.  I then focused on the problems at hand.  Friday night, I went with Jeff to visit a thrift store and a used book store.  He finds great books at great prices for his book store at thrift stores.  In fact, I found two James Bond collections there.  He also likes to visit used book stores to see what works and doesn't works to give him ideas for his own store.  So we visit this used book store in Decatur and we're walking down the aisle and I see a copy of  Writing Treatments That Sell  by Kenneth Atchity and Chi-li Wong.  It was standing upright on a shelf by its lonesome with the front cover facing outward toward the aisle.  There was a light from above shining directly down on it and I think I might have heard a chorus of angels. This was a book that I had read about in several places on the Internet as I was doing my research on writing treatments.  I got the message so I picked it up and bought it.  Then I worried about the time it would take to read the book, but in fact, the portions I needed to read were in three chapters that I was able to read in one afternoon.  It helped me focus my story and gave me a few tools that helped me create a more exciting hook at the beginning and I have a much clearer idea of how to go back revise the treatment and get cracking on the first ten pages of the script.  They are due by Friday at 5:00pm.  If selected, I'll need to submit a completed screenplay by May 15th.  As crazy as it sounds, I think I can make it happen.  It feels so good not to feel weighted down by that funk anymore.

       HOW ARE FRIENDS SEE US   I overcame the last part of the week and the weekend, which were unusually rough for me.  I'm not usually affected by such things, but I think I understand what the message was from the whole experience and that's not something I can easily put into words to explain to other people.  It was interesting to see how some of my friends react when I go through a difficult time.  In some ways, my friends no me well and in some ways they do not.  It's always interesting to hear the words of encouragement, advice and interpretation of why certain things are happening to me.  Many times the interpretations are way off, but I smile because I know they mean well.  Still, if I were to die and people were interviewed about who I was, I wonder how accurate the interpretations would be.  I guess everyone I know is purely my interpretation fo who they are and is not necessarily pure.  Makes you think.

       SMALL STEPS TODAY   I woke up this morning feeling much better about things.  In meditation, the message I received was to take a step back and take care of myself a little differently and it's changed my goals some what.  In fact, I'm setting less goals this week.  I'd rather achieve a few things and then tackle a few more if I have time, but I was setting too many for right now and that was adding stress to my life.  I had to set some priorities for this week.  This week is about staying in the moment no matter what the appearance is in the outside world.  My goals are a little more spiritual/internal in focus than worlld/external focused.  It doesn't make sense to my intellect, but it makes sense to my gut and when I follow my gut, things usually work better.

       GYM DELIM   I went to work out at the gym on Saturday morning.  They have a new girl working the front desk.  She has red hair and she always smiles at me and I smile back.  I've always wondered what they do up there.  I like to think that she sometimes checks on the guys in the showers to make sure they are cleaning behind their ears and knees, but I know that must be illegal. Saturday morning she smiled at me in a real big way.  I couldn't help but smile back.  As I walked away, I realized that she was flirting with me.  She thought I was attractive.  Then I kind of got giddy like in the  Rudolph  puppet special where he jumps around saying, "She thinks I'm cute!"  Then I remembered that I'm gay and I have a partner.  This has been happening a lot in the last six months.  Now, I'm wondering how do I continue to be friendly without encouraging her or making her believe that I find her repuslive?  I was telling a friend about my situation.   "Just tell her you're a total fag!"  "No.  There is no reason for me to come out and say, 'Hi, how are you?  By the way, did I ever mention I was gay?'"  "How 'bout, 'Hey there!  Don't ya just love sucking dick?!'?"  "I don't think that's going to work.  That's just pretty crass and awkward.  There has to be some lead in to the topic of my sexuality."  "Okay, how 'bout, 'Hi.  How ya doin'?  What about those Braves last night!  Don't ya just love suckin' dick?!'?"  "You know, it scares me that you are a respected professional in the Communications field."  "Yeah, but you'll get your message across, won't ya?"

       DONUT DRAMA   You know that you have been together for awhile when you have little arguments over everything.  If I say black, he says white and vice versa.    Last night we drove up to the  Krispy Kreme Donuts  on Ponce De Leon.  I'm not a big donut person, but since I did not find tiramisu last night, I wanted something sweet.  (Doesn't tiramisu sound like a giant drag queen that should cha cha through downtown Tokyo and battle Godzilla?) I decided a chocolate-frosted cake donut would be perfect.  Jeff can always be talked into going to  Krispy Kreme .  On entering the building, they had a picture of their  Donut of the Month , which was a strawberry shortcake donut.  I decided I must have one, but alas, there were no strawberry shortcake donuts at the inn.  Why would you be out of your  Donut of the Month?  In fact, there were no chocolate-frosted cake donuts either.  I ordered two chocolate-frosted regular donuts.  We decided to get half dozen.  Jeff ordered two glazed and one jelly-filled.  I ordered a caramel-filled donut in addition to the other two.    Upon arriving home, I discovered that in place of my chocolate-frosted regular donuts, the guy behind the counter gave me some chocolate-frosted cream-filled donuts.  YUCK! I just wanted a feral chicken to fly in the kitchen and peck my eyes out.  Could anything possibly go right?!  I ate the caramel-filled donut and went to bed.  This morning I got up and was going to eat my donuts, which I really shouldn't be eating anyway since I'm on a quest to have a stomach that I can grate cheese on by this summer.   Jeff offered to give me one of his glazed donuts after the previous night's donut trauma.  I asked him if he wanted one of these chocolate donuts.  Jeff didn't answer.  He asked me if I wanted a glazed donut again.  We went round and round for a few minutes.  It reminded me of the Georgia State Legislative session all over again.  I eventually decided to eat both of the chocolate donuts since Jeff really likes the glazed donuts and it wasn't his fault they guy gave me the wrong donuts.  Then Jeff is put out with me because I didn't eat one of his glazed donuts.  I know he meant well and offered me his glazed donut out of love, but I was already feeling out of it as it was and now I just wanted to stick a donut up his butt and spin it on my finger.    I took a deep breath and let it go.  I looked at him and said, "I appreciate your offer, but I just decided to eat the donuts that the guy gave me.  I know how much you enjoy the glazed."  Then I brushed my teeth and went to church.    Later after lunch, we were sitting around the dining room table reading the Sunday newspaper.  He got up and I said, "You know even when everything is blah, thinking about you still brightens my mood."  He got up and hugged me and I felt better.    If I have learned one thing in six and a half years, it is that you always have to keep working at relationships.  Sometimes just saying little things can go a long way.  You may not always be on your best behavior, but if your partner knows you're doing the best you can at that moment, they'll usually work with you.

       ACTING OUT   This morning I woke up feeling drained.  I have no idea why.  I got eight hours of sleep last night.  I had intended to go to the 9am service, but it was 9:10am when I woke up.  I jumped in the shower, grabbed a quick bite for breakfast and headed to the my Quest class.    Susan asked where I had been since she had not seen me in a while.  Still groggy, I explained that some friends had performed at other churches and I had gone there to watch and support them.  I guess she thought I was being defensive because she said she hadn't been there all of the last three Sundays either.  I was too out of it to worry about it.  We were discussing love and wholeness today.  One woman spoke up and said that she had heard someone say recently that when we are born, we are our true selves without any apologies, but as we grow older, we learn how to act like others expect us to be.  We behave how others expect us to be.  We do what others expect us to do.  She said that in every instance where her life has gone awry, she has acted out instead of being true to herself.  This intrigued me.  We talked about how we are all one and why this is the most difficult commandment that Jesus gave us.  I made the comment that we often have problems loving others as Jesus did because we grow up learning that love is a romantic love between a man and a woman.  Boys and girls date and base the selection of their spouse upon their personality or the behavior displayed by their ego, but not demonstrative of their essential spiritual nature or soul.  However, when we are unable to forgive or love anyone unconditionally, it is usually because we cannot see past the personality of that individual as Jesus did.  I then gave two examples of what I have other people say recently.  One happened to be from an acquaintance who lamented a co-worker, "If she wasn't such a bitch-on-wheels, I could forgive her."  The class laughed, but in a edgey way.  I sense they think I'm a morose artsy type.  They most likely have me pegged as someone who likes to set things on fire.  The blonde woman beside me thought it was funny.  I was just trying to make a point.  I wasn't trying to be funny.    The blonde mentioned that she had been working on loving George W. Bush because he was the closest thing she could find to someone that she could consider an enemy.  That intrigued me.  Can I forgive George W. Bush?  I haven't lost a loved one in Iraq. I then realized how hard it must be for some families right now.    In closing, Susan did a summary of our discussion today. When she mentioned forgiving an irritable, romantic partner, she looked in my direction.  I believe she thinks that the bitch-on-wheels is my girlfriend.  Boy, is she barking up the wrong tree!

       GOT MILK?   Saturday was turning out to be a continuation of the latter part of the week. There was a lot to do, but I seemed to be getting very little done.  I was taking wet clothes out of the washing machine when Jeff called me outside. I sighed wondering what marvel of nature he desired to share with me.  Then became angry at myself for becoming irritated at what he was choosing to share with me from a loving place.  So I walked outside onto the front porch and Jeff points down the street to the house on the corner.  Our neighbor, Michael, was standing on the front porch with his girlfriend, Rachel, and they were being married in front of a menagerie of friends and neighbors.  It totally melted the stress away.  Jeff and I sat down on the porch swing and watched.  It was interesting from our perspective because the edge of the roof cut off their heads since we are further up on the hill than Michae's house is. We watched the legs and feet throughout the rest of the ceremony.  Our nextdoor neighbor, Phil, came out on his porch and asked what was going on.  I told him to grab a woman and we could make it a double ceremony.  He threw his head back and laughed a laugh that only Phil can laugh.  I will write more about Phil at a later time.  He's an interesting guy.  Shortly after, we heard the minister tell Michael to kiss the bride and the ceremony was over.  Jeff laughed that he was glad he had come out front first because he was about to start up the weedeater in the backyard.  I told him that since they were probably about to have cake, I was going to walk down there and ask if they had any milk.  He smiled at me and I smiled back.

       SUNDAY AFTERNOON   There is still a hole in the ceiling above my desk, but we think we fixed the leak, which was coming from around the drain in the upstairs shower.  We'll test it later once the silicone has had an adequate amount of time to dry.  At present, my desk sits in the center of the room.  Everything is back in order for the most part.  The printer is connected, although I haven't hooked the fax back up.  I think I'll save that for tomorrow.  I finally took the PC into Best Buy and had them work their magic on the soundcard and the second hard drive.  Unfortunately, I lost everything on the second hard drive, but it's accessible again and now I have sound.  I finally got the DVD player working about a month ago.  It feels so good to have everything working on the computer for once.    I'll catch up with blogging later.  I've had a ton of ideas going through my head, but I've been overwhelmed by a lack of energy and general malaise.  I think I'm processing something.  It's akin to Depression Lite. "It tastes just like depression, but with only half the calories!"  It's not a bad thing.  Our feelings are thoughts in motion in the body and they want to be heard.  Hence, I'm just taking care of myself today and doing what I feel led to do.  I may actually watch TV in a few minutes since the Divas Las Vegas is coming on VH1.  Supposedly, Kylie has rejoined the show again.  If nothing else, Debbie Harry will be performing and that's enough for me.

       JASON CONFESSES   I looked him in the eye with no expression.  "Say it."  "No," he replied with a slight quiver in his voice.  "Say it I say!"  "Okay.  I like  Slow  and  Red Blooded Woman  and the song before  Loving Days , but I really don't listen to the rest of the album."  The corner of my mouth turned up in a sinister smile as  I turned my back to him and walked to the window.  I looked at the children playing in the street below and wondered when their youthful innocence would be run over by the great, hulking Chrysler egos of their former pop stars that suddenly want to be taken seriously.  Crushed by the weight of a Locomotive.  "Everybody's doing a brand new dance now," I slowly sang just loud enough for myself to hear.  I turned around quickly, clicking my black boots together with with a Gestapoesque flair.  "And why is that, Jason?"  "Because she wants credibility."  I moved closer.  "And why does she want credibility?"  "Because she wants to be considered an...  an..."  I removed my black leather glove and slung it back over my head as if to strike him across his cheek.  "Spit it out you cowardly fool!"  "AN ARTIST!  Kylie wants to be an artist!"  He crumbled to the floor in deep sobs and I lowered my hand to my side.  I hadn't wanted to do this, but Jason must understand.  We can't let our pop stars grow and expand and try new things.  They're best when they keep doing what they do best and what we fans like over and over and over for eternity.  I can read her  Body Language , Jason, and it's not pretty.  It's no good.  It's not  Fever .  It's not even  Light Years . Get it out of your head."  I crossed to the door and with my back still to him I said, "You're free to go now."  He still continued to sob quietly.  I couldn't leave him like this.  I reached into my coat pocket and threw the gold hot pants over my shoulder.  The crying stopped at once and I heard the sound of mice scurrying across the floor to a random morsel unexpectantly dropped to the floor.  I didn't have to turn around to know that he was joyously lost in rubbing the gold lame all over his faces, his eyes closed.  He was pathetic, but how could I deny him that one last pleasure to hold onto?

       DINNER WITH JASON   So Jason says to me, "I hear that we're getting  Die Another Day ,  Like A Virgin  and  Live To Tell ." His hands are antimated as he sheds the paper skin of the straw and places it in his lemonade, which has ominously come to the table in a stainless steel tumbler.  It's as if the contents are radioactive and will burn through an ordinary glass.  "I don't feel like we're going to get anything else from  American Life , which is a shame because I thought it was a great album."  "I don't listen to it much."  "Why?!  It's some of her best work ever.  Of course, I felt the same way about  Music ."  "I actually liked  Music ."  "You would.  Well the Europeans can't get enough of it, but then again European men wear thongs and cross their legs like fags and it's no big deal.  I guess they are more manilier than American men."  "I never thought of it in... quite that light."  "Still, she has been practicing a rifle and flag routine so we could be surprised."  "I like her old stuff.  I wish she'd sing  Burning Up ."  "Too obscure.  This is Madonna, not the Eurythmics.  I envision that she will sing a  Vougue/Deeper And Deeper  medley.  Of course, their bascially the same song anyway."  "Well, I don't know if I would agree with-"  "Which night are you going?"  "I don't know.  Brian is buying the tickets.  He's a member of some secret society of Madonna so he got first access or something."  "Do I know Brian?"  "I don't believe so."  "Where does he live?"  "In a condo in Midtown and before you ask, I don't have a criminal background check or a blood type to give you."  "Hahahahaha! You're such a card!"  "And you're almost a full deck."  "You're going Saturday night.  Everybody is going to be there.  It's fantastic because we can all go out dancing afterwards.  You know, Sean and Hillery and I are almost in the same spot as we were last time.  We're just five rows further back.  It's just like the planets falling into allighment with every day that brings us closer to July 26th"  "You know, you're the only person I know who can turn a Madonna concert into a vision quest.  Herds of buffalo have been hunted, skinned and smoked with less effort."  "Well, this isn't about survival, Jef.  This is about everything that matters."  And with that, he chugged the entire glass of lemonade, slammed it down on the table, threw his scarf back around his neck and let out a high "C", "Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!"  Dinner with Jason is always interesting.

       GETTING THERE FROM HERE   Okay.  I just said, "Screw it!" and ripped my work clothes and put on shorts and a T-shirt.  I then pulled everything off my desk and have put everything back in place.  Somehow the power cord from the Officejet 7110 was pulled out.  I swear I haven't been shaking any office equipment like Joan Crawford.  Hey, I can type with an Elmer Fudd accent.  "Office ekwipmunt!"  Ha! Ha!  They will be coming to take me away soon.  That's okay.  I like to travel.  Today has pretty much been shot to hell so I may just try to fix the sound card and get the information off the second hard drive.  I've needed to do them for awhile.  Maybe the universe is just trying to tell me to get it together.  The ceiling looks ugly above my desk.  Perhaps it will refrain from caving in upon for awhile longer. At least I feel like I have finally accomplished soemthing today.

       WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS... SO WHAT!   I could blow off the fact that the black ink cartridge ran out of ink even after we refilled it with the inkjet refill kit last night.  I could even deal with not being able to find an image I need for producing this year's Grant Park calendar on the GSU Web site.  I could not deal with being unable to find half the pictures I scanned a few weeks ago and discovering that images I just gave back to a lady were actually at 72ppi when I had scanned them at 600ppi.  I would have banged my head against the wall, but it really doesn't burn that many calories.  I e-mailed Jeff and he called to talk me down and I had to just tell him that I appreciated his effort, but I just needed to be left alone right now.  I sat quietly and stared at the monitor.  I cannot afford to lose a day to unfortunate circumstances or a bad attitude, but I felt like nothing was going to elevate me out of this hell hole unless Keren and Sarah from Bananarama stopped by to see if I wanted anything from Taco Bell.  Eventually, I began moving a finger, then two.  Finally, I started moving again.  Things happen for a reason.  There is always a lesson somewhere.  I make the choice whether to continue on or shut down and let me tell you something - JEF DOESN'T SHUT DOWN!  Got it?  Okay.  At that point, the phone rang and it was a potential customer.  He had picked up one of my cards on the bulletin board at the gym.  Nice guy.  He's going through a divorce.  Some areas are strong, some are a little challenging, but can be worked around.  I'm doing some research and he's going to gather documents.  We'll meet on Monday.  Most of all, my marketing efforts of the last month are beginning to show results.  It's a little glimmer of hope on a dark day.  I think I can actually go get a new ink cartridge and some lunch now.  No funk is going to get the best of me!

       ONE OF THOSE DAYS AGAIN   Today I woke up and just getting out of bed seemed to be a chore.  What's up with that?  I feel a bit overwhelmed at the moment and I have to cosciously focus on "one step at a time."    It doesn't appear that Jeff and I will be going out of town this weekend.  The ceiling above my desk is about to fall down from some sort of leak from the shower upstairs.  Needless to say,we're showering down stairs now.  It appears that the entire weekend will be spent on fixing it.  Since we don't know how long it's going to take, we're clearing the whole weekend to work on it.  I could get stressed about it, but what good would it do?  It's simply an exercise in shifting priorities around.  I'm having doubts now about entering the  Perfect Pitch  contest.  I've been focusing on work and there has been some commitment every evening this week.  I can put something together still, but I'm wondering if it's feasible.  If I'm selected to pitch my script to the panel, I need to have the entire screenplay finished by the second week in May.  I could probably do it, but I'm worried about the quality and my state of mind.  Plus, there are already so many other things I have to do.    For now, there are certain things for work that must be done today.  There are some things that I need to work on, but I'm kidding myself if I think they will be finished today.  I'm resurrecting my  Power Hour .  What is the  Power Hour  you ask?  It's where I dedicate exactly one hour to something that I'm working on.  I work only that project for an hour.  After sixty minutes, I move on to another project for an hour. I have found that it's actually more productive than trying to finish anything in one day.  It's my A-TYpe personality that has the conflict.  Oh well... everything is a growing experience, aye?

       TWILIGHT ZONE REVISITED   I received a very nice note from Rod yesterday evening.  It was a happy note.  He's dating a nice guy and things are going very well.  He confirmed that he is in a much better place than he was the last time I spoke with him.  I'm so glad.  Perhaps we'll stay in touch this time.  I'll reply back to him once things calm down around here a bit.  I'm still sort of reeling by the strange twists of events that led me to find his Web site.  Ain't life grand?!

       AMENDMENT ACCURACY   A friend of mine has just sent me an e-mail.   urlLink USA Today  is running an Internet poll with this question:  urlLink "Should the U.S. pass a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage?"   Currently 66.9% of participants say yes and 33.1% say no.  About  a month ago, it was reversed.    Feeling curious, I went to the site and voted, hit the Back button and voted again.  I laughed.  I imagined all of these Christian Coalition stay-at-home mothers hunched over the keyboards and voting "yes" over and over and over with a mad look in their eye.  Obviously, this kind of information cannot considered since the results may weigh heavily upon a few and not all who voted.

       INTERESTING ASHCROFT THEORY   I have let my Favorites get horribly out of hand as I have just been hitting click to save them in no organized fashion.  As I was sifting through them and cleaning them out tonight, I came across  urlLink Gay Porn Blog .  Naturally, these words catch my eye because I own no porn whatsoever and couldn't even tell you the name of a current porn star if I tried.  Knowing that there must have been a reason why I saved this link, I clicked over to have a sticky beak (Australian slang for having a look around.)  This is what I find:   Titan's Bareback Policy  Oh boy, here we go! Let the games begin.   Titan Media has released, what I believe is, the first public anti-barebacking policy statement ever made by a gay porn studio. (Click MORE to read the original statement and their later clarification statement.) I would never have thought that such a statement would cause a controversy, but it has. Mark Adams, of Vidio View, has begun posting responses from individuals in the industry. There are some very compelling arguements made by three studios that produce barebacking videos, but I urge you to read all the statements and come to your own conclusions.   Here are the arguements in a nutshell:   ANTI-BAREBACKING -people learn by example. It's better to teach safe sex rather than unsafe sex practices. -barebacking studios are exploiting the issue merely to make money.    PRO-BAREBACKING  -it's a pro-choice issue, just like abortion. People should have the right to choose.  -the rise is AIDS cases is primarily due to lack of judgement caused by drug abuse.   Each side points out hypocrisy whether it's employment discrimination based on behavior, selling pre-condom vintage movies, knowingly partnering HIV positive models with HIV negative models in supposedly "safe" scenes, and not requiring testing.   I think it's time for the industry to hold a conference on the issue and meeting each other face to face to come up with some industry-wide policies and practices. Barebacking producers are not going away, and neither are the thousands of videos produced before the age of enlightenment.   Rumblings around the industry are that Ashcroft is going to be coming after the porn industry and they are going to hit us from an angle OTHER than Freedom of Speech. The new threats to the industry will be in the form of regulating it to death. Health and safety of employees and consumers will be one of the ways that government at local, state and national levels will be make it economically unfeasible to run a business in the adult industry. The industry needs to put aside it's petty differences and develop a united front to prepare for the upcoming war to systematically discourage legitimate businesses from making a living producing adult material.   Who's ready to set up a summit meeting of gay porn producers with health professionals, lawyers, lobbyists, legislators and spin doctors?    I have to admit that the whole barebacking scene disturbs me.  When I came out in the mid 80's, there three pages of obituaries in each issue of  This Week In Texas (TWIT) , a now defunct gay periodical.  With the exception of my first boyfriend, who I know had never been with anyone else, I've always had safe sex.  It's ingrained in me and it's non-negotiable. Now, I have friends who are in monogamous relationships, that have been tested and have unprotected sex.  That is based upon a level of trust that has been built over time, not someone they just met at a party.  I'm just astounded that anyone would jeopardize infection themself or anyone else when it's not necessary.  However, it's fascinating to see how barebacking has become so common place in gay culture.  Furthermore, I find Gay Porn Blog's prediction of the porn industry being the next target of Ashcroft very interesting.  It would be a nice diversion to go after all those homosexuals who want to screw one another without condoms and give everyone aids.  What a wonderful way to propagate fear and hate.  I'm not saying that I agree with this theory, but it's interesting none the less.  Furthermore, at what point does gay culture begin censoring its behavior to be more acceptable to the main stream?  Does it need to settle down and be respectable or should it fight fiercely for its right to be spontaneous in sexual freedom?  I don't have the answer.

       ONE OF THOSE LITTLE TWILIGHT ZONE MOMENTS   I have a tale to tell.  I'm still a bit amazed by it, in fact.  I never cease to be amazed at how life can be stranger than fiction sometimes.  Let me explain.  Back in 1997, I first started surfing the Internet and I found the Bananarama Mailing List.  Yes, I was not alone.  There were other people out there who were just as fixated upon Keren, Sarah, Siobhan, and yes, even Jacquie, as I was.  It was sort of like finding out that other people like to dress up as fuzzy animals and have sex too.  Anyway, I signed up and began finding out there were remixes I didn't know about and that the guy who started it all lived about two blocks away from where I had just moved from in Dallas and I never even met him.  One day I came in contact with Rod and we found that we also shared a love for other artists produced by Stock/Aitken/Waterman.  We both liked Rick Astley, Dead Or Alive, Kylie Minogue, Brother Beyond, Jason Donovan, Sabrina, Mel & Kim, Hazell Dean, Pat & Mick, Big Fun, Sonia, Lonnie Gordon, Donna Summer, etc.  Somehow we discovered that we both shared the same birthday as well, September 13th.  I think I'm actually a year older.  There was another fan who lived in Atlanta, Richard, and somehow we discovered that he had the same birthday too.    Soon after, Rod came down to Atlanta to visit friends and he, Richard and I went to Agnes & Muriels for lunch.  We celebrated a belated birthday and came back to my apartment to watch Bananarama videos and listen to rare DJ only remixes.  (I cannot believe how incredibly geeky and sordid this sounds.  However, as my friend, Adam says, "Keep it real.")  So we spent an afternoon enjoying our favorite girl group in the world.  Rod and I kept in touch by phone a few times and he came back a few more times to town and I went out with him and his friends.  Eventually, he reached a point in his life where he needed take a respite from other people and his life at the time.  I spoke to him one more time a few months later.  He sounded  a bit distant, but he believed he was doing the right thing he needed to do at the time and my gut said let him be.  About a year or so later, I received an e-mail from him and we swapped a few e-mails for a week or so.  Another year went by and I thought of him and sent him an e-mail.  It came back undeliverable.  His e-mail address was no longer valid.  I worried for a second that something bad might have happened, but felt in my heart that he was okay.  Four years later, I'm performing one of my frequent exorcisms in my bedroom, which consists of going through the stuff I have accumulated and weeding things out.  I found one of my Kylie Greatest Remixes CD's and popped it in the CD player while I worked.  Rod was a huge Kylie fan and I received the CDs about the time I met him.  I thought about him and wondered if he was doing okay.  A week later, I was continuing the exorcism by going through some boxes.  I found some compilation tapes of rare Stock/Aitken/Waterman remixes that I didn't have.  I put them in the stereo and listened to them while I was cleaning house.  Again, I thought of Rod and wondered if he was doing okay.  I thought to myself that I would really like to get hold of him, but had no idea how.  I forgot which town he lived in and had no idea what his last name was.  Tonight, I received an e-mail from someone whose blog I had left a comment on a month or so ago.  I visited his blog and clicked on one of the links on the side of his bar and then clicked on the links on the side of the next blog, etc.  I must have dones this five or six times.  I chose blogs that just had interesting or funny titles.  So I'm reading about this guy's Easter Sunday and I see this thumbnail on the right side of his blog and I realize that one of these teeny tiny guys looks familiar to me.  I clicked on the image and it opens up.  I thought to myself, "That looks like Rod's friend, Kevin."  I dismissed it thinking that I had not seen this guy in years and now some guys who lives on the other coast looks like him.  I scroll down the blog some more and find this image of Kevin with a friend named Rod, which talks about Rod visiting from North Carolina.  Rod's name was a hyperlink so I clicked on it and I'm taken to this Web site where I know immediately this is the same Rod.    I look around his Web site a bit and see that he is in a relationship and doing very well in his career.  He looks very well and I smile because I'm relieved that he is okay.  Then, I sort of think back to all the events of this past week.  First, I think about him just out of the blue for the first time in years.  Then I find the mix tapes he made for me in a box a few days later.  Finally, through a random set of links, I come across a site with a picture of his best friend and a link to his Web site.  I don't mean to imply that it's weird because I think things happen for a reason.  What is the reason?  I have no idea.  Perhaps the purpose is just to let me know that he's doing okay.  I sent him an e-mail to let him know I was glad to see that he was doing well.  I'm not expecting a response or renewed contact.  I received the answer I was looking for.  He's doing great and that is good.  I should be in bed, but I'm just sitting here jazzed at the way the universe works.  At times, things seem to happen like magic.  If only I could apply that magic to other areas of my life or help out other people I know.  It reminds me of when I had the inexplicable urge to drive to Oaklawn Records and Chris was there.  (See the post from April 10th.)  So what do y'all think about this?

       MEANWHILE BACK AT THE RANCH...   As I was eating my lunch, I came across  urlLink Rancho Noho .  It was under my Favorites so I must have collected it on one of my blog safaris. It's the story of Maury, his ex-lover, Patrick, his lesbian mistress and their three-year-old daughter.  The site is divided up between the main house and then separate rooms for each of the four people.  Interesting design.  It's worth a gander.

       MORE DETAILS ON MY DEAD BODY   From the  urlLink Atlanta Journal Constitution .   Police probe death of man on interstate  Police have not determined whether the death of a homeless man whose body was found in a center lane of the Downtown Connecter early Monday morning was a suicide, homicide or accident.   The body of Keith Hudson, 31, was discovered about 5:15 a.m. on the connector just north of West Peachtree Street. Northbound lanes of the connector were shut down until 7:45 a.m.   That's so sad. I wonder what his story is.  Everybody has a story.  He was somebody's son and possibly someone's brother.  I wonder if he had children?  I sometimes wonder what our responsibility is to the homeless people of Atlanta.  Lord, knows we have plenty and tourists complain about being hounded by them downtown.  Many of these people have mental problems that are not severe enough to qualify for the funding to keep them in an institution.  After the holidays, we extracted a man who was living in the Christmas tree birm in Grant Park.  He had his xylophone and a stack of last year's issues of  Creative Loafing .   If I was homeless, I would move somewhere tropical where I could sleep on the beach.  I'd learn how to play the ukelele so that I could sing Bananarama songs on the street corners and people would toss their change into my spiffy little hat.  You never see homeless people dancing in a G-string on a street corner as people put their change into his G-string.  I think that would make more money.   Of course, it would be difficult in the winter.  My friend, Colin, and I used to go to this club called The Wave in Dallas many years ago.  We would stand around and talk about other people.  There was stripper who danced on a box where we liked to stand.  He thought he was really hot and was always trying to get our attention.  We ignored him all the more for it.  I once suggested that we put a dollar with super glue on it into his G-string, but we figured he probably shaved off all of his body hair and wouldn't mind the feeling of pulling some skin off.  I like to think I'm a better person now than I was then.

       RECONSIDERING YOKO ONO OR LOVE AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD   I went over to Troy's  urlLink Sometimes Happy  blog for my daily dose of happiness.  He had a quote from Yoko Ono.  Now, I personally find Yoko to be a bit obscure for my taste, but I generally find that if Troy posts it on his blog it will have some relevance and value.  Ms. Ono was giving a quote about the Consitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and she said the following:  "I find it strange that there should be so much controversy about this issue in a modern society. In these turbulent times, how wonderful it is for anyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, to find love. We should embrace, share, celebrate, and validate that love. Every man has a man who loves him! Every woman has a woman who loves her!"  What a wonderful sentiment and outlook!  Personally, I find this quote to be the most succinct and eloquent statement about the whole issue so far.  It sort of cuts to the chase and reminds people that we live in a time where there are a lot of other more pressing issues that need to be addressed and isn't the miracle of love a wonderful and beautiful thing... no matter who it occurs betweeen?  This begs the question, do we really understand what love is?  Can scientists reproduce it in a laboratory environment?  Can love and the scientific method coexist in perfect harmony?  I'd say no.  Oh yes, sometimes we can predict it like the weather, but how often have we also said there would be snow and rain and found ourselves inundated with sunshine?  Two people see each other.  Their eyes meet, the pulse quickens and they look away from each other.  They become fascinated with one another and have to know everything about that person.  What were they like in the first grade?  What does she think about euthanasia?  Does he foxtrot?  It's all so intoxicating!  No, I think you can make a list of the qualities you want in a potential partner so that you can avoid the people who are unhealthy for you.  You can meet someone who has the qualities of that list, but there still has to be that myseterious, spiritual, chemical reaction that ignites between two people and causes the beaker to fizz over.

       WHEN JOAN CALLS...   Jeff: Did someone come by today that you want to tell me about?  Jef: No.  Jeff: Someone who might have left me a piece of paper.  Jef: Well, if you're hinting at the exterminator, I don't necessarily want to tell you about it.  He rang the doorbell and handed me the bill.  I figured you would know what it was for if I put it in your special mail spot (Dining room table).  Jeff: By the way, Joan called.  So I called Joan. She doesn't answer her telephone anymore because she is being stalked by telemarketers who breathe heavy.  I left a message and she called me back.  We talked for two hours.  I don't know why.  I had things to do, but we talked for two hours.  She confessed that she always thought that I would have enjoyed Justin Timberlake's  Justified  album.  She has already slipped over to the Dark Side.  I"ve never heard it.  I told him that I heard that the JC Chasez album had gotten better reviews. She pronounced his name and it sounded like a Gospell drag queen.  I told her that I was getting e-mails from the Kylie Minogue Mailing List again. They had stopped for about a year.  There are many people who are relieved that has pulled out of  VH1's Divas Las Vegas  show.  Joan heard that Posh and Becks are breaking up because he has been  diddling  another ho.  I told her that was whack!  I've always been fascinated with the obession of the public with those two.  We discussed the fact that Scary Spice is performing in  Rent  on Broadway and Baby Spice has been the most successful of all the Spice Girls.  I mentioned that Brits and Aussies use the word "whilst" a lot and we Americans don't.  I decided to use the word "whilst" whilst i blog each day.  We discussed some personal things about her sister, Marti, but I can't say anything about Marti getting her unmentionables pierced yet.  She will announce it on the  Ramblings of a Redhead  site soon.  We discussed her nephew, Eric, turning 22.  No one seems to know how he celebrated it.  I said that was whack!  We reviewed the list of the top ten celebrity meltdowns on MSN.com.  We laughed at the comments from Mariah Carey, but my favorite meltdown was Whitney Houston.  She's whack!  I commented on how I think it's funny when people blog about their significant other and refer to him/her as baby as a term of endearment.  It seems more natural when people say it than when you read it.  When you're reading along and you see "baby" it just stands out and everyone slows down.  Imagine if you were driving down the highway and everyone slows down because there is this big "baby" in the middle of the road that everyone has to get off the highway and drive around.  That's what it's like.  I don't like to be called baby.  At this point, we both decided it was way too late and we were suffering from sleep deprivation.  I told her to go to  Sometimes Happy  to see the picture of the orca penis.  It's long and tendrilly like an octopus.  I don't care if it needs cleaning, I don't watn to touch it.  That's whack!

       OVER MY DEAD BODY!   Interstate 75 and Interstate 85 merge into one highway as they go through downtown Atlanta.  They are both closed this morning because authorities found a body on the Interstate.  (Is dead body redundant? You never imply that someone has a sexy dead body.  I'll have to genuflect on this.)  I imagine this body in the middle of the highway with a boundry of chalk surrounding it.  Yellow crime tape stretches from one side of the highway to the other.  Detectives in rain coats and fedoras stand around looking pensive while eating donuts.  Japanese tourists wander up from somewhere and smile as the fingerprint brush guy takes their picture in front of the body.  What if they picked it up and began posing with it?  That's horrible!  The other image that comes to mind is that it is a really big body laying across the freeway and preventing traffic from passing. However, since I do not know any 40-foot people, this is most likely impossible.  Oh well, back to work.  Sometimes it's nice to work from home.

       GREEK ORTHODOX GOOD FRIDAY SERVICE   Okay, so Jeff asks me if I'd like to go to a Good Friday service at a Greek Orthodox church.  It seems he has been chomping at the bit to visit this church for a while.  As luck would have it, our friend Ryan attends a Greek Orthodox church and invited us to the Good Friday service.  So we went.  Ryan met us there.  We lit a white taper candle and stuck it in a sandbox near the door of the sanctuary.  I'm not sure why.  I simply followed the herd.  Please note that I am simply reporting what I experienced.  Ryan was sitting on the other side of Jeff so I didn't always hear the explanation of everything.  The church itself was one of the most beautiful churches that I have ever been in.  There were murals of different scenes of Jesus' life on all the walls.  Everyone had that heavy-eyelid look that was popular in Byzantinian art.  [Yes, I received an "A" in Art History 101.]  Jesus looked like Max Von Sydow.  Max played Ming the Merciles in  urlLink Flash Gordon .  Every time I looked up at the murals during the service, I would look at Jesus and hear "Flash!  Ah-ahhhh.  Savior of the universe!"  It was very distracting.  I've noticed that there are many images of Jesus and the disciples looking very happy.  They always look so solemn.  It doesn't seem like very good marketing for a missionary selling the  Good News .  Of course, I suppose Jesus knew what was coming and I could understand seeming a bit non-plussed by that.  It makes you wonder exactly when Jesus knew in his life what his final moments on earth would be like. Did he know from the time he was born or just before he returned to Jerusalem?  There were six doors that separated the front area from an altar.  A different Biblical figure was on each door.  It sort of gave the impression that if you put 75cents into the coin slot, the door would open and you would receive a saint.    In actuality, only the far door on either end was truly functional.  Above these doors were images of the faces of Saints.  It reminded me of an add for a movie where is shows all the movie stars making cameos in a light comedy.  It was just another reminder what a strange little world I live in.  I view everything through pop culture glasses.  My favorite image was of the Madonna with child.  Her arms were at either side as if she was saying, "Ta-duh!"  The baby Jesus stood on her lap looking more like a very small adult who was washed in very hot water and shrunk.  His hand was in the air and his fingers seemed to be forming the peace sign, which of course made me hear Richard Nixon saying, "I've never been a quitter."  It was a very ornamental church.  There were lots of icons as would be expected.  The service was conducted in Greek with some sections in English.  The liturgy was chanted in a very melodic fashion so it was very soothing to listen to.  We sat at times and then stood.  At one point, Ryan pulled out the kneeling tray without warning and almost amputated my foot, but I'm okay.  The hardest part for me was the incense smoker.  My nose is so hyper-sensitive to smoke now that there so few places that smokers can light up, that even the briefest hint of incense can make my sinus cavity quake with fear.  I'll be damned if the clergy didn't come by and swing that incense thingybobber in my face and just missing my nose by a few inches.  After two and a half hours, the congregation lined up to pay their respects to a mat that had the image of Jesus' body that was laid in a mock tomb.  They would pay their respects and kiss it and kiss a Bible too.  Some of the younger children crawled under this structure after they kissed the Jesus mat and Bible.  I presume it was for some blessing or for a good year or something along those lines.    Ryan apologized for the service going so long.  It seems the Bishop always drags the service out and he did not typically come to the 3:00pm service, but he did this time.    All in all, I found it to be a very beautiful service.  I enjoyed watching the faces of the congregants and seeing them emotionally respond to the service.  I've never felt emotionally connected to the church.  Emotions are things that should not be trusted at face value.  It's more important to understand things on an intellectual level.  My relationship with God is personal and their is emotion there, but it something expressed in private and not for all to see.  For a long time, I thought religion was something that everyone else got that I just didn't get.  It was like a joke where everyone else understood, but I didn't.  I didn't see the point of laughing along with everybody else if I didn't think it was funny.  Much of this is due to the fact that I grew up in the Church of Christ, which is a literalist church.  There are no musical instruments in the church service because of a scripture that says make music with your hearts.  I asked Ryan, who doesn't necessarily feel drawn to organized religion, why he comes to this church.  He said it was because it was what felt right or comfortable to him.  It was what he grew up with.  He liked the pagentry and the icons and the incense.  I thought that was interesting and it reflected back how my interpretation of the service was based upon my own religious upbringing and pop culture experiences.  Furthermore, it made me wonder what is more important: the message of Christianity or the style in which it is presented?

       A DIFFERENT KIND OF STUD   For those of you who have never seen oral historian and author,  urlLink Studs Terkel , interviewed, you're missing out.  There is an informative article in Sunday's AJC about him.  In the early 90's, I began interviewing young gay men and women about their experiences for a book I had planned to write entitled  They Walk Among Us .  My purpose was to educate the public that gay and lesbian boys and girls did exist and they were discovering their feelings and their identities much younger than imagined.  It was to allow them a voice to tell their own stories.  No two individuals are alike.  In fact, I remember interviewing a boy in high school and trying to make him understand a question that asked him to identify a psychological rationale behind his sexual actiivity, but ended up feeling like he thought I was just getting turned on by having him tell me about his sex life.  I wonder if there is still merit in such a project?  After working with the historical committee with our neighborhood association and reading two books on the history of gay New York,  it has made me want to document some of the history of gay life in Atlanta.  My friend, Mark, and I talked about interviewing some of our gay elders to put together an Atlanta gay history Web site about a year or two ago.  I should really do something about this.  Our community was so devastated by the aids crisis in the 80's that many voices and stories have been lost forever.  I think I'll put this down on my calender to being doing something with in the Fall.

       BARR STILL AFTER CLINTON   Bob Barr has contributed articles to  urlLink Creative Loafing  that have demonstrated his intelligence and knowledge of law, but his quest to reinstate a defamation suit against Ex-President Clinton undermines that creditibility in my opinion.  Based upon this article from the  urlLink AJC , he may be undermining his credibility with me again.  I'd like to see the facts presented by both sides, but I find it doubtful that Barr will win that 30 million.   WASHINGTON -- Former U.S. Rep.

       MASADA IS MORE THAN A BRAND OF BAGELS   Tonight, I read the Sunday  urlLink AJC .  The Target ad, my main reason for buying the Sunday paper each week, was abysmal.  Best Buy and Circuit City didn't offer much hope either.  I briefly zipped through the comics and found myself face to face with the rest of the paper.  I found myself oddly motivated to read the rest of the paper and to find out what was going on in the rest of the world.    In the Travel section, there was a fascinating article about  urlLink Masada .  Is is the ancient fortress near the Dead Sea where in the first century 960 zealots held off Roman soldiers for over a year before commiting suicide on the eve of their capture.  The event is mentioned nowhere in the Talmud and was basically ignored by Jewish history until archaeologists began to uncover more information at the site during the 1960's.  The zealots were so commited to their spiritual beliefs that they fled Jerusalem during the second revolt against the Romans and retreated to Masada.  They defended themselves and their ideas until they realized there was no escape and that capture was imminent.  More than likely, all the men would be put to death, but the women would most likely be raped and the children turned into slaves.  The men of Masada felt that it would be better to kill their own wives and children than to allow them to fall into the hands of the Romans.  S  ome could argue that women and children were viewed as nothing more than property at that time and that the decision to slay the women and children may not have been for the most alstruistic reasons.  Still, giving the benefit of the doubt, I'm not sure that many of us today believe any a cause so strongly to take such action.  Is there any cause today that would inspire you to lay down your life for your beliefs?  Granted, if any of us were on a plane and  a terrorist attempted to do something, I think we would all stand up now and inform them that we are from the United State of Kick Your Ass.  I cringe at writing that from the perspective that other nations seem to have of Americans and our current attitudes about foreign policy, but what I mean by writing what I did is that the victims of 9/11 had no idea of what was about to happen to them.  We had always been told to cooperate with hijackers to prevent from being hurt.  Look what happened to them?  Now, we believe that any attempt to take control of an aircraft is a threat to every person aboard that flight in addition to anyone else that might come in contact with the plane.  In other words, the responsibility would now fall upon ourselves to take action no matter what country you come from.  All in all, I don't know that I could give my life for many of my beliefs.  Am I going to kill myself to make a point about a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  No.   Do I speak up and say that I think it's wrong to change the most sacred government document to discriminate against some of our country's citizens if it may jeopardize my life?  In that sense, maybe I am willing to risk my life even if the chances are little to none that I will actually be harmed.  I think the Masada story is a good one to read.  To read one rabbi's theory on why this event was let out of the Talmud, read the entry for  urlLink Masada at the Jewish Virtual Library .

       EASTER IN REVIEW   I woke up late this morning.  Please see the previous post for an explanation of why I didn't sleep well last night.  As a result, I didn't make it to the early church service or my  Quest  class.  Although there are quite a few interesting things in the final lesson that I think you will find interesting.  I'll post them later.  I was feeling pretty sluggish today and got dressed with the intention of going to the 10:55am service at Jeff's church here in the neighborhood.  I looked up and realized that I was late. I hate being late and many times will not go if I'm going to be late.  I made that decision today.  Instead, I picked up around the house and my friend, Tim, called from North Carolina.  In fact, I need to post separately about Tim.  He is a character that deserves many separate posts.  Jeff and I went drove down to his parents house for Easter dinner.  We ate about 2:00pm.  The weather was overcast, but it was a pretty day today.  We had a nice meal and I spent most of the afternoon outside with Jeff's great nephew blowing bubbles.  We were going great guns with bubbles until the great nephew decided that he wanted to hold the bottle.  The next thing I knew, I was sitting in the bubble mixture.  So much for bubbles!  I dyed eggs the night before so we could hide them.  I was most impressed with the chartreuse eggs.  When I was kid, we had four colors: red; blue; yellow; and I believe orange.  I'm not sure why we had an orange tablet since it is a secondary color and yet we had to use blue and yellow dyes to make green.  In the egg dye kit that I bought this year, it came with nine tablets in various colors including the aforementioned chartreuse.    I hid the eggs and the great nephew hunted for them.  He would squeal with delight whenever he found one.  Of course, this is expected when you are two-years-old.  I wondered what my co-workers would think if one day I just squealed like a big ol' girl when my Good Faith Estimate (GFE) matches my settlement statement.  Does the increase in testosterone production supress the desire and ability to scream like a big ol' girl as boys grow into men or do we learn to change our behavior to what is expected of us?  I'm not sure.  In truth, I'm not really interested in screaming like a big ol' girl anyway, but I like to have my options left open to me.  What guy doesn't?  Jeff's parents gave me a small Easter basket.  I'm officially the adopted son.  It even had a Cadbury egg in it, which is my favorite alongside those Brach chocolate marshmallow bunnies.  I must confess that I have not eaten as I normally do over this past weekend.  It's a holiday.  We make exceptions.  I stretched out on my bed to read the Sunday paper this evening.  Buddy, the cat, decided to join me.  As usual, she tried to make it all about her and wanted me to rub her and pet for the next 20 years.  After ten minutes of reading and petting, I felt drowsy and began to drift off to sleep.  Suddenly, a sharp little paw taps me on my lower lip.  I bolted up right, which caught her claw and punctured my lip.  She was just trying to get my attention, but OUCH!  "Don't do that!" I shouted.  She just looked up at me as if I were some crazy, illogical pet owner.    I napped for an hour and then got up and Jeff and I had a sandwich for dinner.  I called my parents and now I'm updating the blog.  I had wanted to organize my desk this weekend, but instead I worked on my bedroom and the rest of the house.  Where has the weekend gone?  I'm reflecting back upon Easter.  It's not one of my favorite holidays, but I like the symbolism of Easter.  It's about overcoming adversity and succeeding against the odds.  It's about rebirth, renewal and rededication.  I've been giving a lot of thought to those things and how to apply that to my life.  One of the goals that I set this year was to mentally go through my day and forgive anyone I need to forgive or release anything I need to release from the day.  Sometimes the person I need to forgive most is me.  It's not about someone being right or wrong.  It's about having my energy and emotional energy tied up and invested in a particular situation or with a particular person.  As a result, I find my resources compromised because I'm stuck in this situation.  If I can forgive and release the person/situation, then I have all of my resources at my disposal.  It may sound corny, but I find it works for me.  Afterwards, I meditate for about ten minutes before I go to bed.  I haven't been consistent with this and I have made the decision to do this every night at 10:00pm to ensure that it's done.  It's a fresh start with me.  Looking at your own life, is there any area of your life that you would like a fresh start with?

       JEF VS. ACID REFLUX   Last night Jeff and I went to Uncle Julio's for dinner.  I was craving sour cream chicken enchiladas in a bad way and they were delicious.  We ate late and I'm not used to eating that kind of food on a daily basis.  Last night I dreamt that I wrote a musical play about two pioneer women who fall in love with the same mad scientist.  I was amazed that I had written these songs that these women sang. The melodies were so beautiful and I had never heard them before.  How can we create original music in our dreams and be unable to remember them after we wake up?    Anyway, I was enjoying the show when I suddenly found myself on all fours in my bed with vomit coming out of my nostrils.  It wasn't a lot, but I was startled and my nostrils were burning from the acid in my stomach.  I went to the bathroom and washed my face, blew my nose and brushed my teeth again.  It took me quite a while to get back to sleep.  I spoke with my parents tonight.  Both my parents have acid reflux from time to time.  I told them what happened.  They both asked me if I ate late and had a heavy or greasy meal.  I sheepishly admitted that I had.  I spoke with them both separately and they both informed me that the other parent had a problem with acid reflux from time to time.  I had to laugh.  Neither one spoke of their own problems with acid reflux but mentioned the problems of the other parent.  I've always had a very acidy stomach.  As a small child, I couldn't tolerate orange juice very well.  It seemed to burn my stomach.  All throughout my life I've had moments where acid from my stomach seems to take the express elevator up my throat.  It doen's happen frequently, but from time to time.  I guess I have found another  special  aspect of who I am.  I'll also be careful to eat that type of meal so late in the evening.

       NUMBERS IN MY HEAD   I just realized that my first roommate's birthday is today.  I'm not exactly sure where Chris is now, but I believe he turns 34 today and I wish him all the best.  We lived together for four years and we used to make birthdays something really special.  Whether it was a Bart Simpson T-shirt when The Simpson had just premiered the previous Fall or kidnapping me to take me to a comedy club.  We had fun.  Some Saturday mornings, we wake up early and travel to every Half Price Books in the Metroplex to look for 12" records and promo CD's.  We loved a good remix!  Somewhere along the way, I introduced Chris to Donna Summer and ABBA.  Soon, Chris would play little else and it was many years before I could tolerate hearing Dancing Queen again.    When Chris and I first met, we both had best friends that had left the city earlier that year.  I think we were both lonely in a way that guys are when they miss a male best friend.  We made a pact that we would always be there for each other.  Unfortunately, there was also enough mutual attraction to get us into bed together, but not enough of what we needed to make a healthy romantic relationship.  I guess that I brought Chris out and it was strange to watch how he evolved from gay people approaching him making him shiver in terror to bursting out of closet and yelling, "FLAME ON"  He truly became the Human Torch for a time.  Sadly, we were too much in each others pockets to allow one another to move on.  It was just as much me as him.  We did the best with what we knew at the time.  I remember a moment between the two of us where I couldn't tell whether either one of us was giving because we wanted to or giving out of obligation and that's when I knew we both needed to go our separate ways for now.  The last six months we lived together were in silence.  I think he may have been angry with me when I said I was leaving.  He may have thought I was deserting him, but he needed to more room in his life for a new boyfriend and I needed more room to find myself first and then perhaps a new boyfriend.  I knew the greatest gift I could give him was to let him go and allow myself to walk away.  It was painful and it was scary, but I did it because it was the best thing for both of us.  A month after I moved out, I was surprised to realize one day that all the pain and anger and frustration that I once had vanished.  When I thought of Chris, I remembered us laughing and having a good time.  Some time later that summer, I was driving to the post office on Oak Lawn.  I suddenly had a very strong feeling that I should go to Oak Lawn Records with an urgency that is usually reserved for imminent vomiting.  I had no need or desire to go to Oak Lawn Records because I had been there recently, but I had been reading about intuition at the time so I decided to honor the feeling so to speak.  When I walked into the record store, I founnd Chris.  He smiled sheepishly at me and I said hello.  We exchanged some pleasantries.  I was surprised at how easy it was for me and how awkward it seemed for Chris.  I felt like I should try to put his mind at ease.   He was quiet for a moment and said something to affect of I'm sorry for the way things happened.  I smiled and told him not to worry about it.  I let him know that I didn't have any negative feelings toward him.  I think we exchanged phone numbers because I talked to him on the phone some time later.    I'm pretty sure that I must have called.  I wanted for us to be friends again to some degree, but I was wise enough to know that there would be some differences.  I knew it was not healthy for us to spend a lot of time together, but if we could go to lunch once a month or so I would have been pleased.  I wanted to stay in touch, but I didn't want to hold a lot of influence over his decisions now.  He had a boyfriend now and I wanted him to turn to his boyfriend for that type of support.  The conversation was awkward and I felt that there was some heavy burden of guilt that Chris carried for the time we lived together.  There was no logical reason for it, but when have emotions been logical.  After speaking for about 15 minutes, I knew that we could not renew our friendship at that time.  I hung up the phone and said a little prayer for him and wished him the best.  I needed to focus on working out my own issues and problems and not try to fix everyone else.  This was the new me with lemon-freshened borax!   I ran into Chris occasionally when I ran into him while I was out at J.R.'s or Moby Dick's.  I was with my new friends that he didn't know and he was with his own friends that I didnt' know.  We would say hello.  Occasionally, we might make the attempt to initiate a stiff hug.  Eventually, I moved to Atlanta.  Many years later, I was home for Christmas and I Kent and I drove to Dallas to meet his new boyfriend, Blaise.  We went to dinner and came back to the house where Blaise was renting a room from Stevie.  In walks Chris.  It turns out that Stevie and Chris are friends.  We smiled and said hello awkwardly.  At this point, I just felt uncomfortable being around Chris at all because I felt like I made him so uncomfortable.  Here I was basically invading his territory.  He asked me about life in Atlanta and my boyfriend.  I asked him a bit about his.  Then, Blaise, Kent and I left.  Last time I heard, Chris had been through the Saturn Retrograde where you lots of life-challenging events occur when Saturn returns to where it was in the heavens when you were born.  This usually happens when you are 28 or 29.  I don't normally put much stock in astrology, but I can assure you that this happened to me.  In fact, I'm not looking forward to age 56 with much anticipation.  Chris and Stevie had a falling out and now they have renewed their friendship.  I'm glad about that because Stevie is really great guy who is a fantastic friend to Chris.  Sometimes people come into your life and they stay a lifetime.  Some people just come into your life to walk with you for awhile and then your individual paths take you in different directions. I don't measure the success of a relationship, be it romantic or platonic, based upon the time you spent together.  I base the quality of the relationship on what I learned with that person.  I went through some of the most difficult life lessons I have experienced with Chris.  At the time, I thought he was responsible for some of my unhappiness.  In retrospect, he was a patient teacher.  I hope I was the same for him.  I wouldn't give up those experiences for anything in the world because they made me who I am today and I really like who I am today.  Happy birthday, Chris, and I hope you have the best day ever!  As I come to the end of this post, I realize that I meandered severely off topic.  The purpose of this post was the way that some dates remain permanently etched onto our brains for life while we cannot remember others at all.  For example, I remember birthdays of people that I was very close to in my mid 20's, but I have difficulty remembering anyone else's birthday.  I can remember birthdays for Susan, Chris, Kent and Joan without breaking a sweat, but I cannot remember the birthdays of some of my closest friends from high school as my friend, Duane, demonstrated last Sunday when he called on his birthday.  The human mind is strange and funny thing.

       FEEL MORE JOY   Someone once gave me a little book by Shakti Gawain entitled Reflections In The Light: Daily Thoughts And Affirmations.  I try to read a passage every morning to put myself in the right frame of mind for the day.  I found today's entry unusual until I actually started to think about it.  I'll share it with you.   Feel more joy  Saness is related to the opening of your heart.  If you allow yourself to feel sad, especially if you can cry, you will find that your heart opens wider and you can feel more love and more joy.  *  As I allow myself to feel my sadness, I open to more joy.   *

       A NIGHT AT THE BIG TOP   Yesterday was a strange day.  As hard as I worked, I felt like I was just running in place and didn't seem to be moving ahead.  I had some new marketing ideas that I feel good about, but it's probably best not to try to implement them on Good Friday since you never know who is open and closed for business.  In addition, I have a full list of things I can do today and I have already been up early taking care of one of them at a time.  Sometimes I have to remind myself to break things down into steps and take it one step at a time.  I can be my own worst enemey at times, but I'm learning how to be my own best friend too.  Jeff reminded me that we had tickets to go see Alegria at  urlLink Cirque Du Soleil  last night.  I have been so focused on work, volunteer stuff and the Perfect Pitch contest this week that I had completely forgotten about it.  This was about the time some work-related events came to a head and I just had to sit down and center myself.  I just had to ask myself why I was really getting upset because it was not about what I initially thought it was about.  After a few minutes, I figured it out and regained my sense of peace.  Shortly after, I received an e-mail from  urlLink Image  tha the Perfect Pitch contest deadline had been extended from April 9th to April 23rd.  That was a relief.   About 6:00pm, we drove up to Smyrna, which is just north of Atlanta.  We had a nice dinner at  urlLink Red Lobster .  I ate a cheese biscuit and FRIED shrimp.  I'm sure some of you thought that the earth would go spinning off its axis if I ate something UNHEALTHY.  Well, I lived and we are still in orbit around the sun.  It looks like the coast is clear.  It was amazing to see these huge tents along side the highway near the Galleria.  It looked like someone had inflated a Renaissance festival.  We walked into the gates and Jeff decided that I should have a souvenir program.  I stopped and was waiting for him to come back when a group of older gay men appeared.  They looked at me for a moment and they saw Jeff come back with the program and hand it to me and they just smiled and wend, "Awww...."  I know it sounds cheesy, but it was really a sweet moment.  I have an obsessive fear of not using the restroom before any performance.  Going to see  The Return Of The King  was very nerve-racking because I didn't drink anything for 24-hours prior to the movie so I could make it through without a mandatory intermission.  So I walk up to one of the latrines and open the door and there is a guy standing there coiling his equipment back up into his jeans.  I was very embarrassed even though the door said that it was vacant.  The guy laughed and was cool about it.  I think he may have been an exhibitionist.  The set was very impressive.  There were clowns in thse 18th Century masks walking around.  The show is a combination of music and gymnastics.  One woman did an impressive trapeze act.  There was a fantastic juggler who looked like Helena Bonham-Carter in the face.  One fellow did a hand-balancing act that was awesome.  There were acrobats that did flips and landed on these soft boards and some guys who did something on a swing of sorts above the audience.  I had never seen it before.  It was impressive, but I would not have made it the finale.  The contorionist was pretty awesome with her hula hoops.  At times, I couldn't tell if I was looking at her from the front or back because she was literally a human pretzel.  The flying man performed some aerial skills on sort of a bungee wire.  I looked up several times at Jeff and he was so excited to share this with me that it made even more special.  He asked me what my favorite part of the show was.  It was hard to say.  The contortionist and the hand-balancing act were technically amazing, but I really wanted to do the flying man's job.  Afterwards, we went by urlLink  Steak & Shake  and bought chocolate shakes.  (Will the madness never end?!)  There was a couple there that were being very affectionate.  The looked like brother and sister so it reminded me of John Irving's Hotel New Hampshire.  It was a very nice end to a so-so day.

       EMOTIONAL QUICKSAND   You know how you are just cruising along fine and something happens that just seems to suck you into a black funkin' hole where all hope, happiness and light has been condensed into blackness?  Well that happened to me this afternoon.  I sat down, sighed, took a deep breath and just allowed myself to feel it.  My mind, like a playful puppy, saw the door wide open and ran for it with full abandon.  I sat calmly as I watched my imagination run away with every absolute worst scenario and then when it wore itself out and was standing outside the door, I opened it and asked, "Are you through now?"  It barked and came back inside and everything calmed again.   I know there is a reason for everything happening in my life right now and I'm talking about much more good than, well nothing bad really, but I'll call the things "preferably nots."  I sat down at 5:30pm and finished Carrie Fisher's book,  The Best Awful .  I enjoyed it.  It was a sequel to  Postcards From The Edge .  I liked this one better.  There was a line on the last page that struck a chord with me and I think I will share it in this little space because I really like you:   And when they asked her if she was happy, this time she'd answer, "Among other things."

       WAXING ON ABOUT THE FEMALE BREAST    "Do feel any different now that you're older?"  "OH YES!"  "Like what?"  "I can't go out all night and then survive a full work day on 15-minutes of sleep."  "Point taken."  "And my boobs aren't as pretty anymore."  "What do you mean?"  She paused for a moment.  "They're just not the same anymore."  "Do you mean their sagging?"  "DOH!  YOU SAID IT!  Now they will sag more."  "I doubt very much that my spoken word has made your boobage advance any further down than where they are now.  If it was true, I could just say, 'Do you mean they're sagging?' seven times fast and they'd be dragging the floor now."  "They point south now."  "I beg your pardon?"  "They point south now.  My nipples...."  "Oh."  "If I ever had any additional income to throw away on cosmetic surgery, I would have my breasts reduced and the nipples repositioned."  "My friend, Laurie, from high school had a breast reduction surgery because of her back.  They had to cut her nipples off and reposition them on her breast.  The feeling didn't return for sxi months."  "Owie!"  " I guess that makes sense.  Otherwise your boobs would be cross-eyed, wouldn't they.  They could be very distracting for any potential sex partner.  It might seem like your boobs aren't paying attention during lovemaking and cause him to lose his enthusiasm."  We were quite for a moment.  "Well, I guess I'd better run and get back to work."  Yeah, I need to take a shower.  Let's talk about breasts again sometime."  "Okay."

       A PASSIONATE CONVERSATION   Joan and I went to lunch yesterday afternoon.  During a burrito at  urlLink Moe's , we had the following conversation.   "Do you have any desire to see urlLink  The Passion of the Christ ?" I asked.  "Yes... and no."  "What do you mean?"  "I'd like to, but I'm afraid that I wouldn't be able to watch all the violence.  I had to turn  Saving Private Ryan  off."  "Jeff's sister walked out of  Private Ryan  during the opening batttle becaue she got sick, but she said didn't have a problem with  The Passion .  She said it was easier for her because she knew that what she was seeing was actually close to what happened to Jesus."  "Do you have any desire to see it?"  I paused a moment.  "No, I think I have a good understanding of what happened intellectually and my spirit doesn't feel the need to go see this movie in an effort to understand it emotionally.  I guess it's my Church of Christ background.  You know what chilly literalits they are."  There was much chewing on burritos and ideals for a moment.  "Joan, do you know if Jim Caviezel gets naked in this movie?"  "Why would he have a nude scene?"  "The Roman soldiers did strip him and beat him, I just wondered if it depicted that."  "Do you find Jim Caviezel attractive?"  "Oh yeah!"  "So you will go see a movie that displays the ee-hee (Joanese for penis) of Christ for the "woo woo" factor, but you won't go see the movie to be moved by the most significant event that has ever happened."  "You make it sound so... so... dirty."  "You're reducing Jesus Christ to a sex symbol!"  "No, I'm not.  I just asked if Jim Caviezel did a nude scene.  That's all.  Even if he's doing full-frontal, it's still not going to get me into a theatre.  I just wondered how commited an actor was to his part and the director to the authenticity of his interpretation.  It is rated R after all.  Besides, I would never see it as Jesus' penis it would be Jim Caviezel's penis and it would not be in it's full glory while he's being beaten.  You're confusing  The Passion  with  Pledgemaster IV: The Final Paddle ."  "Okay, I believe you."  "I bet Merrideth would go see it just to see Jim Caviezel naked."  "You're probably right.  She does like hirsute fellows with long flowing locks and facial hair."  "Would you like some more Diet Coke?"  "Yes, I would.  Thank you."

       MOTH BALL DIARIES, ENTRY 2   Katy, Kellie, Chris, Jeff (not 2F's) and I met at Grant Central West to discuss this year's Moth Ball.  I had called Katy to confirm where we were meeting as I got into the Miata, having just received a hair cut.  As fate would have it, George, her husband, had kid duty and informed me that he would pass the phone on to Katy who was just stepping out of the shower.  There's nothing like talking to someone on the phone who you know is naked.  Personally, I felt that this was way too early in the planning stages for us to talk on the phone naked.  In my mind, mid-summer should be the sufficient amount of time required to talk on the phone in the nude.  I figured by July that Katy, Kellie and I would be having three-ways in the buff all the time with the help of Southern Bell.    Chris is the President of the Grant Park Neighborhood Association (GPNA) and Jeff is the V.P.  It was hard to hear on my end of the table with the ambient noise.  I watched Chris as he spoke, but there was no soundtrack for a good portion of the time.  I found myself wondering what Chris would look like in drag and wondering, "Do we have a potential Queen of the Moth Ball contestant here?"    We received confirmation that we will have the tent at the Zoo Atlanta for the same Saturday as the Tour of Homes.  In order to do more with the party, we're going to make the event a fundraiser.  Katy suggested that we give the money to the Grant Park Conservancy (GPC) and I suggested that we give it specifically for the restoration of the fountains in the park since our study revealed that it will cost $300,000 to get just one working.  That's a lot of brownies and bundt cakes for a bake sale approach.  Plus, it's something tangible that people have been talking about lately.  I'm concerned that Glenn may actually show up one day with a chisel and a hammer to try and fix it himself.  I asked them if there were some other things we could offer at the Moth Ball that we could charge for in addition to the ticket.  It would allow us  to raise more money for the fountains.  They asked for an example and all I could think of was lap dances.  Chris and Jeff seemed intrigued by the idea, but Katy and Kellie were having problems visualizing it.  Maybe the Queen of the Moth Ball could offer the lap dances?  Kellie suggested having a photographer with and old camera with a long lens.  She may be on to something.  Things ended with Katy and I disagreeing on exactly what symptoms designated whether someone was a midget or a dwarf.  It was my understanding that the term midget referred to someone who was small in stature, but their limbs were in proportion to the rest of their body, where as a dwarf was not.  The politically  correct term for both now being  little people .  Upon returning home, I found an e-mail from Katy with the answer.  Come to find out, we were both right.  Here is the information straight from the official Web site of  urlLink Little People of America .  I only hope that Katy wasn't so outraged when I challenged her that she had to rush home and access the Internet to resolve the question once and for all.  She's a saucy wench.  I like that in a woman.

       REMEMBERING THE RABBIT TEST AT EASTER TIME   I'm not a big fan of Easter other than I enjoyed seeing my family when I still lived in Texas.  When you're younger, the Easter egg hunts are a nice diversion, but ultimately I think they have led to my obsessive compulsive collective disorder of owning the full set of everything.  If I buy one of something in a series, I must own every other one as well.  If I find a CD I like by a certain band, I must immediately collect every other album they have released.  Alone and glassy-eyed, I cruise the pages of eBay like a shark along a sandbar at dusk.  This has led to my quest to own every Bananarama record in existence.  But honestly, do I really need a picture disc of Do Not Disturb in the shape of Siobhan?  Of course I do!   Let me just say that I don't like peeps.  They are little marshmallow treats in the shape of baby chickens and coated with a light coating of yellow sugar.  They also come in the shape of pink bunnies too.  My mother would buy this for us every year until my older sister and I were well into our 20's.  I'd eat one or two for nostalgia's sake, but inevevitably they would find a home on top of the microwave and or in a drawer and become a painful reminder of another piece of unfinished business that I refused to complete.  I couldn't just throw them out because that would be a reflection on the love for my mother, but I just couldn't eat them.  I could not longer continue to eat the past.  This made me question why the mascot for the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a rodent, smartly dressed in a bow tie and tailored jacket who lives to hide brightly colored hard-boiled eggs for children all over the world.  Is this rabbit a vegetarian?  Where is he getting all of these eggs.  My guess is that he has a sweat shop full of chickens in Asia and somehow Kathy Lee is connected to it all.  Bunnies have never been associated with the ability to rise from the ashes to reinvent themselves.  To me, it would seem more appropriate to have an Easter Phoenix or an Easter Madonna (Ciccone).  At least with Madonna, there is more than one connection.  This made me think of a movie from the 70's with Billy Crystal and written by Joan Rivers.  He was the first man to become pregnant and the title was  Rabbit Test .  When I was young, the rabbit test was still used to determine if a woman was pregnant. She would give a urine sample to the doctor and it would be injected into a female rabbit. When a woman is pregnant, she produces a hormone in her urine, which affects the ovaries in a female rabbit. In the movies, they used to say the rabbit had died to indicate that a woman was pregnant. In actuality, they only killed the rabbits in the early 20's because they had no other way to check the rabbits' ovaries. In time, physicians learned how to inspect the ovaries without killing the rabbit.  At one time, female bunnies were slaughtered for no other reason, but to indicate that a woman had a bun(ny) in the oven.  Jesus was crucified on trumped up charges.  I'm beginning to see a similarity.  Now the bunnies have been saved and we can look at their ovaries without doing them in.  In doing so, we are able to determine if a woman is about to give life to a new human being.  Likewise, Easter is a celebration of Jesus' triumph over death to have everlasting life.  The symbolism is intriguing.  This Easter, I will go to church and then have lunch with Jeff's family.  I am the adopted son they never had. We'll enjoy good food and good company.  We'll hide the eggs for the kids and watch them hunt.  Afterwards, we'll come back and I'll foolishly say that this year I'm actually going to watch The Ten Commandments on TV knowing full well that I cannot invest such a large amount of time in watching TV when I could be doing something productive.  It should be a nice, quiet day.  However, if someone offers me a Jesus peep, I may have to hurt someone.

       WHAT THE BLOG?!   I was reading a new blog by a guy in Australia.  He lives in Canberra, the Capitol as a matter of fact.  When we were planning our trip down under a few years ago, our travel agent tried to talk us out of going to ACT.  "No one ever goes there," she said.  "But we want to and we're paying your salary. Capiche?"  She looked at me spitefully over her bifocals and said, "Kuh-peesh."  Two of my friends in our party worked in state government and the other friend was also very interested in politics.  I was simply along for the ride because I got to see the Twelve Apostles off the coast outside of Melbourne.  Once we arrived in Canberra, I enjoyed it tremendously.  There are many great museums that I wished we had been able to see, but alas, we were only there for a day and a half.  I've been surfing around and trying to understand what attracts me to a blog.  I like to click on the Home Page links when reading Halo Scan comments and check out other blogs.  Some immediately capture my attention and others don't.  I check back with some from time to time and occasionally grow into them.  I'll most likely review the ones I have on my blog and and put some new ones up that I'd like to recommend.  I like  urlLink Belle De Jour  because she sometimes writes about very common things in a fresh way.  I enjoyed her story about going to visit her friend's mother and and the ghosts of the children.  I also like the way she ends some of her posts with a twist or foreshadowing of things to come.  I like  urlLink Sometimes Happy  because you never know what Troy is going to write about and he has a pretty diverse group of readers commenting on his site.  I usually find some interesting new blogs to read by clicking on that Home Page link under the Halo Scan comments.  There is a vulnerability in his posts that I think any reader can relate to, but he holds back just enough to remain mysterious and you want to read more.  I don't think it's manipulation.  I think it's what he is comfortable with for now.  It's like every day is a perfect little pop song.  I like  urlLink Beastmomma    urlLink Not Enough Drew In The Worl d was one of the first blogs that I found on my own.  He has a Walter Mitty quality about his writing that makes me check in from time to time.  His life has had some interesting ups and downs over the past few months and I've enjoyed watching him overcome it all.  He has shared some of his playwriting on his blog, which is very good.  In fact, I must remember to e-mail him to let him know I found two short screenplays that take place in elevators that I wrote several years ago.  It was for my screenwriters group.  It's always an adventure to check in and see what personality he has taken on for today's adventure as I eat my morning yogurt.  If you want to read about a night out with the scoobies, Drew's your man.   urlLink To Blog Or Not To Blog  has been a refreshing read over the past few days.  First, it's nice to read about straight people at times.  I don't want to get stuck in a little, pink, gay ghetto.  Mick, that's his name, rants about a lot of things: Easter; DVD catalogues; Kurt Cobain's suicide; lack of rain; and politics.  Today he was even kind enough to explain to me why Primeminister John Howard is a wanker.  He's also one of those rare people who can use the word fuck a lot in his writing and it doesn't seem out of place.  If you want a change of pace, check out the family man from down under.  What is it that makes us peek into the daily lives of other people?  It is the accessibility of other people across the country, the ocean or the globe?  Do we actually begin caring about the well being of these people we have never met before?  Are we stimulated by what captures their attention that day?  Do we learn and grow from their own experiences expotentially?  I don't know, but it's very addictive to pop over to see what spin Adam has put on the latest political development on  urlLink The C-Blog  or see if Marti is talking to cats again or uncovering a secret world of desktop items at  urlLink Ramblings Of A Redhead .  For now, I don't think I'm hurting myself or anyone else, so I'll continue to do it until I need glasses.

       KENT VS. CONNIE CHUNG   I was thinking about Kent tonight as I was doing some ironing.  Things seem to come out of nowhere when I'm doing repetitive tasks.  Kent was my best friend from the time I was 13 up until he died on January 2, 2001.  I won't go into detail about his death at this time.  That's a post for another day.  In the Spring of '95 I lived in the River Oaks complex on Cedar Springs in a third floor condo that faced the woods in the back.  It was secluded and overlooked a little stream and a wooded area.  It was a nice respite from the city.  Donald had just moved in with a friend who owned a house and traveled quite a bit.  He wanted someone to watch the house while he was gone.  Duane was living with us and pursuing a personal training career at Bally's on Turtle Creek.  This was after his career as a go-go boy at Damewoodz next to J.R.'s and B.M. (Before Maggie).  Kent had been diagnosed not only with hiv in January of '93, but full-blown aids.  I had already seen him go from the person I knew to an emaciated skeleton in a hospital bed and now his meds had caused him to gain some extra weight.  Duane and I invited him to move in with us so that he could be close to the aids resource center in Dallas and some other day programs for people with aids.   At this point in our friendship, Kent had already shut me out and let me back into his life once or twice.  I imagine it was his way of dealing with disease.  It was his protection, but all I knew was that it had hurt me and I didn't understand.  Kent and I had usually seen each other every day or at least talked every day up until that time.  We were so close, people often thought we were together, but we had never crossed that line.  It would have been incestuous.    One day I came home from work and found Kent laying in the hallway half-way in a closet reading old  People  magazines.  "What are you doing down there?"  "Well, I got tired and had to sit down and I was too weak to get back up so I thought I'd clean out this closet.  Did you know what Charles did to Princess Diana when they were still together?"  "Why didn't you call me at work?"  "I couldn't reach the phone.  Anyway, Charles was seeing Camilla the whole time."  I felt awful.  My best friend was stranded in the hallway of our home for several hours and unable to get up.  One day we were sitting on the couch.  Kent was watching television and I was reading the Dallas Voice or something like it.  A commercial for a program featuring Connie Chung came on and Kent said, "I fucking hate Connie Chung."  Silence followed.  I looked over at the top of the newspaper at Kent.  He had a content look on his face and sipped his soup as he watched a rerun of the  Golden Girls .  It wasn't unusual for Kent to explode in a rage over some injustice and then be over it in a moment's notice.  I decided to let the moment pass without further questioning.  However, now when I look back, I wonder what Connie Chung ever do to Kent.  I guess I'll never know.

       SO YOU SAY YOU WANNA WRITE   Tonight my writers group met at Outwrite, a local book store and coffee house.  It's always interesting to meet there because when you read your work, it's sort of like playing strip poker and you have to reveal an article of clothing.  There are people at people around us at other tables. They are flirting with one another, reading books or magazines, playing on their laptops and possibly listening to us reading our writing.  Perhaps there are two people at this WiFi location who may even be chatting with one another on their laptops who are oblivious to the fact that they are only a few feet apart.    T. is about to submit some of his work to a radio program.  He wrote a very creative gate opener that I believe will bring him to the attention of the producer.  It was clever, funny and written well.  What else is there to consider?  Then we begin exploring the idea of whether it is achieving its purpose and we begin to move things around and offer possibilties.  Does it really give enough background information about him without becoming too much of a regular bio?  I gave copies of "Exfoliation" with the understanding that it could be read outside of the meeting and read the Ten Years After The Honeymoon that I posted here back around March 27th.  I'm still curious about where this story came from and why I wrote it.  Some of the feedback I received was that they wanted to see more hints at struggles in the relationship in the past before they finally reach this point of understanding something deeper in their relationship.  How come I don't describe the woman?  Is it because I am a gay man?  I don't feel that was necessarily the reason.  It probably has more to do with the fact that I told the story from her perspective, but that's an interesting thought to consider.  Some of the dialogue seems too literate.  No one talks that way.  Actually, I'm one of those people who does talk that way and that can be a disadvantage when it comes to writing dialouge.  I have never been a good measuring stick when it comes to exemplifying something typical.  I received a compliment about the subtlety and texture in my writing as well as the detail.  All in all, the comments were helpful, but I need to decide what I want to do with this story.  I could disregard it and think of it as simply an exercise, but emotionally, I find that I am somehow connected to these people.  I want to return to them, but it will have to wait another week or so.  I'm really enjoying C.'s work.  Last month was his first meeting.  His stories are about people and situations that are very unusual.  I don't think he realizes how good his writing is. I also suspect it's going to get even better.  There were a lot of people at Outwrite tonight, especially a lot of younger guys with laptops and journals.  I wondered if they were writers.  If so, how come they were not part of our group.  Still, I enojy the intimacty of our small group, but I would like for the maximum number of people to benefit from it.  I think the boy behind C. was flirting with me, but I just assumed that he was trying to get the attention of someone behind me.  I think my indifference may have hurt his feelings.  It's much easier to blame it on the person behind me no matter who he was smiling and making eyes at.  It's interesting to see how the three of us look at things so differently.  Our topics are so different.  Our strengths and weaknesses are different.  I've begun to realize that I'm lazy.  I don't want to go back and reread my work after I'm done.  After I've purged, I want to leave it alone for awhile.  I'm horrible with typos.  I'm going to work on that this month. I've also noticed that I'm more interested in telling the story than I am in the language of writing.  In some ways that can be good and in other ways it can be bad.  There are also times where you realize you've written some lovely prose, but it does not add anything to the piece and you need to cut it.  Ouch!  That hurts.  After T. left, C. and I stayed for a few minutes and talked some more.  He said some things that I thought were interesting, but because I did not ask if I could share those comments, I will refrain from doing so.  The most important thought that came to me from our conversation is that although we all would like to be published and write full-time and earn a comfortable living, I find that I write to connect with other people.  The success of my story or essay is to connect with someone emotionally, intellectually and perhaps even sexually in some instances.  The person could be in my living room or on the other side of the world.  The fact is that my characters and their situation had an affect on someone, however small, and perhaps changed them in some way.  Even if it is just to open their mind to the possibility of that the character may have the right to make choices that the reader does not personally agree with.  I want it to be real on some level and have it resonate and connect.  Isn't that why we write our blogs?  Don't we want to share something of ourselves and establish a rapport with others who relate to what we are communicating.  Through a keyboard and some ASCII characters, we make ourselves vulnerable in a safe way.  We strip and bear ourselves naked to the scrutiny of anyone that finds our little URL.  No matter whether we are making fun of something or being sincere, we reveal information about ourselves with every keystroke.  It's like autoerotic asphyxia.  We take ourselves to the edge of no return and then stop before we black out and die.  We create our tribe.

       WHAT MY SOUTH MEANS TO ME   On my way home from my writers group meeting, I passed a MARTA bus with a a banner on the side.  The banner showed a guy's face and explained that his South was about where jazz was born and a few other things.  It got me thinking about what the South means to me.  It's sweet tea, a Southern drawl, y'all, opening doors for ladies, driving everywhere, deep fried everything, Rebel flags and the rednecks that go with them, cowboy hats, and the proper way to say pecan [puh-kahn].  Looking back, I'm not impressed with my list.  Have I left out loyalty and good neighbors?  I don't know what's missing, but my list is not complete.  I also imagined interviewing different people about what the South means to them.  For some reason I imagined a very masucline lesbian with bleached, spikey hair, quite a bit overweight, smoking on a bar stool and doing shots of tequila.  She tells me her South is between her legs and no man ever gets in there.  I picture a little castle around her vagina with little men storming the castle with battering rams and trying to cross her moat.  Alas, it is for naught.  She goes on to tell about soft Georgia breezes blowing through her pubic hair and the sweetness of the morning dew between her legs.  At this point, I'm beginning to question why I want this character in my head and where she came from.  I understand the sincerity of what she is trying to say, but she has taken a question about home and turned it into a self-examination of her sensuality, if not her sexuality.  Of course, I'm assuming that she was born and/or raised in the South.  Perhaps she was born and bred elsewhere and her response is a passive agressive answer ripe with hostility.  Maybe she struggled with her sexuality and has fianlly embraced the wonders of her body and she is just declaring this freedom in her words.  The question still begs, what is she doing in my head?  I've been very earthy as of late and I'm not sure why.  I'm not sexually frustrated so I don't know where this is coming from.  I guess time will tell.  What does the South mean to you?  Comment if you like.

       PAYING RESPECTS TO REALTORS    One of the first things you will hear mortgage brokers talk about as a negative of the business is that you have to work with realtors.  I found this pretty harsh at first.  Then I went out to meet some realtors and I learned what they were talking about.  Some of these people were so nasty to me just for saying hello.  I've been very fortunate that I met the owner of a real estate office near my home with some great agents in it.  They have sent me several clients and are just so much fun to work with.  There is a real estate office in another near by neighborhood that I've been meaning to stop in and visit.  They are a private company that is not associated with any big companies liek RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker, etc.  I had an appointment this afternoon and on my way home, decided to swing by and introduce myself.  I sometimes have clients that do not currently have a real estate agent and I like to refer pre-approved clients to realtors who have helped me in the past.  I also like to match the personality of the client to the personality of the realtor.  I walked into the office and held the door open for a man coming in behind me.  As it turns out, he is the owner of the company.  I explained that I didn't know anything about his company and wanted to learn more as I sometimes hae clients that I refer to realtors.  He asked me several questions.  He had a bit of an accent and I would gather that he might be of Italian, Greek or Middle Eastern descent.  His primary business is investors and property management, but he does do some residential mortgages.  I told him that I had some investors that might be interested in speaking with him and he said he would review his list of clients and try to send me a client.  I reached out to shake his hand just as he removed a papertowel from his hand and revealed that part of his finger was missing.  He put the papertowel back on his finger.  I smiled and we shook hands.  It was one of those paintings that Norman Rockwell forgot to paint: Ambitious Loan Officer Meets Realtor with Seven Fingers.  I walked away from the meeting feeling very good about it even though so many things were not what I expected.  I had a really good feeling about going today as if all the stars were in allignment.  I guess we'll see what happens.

       F*#@KIN' FORGIVENESS   I've written a lot about forgiveness lately because it just keeps coming up in my life lately.  It's sort of like when I bought a Miata, I began noticing just how many Miatas were on the road... and not one as sharp as mine.  Yesterday, I ran to the bank and picked up some lunch on my designated lunch break.  I'm driving back to the house and go through the green light.  This African-American couple walk out into the middle of the road with a baby in a stroller and I have to break quickly.  I didn't even come close to hitting them, but I'm wondering to myself why they are J-walking in the middle of the street and walking through a line of cars going the opposite way from me.  I couldn't see them for the cars so when they walked out into the street, it was like they were just jumping out in front of me without warning.  I have no idea why they didn't go to the corner and wait for the light.  Anway, I motioned for them to cross since I'm already stopped and they just stand there and stare at me like I've done something terrible to them.  I was tempted to rev the engine to motivate them on, but I found myself thinking, "Okay, practice what you preach.  Maybe they are just embarrassed or don't understand how their actions jeopardized their lives.  We all make mistakes.  No one was hurt.  Just let it go."  So I took a deep breathe and just let it go and it felt good.  This afternoon, I ran by Target on my way home and the guy in front of me stops in the parking garage and puts on his emergency lights.  A lady walked up to cross over to the store and I stopped.  She stopped.  I motioned for her to go and she motioned for me to go.  Then the guy opens his door so I have to stop.  Then she frowns and looks at me and mouths something and starts to cross the road shaking her head so I start laughing.  This seems to piss her off even more.  What can I do?  I think about what happened yesterday, take a deep breathe and let it go.  I wondered what was going on in that lady's life to make her so disagreeable.  I wished her the best and moved on.  It reminds me of something Louise Hay once said about people getting upset about driving in traffic with bad drivers.  "Why should I get upset because you can't drive?"  It's true.  We all choose whether to invest our energy into getting upset about what someone does or does not do.  We should think about whether it is worth the price before we get upset.  Granted, there have been times where I debated the price, decided it was worth it and then went for the jugular vein.  IN the end, I didn't feel good about it and usually paid for it.  Who was it who once said, "Do you wanna be right or do you wanna be happy?"

       POST MORTEM OF SENATE RESOLUTION 595   In November, Georgia voters will decide whether the state constitution should ban same-sex couples from marrying.  On a second attempt, the state House of Represenatives approved this anti-gay marriage amendment last Wednesday.  Supposedly the four or five votes that made the difference were from the Legislative Black Caucus that lobbied fellow caucus members to vote against SR 595.  "It is a night of relief, and we are gratified that this is behind us," stated Sadie Fields, the chair of the Christian Coalition of Georgia.  "It's just good that this moment has been finished for once and for all, and that the people will have the voice that they deserve."  As she completed her comments to the press Wednesday evening, Gregory Casajuana, a gay 15-year-old, wrapped his arms around Ms. Fields and said, "I would like to give you a hug and say, 'Thank you for taking my rights away.'"  It seems several legislators who voted in favor of SR 595 felt their actions were being unfairly labeled as  discriminatory .  What?!  Say it isn't so.  "We've been called bigots, we've been called full of hate and hate-filled," said Rep Barbara Bunn (R-Conyers) during the House debate on Wednesday.  "But the Judeo-Christian values that have held our society together for all these years is not equated to bigotry and hatred."  I supposed that is easy for her to say when she hasn't been chased down an alley by Baptist boys with tire irons for being different.  "Jesus told me to kill all faggots and I killed 'em good.  In fact, I mounted one of the heads up above my fire place between the buck and the moose head."  Bless her heart.    Sate Rep. Sue Burmeister (R-Augusta) doesn't feel that gays and lesbians face discrimination when it comes to marriage.  "No one is preventing homosexuals from living together -- all homosexuals have the right to get married and have that marriage sanctioned by the state.  They just have to marry someone of the opposite sex -- the same rights I have.  If society is forced to redefine marriage, then we are establishing new and special rights."  Oh, I know she did not say  special rights .  However, she has a point and I think I would like to explore the possibility of marriage further with her daughter.  She did not state that I had to have sex with her daughter, but just to marry her for those unspecial rights.  We would move in with Sue and I would bring my  close friends  over to the house and we would have boys only Bible study up in my bedroom with the door lock.  "Sue, now don't you worry when you hear those screams coming from behind the closed doors. I'm just exercising, uh exorcizing those demons out of his body."  Bless her heart.  "We all know the story of Sodom and Gomorrah -- men of the city wanting the male angels," said Rep. Hinson Mosley (D-Jesup).  Excuse me, I though the issue raised in this particular scripture was sexual assault and not gay sex.  Therefore, if the men of the city wanted female angels, it would have been okay because they were probably all painted up like cheap hussies and deserved to be raped anyway.  I was blind, but now I see.  Bless his heart.  I think it is interesting with the number of men and women dying in Iraq that the issues that have captured the attention of the American people so far this year have been Janet Jackson's Nipple Gate and whether we should change our most precious government document, the Constitution of the United State of America, to ensure that only the  right people  are allowed to have the benefits of a legally recognized union.  After all, we have to preserve the sanctity of marriage, right?  Ironically, Rep. Tom Bordeaux (D-Savannah) proposed an amendment that would have added a ban on adultery, but some of the good ol' boys in the House were too busy out fornicatin' to pass that amendment.  Bless their little bitty, teeny tiny... hearts.  Rep. Nan Orrock (D-Atlanta), the House Majority whip also proposed an amendment to SR 595 that would have removed Section B, which is the piece of legislation that critics argue will prevent private companies and local governments from offering domestic partner benefits to gay couples.  It was defeated also.  So, in effect, not only am I unable to enjoy the rights of marriage as recognized by the state of Georgia, unless I marry Rep. Burmeister' daughter, but now I am unable to receive medical benefits from my partner's employer even if they have agreed to do so. Bless my heart... and bless my soul.  I'm screwed!  On the bright side, it seems that the push toward discriminating against gays and lesbians is creating sympathy amongst younger heterosexuals in the U.S.  The polls show that more people are reconsidering their position either because of the fact that don't find this issue significant enough to change the Constitution or perhaps they have become more educated as more gays and lesbians have come out and shown how normal and non-threatening we really are.  The Executive Director of Georgia Equality, Allen Thornell, said the outcome of last Wednesday has only motivated him to continue the good fight and not give up.  "My first reaction was, 'OK, now we're going to have a ballot initiative.' We lost this time, but the discussion that this will cause about gay and lesbian issues around the state will change the state of Georgia forever."  In closing, I think the answer is education.  Many heterosexuals still believe they do not know any homosexuals when their daugher has a crew cut, wears flannel and is the president of the local Indigo Girls Fan Club.  There is still a lot of fear out there.  You say that you're gay and many people still immediately visualize you in a compromising position with all the members of the Village People.  People are only now beginning to learn that we can settled down and have commited relationships and can care and love one another and even raise children.  Let's show them that GLBT people come in a variety of flavors and we are not all mincing, lisping faggots or macho butch lesbians.  And when we do decide to mince or be butch, we're fabulous!  We must stop the dissemination of any lies and untruths about homosexuals.  Now, if you will excuse me, I have to go sprinkle fairy dusts into individual ziplock bags.  I'm hitting the school yards early tomorrow to get my converts.  I'm only 23 newly converted homosexuals away from a stainless steel toaster oven, which will look fabulous in my kitchen.   "Then said Jesus, 'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.'" Luke 23:34 King James Version

       SINGLE STRAIGHT MEN AND THEIR CATS   Last night I spent about half an hour looking at other blogs.  I came across this straight guy who is into soccer, fast cars and has a cat named Ms. Sadie.  For some reason, this just stood out like a sore thumb to me.  I can't think of any straight guys I know who own cats without a wife or live-in girlfriend.  Strangely enough, a straight man living alone with a cat is like a girl riding in a truck between two guys.  It just has a scarlet letter written all over it.  Then I stopped myself.  I reprimanded myself for marginalizing a minority, straight single guys with cats, not crabs.  I sometimes wonder if the Senate Resolution 595 hasn't fixated my mind on gay-only issues and made me insensitive to the needs of my straight friends.  So I shifted my perception with an audible pop and imagined what my life as a cat would be like with a straight owner.  I imagined that there would be plenty of pizza to eat and beer to drink.  There were be lots of dirty laundry all over the floors and furniture to take little cat naps on.  I would probably be tossed around a bit as if I were a football.  "Hey Jerry, go on out for a pass and I'll throw Sadie to you."  I would dread whenever his friend, Roger,  would come over.  Roger is a punter.  I imagined myself cleaning myself one evening in the living room as I hear my owner talking on the phone to one of his buddies about his new girlfriend.  It's all rather trivial and I usually tune him out as I crane my neck around to lick my anus when I suddenly hear my owner say something about eating pussy.  My head shoots up and I stare at my owner, ready for his first move.  My claws are ready.  I am ready for my opportunity.  I'm not going to be feline mingon.  As soon as the door opens, I'm out of here.  No, I just can't imagine a cat living with a single straight guy.  It's beyond the realm of my imagination.

       THE DAY IN REVIEW   Do you ever have one of those days where you were very busy, but upon review, you don't have much to show for it?  That's what today felt like.  I'm working on several different projcets at once and have completed none of them.  However, I'm going to take a break and go the gym and will come back and finish one before the day is over.  I created a newsletter to send out to former clients and potential new ones.  It really has turned out nicely.  I'm still working on the first time home buyers workshop, which has been a little more complicated than I would have anticipated.  During my lunch break, I decided to go into my bedroom and go through a box.  I found a bunch of old cassettes that I now have on CD.  I guess I'll put them on eBay so that someone who will appreciate them will find them.  I'm really trying to free up some space in my life from things that I no longer need or use.    I also jumped rope this morning.  I'm still surprised at what a great workout that is in just ten minutes.  I have decided to jump rope every morning and continue with weight lifting three days a week with some possbile in-line skating or swimming on the other days.  I think I may have gotten too comfortable with carbs again.  I had a burrito for lunch today and I forgot to tell them to cut the rice.  I feel a bit bloated today as a result.

       COLD MORNING THOUGHTS   A northern blew in Saturday night and we woke up to a cold morning.  I'm not a cold morning person.  When I wake up, I look at the clock and like to snuggle under the covers and enjoy the warmth for just a bit longer.  When I was a very small child, my mother brought me a book about two chipmunks that lived under the front steps of a family of four.  I don't know if the chipmunks were living an alternative lifestyle, because the pictures did not indicate a flashy wardrobe, a fixation on Madonna or a fabulous apartment.  The antagonist of the story was a cat that cramped the chipmunks' lifestyle so they got rid of him.  I don't think they did anything as poisoning the cat or enticing him into the wood chipper, but they cleverly removed the cat from the premises.  The last picture showed the chipmunks sleeping together on some straw.  They were snuggled up together and sleeping together with warmth from the body heat.  That image comes to mind every time I'm snuggled under the comforter and thinking about facing the cold air.  If it is espcially cold, I pull the comforter over my head and imagine that my starship has crash landed on the froze planet Tundra and the comforter is a technologically advanced cover that will use my body heat to keep me warm and put me into a state of supsended animation until help arrives.  Then I'll drift off to sleep.  It's strange, I know, but it works for me.

       PALM SUNDAY   2F's and I went to the MLK Chapel at Morehouse College today for a Plam Sunday Service.  Atlanta Unity was invited to hold their service there by Dean Carter.  I was happy that 2F's went with me.  It meant a lot to me.  Joan was on stage singing with the choir.  I always identify her by her tennis shoes.  The sermon was on religious tolerance.  Reverand Strickland told the story of how Ghandi read the Bible and then remarked that it was a shame that no one seemed to be putting it to use.  In spite of the marketing that the U.S. is a Christian nation, I often times look at our actions and have to disagree.  Why are we still living an eye for an eye and not turning the other cheek?  If Jesus appeared on the planet now, I wonder what he would think of the teachings that have evolved into Christianity.

       MY GRANDMOTHER'S AIR CONDITIONER   For some reason I was thinking about window box air conditioner units.  I think I may have seen some advertised in this week's Sunday ads.  You don't see them much anymore.  However, we saw one yesterday in the Public Storage office.  I was amazed at how cool it made the office when it was so hot and muggy outside.  My grandmother and my Aunt Barbara did not have central air conditioning in their houses.  They had these air conditioners in windows throughout the house.  They were so foreign to me.  I would look at them and place my face close to the vent and it would chill my face.  I would step away and put my hands on my face and be amazed at how icy my skin had become.  My grandmother also had a makeup mirror that had the colored slides that would change the light to various times of day.  I didn't understand why it was important, but it came back to me during my TV production classes in college.  Sometimes I would steal away to my grandmother's bedroom in the afternoon.  I would lay on her bed and stare at the air conditioner as I listened to the steady rhythm of its rumblings.  Often times I would fall asleep to this mechanized lullaby.  I miss those air conditioners; when I see them, I always smile.

       SCREENPLAY UNDER CONSTRUCTION   So I have to write the rest of the screenplay, about 110 pages, in less than two weeks.  This will give me a week to do have people read it and give me feedback so that I can do rewrite and make corrections in the last week.  As fate would have it, we had already planned to do a neighborhood yardsale the morning of the Perfect Pitch Contest.  I've spent the past few days looking over my screenplay books, fleshing out the treatment, creating character biographies, sketching out scenes on index cards and I think I'm ready to begin writing tomorrow morning.  I have found looking over Syd Fields'  The Screenwriter's Workbook  to be very helpful.  I had read his first book, Screenplay, back in the summer of '92, so I guess that makes it exactly 12 years ago.  Eek!  I can't believe that much time has gone by and I feel as if I have done nothing.  Still, I was having life experiences that have led me to writing this screenplay today.  At least 13 years have not gone by.  As I have read through the book, things have come back to me quickly, such as the setup, plot point one, conflict, plot point two and the resolution.  There have even been some new concepts such as the pinch.  All in all, ideas have come to me to flesh out the story and characters with deeper meaning and symbolism.  I'm very excited.  I'm also feeling very confident.  I trust that when I sit down to write and do the work, the ideas and answers come to me easily and effortlessly... and they have.  It's as if the story is writing itself and I'm only taking it down.  I remembered the first time the character of Millicent came to me.  I was driving to work last summer and in my mind I was sitting on Jay and Susan's porch next door.  She was selling Girl Scout cookies.  I told her that I was on the South Beach Diet and currently doing Phase One.  She reminded me that Girl Scout cookies freeze well and I knew that she was a force to be reckoned with.  Over the course of time, her gay neighbor, Chuck, and her mother, Kylie, entered the picture as well as her best friend, Emily.  Then Chuck's boyfriend, Bob, showed up and things began to gel.  It all sounded like a crazy idea at first.  Who would want to read a script or watch a movie about these people.  Millicent looked at me with love and patience in her eyes.  She said, "Trust me."  So I did and here I am writing a script about these people.  I've also realized that this story is about a scared little girl who learns, through trying to control the people and events around her, to embrace faith.  There are few things I want to tweak about the first ten pages to tighten it up a bit, but for the most part, it will stay the same.  I feel as if the screenplay is teaching me a lot about myself now.

       NORWEGIAN YARDSALES ARE THE STRANGEST THINGS   You would think that once our company left, Jefffifer would slow down.  Sadly, it's not to be.  Jeff and I went on an excursion yesterday morning to move his books from one storage facility to another.  Afterwards, we had lunch at the Australian Bakery in East Atlanta.  I thought I ordered a big fluffy thing, but what I received was a small thick wedge of pork pie.  It was good, but I was really hankering for the big fluffy thing.  Next time, I'll have to be more specific when I point to something in the glass case and ensure that whisk the right item out and into the oven.  I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning and doing laundry.  I'm buidling a portfolio website for my written works and put that up on the server.  It's amazing how many websites I have up and out there.  I'll post the URL once I finish for those who would like to visit and give me feedback.  I was actually amazed at the amount of poetry, essays, short stories, scripts and plays that I have written in my lifetime... and I still have to find the rest of it.  I'm going to have to type up some of the pieces again.  I've been thinking about this for a while.  Over the past few months, I have come to realize that I want to write and to publish my work.  I figure the best way to do that is to put a portfolio on the Web that I can refer people to.  I went for a run yesterday and it rained half way around the park.  The rain was refreshing.  I took the headphones from my portable CD player and tried them with my Archose Jukebox and it's amazing the difference in the sound quality.  I can actually crank the sound bass up to appropriate levels and have 10GB worth of music at the mercy of my ever changing moods.  Tony and Thom saw me running and asked if Jeff and I wanted to go to dinner with them.  I checked with Jeff when I got home.  Since we were planning on grilling a steak and staying in, the rain put a stop to that.  We went to a new restaurant in East Atlanta called Pasta Thyme.  It was very good.  Afterwards, we went to Jakes Ice Cream for dessert.  I got half a scoop of strawberry cheesecake and chocolate cinnamon.  Everyone else got cotton candy, which tasted amazingly like cotton candy.  Tony shared that he didn't think that cheesecake really tasted like a dessert.  We all took in his opinion and carefully considered it in silence.  I worked on the screenplay last night.  This morning I rose early and went to church for my class.  TOday we discussed praying for others.  It was interesting.  I was taking notes with a pen that has a light built into it.  I kept unconsciously clicking it and blinding the instructor.  We went to lunch with Brian and Brian at Einstein's.  We discussed religion and invasions by gay aliens from outer space and burying saints to find lost objects.  It was very educational and nutritious.  Afterwards, Jeff and I went to a yardsale around the corner and they were selling Ivory soap, but the packaging was in Norwegian.  It was a strange selection of items.  The proprieter was also selling songs from the 80's and 90's off his laptop for a dollar.  I was curious as to what kind of royalties he was paying to the recording industry, but didn't ask.  I'm waiting for Tim to pick me up and we are going to go see Van Helsing.  Afterwards, Jeff will meet us for dinner.  I was hoping to go to Michael's so I could buy a Sharpie marker set with fifteen different colors, but Tim says that Michael's closed where we are going.  I was speechless.  Tomorrow, I'm not planning to do anything but work on my screenplay and exercise.  I think I have successfully spent time with everyone that I have been putting off for months.  Maybe I can take a nap before Tim gets here.

       GOODBYE CANADIAN FRIENDS   So Joel & Merideth left to drive home to Canada around lunchtime yesterday.  Afterwards, Jeff and I lay on my bed and just felt sad.  I was amazed at how quickly you can form a bond with people that you just met a week ago.  In fact, I realized that I was getting sad Thursday and willed myself to zoom out in my perspective so as not to be maudlin.  Jeff met Joel's older brother, Jeff, on a missionary trip back in 1989.  They became fast friends and Jeff refers to Jeff as his other brother Jeff.  Jeff usually flies up to Canada after Christmas each year and visits.  He considers them to be his extended family.  In 1999, I met Jeff for the first time and I would say we hit it off well.  Last year, I met Jeff's wife and kids.  This year I met Joel and his wife, Merideth.  Jeff just told them that he was gay last Christmas.  Saturday night, we went to Dakota Blue and had dinner.  I suggested fish tacos and J&M thought I was making it up.  Merideth decided to be bold and got the fish tacos and really enjoyed them.  Afterwards, we walked back home, chatted a bit and went to bed.  The next morning, they went to church and I met them at Cafe 458.  We had lunch and went to Zoo Atlanta.  It was nice to finally go since I've been a member for two years.  Afterwards, we went to Jake's Ice Cream and I had half a scoop of Animal Crackers ice cream and half a scoop of Chocolate Cinnamon ice cream.  We went to Publix and bought groceries.  We grilled hamburgers and watched  Coupling  over lemon ice box pie.  Monday evening, J&M took in the MLK Memorial and Little Five Points.  I met them after my first time home buyers workshop and we had dinner at Commune. We then took the fifty cent tour of Atlanta.  On Tuesday, they went to World of Coca Cola while I was at work.  We went to see the Chihuly glass exibhit at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens.  I saw the fitness model who used to go to my gym.  He's been in several magazine covers and he models some swim line that is based here in Atlanta.  Small world.  Then we went to Loca Luna for tapas.  On Wednesday, we attempted to go to the drive in, but decided to go to Chick-Fil-A instead.  We toured East Atlanta and got coffee and Java Joe's.  On Thursday, we went to Fat Matt's for barbecue and then to the gay sports bar, Woof's for a beer.  Afterwards, we went to Backstreet to see Charlie Brown's Exotic Cabaret.  We couldn't figure out why it was so dead until we ordered some drinks.  We forgot their liquor license had been suspended.  It was fun.  Joel had a really good time laughing at Charlie Brown's bad jokes.  This morning we got up and made muffins and took it easy.  J&M packed up and loaded their car.  They rode Jeff's little motorized scotter up and down the block. They took our picture in front of the house and then left.  They gave Jeff some wind chimes as a thank you gift for letting them visit.  It will be nice when Jeff hangs them up because whenever we hear them, we'll think of J&M.

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY KENT AND KYLIE   Today is the 35th birthday of my best friend, Kent, and Australian singer, Kylie Minogue.  I find it interesting that they share the same date of birth.  Unfortunately, I will be unable to celebrate with either one since Kent is dead and Kylie is in Australia, France or London.  Still, I shall mentally send a shout-out to the ethereal realms and down under.  I didn't necessarily like Kent the first time that I met him.  We were both in the seventh grade.  I thought he was strange.  He had brown curly hair and would sit beside me on the school benches at lunch and recite strange poetry such as:   Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And every where that Mary went She stood on it   He really didn't have anything on Sylvia Plath, but I guess you could say it was... inspired.  Kent and I crossed paths at a strange time in both of our lives.  My family had just moved to Burleson, Texas and I was having a hard time adjusting to this small town.  I discovered that I was one of those socially phobic people who didn't know how to mingle.  Making friends was very difficult for me and I ran from my loneliness into the company of books.  These weren't necessarily good books either.  If I recall, one of them was a paperback novelization of David Cronenberg's  Scanners .  Kent was the youngest child of three splitting time between divorced parents.  As fate would have it, Kent actually lived two streets over from me and we rode the same bus.  Over the course of time, we eventually began to hang out together.  One of our first activities was to play strip poker in my father's camper.  It wasn't a sexual thing at all.  It was just the most visible way we could think of to show progress in the game.  I don?t even think we made it down to underwear before we lost interest.  Kent was famous for putting his belongings down and leaving them anywhere.  My father mowed over far too many of Kent's shoes and socks than he cares to remember.  Kent also had a hot temper at times. You never knew what would set him off, but for the most part, he was usually jovial.  One day while sitting on the couch, a commercial for a evening news program with Connie Chung came on TV.  Kent?s face contorted up like a constipated, walrus rectum and shouted at the TV.  ?I fucking hate Connie Chung!?  It was never clear to me why he felt that way.   Kent and I were so close that we could often finish each other sentences.  We had a very similar sense of humor.  We used to look at one another and imitate smalltown Texas women by saying, "I don?t know why Betty.  I don?t know why.?  We thought it was hilarious and that?s all that mattered.  Somewhere I still have the script for our comic masterpiece, Spittle On My Windmill.  At one point, Kent and I decided to make a science fiction movie with my parents? Super 8 camera.  It was a rip-off of Forbidden Planet and Alien, but we were excited about it.  Kent played the bloodthirsty creature who is destroyed in a burst of flames by a psychic laser beam at the end.  Kent said he knew how to make some flame-retardant substance with every day household items found in the kitchen.  He was going to whip some up on the stove so we could lather it all over him and then set fire to him with the camera rolling.  Unfortunately, somebody?s parents found out and soon halted production on our blockbuster on a shoestring.  It was a shame too because we had already written the theme song.  Meanwhile, Kylie released I Should Be So Lucky in the U.S.  I saw the video on MTV and bought the 7? record without knowing who she was.  She later covered The Loco-Motion, which was one of my favorite songs as a kid.  Her music was as innocent and nave as I was about human nature at the time.  When I moved out of my parents? house to go to school at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), Kent moved into an apartment down the street with his lover, Roger.  We saw each other or spoke on the phone at least once a day.  Any new people who entered our lives had to understand that you just didn?t get one of us, you got both of us.  This was tested once when one of Kent?s boyfriends came on to me.  I really liked Brian and thought they made a great couple, but I didn?t want to stir trouble up.  Maybe I was jumping to conclusions.  Besides, Kent was too much in love with Brian to believe me.  They broke up a month or so later and I finally told Kent.  He didn?t think I was making it up and he agreed that if I had told him at the time, he wouldn?t have believed me.  Kylie and I were estranged from 1989-1990.  She wasn?t on the radio in the U.S. and since I didn?t know any of the songs on Enjoy Yourself, I opted to purchase something else with my limited budget.  I later bought a Stock Aitken Waterman megamix that had Never Too Late on it.  I fell in love with the song and went out and scored a copy of Enjoy Yourself at Half Price Books.  It was good to be friends again.  When I graduated from college, I made Kent a cassette tape with various dance music that we liked.  It was called the Bitch Goddess Tape and Kylie was included in the mix as well as Bananarama and Betty Boo.  We would play it in the car when we drove around together and sing at the top of our lungs.  When I graduated from UTA, I bought Kylie?s Rhythm Of Life CD and some Eternity cologne by Calvin Klein.  I was ready to be in a relationship now and What Do I Have To Do was my theme song.  Little did I know that I would be waiting to meet Kirk until later that autumn.  In the mean time, I sang along to Shocked, Stepped Back In Time and Better The Devil You Know.  Kent and I began going two-steppin? at the Roundup in Dallas.  I was now entering my country phase and showed little interest in Kylie?s Let?s Get To It album.  Instead I would watch cowboys moving about the dance floor with their arms around one another in the soft lights while Pam Tillis sang Maybe It Was Memphis.  Sometimes I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of those cowboys.  I packed up and moved to Dallas in the summer of ?92.  I received Kylie?s Greatest Hits for my 25th birthday and found it hard to get too worked up over What Kind Of Fool (Heard All That Before) and her cover of Kool & the Gang?s Celebration.  It was a good mirror of where I was emotionally.  Kent had entered massage school.  I found myself entrenched in one short-lived relationship after another with emotionally unavailable guys.  My contact with other friends occurred less because I now lived in Dallas.  My temp-to-perm job was going nowhere.  In 1993, Kent was diagnosed with aids.  It was a long quiet period as Kylie recreated herself after the PWL years and Kent and I learned how his illness would change our friendship.  I asked him if knew who had infected him with hiv and he said that he knew.  I asked him why he had unprotected sex and he said that he was afraid that if he made the guy use a condom, he would go away and he didn?t want to be alone.  Those words made my blood chill.  How could my best friend have such little regard for himself and his health?  Why wasn?t I a better friend?  Why didn?t he talk to me about this earlier?  However, in time I learned that had very little to do with me and more to do with human nature.  It was just the nature of the beast, that?s all.  Kent drifted back to Fort Worth and a new boyfriend in 1994.  I moved out of the apartment that I shared with Chris and Susan began dating Sue.  I suddenly found myself alone.  By September, I was hit hard by a dysfunctional relationship with a guy named Mark.  One minute he was loving and kind and the next he was downright mean.  The worse he treated me, the more I wanted him.  Kylie?s Confide In Me intrigued me with the dark secrets that I knew lay within Mark, but it was Put Yourself In My Place that helped me grieve the loss of the relationship.  Kent had his first brush with death the following year.  I went to visit him in the hospital.  He was emaciated and jaundiced.  I didn?t know what to do.  Kent and I had become estranged during his last relationship and we found ourselves staring at one another and wondering who the hell this person was.  Later that year, Kent recovered and moved in with me for a few months.  He did well during that time and was very involved with some programs for people living with aids at the local aids resource center.  More importantly, we got to know each other again.  He thrived for awhile and then his health spiraled downward.  He moved in with his mother and suddenly I was alone again.  I moved to Atlanta the following year.  I went to see Kent before I left.  We took a walk outside and he got somewhat emotional.  I told him that if he needed me, I would come back to Texas.  I would be there for him.  However, it?s hard to believe when your heart is full of fear.  After I moved to Atlanta, I had a dream that Kent was in trouble.  The next morning, there was a voice mail message from Kent in the middle of the night.  He was tearful and said that he hoped that I would come home if he died.  I felt selfish for moving and I just wanted to cry.  In ?97, I had received a promotion, Jeff and I had started dating and Kylie released Some Kind Of Bliss.  I found the new and improved Indie Kylie to be revitalizing.  Kent has responded well to the drug cocktail and recovered nicely.  He entered a rehab program for people living with aids.  Kent proceeded to come in and out of my life.  It was frustrating.  He?d be there for awhile and then he?d be unavailable.  I knew it was his way of dealing with his disease, but I found it taking a toll on me emotionally.  During Christmas of ?98, I told him how I felt.  I asked him to either let me back into his life fully or just shut me out, but quit treating me like a yo-yo.  So he let me back into his life fully.  The following year, I met his boyfriend, Blaise, who I immediately adored.  I could not have found a better match for Kent.  He finished his rehab program and went back to work full-time.  He was doing well.  Meanwhile, Kylie got her momentum back with those gold hot pants and Spinning Around.  The album Light Years made her hot again. She had reinvented herself.  Kent and Blaise had moved into a house when I saw them during Christmas 2000.  They only had mobile phones at this time as they were in hiding from Blaise?s ex-boyfriend, Robert.  They believed Robert had set the house that Blaise was renting a room in on fire.  Now he was stalking them.  Kent had just come from applying for his permit to own a gun before we went to dinner.  As I was leaving, I told him I didn?t think the gun was a good idea, but I knew his mind was made up.  I hugged him goodbye and there was a bad feeling in my gut.  I knew the gun meant trouble.  On the evening of January 3, 2001, Donna called me to say that Kent had been killed the night before.  Robert had tried to break into the house and Kent went outside with the gun to confront him.  If Kent could keep Robert on the premises, the police would be able to do something about the situation.  Robert ran for it.  Kent went after him.  Robert jumped into his Jeep and took off.  He hit Kent and drug him for several blocks.  Kent died a few moments later.  Because death was always a possibility for Kent, he had clear instructions for what he wanted his funeral arrangements to be.  Donna and I were to each give a eulogy.  I made plans to fly home.  I dreaded seeing Kent?s body at the viewing.  I had not cried yet and I was terrified that I would choke up when I saw him laying there.  I didn?t want to confront my feelings in front of others.  It was something I felt more comfortable doing alone.  Ironically, I was fine when I saw him.  He looked so peaceful laying there in his sweater.  I stayed up all night trying to find the perfect words to send off my best friend.  I mentioned funny moments and touching moments, but most of all, I saw Kent dancing.  He loved country and western dancing.  No matter what life threw his way, he could find peace in movement on the dance floor.  He was confident and graceful? and immortal.  We played The Dance by Garth Brooks.  I went to another memorial service that evening.  It was people that Kent knew from a church he went to occasionally.  These were friends he knew from aids organizations.  They were people I didn?t know.  They talked about memories that were foreign to me.  They laughed at jokes that were not share with me and I hated Kent for that.  I was furious with him for hiding from me for all those times when he wouldn?t return my phone calls.  I was angry with him for not sharing his life with me when he got sick and when I shared everything with him.  Now, our time had run out.  I didn?t have any reason to be mad at him, but it?s what I felt at the time.  A week later, I was driving home from work and I felt Kent?s presence in the car.  Well, I felt his energy.  It was more like that.  He was checking on me.  I told him to go away.  There were other people who needed him now.  I didn?t want him around me. I was still pissed and I needed time to cool down so I could forgive him.  Eventually, I did. I never did cry, but I do feel that I grieved in spite of what anyone else said.  Instead, I found myself thinking of things that I wanted to tell Kent only to remember that he was dead and that I could not tell him.  A few years later, I visited Blaise at the holidays.  He told me that he went with some friends to see a channeller who was making a presentation to a small group.  An hour into the meeting, Kent came to her and told her what to say to Blaise.  Blaise said he knew it was Kent.  Before he left, he told Blaise to tell me hello and that he was okay.  Somehow, I believe Blaise.    Kylie ended that year with a huge hit in Can?t Get You Out Of My Head and the album Fever.  This time there was no one to share it with.  I miss Kent. I wish he was still here with me, but I like to think he lives through Kylie?s music.  If you want to find him, I would advise you to check the dance floor.

       A CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE ON LESBIAN SEX APPEAL   So I asked Joel last night, "Why does seeing two women having sex together turn heterosexual men on?"  He kind of smiled with a faraway look in his eyes as if he disappeared into some special place within himself.  "Well, I uh.... It's just hot."  "I think men find it intriguing," Merideth began.  "But they would never act on it."  "Why wouldn't they?" I asked.  "It's sexier in theory than in reality."  "So what do heterosexual women think about watching two men having sex together?"  Merideth tilted her head to the side and stared at a box of books across the room as if she was scrying with a crystal ball for the answer.  "I'd rather watch two men clean my house and talk about their feelings.  That turns me on.  Clothes are optional."  You learn something new every day.

       HOORAY FOR CHICK-FIL-A   As you can probably tell, it's been a busy week.  Tonight we took Joel & Merredith to the original Chick-Fil-A Dwarf House restaurant.  We went through the dwarf door and had the Chick-Fil-A sandwich platter.  They were big hits.  We even had peach pie with ice cream.  I'm having a lot of fun, but my waist is expanding.

       JUST PINCH ME!   I was trying to send a fax when the phone rang.  I had already been interupted once before by Erin from Sign-A-Rama and someone calling for Lucilia.     "Hello?" I asked abruptly.  "Jef?"  "Yes?"  "This is Mark with Image Film & Video Center and I was just calling to let you know that you are a finalist in the 2004 Perfect Pitch Contest."   I smiled.  Mark talked on a bit about some important things like when I had to show up on June 19th at the Atlanta Film Festival and some sort of orientation.  I was in a daze.   "Okay," I began.  "I just want to make sure that I heard correctly.  So my treatment and first ten pages of my script were chosen for me to pitch my script to the industry professionals at the Atlanta Film Festival."  "Yes."   It was like my mind was running underwater.  Listening took so much effort.  Mark said something about needing to make other phone calls and I think he thought I was under the impression that I had won the whole contest or something.  I thanked him and got off the phone.  I immediately felt like a total dork and then got it over it and I think I actually screamed like a teenage girl, but it came out sounding like a 13-year-old boy whose voice is in the middle of changing.  I ran to the front door only to realize that there was no one to tell.  I called Jeff, but got his voice mail.  I left a little message.  I called Mark because he's always accessible and left a message.  Merrideth and Joel came home from the MLK Memorial and I told them the news.  They were very gracious about the whole thing.  I sent out an e-mail out to a few people to let them know, but I didn't feel right posting anything until I received the official e-mail from Mark.  I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to concentrate on my work.  Someone asked me if I was already dreaming of my first Oscar.  This seemed like such an odd thing to even think about.  I almost didn't even enter the contest because I didn't have a lot of time and I thought my idea wasn't very good.  However, I decided that it was important to go ahead and enter because I was always putting this kind of thing on the "One Day" list because there was always so much other more important stuff to do.  I felt so good when I sent my entry off because I finally did something for myself.  My friend, Tim, from my writers' group recently found out that he won first place in the O Georgia writing competition.  He received right before he left to go to a writing conference and said that it made him officially feel like he was a writer and belonged at the conference.  I cannot tell you the difference that I saw in him at the last meeting.  Today, I really understood what he felt.  It was nice to receive validation that the little markings I put on paper were perceived as worthwhile and valuable.    It has seemed like careerwise I have faced a lot of obstacles lately and I can't help but wonder if this is a sign that perhaps writing may be a future career one day.    So what's next?  I have an orientation to go to at some point where they explain what we need to do.  I don't have to show my script until the day of the event, which is good because I haven't finished yet.  I pitch, or explain why my movie should be made, to industry professionals on June 19th at the Atlanta Film Festival.  This will be done before a live audience, as opposed to a dead one I guess.  I have a friend who has some film experience and I'll ask him for some pointers on pitching.  I'll need to practice, practice, practice.  Three scripts will be chosen to be sent off to industry professionals in New York and LA.  They will determine one winner who will be flown to LA to pitch their script to several studios.  I can't tell you how honored I feel that my script was one of the ten chosen.  Yes, I must admit, it would be nice to win and see my script made into a movie.  However, what I want most is to have a script that will make the reader laugh, perhaps shed a tear, but ultimately finish the script feeling satisfied that the character seemed like real people and somehow changed by the story.  I want to do good work.  Right now, I'm just staying in the moment and feeling thankful.

       AD SPACE   So I decided to put an ad in the  urlLink Southern Voice  to see if would bring me some extra business.  I spoke with the account executive, David, and sent him a copy of my business card and a headshot so they could put together a design.  I received their comp back on Friday and it didn't even have the company logo on it.  In fact, the whole design did not even seem to match the style of our company.  So I pulled up Photoshop and Illustrator and got to work.  I don't think of myself as much of a graphic designer, but with a little patience, I came up a with an ad that make me very proud.  I pulled down the logo from our Web site because our Vice President does not seem to be able to obtain a copy from the designer in an uncorrupted format.  I'm just very please with myself.  It made me feel like that $17,000 I spent on that Web design degree is finally being put to use.  I'm not really thrilled with the headshot.  Everyone says that it is a very attractive picture, but I think my hair looks funny and I look odd in a suit.  It's definitely not Jef in his natural habitat.  Let's hope that it generates some business for me to make it worthwhile.

       CANADIANS IN THE SOUTH   The Canadians finally arrived yesterday evening.  My friend, Karen, pointed out that in speaking of the Canadians invading the house, it makes it sound like they are an ominous virus descending upon our cell structure.  Well, I in no way meant to imply their visit was unwelcome.  In fact, I rather like Joel & Merredith.  Joel looks somewhat like his brother, Jeff, but for the most part looks very different.  He's alittle more laid back too.  Merrideth reminds me of prettier Bjork.  She is kind of pixie-esque, moves quickly about the house as if she is sprinkling fairy dust around the house and ends most sentences with an upward inflection as if she is always asking a question.  I noticed this because this way of speaking is noted in the book,  She's Not There , which I am currently reading.  More about that later.  We walked across the park and had dinner at Dakota Blue last night.  Joel & Merrideth thought I was joking when I mentioned the fish tacos, but Merrideth was game enough to try them.  Then we came back and crashed.  I slept eight and a half hours last night.  I normally cannot sleep beyond six or seven hours.  However, Jeff and I were exhausted from cleaning.  The only thing about impending guests that I regret, is that Jeff and I usually become very irritated with one another about this process.  Jeff's idea of cleaning is somewhere just shy of burning the entire village to ensure a complete quaratine of the ebola virus.  Places people normally don't look must be deconstructed, sanitized and reconstructed.  However, the real cherry on top of my sundae was when he made the comment about my having too much stuff in my bedroom.  I slowly looked around the house at the boxes of books and papers and tool boxes and clothes draped over furniture and said, "My stuff is contained in my bedroom.  Your combined closet space is four times the size of mine.  I am not getting rid of all of my belongings to sastify your sense of order when you are not willing to compromise and give up your own stuff."  Five minutes later, he decided that we could compromise by storing some of my stuff in his closet up stairs.  I'm usually pretty accommodating about living here and letting him pick out the furniture and decorations he wants.  However, this was like when Buddy cornered one of the neighborhood cats in her little box.  My claws came out!  Things are fine between us now.  The amazing thing about love is that even when you hate someone momentarily, you still love them deeply.

       SUNDAY AM   I once made a cool mix tape of slow, soothing songs, which contained a lot of overdubs and synths.  I started out the tape, or perhaps I ended, with a cool song by Book Of Love entitled  Sunday AM .  It was written by Lauren and Ted about their memories of hanging out at the Sound Factory with Junior Vasquez until four in the morning.  The vocals are pretty sparse, but it's very ethereal.  Whenever I heard the track, it would always cause me to pause and literally go to another place.  I used to be very good at that.  I used to go places through out my day.  In the fourth grade, a teacher led excursion to the lunchroom was often being led by Imperial Stormtroopers to interrogation with Darth Vader.  "The fools," I thought to myself.  "Don't they know I can resist the mind probe."  It helped me cope.  When did I lose that ability?  When did I grow up?  I'm beginning to feel that I tap into that again with my writing.  I used to sing along to records in the mirror as a kid.  It's a shame that I never manifested my lip sync talents into female impersonation, but I never felt so inclined.  I have an averstion to ripping duct tape off from between my legs, along with my genitalia.  I think we could all use a little more fantasy and mindless excursion in our lives.

       PERFECT PITCH UPDATE   I had assumed because I had not heard anything by mid-May that I was not selected as a semi-finalist for the  Perfect Pitch Conetest , which is sponsored by  Image Film & Video  and the  Georgia Film Commission .  However, I received my weekly Image e-mail and it states they will announce the ten semi-finalists next week since there was a record number of entries this year.  How exciting!  Of course, I was suddenly hit by a strange bout of self-doubt.  My mind is filled with people who have submitted all these action-adventure stories or scripts about single mothers overcoming schizophrenia in order to finish sewing a decent Easter dresses for their daughters.  My idea about a little girl who decides to kill her next-door neighbor's boyfriend because she is in love with her next-door neighbor just sounds so aburd.  I know it's just the jitters.  I think I'm just tired.  The important thing is that I actually moved beyond my obsessive-compulsive disorder that makes me feel that I must wash all the dishes and clean the house before I can write and sent in the treatment and first ten pages of the screenplay.  I'm sure next year will be even easier.  I'd also like to see an example of a good one-page treatment.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.

       PEEPING ME   I am standing in the bathtub in socked-feet, looking out the small window.  No one can see me because the light is off.  The only illumination comes from the window on the first floor of the house next door. I shift my weight to the other foot.  There is no water in the bathtub.  It is empty except for dead leaves from the suicidal fern perched tragically on the edge of the tub.  I lean closer and my nose scrapes against the screen, which gently grates off imperfections in the skin on a microscopic level.  There is a floor lamp without a shade keeping watch at the open window next door.  The spill of light guards against any intruders who might come too close to his castle keep.  The concertina wire is imagined, but the barrier seems very real between our houses.  I can almost reach out touch the side of his home, but as always, he remains just out of reach.  Beside the lamp I see a computer mini-tower and a portion of the back of an easy chair.  It appears to be gray or could it be that it has faded with time and use like a groove worn into a much played record?  I can't see him, but I hear him blow his nose.  Sometimes I hear him vacuum in the middle of the night.  The sound is soft and alien in the acoustics between our homes, which make it sound like ghostly moans and chains rattling in the attic.  It's like he is trying to erase proof of his existence in order to keep himself secret.  He blows his nose again.  I continue to listen, but he doesn?t say anything.  There is no one else to talk to next door. In fact, I have never heard him speak at all.  The first time I saw him was on a blustery March afternoon.  He parked his pickup in front of his house as I put my trash can on the curb.  He emerged from the truck in an old T-shirt and jeans and his long, stringy hair flowed in the wind like some folliclly-empowered super hero. I said hello.  He stopped and turned to me as if I had surprised him.  His eyes peered out at me from deep within his weathered face.  I looked into them and saw nothing? not even my own reflection.  Did I exist in his eyes?  He grunted and continued his way up the steps into the dilapidated house.  The house is overgrown with ivy, which seems to be invading the house and possibly feeding off it like a parasite.  The roof sags dangerously in back and might cave in at any moment.  There are no shingles on the side of house facing my window and the reflection from the exposed insulation seems to call to addictive sun-worshippers from miles away.  The window remains open even in the cold of winter.  How can he live in this squalor next door to my own neatly organized home with the alphabetized spice rack?    Who is this man?  I have heard that he was a helicopter pilot in the Viet Nam War.  He doesn?t talk about it now - period.  I have also heard that he did too many drugs during the sixties and seventies.  Was it to forget what he refuses to mention?  Is this why he refuses to speak at all?  It all seems so foreign to someone who can barely remember this war ending as a small child.  My memories are relegated to the latter part of the seventies and consist of flashbacks of Farrah Fawcett-Majors and  Star Wars .    I have heard that he is a carpenter, but this cannot be true.  The very idea makes my mind want to implode as I stare at his house that could possibly follow suit at any given moment.    I picture him at some local pub, sitting on a bar stool.  He drinks whisky and chain smokes cigarettes.  He talks to no one, but instead gives his full attention to the small TV mounted over the bar.  Depending upon where you are sitting, one half of his face is the dark side of the moon.  Someone once told me, though I forget which neighbor it may have been, that this man once bought dog food and cared for the dogs of a sick friend or one that had just died.  This makes me like this him.  This makes me want to know more about him.    One day when I was downtown, I decided to go into the courthouse.  I was able to find his full name on his property deed.  I wrote it on a piece of scrap paper and keep it in my dresser drawer.  It makes me feel triumphant when I look at it.  It?s as if I have gotten closer to him without him knowing it.   I strain my eyes with more effort to peep into the window below.  This seems odd to me because I do so in order to hear better.  There are voices, but there is no one else to talk to next door.  Is he talking to himself?  Has he gone crazy?  No, they are voices from the television.  I wonder what types of television programs he might watch.  I picture big-bosomed lifeguards with long, blonde tresses and red lips jiggling into the surf to save children from drowning.  I envision a NASCAR race or footage of cops pulling people over for drunk driving.  Maybe he watches game shows.  However, I recognize the voice and music.  He's watching Public Television.  In fact, he's watching a documentary about Australia.  The voice tells me that there are more ants in Australia than any other place in the world and there is a wide variety of plant and animal life that can kill a grown man in a matter of seconds.  I should be terrified since I am traveling down under in another month, but instead, I smile and think, "I like this guy."

       CAT PERSPECTIVE   Last night after the neighborhood association meeting, I came home and made a chicken Caesar salad for dinner.  Anytime anyone is the kitchen, Buddy, our cat, will magically appear out of nowhere.  The back door was open and she likes to lay in the opening to enjoy the night air as she listens to the sounds of the night.  At one point, I sat down next to her and began to pet her.  The next thing I knew, I was on my back looking out the doorway and into the night.  "This is what she sees," I thought to myself as I glimpsed her little world.  The trees were black except for little patches of less dark sky peeking through the leaves.  It was interesting.

       WHAT REMIX ARE YOU?   Several weeks ago, I was thinking about the differences between remixes today and remixes of yesteryear.  In the early eighties, remixes were generally called twelve inch versions or extended version.  No one seemed to be particularly interested in the DJ who remixed the track.  Francois Kevorkian was quite well known, but it really wasn't until to the mid to late eighties that you began to see big names like Shep Pettibone, Ian Levine, Justin Strauss and Ben Liebrand.  They would take the song and keep the essence of it, but might add their own little special twist.  Remixes began to have names like "The Hellfire Mix," "Escape From New York Mix" or "The Acid House Remix."  Now days, the remixer usually receives credit in the song name, such as "Richard 'Humpty' Vission Return To The Pleasure Dome Remix."  That's a short one.  Today's remixes rarely even sound like the original song.  They are usually very long instrumental versions of the song or they will sample one portion of the song over and over.  I agree with my friend, Maggie.  I miss words.  Give me some lyrics, man!  I want to dance along to a song that I recognize.  Then I had an idea.  If I was going to give myself a remix name right now, what would it be?  So I thought about it.  Tonight, I would be "The Linda Blair Bad Girl Dub."  I've become aware that I have had some repressed anger about a particular situation and I'm feeling good that I'm allowing myself to express it and talk about it.  I say that I'm a dub because they typically do not contain all of the lyrics to the song.  Today, I feel in touch with the feeling, but I can't adequately put it in words.  What would your remix name be?

       THE CANADIANS ARE COMING   Jeff informed me that Joel and Merrideth will drive down this weekend from Canada.  I can never remember what part of Canada they are in, but I think they are in the same time zone.  They may bring their small dog with them.  Buddy should find this very interesting since she does not seem to care for any other animal life on the planet except Jeff and I.  I don't think she felt well today. She's been laying under my bed all day today.  She came out to eat dinner and then laid at my feet while I was working at the dining room table.  She did a brief stint in her cat bed, but is now back under my bed.  I haven't seen any visible signs of illness.  This evening, I spent some time in my bedroom.  I laid on my bed and watched the ceiling fan go round and round like a record baby, right round, round, round.  I really noticed the mission style light fixture.  I wondered if it fell on my in the middle of the night, would it kill me?  It's plastic, not glass, but if it got me in the righ spot, would I be a goner?  I did some spiritual reading and work this evening and it felt good.  I have been meaning to do it for several weeks now, but allowed too many other things to get in the way.  I have a sense of satisfaction.  Joel and Merrideth are to arrive on Saturday evening, which means that Jeff and I will be doing power cleaning after the home history workshop Saturday morning.  So much for waxing my car!  I wonder what Canadians eat?  Do they do South Beach?  It would be so convenient.

       YOU TOUCH MY TA-LA-LA   My friend, Tim, sent me the video for the  Ding Dong Song  by Gunther Levi and the Sunshine Girls.  It's very silly in an early 80's way.  I believe it's a Swedish group.  It also has some male nudity at the beginning.  I don't particularly find the lead singer's facial hair flattering.  Here are the lyrics:   oh, you touch my talala, mm my ding ding dong. la la la la.. Oh, you touch my talala la la la la... mm, my ding ding dong. la la la la...  Deep in the night im looking for some fun, deep in the night im loking for some love. dedededeep in the night im looking for some fun, deep in the night im looking for some...

       YOU GOTTA HAVE... FAITH?   Johnny asked me about my faith this evening.  We were sitting on the porch in our white wicker furniture.  He had an adult-refreshing beverage in his hand and Phi's dog, Taylor, lay at his feet.  Jeff was cleaning books and I had ventured out to check on him after watching the E True Hollywood Story about Whitney Houston while I clipped coupons.  I'll say it again, "She's wack!"  Johnny said that he is itching to have faith.  He wants to feel it.  He wants to believe in it.  If you could buy it at Target, he might have two bottles in his shopping cart.  How do you explain what faith is?  I suggested that first, you must be willing to be open to cultivating a relationship with God, the Universe or a Creator.  Secondly, it is a relationship that requires work each day.  You wouldn't ignore your wife each day.  You talk with her.  You share with her.  You spend time with her.  As the relationship grows, you develop trust and faith in God.  I'm not sure that this helped him.  He gave me a book that he ordered from Amazon.com about becoming a Christian.  He asked me to read it and tell him how it ends.  I told him I'd do that just as soon as I finish reading the book about the English professor who had a sex change.  He wanted to know how I could console my sexuality with my faith and I told him that he was assuming that my faith found my sexuality unacceptable, when in fact my faith celebrates my sexuality.  This threw him for a loop.  Johnny fetched his guitar and sang us a new song he wrote.  He had a dream that he was a teenage girl dying alone in a hospital.  It was so powerful that when he woke up, he was crying.  He wrote a song about it.  He started the song several times, but never finished it.  Instead, he played the music on his guitar, which was quite nice.  He showed me the lyrics.  They were sad lyrics about dying alone.  He then became embarrassed about his lyrics.  During the course of our conversation, I was baking hamburgers in the toaster oven.  I also baked some sweet potato fries.  They were both very delicious.  I have decided that I now make the best hamburger in Atlanta.  I did my reading and exercises for my Quest class for this week.  Ironically, it was about praying for others.  I think I will pray for Johnny tonight and that itch he wants to scratch so badly.

       PRAYING FOR TIME   I have never been known for saying I have too much time on my hands and lately I have been evaluating where I have been spending my time.  I volunteer for the neighborhood association as secretary, the neighborhood historical committee and the Moth Ball planning committee, which is a local fundraiser.  I also participate in the Atlanta Gay Writers group.  I volunteer for things at church from time to time as well as Image when they need volunteers for film festivals.  In addition, I try to exercise in some capacity every day, albeit I have been off somewhat this week since I think I pulled my hamstring.  I've been working out my upper body, but have tried to let my left leg recover as quickly as possible.  With work and things that need to be done around the house, it doesn't leave a whole lot of time left for me to write, work on programming the new blog and explore drawing and painting again.  I am going to be involved in Jeff's used book store to some degree.  I believe I will be managing the on-line sales, which I think will be kind of fun.  This will take some time and it has made me realize that I need to figure out what committments I need to maintain and those that I need to let go of.  Right now, writing is very important and I would like to get involved with film and video again.  At church this morning, we were discussing prayer in my Quest Class.  The book we are reading states that the best prayer is basically meditation whereby we increase our awareness of God.  I questioned how we are supposed to pray for others if this was the case and it was shared with me that in those situations we should see the divinity in those people made whole and not to focus on illness or conflict.  In other words, if someone is in the hospital, we affirm that they are already healed and recovered.  We went on to discuss that when we spend a few minutes in silence and focusing on God, that it shifts our energy and the type of experiences and people that we attract.  Some of us were concerned about the uncertainty of knowing what action to take in our lives when we are focusing on being and not doing, but I feel that if we are going down the wrong path, we will receive a feeling in prayer/meditation of which way we are supposed to go.  Ironically, I was reading a review of a book about Dante in the newspaper this morning and it stated that Dante believed that we should only have one passion that we worked toward.  Granted, that one passion should be to know God, but we usually have one gift or desire that captures our attention and we should focus on that gift or desire with all our heart and soul.  Now I just need to figure out what that one passion is for me.  I think I need to pray for more time: to do all the things I want to do; and delay making any uncomfortable decisions about what I need to let go of.

       I HAVE FOUND IT   Tony, Thom, Jeff and I went to see  urlLink Kandukondain, Kandukondain [I Have Found It]  at the  urlLink High Museum  tonight, which was presented by  urlLink Cinema India!   It was a Bollywood retelling of Jane Austen's  Sense & Sensibility  set in modern day India.  I understand that the one of the main actreses was a Ms. World and now lip syncs in Bollywood musicals.  She did a totally Natalie Wood. [Natalie Wood lip synced to another actress's vocal in  West Side Story .]    It's about two sisters who want to get married.  One sister's future husband kills himself over a white nurse in America.  She seems to be cursed and everyone always talks about what bad luck she has.  The other sister continually tries to cheer her up by bursting into song and disappearing into fields of grain and dancing around with a bunch of what appear to be native Africans and some Japanese performance artists.  Eventually, she catches the eye of a young film-maker who promises to return to marry her after he directs his first film, which is about a runaway train that cannot stop or a bomb will go off.  [Does this sound familiar?]  Meanwhile, the other sister wants to be wooed with poetry.  Instead she charms a bitter, drunken war vetran with one leg.  Enraptured with her beautiful voice, he gives her a tabula and challenges her to learn music.  She does.  However, she soons is caught in a rainstorm with a young, successful investor banker who just happened to be floating down the river singing ancient poetry.  She sprains her ankle and he carries her home, singing to her all the way.  Grandpa dies and the house is willed to the son who left him over ten years ago.  It seems grandpa had been trying to tell the ladies to open the chest in order to change the will since his daughter and granddaughters had been caring for him all of these years.  The brother and sister-in-law decide to take the house and drive their sister and nieces away to the city.  The non-singing daughter gets a job as a receptionist and soon becomes a junior programmer after finding the answers to the coding problems in the program the company had been working on for weeks.  The other sister finds her investor whose company is about to go under.  They are suddenly transported to Scotland where they sing a little ditty in kilts.  The actor looks strikingly like Phil Oakey from the Human League and the actress's facial expressions remind me of Grace from  Will & Grace .  Eventually, he marries a politician's daughter to save his company and the sister falls down a man hole and almost drowns.  Luckily, the one-legged man was in a nearby bar and saves her.  [I presume he was just having a coffee since he embraced sobriety for this girl.]  Fortunately, she had just recorded some songs before the manhole incident and she has become the next Madonna while in her coma.  Meanwhile, the young film-maker is too busy to talk to the other sister because he is making his action movie with a female action star who falls in love with him during a musical number on boat.  She asks him to drop her off at an awards show on the back of his moped and it makes all the scandal sheets.  Naturally, the girlfriend jumps to conclusions and decides to transfer to the American office.  At the same time, the one-legged man tries to fix up the singing sister with a buff water polo star who seems to be the only man who knows how to use a razor in this movie.  She rejects him and confesses her love for the unidexter.  The film-maker finishes his movie and returns to marry the sister whose bags are packed for California.  She cries and will not let him in because he changed the name of the movie she picked out because he thought it would bring him bad luck.  He goes outside and sees her on the balcony.  He asks her to marry him and incredibly she finally lightens up and says, "Yes."  The sisters get married.  Roll credits.  I enjoyed the movie.  On the way out, we shared an elevator with three Indians.  I asked if they liked the movie and they said yes.  They asked if I thought the movie was long.  I told them I didn't find any movie long after the last  Lord Of The Rings  movie.  A long uncomfortable silence followed and then we all got off the elevator.

       A NIGHT ON THE TOWN WITH THE BOYS   Last night Kiki, Shawn and I went to dinner at The King And I restaurant.  It's a Thai restaurant and I had some great mango chicken, which sounds like some wild and wacky dance from the 50's.  "More tequila please!"    We ran into my good friend, Ryan, which I have not had the opportunity to get to know as much as I like.  We had been planning to go get some coffee.  He'd sent his phone number to me and when I tried to reply back with mine, my e-mails kept being returned as undeliverable.  I thought to myself, "Great Scott!  I've been spaminated!"  In actuality, I think it's probably a server issue.  I never bothered to call Ryan because I kept thinking that it would clear up soon and I kept trying periodically.  In the end, I gave him my phone number at the restaurant.  I also had the pleasure of meeting his very polite friend whose name escapes me due to the onset of my short-term memory loss.  "Color me Dory!"  After dinner, we piled into Shawn's Volvo and headed to  urlLink Compound  for the swimwear fashion show that Kiki's friend, Eric, was in.  Kiki is an aspiring fashion designer and Eric was one of his models for one of his fashion shows.  Eric seems fascinated by Kiki's gayness.  From what Kiki has told me, I gather that it's sort of like  urlLink Lion Country Safari  where you drive the park and look at the baboons, but without the safety of a window.  Kiki picked up copies of  urlLink David Magazine  for all of us with Eric on the cover.  It's a new design and look for the magazine and the fundraiser was coinciding with the launch of  David' s new look.   "What am I supposed to do with this?" I asked.  "We'll take them with us when we go back stage to see Eric!"  "I'm not asking for an autograph."   As a side note, I have to say that Shawn has good musical taste.  We listened to Tom Jones, Xymox and Sunscreem during the course of the evening.  That said, we'll return back to our story.  We arrived at Compound and decided to do valet parking due to the urban wasteland quality of the surrounding area.  We pulled up in the parking lot; a tattooed boy in a windbreaker ran out, got in the car, turned the steering wheel and drove it four feet into a parking space.  He handed the keys back to Shawn and Kiki and I paid the guy $7.00.  It felt like valet-lite.  We walked to the club and I had to tell the boys not to walk so fast with my pulled hamstring.  "Hey! Hey! Hey!  Wait up for Tiny Tim, will ya!"  We waited in line and I noticed that the girl working the velvet rope used to own the salon where Randy cut my hair.  She seemed really happy doing what she's doing now, which I imagine is exactly what she should be doing, if anything could really make her happy.  She has perfected the look of the nonplussed Asian-American girl.  In the brief moments I have interacted with her, she was always pleasant, but seemed as if she would be happier somewhere else.  If that was my personality, I would invest in one of those butterfly vibrators that you can wear all day long - while at the office, the tennis court, dancing, ironing, etc.  At least it would make me feel that even though I'm doing things for other people, I'm still doing something for myself as well.  It's a win-win situation.  A feisty redhead welcomed us to club.  "Are you virgins?" She asked with great half-interest.  "Why yes," I replied. "Do we get to be thrown into the volcano?"  Unfortunately, there was no volcano, but it was a fantastic piece of architecture.  There is a little covered area when you walk in.  Then it becomes an open courtyard with a fountain/cement pond.  There are little Eastern stone bridges over little rock streams. Blue lights are everywhere.  If I was a pharmaceutical salesman, I would hold all my meetings about antidepressants there.  Inside there is a kitchen with an island/counter proceeding out from one wall.  It serves as a bar.  There is an open living room with video of waves crashing on the shore projected on each wall.  We sat down on modern chairs that were made out of that can cuzi material.  It cupped your body so that you leaned way back and your legs sort of splayed apart.  It was very  Sex And The City  as well as perfect for an OBGYN.    There was a brooding Latin guy nursing a longneck across from me.  He kept looking at me the whole time.  I smiled once at him in an effort to be friendly, but it seemed to produce some reaction in him that may have been lust or rage.  Having produced a completely opposite effect than I had wanted, I decided it might be best to look at what was going on around me.  I was amazed at the number of people who looked absolutely plastic.  I'm not exaggerating.  They looked airbrushed.  I thought I sort stuck out with my tan shorts and Charlie Brown-style shirt, but I didn't really care.  I was also impressed with the number of people my own age and older that I saw out because you hear all the time about how when gay men get older they disappear into the suburbs.  I think Atlanta has a very active mid-life generation.  Granted, it wasn't a club per se, but more of a bar with atmosphere and music.  The music was rather lively.  Everything sounded like a Robbie Rivera diskofied version of theme songs from 70's TV shows.  My favorite was the Stardust-inspired version of the theme from  The Price Is Right .    Shortly after we arrived, we found Dave and Stuart.  I've known them both since I moved to Atlanta on May 16, 1996.  Dave was one member of the infamous  David Posse  that my co-workers joked about.  I had five different friends named David at the same time and they were referred to as David 1, David 2, David 3, David 4 and David 5.  When my co-workers asked what I did for the weekend, it was always interesting.  I met Dave on a water skiing trip and I remember admiring his chest and wishing mine was that perky.  Stuart accosted me at a pool party for reading someone's tarot cards for fun.  I thought they were going to have to put him in a straight jacket.  I have gone on several hiking trips with  urlLink Wilderness Network of Georgia  since then and have had a very pleasant time with him.  At one point, I wandered around by myself and ran into an old boyfriend.  I can't say that we ever dated in the traditional sense.  We went to dinner and movies at times, but our relationship was primarily a physical one.  It was like two kids playing together and exploring their bodies and pushing the boundaries.  There was a sense of fun and delight to it.  However, we never really had much else in common on which to base a relationship.  It was casual.  I suppose it was a serial hook-up in today's vernacular.  Anyway, he looked good and is doing well.  He always smiles so big at me that I can't help but smile back.  We still have a connection, but it's hard to describe what it is.  I assume it has to do with the fact that we have very good memories attached to one another.  We're both in relationships now, but he has paired himself with someone without much of a sex drive.  He asked me if Jeff and I are monogamous and I told him we were.  He asked if this was Jeff's decision and I told him it was a decision we made together.  However, my choice to honor that commitment is my own.  He asked me if I thought less of him for suggesting it.  I told him no.  I was flattered and he and his boyfriend needed to do what worked best for them and if that included an open relationship, so be it.  He kissed my cheek, hugged me tight and then slipped away into the sea of faces.  I saw him look back once and he was gone.  I caught up with the guys in the building in the back.  There were 19 flat panel monitors on the wall.  We couldn't figure out if they were real or if the images were projected on them.  If they were real, the cost was staggering.  They were showing underwater footage that had to be computer-generated.  The camera perspective on the swordfish was too perfect.  No diver could have kept up with it.  After waiting until 11:00pm, the show finally started and I turned my attention away from the hair on the guy beside me.  I was fascinated by its ability to defy gravity.  Since the show was running so late, I reached in my pocket to call Jeff, but realized I had left my cell phone on my desk when I went to check on the cat before I left.  All night long, I thought I could feel it vibrating in my pocket like amputees who can feel the pain of extremities that are no longer there.  Eric came out and strutted his stuff down the runway.  If ever I suspected his was gay, it would be from the way he works the stage.  He was in touch with his  Inner Diva .  I don't mean in a bitchy way, but in an in control way.  He shifted his weight.  He spun around like Michael Jackson.  He sashayed and he shartayed.  He did it all and the crowd ate it up.  I had forgotten just how huge he was.  He's very tall and just built.  He has huge shoulders and arms and legs and tiny waist.    I was very concerned about the models walking in flip flops because it seemed like they would be hard to walk in, but no one fell.  At one point, a drag queen came and stood in front of me and almost wiped me out with her wig.  I was almost done in by the overpowering smell of her hairspray.  Soon the show was over and I waited while the boys went back stage to say hello to Eric.  It was too crowded for me.    Everyone had fun and Kiki made a professional contact.  "You need to hurry up and become famous so we can meet Ashley Judd," I told him.  As we walked out I asked Shawn if he wanted me to go get the car so that he could at least feel that it was truly valet parking.  He considered, but then said it wasn't necessary as we walked off into the night.  "Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait up for the lame boy!"

       HOW DO I FEEL?   This week has been a strange week.  I have felt like a Japanese  Godzilla  film.  I feel somewhat out-of-sync with the world as if other people's lips move and then the sound follows shortly after.  It's not good or bad.  It just is.  I've become quite comfortable with that concept as of late.  Careerwise, I have felt somewhat as if everything I have done has been a struggle this week. I finally found a program and a rate that made my client happy and then contract fell through.  Now they are looking for a new house.  It's not the end of the world, but I had everything set.  I had a feeling of accomplishment.  If I believed in curses, I would say that I'm living under one that delays every loan I work on.  However, I don't believe in curses.  My other loan that has been pending since March will finally close Friday.  I know my customer will be happy.  It's been a trial at times for him.  It will be nice to be paid too.  I'm going with Kiki (that sounds sooo gay) and Shawn to see Eric model at some bar near the King Plow Art Center.  Kiki said Eric will be on the cover of  urlLink David Magazine  too.  He's a nice kid.  I won't be home until 11:00pm and I haven't had a nap today to recover from waking up at 5:00am.  After the PowerCore meeting, I finally had some time to reorganize my desk.  It had gotten out of hand.  Order and balance are important in my life.    There is so much I want to do, but I just don't feel very motivated do anything.  I feel half-focused on everything.  I think I may just need sleep.

       CONNECTIONS   With each passing year, I come to believe with more certainty that things happen in our lives for a reason.   This afternoon, I was feeling somewhat affected by a general weirdness in the office.  Things have been tense lately.  I'm not sure of all of the details.  Our appointment with the realtor in North Canadian Georgia was canceled.  I prepared for my meeting with the condo client.  I finally found a way to make the numbers work, but the rate was 7%.  I knew she was rate sensitive, but with her amount of debt and the adjustments for a high rise condo, this was the best I could do.  As I was driving to the appointment, I started paying attention to how I was feeling and I discovered a great well of doubt.  This confused me somewhat because I have been feeling as things have been going well.  I started speculating if I was in the right profession.  I called Jeff to hear his voice to get me back on track.  We spoke for a few minutes and he reminded me that in every line of work, there are good days and bad days.  I got off the phone determined to go in there and give my best.  If I got the loan, great.  If not, what have I really lost?  It then dawned on me that perhaps the purpose of this appointment was not to get the loan, but the experience.  This seemed to make my  inner ding  go off.    I met the client.  She was very charming and had a beautiful office.  We went over her credit report and she began telling me which debts should be included and which ones should not.  When I asked why, she told me that the company pays these debts.  When I asked why the company would pay these personal debts she replied that the funds were used for the company.  I asked her again if she was self-employed.  She said no.  Why then, I asked, would she use personal funds for the company.  She replied that she owned the business.  I qualified her position as self-employed, but she corrected me.  She didn't seem to get the concept that to own a company is to be self-employed.  The remainder of the appointment continued along the same lines.  She told me my rate was too high even though I showed her the rate sheet and explained how I arrived at the rate.  It would be interesting to know what rate she finally ends up with.  In my opinon, she shouldn't buy the condo to begin with.  She already has too much debt.  In the end, she complimented me on my work and professional manner and she was a pleasure to meet.  Perhaps I will hear from her again, but her accounting still makes me quiver.  I was reading  urlLink Mindful Threads  tonight and Gregory wrote about throwing away old momentos.  Joan and I had a conversation tonight about letting go of things we no longer needed, which reminded me of the connection theory.  It's got me thinking.

       READY, SET, GO!   It seems as if every second of my day has been filled lately.  Business seems to be good after my dry spell where all of my closings were pushed back a month.  New loans and opportunities are coming to me.  It's taking a little more effort to keep balanced.  I got a good night's sleep last night and went over to Kiki's house in Inman Park to swim.  The official Inman Park Pool is behind the townhome he shares with, I guess I will call him Didi since I have been instructed to use these ridiculous code names.  We went to the locker room and I slipped into the trusty Speedo.  I bought a new one last year because the old one had worn out and I was quite shocked when I got out of the water and there was no imagination left to what was between my legs.  The new Speedo is very modest.  It gives the impression of being as unisex as a stick of a gum.  Although  International Male  may seem a very different impression, the purpose of a Speedo is to allow you to swim without drag and not simply optic foreplay.  It was a bit chilly this morning and I slid into the water slowly.  Once I was in and moving, it wasn't bad.  The lessons from last night were a bit foggy.  I'll have to review them again, but I found the strokes and drills from last summer coming back to me. I found my "sweet spot" easily and I must say I could probably continue with that drill all day.  It's not tiring in the least.  It really does feel like I am moving effortlessly through the water.  The Slimfins are awesome.  I have never had such a great pair of fins.  They make you work your legs more and provide more control.  They are also much smaller and actually fit in my gym bag.  I'm meeting Karen for lunch today and then driving to North Canadian Georgia to meet a realtor in a subdivision with Carol Lynn and Robert.  I hope it's productive.  I am supposed to meet my client with the condo in the afternoon to take an application.  I need to do my research on that Wells Fargo loan that doesn't exist this morning.  I hate it when unethical mortgage people sell rates and programs that don't actually exist.  They think once they get them in the office, they can talk them into another program and rate and then they refuse.  the continue to wander around the moors lookly for a ghostly sign of this mythical rate and loan program.  All in all, it's a good exercise in staying focused on purpose and not judging or whining.  See ya later, sports fans!

       I REBUKE THEE, MONDAY   What a day!  I met with the realtor in my PowerCore group this morning for coffee.  She is married to a mortgage broker so she doesn't give mortgage leads, but we got to know each other a little bit and came up with some other ways we can work together.  We found that we actually share a lot of the same values.  I went by Barnes & Noble to look at some books on SQL & PHP before my lunch meeting.  I skimmed through a few that answered some questions I have.  I need to contact my Web hosting service.  I went to lunch with the insurance guy from my PowerCore group.  I have a good idea of all the different services he offers.  He explained how people cash out life insurance policies today.  It was quite interesting.  We are all way too under insured.  I came home and looked through the pre-qualifications I received from several of the lenders I sent the application and credit report from Friday.  I was actually suprised the rates were so low.  The client thought they were high.  I have one more lender I'm expecting a pre-qual from tomorrow.  I received a lead from a client purchasing a condo for half a million.  She was very pleasant.  I pulled credit after I got off the phone with her and she has a lot of debt. Most lenders will not approve a loan if your monthly debts are over 50% of your monthly gross income and this client makes quite a bit of money.  There are adjustments on the rate because (a) it's a condo, (b) it's over five stories tall, (c) the loan amount is over $333,000 and is referred to as a "jumbo," and (d) we'll probably have to state her income instead of showing income on the loan application.  Evidently she seems to know something that I don't because she told me that wasn't correct.  We're supposed to meet tomorrow.  This should be interesting.  I quit working about 8:00pm and went to the gym. The little red-haired girl was there and she handed me a towel as I walked in.  I almost said to her, "Oh you nasty girl," but I didn't.  I did an upper body workout.  I pulled a muscle in my leg last week and I've finally stopped limping.  It feels much better, but I thought it was better to refrain from doing my leg workout for another two days.  When I left, the little red-haired girl smiled at me again.  For some reason, it makes me smile in spite of myself.  Maybe she's making me straight.  "We want you!  We want you!  We want you as a new recruit!"  I came home and caught up on a few of the blogs.  I really haven't had time to read them lately.  I never read Spam Poetry.  I think I should remove her from my honor roll. It's nothing against her. I just think I should give someone else some attention now.  I think I may remove Belle De Jour too.  She doesn't blog much anymore and I forget to check her.  I went over to Kiki's house and we watched the  Total Immersion  video on Freestyle and backstroke.  It's a fascinating concept for learning Masters swimming.  It's all about getting slippery in the water and being more fish-like.  This week, we are working on finding our balance in the water and then our "sweet spot," which is a place of perfect balance and comfort in the water.  There is one guy in the video who has the body that I want.  He is lean and fit and has a tattoo.    Kiki and I are meeting at the pool at 7:45am tomorrow to swim.  I don't like cold water.  I must approach in three stages: submerge to testicle level; submerge to nippled level; and finally, head under water.  I suppose "rudder man" will be there.  He's a nice guy, but he always starts to get an erection next to me in the showers when we are alone.  Fortunately, I just start asking him how work is going or how his kids are and he deflates.  He can't talk and be aroused at the same time.  I find that it gives me a sense of control over at least some aspect of my life.  Kiki doesn't help the situation.  One morning I left my shampoo in the shower and had to go back into the shower.  It's very awkward reaching around Kiki as he is performing oral sex on rudder man.  Furthermore, it's one of those social settings where you don't know where to look.  What experience do you have in this department?  It's not like there is a Norman Rockwell painting to refer back to for guidance like "Rusty Inspires The Football Team On The 50-Yard Line" or "Johnny Shows His Team Spirit."  Another friend says that I attract these situations.  "Maybe you get something out of it."  Safe to say that I was able to retrieve my shampoo before I actually did get something out of it.  I am sure it would have washed off, but I prefer that people keep bodily fluids and appendages to themselves, thank you very much.

       I AM SO EMBARRASSED   I was reading Gregory's blog,  urlLink Mindful Threads , this afternoon.  He posted his answers to one of those e-mails with all the questions.  Question 16 was where you own a home if you could own one in any place in the world.  Gregory answered Sydney, Australia.  Now, anyone who knows me knows that I have been planning to own a condo there since I first visited in 2001.  When I read it, a strange gay sound issued forth from my mouth.  It was unlike anything I have ever uttered before.  I looked around me and found myself alone.  The cat was outside.  I felt very embarrassed and I think I may have turned red.

       MOTHER'S DAY IN REVIEW   Last night Donald, my friend from Art School, came over with his girlriend, Julie.  I love Donald and Julie.  They are two of my most favorite straight people in the world.  In fact, they are two of my favorite people in the world in general.  If I had a brother, I would want him to be like Donald.  He's just a really nice guy.  He kind of reminds me of Jeff in that they both are always eager to help other people and do the right thing.  We went to Six Feet Under, the little fish pub across from historic Oakland Cemetery, and had dinner.  The night was beautiful and we had a nice dinner and a lovely conversation.  This morning Jeff and I got up and made a salad to take to lunch at his parents' house. I went to church and then drove down to the south side.  We had a nice lunch and sat around the table laughing and enjoying ourselves.  They really do seem like my family.  I really like them and I guess they like me too.  I sometimes wonder how they would feel if they knew about my relationship with Jeff.  Part of me thinks they have to suspect a little at least, but then sometimes denial can do amazing things.  Jeff is not comfortable sharing this part of his life with them.  I knew that from the beginning and I accept that.  I got back home about five o'clock and read the Sunday paper and a manuscript a friend is working on about her abusive ex-husband and chronic fatigue syndrome.    I spent an hour working on the new blog and the whole mySQL and PHP may take a little more research than I have time to put into it right now. I may have to reschedule this for June.  I'm a little disappointed, but I'm doing a much better job of setting my priorities these days.  I need to spend some time working on the screenplay this week so I may just do one post a day each day.

       CHANGING PERCEPTIONS   My friend, Charles, sent me  urlLink this link , which refers to a conversation we had last week regarding gay Asian men being down on the gay desirability food chain.  The threads on this link seem to imply that gay Asian men are soft, submissive and effeminate.  This seems strange to me because one of the first gay Asian Americans I knew was very masculine and proactive.  I believe that if we choose to accept certain beliefs, we will continue to draw experiences to us that affirm those beliefs.  However, if we choose to reject these beliefs, we must replace them with a new belief.  Therefore, we must have a clear idea of what beliefs we want to manifest for ourselves.  Therefore, if Charles chooses to create new beliefs about how he will be perceived as a gay Asian American, he must have a clear idea of how he wants to be perceived.  What are your thoughts on this theory?

       WIDE OPEN SPACES   Today we finished painting the newly patched hole in the ceiling where the leak from the upstairs shower was.  Jeff repainted the entire wall.  The hardwoods have been mopped with Murphy's oil.  The furniture has been moved back in place.  I'm shocked at the amount of room in the den now.  It almost feels like a ball room.  It fills me with hope and possibility.    Jeff was frustrated today by the amount of things he feels he needs to do.  He made a few comments today that were not very loving.  He didn't mean them. He was just frustrated, but in the sting of the remark, you can't help wonder what really lurks in the wide open spaces between those comments.  You can drive yourself crazy analyzing these situations, but I decided a long time ago to be strong, hold my head high and say, "Fuck it!"  My stoic response was to fold his laundry, take it upstairs and put it away.  Getting angry never solves anything.  He didn't mean it.  As a result, we had a very nice evening.  We human beings are funny creatures.

       PERFECT TIMING   So Tacy calls tonight and she asks, "Do you remember that story you told me about Louise Hay last month?"  "Which one?"  "The one where she looked for an apartment for six months when she moved to L.A., but she couldn't find anything she liked.  When she finally did, she found out that the builder had just broken ground on her perfect apartment when she moved to L.A.  It wasn't ready for her when she started looking."  "Yeah, I remember that.  I think about that story a lot when I feel anxious about trying to make something happen."  "Well, I applied for a promotion."  "Terrific!"  "Remember the new GLBT group at my company that I told you about?"  "Didn't you go to the first meeting last month?"  "Yes, I did.  I was asked to share my coming out story at this month's meeting.  I started talking about Kim being in D.C. and me being here.  Well, the CEO of our company came to the meeting as the keynote speaker and after listening to my story, he told me, 'There is no reason with today's techonology why you and your family should be separated.'  I don't know what he did, but I got the promotion.  I'll work in Chicago four days a week and then fly to D.C. Thursday night and work from home on Friday."  "Tacy, that's fantastic!  I'm so happy for you."  "There's more.  Kim and I have had some good heart to heart talks over the past month and we've worked things out.  In fact, she's going to come out to her family over the Memorial Day Weekend."  "Wow.  That's huge.  What brought this on?"  "I told her that I can't be just a roommate after nine years and she agreed."  "Wow.  Are you going to be there with her when she tells her family?"  "I will if she wants me to.  I'll support her in whatever way I can.  Hey!  Why don't y'all come up for July 4th to D.C.?"  "Jeff will be on his missionary trip, but I think I might be able to come up for that."  "That would be awesome."  "Damn straight!"  "You know, you were right."  "What do you mean?"  "When I was down because I couldn't find a job in D.C., you said that maybe it's because the right job wasn't available yet and maybe it was being created."  "Ooh... I did say that, didn't I?"  "That's exactly what happened.  It also gave Kim and I time to think and talk about our relationship.  I'm not sure if we would still be together if we hadn't had this time apart."  Silence.  "Are you still there?"  "Yeah.  I'm just taking it all in.  It's pretty amazing when you think about it.  I mean, the way the Universe works."  "I am so thankful.  Everything happened in the perfect time and in the perfect way."  "Your good fortune inspires me to believe that the same thing will happen with some things I'm waiting on too."  "It'll happen man."  "I'm glad y'all worked things out.  I didn't want my favorite lesbians splitting up.  At least not before y'all go to work at the chocolate factory."  "You're crazy!"  "Yeah."

       DELIGHTFUL, DELOVELY, DECLUTTER   I have made some progress with my desk and bedroom, but I still have these papers that I'm shuffling through and boxes of stuff that I don't know what to do with.  Some of the papers and some of the items in the box I need to keep, but I must find a place for them.  I've been devoting an hour to this process each day, but I wish it would go faster.  I'm very dedicated to my "power hour."  I keep thinking that I would be so much happier if my life were much simplier and sparser.  Why can't I be a monk in Sri Lanka and just have a begging bowl and an umbrella and be happy with that?  Instead, I received the GLX-2800, which will allow me to digitize my vinyl and cassette collection.  It's an attractive little mixer and it will indeed allow me to release some of the excess vinyl and cassettes that I have, but it's still one more thing that I own now that takes up space.  Does the physical clutter in my life reflect the mental clutter of negative thinking and false beliefs that are sprinkled about my mind?  I sometimes close my eyes and picture myself in loose fitting cotten pants and a matching top, perhaps in a flattering, serene cyan, and closely cropped hair.  I wander about the ashram meditating here, meditating there.  I focus on my breathing and I don't feel any regret that Kylie Minogue's third single from  Body Language  will be one of my least favorite songs of all.  It doesn't disturb my inner peace.  A friend called this evening.  During the course of the conversation, he asked, "Should I shave all of my pubic hair off again?"  "Hmmm... that seems like a person decision.  I cannot make that for your grasshopper."  "I know, but it's a lot of work."  He inhaled on his cigarette and then exhaled.  "I just feel so much neater with a smooth dick and balls."  "Doesn't it irritate you when the hair starts to grow back in?"  "No," he replys incredulously as if it never occured to him that anyone would ask so stupid a question.  "It makes me feel in control and like everything is in order in my life."  The strength of his reply was so assured, that for a moment, I contemplated marching to the bathroom to grab my razor, but I was distracted by an orange on the way.

       BONDING OVER BEIGNETS   I met Holly and Larry from my PowerCore group at  urlLink Crescent City Beignets  this morning for breakfast.  The purpose of our meeting was to get to know each other and find out more specifics about our professions and the clients we are looking for.  The big joke was that today was  urlLink International No Diet Day .  Somehow I ordered three beignets.  I was hoping Holly might eat one, but she just drank water.  Damn her holistic hide!  At first, we just started to get to know one another.  Holly is a massage therapist at a yoga facility.  She looks as if she came from Minnesota with her fair skin and blonde hair.  She seems "all natural."  Larry is an older fellow.  He has a dark complexion and glasses and looks as if he should be running a business in New York.  We began talking about business and at some point during the conversation, I let out my inner talk show host and began asking some very directed questions.  What kind of conditions can you treat with massage that most people would not think about?  When a customer comes to you for service, what should they expect?  What's it like to do business with you?  What kind of customers do you like working with?  What's your favorite thing about your job?  At one point during our meeting, I looked up at Larry and then back at Holly and you could tell in their eyes that we were all cognizant of something magical going on.  We were connecting on levels that went beyond business and we found some commonalities in spite of all of our differences.  It was a very pleasant feeling.

       ONCE UPON A SUMMER....   Last night I remembered being 12 years old.  We lived in Waco and it was one of my favorite summers between 6th and 7th grade.  We lived in a house on Bellaire Drive, but for some reason I refused to spell it correctly.  I think I spelled it Belair because that is the way it was spelled on a box of frozen fish fillets that I saw each week in the freezer at Safeway.  For the longest time, I wasn't allowed to ride my bike any further than up and down my block.  Eventually I expanded my territory to the full lenth of the street, but there was an invincible force field that would not allow me to venture onto our neighboring streets.  In the summer of 1980, I broke through that barrier.  I began riding my mother's bike, which was a masculine looking three-speed, and I was exhilerated as I rode down Topeka Street as fast as I could.  At some point, my friend, Kurt, and I rode over to the edge of the neighborhood where they were building new houses.  There were fields of giant sunflowers there.  I had never seen sunflowers like this before and I wanted to get off my bike and run through them, but I couldn't leave my mother's bike on the side of the road by itself.  Plus, the dark, thick interior of sunflower stalks was intimidating.  What might lurk in there?    Sometimes we would ride up to the 7-11 and get a slurpee.  I bought my first chocolate chip cookie/ice cream sandwich there.  It was a time of Star Wars trading cards and Pop Rocks.  There were trails near our house and I used to love to run up and down them in the woods.  It was an adventure.  Sometimes we used to cut through them while walking home from school.  One day we found some pages from an adult magazine there.  It was a woman with long dark hair and a dark-haired man with a moustache.  The woman shaved his moustache off and then there was a picture of her supposedly shaving his pubic hair off.  It was all very softcore.  The text talked about shaving his nether regions and it made me go home and look it up in the dictionary.  Therefore, I can truly say it was an educational experience.  The pictures made me feel funny, but I was unable to put my finger on what it was that I felt.  I had nothing to compare it too yet.  We threw the pages away to prevent younger kids from finding it.  We thought we were doing a good thing, but I thought about those pages from time to time over the summer.  Most of all, I remember the big mimosa tree in our front yard.  In the early part of summer, the skies became very beautiful.  Huge rolling clouds could be seen in the sky in various shades of peach, pink and purple.  They would roll in from down the street where Lake Waco was.  I used to think they were reflections of the waves from the coast frozen as reflections in the sky.  I would sit in the tree and watch the clouds for hours.

       EARLY MORNING   I woke up at 5:30am for this week's PowerCore meeting.  In spite of my fear that I will sleep through the alarm, I don't seem to have a problem waking up or arriving on time.  The meeting went well.  The members got a kick out of my sexy mortgages.  It may be my new tag line.  I had breakfast with Dr. J., the chiropractor and Mike, the actor and motivational speaker.  I'm having coffee and lunch with a lot of people between now and the next meeting so we can know more about what we each do.  I prefer coffee to lunch.  It's more flexible.  Besides, I don't like people to watch me eat in a business setting.  It kind of makes me feel like one of those Iraqui prisoners forced to masturbate before female soldiers.    It's been a busy day.  I went into the office for awhile and did some research.  Carol Lynn and Bonnie loved my affinity program letter and they are going to use it also.  Tuesday, Carol Lynn, Robert and I are driving to North Canadian Georgia to meet with a realtor in a subdivision.  I think one of us is going to be in the subdivision at all times to get the loan business.  I'm waiting for more details, but I'm concerned about how many days a week I will have to be there, specifically on weekends.  There isn't much flexibility with just two people.  I feel like I've been up forever.

       INSPIRATION FROM THE ODDEST PLACES   I received the new issue of  Entertainment Weekly  on Saturday and was looking through it while I ate lunch.  It's one of my guilty pleasures.  It's the only way that I appear to know about  Friends  even though I never watch TV.  There was an interesting article in there about Dr. Sharon Mitchell, a former porn star and drug addict.  After being attacked by a crazed fan in 1996, she went back to school and got her PhD in human sexuality and opened the Adult Industry Medical Health Foundation (AIM).  After porn actor, Darren James, and porn actress, Lara Roxx, recently tested positve for HIV, she was able to halt production of adult movies for 60-days in the Los Angeles area.    First, it's nice to know that the adult film industry has some measures in place to try and prevent the spread of HIV among its actors.  More amazingly, I am surprised that it has been as successful as it has until this major outbreak, which nothing of its kind has happened since 1998.  Still, it's good to know that something is in place instead of nothing at all.  Still, you would think they would require condom use at all times.  Secondly, I think it's very inspiring that a woman who has slipped away into stripping in clubs to support her heroin habit, is beaten so badly, it sends her a wake up call that something has got to change.  What does she do?  She goes back to school for the training she needs to help others from her former industry.  Some of the services she has extended to clients include: birth control; drug and alcohol counseling; information on how to get in and out of the porn industry safely; scholarship program; medical checkups; and STD screenings.  Many people may have felt that there was no point in bettering themselves because they were too old and too set in their ways to change.  It's too hard.  Why bother?    I was reading an essay in Michal Thomas Ford's My Big Fat Queer Life and it had something to do with how silly porn was.  He mentioned the deaths of Joey Stefano, who I knew died of a drug overdose, and Ryan Idol, who fell or was pushed out of the window of his Manhattan hotel.  This sounded very mysterious so I decided to research it a little.  As it turns out, Ryan survived the fall from his fourth story window.  It's actually an amazing story.  He landed on an awning that broke his fall and he was so drunk that it distributed the impact more evenly through out his body.   urlLink Here  is an interesting article I found about the incident, his stage career and opinions on how he may or may not be using the gay community.  I've never been a big fan of porn.  I've always felt it is sort of like alcohol.  When used in moderation, it can be enjoyed by some people.  However, with excessive use, it can destroy lives.  In the late 80s and early 90s, my best friend, Kent, had a msyterious porn collection.  I would go over to his apartment and he would have stacks of gay porn magazines.  It was then that I learned the significance of Cyndi Lauper looking at the pages of a  Blue Boy  magazine in  She-Bop , the world's greatest anthem on the right for maturbation tolerance.  Knowing that he was a college student like myself, I knew he didn't have the money to buy all of these.  The magazines weren't cheap.  He said that friends gave them to him.  I never met those friends and always wondered about who they were and what exchange may have transpired for these magazines.   Ken would hand me several magazines to puruse as he finished getting ready to go out.  They're really not doctor's office or hair salon reading material, are they?  I mean the purpose of porn is to titilate with the expectation that one is going to manually self-stimulate oneself.  It's not like you're going to whip it out at the doctor's office and go to town or tell your hair dresser, "Oh, let me just switch my Butterly vibrator off.  I was picking up some good vibrations."  Furthermore, when I venture into any territory outside my upbringing, my mother's voice usually accompanies me.  As you flip through the pages and you see some smooth model type with a big grin on his face as he holds his legs up in the air to expose his perky and pink anus, the only thing I can think of is, "You know, he can never run for political office now."  My mother's voice says, "What would his mother think?"  Granted, I think at one time or another, we've all wondered what it would be like to runaway and do something wild like pose nude for a photographer or buy toothpaste without out a coupon, but we know we would never do it.  I'm not ashamed of my body, but it doesn't necessarily warrant that I present my spinchter to the world for general viewing.  Plus, I don't particurlarly want my mom and dad to see my genitals on parade, thank you very much.  On the other hand, I read an interview with porn actor is some local periodical about how his mother runs his fan club and helps hime choose which nude pictures to submit to magazines.     "Which picture do you like best Ma?  The cowboy, the biker or the all American boy-next-door?"    "I like the all American one.  You've got a bigga hard-on."   So there was one particulary magazine that I actually liked to read.  I think it was called Man Shots and they had interviews with the directors and actors as well as pictures.  Kent would always tease me for reading the articles, but I thought they were fascinating.  I had no idea how huge the porn industry is in the United States, let alone the rest of the world.  It is a well organized, finely tuned machine.  It was enlightening to discover what a director looks for in an actor/model and what reasons led some performers to get involved in the industry.  Sadly, Kent's porn collection is gone.  I went to visit him when his sick once and staying with his mother.  As I was leaving, he said he wanted to return my box of books.  I told him that he didn't have any of my books.  He expressed with much emphasis that he did indeed have some of my books.  I suddenly understood that I was to be the care taker of his porn while he was living at home.  My friend, Tacy, had gone with me to visit Kent.  As we drove away, I rifled through the box and was amazed at the collection.  It had all changed.  There were movies too.  For some reason, Chip Off The Old Block sounds familiar.  The box remained with me for several years.  In fact, at one point, it was even in my parents' attic in storage.  I eventually through it all away.  At one point, I was going to cut all of the erect penises out and write a poem with them on a canvas.  Sadly, it never happened.  I don't own any porn and I sometimes feel like a cowboy without a horse.  How can I be a gay man without porn?  I've often flirted with the idea of buying a movie just to keep around the house in case I ever decide I want to watch it.  The idea of just knowing it's there in case I want to watch it soothes me, but trying to pick out a particular title among the thousands of titles gives me a headache.  I'm very particular about the regular movies I own, I would imagine I would be even more specific with a blue movie.  In the end, I can't say that I have missed anything over the years.  In closing, I did find an  urlLink interesting Web site  in my research for Ryan Idol last night.  It's a site that lists deceased porn stars and how they died.  It seems like many of them left this mortal coil in some most unpleasant ways.  I don't know the numbers for regular actors in the porn industry, but the ratio of deaths by tragic circumstances may be small in comparison to the number of actors as a whole.  However, I would say that in an industry where drug and alcohol use are common, it does not seem surprising.  As I read the names and the circumstances of death,  I found myself pitying these people, but then I changed my mind.  Don't we all face challenges no matter who we choose to spend time with or which profession we go into.  Whether it's learning to tell our boss to get his or her own coffee extracting ourselves from the clutches of a craze fan who is beating the crap out of us, they are all opportunities for growth and it is what we make of those opportunities that counts.

       I, CHANGELING   "I washed that outer curtain that you wanted washed."  "Yeah, but you put other clothes on top of it and now it's wrinkled."  So I start laughing because he usually has a constructive comment for everything.  He really means well, but there is no positive comment in front of it to soften the blow so it just comes across as annoying to me.  "Why are you laughing."  "Because you fill me full of joy."  "Yeah, right.  You're making fun of me."  He reached around me to pour some lotion on his hands.  "I'm enjoying you," I said, as I walked out of the bathroom.  The door swung closed behind me.  "Hey, I can't open the door.  I have lotion on my hands."  "I can't hear you!" I called up to him as I descended the stairs.

       THE WEEKEND IN REVIEW   As I sit here, I'm trying to think back to what I did this weekend.  I know that I worked Friday and then met Jeff at the gym.  We had a  urlLink Poblano Pesto Burrito  at Qdoba Grill afterwards.  We came home and then did things around the house.  I attacked my old personal files and threw out a lot of old documents.  Saturday, we got up late.  I guess it was 9am.  Jeff and I decided on recipes for the Progressive Dinner Party.  I started laundry and went for a run around the park.  I put lunch in the oven and took a shower.  I cleaned out the refrigerator.  I threw out some things that I'm not sure Jeff would have allowed me throw out had he been there.  I will say this: I threw out some things so old that they in our refrigerator the last time Justin was in Britney.  That's all I'm going to say.  My cleaning spree continued.  I helped Jeff load books into the truck to take to a storage facility until he has enough to lease a space.  At some point, we received a phone call that Joel & Merredith would not be coming this week.  They are in the process of selling Joel's late father's business and there has been a delay.  I'm not sure when they are coming now, but we got a lot of cleaning done that needed to be done.  We kept cleaning.  I shreded some more old documents.  We went to Virginia Highlands and had dinner at  urlLink Everybody's Pizza  and then went by  urlLink Publix  to pick up ingredients for the Progressive Dinner Party items.  They had one piece of that fantastic tiramisu left and I bought it.  There was some dramatic lightning against the skyline as we drove home, especially from Freedom Parkway where you have a magnificent view of the city.  We had just brought the groceries in when the rain poured down.  The wind was blowing hard. Naturally, I did the only thing I knew to do.  I ate tiramisu and went to bed.  I was tired.  I got up Sunday and went to church.  I found myself distracted because of all the things I still needed to do this weekend.  There was a teenage boy sitting four rows in front of me.  He was dressed in a suit and his haircut made him look like a grown man.  He was kind of sitting in a grown up way.  Even though I knew he was too big to be a little person, I kept watching him periodically through out the service because he just stuck out.  A cute married couple in orange sat down three rows in front of me.  They had the cutest little girl with big glasses with thick lenses.  She was too cute.  Two rows in front of me, the butch lesbian trio sat together.  I though there was a fourth, but it just turned out to be a heavy metal guy with long hair.  There was a hispanic guy sitting in front of me.  He came in late and I think he's gay.  His shoes were a dead give away.  Don't ask me to explain.  It's instinct.  He may be a few years older than me.  During the announcements, I contemplated his haircut.  I wish my hair looked like his in the back, but it's too thick.  I always wanted jet black hair.  Rev. John was in a bible-flipping mood and we we flipped through our pew bibles.  I finally stopped because by the time I find the section he's reading from, he's almost through reading it and I don't get anything out of it.  As I was getting into my car to leave, I noticed the hispanic guy and said hello.  He was startled at first and then smiled. I wonder if anyone has ever made the effort to introduce themselves to him before?  I'll try to do that next week.  I did more cleaning when I got home and then began cooking.  Jeff did some things outside and then worked on presentation.  After the Progressive Dinner Party, I ironed a shirt for him while he worked on his presentation to appeal our property taxes Monday morning.  I called and spoke with my mom and little sister and that was about it.  Where does the time go?

       POST PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY   It's the morning after and we had a great time.  I live on a really neat block with a diverse group of people.  Eleven out of fourteen houses participated and we also had some participants from outside the neighborhood.  A northern blew in last night, but I still attended in shorts and a smart, orange T-shirt with stripes.  I felt rather Charlie Brown-esque in my fashion.  The cool weather was refreshing.  We started at 6pm with drinks and appetizers at Jeff & Susan's house.  They are really fun.  I hadn't had the opportunity to spend much time with them before, but I have decided that I like them and that they can stay.  I made spinach and artichoke dip and some fruit dip with amareto.  Fortunately, the group didn't eat it all so I got to bring some home. I love the fruit dip.  It really gives a strawberry some kick.  "Oh, I'm drunk off the fruit dip!"  Not.  We went to Joey & Amy's house next for soup and salad. Come to think of it, I didn't get any soup.  I wonder if it was good.  The salads were great.  Marcia led a lively discussion on the joys of TiVo.  I waxed on graciously about a new spam blocker called  urlLink Spambayes , which Mike at  urlLink To Blog Or Not To Blog  wrote about.  It truly is a great spam blocker.  It learns as it goes and it's doing a great job.  The group then descended upon the Johnson home for the main entrees.  We had some great ribs and sides.  Come to think of it, I didn't have the opportunity to eat all the sides.   The Johnsons have a large family room with this wrap around couch that reminds me of being a guest on Good Morning America.  I interviewed Marcia about her imaginary novel,  Why I Hate George W. Bush .  I made a pitch for the Moth Ball and our neighborhood yard sale.  I also had the opportunity to learn more about Lorenia's college years and how she met her husband, Roland.  We finished at Tony and Thom's house.  Thom made a delicious mandarin orange cake, which someone said was moister than a drunk sororiety girl at a keg party.  I'm not sure about that, but it was moist and tasty. Dave made a coconut cake.  Our chocolate cherry cobbler wasn't a disaster, but I found it to be somewhat lackluster.  Jeff said it needed more cherry pie filling.  Probably so.  I don't know that I would make it again.  Jeff 3 was working the coffee bar and gave me a mean capacino.  There was some discussion about the effects of caffeine to which some people were surprised when I mentioned that caffeine has no effect on me.  I'm not sure if it was doubt or amazement in their eyes.  I chased Olive, Tony & Thom's dog, around the house for some exercise and then we ended the evening on the sleeping porch as Jeff & Susan told us the story of how they met in traffic court.  We discussed how to discern from all the Jeffs and Susans on our block.  It's easy for me because I'm 1F and Jeff is 2Fs.  Gigi dubbed Jeff as Jeff 3 a few years ago.  Jeff 3 suggested a J-lo concept, but that would make me J-Blo and that doesn't sound very good.  Jeff 3 stated that he got first dibs on J-Ho.

       100 REASONS TO BE GAY   My friend, Tim, sent this to me.  I found it somewhat amusing and thought I would share it with you.   In celebration of the mirth it caused we thought wed share it with you all. Arent we kind ? If youre on a random joke list then you might have seen it before, but the oldies are always the best (unless youre lucky enough to pull some young chicken) and we say share and share alike (unless its an STD).    So, here are 100 reasons to be gay. How many can you own up too ?  1. You truly don`t care who Julia Roberts is sleeping with. 2. You understand the difference between 43 brands of imported vodka. 3.

       OLD TEXAS DRIVER'S LICENSE   I was cleaning out the filing cabinet today to make room for my business files and I'm consolidating my personal documents into a pendaflex.  I've been able to throw out tons.  I found my old driver's license from when I was 21.  I look so different, but not so different.  First, I was very, very skinny.  I've always had the hardest time gaining weight.  My jaw seems more square.  I still have the same long, thick, floppy, blonde hair.  I have on a black Boy London T-shirt and a white cardigan.  I must have thought it was really cool as I was still heavily influenced by Bananarama at the time.  I can't say that I look more innocent because I know that I certainly wasn't.  In some ways, I had not been beaten down by life yet, and then in other ways, now I have learned to control my thinking and see the joy in every moment.  I can't say that I would want to go back to that time in my life again unless I knew what I know now.  I'm not someone who has ever been cordial to regret. I view it as a waste of energy and time.  I've often thought of writing my autobiography now that I have had some time to distance myself between the more painful times of my youth.  Now I understand myself better and why I did the things I did.  I also understand the people who were in my life at the time better too.  I wonder if there is some reason why I came across this photograph at this moment in my life.  I shall have to sleep on it, me thinks.

       SWIM STRAIGHT, SOLDIER!   This morning I got up at seven and drove over to Kiki's house to renew our swimming program from last year.  We've had conflicts for most of June, but we are finally back onto a Tuesday and Thursday schedule.    I'm not a natural swimmer.  It took me a very long time to become comfortable in the water as a child.  Because my mother never learned to swim well, she insisted that my sister and I take swim lessons.  Our first attempt was at the local community college.  We had to rinse off in the showers before getting in the pool, which were also shared by the students. They were open showers and I can remember the shock of rinsing off and turning to my right to see a penis and furry scrotum staring at me.  I think I may have let out a yelp.  I don't recall every paying much attention when I may have seen my father undressed before then. Moreover, I had been so close to anyone's private area before.  It wasn't sexual at all.  It was more the shock of seeing something there that I wasn't expecting and almost putting my eye out.  I must have been about seven so my eye level was right at there crotch level.  I felt that the younger people should have had a separate shower area from the college students because we were just there to rinse off.  We weren't  serious showerers .  Swim lessons at the community college got off to a rocky start.  The instructor, a college-age girl, was rather impatient.  I remember she was working with me to help me float on my back and I just started babbling about how I really didn't want to take swimming lessons, but my mother had made me and I was just sure I was going to drown.  Although there was no couch, it was definitely water therapy.  The next summer, we took swim lessons at the YWCA with a woman my mother knew from Girl Scouts.  The classes were much smaller and I found that I actually learned to become comfortable in the water.  I could float and tread water, but I never could get the breathing right for freestyle.  In January of 2003 I ordered two videos from  urlLink Total Immersion Swimming , which was created by Terry Laughlin.  He basically paid attention to what made some swimmers move faster in the water with less effort and created a fishllike swimming program.  It's based upon the principles of achieving balance in the water, which is not exactly the way we have been taught to swim in the past.  Through progressive drills, students learn to find their balance in the water and lengthen their body to make it more streamlined in the water.  This results in being able to move more swiftly in the water while use less effort.  These principles have worked for many U.S. Olympic swimmers.  Having wanted to learn the four Masters swim strokes for some time, I decided to give the program a try.  After all, swimming is a great low impact and highly aerobic form of exercise.  Last summer we worked on the butterfly and breaststroke and this year we are working on freestyle and the backstroke.  I've already been amazed at how these drills that start off so far from the final stroke work so well.  My biggest challenge seems to be with my feet, which seem to sink like I'm wearing a pair of concrete Keds.  However, fins seem to help.  I also seem to have a problem going in a straight line on my back.  I think that I'm either throwing myself off with my kicking or my head is not exactly straight.  When you're looking up at the sky, it's hard to keep your bearings.  I'm really commited to this.  Anyone who knows me knows that I hate to be cold.  I need a reason to put on a Speedo and jump in the cold water early in the morning.  I also have to say that a swim cap is like a condom for the head.  It's tight and unattractive.  It makes me look like a blue bullet.  The one odd thing I have noticed over time is that I don't like being in the pool by myself. It's not that I fear a shark is suddenly going to appear in the pool to attack me, but I have a lot of anxiety about being alone in the water with no one around.  I'm not particurlary scared about getting into trouble as I'm rather relaxed in the water, but perhaps on some level I'm afraid that an accident could occur that might leave me unconscious and I'll drown.  I decided this morning that I just needed to push my comfort zone and work through this anxiety once and for all.  As I practiced my backstroke drill down the pool, I affirmed how comfortable I was in the water by myself. I am safe.  No harm can come to me.  Then I ran into the other end of the pool head first. Perhaps there is a reazon I should be anxious.

       HAN SOLO AND PRINCESS LEIA   When I was twelve years old I developed a strange obsession with Luke Skywalker's relationship with Princess Leia Organa.  The kiss for luck before they swung across the bottomless chasm in the Deathstar connected with a deeply hidden, gooey, emotional center that I can only equate with the Barbie gene in young girls.  I was constantly speculating on how Luke and Leia's relationship was developing.  How often did they see each other?  Did Luke always pay for dinner and was it fair since he was just moisture farmer and she was a princess?  Did Luke kiss Leia in a way that made her hair buns unfurl?  My Kenner action figures were practically Malibu Barbie and Ken. They would go on dates in Luke's landspeeder that were probably just like Barbie and Ken's mating rituals except that they were interupted by Tuskin Raiders.  I knew Luke was just about to pop the question when the novel for  The Empire Strikes Back  was released.  The picture of Luke looking deeply into Leia's eyes touched a passionate part of me that almost caused me to swoon.  Oddly enough, I did not think this strange for a 12-year-old boy.  I immediately read the book in one night and was shocked to find out that scoundrel Han Solo basically stabbed his best friend in the back and stole his girl.  And don't get me started on that two timing bitch, that's Ms. Organa to you, who could not have a decent hair do if she tried.  I was so devastated that I put my Han Solo action figure in a shoe box and put him on the uppermost shelf of my closet.  It was the only way I felt I could control the situation.  I felt so lied to.  I felt like George Lucas had misled me.  I felt that Alan Dean Foster had gotten my hopes up in Splinter Of The Mind's Eye only have my hopes and dreams stomped upon by a one-legged Vegas showgirl in stileto.  What about the house?  What about the children?  I had already picked out the names Logan and Ariel.  What did I have left to live for?  I had spent two years pouring all of my energy into a relationship that had suddenly come to an end.  All I had done was give, give, give and look what I got in return.  NOTHING.    In time, I slowly began to heal.  I found Luke and Leia began to avoid one another and if one showed up on the Milenium Falcon, the other would disappear into my Creature Cantina playset.  Wondering what Leia saw in Han that she no longer saw in him, Luke began to look at the walrus man in a strange new way.  He would find himself getting drunk and venturing out into dark alleys with willing Jawas.  It just wasn't right.  When Luke and Leia did find themselves in social situations, it was awkward and the conversation forced.  Eventually, I returned Han to the fold and he and Leia didn't waste anytime before moving in together.  Luke couldn't stand to watch it and aliented himself on my dresser where he threw himeelf into his Jedi training.  Before long, all was forgotten.  Looking back, I think this was my first experience with disappointment in a relationship, even though I was only indirectly involved.  In the future, I would find myself looking at boyfriends like a Leia who had abandoned me for a Han.  Inevetiably, I would find myself in a bar moisturizing my sorrow in a frosty swirl.  I looked to my left and saw a walrus man of a different kind, but thankfully, I saw no Jawas.

       MOTHBALL DIARY   We had another meeting tonight at Katy's house.  Katy put together a list of possible sponsors and we each have contacts to ask to contribute.  We discussed the band and DJ situation.  We have three months left and we are beginning to feel the pressure so naturally we wandered off to discuss the connection between men and porn.  "It seems to me that gay men would be more apt to have porn because they are so much more promiscuous than straight men," said KM.  "I disagree," KS argued.  "I bet there's porn in your house that you don't know about."  "But when I worked at the hair salon, all the gay guys talked about how they watched porn and their sexual adventures."  "Gay men are more likely to open up and share with you about those things because they view you as a friend, confidant and equal.  Straight men would never share that with you unless you were a lesbian," I offered.  "What do you mean?"  "Straight men view women as either a potential sexual experience, their mother or someone who will tell whatever they say to their wife or girlfriend, which will make their life a living hell."  "That's a good point."  "Men are biologically created to want to mate and think about sex constantly," KS explained.  "They also have permision to be more open and honest about it because even if they are dating someone or in a relationship, it is somehow more acceptable."  "I would agree with that for the most part," I said. "Gay men tend to have make open relationships part of their lifestyle more commonly than their straight counterparts."  "I don't think women are able to do that as easily.  I mean, open relationships are a great idea in theory, but I would just be too jealous."  "It's not for me," I advised. "However, I can see why three-way live-in relationships would be attractive. 'Oh, you're going down to the dungeon to take turns fisting one another? Y'all have fun.  No, I think I'll just spend a quiet evening on the couch with Edith Wharton.' I would love having a night off."  We laughed and I felt my bond with my straight sisters bringing us closer together.  We realized we got off track and got back to business for a few minutes.  "Have you read the new David Sedaris book?"  "I just got it in the mail today.  I'm so excited.  Is it good?"  "It's the best one yet.  Although, his fascination with feces disturbs me."  "Not me.  I'm a mother and pet owner.  I live with shit every day."  Here we go again.

       CAN I SEE A PORK ROAST AND NOT THINK OF A FEMALE SERIAL KILLER?   Once a month some of my neighbors and I will get together for a potluck dinner a movie that we like to refer to as  Cinematherapy .  We usually start at 6:00pm and rap up around 10:30pm or so.    The weekend had already been rather busy.  I hadn't felt well on Thursday or Friday and Saturday was pretty much the same.  I spent a lot of time sleeping and reading.  Occasionally I would get up a do a few things and then head back to bed.  I don't know if it was a bug or just something from the constant on again/off again rain we have been having.  For the past two weeks the sky will go completely dark as if the world is ending and it will rain and then it will be sunny as a picture post card day and then the sky will become black again.  This has been occuring daily for what seems like forever.  I felt better on Sunday and tried to make up for lost time.  I headed over to Marcia's house and we had a delicious dinner.  Marcia made a pork roast with pepper jelly.  It doesn't sound good, but it tasted great.  Gigi made a great salad with mandarin oranges.  Dave brought some bread from Atlanta Bread Company.  It was big slices of manly bread.  Jeff W. made a vegetable dish with potatoes, brocoli, sweet poatatoes and pears.  It was absolutely delicious.  I made a strawberry Jello pie with a graham cracker crust.  It was all good.  For movie selections, Marcia let us decide between  Stargate  and  Aileen: Life And Death Of A Serial Killer .  We chose the documentary, which is about Aileen Wuornos who Charlize Theron played in the movie  Monster .  I must admit that I haven't had much of an interest to see Monster although I've heard the performances are great.  I saw  Boys Don't Cry  a few years ago and it just bummed me out for the rest of the afternoon.  My friends Merredith and Bran told me they watched  Monster  a few weeks ago and they were left feeling like society had really failed this woman.  "She never had a chance," Merredith stated.  I tend to shy away from making such definite statements.  This lady killed seven men in cold blood.  I mentioned reading that there was a documentary released shortly before  Monster  was released and I would be interested in seeing that.  As fate had it, I did.  The documentary was very well done.  It picks up with the film-maker being summoned to be a witness in Aileen's appeal trial and when he gets there, Aileen suddenly denies that the witnesses testifying on her behalf are not telling the truth.  She seems to be sabotaging her defense.  As it turns out, Aileen realizes that she is never going to get off death row and she just wants to get the wait over and be executed  "The waiting is driving me crazy."  She believes that the police knew she was the killer after the first murder, but wanted her to continue cleaning up the world so they would have someone to pin it on.  It is uncovered that three police officers and Aileen's lover tried to sell a film deal regarding her story and could have resulted in a retrial or something to that nature.  Nothing happened.  Her childhood is explored.  Aileen's mother abandoned her when she was six-months old and she was brought up by her grandfather who physically and sexually abused her.  Her brother had sex with her.  All the boys in the neighborhood had sex with her, but didn't want to associate with her in public.  She gave birth to a baby at thirteen and gave it up for adoption.  She was thrown out of her house and lived in the woods for two years.  She was an outcast that society ignored.  Eventually, she went to Florida and became a prostitute.  I found myself agreeing that society had indeed failed this woman. She never stood a chance.  Yes, she killed seven men, but if anything in her life had been different, would it have made a difference?

       KYLIE MINOGUE MAILING LIST   I realized today that even though I'm sure Abby is a fine girl, I do not need to receive 50 e-mails from her each day regarding Australian, pop singer, Kylie Minogue.  Abby, who I believe lives in Oklahoma, loves Kylie.  I know this because she mentions it in her many e-mails each day.  She also loves Kylie fans and carefully places little "X's" and "O's" in her e-mails to signify the love and kisses that she is spreading to us all.  I'm not sure how I suddenly got on the Kylie Minogue Mailing List, but I began receiving e-mails about two months ago.  I would like to know updates on when new material is being released, but I do not want to do speculate on whether or not Kylie has had a brow lift, if she and her boyfriend, Oliver Martinez, have secretly wed, wax on about the merits of Kylie painting her front door pink, debate whether or not you can actually see her left nipple in a photo from 1988 or what Kylie song is best to make love too.  For consistent rhythm and motion during the dirty deed,  The Loco-Motion  is going to win hands down every time. It's time to let go.  Now I must find where the details are to unsubscribe myself from the list.  Sorry, Kylie, but I must be free.

       GAY PRIDE AND BISHOP DON   Vickie is moving to West Virginia and her going away party was canceled.  Jeff was notified that he had to go out of town for business this weekend and he's going away on a missionary trip the following weekend.  Meanwhile, our friends Mark and Steve invited us to walk around the corner and meet some friends of theirs who recently moved to the neighborhood.  Afterwards, I planned to meet Joan and Joanne at Vinyl to watch Joanne's son's band, Bishop Don, play.  I did laundry for Jeff before he came home and made dinner while he was running last minute errands.  He asked why I had not taken the remaining items from our yard sale to Goodwill.  I told him it had been raining.  He said he could not stand to have the stuff on the porch a minute longer and he was going to take everything to Goodwill right this second.  I told him to knock himself out... and so he did.  I made dinner and was beginning to wonder where he was when it occured to me that Goodwill has books and that explained why he was so anxious to go to Goodwill.  I smiled and kept the food warm until he got home.  We ate and then Mark and Steve showed up.    We walked down to Steve and Tim's house for their gay pride party.  It's very nicely decorated.  It looks like the Fab Five exploded inside.  I jokingly asked Steve if they had a dungeon and he replied with all sincerity that it was in the basement, but the door was locked.  I asked Mark for a hairpin so I could open the lock and have a peek, but then someone offered me a Jello shot and I was gone.  It was difficult prying the Jello shot out of the plastic cup. I noticed that the lesbians at the party seemed to be ferreting out the Jello from the cup with their skilled tongues.  I suddenly had even more respect for my lesbian sisters.  It was amazing to see how many gay men live in Atlanta.  I recognized people from when I used to go to Bally's several years ago.  I talked with a couple as I was standing outside.  One minute Andy was telling me how he moved from Ohio and the next minute he is telling me that if he gets down on all fours and places his butt high enough in the air, this allows Joe to insert his penis into Andy's rectum and repeated pound his prostrate, which results in a satisfying and messy orgasm for both.  I tilted my head to the side and said, "Hmmm." I then excused myself to get one of those delicious little homemade piggies in the blankets that were inside.  I wasn't sure if this conversation occured because of my natural ability to put people at ease and tell me all of their personal business or whether I just attract freaks.  Mark and I briefly discussed updating the Grant Park Tour of Homes and Gardens to include sex chambers and dungeons.  Last year we had candle making demonstrations, lessons on whipping up dried flower arrangements and a tutorial on how to churn your own butter.  Wouldn't it be interesting this year to provide helpful hints on what household cleaners best removed bodily fluids from latex clothing, show the versatility of the velcro dungeon and providing a hands on fisting demonstration.  "Are there any volunteers who would like to get into the sling?"  After half an hour, Jeff and I headed back home.  He continued to pack and I drove into town to see Bishop Don play.  Joanne had on a Bishop Don T-shirt and she has to be the cutest band mother I've ever met.  She was be-bopping in the crowd with her little backpack on.  I also enjoyed watching young heterosexual men dance to the music.  It's a little less fluid than homosexual dance steps.  It's much more stacato with jerky movements... like having an epileptic fit without falling down.  Joan and I watched two girls play video games at the bar all night.  The band was good. They played a variety of styles and wore little suits that reminded me of punk bands from the late seventies.  I started to fall asleep after 1:00am, but the show ended and I headed home.    I was quite hungry at this point so I decided to stop at Taco Bell on the way home and buy a quesadilla.  It made me feel just like Ryanstask.  I placed my order at the little drive-thru box.  The attendant said something back, but I couldn't understand him.  Finally I heard him say just to pull around.  As it turns out, he didn't get my order at all and I had to wait for them to make the quesadilla at the window.  The attendant became very flustered.  It looked like he was understaffed.  I thanked him for my quesadilla and headed home.    Jeff was still up when I arrived home.  He finished packing right after I brushed my teeth and we went to bed.  Sleep never felt so good.

       WISH ME WELL   I haven't felt very good the past three days.  It seems like every morning I wake up with a headache and I feel nauseated and I'm tired.  By the late afternoon, I usually feel better.  However, it has put a screeching halt to my productivity both in business and my personal life.    I spoke with a friend on the telephone and mentioned that I didn't feel very well.  As soon as I uttered the words, I thought to myself, "Now she's going to tell me that I've been burning the candle at both ends."  My friend asked, "Is your body just stressed out from doing too darn much?" I laughed to myself. I was amused by my ability to predict what someone will say after knowing them for many years.  I'm sure you can all think of examples in your own lives from your own friends.    After I hung up with my friend, I recalled a conversation I had with her a month or so ago where she told me that she wished sometimes I would just listen to her vent and not offer suggestions for taking action.  I understood what she was saying.  It's a very male-oriented trait and at home with my practical nature. I suddenly realized that I wished that if I mentioned that I was tired or not feeling well, I wished my friend would not immediately comment on my condition as being the result of doing too much or not taking care of myself.  I just want to say I'm sick or tired in a venting way and for my friend to say, "That's too bad.  Well, I hope you get to feeling better."    Then it occured to me that my friend is just expressing her authentic self by reminding to take care of myself.  She enjoys mothering people.  It's how she expresses her love for others.  However, my authentic self does not want to be mothered.  I have a mother already.  As I look back over our friendship, I can see a definite pattern of how when she mothers me, I pull back.  I find this very interesting because in all the years this little dance has been going on, I've never consciously thought about it or analyzed it.  It just seemed so silly, but then I realized something interesting was going on.  My friend is making some changes in her life that have suddenly made her aware of certain feelings and beliefs she has about certain things and she is consciously making new choices to bring about positive change in her life.  Like a pebble in a pond, I realized that her ripple effect is spreading out and making me aware of some of my own unrecognized feelings and beliefs.  In the end, the fact that my friend mothers me has never been a serious issue, but I'm excited by the effect her own fearlessness to change her own life is beginning to rub off on me.

       PRJOECT ARCHITOOTHIS   Ben has a new music project and is looking for writers to submit lyrics for him to put to music.  If you would like to hear some of his work, click  urlLink here .  I finally made time to jot something down.  I don't do much with rhyme, but felt like doing so tonight.  It always looks funny to me.  This is my dark song about obsessive love with a twist of Bjork.  I hope you like it.   Paper In Your Hands  Sitting in the long grass Watching your house My heart is my compass Thoughts of you arouse  The wind carries your scent To my troubled heart What is it your words meant? I'm left in the dark  Your silhouette is a painful reminder  Of the spell you have cast over me The light spilling from your window Is far too weak to shine the truth On my fantasies  I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Fold me over and keep me secret But close to your heart  Looking in your bedroom You talk on the phone Talking now with someone Now taken my throne  Your deep laughter pierces through me With the force of a subway train Blinded by what I want to see And now my school boy dreams are slain It's a tragedy  I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Fold me over and keep me secret But close to your heart  I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Let me keep your thoughts and poetry Whisper to your heart  Don't wad me up Or throw me away Nor cut me up In little pieces  Don't cover me With another sheet Take me out and Use me, use me, use me  Staring down at your face The time has now come Ink dripping from my pen There's no place to run  Your eyes show surprise at my grip My hand over your soft mouth Write on my skin with fountain tip Let me feel the prick of your vow It's such majesty  I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Fold me over and keep me secret But close to your heart  I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Let me keep your thoughts and poetry Whisper to your heart  I'm afraid of the empty page I'm afraid of the empty page I'm afraid of the empty page I'm afraid of the empty page

       PAINKILLERS   I could not get to sleep last night and I finally fell asleep about three.  I got up early to attend our neighborhood business meeting.  Cathy Woolard discussed the new beltline develop, which will provide intown rail service for neighborhood residents on existing railways in the city.  Cathy also resigned as President of the Atlanta City Council three months ago and will now run for the fourth Congressional seat.  It was a good business meeting.  I met a real estate investor and the business manager for a builder.  Things are looking up.  Afterwards, I drove around Cabbagetown and Reynoldstown looking for realtors and For Sale By Owner (FSBO) properties to contact.    I came home to Jef Base Alpha to check e-mail.  It seems my neighbor, Tony, was held up at gun point by four men outside his home last night.  I don't have many details, but I assume that Tony came home late last night since he is a doctor and works varied shifts.  He said they held a gun to his head.  This is very unsettling since most neighbors on our street would agree that we live on one of the most well lit and safest streets in the neighborhood.  Obviously we need to keep our eyes open... especially on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings when most crack addicts come down from their high and need to steal to buy their next fix.  The best thing to do is throw your wallet toward the robber and run for the house.  They usually just want the money and are typically bad shots anyway so their chances of fatally wounding you are low.  The worst thing you can do is cooperate by laying down face down.  You never know when these people are so tweaked that they might shoot you anyway.  I came home this evening and took a  nap.  I haven't felt very good the past few days.  Jeff brought me back some dinner after his dinner meeting.  I felt like I was walking underwater for quite some time.  In a rare occurence, I turned the television on.  It's rather pathetic that I actually had to look at the manual to figure out how to work the remote.  After some effort, I was able to find  Will & Grace .  Sadly, it wasn't funny and I found a documentary on the  History Chanel  about King Arthur.  I found it interesting that Camelot and Lancelot actually came from the French and were later incorporated into the Excalibur legend.  Now I am watching VH1 Classic.  I love this station.  I've seen Word Up by Cameo.  The lead singer has been thrown into jail so many times here in Georgia for not paying child support.  Then I watched Kim Wilde sing Kids In America.  She looked so young and skinny.  She looks nothing like the 40ish, heavier Kim Wilde who appears on Garden Invaders in the UK now.  From pop music to horticulture, she has certainly changed.  I saw the video for She Blinded Me With Science by Thomas Dolby.  I had actually forgotten that video.  I remember playing Donkey Kong on my Colecovision while listening to that song on the radio.    Dolby reminds me of a guy named Randy that I dated in my first year in Atlanta.  He was shorter and a vegetarian.  I laughed when he told me his house burned down on New Year's Eve.  I thought he was joking, but then he showed me the video tape with the story that was on the news.  He lived in the Georgian Terrace Hotel across from the Fox Theater, which is where Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable stayed when they were in town for the premiere of Gone With The Wind.  However, the movie did not premire at the Fox Theater.  Randy wasn't actually my type.  A friend had suggested that I place a personal ad in Southern Voice and I did.  I don't remember much about the few other guys that answered except that they each seemed to have some fatal, psychological flaw.  Randy and I talked on the phone several weeks before we met.  He made me laugh at a time when I needed to.  In December I had just moved into a one bedroom apartment in Morrow, Georgia.  I had very little money and little furniture.  I slept on a air mattress.    I would go over to Jeff's house on Tuesday and Thursday evenings to work out, but I rarely saw him any other time with his various commitments.  I was lonely and I enjoyed talking to Randy on the telephone as I laid on the air mattress in the dark with the Art Of Noise playing in the background.  When I finally met him, we had brunch in Virginia Highlands and walked through Piedmont Park.  It was Janauary, but not cold.  We sat on the hill and held hands and it was nice even if he wasn't someone who I would normally be attracted to.  We often saw each other on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  He was a consultant for Anderson and traveled throughout the week.  He took me to a lot of different restaurants and would rarely let me pay.  I didn't think much about this at first, but after a while, it began to bother me.  No matter how many times I brought it up, he just dismissed it.  Randy liked Morrisey, Thomas Dolby, Bronski Beat and the Pet Shop Boys.   Bilingual  was their newest album and we listened to it a lot.  I just sort of opened myself up to him over time and eventually my feelings deepened.  I remember one night we were lying in bed in mid tryst and I said, "I love you."  It just sort of slipped out without any thought and it surprised me.  Randy froze and his back muscles tensed up.  I asked what was wrong. "Nothing," he said and I can say with absolute certainty that's when everything changed.  Over the next few weeks, we saw each other less and our telephone conversations grew shorter.  One night, we went to dinner and he was just painfully silent.  I remember feeling very strong and thinking if this was the end, just say so and get it over with.  He wanted me to come back to his apartment and he watched television while I read.  Eventually we went to bed and he just laid there.  I asked him where we stood and what he wanted.  He said he didn't know how he felt and I was confused.  In hindsight, I wished I had just gone home.  However, over time, I found my strength whittling away.  I became a slave to uncertainty and found my emotions unraveling.  The relationship was ending, but I didn't know why.  I just wanted closure, but that was being withheld from me.  I couldn't understand it and one night I remember crying about it.  Correction - it was beyond crying; it was deep sobbing where my whole body shook and I didn't think I'd ever be able to stop.  It scared me because I'm not an overly emotional person, yet I knew that what was coming up wasn't just about Randy.  It was like I was grieving all of these old fears and unresolved feelings from my entire life.  Twenty-nine years of stuff was just bubbling up and I was boiling over.  I found myself listening to the Pet Shop Boys album over and over, but the songs seemed so different now.  The joy had been replaced by sadness.  I actually helped him move to another apartment in the midst of the undoing of the us that no longer was.  I remember sitting on his bed asking how we could work things out and him telling me that we could never work things out.  He didn't have the same feelings for me that I had for him.  Some may call it denial, but I knew that he felt more for me than he let on.  His mouth said one thing, but his body language belied his words.  I left his apartment and walked back to my car.  I was surrounded by hundreds of people on the sidwalks of downtown Atlanta, but I couldn't have felt more alone.  Randy and I went to in-line skate in Piedmont Park.  It was very important to him for some reason to maintain a connection with me.  At one point, I remember asking him if the reason he was pushing me away was because of his unresolved feelings about his mother's death from cancer.  He became very angry so I knew I was right.  We sat on the patio of The Mill, our skates still on, and he pretended that nothing was wrong.  Intuition told me that there was someone else now.  I just wanted him to admit it.  I just wanted him to tell me the truth so I could let go.  I pulled back for a while and limited my contact with him.  I told Jeff about what had happened and his reaction surprised me.  He seemed uncomfortable to find out that I had been dating someone for three months.  Why should he care?  We began to spend more time together and I noticed that when we were together, we began to talk more openly and shared more intimate details about ourselves.  There was an energy between us that was building, but I didn't think much more about it.  I was too tired of conjecturing about what had happened between Randy and I without having any information.  Randy and I went to dinner one evening.  We each had some stuff that belonged to the other.  It was another attempt to maintain a friendship.  Ironically, we had dinner in the same restaurant where we had brunch on that first date.  I felt much stronger now.  I had accepted that what my intuition told me was true and I no longer needed for him to tell me.  I made my own closure.  Randy sensed the difference in me.  I think he liked the idea of knowing that perhaps I would always be there.  I became aware of the fact that Randy's humor now seemed caustic and mean-spirited, where as before I always found him very clever and witty.  I wondered if he had always been like that or whether he had changed.  He reached for the check when it came and I took it.  He told me he'd get it and I said, "No, it's important to me," and I paid the damn thing.  My stuff was in the trunk of his car.  He had bought a Saab Convertible and I couldn't help but think it was just a change of scenery.  We talked for a moment and I said I had to go.  This seemed to startle him.  I hugged him and left.  On my way home, I stopped by Jeff's house and we talked a bit.  I asked him if I could spend the night on his couch.  "I'm fine, but I just don't want to go home to my apartment.  I've spent too much time looking at the same old walls feeling sad and I feel too good to feel that sadness out of habit."  He understood and we were lying in the floor talking and I felt us growing closer.  I wasn't expecting this, but I kissed him and he kissed me back and the plot thickened.  Randy and I went to lunch a few weeks later and hiking on Kennesaw Mountain.  It unsettled me that I didn't find him funny at all now.  In fact, he irritated me because everything he said seemed to put someone down.  We were near the top of the mountain and he finally admitted that he had been seeing someone else near the end.  I suspect that he answered another personal ad after I said the "L Word."  He asked me if I was seeing someone else and I told him I was.  "It's funny, but I think our relationship was just something to pass time before Jeff and I became involved."  He looked as if I had socked him in the stomach.  "It never would have lasted between us because as soon as something happened between Jeff and I, I would have ended things with you."  I didn't say it to be mean or hurt him.  It was true.  The past few months had given me a lot of time to think and my relationship with Randy had been a painkiller.  It was a relationship that distracted him and allowed him to no deal with what was inside himself.  It was a relationship built on sand that never would have lasted the first rain.  Randy sent me a few e-mails over the next few months, just jokes and stuff that he forwarded to me and then we finally just let each other go.  Two years later, I went to a Pet Shop Boys concert at the Tabernacle.  At the end of the show, I saw Randy there with a girl friend of his that I had never meant before.  He was drunk and he was purposely laughing loudly and stumbling aroudn to get my attention.  I looked into his eyes and I can't exactly explain what they said to me.  I think he understood now what had really happened between us.  I think he missed me.  I think if he could have done things differently, he would have.  I think he appreciated me.  I smiled at him and walked by.  I wasn't trying to be mean, but my gut told me there was nothing left for me to learn from him.  He was looking at me with bedroom eyes that only people who have slept with each before can recognize.  I was in a relationship now and it wouldn't only be a reanactment of the past.  It was just another painkiller and I had no place being there.    I hope he's doing well now.  I really do wish him happiness and good health.  Looking back, the one thing that stands out about Randy after all this time is that flossing was very important to him.

       SUNFLOWERS   The other afternoon, Jeff and I were outside in the backyard and he told me to close my eyes.  He led me over near the fence and told me to open my eyes.  He had planted some sunflowers for me and they had bloomed. They were huge.  I'm always so amazed at how tall they grow from little bitty seeds.  I had been asking to plant some for the longest time, but he told me we didn't have any space for them.  Then he plants them anyway.  He's a sneaky guy.    Sunflowers remind me of one of my favorite summers.  It was 1980 and we lived in Waco.  I was going into the seventh grade in the fall and I was breaking new ground in so many ways.  As a 12-year old boy, my bike was my passport to adventure and I had begun expanding my territory out beyond Bellaire Drive to include Topeka and finally the new subdivision they were building four streets over.  I never asked for my permission to ride beyond the boundaries my parents had set for me years early; I just did it.  My best friend, Kurt, and I would ride our bikes up to 7-11 and I would sometimes buy a treat that consisted of two cookies with vanilla ice cream in the middle. It had a particular name like a cookiewich, but I don't think that was it.  That was 24 years ago.  Yikes!  Where has the time gone?  Anyway, we would ride back home and we would take a short cut that led through the new subdivision.  The road snaked around the edge of the development and on the left side of the road there was a field with oceans of sunflowers that went off into the distance.  I would hear choruses of cicadas singing their otherworldly songs, which sounded like something from a science fiction movie from the fifties.  I should know.  I didn't live in that time period.  I remember that I often wanted to stop and wander into the sunflowers, exploring what was in the middle of the field.  However, if we left our bikes on the side of the road, they would have been stolen.  Plus, I could hear my mother's voice in my head warning of snakes.  Still, the appeal of wandering into the sunflowers that towered over me appealed to some primal part of me.  Perhaps it was the onset of puberty that pounded primordial, tribal rhyhms in my head as it pumped testosterone throughout my body.  It wasn't sexual, per se, but it was very powerful.  I longed to be part of a secret brotherhood that did not exist.  So many unknown things were being revealed to me and I wanted to know the answers to all of life's mysteries.  I can't explain it, but even now, I can still feel it.

       SEX IN THE SODA SECTION   After the aborted attempt to swim, I decided to drive up to Publix and pick up a turkey wrap for dinner.  2F's was out for the evening having beer and wings with a closeted friend.  2F's friend likes to go out once a week to some of the more subdued gay bars, but told Jeff tonight that he could no longer use him as an alibi because his wife is beginning to suspect that Jeff is gay.  I like to think of Jeff's friend as my own personal reality TV show.  It's too strange to be real, but it is.  I walked by the dessert case with the tiramisu.  I didn't plan to buy any, but I still like to know how many are there in case of an emergency.  I chose a vegetarian wrap and walked toward the check out lanes.    As I approached an endcap of soft drinks, I noticed a hunky guy in a tank top looking at me.  Without even thinking, I looked down at my feet and smiled.  I may have actually blushed as well.  After I walked by the guy, I remembered that I needed almonds and turned around to go down the aisle I had passed, which was just beyond the soft drinks.  As I did, I noticed the blonde guy smiling at me just as a case of soft drinks fell on him.  I laughed to myself as I went up the aisle for the can of almonds.  Unfortunately, they were out of the natural almonds and I once again headed for the check out lanes.    Feeling playful now, I got in line behind the hunky guy, which just happened to be the shortest line as well.  He knew I was behind him and he kept doing things to turn around like reaching for magazines and checking the nutrional information on candy bars and gum.  He had very nice upper arms and a nice butt.  Finally, I decided to move to the next lane, which had become shorter.  I picked up a copy of Vanity Fair with Becks on the cover and as I looked up, I saw him watching me.  Now I began to worry that I may have gotten myself in trouble.  Fortunately, his transaction was completed before mine and he walked out of the store, but not without giving me one more gaze.  As I walked out, it occured to me that it was nice to be noticed after being in a relationship for seven years.  It had been so innocent the way I looked up and saw him looking at me.  I was surprised that I could become so embarrassed like a school boy.  It wasn't aggressive or sexual.  It was like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock.  This guy liked the way I looked and just wanted to talk to me, perhaps ask me my name and if I might like to go get some coffee sometime.  I looked up at the sky after walking through the automatic doors.  The hunky guy was driving out of the parking lot in his SUV.  It sort of made me sad.  I wondered if he would have been a nice guy.  Would he have wanted to be my friend when I told him I was already in a relationship?  What would I do with him?  It was like throwing a fish back that was too small or endangered.  None the less, I caught myself smiling in the rearview mirror as I saw him smiling at me once again, just before the case of softdrinks fall on him.  Priceless!

       TASTEFUL NUDES   "Oh god!" Kiki began.  "There's Rudder Man.  He'll probably want a blow job in the locker room after our swim.  I suppose you'll want to watch."  "Not really," I replied.  "Remind me again of the name of this strange little world you live in."  Kiki turned his so quickly to the left to serve attitude that I thought I her his neck snap.  He regarded me in the large Jacki-O sunglasses and white robe, his hair swooped up in a towel-made turban.  He looked like  The Bride of Frankenstein  having a day of beauty a local salon.  Kiki and I had planned to work some laps in tonight, but Rudder Man advised us that the pool was closed for 24-hours due to contamination.  It seems some kid decided to use the pool as his or her own personal toilet.  I suppose it was for the best because lightening began a dramatic display in the distant sky as we left the pool.  I was picking my keys up off the sofa when Kiki shoved a  Playgirl  in my face and it was a bit unsettling having a head-on with a hard-on.    "How old would you say this man is?" Kiki asked.  "Fifty-five." I replied.  "Fity-five.  Can you believe it?"  "Yes, I read about him in  The Advocate ."  "It was in  The Advocate ."  "I'd like to have perky nipples like that," I explained.  "You know, the kind that just sort of hang off bulging pecs like stalagmatites."  "Well all you need to do is have a 300-pound man grab hold of them and jump of a tall building.  That's what stretches them out like that."  "Oh.  I guess you're right," I admitted, after closer inspection.  "Those would definitely draw attention throught a T-shirt."  As I flipped through the  Playgirl , I couldn't help notice how raunchy it has become.  Almost every guy is sporting a woody.  The last time someone had shoved a copy in my face it had been much more tame in comparison.  Kiki's new hobby is taking digital pictures of his friend, Eric, who is a model.  Kiki has decided that he can take some tasteful nude pictures of Eric, polarize them in PhotoShop and sell them at Randy's salon, Helmet.  As crazy as it sounds, he'll probably make enough to keep him in the sushi lifestyle he has grown accustomed to.  Kiki tells me that Eris is very protective of his penis and his ability to keep it concealed at all times while posing for nude photos in shower stalls almost qualifies him for membership in the  Justice Leage of America .    Kiki showed me another image that David dubbed boring. I suggested that he crop it more closely to create more tension and then copy it and flip the image so that mirrored the other side and then polarize the second image.  Kiki took my lead and began to inspect his work more with great interest as he stroked his imaginary Van Dyke.  "Tasteful nudes...." He muttered to himself as he stared at the monitor.  I couldn't help but laugh at how the line between tasteful and tasty is very fine indeed and dependent upon how recently the beholder has had an orgasm.

       POST PITCH UPDATE   I parked next to the Georgia World Congress Center and slipped into the Omni Hotel, which is attached to Phillips Arena and CNN Center. The buildings are all interconnected and it's more incestuous than an Alabama lineage.  I made my way up three escalators and as I walked across the skyway to CNN center, it became very quiet like I had slipped under water.  I looked out the glass walls and saw cars driving by silently.  It made me feel uncomfortable for some reason.  I signed in, drew my number, which was six and gave my screenplay to Jennifer in the Hospitatlity Room.  I stood around and talkd to a few of the other contestants for a few minutes.  They seemed dedicated and humble.  I was having trouble rehearsing my pitch after the stress from the morning's yard sale and fearing that I would forget to buy tickets for all of my friends who were coming to support me.  In the end, I did forget two.  Fortunately, they were able to buy tickets.  I decided to go ahead and read my pitch off a piece of paper.  I preferred to go up there without anything, but figured it was better than going blank since I was having trouble concentrating.  Mark Wynns came in and gave us our pep talk.  My friend, Greg, from the Georgia Film & Music Office came in.  I was afraid to say anything to him for fear that it would be read as a conflict of interest, but I didn't want him to think that I was ignoring him.  He winked at me when no one was looking and I felt okay.  Soon, we walked in and took our places in the front row. I was beginning to get nervous because I couldn't concentrate.   Fifteen of my friends came to support me.  I was overwhelmed because I didn't expect anyone really to be interested.  Thanks to Jeff, Joan, Donald, Julie, Pat, Marcia, Brian, Brian, Mark, Steve, Dan, Irene, Joanne, Katy and Kellie for your support.  The first few people went.  The stories were interesting, but the panel of inustry professionals didn't seem very impressed.  One of the panel members said she didn't like to see someone read from a piece of paper so I immediately changed gears.  They didn't care for the story that the cocky guy pitched.  I hate to admit that I was delighted by that, but arrogance is so unattractive and unnecessary.  Finally, it was my turn.  I walked up to the microphone, took a deep breath and just started to explain my story as if I was talking to friends.  The panel responded well.  One of the male members stated that he loved the sound of my voice and became lost in it.  He liked the pitch, but got lost in some of the details, but felt he would definitely call me back for a second meeting.  The second panelist seemed to have gotten lost as well.  By the third panelist, there was some confusion about the age of the little girl even though I stated this information in the first sentence of my pitch.  This panel member asked if this was clear to the audience and she was suprised when 95% of the audience responded that it had been made quite clear to them.  The last male panel member really liked the story.  Over all, I got good marks on the pitch and they found the story interesting.  I sat down feeling good that I had done a good job and did not throw up into the microphone.    Hadji's pitch was fantastic.  He basically just went up there and winged it and seemed to throw out all the advice we were given in our orientation.  His presentation was 180 degrees what it had been from what he had presented to us at the orientation.  I was very happy for him.  Afterwards, friends and other members from the audience came up and gave me positive feedback, which was nice to hear.  I told the guy who sat beside me that he did a good job and he was kind of chilly in his reception of my compliment.  Oh well!  Jeff, Joan, Donald, Julie, Joanne, Pat, Marcia and I went down to the Food Court of CNN Center and got a little something before the Awards Ceremony at the Library.  The general concensus was that Hadji and I would make the top three.  I felt the guy who sat beside me would make it too.  I didn't think his presentation was so great, but I thought the story was interesting and it had presented it fairly well.  However, I questioned if would even be able to win since he was one of two alternates that were allowed to pitch.  Ten of us were chosen as finalists and two alternates were chosen as well.  If the two alternates were allowed to compete as well, why were they called alternates?  If one of us had not showed up, just have nine compete.  It didn't really make any sense.  We went to the library and found seats in the theater.  The three winners for the Perfect Pitch were announced and they were Hadji, the guy who sat beside me and the other alternate who pitched her story about a toxic cat that passes lethal gas that kills people.  I was dumbfounded.  I thought she pitched fairly well, but what did the panelists see in such a crass story with details that were ever changing.  I took a deep breath, and I was okay.  There was no resentment or anger on my part.  I figured that things happen for a reason and I had complete trust that something good would come from it.  I felt genuine happiness for the winners and enjoyed the rest of the awards ceremony.  After the awards ceremony, someone immediately reassured me that I had been screwed and I stopped them right there.  The decision had been made. I did not want to fill myself with any negative energy.  I felt in my heart that some good would come out of it, even if it was not apparent to me now what that good was.  Greg came by and told me that I had placed fourth.  If I had placed one space higher, my script would have been sent to people in New York and Los Angeles.  He said that there had been a lot of talk about my story and one of the male panelists in particular had said that with such an original idea and the way I presented it, I had to be a great writer.  That was reassuring.  Greg told me to go down and speak to the panelists because they had really expressed an interest in me.  As I walked down, they were speaking with the girl who won and I started speaking with one of the other contestants.  He was floored that she won as well, but we traded contact information and are going to be in touch to look at each other's work.  When I finally did get to speak with the panelists, they were kind of distant.  Perhaps they thought I was going to attack them.  I thanked them for judging and said that I had learned a lot.  I didn't know what else to say and I sort of felt like I had asked someone to dance and had been rejected. Jeff told me that I didn't get down there quick enough and I missed my window of opportunity.  I'm not really sure what that means or what he judged it on. I congratulated the girl and Hadji, and once again, my well wishes were coolly received.  What was up with that?  One thing that I heard many of the other contestants say is that we had been coached to make our pitch in under a minute so the last two minutes could be used for answering questions from the panel and the audience.  However, the panelists kept saying that we should have given more information because we had three minutes.  It was if we were being criticized for doing as we had been told.  They were furious that both alternates had been allowed to pitch and win.  Although I was not furious, I understood what they were saying.  Another point of contention is that because they were the last two contestants to pitch, they had time to adjust their pitches based upon what transpired with the first contestants.  I had not thought of this and there was some truth in this too.  By the time people were throwing out conspiracy theories that the winners included an African-American, an Asian-American and a woman, I had to excuse myself.  I was not going down the path because that just leads to people being pissed off and getting stuck.  At that point, we decided to go eat.  After all the time and energy I had put into the contest the past week, preparation for the yard sale, work and the actual yard sale, I was tired.  I should have gone to the closing night party after the last film, but I knew I wouldn't be worth anything.  Jeff, Donald, Julie, Joanne and I went to Ted's Montanna Grill and had dinner and then Jeff and I came home and turned in.  I'm still sleepy today.  All in all, I was pleased with what I did.  I got off my butt and finished my second full-length screenplay.  I was selected as a finalist.  Industry professionals were happy with my pitch presentation and story idea.  I placed fourth out of twelve people.  I had fifteen friends come out on a Saturday afternoon to support me because they belived in my creative talents.  And most importantly, in spite of all the work I had put into this contest, I was proudest of the fact that I did not spiral into a pit of blame and resentment. I had reached a space in my life where I was not at the mercy of disappointment. In fact, I could be happy for the other winners and still let the experience inspire me to continue to move forward with new projects.  That's pretty good stuff!

       FALLING OFF THE ROOF   Jeff never ceases to amaze me.  Last night, he broiled fish in the toaster oven with the toasting lever.  Is there nothing that man cannot do?!  As we were eating dinner, Jeff opened a newsletter from his former church and asked if I remembered a certain man.  I told him I did not.  He told me that he used to dress up like a clown, but his personality was sort of manic depressive so you never knew if you were getting Chuckles the Clown or Sad Sack the Clown.  Anyway, he died last weekend.  I asked how and Jeff replied that he fell off the roof.  I asked if he fell on anything.  Jeff looks at me and replies that he fell off the roof.  Thinking he did not understand my question, I asked him again if the man fell on anything.  Jeff leans forward and speaks slowly as if talking to a retarded person or a foreigner, "He fell off the roof."  I replied, "Yes, I understand that, but did he fall on anything, such as a fence or wall or a large spike that just happened to be situated next to the roof?"  Then Jeff begins to tell me that you can fall off even something as small as a ladder and you will most certainly die if you fall on your head, which I understood.  However, I don't typically fall on my head so my first thought when the man fell off the roof is that he fell on something and broke his neck or back.  I have to agree with Jeff, we do have some communication issues at times, but it will never overshadow the fact that I just love the little guy.  What can I say?  He does something to me. (As in the Cole Porter song, not a specific sexual act.)  Jeff read the screenplay last night and really liked it.  I was a bit worried because he can be my toughest critic.  However, if he liked it, that's a good sign.  It's amazing how many typos I missed that were right smack in front of my face, but I haven't had any distance from it and I have noticed that typos are much more apparent once you print out any document than when you read it on the monitor.  It was fun sitting in the floor beside him as he read my script.  He did suggest that I change one small thing in two different scenes, which I thought were good suggestions.  He told me I only had three incidents where he felt that I was pornographic.  Granted, pornographic for Jeff could easily fly in a PG movie or be on TV, so I need to consider this carefully.  None of the passages has anything to do with sex, by the way.  I'll correct the typos this afternoon and print out a few copies for tomorrow.  My pitch is ready and I'll practice it periodically through out the day.  I feel ready.  I am excited.  I also feel unusually prepared.  Regardless, I'm just going to have fun tomorrow and enjoy myself.  I've got a few files to prepare for work today.  I should be able to wrap up a little early this afternoon and prepare for the yard sale.  I'm also having lunch with Ryan today, which should be fun.  We always have interesting conversations about politics, life and chocolate.

       WHAT DAY IS IT?   First, I would like to begin by saying that I don't particularly like for anything sexual to be done to my nostrils.  Whew!  I'm glad I got that off my chest.  Jay and Susan arrived yesterday with the baby, Owen Edward.  I have to say he is the prettiest baby I've ever seen.  He wasn't all wrinkled like a lot of babies are and I didn't come home and feel compelled to iron.  Owen had on a little tobogan and it made hime look like litle a wee li'l hip hop artist.  Susan is moving slow after the C-section, but doing well.  It had been a difficult pregnancy in the beginning.  Both she and Jay were exhausted and only managed to have seven hours of sleep since Saturday night when her water broke.  They introduced Sadie, their Saint Bernard, to Owen.  It went okay, but not as well as they hoped and they are laying low today to help Sadie adjust to the new member of the family.  Jeff and I made them dinner and took it over there last night and we have other neighbors who will be taking meals today and tomorrow.  I live in such a neat neighborhood.  I'm still coordinating yard sale preparation amongst the neighbors.  Jeff and I will price everything Friday night so we can just take it out shortly before 8am on Saturday morning.  We have a lot of neighbors participating and I think we'll have a good time and pass on stuff to people who need it.  I finished editing and revising the first half of the script last night.  So far, I'm very pleased.  I'm sure that if I took another look at it in a week from now, I'd probably see other things I would change, but is an artist ever really through with any of his creations? I added a dinner scene at the beginning because there needed to be a scene where the little girl tries to drive the boyfriend away.  It didn't turn out the way I imagined, it turned out better.  I believe that if you know the purpose of the paragraph or the scene you are writing and just start doing it, it will form as it should... typically in better ways than you can imagine.  I have revised dialogue here and there to make it tighter or flow better.  I should have the rest of the script ready for Jeff to look over this evening and I'll make my final revisions tonight so I can print several copies of the script out tomorrow.  I'm told that I will most likely be asked for copies of my script by industry people at the Atlanta Film Festival and I should bring a few extra copies.  I'm also going to make some business cards with my contact information for writing and include the URL for my on-line portfolio.  I'll post a link to the script on my on-line portfolio after Saturday so people can take a look at the script if they want to.    Work has been incredible.  The amount of business I have received last week and this week has quadrupled over what I was doing since I started working on my own in March.  I'm very excited, but cannot explain it.  Realtors who would not give me the time of day a few weeks ago or now my biggest fans.  I'm amazed at how much I'm still learning and yet it's amazing to see how confident I am now as compared to even a few months ago.  I'm very grateful and enjoy helping the clients who didn't think they would be able to get a loan.  The money will be nice too.  In a completely unrelated note, I'm shocked at how completly excited I am about the DVD release of the first season of  Wonder Woman  with Lynda Carter.  I wonder if it will still be as good as I remember almost thirty years later?  I guess time will tell.

       A FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT   You've probably noticed that I haven't been posting as much lately. As some of you may know, I have been working furiously on finishing my screenplay for the Perfect Pitch Contest on Saturday.  I had originally wanted to be finished this past weekend, but I had some unexpected things come up that slowed me down.  However, it doesn't matter because I have finished.  Well, I've finished the first draft.  What happens now is that I will print the script out and reread it first for typos and other mistakes and then I will reread it to see how it flows together and to make sure each scene advances the story along and the characters are properly developed.  I have to say, my characters surprised me.  The mother ended up playing a bigger part in the story than I had anticipated and the next door neighbor ended up not being in as many pivotal scenes as I had imagined.  Still, the little, the mother, the neighbor and his boyfriend are all very good parts.  I've been thinking Naomi Watts would be great as the mother, but I think Nicole Kidman would do a fine job too.  My only concern is that she is such a huge star that she might overshadow the part and the movie.  I also think it would be fun to see what Ben Afleck and Matt Damon would do with the neighbor and boyfriend parts.  I think they could have fun with it.  They seem to handle the rumors about their relationship in a good natured way and it would allow them the opportunity to grow as actors.  I would probably cast Matt as the neighbor and Ben as the boyfriend.  The one character who really stood out for me is the little girl's best friend, Emma.  She really turned out to be a hoot.   The ghost of the father grew quite a bit too.  It's interesting that some of the scenes I initially imagined didn't quite work on paper as I had anticpated.  Some were cut because they would have added too much time to the script.  Others just didn't work.  Some were funny, but really didn't contribute to moving the story forward so they had to go.  The most interesting thing was how the final climax came completely out of the blue today.  It grew out of an analogy the father used and it was just perfect and it really worked.  All in all, I'm feeling really jazzed right now.  I feel good about the story.  It's funny, but it's also very emotional at the end.  There's a heart to it that surprised me.  Now, tomorrow when I begin revising and editing, I may freak out and think it's the worst thing I've ever written.  I hear this is normal.  I still have three days left so I should be okay.  Once I have finished the revisions and have the final draft, I'll make it available to anyone who wants to read it.  Wish me luck!

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?   I went with Jeff to The Home Depot on Saturday night to pick up some odds and ends.  Basically, I just go for support and to push the cart.    Why do they call it "The Home Depot?"  You never hear anyone say, "I have to go to The Home Depot."  No.  They say, "I'm going to Home Depot. Does my hair look okay?  No, I don't need anything, I'm just going to pick up a date."  Well, The Home Depot is a very cruisy place for gay men.  "Where are the work gloves?  They've moved them!  I'll never find them!  The world as we know it is rapidly coming to an end!"  "Why don't we ask someone where they are?"  "No, let's walk over to this section of the store together and retrace my footsteps in a place where I know they are not."  "Excuse me, sir.  If I were work gloves, where would I live in the store?"  "Aisle 12."  We reverse our direction and find the gloves on ailse 12.  However, I did let him down in the check out department.  It seems that I didn't get the cart close enough to the check out counter and put the items on the counter in the right order.  And it is so obvious to even a retarded person, you know!  However, he had a headache, so I cut him some slack.  Most people would just take aspirin.  However, Jeff kept forgetting to take aspirin.  I don't really understand that because if my head is pounding, I'm not going to forget the headache until it goes away.  Then again, we all function in different ways so I will not judge.  As we were tooling around in the garden department, a small black boy ran up beside me and wedged his way between my cart and a garden pond.  He peered down into the water with astonishment and then turned to look at me and said, "Flah flof flah flah flah."  "Excuse me?"  "Flah flof flah flah flah."  At this point, it occured to me that he might be (a) retarded; or (b) have a speech impediment.  I admired his bright you spirit to choose to live with joy in the face of adversity.  About that time his parents showed up and his father said, "Flof!  FLOF!  Flah floo fla fla."  Then the mother piped in, "Flu, fludda flu flu flu."  At that point I was flabergasted at the kid's ability to mimic these people.  He spoke flah flah fluently... and without an accent.  I was impressed.  As I moved my cart away and followed Jeff over to pine bark, I remembered a girl that I used to work with back at TRW.  My friend, Susan, will remember her, albeit her name escapes me now.  She once made a comment about a vendor who called in that I didn't quite understand, but after hearing this little flah flah family, I finally understood.  This girl released her call, spun her chair around and said, "She talk like she got shit in her mouth."  "Pardon?"  "She talk like she got shit in her mouth."  And she was right.  It was like this little family learned to talk with those sytrofoam peanuts in its mouth or was just too lazy to use their tongue to deftly whip those consonants off the back of their teeth.  I smiled as I pushed my cart on and we headed into the air conditioning supplies.  "Where's the air filters?  Don't they believe any 24x60 air filters anymore?!"  I smiled and said, "Let's ask someone."

       IRONMAN MIA   There is a bond between a boy and his Timex Ironman Triathlon watch that cannot be broken.  Imagine my shock when my watch disappeared.  After Joel and Meredith returned home, I noticed that I had misplaced my watch somewhere as we had all shifted around to make room for them.  I felt as if I was adrift at sea with oars.  I had no stopwatch or timer.  And when I ran, I felt naked.  I wondered where it could be and after weeks, I let go of the matter figuring it would turn up again one day.  Last night as I fell asleep, the idea that I should check one more time under the bed ocurred to me.  I slept fituflly last night, tossing and turning the way skinned rattlesnakes do when thrown into a hot pan over a fire.  At 5:30am I heard a softly muffled, "Beep, beep!  Beep, beep!"  It was the alarm from my trusty Timex going off.  Then it stopped.  I thought I must be dreaming.  A few minutes later, it went off again.  It sounded as if it was coming from under the bed.  "I must check under the bed," I thought to myself.  "I must find my watch."  Once again, sleep overcame me.  When I woke up, I made the bed and recalled the bizarre dream from last night.  I got down on my hands and knees and looked under the bed.  No watch.  But it had seemed so real.  Finally, on a gut feeling, I moved down to the end of the bed and saw a black shadow hidden behind a box.  I reached out for it in faith.  Sure enough, it was my Ironman.  "Hello, old pal," I said as I slipped it back on my wrist.  It chirped, happy to be home again.

       IT STARTED WITH EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL   As I was writing tonight, I suddenly had a hankering to listen to ebtg, or as they were known before their huge hit,  Missing , Everything But The Girl.  I opened my closet door and found Tracey and Ben right there in the "E" section.  I pulled all the CDs out and shuffled through them to find just the one I wanted.  Strangely enough, I was drawn to 1994's Amplified Heart, which is not one of my favorite albums at all, but I am especially fond of  Rollercoaster  and  Troubled Mind .  It is a very acoustic album and it did not seem to move me at a time when dance music seemed to be the only thing that would.  I had actually allowed the album to be released and refrained from buying it for a few months before I picked up my own copy.  It scandalous the way people talked about it.  "He actually allowed other people to own it before he did.  What he will he do next?"  1994 was a volatile year in my life.  I had left a four year relationship with someone who was not just a friend, but not quite a lover either.  It had always been unfathomable to me to leave any relationship, but there was a quiet calm in the chaos of my heart that said I was doing the right thing.  I moved in with a friend who turned out be a nudist whose idea of fun was reading biographies of presidential first ladies and singing along to Cher and Celine Dion while ironing in the nude.  A  bout this time, I decided that I should get out more and was pleased when I received one of the leads in a revival of Neil Simon's  Barefoot In The Park  except this production changed Jane Fonda's character to a male and it was about a gay couple.  It was great fun, but whenever people heard about it, they would always ask, "Did you have to wear a dress?"  "No.  I was gay, not transgendered or a transvestite."  I would speak in a firm and audible voice as if I was addressing the elderly or a clerk at 7-11.    The summer was long and hot and I did too many things, and in retrospect, too many people.  I always seemed to enter into a Whore of Babylon stage after a relationship ended.  I was searching for something, but not quite sure what it was.  At times, validation that I was attractive and sexy were pleasing, but it was something else.  Lust is as powerful as cheesecake calling to a dieter from the refrigerator in the middle of the night.  Afterwards, I would like at my partner(s) and think, "Gee, that really wasn't that good. I should have held out for Sara Lee."  I began making mix tapes of 80's music that summer.  They were like aural photograph albums that captured bits and pieces of my history.  I would arrange the songs in a certain order on each tape and then play them.  I would close my eyes and try to remain very still and I could almost capture the moment again with all of my senses.  At times it was somewhat stressful knowing just where to put a certain song.  For example, Cruel Summer by Bananarama was released in the summer of 1983 in the UK, but was released in the summer of 1984 in the US.  Which tape should it go on?  I also spent a lot of time at the pool that year.  I found that I actually enjoyed going down to the pool about 10pm and swimming for 20 minutes or so.  It was typically deserted and a nice way to wind down my mind and body for the evening.  It felt so good to come back to my apartment and climb in bed and pull the sheet up around me.  One Friday night, I swam late and met a guy down at the pool reading  The Celestine Prophecy  by James Redfield.  In an effort to overcome my chronic shyness, I asked him about the book and we struck up a conversation and we talked for several hours.  We eventually stood by the gate of the pool in a pefunctory attempt to go our separate ways, but we were enjoying each other's company.  Perhaps it wasn't for the healthiest of reasons.  He came back to my place and spent the night.  To tell the truth, it wasn't a night about sex.  We played around a bit, but it didn't go too far.  Mainly, we talked and slept and held one another.  In the morning, we took a shower and he dressed to leave for his weekend job.  I remember he sat me down on his lap and he looked into my eyes and I looked into his.  I could see something that looked like treasure in murky water.  I could almost make it out, but the undulating motion of the water made it impossible to see.  In hindsight, he saw joy and happiness and expecation in my eyes and you could almost smell the disappointment on him.  He had just been cast aside by a younger man, whom he obviously still cared for and as much as he wanted to dive into the possibilities with me, there had not been enough time to heal.    It was an odd relationship.  We lived in the same apartment complex.  Sometimes he would call me in the evening, sometimes he wouldn't.  Sometimes he would ask me to come over and spend the night and sometimes he wouldn't.  Rarely did we go out on weekends because he worked part-time as a salesman in a department store.  In time, I saw that he was a very angry man beneath the surface.  I wanted to soothe that anger, but that only stoked the fires more.  It went beyond the younger man of two months ago. It went much further and deeper than that.  I felt that I must always be available in case he should need me and would always suffer when I would see the light from the televison through his bedroom window and he did not call me to come join him.  I could smell the disappointment all the way in my apartment.  I went to San Francisco for the first time in September of that year.  I wanted him to miss me.  He wanted me to have fun.  I wanted to pull his string so he would say, "I love you.  I'll miss you," but it was like his string was broken.  I walked around Union Square listening to Sade sing  Love Is Stronger Than Pride .  The words tried to speak to me, but they made me just focus on the beats all the more.  I came back on my 27th birthday.  The reception he gave me was more than I had expected and it gave me false hope.  A few weeks later he gave me an expensive camera as a belated birthday gift.  He had gone out of his way to send a card and some cassettes to the previous boy for his birthday.  He attended my own birthday party and didn't even give me a card.  In the heat of an argument, I played the birthday card card.  In his eyes, it was about material possessions.  In my eyes, it was about taking me for granted.  The gift was to appease his own guilt and make him feel better.  It ended in the fall when I ran into him with his new boyfriend at a viewing of the aids quilt.  I walked up to him and said hello.  They were holding hands.  I introduced myself and was polite and then excused myself.  I went outside and held onto a tree, feeling like I would vomit all of my internal organs up at any moment.  I felt betrayed.  I felt hoodwinked.  I was angry with myself because I knew something was wrong and I had asked, but he never would say anything.  I thought it was my fault and I should try harder.  We spoke on the phone that night and he told me he was really put out with me.  He did fine job placing the guilt back onto me and it took several months to dig my way out of that snakepit.  I blamed myself because he couldn't tell me the truth.  He told me just enough of what I wanted to hear to keep me around and waiting, but never enough to let me know how things were between us so I could move on.  Sure, it would have hurt, but I would have gotten over it.  Instead, I experienced the pain of seeing the light from the television in his bedroom each night and the car of his new and improved boyfriend with lemon fresh borax parked next to his apartment when I left for work each morning.  That fall, I decided that I was tired of pain.  My friend, Tacy, and I began reading A Course In Miracles (ACIM) and listening to lectures by Marianne Williamson on cassette.  This Jewish girl from Texas would talk about these teachings that Jesus channeled through a middle-aged, Jewish, agnostic pspychiatrist over a period of years.  It sounded like something out of a science fiction movie, but the teachings were remarkable.  Nothing is real or has meaning except for what you give it.  I began to ungive meaning to him.  I said I forgave him even when I felt I didn't and in time I did forgive him.    A year and a half later, after he had moved out of that apartment, I was planning my move to Atlanta.  I lay in the living room floor journaling and wondered if I had any unfinished business with him.  I was quiet for a moment and then wrote down, if there is unfinished business between us, then let us meet again.  I closed the journal and went to Target to pick up toiletries and literally ran right smack into him.  He helped me pick up my tooth paste and other items.  I smiled at him and cautiously he warmed up to me.  I told him I was leaving to move to Atlanta in another two months and wondered if would like to go to dinner.  We went the following week and we had a good time.  There was no expecation on anyone's part.  He had found another young lost boy to take care of in his new apartment complex and that's when I figured it out.  I didn't need to be taken care of.  I wanted to take care of him and help him.  To him, that did not compute.  He didn't know what to do with me.  We ended the evening in my living room as we sat on the futon.  He thanked me for the evening and hugged me.  I could feel that he was genuinely glad that I did not haror any ill feelings toward him.  He kissed me on the forehead and then on the lips. I watched him walk out of my life and closed the door.  He was one of the most painful experiences I ever lived through, but never before had someone so shaken up the dirt and allowed me to find all the buried treasures in my own excavation.  I discovered why I did some of the things I did, worked through those issues and moved on.  The year ended on a melancholy note.  I bought the new Kylie Minogue album entitled simpley  Kylie Minogue .  The songs  Confide In Me  and  Put Yourself In My Place  captured exactly how I was feeling.  Tell me your pain and just you wait, matey, one day you'll get yours in turn.  On Christmas Eve 1994, I drove to a stranger's home.  He lived in a mobile home, albeit a nice one.  I didn't find him sexy or even likable, but I found something attractive about so that I wouldn't have to go.  For some reason, I didn't want to be alone on Christmas Eve that year.  In the morning, I woke up and thought, "I should have held out for Sara Lee."  I didn't know why I was feeling what I was, but I took a quick shower, changed and drove to my parents' house.  As we opened a presents and feasted on turkey, I couldn't help wonder what my family would think of where I had come from that morning.  I wondered why so many people around me thought I was so together and strong when I felt like a house of cards on the inside.  At one point, I pressed my face against the glass patio door and felt my cheek become chilled.  Surely, the next year had to be together.  Determined, I pulled away from the glass and went to secure a chocolate-marshmallow Santa Clause.

       THESE DREAMS....   I don't normally remember my dreams, but last night I did.  Perhaps it's because I was asking for my subconscious to work on a particularly sticky spot in the script.    In the first dream, someone told me that I had nice Jewish muscle.  This sort of bewildered me since I'm not Jewish, I was wearing clothes that hid my physique and the conversation was about everything but muscle.  However, instead of just asking what Jewish muscle is, I just pretended that I understood perfectly and was completey oblvious to the rest of the conversation as I tried to unravel the puzzle of Jewish muscle.  Jeff says that dreams are basically our brains flushing themselves at the end of the day.  Anything we came across in the media or a friend may have discussed is privy to make a guest appearance. I have resisted this theory before, but perhaps he's onto something.  Yesterday, I visited the link of an artist who shared that she had miscarried and discussed how she was torn between telling people about the loss.  She discussed the experience from many different view points, including what I interpreted as  Jewish spiritual perspective.  Perhaps this stuck in mind because I was inspired by the way that she chose to embrace this difficult time with strength and courage.  It is she, not I, who has Jewish muscle.  The other dream was not so poignant.  Aliens came down in Dallas and my neighbors and I had to make our way back across Interstate 20 to Atlanta in secret.  There were lots of big sand hills and the aliens had stolen all the hand soap in all the gas station restrooms along the way.  However, they did not realize there was a convenience store clerk resistance.  Sometimes I amuse myself without even trying.

       PUMPING   As I was doing research on freak deaths for my screenplay last night, an article from Thailand caught my eye.  The writer was waxing on about the evils of pumping among teenage Thai boys.  At first, I thought this was just another way of referring to masturbation and I thought he should just leave them alone.  After all, the teenage Thai boys could be spilling their seed into teenage Thai girls and impregnating them and retired Americans and Europeans are already handling that job quite well.  I was about to left-click the back button and return to Google when I discovered what pumping actually is.  Evidently, some Thai boys insert the end of a bicycle pump into their anus and pump their rectal cavity full of air.  I assume that this produces some sort of pleasurable feeling, but I would be concerned that once the pump was removed that the boy might fly around the room like a runaway balloon.  The boy mentioned in the article worked his way up to a double pump and on a dare from his friends, snuck into a gas station and inserted the air chuck from one of those air/water machines into his anus.  No, he did not rapidly fill his rectal cavity with water by accident.  After inserting a coin into the machine, the air was rapidly propeled with great force inside his body.  I would think that the pressure of the air into his colon and internal organs would do some damage, but it seems that with all of the gases inside his rectum, it caused him to explode.  Now this sounds a bit far fetched if you ask me, but I met with a client yesterday who is a massage therapist and she confirmed that if you perform a massage with a counter-clockwise circular motion on the abdomen, you can constipate them for days.  Sometimes the things that just sound way out there, end up being completely true.  The article ended with a female witness saying that she thought she saw fireworks going off. It certainly creates a picture in my mind.

       ODE TO A CHOCOLATE PECAN PIE   Jeff was out of the country helping third world people build ovens.  I was still a Web design student at The Art Institute of Atlanta and to this day, I still don't understand why the "The" in "The Art Institute of Atlanta" is capitalized.  Sometimes I used to lay awake in bed mulling it over in my head until I thought I might lose my mind, but I digress.  I was typing code on my computer.  TIPPITY-TYPE-TYPE!  TIPPETY-TYPE-TYPE!  The door bell rang and it was Jeff from down the street.  Did I want to go to dinner?  Sure. We drove over to East Atlanta in his retro station wagon as he inhaled on a cigarette and introduced me to he who is known as Radiohead.    We dined at new restaurant called Twang.  I liked to say the name and did so many times that evening. I would always say the name with an echo as if I had just tapped a tuning fork.  "TWANGGGGG!"    We had a delicious, unforgettable dinner.  (Don't ask me what it was.)  For dessert, Jeff chose watermelon sorbet, but with one look at the menu I saw the one word that makes me smile bigger than a cat seeing a quad amputee rodent hopping across the kitchen floor.... chocolate pecan pie.  Mmmmmm....  I can close my eyes and smell it even now.  My tongue longs to know the textures of the pecan ridges and melted chocolate chunks again.  I ate it slowly and investigated every crevice of my fork with my urgent tongue the way most bio-hazard teams mop up a toxic spill.  The next day, lust was in my heart when I thought about that pie.  "I must have it again," I thought to myself.  When Jeff returned, we flew over to East Atlanta in my Miata, eager to share the secret joys of such a heavenly concoction.  With each passing block, I could feel myself once again experiencing its chocolatey pecanessence, but alas, when we walked up to the door of the restaurant, it was boarded up, closed and cold.  There was no longer any warmnth from freshly baked chocolate pecan pie issuing forth from Mama's oven.  I grabbed the door firmly and shook it so hard that the alarm went off.  Defeated, I hung my head and wept.  "Curse those Roman barbarians!"  Jeff pulled his baseball cap down on his head and drug me down the street to Grant Central and the police arrived.  Inside, he ordered a pizza for us to share.  "It's a pie to," he offered cheerfully.  I half-smiled back and thought to myself, "Yes, but it's not the same thing."

       IS MICKEY MOUSE A WUS?   I stopped over at Andymatic for a visit and he is at conference for creativity coaches, C urlLink oachamatic .  He has created a new blog where you can read about his adventures in the Orlando area.  I think I may want to be a coach some day.  It's somewhere between best friend and a psychiatrist.  Andy commented on how Mickey Mouse is boring in comparison to everybody's favorite opera-singing, cross-dressing, carrot-crunchy wascally wabbit, Bugs Bunny.  I have to agree.  Cartoons have made me what I am today.  Every once in a while, I find myself singing to myself and I'll hear these words come out of my mouth:   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, abracapo-cus La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, pocus-cadabra   It's from the cartoon with the vampire who changes into a bat when he says abracadabra and back into human form when he says hocus pocus.  Then Bugs mixes up the words and turns him into a half human, half bat creature.  Inevitablly, I'll look up and see people staring at me in bewilderment, but occasionally I'll see someone giving me a knowing smile.  I know what song they will be singing the rest of the day.

       JOAN'S GOOD NEWS   I called Joan back after I hung up with Jaspreet.  She received a call about her resume from a chiropractor's office and they want to talk to her tomorrow.  This is the first call back she has had about her resume. It's amazing what happens in your life when you change your thinking.  We were discussing Jennifer Lopez for a moment and then decided to see what our J-Lo names would be.  Joan would be J-Mu.  Hers isn't bad, but mine is awful. I'm J-Blo!

       BEASTMOMMA SPEAKS   Jaspreet, AKA Beastmomma, asked me to call her tonight to get the information for her pre-qualification for a mortgage.  I found it interesting that Adam from The C-Blog will be visiting in a week or so and I was about to speak with Beastmomma, both of whom are people I would have never met without my blog.  Jaspreet and I had a wonderful conversation.  We took care of the loan information first and then discussed her first boyfriend from the eighth grade, George Walter Booth.  Isn't that a great name?  She met him in Catholic school and they carried on a torrid hand-holding affair behind the nuns' bad habits.  She admitted to not being an outdoorsy girl.  We laughed a lot and discussed some deep things but never got too deep in anything.  I'm looking forward to lunch on Sunday.  I have to figure out what her rising sign is for horoscope.  Oddly enough, I never read horoscopes.  She told me that I had a slight southern drawl, which is interesting.  Most people don't think I have a southern accent.

       PLIGHT OF THE PIANO   Jeff and I went over to Elaine's house to help her move her piano and some other furniture to the house next door.  It actually turned out to be easier than we anticipated.  Jeff was smart enough to suggest that we remove one panel of the fence and just walk the furniture through instead of going up and down both sets of steep steps.  We were also able to avoid loading furniture in a truck, driving across town and unloading it.  Elaine refused to watch while we moved the piano, which she believes is an extension of her body.  If that were true, it could have just walked itself next door.  Once inside the house, I was looking at Elaine's books.  I did not see the copy of  Methods Of Torture And Execution Through The Middle Ages  that I bought for her as a Christmas present.  As soon as I saw it, I immediately thought of Elaine.

       POWER FAILURE AT POWER CORE   I had a very hard time getting up for the PowerCore meeting this morning, yet somehow I managed and made it to the 7am meeting.  I felt very drained and dazed this morning when the mentor coordinator asked me what I learned at the new member orientation luncheon last week.  Put on the spot, I responded, "I learned that I had my choice between a barbecue sandwich and a grilled chicken sandwich."  Everyone laughed and it gave me time to download that file and remember hearing about a testimonial letter for the first time.  Whew!  At the end of the meeting, we each give a referral trigger, which is a short statement about what makes us different and a good candidate to give business referrals to.  Today's question was what is your biggest distraction and how do you overcome it.  It was pretty dry and people gave very serious answers.  When it was my turn, I stood up and said, "The biggest distraction I have is female clients throwing themselves at me.  I cannot tell you how many times I have been taking a loan application when a female client interrupts me and says, 'God I love the way you hold a pen.'"  Then I gave my real answer.  It lightened the mood and got everyone's interest.    By the end of the meeting, they had decided that I was in the wrong profession and should be on television.  There was talk about me trying out for some reality stand-up comedy show.  It was flattering, but how do I explain to them that I cannot make myself be funny.  What I think and what I say isn't created to be funny, it's just me expressing myself and my thoughts.  There's no agenda behind it; it's just me.  There was actually a time when I remember asking God to make me like everyone else so I wouldn't stand out with my sense of humor, but eventually I just accepted it and just allow myself to be who I am.  Of course, now I'm drawing a correlation between expressing myself and expressing breast milk.  I'd better stop now.

       FOR THE RECORD   I hate to be called dude.  There, I've said it.  Boy, do I feel better to have that off my chest.  It just sounds so stupid to me.  Maybe it's too close to doo, as in doo doo.  I don't know.  I do like being called buddy though... or even bud.  I'm sure it says a lot about me psychologically.

       JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO GO BACK INTO CULT OF JEF....   Through a strange twist of fate, I found one of my favorite websites that had gone MIA for awhle:  urlLink http://www.sharkattack.com/ .  It has a bunch of information on shark attacks from around the world and pictures of people who have been attacked and what they have recovered from sharks' stomachs. I love sharks.  They get a bad rep, when in fact, they are really the victims.  So many sharks are caught each year by Japanese fishermen who cut off their fins and throw their carcas back in the water to die... just to make shark fin soup!  Whenever we go into the water, we enter their domain and we take our chances.  I'll never forget the media frenzy over that boy in Florida who was attacked and it became the Sumemr of the Shark.  In reality, there were less shark attacks that year than on average.  Secondly, it turns out the boy was wading where his uncle was shark fishing.  I thought it was odd that a man could wrestle a six foot bull shark onto shore.

       AND THE THEN TELEPHONE RANG....   So I'm standing in the doorway of the dining room whilst fellow History Committee members are asking me why Jeff doesn't have the correct dates on the captions for next year's historic photograph calendar.  I'm just about to say, "Look, my job was to compile and order the images.  I didn't even know that he had even written any captions yet.  You obviously think that just because we are in a relationship and live together that we actually communicate," but then the telephone rang.  It was Bonnie and she was calling to tell me that the builder is ready for Robert and I to be on site at the subdivision on the weekends beginning this weekend.  Now, I'm very excited because I can pick up a lot of leads and business by being there.  Then it hits me that the next two weekends are two of the busiest weekends of my life.  I'll have to talk to Robert about scheduling tomorrow.  I can work this Saturday, but the yard sale and the Perfect Pitch Contest are next Saturday.  I can't work this Sunday because I already promised to go to lunch with Beastmomma, the original Curvacious Indian Diva (CID) this Sunday.  Of course, next Sunday I could work, but I Adam from the C-Blog and his friends will be staying with me.  I guess I may have to be a rude host and work.  Hopefully, it will only be a few hours.  Here's the interesting thing; I've started saying affirmations for fifteen minutes every morning regarding work and I'll be damned if the goals I am supporting with those affirmations are actually coming to pass.  It really drives home the fact that our minds are indeed little computers and we program them all day long regardless of whether we are conscious of it or not.  I received a large envelope from Capitol One today that contained a letter stating they had recently sent me another application for a platinum Master Card just like the one they had included in the big envelope.  They had actually taken a sealed credit card application in a second envelope like they had sent me two weeks before and sent it to me in a bigger envelope.  I thought this was the strange, but interesting market approach.  In the end, I put it through the paper shredder.  I have enough credit as it is.  If there is one thing I have learned in the mortgage business, you can have too much credit.

       TEMPER, TEMPER    My friend, Steve, sent me this and it's a gentle, but funny reminder to keep our cool at all times.   A stressed-out woman on a busy boulevard was tailgating a man. Suddenly, the light turned yellow, just in front of him. He did the right thing, stopping at the crosswalk, even though he could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection.  The tailgating woman hit the roof, and the horn, screaming in frustration as she missed her chance to get through the intersection with him. As she was still in mid-rant, she heard a tap on her window and looked up into the face of a very serious police officer.  The officer ordered her to exit her car with her hands up. He took her to the police station where she was searched, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a cell.  After a couple of hours, a policeman approached the cell and opened the door. She was escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was waiting with her personal effects.  He said, "I'm very sorry for this mistake. You see , I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn, flipping the guy off in front of you, and cussing a blue streak at him. I noticed the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Follow Me to Sunday School' bumper sticker, and the chrome-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk.  Naturally, I assumed you had stolen the car."

       PERFECT DAY   Business has been picking up and I'm glad.  I've been focusing on the positive, setting new goals and trying new things.  It seems to be paying off and I have already surpassed my goals for the month.  It's a bit overcast today, but the temperature is so pleasant.  Buddy has decided to spend the day inside in her little cat bed. I think she's just trying to throw me off.  She's plotting something.  I started the South Beach Diet again yesterday.  I got a bit too crazy after the Canadians came and I was having trouble settling down.  Needless to say, I wasn't feeling very good physically.  Processed foods and refined sugars make me feel awful after I eat them.  It's amazing how much better I feel already.  I bought the South Beach Diet Cook Book with one of the Borders gift cards my sister sent me for my birthday last year.  I also picked up David Sedaris' new book too. They were both on sale so I didn't have to pay a dime.  I'm always amazed at all of the delicious foods you can make from other things.  For example, you can make mashed potatoes out of cauliflower.  It tastes just like real mashed potatoes, but without all the startches.  I was shocked to discover that my BMI is right at the top of what it should be for my age and height.  It's the same situation with my height.  I'm in good shape, I just want be in a little better shape.  We're supposed to go to the beach sometime before the summer's over and I would like to look a little more fabulous than I do now and maintain it.  Why is it that people in general find it so hard to eat in the way they should to take care of their bodies?  We brush our teeth.  We go to the doctor.  Why is it so hard to try to eat the foods that are good for us and eat only the other foods in moderation?

       THE TROUBLE WITH JUNIOR   I woke up this mornng feeling very inspired so I put on my running shoes, grabbed my MP3 player and walked down to the high school to do some cardio.  It was a cool morning and I did a mile around the track before walking a half mile and then running another mile, etc.  It feels like I'm getting more of a work out and burn more body fat.  There were several women there walking and jogging.  One had brought her children.  As I ran around the track, one of the little boys would speed run up beside me and pass me like he was racing.  At first, it was cute, but after a while, I thought to myself, "Isn't he to young to be compensating for an undersize penis?"  Fortunately, he gave out after the first mile because near the end he would run out frome behind the bleachers and cut over inches in front of me and I'm almost ran over him.  After my five miles, I headed home.  I noticed Junior asleep on the bleachers,  I guess that half mile he must have run wore him out.

       DIANE WANTS    After I moved to Atlanta in the summer of 1996, I joined a screenwriters' group that would meet on Saturdays at the Fulton County Public Library across from the High Museum of Art.  We had a contest to write a ten-minute screenplay about characters stuck in an elevator with a serial killer.  I actually wrote two different screenplays - one comedy and one drama.  This is the dramatic one.  Well, it's actually a suspense-thriller.  I thought y'all might enjoy it.  I'll see if I can find the comdey screenplay.           INT.  OFFICE BUILDING - AFTERNOON         An attractive woman in her thirties, DIANE, runs out of         office, slamming door behind her.  She pushes the button         for the elevator repeatedly.  Impatient, she lights up a         cigarette.  As she inhales, her eyes rest upon a ?No         Smoking? sign on the wall.                             DIANE         Deal with it!  It?s an emergency.         Elevator door opens. Diane steps into -         INT.  ELEVATOR - AFTERNOON         DIANE presses button for the lobby.  Camera zooms slowly         into her face as she continues to smoke her cigarette         rapidly.                                                          DISOLVE TO:         INT.  OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES EARLIER                             DIANE                  Jack, we can work this out.                             JACK                  What?s to work out, Diane?                             DIANE                  I know things have been difficult                   these past few months, but I know once                   the baby is born... our marriage will                   be different.                             JACK                  It?s already different.  I?ll be home                   to pick up my clothes this evening.                             DIANE                      (laughing and crying at same                        time)                  Why are you doing this?  Why are you                   trying to hurt me?                             JACK                  Hurt you?!         JACK slams his fist against the wall.                             JACK (cont?d)         Who in the hell is trying to hurt who?!                             DIANE                  Jack, you have to understand.  It?s                   only natural for a woman to want to                   give her husband a child.  I want to                   give you a child... a son.                             JACK                  Oh, I see.  Why didn?t I see it                   before?  You?re doing it all for me.                    Cut the crap, Diane!  It?s all for                   you.  Everything?s always been for                   you.  You?ve always gotten everything                   you wanted ever since you were a                   little girl no matter what the price                   your family or anyone else had to pay!                             DIANE                  You?re not being fair.  I want                   something to love and take care of...                   especially with all the late hours                   you?ve been putting in at work the                   past few years.                             JACK                  Diane, I?ve tried my best to make you                   happy, but it?s never enough for you.                    I?ve given you a house, a car,                   clothes, money, anything you wanted,                    but most of all I gave you my love.                    All I ever asked of you was one little                   thing.  Why can?t you keep that                   promise?         INT.  FORTUNE TELLER PARLOR - NIGHT         GYPSY, a compassionate, middleaged woman lays Tarot cards         out on small table for DIANE who is smoking.  When the         GYPSY is done she looks at DIANE?s cigarette and clears         her throat.  DIANE puts out cigarette.                             DIANE                  I want to know about my marriage.                             GYPSY                  Yes, I can see that.  The Queen of                   Swords is the card of marriage and                   needs a relationship, but you are are                   covered by the Lovers which indicates                   the marriage is at a crossroads.                    Happy times are behind you.  The Ten                   of Swords indicates that you have                   lessons in humility to learn in the                   future.                    You must learn to temper your ego                   needs and quit being a slave to                   material desires as represented by the                   Devil.  Somehow, the Wheel Of Fortune                   reversed tells me there is a karmic                   debt to be paid... possibly in a                   previous existence.                             DIANE                  What does that mean?                             GYPSY                  Karma means what you put out comes                   back to you.  That is cosmic justice.                    Furthermore,  the Empress reversed                   speaks of a creative project aborted                   and child not born.  Are you                   expecting?                             DIANE                  Yes.                             GYPSY                  Let?s see what the final outcome shall                   be.  Hmmmm... Death.                             DIANE                  Does that mean my baby is going to                   die?                             GYPSY                  No, it is not a card of death in a                   physical sense, but a transformation                   or a metamorphosis of some kind... a                   continuation of the circle of life.                             DIANE                  But what about my baby?                             GYPSY                      (closes her eyes)                  I?m sorry, my child, but I don?t see a                   baby in your future.                             DIANE                  This is crap!                             GYPSY                  No.  The cards never lie.  They just                   didn?t tell you the truth you wanted                   to hear.         INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING         DIANE is holding the hand of JENNY, a young woman in bed.                             DIANE                  How do you feel?                             JENNY                  I don?t hurt anymore.  I feel peaceful                   and...  Mama came to me, Diane.                             DIANE                  Jenny, the doctors say you?re going to                   get better.  You just need rest is                   all.                             JENNY                  Diane, you know that?s not true.  It?s                   okay.  Mama?s here.  I?ll be with her                   and Daddy soon.                             DIANE                  Jenny, don?t talk like that.  You?re                   scaring me.  You?re all the family I                   have left and I?m not going to let you                   go.                             JENNY                  It?s not about what you want, Diane.                    Besides Jack will take care of you                   now.  He loves you very much and you                   love him.  Don?t you?                             DIANE                  Of course I do.                             JENNY                  I didn?t think you would ever get over                   Matt.  He always seemed to hurt you so                   bad, but that only seemed to make you                   want him more.                             DIANE                  Yeah, well he?s ancient history.                             JENNY                  Remember the lake we used to spend our                   summers at when we were kids?                             DIANE                  Yes.  Yes, I do.                             JENNY                  I want you to have me cremated and                   spread my ashes on that lake.                             DIANE                  Oh, Jen... I can?t.                             JENNY                  Please, Diane.  Some of my happiest                   memories were spent there with you and                   Mama and Daddy.                             DIANE                  I can?t let them do that to you, Jen.                             JENNY                  Why not?  My body will just be a shell                   and my spirit will be in Heaven                   anyway.                             DIANE                  I wish I had your faith.  I wish... I                   wish I could believe as easily as you                   do.                             JENNY                  We all come here to learn different                   lessons.  Promise me, Diane. Promise                   me that you?ll spread my ashes on the                   lake so you can always go back there                   when you miss me.                             DIANE                  I promise.                             JENNY                  Good.  I love you.                             DIANE                  I love you too.         Diane brings Jenny?s hand to her lips as she closes her         eyes.         INT.  APARTMENT - CHRISTMAS EVE NIGHT         JACK and DIANE sit next to fireplace.  DIANE looks at         JACK.                             DIANE                  Thank you.  You?ve made this the best                   Christmas ever.  I didn?t  think it                   could be after Jenny.                             JACK                  I?ll take care of you now.  Hey, I                   think you have another present.         JACK pulls out a small box hidden under the tree.  DIANE         opens it and finds a ring.  JACK raises his eyebrows as         if to say, ?Will you??  DIANE throws her arms around him         and kisses him.  He continues to hold her as she gazes at         the lights of the tree.                             DIANE                  Jenny looked beautiful at the funeral.                    Could we go to the cemetary tomorrow                   and put some poinsettas on her grave?                             JACK                  Sure.                             DIANE                  I hope she?s comfortable in that                   casket.                             JACK                  I?m sure she is.  So tell me, who do                   you love?                             DIANE                  You and only you.                                                          DISOLVE TO:         INT  RUNDOWN BEDROOM - AFTERNOON         Man on top of DIANE orgasms and rolls over.  MATT is         attractive in a ?bad boy? way.  He lights a cigarette,         inhales and then hands it to DIANE.                             MATT                  You?re a strange chick, Diane.  I                   never knew a girl who liked it as                   rough as you.  You can?t get enough of                   me, can you?                             DIANE                      (Sitting up)                  Not really.  I just like to slum it                   every once in a while.         MATT grabs DIANE and forces her down on bed.  He gets in         her face.                             MATT                  I can have any bitch I want in this                   town... and most of the men too.                    Don?t you forget that.                             DIANE                  Don?t hit me in the face!  Of all                   days, don?t touch my face today.                             MATT                  Does your little white bread boy make                   you feel the way I do when he squeezes                   inside of you with his two inch dick?                    Do you talk dirty for him and scream                   how you want him to fuck you at the                   top of your lungs?!                             DIANE                  You disgust me.                             MATT                  You think you?re too good for anybody,                   don?t ya?  Yet somehow you always come                   sniffin? around here for me to give it                   to you doggie style.  Why is that,                   Diane?                             DIANE                  Only so I don?t have to look at you.                    What time is it anyway?         DIANE gets out of bed and picks up clock on bedside         table.                             DIANE                  Shit!  The rehearsal is in thirty                   minutes.         MATT moves up behind her as she is getting dressed and         thrusts his pelvis into her.                             MATT                  Here COMES the bride!         DIANE turns around and slaps him while Matt falls on bed         laughing.                             DIANE                  You make me sick!                             MATT                  So when will I see you again, baby?                             DIANE                  You won?t.                             MATT                      (exhaling smoke)                  You?ll be back.         INT.  LOBBY - AFTERNOON         Elevator opens and DIANE exits.  She stops in center of         Lobby and turns to look back in the direction of her         husband?s office.         INT.  OFFICE -  A FEW MINUTES EARLIER         JACK sighs and runs his fingers through his hair.                             JACK                  Diane, you just don?t decide to have a                   baby on a whim.  Look, maybe we could                   look into adoption.                             DIANE                  I don?t want to adopt!  I want my own                   baby.  I want our own baby.                             JACK                  You know it runs in my family, Diane.                    You know I had to watch my own brother                   die that way as a child.  I still have                   nightmares about it for God?s sake!  I                   couldn?t live with myself if I had to                   watch my own son or daughter die the                   same way.                             DIANE                  The doctors say there is a fifty/fifty                   chance the baby will be born healthy.                             JACK                  That?s not a chance I?m willing to                   take.                             DIANE                  Well, you?re gonna have to because I?m                   pregnant.         A CLOSE SHOT of JACK as he stares at his wife.                             DIANE                  I love you, Jack..... Do you still                   love me?                             JACK                  I don?t know anymore.         DIANE runs out of office.         INT.  LOBBY - AFTERNOON         DIANE looks down at her stomach and places her hand         there.  Her gaze then turns to the cigarette still         burning in her hand.  She drops the cigarette onto the         ground and rubs it out with her foot.  DIANE turns around         and gets back in elevator going up.         INT.  ELEVATOR         As the door is shutting, a GRUNGY MAN, played by same         actor playing JACK, gets on.  The doors close.  DIANE         smiles at him, but the GRUNGY MAN looks back at her         menancingly.  They ride up in silence as the tension         builds.  The elevator stops again and a well groomed         BUSINESS MAN, played by the actor playing MATT, gets on.          DIANE smiles at him and he returns her smile warmly.  The         doors close and the elevator ascends once more and then         stops to let the GRUNGY MAN off.  As the doors close,         DIANE turns to speak to BUSINESS MAN.                             DIANE                  God, I?m so glad you got on.  That guy                   gave me the creeps.         The BUSINESS MAN smiles at her again.  She smiles back         when suddenly the BUSINESS MAN pulls a piece of wire from         behind his back and wraps it around DIANE?s neck.  They         stare into one another?s eyes as he strangles her.                             GYPSY VOICE OVER                  You must learn to temper your ego                   needs                             JACK VOICE OVER                  You only think of yourself!

MATT VOICE OVER                  You think you?re too good for anybody,                   dont ya?                             JACK VOICE OVER                  You only think of yourself!                                                          DISOLVE TO:         EXT.  ALTAR - CENTURIES AGO         BUSINESS MAN, now a SLAVE wearing only a loin cloth is         tied to an altar at the top of a mountain.  He has dark         skin and hair.  A MASKED PRIEST in long robes approaches         the altar through a mist.  The SLAVE pulls at the         restraints to no avail as he cries for mercy in a strange         tongue.  The MASKED PRIEST raises a dagger above the man         and then plunges the knife into the SLAVE?s chest.  Blood         splatters onto the mask.  The MASKED PRIEST takes off the         mask to reveal DIANE?s face, also with dark skin and         hair.  She reaches into the man?s chest and pulls out his         heart which is still beating.  DIANE holds it up above         her head.  We hear the roar of approval from the crowd         down below.                                                          DISOLVE TO:         INT.  ELEVATOR         DIANE finally takes her last breath.  The BUSINESS MAN         loosens the wire around her neck and DIANE?s body falls         to the ground.  The elevator stops and the BUSINESS MAN         gets off.  DIANE?s eyes stare blankly at the ceiling as         the elevator doors close and the Wheel Of Fortune from         the Tarot deck falls on top of her body.                             GYPSY VOICE OVER                  Karma means what you put out comes                   back to you.  That is cosmic justice.

       MONDAY, MONDAY   The weekend went by so quickly, like the Batman ride at Six Flags Over Georgia.  I didn't work on the screenplay at all this weekend, which throws my schedule off, but I may be able to make up for it over the next few days.  That is life and one must learn to adapt and be flexible.  Call me Gumby!  Yesterday was church, a birthday lunch for Jeff's niece, helping Jeff take down part of Elaine's fence, walking four and a half miles, late dinner, grocery store and then a catch-up conversation with Joan from  Convsersations With A Woman .    There was a nice breeze yesterday, but it still seemed to be rather muggy.  Growing up in Texas, the weather began to be downright hot and humid by the last few weeks of May.  It's been relatively mild here, which Jeff says is normal.  After the mega-carb birthday lunch, I found myself feeling extremely sleepy.  My body is just not used to all the refined sugar in hamburger buns, hot dog buns, potato chips, potato salad, chocolate pie and banana pie.  Now, I'm not saying that no one should eat any carbs, but for me, I tend to stick to fruits, vegetables, whole wheat pasta and whole grain bread.  I find I have more energy, feel better and I don't take on extra body fat.  I didn't feel like running yesterday, so I decided I would do some power walking.  I grabbed my portable jukebox and walked down to the track at the high school.  It was nice to see several African-American people with a few extra pounds working the track.  I always find the people exercising without perfect bodies because it's much harder to be motivated without already having some significant results.  If you already have a six-pack, it's easier to stay on track.  I forgot what good exercise walking is.  Granted, I was walking fast and swinging my arms for momentum, but I wasn't doing the little duck dance that many power walkers do.  I was surprised at how quickly I broke a sweat.  My only complaint about walking is that it takes longer than running.  When I finished, I felt good, but somehow I rubbed a raw spot on the inside of my left leg.  The only thing I can think that was rubbing against it were my shorts and they were fleece so I'm not sure what this is all about.  All I know is that it is painful.  I've started drinking my protein shakes for breakfast again.  I don't care for breakfast.  Every once in a while, I have a craving for waffles or french toast, but I've never beena  big fan of breakfast foods. I'm usually in a hurry anyway. The shake is not bad and fills me up, but sometimes when you drink a lot of protein shakes, you miss chewing.  I realized last night that I have been here in Atlanta eight years now.  I was living in Marietta at this time.  I had stayed with Jeff for two weeks when I first moved here.  We were just friends then.  It was exciting as I got to know the city.  I did a little temp work until my job came in.  Looking back, I really made the move by seat of my pants and I'm amazed that everything came together, but I had confidence that I would.  I had visualized the move in my mind for several months prior to my move and it all came together just as I saw it.  It wasn't until a year later that Jeff and I finally came together, but we needed time to get to know one another.  I think that's one thing about gay dating habits that creates a hurdle in the beginning - our tendency to meet someone and go straight to bed.  Granted, there are exceptions to every rule, and we usually think we are the exception, but I find that the most successful relationships I have had were with guys that I waited a while before I had sex with them.  Instead, I spent time with them and got to know them.  If I found that I liked them as people and friends, then we would become more physically intimate.  It's the times that we took the express bus to the missionary position where I found myself wanting out of the relationship before the end of the week.  They were always small little irreconcilable differences such as: the way he held a cigarette; how he really dressed outside of clubland; extreme neediness; crazy ex-boyfriend who didn't realize his crazy ex-boyfriend status; etc.  The great thing about Jeff is that we already knew each other's personalities and foibles well before we jumped into relationship infested waters.  It wasn't as easy just to dispose of someone once we found ourself repulsed by some personal habit and God only knows what that habit reflected back at what was inside of us that we chose not to see.  Last night, Jeff was driving us home in the Miata.  I turned to look at him and the wind was blowing through his hair.  He looked so handsome.  He turned to look at me and smiled, which made his eyes twinkle.  I said to him, "You're cute.  You can stay."

       HARRY POTTER   Jefffifer went and saw the new Harry Potter movie tonight.  I had read in several different places that it was the best Harry Potter movie yet.  You could definitely see the difference in the directors' styles with the visual presentation in this one.  The bits with the whomping tree were great and I loved Dawn French as the lady in the painting. However, all in all, I don't agree that this was the best Harry Potter movie of all three.  I liked it a lot, but I didn't feel that it was the best.  For one thing, this movie seemed to be on a red alert level throughout the whole movie.  It seemed to plateau instead of having many peaks and valleys.  I know this book's much longer than the first two and it not everything could be crammed in, but the slower parts of movies are like white space in graphic design.  It allows you to rest your eyes and emotions.  I also felt that Malfoy was more of a buffoon in this movie than any serious threat and we saw so little screen time from Hagrid and Professor McDongel.  The new Dumbledore did a nice job.  Emma Thompson did a great job as the divination teacher.  Jeff and I both noticed that when Harry discovers who saved his life at the end of the movie, he was just sort of matter of fact about something that had just been so important to him.  I feel like there was something inbetween that was cut out.  Granted, the movie is already at two hours and 19 minutes.  The closing credits are spectacular.  I imagine the remaning movies are going to be even more difficult to lens simply because each book gets longer and longer and the complexity of the subplots grows.  This book was originally going to be two movies.  Perhaps they will have to resort to that for the upcoming books.  It seems to have worked for  Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 .

       ACT 1   I completed ACT I of the screenplay.  It's actually coming along nicely, but it's tiring to write more than ten or more pages in one sitting.  However, I think I write pretty quickly compared to most people I have talked to.    Tomorrow I'll try to do 15 pages with a break in the middle.  I'll do the same on Sunday.  That means I would be halfway through the screenplay by Sunday evening.  The characters are developing well.  It's always interesting to see what comes out of their mouths.  They aren't exactly following my written treatment faithfully, but the new directions seem to make more sense.  I'm going to trust them.    I've looked back and read over a couple of pages, but I try not to do this.  Instinctively, I begin judging what I wrote and the point is to finish the script, take a day off to decompress and then read the whole script and make revisions.  My concern is that some of the beautiful passages of dialouge I have written may need to be trimmed somewhat.  A screenplay is about action and some scenes may be too long.  I guess that's why we do rewrites.  I'm really enjoying myself and it's been a long time since I have felt this way about anything I was doing.  It feels good.  They are playing  Your Woman  by Whitetown on 88.5. I love that song.  It's too bad the whole album wasn't as good as that one song.

       CANADIAN CLARIFICATION ON LESBIAN SEX   I received an e-mail from Merideth today.  She's been to the blog and surived reading about herself and her husband, Joel.  She did add that what she was trying to say the night we discussed lesbian sex is that most straight men imagine themselves in the middle of two straight women getting it on together.  In other words, what some people might call lipstick lesbians.  Glamerous nude women in heels, thongs, lots of hair, nail polish and tongues of steel.  However, many straight men are shocked to find out that most gay women fall into happy medium between folky girl singer and MABEL (Macho Butch Lesbian).  It doesn't quite have the same effect, does it?  She went on to say that she wasn't sure if most heterosexual men would balk at the opportunity to have a go with two women, but she doesn't think Joel would.  Although she did add that he could surprise her, but after meeting Joel and watching them together, I don't think he would.  I would still wager that most straight married men would shy away from the oppurtinity if presented with it.  Some fantasies are better in mind than in reality.

       PITCH 3.0   After her father is killed in the line of duty, a precocious eight-year-old girl falls in love with her middle-aged gay neighbor.  When her neighbor attracts the attention of a new boyfriend, and she is unable to drive the boyfriend away by any other means, she decides she must kill him through various botched murder schemes involving Easy Bake Ovens, falling bowling balls, doll parts and Vaseline-covered skateboards.    At the same time, her mother's attempts to find a new father for the little girl are thwarted when the mother unexpectedly walks into every hare-brained trap.  This creates more conflict between parent and child as the mother struggles to understand the little girl's odd behavior.  By the end of the story, the little girl befriends the new boyfriend and learns that she cannot control other people or situations out of fear, but instead begins to embraces life with excitement and a sense of adventure.

       IS IT THE SAME KIND OF LOVE?   This morning, I woke up to NPR.  Well, I always do.  2F's sets his clock/radio alarm to switch Public Radio on instead of an annoying bleating sound like a Bo-Pimped sheep.  It doesn't usually wake me up immediately.  Instead, I flail around in bed awhile dreaming of the gas crisis, the war in Iraq and typically someone's murder.  It's very unsettling and as much as I like Bob Edwards, he just doesn't perk me up in the morning.  So I got up and made the bed and out of the blue started singing "River Deep, Moutain High."  It's an old Tina Turner song she recorded with Phil Spector and Erasure covered it in '88.  Well, I started thinking about the lyrics.  Tina sings about how she had a rag doll and loved it like nobody's business and now she loves her beloved like she loved that rag doll.  I thought to myself, "I'm not sure that I want to be loved like a rag doll," as I carefully lined up the lines on the quilt the way 2F's has patiently instructed me to do.  One of the other lyrics goes on about how her boyfriend probably had a puppy and he probably loves her like he loved that puppy.  Now, this could imply beastiality if her intended grew up on a farm or just that he would like to get her on all-fours.  I don't know.  It still doesn't sound very healthy and just sets up an analogy to refer to her as "his bitch."    I personally don't think that fondness for a ragdoll or puppy is the same as the love one feels for boyfriend/girlfriend/lover/partner/wife/husband.  Granted, I think that the love a child has for a stuffed animal will generate a loving energy with the child's body and that's the feeling that they think of when they speak of love.  I do believe that pets are very much a part of our families, but I do not love Buddy in the same way that I love Jeff.  So what's the difference?  Is it the sexual component?  Probably to some degree, but passion fades in time and a deeper love runs through it. I don't mean to imply that I'm a victim of lesbian death bed in reverse, but in time, the friendship and companionship in a relationship takes priority over sex.  It doesn't mean that couples should not have passionate moments, but you don't find yourself looking at him in the middle of the Wal-Mart sporting goods department and saying, "Take me!  I'm passion's plaything."  In the end, I guess true love is the unconditional love we should show both ourselves and others.  Jesus had that right.  Regardless of how you feel about Christianity as a religion, the man had it goin' on.  He saw the child of God in every one and loved them equally.  Jesus didn't say, "I love you all, but I especially love the good Samaritan with the big breasts by the well." He did not love them to get anything in return.  He loved them because they were his brothers and sisters.  I really need to work on that.  I sometimes think we need to create new word for the different types of love.  I know all about agape, but I think we need to define it even further.  There is the love children have for toys.  There is a love for family. There is a love for friends. There is a love for pets.  There is a love for Bananarama.  There is a love for our first girlfriends/boyfriends, which is usually ruled more by hormones and psychological issues than anything else.  There is love for our significant other/wife/husband.  There is a love for mankind.  What are your thoughts about this topic?

       VASELINE INTENSIVE CARE MONKEY BUSINESS   I have very dry hands.  That's all there is to it.  If I don't keep my hands moisturized, they crack and bleed.  It's very painful.  I don't like pain. I guess I'm just funny that way.  As a kid, my mother would slather Neutrogena hand creme on my hands to keep them from cracking and bleeding. "If it works for Norwegian fisherman, surely it will work for you."    Through out my adult life I have always had hand lotion near by both at work and home.  In fact, I even keep a trial size tubes in my backpack and the car.  I never know when I'll need it so I like to be prepared.  Once a Boy Scout, always a Boy Scout I always say.  One advantage of el mano moisturization is that I always have very soft hands.  Women love to touch my hands.  My friend Susan used to touch them for hours the way some women twist their hair around their fingers.  It's too bad I'm not straight because it could definitely work in my favor.  Now, being that use moisturizer for my hands very frequently, I find it smart to buy the big economy size pump of  Vaseline Intensive Care Water Resistant Skin Protectant Lotion  in my bathroom.  It's sort of like how some gay men keep a two-gallon pump of personal lubricant by their bed for when they are flying solo or with a full cabin.  However, I do not personally use my precious  Vaseline Intensive Care Water Resistant Skin Protectant Lotion   as a personal lubricant.  I'm not sure that I want my genitals to be water resistant.  Anyway, I've noticed that some point during a new bottle, it gets edgey and their is nothing worse than edgey hand lotion.  Typically, I place my right hand undter the nozzle and push down with my thumb, which produces a proper, reasonable bit of lotion to put on my hands. By the way, it's best to open the door first or you may find yourself trying to get a grip on the door knob until the lotion soaks in your hands.  I have moments where I have stood at the bathroom door fondling the door knob to no avail.  Beginning yesterday, the pump began shooting hand lotion up in the air and several feet away, missing my hand all together.  It's like going to bed with a sailor who has been at sea for several months.  CHA-CHING!  So there I am, left standing with a palm facing up, dry and empty while lotion criss-crosses the bathroom like disorganized crime tape.  This morning,I adjusted my hand accordingly to account for my sharp-shooting Vaseline.  Once again, there was an orgy of hand lotion over the bathroom.  I feel like I'm up to bat in the World Series and unsure of how the pitcher is going to throw the ball.  I'm not sure there is a solution to my problem, but I just wanted to share.

       TONIGHT, I MET TOXIC PUSSY   Tonight I went to the Image Film & Video Center for a seminar on pitching my screenplay.  I left early and got there five minutes late.  Damn the traffic!  It was an interesting mix of people.  There were four men and the rest were women and we had nice racial mix too.  Everyone was very down to earth, except for maybe one guy and it may have just been general male heterosexualtiness more than cockiness that made him seem so aloof.  I have to say that I really enjoyed finding out the details of the other screenplays. Everyone's idea sounded very marketable.  Oddly enough, one of the other men wrote a story about an eight-year-old girl whose mother died.  Is that eerie or what?  My screenplay is about an eight-year-old girl whose father died.  However, his script is a supernatural thriller and mine is a black comedy.  I also met the lady who wrote Toxic Pussy.  I thought she would be some anime-obsessed chick with tatoos and body piercings.  She could be just your average 40ish woman from the suburbs.  She described her story as a raunchy comedy about a cat that escapes from a lab and passes gas, which kills people.  Somehow it is befriened by a woman with enormous breasts and they are pursued by a detective.  He must stop the toxic pussy before it has kittens.  I have to say it was the most original story I heard tonight and I love the title.  However, it's a hard one to pitch.  Eddie presented the seminar.  He teaches screenwriting at Emory.  He wore a fedora and had a cain.  I'm not sure if he needed it or if he was just being stylish with ambulatory accessories.  Eddie gave good information and we had to pitch each of our scripts to him.  I did a pretty good job the first time around because he didn't rip me up too bad.  He had us work on them a few minutes and then we did it again and he liked it even better the second.  He said my delivery was a bit morose, but I was just trying to project loude enough in the room where sound didn't carry well.  I'll be zany on the day of when I have a mic.  Eddie seemed to like my story too.  He used it as an example many times during the course of the evening.  More importantly, I like my story.  I worked on it a bit this afternoon before the meeting and things are flowing much better now.  Every day some new little detail is tweaked.    On the day of the event, we have about 50-seconds to pitch our story to the panel of industry professionals and then they or members of the audience can ask questions.  Surprisingly, this is a popular event to watch and the 250 seats should sell out.  The great thing about this contest is that all the participants are having our work presented to industry professionals and even the scripts that are not chosen can still end up being produced.  In fact, the screenplay that was entered is just sort of like a business card that is opening up opportunities.  It may result in meeting someone who will ask a contestant to write a screenplay from an idea they have.  The funny thing is that the contest isn't based upon how good your writing is.  It's about how good your idea is and how good you can sell it to producers as something they need.  It's funny how this is drawing upon the skills I have developed over the past year.  The three finalists will be announced at the Atlanta Film Festival at 6:30pm after the contest.  In the past, I would be very tense and thinking negatively, but I feel very good about this.  In my mind, I'm already a winner because I have gotten turned on to screenwriting again and see how real the possibilities are.  It's not so far away and impossible anymore.  Plus, I really believe in this story.    Eddie told us to keep working on our pitches and e-mail them to him so he can review them and help us tighten them up.  I may have to take his class now.

       BARRY MUST DIE   I was worried last night about not waking up in time for my PowerCore meeting and then I woke up half an hour before the alarm went off and could't go back to sleep.    It was a rather quiet meeting.  I nailed my InfoMinute right at sixty seconds and received some ooh's and ahh's.    I went by the office and dropped off the settlement statements from last Thursday's closing.  The attorney still has not received the Certificate of Occupancy (CO) and if he doesn't receive it by Friday, the lender will not fund the loan.  This deal will close or there will be a reatlor, customer and mortgage broker after a builder.  I went to the PowerCore New Member Orientation.  I was not in the mood to network or be sociable today.  The information was helpful, but I didn't care for having it at a restaurant during lunch.  I don't like trying to eat and listen and participate at the same time.  As soon as the meeting was over, I headed to the restroom.  I cannot hold water for longer than 30 seconds, but soft drinks can stay in my bladder for days.  Go figure!  Anyway, as I looked down into the urinal, I noticed that someone had written on the little plastic pad "BARRY MUST DIE!"  I contemplated it as I urinated and it left me with all sorts of questions.  Who is Barry?  What did he do?  Why must he die?  Who wants to harm him?  Does he like Bananarama too?  It was all too much.  Finally, I had to walk away from it all or go mad.  Bonnie gave me two realtor leads and I followed up on them.  I got voice mail and have not heard anything back.  I've developed a pretty thick skin about realtors.  It's a numbers thing.  Eventually, I'll land a couple more. I think the Perfect Pitch Contest has given me some new confidence in the other areas of my life.  It's like a gentle reminder that I do in fact have value.  We sometimes forget things like that.   I haven't received any calls from the ad in SoVo yet, but typically it has to run a few weeks and people need to see it a few times before they call.  Advertising and marketing is interesting.

       THINKING OF OTHERS   My advice for Elaine turned out to be disasterous.  Now she has to find a new place to live and be out of her current house in six days.  If anyone knows of anyone in Atlanta looking for a roommate, please e-mail me.  Also, my friend, Cherry, e-mailed me and she is returning home to Burleson.  Her father is battling colon cancer and she is going to spend some time there to help her mom out.  Gosh, it seems like only yesterday I was giving Cherry rides home from school and we were listening to Tears For Fears.  She only lived one street over from mine.  She is one of those rare women that can be your buddy and sex kitten all at the same time.  If only my sexuality had not gotten in the way.  Now she is an opera singer in NYC and teaches computer skills to the spouses of celebrities.    Please think a kind thought for Elaine and Cherry's father.

       NAOMI, MAKE IT STOP!   I'm having another reoccuring dream again lately.  It's always the same.  I'm doing crunches at the gym and suddenly Ashely Judd appears in Versace.  She walks around the mat and speaks in a big words that even I don't know and would have to look up in the dictionary.  I feel like she is trying to warn me or tell me something.  Finally, she becomes frustrated and goes over to the butterfly press and works out her frustrations.  Tentatively, I approach her and put my hand on her shoulder.  She turns around, only now it's Elton John in Versace and his hair extensions are askew.  It startles me and I wake up.  What does it all mean?

       THE JOY OF GAY JFK   Yesterday was a quiet day.  I woke up early and sprang, literally, out of bed.    I did things around the house in the morning and ran some errands shortly before lunch.  I finally bought a 12-pack of Sharpie markers at Michael's.  I don't know whey I wanted them so badly other than the fact that they come in a rainbow of colors.  I have been obsessed with color, especially orange, since art school.  Plus, I had a 50% off coupon for Sunday and Monday only.  I went to Borders to see if they had the new David Sedaris book so I could use my gift card from last September, but learned that it came out today.  I briefly flirted with buying  Swimming To Antarctica , but talked myself out of it.  I already have two more books to read before I do that.  Besides, I don't need any distractions until after the Perfect Pitch Contest.  Instead, I purchased a book on some database things I want to do with Dreamweaver MX.  I'm helping Jeff with the Web portion of his book store and Jim with the Web site for his gourd artwork.  Web stuff is actually fun again for once after the long two years of school.  When I got home, I discovered the CD with all the files used in the book were missing.  I called the Midtown store and they said they had three in stock.  I figured that I'd go up there later that evening and exchange it.  I received a lead from my Georgian Merideth yesterday.  I believe I can offer a better rate and loan program than what he was offered, but I need to check on a few things this morning.  I've started setting some simple and modest sales goals.  For this month, I'm aiming to take one or more loan applications a week.  Interestingly enough, I have in the two weeks that I've set and written down that goal.  The mind is an amazing thing.  I spent the afternoon doing the unfun portions of screenplay writing, which is planning and character development.  It's a slow process that makes one think.  Syd Field refers to it as the "Kick Your Ass" process and and I have to concur with his opinion.  Oddly enough, I still didn't feel discouragement slip a mickey into my mental attitude martini.    Elaine came by this evening and we discussed some options for her housing situation and I gave her some feedback on which option I thought was best for her.  It seemed to help her.  We also discussed the parts of her manuscript I read.  She has lead a very interesting life.  The story is about some experiences that are specific to women.  I gave Elaine some feedback that I felt came from a storytelling aspect, but it's a tricky dance when you are discussing a story where you cannot completely understand the character's situation because of gender.  Elaine seemed to think my comments were helpful, but the decision to make use of those comments is up to her.  It will be interesting to see how the story develops.  Afterwards, I drove up to Borders to exchange the book.  A very cynical woman helped me when I couldn't find a replacement on the shelf.  She asked me why I didn't ask them to hold one and I told her the woman said there wre three in stock and there should be plenty when I got here.  She told me that I must have called some place else because no one would have told her that.  I told her very nicely that unless there is another store answering the Phone Borders Midtown, I had indeed called the write store and spoke with Barbara and that is what she told me.  If there was a problem with the information that was relayed to me, perhaps she should discuss it with Barbara.  The woman's eyes turned to little slits and she walked off to check in the back.  As I stood there waiting for her, I noticed an endcap of gay-related books in the computer section.  I wondered why they didn't put them on the endcap of the gay and lesbian studies section. Did they uncover solid evidence that hot gay men are in fact attracted to computer geeks?  Is there research that gay men will eagerly pick a copy of the  HTML Bible  for the coffee table when it's next to an endcap full of mysteries solved by circuit boy detectives?  More importantly, why would anyone write a book called  The Joy Of Gay JFK ?  I took a closer look and realized that JFK was actually Sex.  It was in a funny font and the word Sex was in a different color.  I looking forward to see what pictures were inside  The Joy Of GAY JFK .  The cynical woman returned and gave me a copy of the book.  I noticed her attitude had improved.  Maybe she had banged her head against the wall in back of took a cat o' nine tails to Barbara in the stock room.  As I was waiting for Jeff to get ready for bed, I checked some of the blogs I normally read.  I was tired physically and mentally and actually found a ring of gay Atlanta blogs.  They were interesting and I think one guy may live up the street from me.  Small world!  It also brought to my attention that I'm not a normal gay man.  I do not ingest enough mind-altering substances or drink enough refreshing, adult beverages to fill a small kiddie pool.  Nor do I post enough intriguing images of myself on my blog in various states of undress, pursing my lips at the camera to evoke a myriad of vacant and desirable looks.  In short, other than the fact that I'm in a relationship with an other man and have a fabulous CD collection, I'm not very gay at all.  However, I still enjoyed them anyway.  In fact, I may read them again some time in the future.  Well, I have a lot of e-mail that I have not answered and I need to look at a few other things for other people.  I should be able to take care of my work priorities for today by early afternoon so I should have the rest of the day to take care of other things.  The writers' group meets tonight and I'm debating if I should go.  I have so much to do, but I get so much out of just meeting with my friends from the group each time.  I did write a story already, but it's just a matter of how much I get done on the screenplay before the meeting.  After the meeting I'll probably go to bed because my PowerCore meeting is tomorrow at 7am, which means I need to wake up at 5:30am.  Tomorrow is a full day out in the field.  Time to get to work.

       GOING TO THE DOGS    I've been feeding and letting my neighbors' dogs out in the evenings.&nbsp; They consist of a little mutt, named Max, a tiny, fluffy toy poodle, Poochie, a sassy, black dachshund, Daisy and a fostered mutt whose name I forget.&nbsp; She's a sweet thing, but old and blind.&nbsp; I usually have to pick her up and take her outside and set her down on the grass.&nbsp; She doesn't like the grass for some reason and finds it best to squat on the deck and propel urine out of her body with great force.&nbsp; Thankfully, her other excretory functions are not spring-loaded as well.&nbsp; However, that would be some trick at the canine Olympics, wouldn't it?   There is a couple who come by in the mornings and they leave me messages on notebook paper.&nbsp; Last night's message read"    Jeff     &nbsp;   Fix dog food    We be back morning    Now, I admire people who can write a short, succinct message, which gets straight to the point, but don't deny me my punctuation.&nbsp; It adds the texture to the written language&nbsp;like the crunch to my food - pure pleasure!&nbsp; From the note,&nbsp;I have somewhat of an idea of what the couple may be like, but I found the beer bottles in the trash more telling.&nbsp; Somehow, I don't think Daisy, Max and Poochie have much interest in Bud Light.   I always find it interesting to go into someone's house while their gone.&nbsp; I'm not sure what turns me on more: the fact they actually trust you; or knowing that you can do anything while their gone and they'll never know.&nbsp; I could go through all their drawers and try on all their clothes.&nbsp; I could have a keg party.&nbsp; I could put on a non-musical production of Rogers & Hammerstein's  South Pacific  in their living room.&nbsp; The sky is the limit.&nbsp; However, as heady as it can be, I never do anything.&nbsp; It's the opportunity that makes my nipples hard, not the actual execution or fulfillment of the possibility.   In closing, I will say that the little foster dog has affected me this week.&nbsp; She has taken a shining to me and follows me around&nbsp;wherever I go while&nbsp;I'm there. Yes, I know she's blind, but I really think she likes me. While the other dogs can be anybody's for a dog treat, the little foster dog ignores them and prefers to remain quietly near me and wags her tail as I pet her.&nbsp; How did we ever become so close to these animals?&nbsp; How did we ever learn to trust one another and how did they learn to give to us so unconditionally?&nbsp; It amazes me.   Well, it's been a busy day today and I have many things to do still.&nbsp; Have a great weekend.

       MIRROR, MIRROR....    I went to  urlLink Billy's  blog this morning and read his post BOO-KITTY!&nbsp; It reminded me again of why I like reading blogs, which is&nbsp;a frequent theme in my posts.   We all have moments where something captures our undivided attention and adds value to our lives.&nbsp; It might be rocking a baby to sleep or hitting that home run that won the game or the first time you realized Madonna existed and should be worshipped.&nbsp; (I'm thinking about the people I know.)&nbsp; Jeff once shared a story with me of how he learned to love baseball.&nbsp; In the summer, his parents put him to bed about 7:30pm when it was still light.&nbsp; He used to hide out under his covers and listen to the baseball game on his transistor radio.   Now, when I read Billy's post, I did not become teary-eyed, but I was touched by his experience.&nbsp; (You'll have to read his post to understand what I'm referring to.)&nbsp; There was something that happened in his past that had value to him.&nbsp; He interpreted it in words and put it out on the Internet for everyone to experience.&nbsp; Then we visit his blog, read it and it changes us.&nbsp; We're influenced by his words, his thoughts and experiences and we'll never be the same again.&nbsp;   Some posts may make us laugh or cry or make us think or make us angry.&nbsp; They're like mirrors that reflect back what's inside of us and/or what would like to see inside ourselves.

       JUSTICE FOR KIRSTY    I came across this article on the  urlLink BBC News  website regarding one of my favorite singers, Kirsty MacColl.&nbsp; In addition to being married to Steve Lillywhite, one of U2's favorite producers, singing backup for various musicians such as Morrissey and the Pogues, daughter of Ewan MacColl who wrote The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, she was also a formniable singer and songwriter herself.&nbsp; Her most memorable songs include  They Don't Know ;  There's A Guy Down At The Chip Shop Who Swears He's Elvis ;  A New England; Terry ;  Walking Down Madison  and T he Fairy Tale Of New York  with the Pogues.&nbsp;   After her divorce from Lillywhite, Kirsty's career began to pick up again when she recorded  Tropical Brainstorm  which included the hit,  In These Shoes? , which was featured on Sex And The City and later covered by Bette Midler.&nbsp; In my humble opinion, Kirsty's was the better version.&nbsp; It's ironic and less "over the top," which allows the humor to shine through.&nbsp; Who else would write a song about an on-line sexual encounter with a man from Amsterdam and write a chorus that goes, "Sha-la-la-la-la get your rocks off baby"?   In December 2000, Kirsty was diving off the coast of Cozumel with her two sons when she was hit by&nbsp;a speedboat in an area reserved for swimmers.&nbsp; Her sons witnessed her death.&nbsp; Click  urlLink here  for the original BBC News article.   Deckhand Juan Jose Cem Yam was found guilty of culpable homicide in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cem Yam was fined 61 by a Mexican court after being found guilty of negligent homicide in March last year.&nbsp; He was also ordered to pay 1,450 in damages to MacColl's two sons, Jamie and Louis.&nbsp; Private investigators hired by Kirsty's mother, Jean, say they have new evidence about who was driving the boat when Kirsty was hit and the case has been reopened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean has created&nbsp; urlLink Justice For Kirsty &nbsp;where you can keep track of the most recent efforts to seen justice done and donate to the cause.   All in all, it sounds like there is something fishy about this case and I'm glad it's being reopened.&nbsp; I was absolutely gutted when I heard that she had died.&nbsp; It was truly a great loss.&nbsp; The situation can best be summed up by quoting a line from Kirsty's hit,  There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis , "But he's a liar and I'm not sure about you."

       A SMILE TO HIS FACE    I told Jeff about the poem that I wrote for him seven years ago and posted on the blog.&nbsp; He doesn't read my blog.&nbsp; He doesn't understand why I want to share the personal details of my life with strangers all over the world.&nbsp; He's kind of private.   I showed him the post and the nice comments so many of you took the time to share.&nbsp; He smiled and thought it was sweet. As he walked away, I think I heard him whistling and had a bounce in his step.

       VOICEOVER CLASS #4    I walked into class just as we were starting this evening.&nbsp; The only chair available was next to Mr. Puppy Dog.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy, but he watches me through out the whole class.&nbsp; He may read  Maxim , but I think it's just for the articles.   There are several African-Americans in my class who have great voices.&nbsp; One has done voiceover work for PBS documentaries in North Carolina, but she has only made half of the classes so far.&nbsp; The two guys both sound good.&nbsp; One wants to go into radio and I think he'll do great.&nbsp; He just likes to read stuff too. He's not interesting in emoting noun articles.&nbsp; The other guy has some background in television or radio, but I don't recognize him.&nbsp; Since I seldom watch TV or listen to the radio, that would make sense. I find it ironic that my bachelor's degree is in radio/TV production.   Suzanne, the word-stretcher, did not bother me as much tonight.&nbsp; I think I may be growing fond of her.&nbsp; Naturally, that scares the hell out of me.&nbsp; You let someone become privy to your trust one day and the next day your reading Dr. Suess to disabled children in the Macon Public Library.&nbsp; I guess that really wouldn't be so bad as long as I don't have to "Stretch Armstrong" the words.   The Spanish girl is growing on me too.&nbsp; She is so dedicated to her craft and never afraid to interpret any piece of text dramatically.&nbsp; Who knew the ingredients in Lipton Onion Soup Mix could be so moving?&nbsp; And her encore of combining the soup mix with ground beef for zesty hamburgers?&nbsp; Fan-bloody-tastic!   Paul Harvey Man still bothers me.&nbsp; I like his regular voice, but whenever he reads anything in class, it always sounds like he is a character actor in a Rodgers & Hammerstein musical after a night out on the town with a bunch of Russian sailors.&nbsp; Imagine Paul Lynde & Wayland Flowers &amp; Madame in  Rent .&nbsp; That's what it's like.&nbsp; Stuart kept trying to make him read in a normal voice and it was very difficult for him.&nbsp; I suppose I can empathize, but I'm afraid it will lead me down the stoney path to become Saint Candyass.   The professional dancer with the bad knees has been warming up to me.&nbsp; Her knowledge of the different places in the body that Americans suck air into is amazing.&nbsp; I think her voice would sound much better if she dropped it down a bit.&nbsp; Her interpretation and phrasing&nbsp;are very good.   I forgot to do my homework this week.&nbsp; We were supposed to look up forty of the most misunderstood and mispronounced words by Yale drama students.&nbsp; Thankfully, I knew most of them already.&nbsp; We went around the room and had to pronounce and define them.&nbsp; Oddly enough, I knew what a quidnunc was and how to pronounce it.&nbsp; Even stranger, the word pronunciation was on the list.   My inner smart ass came out a few times in class today.&nbsp; I think Stuart likes me, even though I didn't do my homework and I still struggle to blend.&nbsp; I really need to practice this week.&nbsp; I'd like the last four weeks to be very good.&nbsp; I'd like to continue studying with Stuart afterwards, but I just have so much going on right now.   I wonder what I could next week to throw Mr. Puppy Dog off.&nbsp; I purposely didn't talk to him much tonight in hopes that he might calm down a bit.&nbsp; He has more enthusiasm than Burt Reynolds has body hair.&nbsp; He was looking onto my legal pad as I was listing Madonna singles in sequential order to stay awake.&nbsp; I thought about drawing pictures of muscular men with erections just to see if his eyes would grow wide and there might be an audible THUMP of his loins hitting the table, but I really don't want to encourage that.&nbsp; I just want him to mess with him a bit.&nbsp; I think I'll create a necrophilia lover's newsletter in Microsoft Word this week and have it casually fall out of my folder for him to see.&nbsp; I definitely did not get enough sleep last night and I'm meeting Jason to swim tomorrow morning.

       THIS IS WHY I AM A MORTGAGE BROKER    I had a wonderful closing this afternoon.&nbsp; My golden couple closed on their new home.&nbsp; I loved working with them.&nbsp; They had the highest credit score I have ever seen and everything about them was wonderful: property; credit; assets; income; employment; etc.&nbsp; They were also very organized and were such a joy to work with.&nbsp; I think I shock clients with my quick response time.&nbsp; It's rare that you will not reach me on my mobile phone, but if you don't, my goal is to return a call within an hour, usually less.&nbsp;&nbsp;   This time of the month is very busy for closing attorneys and they may close 25 or more loans per day.&nbsp; We should have had our settlment statement last night or at the very least early this morning, but we didn't receive it until an hour before the closing.&nbsp; I called my client to tell him how much to bring to the closing.&nbsp; It wasn't my fault, but I hate for things not to go perfectly.   The sellers were the first to arrive and I had a very enjoyable conversation with them.&nbsp; The buyers arrived next followed by the two realtors.&nbsp; George loves to close with Mark and we typically have a good time.&nbsp; George is so funny.&nbsp; He makes our work so much fun.&nbsp; The other realtor, Andrew, told me today that I'm officially his lender and showed me all&nbsp;my business cards in his portfolio.&nbsp; He gave me a lead, which I called on today and the buyers asked if I would like to put one of my signs in their yard.&nbsp;   I feel that I can finally relax a bit.&nbsp; I have been so focused on getting my business to this level and now I can just concentrate on helping my clients and realtors for awhile.&nbsp; I like meeting clients and making everything run as smoothly as possible for them.&nbsp; They have enough to worry about.&nbsp; I love giving good service. (Don't take a beautiful moment to the gutter.) Of course, the money is good too.&nbsp; All in all, to quote  urlLink Daniel , today was magically delicious.

       A VIEW FROM I-75    I had major insomnia last night.&nbsp; Of course, this surprises no one.&nbsp; Most people who know me understand that I think sleep is the biggest waste of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could do so much more with that time.&nbsp;   Last night I pre-qualified the my new lead who works for a major sports organization.&nbsp; Then as I was searching for some blank agreements to sell personal property for a For Sale By Owner (FSBO) that I'm working with, I found a folder full of poetry, short stories and plays I have written over the last 20 years.&nbsp; I decided that I must type a few up and feature them on my blog.&nbsp; I hope you liked them.&nbsp; I need to alot some more time to my personal website with my portfolio of written works.   PowerCore went fine today.&nbsp; I have been asked to be Junior Deputy Referral Coordinator.&nbsp; I thinks that's what Irene said.&nbsp; She's going to Prague for two weeks in August.&nbsp; I'm also a back up in case she gets stuck in traffic, which doesn't make much sense if you consider that we live less than a mile apart and I would probably be stuck in traffic too.&nbsp; There was a couple there today who you can hire to go do your errands.&nbsp; They are called The Gopher Girls.&nbsp; That made me laugh.&nbsp; I have to stop doing that.&nbsp; The last time was during someone's infominute and everyone looked at me as if to ask, "What is it?"&nbsp; You can't respond back with, "I just thought of something my mother said once."&nbsp; It sounds like you're not listening or you hear voices.   On the way home today I noticed that the car in front of me on the highway had an orange cone stuck under its wheel axel.&nbsp; It didn't seem to be causing any problem, but I wondered if the driver was aware of its presence.&nbsp; It made me wonder what I'm not aware of.&nbsp; This made me think of the character in Doctor Zhivago who doesn't realize how beautiful she is and goes through her whole life believing she is plan.&nbsp; What if I go through my whole like and never realized that I'm a total hottie?&nbsp; I never really thought about it because I'm no one special.&nbsp; I've only been asked to do gay porn fifteen or sixteen times.&nbsp; You know, I've never named my penis.&nbsp; Is that weird?&nbsp; If you name your penis, should you name your testicles as well?&nbsp; I wouldn't want to leave anyone out and have anyone get jealous.&nbsp; Of course that begs the question of whether the scrotum is actually an entity of itself or just a place for the testicles to hang around.&nbsp; So, I ask all of my female readers, if you have named your vagina, did you also name your ovaries as well? Inquiring minds want to know.&nbsp; I think the lack of sleep has caught up with me.

       NAKED     I wrote this poem after the first time Jeff and I made love.&nbsp; I was still reeling from the surprise and astonishment of after being friends for two years, we finally came together in a way that seemed so natural, but we had both been resisting.&nbsp; He had never been with a man before and it was both exciting and terrifying for him.&nbsp; Looking back, it was for me too.    naked  you turn away from me  reticent  in your love  you avert your gaze  from the intensity  in my eyes  sexuality  creativity  acceptance  and nourishment for the soul   i can feel the tears run down your heart  as my energy reaches out to heal you   i can hear the cries of your inner child  as he throws himself on the ground  kicking and screaming  with the fury of runaway horses  while crying out to the universe  for a gentle, reassuring touch   i carefully wrap my arms around you  like tissue paper around glass  fragile   i kiss your neck  and feel you inhale my being  relax  and lose yourself in my breathing  as the rising and falling of your chest  becomes in unison with my own  no words  no promises  just the moment  when we can both lay down our arms  newborn  and naked

       MARTA    I wrote this poem to be used as part of an art project that I have never completed.&nbsp; It was to be printed out in a column format as if it was an article torn from a newspaper.&nbsp; It would be centered on a canvas with bits of trash that you would find on the subway and Polaroid pictures of the narrator.    &nbsp;  I wrote it in the  urlLink Caribou Coffee  on the corner of Piedmont and Monroe in Atlanta in the summer of 1996.&nbsp; I had been thinking about lust, the past and Anne Rice, in no particular order.    It's almost midnight and I am riding the

       ODE TO A DEAD SQUIRREL     By request, I have been asked to post my classic poem about road kill:    On my way home from work today  I passed a dead squirrel in the road  He was round and flat like a pancake,  But his tail was still slightly fluffy  His little brown eyes were open  He seemed almost human   I wondered if he had a little squirrel family  Waiting for Daddy to bring nuts home for dinner  With a little squirrel wife suffering from little squirrel post natal depression  Little squirrel children squabbling  Over a little squirrel prize out of a little squirrel box of little squirrel cereal  A little squirrel teenage daughter  Who never comes out of the little squirrel bathroom  Did he worry about&nbsp;squirrel&nbsp;pattern baldness?  Tree&nbsp;payments?  If he got enough bran in his diet?  Was he ever racked with little squirrel guilt over masturbation  In his tender, teenage squirrel years?  What kind of sound does a squirrel make during orgasm?   Did he ever experience that dissatisfaction  While gathering nuts one day?  "Is this it?  Is this all there is?"  Was he really waiting to throw himself  In front of that station wagon  Full of ornery Cub Scouts  On the way home in the car pool?  A squirrel on the edge  Driven to the brink of destruction  Or maybe he was just gay   Alas, I'll never know  About that time a large, Hostess bakery goods truck rolled over the squirrel  I watched the truck drive off into the distance  With the squirrel stuck in the tread of the tire  Disappearing  Reappearing  Disappearing  Reappearing  Going round and round   Somehow it made me think it was the skit that Lucille Ball forgot to perform  Were she and Vivian Vance secret lovers?  I read that once  However, they're both dead now  And we'll never know  Why doesn't anyone think to ask these things before they die?  Then again,  Perhaps I think too much

       EASY AS A, B, C    Last night I went through all the blogs I bookmarked over the past six months and sorted through them.&nbsp; I tried to decide which ones I would really go back and read and which ones I was still interested in.&nbsp; It's nothing&nbsp;personal.&nbsp; There's just not enough time in the day to visit the entire Internet.   After deciding which ones to keep, I put them in all in alphabetical order so I could access them easier.&nbsp; Some update daily, some once a week.&nbsp; I find something interesting on all of them.&nbsp; Some are political and some are whimsical.&nbsp; Most are nothing like my own.&nbsp; I like reading about people who are different from myself.&nbsp; I also try to comment on other blogs.&nbsp; It's nice to receive a comment and I try to spread encouragement and a humorous thought where I can.    You may have noticed that I'm proof reading my posts pretty regularly now and using spell check.&nbsp; If my typing could keep up with my mind, I probably wouldn't have to.

       SAY MY NAME, SAY MY NAME    Someone asked me recently what it's like to date someone with your own name.&nbsp; Well, it's interesting.&nbsp; Obviously, I do spell my name differently from Jeff since I do not believe in a silent "f."&nbsp; (Isn't a silent "e" enough in one alphabet?)&nbsp; Typically, when someone says our names, we usually know who they are referring to.&nbsp; It must have something to do with pheremones.   When&nbsp;I answer the telephone and they ask for one of us by name,&nbsp;it's a little harder.&nbsp; Jeff suggested that I answer the phone with my full name, but I told him I couldn't do that unless I asked if they wanted fries with their order.&nbsp; It just seems too unnatural.&nbsp; So I'm not a team player in this arena - So sue me!&nbsp;   Jeff had told me that I don't actually call him by name very much.&nbsp; This is probably true.&nbsp; If he is sitting in the same room with me, when I speak, it's not hard to figure out who I am addressing.&nbsp; Jeff calls me by name more often.&nbsp; We also have silly names for each other, which we use more often, but I'm not going to share those with you. They're not kinky or anything; I just don't want them to lose their specialness.&nbsp; It's like taking the Lord's name in vain.   People generally want to know what it's like to call out your own name in the throes of passion.&nbsp; Upon reflection, I don't think I yell Jeff's name or anyone else's for that matter, which could be highly embarrassing.&nbsp; Several years ago I just learned just to say, "Oh baby."&nbsp; That way you don't stumble over anyone else's name later on down the line.&nbsp; When someone has your bits in their mouth, you don't want to piss them off.&nbsp; They may grind their teeth when they're angry.

       THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN INSIDE    "I had never been with a black man before," my friend began, "But the thought of him fucking me, of having his cock inside me just really turned me on."   Although I appreciate the fact that most people feel comfortable sharing most everything with me, his comment made me somewhat uncomfortable.&nbsp; "The only difference is the color of his skin." I reminded him.&nbsp; "It's not like sex comes in different flavors depending upon your pigment." Then I started wondering about what it would be like to have sex with&nbsp; a raspberry flavored/colored man.   "No, that's not what I mean.&nbsp; I've never been attracted to black men before, but the thought of having a black man penetrating me, a white man, just really excited me."   I began to feel that incredibly embarrassed feeling I typically get just before Lucy does something really stupid.&nbsp; This was beginning to sound racist in my friend's own innocent way.&nbsp; In his defense, he had grown up somewhat sheltered in a well-to-do, Southern family.&nbsp; "Why does it excite you?"   "Because I know my father would die if he knew I was having sex with a black man, of having him inside me."   "If you only had sex with him because he was black, that sounds like you are using him as an object instead of for who he is as a whole person.&nbsp; If I was him and you told me that, I'd be offended."   "Use him?&nbsp; It was just a fuck.&nbsp; It's not like we're dating or anything."   "That's not the point.&nbsp; You didn't have sex with him because you were attracted to him as a person.&nbsp; You had sex with him because he was black."   "I really didn't put that much thought into it.&nbsp; So you're telling me that you've never had a one night stand with someone just because of some physical trait?&nbsp; Or did you get to know them as a  whole person  first?"   He had a point.&nbsp; "I don't recall anyone ever being discriminated against because of the color of their hair or eyes.&nbsp; I'm saying you boinked the guy because it turned you on that your parents would disapprove of you having sex with a black man.&nbsp; If you had gone out, saw him and went home with him just because you found him attractive or liked his sense of humor, that would be different.&nbsp; I bet you wouldn't even go out with him again."   "I would."   "Really?"   "Sure.&nbsp; He wore&nbsp;Ralph Lauren and drove a BMW and he had a really nice dick."&nbsp; In his own way, this was my friend's way of seeing beyond color.&nbsp; Then he added, "Besides, it's not like he's one of those  thug  black guys who wears all the gold chains and  acts  black."   "I don't think I can discuss this with you anymore."   My friend took a drag on his cigarette and was pensive for the moment.&nbsp; "It's funny you should get so bent out of shape over the fact that I find having a black man fuck me to be exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, it's like I'm doing my own part for the civil rights movement."   I looked him in the eye.&nbsp; "Do you really believe that?"   "Of course.&nbsp; It means I'm not a bigot like my dad.&nbsp; After all, how much more can I give of myself to someone?"   I thought about this for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend was absolutely sincere in what he was&nbsp;saying to me, but it came out like he was telling someone, "Of course I think you're attractive.&nbsp; It's not like your missing a leg or something."&nbsp; However, at the same time I was appalled that his pleasure from&nbsp;being with this person stemmed from what the man represented in his Southern bred psyche instead of for the person that this guy was.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in the South, there is an unspoken taboo that you do not date, marry or fuck someone of another color... especially when the&nbsp;skins contrast each so starkly&nbsp;as black and white do.&nbsp; Somehow, Asian or Hispanic is much more&nbsp;acceptable, but now days you see more and more interracial couples among young people.&nbsp; Attitudes are changing.   In addition, you have the taboo of a man being penetrated.&nbsp; Nothing scares the hell out of a straight man, and some gay ones, more than that.&nbsp; It is all sodomy no matter how much love it is done with.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one thing to know that your son was gay, but for him to be a&nbsp;passive sex partner, that was unthinkable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, combine&nbsp;these two taboos together, and you've got something explosive.   My friend had a good point though.&nbsp; Was there any difference between picking someone up because they were black and picking someone up because they were muscular,&nbsp;hairy or had&nbsp;dark hair.&nbsp; Sure&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;someone's skin crossed over into the&nbsp;ambiguous edge of&nbsp;racial discrimination, but when you really get down to the essence of it, they are all the same.&nbsp; You are attracted to them because of&nbsp;what the &nbsp;black skin, red hair, a muscular body build or a hairy chest or back mean in your psyche.&nbsp; Isn't it just as much discrimination to turn down a lean unmuscular guy only to be with a big muscular one? It's not like your rating both on their personality and values.&nbsp; It's just that this type of discrimination is accepted and not emotionally charged in our society.   My head was beginning to throb. Finally, I decided to ask one last question. "Do you remember his name" I asked.   "Sure," my friend said, looking at me quizzically.&nbsp; "It's Clay."   For some reason, that made me feel better.

       LIFE AND THE BROWN LEATHER CHAIR   It was a little slow this afternoon so I decided to tidy up the house.&nbsp; As I was upstairs cleaning the master bedroom, I noticed that Jeff had cleaned off the brown leather chair he bought last year.&nbsp; I had always wanted a chair like that.&nbsp; You have probably seen them at Pottery Barn&nbsp;or similar stores.&nbsp; I think he actually bought this one at Rich's.&nbsp;   Typically&nbsp;the brown leather chair &nbsp;is filled with clothes or stacks of things.&nbsp;I recently cleared it out while he was in Central America and sat in it one evening, reading a book.&nbsp; It was very nice.&nbsp; It looks very stylish in the corner of the room.&nbsp; You can lean back and put your feet up and watch the moon and stars through the skylight.&nbsp;   When Jeff returned, so did the stuff in the chair.&nbsp; I can't complain.&nbsp; It's his chair and his stuff.&nbsp; However, I noticed this afternoon that the chair was empty.&nbsp; I was surprised that Jeff left a flat surface uncovered and cheered him inside.&nbsp; As I walked around the bed with the vacuum cleaner, I noticed that there was actually a pair of folded pants&nbsp;that was not visible behind the arm of the chair.&nbsp; I sighed.&nbsp; "Life is like that," I thought to myself.&nbsp; "You go along thinking that your chair is empty and you prepare to sit down only to find a pair of pants there.&nbsp; Then again, you may need those pants someday."&nbsp; I smiled and headed down stairs to suck grime out of crevices.&nbsp; Perception is everything.

       SWIMMING TO ANTARCTICA   I have been wanting to read  urlLink this book  for many months now and finally bought it a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I had purchased a book at  Borders  and realized that I was in love with the idea of reading that book, but I never would.&nbsp; Does that make sense?&nbsp; It's sort of like I was in love with the idea of the mesh club shirt from  urlLink International Male , but it felt entirely too creepy when I put it on my bare skin.&nbsp; I'm also slightly disturbed that just about every store sells through  urlLink Amazon  on-line now.&nbsp; However, I digress.  For those of you who don't know, Lynne Cox broke the men's and women's world record for swimming the English Channel when she was 15.&nbsp; She broke her own record about two years later.&nbsp; She has set a record for swimming the channel between Catalina Island and the California mainland.&nbsp; She swam the Cook Strait between both islands of New Zealand, the Strait of Magellan, the Cape of Good Hope, the Bering Strait and finally off the coast of Antarctica.&nbsp; She has an amazing ability to swim in cold waters that would induce hypothermia in&nbsp;minutes for the&nbsp;average person.  I have found myself very inspired by her story.&nbsp; Perhaps it's because the past week I have found myself frustrated by challenges with my personal goals.&nbsp; What would it be like to throw caution to the wind and just do what I really want to do?&nbsp; More importantly, how can I be sure that what I think I really want to do is really what I want to do?&nbsp; What steps do I take today?&nbsp; What direction do I go in?&nbsp; My head tells me to do some things, but are they old programming of limiting beliefs from my childhood or my sense of True North?  I was speaking with Joan the other evening and she mentioned that she thought my purpose in life was to be funny.&nbsp; "Have you ever thought of being a commediene?"  "But I'm not funny, Joan."  "Yes, you are.&nbsp; You're hillarious!"  "No, you don't understand.&nbsp; That's not me being funny.&nbsp; That's just who I am.&nbsp; I'm not trying to be funny; it's just the way I see the world and express myself.&nbsp; If I tried to be a stand-up commediene, I would fail because I would be trying to be funny."  "Then you should write a comedic screenplay."  "That's what I did with the  urlLink Perfect Pitch Contest .&nbsp; Remember?"  "I know, but something may still come of that.&nbsp; Besides, you can write another one."  It's food for thought.&nbsp; At a time when I wish I had more clarity, I feel less inclined to go to church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I was dressed and ready to go, I skipped&nbsp;the service today.&nbsp; I can't explain it any other way then by saying that the feeling that I should just stay home and read the Sunday newspaper instead was stronger than going.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was excited to see that  urlLink Best Buy  advertised that the  urlLink Scissor Sisters  album will be on sale Tuesday for $9.99.&nbsp; All I can say is that it's about time.&nbsp; I digress yet again.&nbsp;   I feel like there is something going on inside of me on the subconscious level.&nbsp; I mentioned yesterday that I felt as if I was jogging in place.&nbsp; Something is going on, but I'm not conscious of it and it bothers me.&nbsp; It's like I have spyware running.&nbsp; I've been spending a lot of time in meditation, but the only thing that comes up for me is to stay aware of what I'm feeling through out the day and not to judge or blame myself.&nbsp; The other is to write, write, write, etc.&nbsp; Does blogging count?  When Lynne Cox was crossing the Cook Strait, she was fighting unexpected tides that were carrying her out into the ocean when the weather unexpectantly changed.&nbsp; She told God that she needed His help to complete her task.&nbsp; She couldn't do it alone.&nbsp; They were in colder waters where the white pointer, also known as the great white shark, frequents and she suddenly felt a big fish moving under her.&nbsp; Fortunately, it turned out to be a pod of dolphins.&nbsp; They helped guide her along her swim.&nbsp; The dolphins&nbsp;would disappear and reappear as if on cue and led her away from rip tides and other dangers until she finished the swim.&nbsp; I am certainly open to a friendly pod of dolphins, but I guess the chances of them appearing on dry land are rather slim.&nbsp; Oh well... I'll remain open to the idea anyway.&nbsp; Love and peace.

       PUSSY AND PADS     urlLink Beastmomma  was in town today so  urlLink Joan  and I had lunch with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaspreet, AKA Beastmomma, is preparing to meet a man she met through an on-line dating service.&nbsp; They communicated through e-mail for several weeks and have now been talking on the telephone until the wee hours of the morning.&nbsp; Although it's a long story, we have begun to refer to the promising young man simply as "Samsonite." (Mr. Totes came in a close second.)   We talked about limiting the time they spend together on the first date to no more than two hours in order to avoid moving too fast.&nbsp; After all, there is nothing worse than having a breadstick in your mouth one minute and a turgid, throbbing penis in the next minute.&nbsp; I tend to think that if you want to see the person again, it's best to take your time.&nbsp; You have to let the pot roast simmer.   "Okay.&nbsp; Let's think of some questions you can ask to break the ice when you meet in person.&nbsp; What is your favorite song?"   "'Pussy Don't Fail Me Now' by Missy Elliot." She replied.   I looked at her a moment, non-plussed.&nbsp; "Remember the conversation we had about no fellatio on the first date?&nbsp; This song would not help us achieve that goal."   What is it with this week and the word "pussy?"&nbsp; It's not even a word that comes up with me that often.&nbsp; Yet this weekend, it has appeared like an uninvited guest and settled on my couch with its feet on the coffee table.   Jaspreet asked us to go shopping with her to find something special to wear for tomorrow.&nbsp; Now I'm not one of those gay men who dreams of stepping into Will Baker's shoes when he suddenly has&nbsp;a coronary before one of Kylie Minogue's appearances.&nbsp; I would just as soon throw some curtains around the bitch and tie&nbsp;them on with an electrical cord.&nbsp; "Kylie, the Spiderman look is FABULOUS!"   Jaspreet decided that I should call Samsonite and ask what he would be wearing on Monday evening.&nbsp; She dialed the number and handed her cell phone to me.&nbsp; The answering machine came on,&nbsp; the beep and then I was live and on the air.   "[His real name here], this is Jef and I am Jaspreet's personal life coach."   About this time Joan ran into another car that was speeding around a gas pump in the QT parking lot.&nbsp; There was a crunch and screams from the ladies.   CRUNCH!   AIGH!&nbsp;   EEK!   "I was just calling to find out what you will be wearing tomorrow evening.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Buh-bye."   My ability to stay calm in any situation never ceases to amaze me.&nbsp; Fortunately, the mishap did not result in much damage.   Beastmomma did not find anything that struck her fancy so we went to  urlLink Target  so she could buy pads.   "Are you embarrassed to be seen with me and my pads?" She asked.   "Hell no!" I replied.&nbsp; "I'm not going to be wearing them."

       A VISIT FROM REID    "I have something I want to show you," Reid said when I answered my cell phone.&nbsp; For some reason I looked around to see if I was on a hidden camera at the restaurant.&nbsp; Normally, I would hang up on somebody if they said this to me, but Reid was a friend and I was pretty sure it had nothing to do with a tattoo or genital piercing.   "Okay," I replied.&nbsp; "Jeff and I should be home by ten or so."   "Great! I should be there before eleven."   When I arrived home, Jeff and I decided it was a car.&nbsp; As interesting as Reid is, he leads a life that is on the straight and narrow so there weren't many other options.&nbsp; When he rang the doorbell, we immediately opened the door, rushed past him and said, "Where's the new car?"&nbsp; Reid smiled and led the way down to his new blue  urlLink Jaguar .&nbsp; I forget which model it was.&nbsp; My boss has a XJ, but I think I liked Reid's better.&nbsp; It was a shade of royal blue, not bright, but very pleasing.&nbsp; For some reason we immediately jumped in the car and drove to  urlLink Krispy Kreme Doughnuts & Coffee .&nbsp; They got doughnuts while I perused the T-shirts, which for some reason I found rather cool.&nbsp; They split a container of milk and ate their sweets while Reid kept looking outside to check on his car.   "I had no idea that you liked Jaguars." I mentioned casually to Reid.   "Oh, I've wanted one for a long time, but I met one of the owners of the dealership working on a political campaign and he gave me just too good of a deal to pass up."   "Well, I'm very glad that you bought something that makes you happy."   We talked about different things for awhile.&nbsp; Jeff has developed this resistance to my theory that genetics plays a good sized part in individuals with fantastic bodies.&nbsp; It's not the only thing, but&nbsp;I believe it plays a big part. &nbsp;Jeff has a nice physique and his schedule doesn't allow him to work out regularly, but he has a flat, slightly rippled stomach and very nice biceps/triceps.&nbsp; I made the comment that his genetics really play a part in maintaining that.&nbsp; Now he has to mention how he drinks water instead of soft drinks and doesn't eat French fries.&nbsp; That's when I ask about the cinnamon rolls for breakfast and all the lemonade.&nbsp;   Jeff made a comment about someone in Krispy Kreme who could have nice body like our friend, Eric, if he ate right.&nbsp; He said this as he shoved the last of his doughnut into his mouth.&nbsp; "It's what you eat," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;   "That's true," I replied, "But his genetics will allow him to quickly reshape his body with diet and exercise as opposed to someone like me who is basically as stick.&nbsp; It will take me longer and I won't be able to get as big as he could be."&nbsp;   Somehow we got on the subject of Eric's height and I mentioned that he was 6'4" and Jeff told me I was exaggerating and that Eric couldn't possibly be 6'4".&nbsp; Jeff has this habit of dismissing my credibility that makes me want to ram an ice pick through his ears.&nbsp; (Isn't love a beautiful thing?)&nbsp; I told him that Eric told me he was 6'4".&nbsp; Reid laughed because he knows Jeff.&nbsp; Jeff told me that people often exaggerate their height to make themselves feel better.&nbsp; "Wait a minute," I said.&nbsp; "Why in the world would Eric need to make himself feel better?&nbsp; The kid is a Greek god.&nbsp; Secondly, he is a model.&nbsp; He has to know his height because people are always putting him into their clothes.&nbsp; He would have to know."&nbsp;   Jeff asked Reid a question about the Jag and we never revisited the subject.

       SOMETHING GOOD   Jeff did something for me that totally blew me away.&nbsp; It was totally unexpected and really showed how much he loves me and cares about me.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with sex, but I'm very grateful.&nbsp; That's all I want to say.

       AN EVENING AT EINSTEIN'S   A friend of mine invited me to his birthday dinner at  urlLink Einstein's  last night.&nbsp; It's one of a few restaurants owned by a gay management company.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like it because they serve dessert in a test tube with dry ice.&nbsp; Ah ambiance!&nbsp; The food is pretty good too, but service has been kind of spotty in the past.&nbsp; The owners had renovated the building and it was very nice.&nbsp; It had a Pottery Barn look with an Asian accent.&nbsp; It was minimalistic with a lot of wood and very elegant.  I was a few minutes late because I opted not to park in the lot across from the restaurant.&nbsp; I can't stomach the thought of paying $10 to park for an hour or so.&nbsp; I drove around the corner and parked there for $5 less.&nbsp; That's one of the only negative things I can say about Atlanta.&nbsp; I enjoy the restaurants in Midtown, but parking is terrible.&nbsp; Back in Texas there is plenty of land to cover in cement and park an extended cab pickup on.  I was a little nervous about going last night because Jeff had to go to a barbecue benefit for an antebellum mansion here in town and I was on my own.&nbsp; I am a very shy person and at times, socially phobic.&nbsp; I can perform on stage and sing and dance without a problem.&nbsp; I can give a presentation or go to a lunch meeting with a client, but I hate going to parties where I don't know anyone and try to make small talk.&nbsp; The only person I knew last night was my friend.  We sat down at dinner and I was surrounded by folks I didn't know.&nbsp; I remained calm and started by asking those around me what they planned to order.&nbsp; Two of them copied what I had selected.&nbsp; (Wannabes!)&nbsp; Then I asked everyone what they did.&nbsp; There were a lot of Information Technology (IT) people.&nbsp; One of the guys was a legal assistant and his boyfriend was a sales representative for children's books.&nbsp; It was interesting talking to them because they had unusual stories to tell.&nbsp;   The sales representative, Joe, had a degree in radio/television production like I did and had wanted to be a screenwriter.&nbsp; I told him about the  urlLink Atlanta Screenwriters Group  and the Perfect Pitch contest.&nbsp;   Brian had been the victim of a practical joke where a "friend" had a female call him and pretend to be from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI).&nbsp; She&nbsp;accused him of being in a hit and run accident.&nbsp; He had become very upset and was furious at his friend afterward.  Personally, I would have immediately suspected it was a prank because the odds of me winning the lottery are pretty slim so I figure the odds of something terrible happening to me are pretty slim too.&nbsp; The woman asked where he was on Tuesday at 5:45pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have told her I was in a sling in my boyfriend's dungeon with a fire extinguisher up my ass, but then that's just me.&nbsp; I tend to think pretty quick on my feet.  "Isn't it illegal to impersonate someone from the GBI?" I asked.&nbsp; As it turns out, on Monday one of the attorneys in his office is going to call the female and play a prank on her as well using this angle.&nbsp; What comes around, goes around.  The other intersting person I met was a Philipino juice-bar master at  urlLink LA Fitness  in Roswell.&nbsp; She was a spitfire of energy and we kept making inuendos about all the different ways people could be juicey.&nbsp; It seemed hillarious at the time, but in hindsight....&nbsp; All I can say is I was drinking iced tea and water.  During the course of the meal, I was asked what I did for a living.&nbsp; When I replied that I was a mortgage broker, Joe mentioned that he would need one in a few months and Brian replied that he knew a girl at work who needed one.&nbsp; I suddenly felt very awkward.&nbsp; I'm not a shameless self-promoter, but gave my card to them both.&nbsp; I just don't like to mix business with pleasure per se, but I guess it was okay.&nbsp; They liked the card.&nbsp; Everyone likes the card.&nbsp; I guess it's the green and those damn hats.  When it came time to leave, I realized that I had enjoyed myself and gotten to know many new friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff was going to join us for drinks, but they were planning on going to  Wet Bar  and Jeff doesn't feel comfortable going to gay bars.&nbsp; I told my friend that the three of us would go out another time soon.&nbsp; My new friends expressed disappointment that I was not going and that made me feel good.&nbsp; Perhaps I will see them again some day.

       JOGGING IN PLACE    Do you ever have one of those days, or weeks, when you look up and realize that you've been very busy, but you're not getting any closer to accomplishing your goals?&nbsp; It feels like your a ball bouncing in place or someone jogging place.&nbsp; You keep moving, but you're not getting anywhere.   I'm one of those people that stays constantly busy.&nbsp; I'm also surrounded by many people who have turned a couch potato perspective into an art of leisure.&nbsp; They don't understand me.&nbsp; They say that I do too much and it wears them out just thinking about it.&nbsp; Although I believe that we should all take time each day to relax and do something we enjoy, these naysayers annoy the hell out of me.&nbsp; I sometimes feel as if they are not trying to support me, but in fact pull me down.&nbsp; I feel like Indiana Jones being tied to a love seat and forced to watch television for six hours.&nbsp; Those are six hours I will never get back.&nbsp; Instead, I try to look at where the majority of my time is going and figure out if these activities are helping me move to where I want to be.&nbsp; I'm finding that I do a lot of things around the house that are busy work and I can probably figure out a more efficient way to achieve all of my tasks.   I was overwhelmed this morning when I got up.&nbsp; I sat down to meditate to figure out what is going on in inside me.&nbsp; The impression I had is that there are a few things that I have said I want to accomplish, but I'm not eager to do them.&nbsp; I put them first on my list of things to do today.&nbsp; I figure when I can scratch these things off my list, my energy will start moving again.&nbsp; It's odd to think of, but basically everything is about energy, isn't it?

       WHAT SHE'S AFRAID OF   Every once in a while I like to remind myself that the world does not revolve around me.&nbsp; I also need to remind myself that there is 90% of the world that does not identify as homosexual.&nbsp; I would like to say that I like straight people.&nbsp; I think God gave homosexuals&nbsp; heterosexuals to enjoy.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; However, I really do think that it's important to have&nbsp;a diverse set of friends.&nbsp; My straight friends are just as important as my gay friends.&nbsp; Male and female are both equal in my book.&nbsp; (However, if the woman has a bigger penis, she may gain a competitive edge.) I enjoy having friends of different ethniticities and cultures because I find it makes me a richer person and cultivates understanding.&nbsp; This can be difficult because the gay community can sometimes insulate itself away from the rest of the world or anything considered "unfabulous."&nbsp;   While reading  urlLink Beastmomma 's blog at lunch, she commented on a theatrical production that she went to see last evening where people did dramatic self-portraits.&nbsp; In particular, one said, "Two things I fear are marrying a wife beater and&nbsp;my father dying before we can mend&nbsp;our relationship."&nbsp;   I was struck by how powerful are words are.&nbsp; Individually, the may not carry much meaning with the exception of some like: I; nigger, Madonna; and Cher. Some words carry a lot of punch in themselves or are branding.&nbsp; However, when you begin to rearrange words to imply meaning, you paint on an emotional canvas. Perhaps that is why I like the challenge of writing free verse poetry. Now, look again at the words the woman said: "Two things I fear are marrying a wife beater and my father dying before we mend our relationship."&nbsp; I have never met this woman, but I know many things about her and I could probably write a pretty accurate story about her based upon the information carried in thosee 18 words.&nbsp; It really makes you think.  I'll leave you with some Beastmomma's own impressions of this woman's words:   As she was talking about her dad, she began crying. I wanted to rush on stage and give her a hug or save her or protect her or reassure her.&nbsp; Then she talked about the things she hoped, the first being to marry a good man because she thought she deserved it and two mend things with her dad. I was struck with her choice of the phrase "I think I deserve a good man."&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that we all waver between what we fear, what we hope, and what we believe we deserve.&nbsp;

       EATING PUSSY   I don't think it's possible for the stereotypical heterosexual male to own a cat.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Picture this, an orange tabby sitting on the couch next to his owner, a young male in his mid 20's.&nbsp; The cat is cleaning himself meticulously as the guy talks to his friend on the phone about women and sex.&nbsp; The cat's eyes grow heavy and he's just about to fall asleep when he hears his owner utter the words, "I just want to eat some pussy, ya know man?"&nbsp; Immediately the cat runs to the back bedroom and puts some cat nip, Friskies and his favorte cat toy in a banadana, ties it to a little stick and takes off down the road.&nbsp; The English language is funny animal.

       DOESN'T EVERYONE HAVE A TOXIC PUSSY?   I went to Casino Night for the Kennesaw Business Association, which was sponsored by one of my PowerCore friends.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; They had black jack, poker and all the different games at various tables.&nbsp; Most of all, it was fun just to sit around with my PowerCore members and watch them smoke and drink.&nbsp; Everyone is so happy when they drink.  Mo had heard that I came in fourth at the  Perfect Pitch Contest  and asked me about it.  "What did you do?&nbsp; Are you an actor?" She asked.  "No.&nbsp; I wrote a screenplay and had the opportunity to pitch it to five people from the film industry at the  Atlanta Film Festival ."  "I just can't believe that anyone would choose anyone over you.&nbsp; You are so funny and talented."&nbsp; Mo is my biggest fan.  "Well, the guy who placed first had a very commercial idea and he pitched the best.&nbsp; He really nailed it.&nbsp; The alternate who came in second had a good story idea that I would have put in the top three as well."  "What about the third?"  "Well, I thought she was another alternate and pitched okay, but her script was about a cat that escapes from a lab and kills people by passing deadly gas.&nbsp; It was called  Toxic Pussy .&nbsp; It's a great title, but the story did not appeal to me."  Mo just looked at me for a moment.&nbsp; "Did you say  Toxic Pussy ?"  "Yes, I did.&nbsp; I was told that it was a very close decision between her script and mine and they chose her.&nbsp; So the top three scripts are sent to people in New York and L.A. to be read and they choose one winner to fly to L.A. in December."  "I can't believe you were beat by a  Toxic Pussy .&nbsp; You must have been so disappointed."  "Well, yes and no. I figure things happen for a reason and maybe it was just their time.&nbsp; I'm happy for them.&nbsp; Another opportunity will come along for me."  "That's such a great attitude."  "Thank you."  Mo took a drag on her cigarette and picked up her glass.&nbsp; She paused before bringing it to her lips.&nbsp; "Doesn't everyone have a  Toxic Pussy ?"  I coughed as beer went down my windpipe.&nbsp; "I beg your pardon?"  "I have a  Toxic Pussy  too!" She said, bobbing her head with emphasis.&nbsp; "We all have someone who has come along and seemed to have snatched our opportunity away from us.&nbsp; We may have felt like we were cheated, but we just have to trust that everying does happen for a reason."  I smiled.&nbsp; "Mo, your  Toxic Pussy  is very deep."

       A FORGOTTEN NIGHT AT THE OSCARS    urlLink Andymatic  had an interesting link to a  urlLink cuddle party  on his blog today.&nbsp; Basically, it's an event where people get together in a safe space where they can be physically affectionate in a non-sexual way.&nbsp; Think of building a fort with the cushions from the couch.&nbsp; I think it's a great idea.&nbsp; So many people in our country have so many barriers up and don't realize they are starved for physical affection.&nbsp; However, I will admit that I'm a little leary of letting anyone get too far into my personal space without knowing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there were a few Saturday nights after several drinks where I made some exceptions.&nbsp; Human behavior is so contradictory.  I wonder if a cuddle party would be helpful for women who have been raped or sexually abused in their past or gay men who have recently been diagnosed HIV positive?&nbsp; Then again, how would would our girlfriends/boyfriends react to us cuddling with others?&nbsp; Could we have an open-cuddling relationship?&nbsp; What if you had the opportunity to cuddle with someone you found very physically attractive?&nbsp; Would the cuddling only excite you more or help you achieve a different space with that person?&nbsp; It's all very interesting.  It reminded me of an experience I had many years ago.&nbsp; I had a friend when I lived in Dallas who worked as a male escort.&nbsp; In fact, he may have ran the company.&nbsp; He was never clear on the details.&nbsp; It was his nebulous edges that I found interesting.&nbsp; Anyway, one evening he asked if I would do a job for him and I told him no.&nbsp; He knew that I needed some extra money to pay an unexpected bill and my portion of the fee would be about $20 shy of covering it.&nbsp; He told me that the job didn't require any sex.&nbsp; It seems there was an older gentleman in town and he wanted company for the evening.&nbsp; It seems my friend overbooked himself or had wanted to spend time with his new boyfriend of the week.&nbsp; I think he actually told me one excuse before and one after.&nbsp; I agreed to do it, but I was a little nervous.&nbsp;   So I drove the hotel, which I want to say was on the other side of I-35 in the designer district.&nbsp; It may have been the Marriot or the Hyatt.&nbsp; I can't remember now that I no longer live there.&nbsp; Anyway, I went up to the room and knocked on the door.&nbsp; A man in his late forties answered.&nbsp; He was dressed nicely and invited me in.&nbsp; He was an attractive guy and he may have carried a few extra pounds, but I found it odd that he would call an escort service for company.&nbsp; I called my friend to let him know I was there.&nbsp; There was a lounge area and we talked for a bit over some wine.&nbsp; We ordered room service and had dinner.&nbsp; Then we sat on his bed with our backs against the headboard and watched the Oscars.&nbsp; I think it was 1994.&nbsp; I remembered that he smelled very good and at one point he asked if he could put his arm around me and I told him yes.&nbsp; It felt nice.&nbsp; We laughed a lot and shared stories through out the shot.&nbsp; At some point, I fell asleep beside him and woke up later.&nbsp; The TV was turned off and he was watching me, smiling.&nbsp; I apologized and he said that he enjoyed watching me sleep.&nbsp; It was half an hour past the time I should have left.&nbsp; I told him that I enjoyed myself, but I needed to get home although I would have liked to have stayed.&nbsp; I put on my shoes and walked to the door.&nbsp; He told me I was forgetting something and motioned to the table where there were some neatly folded $20 bills.&nbsp; I told him I felt funny taking the money.&nbsp; He asked me if this was my first time and I told him it was.&nbsp; He smiled and put the money in my pocket.&nbsp; "It's not a payment," he said. "It's an investment in a bright young future."&nbsp; I smiled and I really wanted to stay the night.&nbsp; I didn't want to have sex.&nbsp; I just wanted to sleep beside him and keep him company.&nbsp;   I moved toward the door and stopped. I turned around and said, "If you're ever in town again, you more than welcome to call me.&nbsp; I mean, you can call me directly.&nbsp; I'd be happy just to share your company at no charge."&nbsp; His eyes smiled at me and he said, "I don't know that my business is ever going to bring me back to Dallas, but... in another place and time, I would have liked to have met you."&nbsp; I knew I'd never see him again, but it had nothing to do with me.&nbsp;   He opened the door for me and I turned to walk out.&nbsp; "May I kiss you?" he asked.&nbsp; I turned to him and&nbsp;nodded.&nbsp; He put his hand under my chin and pulled my lips to his.&nbsp; It was a gentle kiss with a dash of passion that&nbsp;made my lips hum.&nbsp; When he pulled away, my hand instinctively went to my lips to touch them.&nbsp; I looked into his eyes and said, "Thank you."   He looked into my eyes for a moment and said, "No, thank you." Then kissed me on my forehead and I walked out the door.&nbsp; When I reached the end of the hall, I looked back before I turned and was still watching me.&nbsp; I waved and he smiled and waved back.&nbsp;   On the elevator ride down I debated about going back, but my gut said that was the way it should be.&nbsp; For some odd reason, I actually followed my intuition and went home.&nbsp; I called my friend to tell him I made it home safely and then went to bed.&nbsp; For the longest time I kept replaying the events of the evening. I could not believe I had worked as an escort for the evening and earned $120 for not putting out.&nbsp; Maybe there was hope for gaykind.  I went over to my friends apartment the next day and gave him the money.&nbsp; He was already tired of the boyfriend of the week and asked me how it went.&nbsp; I smiled and said that it went well.&nbsp; My friend asked if he tried anything and I said no.&nbsp; He counted the money and then handed me some back and then handed me an extra $20.00.&nbsp; "What's this for?" I asked.  "He gave you a tip."&nbsp;   I looked at the additional $20 and was amazed that out of nowhere I now had enough money to cover the bill.&nbsp; "Why did he do that?&nbsp; He paid for dinner and my time."  My friend smiled at me as if were a child.&nbsp; "He enjoyed your company.&nbsp; That's how he showed his appreciation." My friend tilted his head to the right.&nbsp; "Are you sure nothing happened?"  "No," I laughed.&nbsp; "Why do you ask?"  "He called today and said that you were exceptional.&nbsp; No one has done that before."  I smiled.&nbsp; "Does he call you every time he comes to town?"  "Actually he was a new john.&nbsp; I'd never heard from him before.&nbsp; Do you think you may be interested in doing this again now that you see how easy it is?"  "No.&nbsp; I think I'd rather quit on a high note.&nbsp; I just wanted to help you out, but... if he calls you again, let me know."  My friend looked at me suspiciously and I realized that he would never believe nothing happened so I left.  I never heard from the gentelman again and I lost contact with my friend about six months later.&nbsp; I think he moved to L.A. is what I heard.&nbsp; I wondered what happened to that gentleman and what his story was, but most of all, I hope he's doing well.&nbsp; However, sometimes I like to honor him when I have a college-age waiter who gives me good service and is personable.&nbsp; I'll tip more than I should as an investment in a bright future because there was someone who saw a spark in me when all I saw was blackness.

       ADVENTURE IN THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY    When Jeff and I went to Australia with some friends a few years ago, he decided that the "R" in Cairns was pronounced subtlely when locals said the word.&nbsp; I didn't hear it.&nbsp; I asked the locals about it and they said the "R" was not pronounced.&nbsp; Jeff continued to say Cairns with a "R" in it with such conviction that soon everyone else in our group was saying it that way.&nbsp; The locals gave us funny looks.   Jeff also decided to correct me when I said the word Aboriginese when referring to the native Australians.&nbsp; He told me that there was no such word and that the proper phrase was "Aboriginal people."&nbsp; He tried to convince me that aboriginese had never been used.&nbsp; I was in the National Gallery hoping to see photographs of Kylie Minogue and Barry Humphries when I actually saw the word Aboriginese used on some text under a painting.&nbsp; Finally, I had proof.&nbsp; I pulled out my digital camera and took a close-up picture of the text.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure where the three guards came from, but after I was able to breathe again I tried to explain to them that I was not taking a picture of the painting, but of the word Aboriginese so that I could prove to my boyfriend that it was correct.&nbsp; I was pretty sure they were going to send me to Tasmania, but they just made me delete the picture from my camera.   I found Jeff a few minutes later and told him what happened.&nbsp; He told me he knew that aboriginese was correct and that he was just teasing me.&nbsp; I don't buy it.&nbsp; He was saving face after being busted.&nbsp; You know that you truly love someone when you are willing to be incarcerated in a foreign country on the other side of the world just to prove their wrong.&nbsp; Love is indeed a many splendored thing.

       VOICEOVER CLASS #3    &nbsp; My client called and was running late so we rescheduled for tomorrow at 10:00am.&nbsp; I made a quick sandwich, banana and Diet Coke and jumped in the Jefmobile, AKA '95 Mazda Miata and headed to class.&nbsp;   I drove down Decatur Avenue, which becomes something else downtown.&nbsp; I drove by the statue of Grady, who invented anesthesia.&nbsp; I also drove by the hotel that caught fire during the 40's while several honor students were in town for a junior political convention.&nbsp; It was the worst fire tragedy of the time and may still be.&nbsp; As a result of that fire, we now have fire escapes and most of the safety requirements in hotels that we have now.&nbsp; There's a lot of history in Atlanta in spite of the fact that many people think Sherman burned everything down.&nbsp; Of course, we do a pretty good job of tearing down what Sherman left standing in order to build parking garages or Starbucks.  I arrived at class early and showed up just as Stuart, my instructor, arrived with another student.&nbsp; He's 66yo, white hair, goatee and carrying a few extra pounds.&nbsp; He sat next to me tonight, which meant I had to be on my toes.&nbsp; I never had a nap today so I found myself becoming very drowsy during class.&nbsp; It's not an indication of my interest; I'm just tired.  Mr. Crush was back tonight.&nbsp; He brought a copy of Maxim and kept going on and on about the pictures.&nbsp; Perhaps my Gaydar is broken, but he did seem to go on and on about those pictures&nbsp;quite a bit.&nbsp; "What's the story Lady MacBeth?"&nbsp; Personally, I'd prefer that he is straight with no interest in me because I'm "occupado."&nbsp; However, I am open to making new friends.&nbsp; I guess I just get suspcious when people seem that excited about me from the first time I meet them.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I don't have self-esteem issues.&nbsp; It just seems unhealthy when you meet someone and they show so much interest in you from the very beginning.&nbsp; There needs to be time to get to know people better before they want to be your best friend.  We read passages of poetry tonight.&nbsp; I think I made progress with my blending.&nbsp; It's not as easy as it sounds.&nbsp; I find myself trying to blend all the consonants at the end of words with the vowels at the beginning of the words that follow.&nbsp; Plus, he wanted us to read with meaning and phrasing.&nbsp; I sound like I'm learning to read in the first grade, but I think I made some progress.&nbsp; Each week he gives us a few more details that we didn't have the following week.  There are a lot of actors in my class.&nbsp; I think they're kind of weird.&nbsp; It takes a lot for me to say someone is weird since I tend to march to the beat of my own drum as well.&nbsp; These people are  proud  actors.&nbsp; They leap at every opportunity to interpret every word on the page outloud.&nbsp; I really don't think it was necessary to recite the class phone list with such emotion, but the magic seems to be lost on me.&nbsp; Suzanne wants to do books on tape.&nbsp; She stretches out everything she reads and it makes me uncomfortable for her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She creates a character for everything she does.&nbsp; So if you need someone to read a recipe for green bean casserole from the perspective of a single mother on death row, she's your girl.  Connor is very enthusiastic.&nbsp; He's enthusiastic for about ten people.&nbsp; I wish I had his enthusiasm.&nbsp; There is an urgency to everything he reads.&nbsp; It's the urgency of someone who has to urinate very badly and there is nary a restroom in sight.  There is another guy in the class. I can't remember his name, but he reads everything in this strange Paul Harvey versus Phyllis Diller voice.&nbsp; It is very different from the way he normally talks, but he seems to use it as his professional stage voice.&nbsp; It reminds of the voice you would match with a puppet for the Head Elf at the North Pole Toy Factory.&nbsp; He speaks very loud.&nbsp; I can almost picture the Head Elf saying, "Now don't mix the Betsy Westy dolls with the vibrators or someone is going to get hurt."  When it' s my turn to read, I find myself becoming uncomfortable.&nbsp; I just want to read normally.&nbsp; I don't want to experiment with all the various ways we can say, "Guns and drums and drums and guns!"&nbsp; I think I have issues.&nbsp; A friend told me that my fifth chakra is constipated.&nbsp; I'm going to have to spin the wheel and clear that sucker out.&nbsp; Daddy's got to master this so I can become a voice for a character on  Space Ghost .&nbsp; I think it's important to have goals.  I realized tonight that Stuart is the voice of all those commercials you see on television for the Ford F-10 or S-10 pickups.&nbsp; He's done commercials with Alan Jackson.&nbsp; I forget how much is done right here in Atlanta.  Stuart told us tonight that at his age, he finally understands how to play King Lear.&nbsp; It's the only Shakespearan role he has not performed.&nbsp; Only now he says he's too old and he'd have to drag the bitch in by her hair.&nbsp; This is a colorful expression for saying that he is no longer capable of carrying his dead daughter onto the stage as written in the play.  In other news, Stuart's grandson is obsessed with his penis. And what 6yo is not?&nbsp; He also has a desire to see his teacher's underwear.&nbsp; Dont' we all?&nbsp; The little nipper also has some great advice for us voiceover students - "Fuck the punctuation!"&nbsp; Words to live by.

       EVERYONE LAY ON THE FLOOR AND REMAIN CALM   I know many of you are most likely suffering from Jef withdrawals.&nbsp; It can't be helped, I'm afraid.&nbsp; I'm highly addictive.  This morning was my usual up at 5:30am to be at the PowerCore meeting in Marietta by 7:00am.&nbsp; I was feeling a bit tired and my throat was scratchy.&nbsp; Naturally, I was picked to go first with my InfoMinute.&nbsp; I continued where I left off last week when my mind went completely blank.&nbsp; For some reason my fellow networking group members think I'm funny.&nbsp; When my blanked out last week, I made a little joke and all was forgiven.&nbsp; They went on about the rest of the meeting.&nbsp; The InfoMinute went well.&nbsp; I discussed "no doc" loans, which means that your credit score is so good, you can get away without showing income or assets.&nbsp; Of course, your rate is higher, but there is usually a reason you can't show income or assets right now.  Afterwards, I followed up with my realtor partners and clients and then went to Best Buy to purchase a HP DVD Writer.&nbsp; I need to archive some pictures and music files.&nbsp; I'm trying to archive my massive CD collection in a more managable format and I figure DVD is the best format since each one holds 4.37GB.&nbsp;  urlLink Jesse  put the idea in my head a few months ago.  I spoke with a good friend in Kansas City this afternoon while waiting for my client to arrive.&nbsp; It's amazing how even when we haven't talked in months, it's always like just picking up where we left off.&nbsp; If anyone was my spiritual soulmate, it would have to be him.&nbsp; I'll tell you the story some time.&nbsp; It's very strange.  I tried to blog earlier, but Blogger was down.&nbsp; I'm not enjoying some of the new Blogger formats.&nbsp;

       PHOTOSHOP TO THE RESCUE   &nbsp;  One of the greatest inventions of the last decade or so has to be Adobe PhotoShop.&nbsp; It cane remove powerlines from your favorite scenic photograph or enlarge the girth and length of your male member to fire extinguisher size proportions.&nbsp; Of course this begs the question, "Do people kill other people or does PhotoShop kill people?"&nbsp; Wait a minute!&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; I'm just trying to point out that basically most things are simply what they are.&nbsp; They are nothing in themselves, but only have the importance that we put on them.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For instance, money is just bits of paper or metal coins.&nbsp; It signifies a value for bartering in our world based upon agreed trades of energy.&nbsp; I agree to do extend this much of my energy for you in exchange for this much money.&nbsp; PhotoShop is just a tool.&nbsp; It helps us edit digital images, create websites, etc.&nbsp; Yet I can't help but wonder what the use of a particular tool says about our culture.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I did not think it was possible for me to receive any more porn spam than I do, but it has increased this week.&nbsp; What have I ever done to give anyone the impression that I would be eager to see horny teenage girls performing fellatio on a horse.&nbsp; There are only two things that one should do in a stable in my book: keep a horse; and/or have a baby.&nbsp; I've also begun receiving e-mails that show women being serviced by men with gargantuan mutated phalluses.&nbsp; There is now way these images can be real.&nbsp; If they were, the man would pass out every time he sported&nbsp;a woody.&nbsp; The human brain could not support that much loss of blood to any other part of the body.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I wonder what people will think of our culture when they look back a hundred years from now?&nbsp; Will they say, "Oh they dressed funny and liked to enlarge their genitalia through digital imaging."?&nbsp; It just seems like if you have enough of these porn spam e-mails flying around the Internet that historians will most likely think that was the interest of the population as a whole based upon volume.&nbsp; Then again, what if I'm the only person in the world receiving these e-mails?&nbsp; I shudder to think of it.  &nbsp;  I was reading another blog where someone mentioned removing&nbsp;himself from a photograph via PhotoShop.&nbsp; I think it would be great if you could just remove anything you don't like in your own live with PhotoShop.&nbsp; If you don't like your co-worker who sits next to you, rub her out with the eraser tool in PhotoShop.&nbsp; If you don't like your boyfriend's buddies, take 'em out.&nbsp; If you don't like your president, hmmm....&nbsp; Can it really be that easy to get rid of a Bush?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; As a country, we can't seem to decide on anything and the Republicans and Democrats just bicker between each other.&nbsp; We would have so many political leaders being rubbed out of office each second that it would seem like one of those cartoons that send Japanese school children into seizures.  &nbsp;  All in all, I was quite shocked to realize that there aren't really any people that I can't stand.&nbsp; There are a few people whose personalities don't click with mine, but nothing I can't work around for us to remain pleasant.&nbsp; For the most part, I get on with just about everybody.&nbsp; What a waste of PhotoShop.&nbsp; I guess I'll just have to make my genitalia bigger.

       RAINBOW BOYS   &nbsp;  Now that 2F's is collecting books for his store, it's always interesting to see what he comes home with from book buying expeditions.&nbsp; It's sort of like rushing to the bottom of a box of cereal or Cracker Jacks.  &nbsp;  Recently he came home with a copy of  Rainbow Boys  by Alex Sanchez.&nbsp; I recognized the book and recalled that one member of my writing group actually knows Alex.&nbsp; I decided to read it and I have to say it's like reading a gay Harry Potter.  &nbsp;  The story is about three high school seniors who are all at some point in their coming out process.&nbsp; Nelson is your loud and queer student.&nbsp; Kyle, his best friend, is the studious member of the swim team and Jason is the basketball player caught between his girlfriend and his attraction for Kyle.&nbsp; Each chapter is from the perspective of a different character and it's an addictive read.&nbsp; I read 170 pages last night and would have read more if I had not made myself go to bed.&nbsp; I have come to realize that I'm a romance junkie.&nbsp; After I got over the initial shock, I have accepted the fact that I enjoy a good love story.&nbsp; I don't mean sex.&nbsp; I mean love story and  Rainbow Boys  has a good one.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am really impressed at how Alex worked so many contemporary themes into this book.&nbsp; It is amazing how things have changed since I first came out in 1989 as compared to how things are now days.&nbsp; GLBT kids come out on average at the age of 15.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  2F's had already made it through half of the book before I picked it up.&nbsp; (The man reads at light speed.)&nbsp; I was asking him last night about his impressions of the story and he gave it good marks.&nbsp; He said it made him wonder what his life would have been like if (a) he had realized he was gay when he was a teenager, (b) it had been more acceptable to be gay at that time, and (c) his religious beliefs had not prevented him from accepting his sexuality.&nbsp; There was quite a bit of sadness in his voice when he said this.&nbsp; It's not because he wanted to go out and sow his wild oats.&nbsp; That's not the kind of guy he is.&nbsp; My partner did not come out until he was almost 38 years old and the progress he has made has been impressive.&nbsp; Still, it has to be difficult to have lived almost 40 years without consciously knowing who and what you are and being unable to accept it.&nbsp; Looking on the bright side, at least he is aware of&nbsp;who and what he is&nbsp;now and takes each day as it comes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's living his life more fully, but he still has his challenging moments.&nbsp; I've noticed that with each year there seems to be more of a modest activist coming to life in him.&nbsp; All in all, I'm very proud of him. &nbsp;  I found this information on Alex's website that might be helpful for any writers out there:  &nbsp;   What advice would you give to young writers?     Have you ever been to a museum and seen an art student with an easel copying a painting hanging on the wall? The equivalent applies to writing. Take a book that moves you and actually copy your favorite parts. It will reveal much about what makes good writing. It's a great way to learn.  In addition, read your work aloud. When you write, appeal to as many of the reader's senses as possible-visual images, sounds, tastes, smells, and textures. Use dialog sparingly. Actions really do speak louder than words. And above all, surround yourself with people who will give you confidence and build you up as a writer. Encouragement is so important. &nbsp;

       SHALL WE DANCE?  &nbsp; Whilst waiting for my pot roast to simmer, I explored another new blog.&nbsp; Check out today's entry on  urlLink Confessions Of A Gay Guy , which is  Dances With Goats .&nbsp; It's very clever, probably true and both shocking and amusing.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; It's time to turn my rump roast over.

       THIS IS WHAT BLOGGING IS ALL ABOUT   &nbsp;  I've been roaming the Internet looking at other blogs, particularly by people whose lives are not similar to mine - gay white male with a three-legged cat and obsessed with Bananarama and shark research.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I found a blog by  urlLink Linda  and her last entry regarding abortion from July 19th was very powerful.&nbsp; I highly recommend reading it and giving her some feedback.&nbsp; Her story is very moving and shows just how complicated our decisions can be.&nbsp; Furthermore, at times we may even choose for freedoms for all even though in certain circumstances we may choose not to embrace that freedom.  &nbsp;  I don't know how many of you have ever read  urlLink Rebecca Blood 's book on weblogs, but in the beginning she mentions how many of them consisted of posting links to different topics and issues and showing both sides of the coin.&nbsp; The purpose was to have readers learn more about each side and come to their own conclusions and comment.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The Internet community is a powerful ware to share information and ideas in a way that forces us to think and sift through our identities in ways to constantly reshape ourselves.&nbsp; We are not stagnant; we are ever changing.&nbsp; I like the idea of going to to a website and being moved by something I read as well as receiving a laugh.&nbsp; I like reading retelling of private moments that may have no significance to anyone else, but remain special to the author.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We are truly a global village and my perspective is being changed to encompass the opinions and needs of people beyond Atlanta and beyond the U.S.&nbsp; Even though we all may be miles apart, our words and thoughts keep us all nearer than our hearts.

       I, ROBOT  &nbsp; Jefffifer went to see I, Robot with Paul, Boo, Rachel and Doug last night.&nbsp; We went to the Buckhead Backlot where you can eat dinner while you watch the movie. It's basically bar food and the service is much to be desired, but it is convenient at times.&nbsp; There were other movies I probably would have seen before this one, but most of our group had already seen them so I was ready to see this movie.&nbsp; The effects looked cool and the robots reminded me of Bjork's video for  urlLink All Is Full Of Love . &nbsp; I have never read the original short story, but I believe the only thing that remained from Isaac Aismov's prose are the three laws.&nbsp; Everything else was new.&nbsp; The acting was good. The action was good.&nbsp; It was your basic formula-driven, summer blockbuster. &nbsp; Will Smith once again plays an angry blackman and it works well with this story.&nbsp; He's definitely kept up with his workout regime since  Ali  because I was impressed with his body.&nbsp; He has a definite V-shape and his legs look massive.&nbsp; We really didn't need the shot of his naked butt in the shower, but I guess it's the obligatory eye candy.&nbsp;  &nbsp; After the movie was over, I wondered if I made a movie called  Uncircumcized , would it be politically correct to sell a DVD with the Director's Cut.

       HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO JEFFFIFER   &nbsp;  Jeff and I have officially been together for seven years as of July 15th.&nbsp; When I look back, on some levels I think it's amazing that we have stayed together for so long.&nbsp; On other levels, it makes perfect sense.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In the beginning, I kind of made a big deal about it and he looked at me as if I had suggested that we take Ground Hog Day off and throw a party.&nbsp; Eventually, I just settled for realizing it had come and passed a few weeks earlier.&nbsp; I would look up from the newspaper and say to him, "By the way, happy belated anniversary."&nbsp; Then I would go back to&nbsp;Marilyn Van Savant in  Parade Magazine .  &nbsp;  This year has probably been the most challenging.&nbsp; I've basically gone to work for myself and Jeff is trying to start his own business in his spare time.&nbsp; Also, we've basically gotten to the point where we no longer treat each other with kid gloves and just say it like it T-I-S.&nbsp; This doesn't always go over well.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Romance is still there, but we're not quite as lusty as we once were.&nbsp; Well, looking back, I may have only been the lusty one from the beginning.&nbsp; I've gotten to the point where I'm quite satisfied to kiss him goodnight and disappear into a good book.&nbsp; "How will Harry escape from Snape this time?"  &nbsp;  A few days after Jeff came back from Central America, we sat upstairs and discussed our relationship and our differences.&nbsp; Neither one of us is sure that we completely understand where the other is coming from, but we have decided that we are both committed to one another to make it work.&nbsp; I just can't imagine being with anyone else.&nbsp; He can't either.&nbsp; Afterwards, we made out on the bed for an hour like a couple of horny teenager after a football game in the back of a Pinto.  &nbsp;  I made reservations at  urlLink Pricci's .&nbsp; My boss gave me a gift card to the  urlLink Buckhead&nbsp; Life Restaurant Group  for Christmas and I decided to take us out for a nice dinner to celebrate.&nbsp; When he came home, he brought me some roses.&nbsp; In fact, I'm looking at them now and they are orange, pink, yellow and white.&nbsp; They have opened up and are quite beautiful and fragrant.&nbsp; It really allowed me to get in touch with my inner teenage girl, albeit I didn't cry or anything.&nbsp; It just made me feel gooey inside.  &nbsp;  I actually put on&nbsp; a tie and we went to dinner.&nbsp; It was very nice.&nbsp; We had baked lobster crepes for an appetizer and followed it with a seafood salad for me and a salad that focused on tomatoes for him.&nbsp; For entrees, I had toretelli and he had something meaty that was once part of an animal.&nbsp; I can't remember now because we tossed so many things around.&nbsp; I want to say it was a lamb shank or something.&nbsp; Afterwards we had coffee and tiramisu.&nbsp; I will admit that you could definitely tell it was made from scratch, but I still favored Publix tiramisu over Pricci's dessert.&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was pretty stuffed from eating so much.&nbsp; I went to the restroom and they had the hallway lined with photographs of celebrities.&nbsp; There was a pic of Elton John and Rod Stewart with a couple of women.&nbsp; There was a picture of Steve Martin with Anne Heche before Ellen entered the picture.&nbsp; It was interesting.  &nbsp;  We laughed a lot and came home.&nbsp; I slipped into bed with a good book and he instantly fell asleep.&nbsp; I finished reading the  urlLink The Blue Meridian: The Search For The Great White Shark . It is the story of how some filmmakers went about shooting the documentary  urlLink Blue Water, White Death , which is the first time anyone captured the great white shark on movie film.&nbsp; Peter Benchley used it as the basis of his research as he was writing  Jaws .&nbsp; Jeff bought the book for me at a yard sale because he knows how much I love sharks.&nbsp; In fact, if I had to list any true heroes, I would have to name Ron and Valerie Harper, two Australian naturalists (wildlife, not nudists) who have brought more attention to how amazing sharks are than anyone else on the planet.  &nbsp;  After I finished the book, it was late and I looked over at Jeff sprawled out on the side of the bed, hair askew and his mouth open.&nbsp; I thought he looked very beautiful.&nbsp; It was like the way that the author described the shark in the book.&nbsp; Yes, they sometimes attack people by mistake, but if you truly look at great white sharks for the perfect creations of nature they are, they seem so beautiful.&nbsp; Yes, sometimes Jeff and I don't agree on some things.&nbsp; However, I cannot ever imagine loving anyone more beautiful than him.

       NATIONAL ICE CREAM DAY   &nbsp;  It makes your nipples get hard just thinking about it, doesn't it?&nbsp; And I don't just mean that because ice cream is cold.&nbsp; Nothing makes me more excited than a though of going to  urlLink Jake's Ice Cream &amp; Sorbets .&nbsp; I'll probably go up there on my way to the grocery store this evening.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I wonder what flavors they have today?&nbsp; Some of my favorites include: Chocolate Slap Yo Mama; Chocolate Cinnamon; Devyn's Animal Crackers; Thin Mint (tastes like Girl Scout Cookies); Chocolate Pecan&nbsp;Piescream; Chocolate Leya Cake; Mexican Hot Chocolate;&nbsp;Tiramisu; B's Straweberry Cheesecake and Cotton Candy.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, I have delayed starting&nbsp; urlLink The Abs Diet  until tomorrow.

       LIKE CATWORK  &nbsp; The weather is warm now and Buddy, my cat, enjoyes spending days in the backyard.&nbsp; She's a little tortise shell manx sans one rear leg.&nbsp; Every morning she wakes me up with a loud "blah, blah" sound, which means, "Feed me and let me outside!"&nbsp; I dutifully put food in her bowl, check her water and then let her outside.&nbsp; She usually sits by the backdoor looking at me until I get the message.&nbsp; Typically, I will brush her first.&nbsp; Then I let her out and she sits in the doorway as if suddenly changing her mind.&nbsp; Sometimes I can count to three and she will quickly wiggle out.&nbsp; Other times I nudge her with my foot.&nbsp; I'll usually put her food and water out with her.&nbsp; She'll sit on the back deck steps, looking around and sleeping.&nbsp; Sometimes she goes under the house.&nbsp; Other times she'll sleep under the shade of the fig tree.&nbsp; Late at night, she's at the back door, ready to come home and back inside.&nbsp; She's had a hard day at work, just lazing around.&nbsp; It's kind of cute.&nbsp; If only she had a little metal lunchbox to go with her each morning.

       MEET ME AT APPLEBEE'S  &nbsp; The day started off with a phone call early this morning.&nbsp; It was a referral from a recent couple that I helped to finance their new home.&nbsp; The man was interested in taking cash out of his home to purchase a hotel/motel.&nbsp; I got the basic information and was able to prequalify him easily for the mortgage.&nbsp; Today was his day off and he wanted to meet to take the application today.&nbsp; I told him I would call him back after lunch to set a time.&nbsp; I hung up and realized that I needed to leave shortly to make my closing at 10:00am. &nbsp; I quickly showered and headed up to Lenox for my closing.&nbsp; The attorney has a new attorney that has started in his office.&nbsp; The new attorney has an unusual name.&nbsp; I've often thought I would like to be a real estate attorney. &nbsp; I rushed home and started pulling the preliminary paperwork together for my appointment that afternoon.&nbsp; I spoke with the boss about doing commercial loans.&nbsp; Evidently, I can.&nbsp; I have the power!&nbsp;&nbsp;I met George for lunch and then returned home to finish prepping the file.&nbsp; One of my other clients called a few minutes before I had planned to call him.&nbsp; I gave him his weekly update, which I do every Friday.&nbsp; He was happy with the information and I drove out to Stone Mountain for my appointment. &nbsp; On the way, I received a phone call from my friend, Steve, in Dallas.&nbsp; He brought me up to speed on what's been going on with him.&nbsp; His boyfriend has gone back to prison and he starts a new job with a mortgage company on Monday.&nbsp; I lost his call once I drove past Stone Mountain, which is a huge mountain of granite outside of Atlanta.&nbsp; It has a relief of three of the greatest heroes of the Civil War and on Summer evenings they do a laser shon on the mountain. &nbsp; I met my client at Applebee's and we took care of the paperwork.&nbsp; Afterwards, we talked for a long time.&nbsp; He told me about his family, their roots in India, growing up in England, his views on the world today and that money isn't everything.&nbsp; I shared some of my own history and perspectives with him and we really connected.&nbsp; It was so cool.&nbsp; He also said some things that were perfectly timed for me to hear.&nbsp; It's kind of spooky when the universe conspires to bring these type of experiences about. &nbsp; I thought of Jaspreet, AKA Beastmomma, and a story I have thought about writing based upon her experiences.&nbsp; The working title is  Punjabi Girl .&nbsp; I may write out the treatment this weekend if I have the time. &nbsp; My client asked what I enjoyed best about my work and I replied, "I enjoy problem solving and helping people.&nbsp; I like building relationships with people."&nbsp; I think I did this afternoon.

       LAST NIGHT I HEARD CARUSO SING   &nbsp;  As I was reading in bed last night, I heard the faint sound of someone singing and playing a guitar.&nbsp; It was an unusually cool night for July and we had the windows open upstairs.&nbsp; I listened closely and determined it was a male voice.&nbsp; "Who could it be at this hour?" I thought to myself as I realized he was playing a guitar as well.&nbsp; It then dawned on me that it was Jay, my next-door-neighbor, singing to his newborn son, Edwin.&nbsp; I turned out the light to help focus my concentration and hear better.&nbsp; I lay in the dark listening to the singing.&nbsp; I couldn't really make out the words or the melody, but it was soothing.&nbsp; I pictured Edwin slowly going to sleep to his father's serenade.&nbsp; I wondered if he would ever remember this moment when he was older.&nbsp; I wondered if Jay would ever remember this moment when Edwin was older.&nbsp; "Isn't it amazing?" I thought to myself, "How one spontaneous decision to pick up a guitar and sing to your child can have emotional reverberations for the rest of his life, and perhaps, through out time.&nbsp; It was a pebble thrown into the water, so to speak.&nbsp; I fell asleep soon after.

       HE'S GOT TACT   &nbsp;  Yes, one of the rarest finds of all Bananarama memorabilia is on  urlLink eBay  and I'm thinking about buying it.&nbsp; In 1983, Bananarama recorded  He's Got Tact  as a promotion for Honda Scooters in Japan and appeared in a commercial with Peter Fonda.&nbsp; It's never appeared on any album or CD.&nbsp; It's the only one of their 39-singles that I do not own.&nbsp; You're probably thinking, "39 singles?! I thought they only released  Cruel Summer ,  Venus  and  I Heard A Rumour ."&nbsp; It's not the greatest song they ever recorded.&nbsp;It reminds you of girl group songs from the 60's, albeit the lyrics about getting into a fight with a girl in a bar make me smile.&nbsp; It's simple, early, shambolic Bananarama.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things seemed so much more innocent and pure back then... or were they?

        I'LL HAVE THE GEORGE SALAD       &nbsp;  I met my favorite realtor partner at  Heaping Bowl  this afternoon for lunch.&nbsp; I love George.&nbsp; He gave me my first real break when I first started in the business and has continued to send clients my way.&nbsp; In fact, he's even given me some of his own personal business.&nbsp; I love working with George because he's just a lot of fun.&nbsp; George always calls me "honey" or "sunshine" and he doesn't take it all too seriously.&nbsp; You just can't and stay sane.&nbsp; Plus, he just has a hillarious outlook on life and isn't afraid to say "fuck" when it needs to be said.&nbsp; Most of all, I like the way that George treats his clients.&nbsp; He treats them the way I like to be treated so I like alligning myself with other professionals like that.    &nbsp;  We talked a little business today, but we're also starting to share more about our personal lives. I like that because I think George is a great friend too.&nbsp; He basically came out in the 70's so it's interesting to get his perspective on things and how they have changed.    &nbsp;  I was surprised to learn this afternoon that George frequents  Heaping Bowl  almost daily.&nbsp; In fact, they've named a salad after him.&nbsp; It's called the  George Salad  and if you order it, they'll know what you mean.    &nbsp;  "I didn't know I was having lunch with a celebrity, George." I said.    &nbsp;  "Stick with me kid," he winked.&nbsp; "I'll teach you all the tricks."    &nbsp;  How can you not like someone like that?

       MUSIC DOWNLOAD SERVICES   Does anyone have any suggestions for websites to download songs from?  I'm looking for legal sites where you pay per song, but I want to be able to burn the song onto a CD to take with in the car.  Any suggestions and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

       ANOTHER REOCCURING DREAM   I keep having a dream that I'm helping one of the Olsen twins qualify for a mortgage.  I think it is Mary-Kate.  Is she the "fat" one?  She seems very anxious and it begins to wear off on me.  I read that she had sex with Henry Winkler's son in Italy.  I don't think I should know that.

       SUMMER NIGHTS IN ATLANTA   I love summer nights.  I like the feeling of the air conditioner on my skin while driving around at dusk.  The light is dying in the sky just as the neon is yawning to life.  I hummed Petula Clark's  Downtown  to myself.  I like the tourists buzzing about CNN Center as images of Anderson Cooper flash on the big screen on the bulding only to be replaced by the Super Friends on the Cartoon Network.  For some reason, I find Anderson Cooper sort of sexy in a repressed way.  I know he doesn't talk about his personal life, but doesn't that just scream, "GAY!"?  Maybe I would be the same way if my mother was Gloria Vanderbilt.  I bet he'd be fun to have beer with and play bar trivia together.  I can't say I've ever had sexual fantasies about him spinning me 360 degrees like a record baby, right round, round, round.  As I drove by the TBS building tonight, they had a huge billboard of Outback Jack on the side of the building.  I found it unusual that I completely ignored the shirtless guy to notice the font used in the ad.  There is something about Avant Garde that is just so sexy. Mmm... delicious.  I sort of wanted to keep driving tonight, way out into the country where it's dark and you can see the stars.  I was playing Sophie Ellis-Bextor's new album and Lipslide by Sarah Cracknell from Saint Etienne.  I could have almost driven to Athens.    Once, in the summer of '92, I woke up late at night and crept out of the house.  Susan and Joan were spending the night with Chris and I.  I drove north of Arlington on the back roads where the strip clubs like Baby Dolls are.  I kept playing a Culture Club greatest hits cassette that I had purchased at Half Price Books.  It was a private moment. It made me feel closer to something, but even now, I can't tell you what it is.  However, I can still feel it now.

       VOICEOVER, CLASS TWO   I was five minutes late tonight due to a tornado warning, some light rain and people who don't know how to drive. I hate being late.  It's so disrespectful.  I know some people have made it into an art, but that's another blog for another day.  I didn't practive much this week and I've been trying to figure out why.  I think I was intimidated by the blending exercises.  They're hard, but I practiced for a couple of hours today and I did better than I expected.  It's going to take some time master though.  On some levels, I feel like I'm learning to talk all over again.  Our instructor was the narrator for  Wings  on the Discovery Channel for many years.  He told us that the religious right is always after him to do their voiceover work because they like his voice. Problem is, he doesn't like them. Finally, his agent convinced him to do it because it was putting him in an awkward position with the ad agency.  Now he does their voiceover works and takes the money he receives and gives it to the organizations that the religious right opposes.  You gotta love that guy.  Many of the people in my class are... ACTORS.  They are very serious about it.  We had to go around the room and say who we are and why we're taking the class.  Everyone had a professional reason for doing it and I was the lone, "Well, people tell me I have a nice voice and I thought it might be fun."    Our homework was to read a monologue about Jenny.  We had to decide who we were and the context of the monologue.  Was Jenny dead?  You get the picture.  One lady volunteered and read her homework.  She was extremely over the top.  It was like being trapped in one of those read along books that comes with the narration on a record.  Tinker Bell kept ringing her bell to the turn the page and it never stopped.  I thought it was too much and my instructor loved it.  The rest of the class thought she was great too.  Naturally, I assumed that the problem must have been with me, but I kind of have a rule I follow with things like this - if that lady read that story to me that way in an elevator, would I be afraid for my life?  I'm sorry.  I would have shot her or at least demolished both knee caps with a fire extinguisher.  The rest of the class we spent reading passages of poetry, exploring phrasing and finding the cadence.  Evidently there are some new rules about blending that came up tonight that we all seemed to have missed last week.  In spite of the fact that it may sound like I didn't enjoy the class, I'm enjoying it.  It's challenging.  It inspires me to rise to the challenge.  There is an actor who is originally from Spain.  She read one passage and the instructor told her she sounded like Rosan Rosanadana from Saturday Night Live (SNL).  She looked at him blankly as everyone laughed and said, "Pop culture means nothing to me."  The instructor just sort of looked down and said, "I shouldn't have said that."  We have to come up with 15-20 radio commercials for next week.  I haven't found any on the Internet yet.  We're going to sort through them to find a few to use for demo reel.  We're supposed to choose things that we adore.  I guess that would be sex, Bananarama and Jake's ice cream.  I think the kid who sat next to me has a crush on me.  He kept watching me and hanging around me.  After class I walked outside and stopped to watch a beautiful firey sunset on the way to my car.  He came up to me and asked about our homework.  It was one of those conversations you have just to keep talking not because you really care about what you're saying.  I know it because I used to initiate those conversations.  He's really cute and my heart just goes out to him because he kind of reminds me of me.  I could totally write a little humorous love story with him in it.  Maybe I will.  He seems like a really nice kid.  Maybe we'll end up being friends and I'll be a surrogate big brother.  I'll introduce him to someone who will put him boy training and fulfill his repressed desires to explore the leather lifestyle.  Who knows?  I'm taking it one onomatopoeia at a time.

       I KNOW THERE IS A SPECIAL HELL FOR COLLECTION AGENCY EMPLOYEES   I have a friend who cannot manage her money by herself.  Her ex-husband beat her for many years and she has some cognitive difficulties.  I finally realized that no one was going to help her out and stepped into help.  I have power of attorney over her bank account and have begun paying her bills for her out of her checking account.  However, there were a few bad checks that were written before I stepped in and now the last one has showed up from a local collection agency.  In my conversation with Jay last week, I explained that my friend is only paid once a month and we have already used all of the funds to get her current on her utilities and other past due bills.  I didn't know about this check, therefore, I did not budget for it.  I explained that my friend is paid again on the 31st and we would send a money order for the full amount.  That was fine.  Yesterday I received a call from Pamela.  She could not have picked a worse time to call.  I told her that I had already worked out arrangements with Jay, however, those arrangements were now unacceptable.  I explained the situation again to Pamela whosse only comment was a cheery, "It doesn't work that way."  Being somewhat mentally deficient, Pamela asked me once again how I planned to take care of my friend's debt.  With great restraint, I gently explained to Pamela that for the last time, there is no more money in my friend's bank account.  It echoes and there will not be money again until the 31st.  Suddenly filled with the Spirit of Jesus Christ, Pamela began speaking in tongues in attempt to overpower me and we were somehow disconnected.  There were two messages on the answering machine when I returned home last night.  It was a telephone number saying that it was important to call.  There was no information about what it was regarding.  I call.  It's the same collection agency.  This time I speak with Jenny.  We go round and round again.  Finally, Jenny wants to know why I don't loan my friend the money and I said that it wasn't my responsibility.  After all, I'm already helping her.  Jenny, then began to attack me for not giving my friend the money and all she has to do is walk the file ten feet over and have it sent to the magistrate court.  "Oh look, I just found the $107.00!" I said with great excitement.  Jenny then began to tell me how I could immediately pay her over the phone.  "Jenny, I'm being ironic.  Have you not heard anything I've told you in this conversation.  There is no money to pay you right now."  Jenny told me again that I should loan my friend the money and I had to cut her off.  "Jenny, this is not about me.  I'm going to confirm with the amount that is owed and where it needs to be sent to when my friend is paid again.  I just want to confirm this since everything else I have been told has changed."  Jenny tried to divert it back to me and I had to remind her this was not my debt and she was taking me away from my work time.  I confirmed the information and hung up.  I called my friend to give her the update.  Maybe she can borrow the money from someone, but it's doubtful since she burned most the bridges long ago.  I think they were just trying to intimidate me.  Still, it's basically my friend's predicament and if she can borrow the money to pay them off, good for her.  However, I'd still like to make those people wait until the 1st.  The only thing that kept me civil on the phone today was thinking about Kathleen Turner prank calling people in  Serial Mom  and saying, "Cocksucker!" into the phone.

       INFOMINUTE FAUS PAUX   I stayed up until about one o'clock working on my short story,  Exfoliation .  Jeff had already gone to bed and I realized that he didn't set the alarm so I could get up at 5:30am.  My Timex IronMan is MIA again so I set my large, old fashioned alarm clock with the hammer between the bells and went upstairs.  I woke up every half hour thinking I had over slept and then worrying about the alarm waking Jeff up too.  At 4:15am I decided to bring the alarm back down stairs and sleep in my my/spare bedroom.  I made it to my PowerCore meeting and decided that this week's InfoMinute would answer the written questions I received from my seven-minute presentation from last week.  I had already written out what I would say and gone over it a few times so I was fairly relaxed.  My turn came and I stood up and began and then after I answered the first question, my mind went completely blank.  I stood there for about five seconds and then said, "Excuse me, I'm downloading."  Everyone laughed and I said I would continue next week.  As soon as my firm buttocks touched my seat, I remembered the second question I had planned to answer.  It worries me that there may be a connection between my ass and my short term memory.  I had breakfast with our team chiropractor after the meeting.  He's an interesting guy.  He's interested in doing motivational seminars and I referred him to the contact at my church.  He's also writing a self-help book too.  It was just like my meeting with Mike, our motivational speaker, a few weeks ago.  Speaking of Mike, he's been out in L.A. the past few weeks shooting  C.S.I. New York .  I think he has a fairly big part and it's reoccuring.  This is big break for him.  It's reassuring to see good things happen to good people.

       THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND, THIS LAND IS MY LAND   My friend, Blaise, sent me  urlLink this .  I find it to be a very skewing of both political parties.  However, I like the ending best.  The comment on what we did to Native Americans is funny only because it is atrocious what our fore fathers did to the indigenous people of North America.

       LOVE COMES IN SMALL PACKAGES   I met someone tonight at a neighborhood function who revealed to me that he has a fetish for midgets.    "I believe they prefer to be called little people."  "Little people ain't sexy.  Midget!  That's sexy."  "I can't say I've ever thought about it."  "Are you saying midgets ain't sexy people?"  I found myself becoming angry that this jerk was putting me on the spot to eroticize little people for fear of coming across as some sort of bigot.  "No, I'm not.  What I'm saying is that it never occured to me single out a physical characteristic that medical science considers a deformity, well, a physical anomaly and single that out as source of sexual excitement where as other wise ignoring the rest of the person."  He took a swig of beer and licked his lips.  "Have you ever looked at some guy and thought he had a nice ass?"  "Yeah."  "What's the difference?"  "Look, I understand what you're getting at, but it's not the same.  A nice ass is not singled out in our society."  "Hell, it ain't!"  "Not as a disability."  "You ever been fucked by a midget?"  "No."  "It's hot as hell."  "May I ask a question?"  He smiled, excited that I might ask for more intimate detail about his sexcapades with men of shorter stature.  "Sure."  "Technically, midgets are properly proportioned, but just smaller.  However, dwarves are diminutive, but not in proportion with the exception of their genitals.  Therefore, I would imagine that you probably mean you are turned on by dwarves."  His face contorted like a constipated Cabbage Patch Kid.  "That's sick man!  That's just sick!"  I thought he was going to punch me for a second and then he stomped off.  "Finally," I thought to myself and exhaled with relief.  Now I can't stop thinking about what it would be like to have sex with a midget or a dwarf.

       WHAT DO YOU WISH GUYS WOULD DO MORE OF IN BED?   A friend of mine was recently shocked to learn that I do not own any porn.... specifically gay porn. In turn, I was shocked by his schock.  "What's the big deal?" I asked.    "Are you crazy?" He asked, pulling hair on both sides of his head for dramatic effect.  "Why it's only your goddamn right as a Gay American!"  "Really."  I set my TBB (Tequila Based Beverage) down on the table and turned to give him my full undivided attention.  "I'm intrigued.  Tell me more."  "You need something to focus on."  "This sounds too much like natural childbirth training and I'm not having a baby."  "You need pictures of hot, hung young men to jump start your libido."  "I've already got quite and imagination and I don't necessarily won't to try everything that I imagine.  I mean a hamster is one thing in fantasty, but quite another in execution."  Finally, he leaned over the table.  "A gay man without gay porn is like Batman without a utility belt."  I haven't been able to get that conversation out of my head.  My friends words have rung in my head like the bells that toll for me.  Maybe I do need porn.  Perhaps it's a right of passage long overdue like my first jock straps or knee pads or cleats.  I decided to look up some gay porn magazines online to see what's available.  My friend is very fond of Fresh Men, which does sound good as opposed to Not So Fresh Men.  I visited their website and they have an interesting poll going on: What do you wish guys would do more of in bed?.  Take the poll by clicking  urlLink here .  I learned that 41.6% of men polled want to cuddle and kiss followed by another 25.4% that want men to rim and play with their ass. 13.0% have been boinking Speedy Gonzalez while 9.2% just want some more nipple play, please.  Tied with 5.4% are talking dirty and other.  I've always liked the sound of other. I wonder what it is.  It reminds of something Lily Tomlin once said: "I always wanted to be somebody, but I guess I should have been more specific."

       YOU'D BETTER WORK!   Kellie came over to help print out sponsorship forms and letters for the Mothball. September 25th will be here in no time.  Katy and her daughter, Emma, both had colds so Katy stayed home.  Watching her makes me have respect for mothers with small children.  Children are to be cherished, but they take a lot of time, care and attention.  Kellie brought over a pizza from Wholefoods and it was delicious.  I never would have thought about putting squash on a pizza.  She also made a basalmic vinegar dressing from scratch.  Is there nothing that girl can't do?  We listened to the Moulin Rouge soundtrack since that is the them of the Mothball this year.  Afterwards, we put on Ultimate Dance Party 1997. I mentioned that I had been enjoying VH1 Classic recently and she said, "You know that I was on VH1 once."    "Really?"  "I was on House of Style."  "What were you doing on there?"  "I used to model."  "Oh."  "You don't know, do you?"  "Know what?"  "I used to be a professional model and lived in Milan and Germany.  I worked for Prada."  "You said the 'P' word."  "Yes, I did.  Prada provided a chef to us and he prepared our lunch every day.  It was usually champagne and chocolate."  "So what happened?"  "I got mono and came home to get better.  I realized that if I wanted to be with Steve and spend time with my family, I couldn't pursue modeling so I decided to go back to school."  "You gave modeling to be with Steve?"  "Yes."  We stuffed envelopes in silence for a few moments.  "You must REALLY love Steve."  "Yes," she smiled.  "I do."

       STEPWORD WIVES WASN'T SO BAD   Saturday afternoon I went to catch a matinee of The Stepford Wives.  I wasn't expecting much because it received such horrible reviews, but I wanted to see it anyway because it was one of those movies my mom watched again and again as I was growing up.  Plus, I like Nicole Kidman and Bette Midler.  First, I cannot believe how expensive movies have become.  It's $8.50 for a movie now.  I went to see a matinee and it was $6.50.  When I was a kid we used to walk ten miles through the snow to the theater and only pay $1.75.  Okay.  Now that is out of my system.  The spoof of reality TV shows was great especially the one with the man and the woman competing to answer the questions and the woman hits the buzzer first on the question, "Who is more likely to be turned on by a sexy lesbian?"  The characters are not entirely three-dimensional, but Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick do a nice job. Bette Midler and the guy who plays the gay guy are both great.  I cannot believe that Faith Hill faked an orgasm on screen.    The ending added a new twist to the original, but I'm not sure what the robot on the table was all about.  It did get a little preachy at the end, but overall, it was just good fun.  Definitely worth a matinee or a video rental.

       ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER   On my way back from the gym this evening, I thought about my best friend, Kent, and I found myself overcome with this feeling that I just wanted to spend some time and talk with him very badly.  Trouble is, Kent is dead.  I wasn't overcome with grief, but just a sad longing to drive around singing old Bananarama songs and listen to him do bawdy Katherine Hepburn impression from  On Golden Pond .    "Henry, sometimes I just want to grab your penis and yank it around and around and around."  Or Carol Channing singing  Let's Hear It For The Boy .    We could have fun doing anything and we didn't have to have money.  Kent was also the best person to watch comedy with because he had this epileptic giggle loop that just kept going once he got started.  I've had an idea to adapt a true story for a script and this afternoon I finally felt that the time is right to approach this person about his story.  We'll see what happens.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  It's a phrase that is supposed to be sentimental, but it sounds like a fungus problem if you think about it.

       THE FIRST LINE   I came across a scratch of paper that had the following written on it:  "'I want to die in Mexico City,' she said."  Underneath that I had written the words "snow globe."  I wonder what it all means.  I do like the first sentence.  Wouldn't it make a great first line of a story or novel.  Perhaps we should all do it and y'all can send me your stories.  The winner will receive some gourmet hot sauce.

       CONFLICT RESOLUTION   "Sometimes I feel like you ignore me."  "I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to."  "It makes me feel like you don't care... like I'm not important to you."  "I didn't realize I was doing that.  The next time you feel that I'm ignoring you, please let me know."  "Oh!  So the burden of the responsibility is back on me."  "No.  I'm just saying that if you feel like I ignore you and I don't realize it, how else am I going to become aware of this behavior?"  "If you were really into me, you would know."

       HOLLIS GILLESPIE IS STALKING ME IN MY DREAMS   There's no place to run and no place to hide.  Eventually I will have to go to sleep.  The words I type seem like a familiar cliche from a 50's science fiction movie, but the reality of the situation is that there is a real fear to feed the fires of my paranoia.  Last night,  urlLink Hollis Gillespie  appeared again.  We were in a  urlLink Waffle House  somewhere south of Atlanta on Interstate 85.  Hollis was dressed in a smart ginham pant suit that would have looked at home on a Mary Tyler Moore Show supporting actress; think Valerie Harper or Cloris Leachman.  For some reason I'm feel nervous and the food has not arrived so I can't place the blame there.  It's almost like trying to tell someone you have romantic feelings for them, but I don't know this woman and I'm gay.  Eventually, I just spit it out that I know that she's written a book called  urlLink Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch: Tales From A Bad Neighborhood  and my friend and former neighbor, Katy, knows her.  I also suspect that it was she who came by our neighborhood yard sale and Jeff gave her daughter a Christmas ornament.  It was hard to tell because her tongue wasn't hanging out of her mouth.  However, I don't let my doubt get in the way.  It just feels good to part my biscupids and let it all out.  She appears relieved as well.  Her lower lip is trembling in an anxious way and her eyes are poised on every word I say.  In a good way like someone is finally telling you something that you've always wanted to hear, but still can't believe is true... like you've just won a MTV contest to have Belinda Carlisle headline a barbecue in your backyard with 500 of your most intimate friends.  We lean close to one another and talk maniacally, laughing nervously every minute or so.  We're bonding.  She is frequent commentator on NPR and I'm a frequent....  Well, I don't know that I'm a frequent anything.  It sounds so authoritative, like an expert witness.  Frequent UFO flyer certainly carries more prestige than certified nut and resident of lower Alabama.  I'm just an ordinary man who is meeting a columnist for  urlLink Creative Loafing  in my dreams and I don't know why.  At this point, Jeff's sleep apnea usually kicks in and startles me awake, but once I remember the cows from the Chick-Fil-A advertisements rushing into the Waffle House.  These aren't fun, party-kind of cows looking for some cheap, greasy food after a night out drinking in Buckhead. These are terrorist cows who hurl a rubber chicken onto our table with a ticking bomb inside of it.  Hollis throws herself onto the rubber chicken as I cry out, "No, Hollis!  No!  There isn't a squeegee big enough to get all of the gingham off the walls!"  Then I wake up.  I'm not sure about that last part. They may have been the sour cream chicken enchiladas talking.   I should really read Hollis' book.  I think I would enjoy it.  She lives in or around my neighborhood and she wrote a column once about taking her daughter to daycare at St. Paul's Methodist Church and encountering a naked homeless person with their pastor, Susannah.  It was humorous, but moving.  After reading it, I felt that Hollis, as the writer, and I, as the reader, were both naked too.  I like it when unconventional people who don't fit the mold of what society and the media consider acceptable and marketable make it.  It gives me faith in humanity.  It gives faith that people are not being completely dumbed-down by radio playlists and marketing analysts.  Yes, I should really read that book, but after an e-mail from one of my readers about the magic spot (See "Do You Know Where Your Magic Spot Is?" from Saturday, July 10, 2004,) I had to pull out my copy of "The Multiple Orgasmic Male" and read it again.  It's amazing to rediscover that my body is practically a X-Box of hours of pleasure that can be played with one to two players.  After that, I need to finish a book on the great white shark and the "Life of Phi' that Jeff gave me as well as a novel by another local author.  I'll get to it eventually, but for now, wherever Hollis is, I hope she is safe and loved and not wearing gingham.  Also, keep an eye out for rubber chickens.

       WHEN A FORMER BASEBALL LEGEND CALLS   Hank Aaron keeps calling my house.  This afternoon was the third time and I hung up on him again.  Hank lives in the area and owns a BMW dealership.  He's supporting a local political candidate.  I don't know who because I hung up on him.  I don't like these prerecorded messages of endorsement.  They're a great marketing idea, but I've reached the point where I hate to hear my phone ring.  It's an interruption from whatever I'm doing to run to the den and pick up the phone to stop the obnoxious ring. Yes, I know there is an answering machine, but that just means postponing talking to whomever has called.  Who needs to add another item to their "to do" list?  At least with e-mail spam I can filter it out or delete it.  At the times I have sat down to read e-mail, that is my purpose to be there.  I do not sit down by the phone, ready to take a phone call.  Nor do horny teenage sluts call me up to offer their well-lubed orifices for my pleasure.  They simply appear in my in box, legs in the air and covered with a seminal facial.  I just click "delete as spam" and they are gone from my life. No mess, no worry.

       DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MAGIC SPOT IS?   A friend of mine complained the other day that he and his boyfriend had tried about everything sexually.  He asked if I knew of anything different he and his boyfriend could try.  I suggested that he press his boyfriend's magic spot right before his boyfriend orgasms.  "The what?"  I explained that the magic spot is located almost center between the anus and scrotum along the perenium.  It's a small indention that you can feel.  If you press a finger firmly about inch in, it hits a trigger point that diverts the ejaculation from the uretha directly into the bladder.  In other words, his boyfriend would have the muscle contractions of a typical orgasm, but no semen will spew forth. He asked me how I knew this and I told him I read a lot.  He thought I was joking, but I was serious.  "It's nice alternative," I said.  "You know when you're out on the town and you don't feel like swallowing and there are no Taco Bell napkins in the glove compartment."  My friend looked at me as if I was some sort of pervert and I had to remind him that I wasn't the one into water sports.  In closing, let me qualify my comment by saying that my friend does not know how to water ski.

       HAIRY DETAILS   My bangs were hanging down in my eyes.  It's hot and humid.  I'm too active to have hair this long.  Randy gave me a hybrid cut.  It's not quite a crewcut, but I would look at home on the set of  Black Hawk Down .

       THAT WAS GREAT, BUT THIS TIME, CAN YOU BE A LITTLE MORE MINTY?   Voiceover class was interesting. One of the instructors reminds me of the psychiatrist from Augusten Burroughs' novel, "Running With Scissors."  He looks like everyone's favorite Santa Claus look-a-like who is most likely to molest an altar boy that you know.  He's from Alabama and speaks magnificently.  The other instructor is a former voice talent agent and she played his 60-second demo.  It was amazing. This man has done so many commercials that I have heard on local radio and national TV.  He's the voice of Quick Trip, Ford, Valveline and Jag-u-ar.   The voice talent agent used the term "money shot" and had to explain it to a young girl.  I think I enjoyed that moment too much.  I sometimes think my middle name is diabolical.  Everyone in my class is a serious actor.  Naturally, I feel somewhat out of place.  I'm just taking it for fun really and feel much like a PTA mother who wandered into an A.A. meeting by accident and just feels too embarrassed to leave.  It's like I'm a fauxaholic.  We learned about blending on Wednesday. If you have a word that ends with a hard consonant followed by a word that starts with a vowel, you blend them together.  For instance, the phrase "act of" becomes "ak tov."  It sounds easy enough, but try reading outloud when you have never seen the script before.  The black guy sitting beside me did a fantastic job.  He read with meaning. I meant to do that, but I didn't want to miss a blending opportunity.    I'm supposed to practice for an hour each day, but I've already missed Thursday and Friday.  I'll have to make up for it the rest of the week.  I didn't expect it to be so much work, but I think it will be good for me.  I need to learn to talk correctly.  If all else fails, I'll just go in and pretend that I'm Dawn French or Jennifer Saunders.  "Are you going to use the accent?  "I am using the accent.  Howr uhr yew?"  This may not be pretty.

       THE BAR, THE BEER AND THE BOY   I met a guy at the neighborhood business association and we met for drinks tonight at a local bar.  After I had accepted the invitation, I began to wonder if perhaps he might be gay.  You may think it's a funny question to ask, but I've been rusty the last few years.  As worldy as my life has been, sometimes I can be so naive.  For instance, I recall the lesbian couple that Jeff and I met at the Biltmore Vineyard.  Jeff wasn't so sure they were lesbians.  I told him he was a novice challenging a professional.  I called his attention to how close they were standing next to one another and one girl's short hair.  How was I to know she recently finished chemotherapy?  It's not like she had to wear a sign.  Anyway, I've always been leary of assuming anything.  It's not just my fear of being wrong, but my adversion to gay people who think that the entire world is gay and just itching to come out and service their large, turgid members and manhandle their gargantuan breast-globes.  So I met this guy, who I'll call Trevor because I just feel like it, about 5:30pm at a nice local bar.  He had a pitcher of beer waiting.  Now, I haven't been a big drinker for several years.  It's like one day I just woke and forgot all about alcohol. It's like it was an old sweater. "Hey, here's that old cardigan grandma gave me.  I think I'll have a sip."  Also, I've never been a big beer fan, but I think I drank almost a whole pitcher myself.  Soon, I no longer felt my scalp.  When my eyebrows went numb, I slowed down.   Trevor and I talked for about three hours.  We talked about... well, everything.  He introduced me to several people in the bar.  I met the bartender and his fiance.  Their parents are meeting for the first time tomorrow evening.  A salt of the earth country couple will be meeting an affluent Asian-American family from Roswell tomorrow night.  Let the wine flow.  The rehearsal dinner was going to be at Six Feet Under, but evidently Chinese people cannot have any sort of wedding celebration within sight of a cemetery. It's a bad omen.  No more than the bride walking in on the groom boinking the maid of honor, but who am I to judge?  I wish them the best.  Some of the other people referred to Trevor in a plural so I believe he must have a roommate at the very least.  Ironically, I found myself not talking about Jeff either.  It wasn't because my intentions were dishonorable.  I'm afraid I've just gotten very used to Jeff being very uncomfortable telling anyone about our relationship and not it just seems normal to me.  Moreover, it sort of comes across weird when you announce to someone that you're gay and that you have a boyfriend, whom you're in a monogamous relationship with.  It either comes across as if you're telling someone that you think they're homophobic or they want to have sex with you.  I would have liked to have seen my facial expressions tonight because when I start thinking like this I reach a certain point where I just think to myself, "Jesus, just let it go before you drive yourself INSANE!"  About 9:00pm I excused myself and went to Publix.  I bought some sushi and tiramisu and came back home to watch "Thoroughly Modern Millie" with Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore and Carol Channing.  It was released in 1967, the year I was born, and I like to believe that I would love this movie even if I wasn't gay.  They made it into a Broadway musical several years ago.  I love Mrs. Meers, the Chinese hotel mother, who is secretly kidnapping all the orphan women and selling them into white slavery.  "Shu sho!  Shu sho!"  I also like the elevator that you have to tap dance in to get it to work.  It's just a silly movie.  I've waited to watch it hoping that there might be a time that Jeff and I could watch it together so I could share it with him, but that has been a pipe dream so far.  I finally decided that I wanted to watch it tonight.  I remember watching it once when I was a kid.  It came on again a year later and I talked my sister into watching it.  She laughed and laughed and I remember watching her during the movie and thinking that it was neat that she was sharing this with me.  We didn't really get along much when I was younger.

       HEY, I'VE BEEN BUSY   Tomorrow I must wake up early and clean the house.  Jeff is coming home tomorrow night from Central America.  The house is not in disorder, I just need to freshen it up a bit so it looks like I made the effort to spruce it up for his homecoming.  Well, I'm not going to just make it look like that; I am doing that.    It's been a busy week with voiceover class, Mothball meetings, taking loan applications in the evening, working on Jim's website.  (Have you noticed that I have begun spelling website as one word with a lower case "W".  That's the way Macromedia spells it. However, I once lost points on a paper because my instructor said that Web site is referring to the World Wide Web and should be capitalized.  It's hard to let that go, but I need to move beyond it and forgive the bitch.  I'm such a loving person.)  It's always interesting how all of Jefffifer's mutual friends call when Jeff leaves for this trip once a year.  "How long will Jeff be gone?"  "A week."  "Are you okay?"  "Yeah.  Why do you ask?  Did his plane go down?"  "No, but.... you know."  I would find it hard to believe that anyone who knows me would think that I would be a tramp while Jeff is away.  Maybe they just think that I'm helpless without him.  I wish I could say that I had eaten pizza and rented videos, but I have not.  I've cleaned my bedroom and gone through my books.  I've organized my desk and files.  I haven't even looked at gay porn on the Internet.  Do I get points counted off for that?  Jeff is going to ask me if I missed him and to tell you the truth, I have been so preoccupied with so many things that need to be done that the week has flown by.  I'm conscious that he's gone and I think about things I want to tell him when he gets back, but I'm not like a devoted lab staring morbidly at the door until he returns.  A few years ago that might have bothered me, but I've grown up a lot.  Although I never expected a relationship to be easy, I've been surprised how much the intimacy of companionship soon overtakes lust.  Maybe lesbian death bed is not such a bad thing.  Maybe we've just been fooled into thinking that romance, sex and passion is everything like we once believed that low-carb diets are our only salvation.  In some parts of the world, arranged marriages are still the norm and love is never really considered.  Tomorrow night he'll arrive at the airport and I will pick him up.  He'll be dirty and tell me he missed and about all the experiences he had down there.  After we arrive home, he'll shower and then he will quickly pass out from exhaustion.  I'll brush his hair back off his face and watch him sleep for a few moments.  I'll read for a while and then I'll turn out the light.  I'll hear his sleep apnea sputtering like machine gun fire in the darkness beside me and smile.  I'm glad to have him home.

       I'M BEING TRADED   My friend, Mark, sent me this  urlLink link  today.  Cult of Jef is listed on the Top 100 Incoming Links at #8 and #13.  I have no idea what it means.  According to the website:   BlogShares is a simulated, fantasy stock market for weblogs where players invest fictional money to buy stocks and bonds in an artificial economy where attention is the commodity and weblogs are the companies. Weblogs, or blogs for short, are valued by their incoming links from other known blogs. In effect, links become the business deals in the simulation and players speculate on the fortunes of thousands of blogs by buying and selling shares. A whole host of options exist for advanced play including gifting shares, leveraged buy-outs, stock splits, additional share issues, market and player bonds. For full details see the Help Center.   Anyone can play BlogShares for free, and ownership of a blog is not a requirement to participate. You need simply to register to receive a virtual $500 to start investing. Blog owners also receive 1000 shares of stock in their blog. Each individual uses the simulation for different purposes: you can use BlogShares to find new blogs to read, to show your appreciation by buying or gifting shares and, of course, to accrue as much capital as possible. Advanced options such as bonds allow you to take the game in a number of different directions.   With over 5,000 active players at the end of the Beta phase and more than 40,000 known blogs, BlogShares provides a rich, complex environment for (virtual) profit and fun. BlogShares continues to expand as more members, more blogs and more features are added to this quickly growing online community.    Interesting.

       JEF'S GOT A BIG ONE!   Four or five times a year I give a seven minute presentation at my PowerCore meeting about some aspect of my business.  For the past month I have been discussing the interest only LIBOR Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) and I decided to end my series with my seven minute presentation.  Being that talking about one's business is rather dry, I decided to liven it up a little with a good analogy.  I decided that since an ARM does involve some risk since it's not a fixed for the life of the loan, it's sort of like a wild animal.  For the most part it's predictable, but if you choose an ARM for the wrong reasons, it can come back to bite you.  My goal was to explain which customers and circumstances are best for this product.  I decided that it reminded me of  Mutual Omaha's Wild Kingdom  except no one is wearing khakis, shooting tranquilizer darts or measuring the loan amount and saying, "Looks like Jef's got a big one!"  The analogy went over well, but the seven minutes seemed rather dry.  I had a few jokes here or there, but it's not the subject matter that consistently results in laughter or tears.  I had decided it was a good first experience to learn from and vowed to do better next time.  However, after the meeting several people came up to me and asked questions about the product or told me they had that product and loved it.  I also received three leads today.  I guess I did better than I thought.

       I HEART JOHN EDWARDS   Truth be told, I always preferred Howard Dean and John Edwards to John Kerry.  I'm still not gung ho on Kerry, but Edwards sounds promising.  Of course, I have a lot of research to do before I make my final decision.  I've noticed over the past decade or so that as Americans, we are generally a lazy lot when it comes to politics.  We tend to ask the opinions of our friends and co-workers and accept these views and choices as our own.  We hear something about Bush on TV or the radio and accept it as Gospel truth instead of putting out the effort to find out the facts.  Now, I'm not a Bush supporter, but I don't belive in bashing the man just because I'm gay and he's supporting a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage.  Likewise, I tire at hearing comments made about Kerry that are completely subjective.  I still maintain my belief that we would be better off without political parties.  With each passing year it resembles the alliances between two people on  Survivor  so they can vote someone else off the island.  Unless you have been under a rock, you know that Michael Moore released his documentary,  Fairenheit 911 .  Never before has anyone used a documentary to sway public opinion about an imcumbant president prior to an election.  It's an interesting concept.  Several people have told me it's a powerful film and I must see it.  However, when I have asked them what was powerful about it, no one seems to give me any details.  On the flip side, I read editorials about the movie by Republicans who basically said that Moore is the anti-Christ and a liar.  They told me that to believe the lies in that so called documentary would prove that I'm unpatriotic.  As I skimmed through the text I discovered no specific details included in the film that were rebutted with facts.  They didn't have to see the movie; they knew it was all propaganda.  We are coming up on the biggest election our country has ever seen and we have two political parties that are pointing fingers at each other and saying the other one started it.    Never before has it been more important for each of us to read all the information available about all the candidates who are running for the office of the President.  We need to be careful to dismiss any information we are given that is unsupported by fact, but is based on opinion.  We have to learn to think for ourselves. It's not easy.  It's work, but if we give in to taking the easy way out by voting for whom our friends are voting for, we are basically dishonoring everyone who has died in the last 200+ years of country to give us the right to vote.  There is no reason that any of us should not vote.  Don't tell me you're neutral.  If you are, go to Switzerland.  If we choose to become lazy we allow our democracy to fall apart.  Now, I have to admit that out of the President/Vice President combos that are running, I would most like to perform oral sex on John Edwards, but I am going to stretch myself beyond such fantasies to research and analyze whether Kerry and Edwards should be in the White House just because Edwards has a humongous member.  How do I know this?  I read it in chat room, therefore, it has to be true.

       HIS NAKED TRUTH ABOUT FLIP FLOPS   I've never been a big fan of the little plastic sandals commonly referred to as flip flops.  However, I did finally break down and buy a pear this summer as I returned to the pool.  They are red and blue and manufactured by Speedo.  After banging my toe on the side of my bed the other day, they also came in useful when it was difficult to wear other shoes.  I mentioned this to someone I know as I looked down at the still black and blue toe on my right foot.  "I think there sexy as hell."  "Really?" I asked, turning around to look at him, tilting my head to the side to imply interest.  "Hell, yeah.  My favorite thing to do is to walk around the house naked, wearing nothing but my flip flops."  "Is it for religious purposes?"  "No.  I just like the feel of it."  "The feel of it?"  "Yeah.  I like to look at myself in the mirror.  I like the way I look wearing nothing but flip flops."  "I would imagine it is very revealing."  "I like the way my dick hangs between my legs, pointing straight down at my flip flops."  "It doesn't sound very stimulating."  "It's mathematical."  "I beg your pardon."  "You know that implied triangle that you see in all of DaVinci's artwork.  That's what I see between my dick and my flip flops... an implied triangle.  It makes me feel powerful... sexy."  "I'm afraid I have no response to that."  "Of course the best feeling is when you walk out of the shower and your balls are hanging down to your knees."  "I really didn't need to know that."  "It makes me wish that I had a beard that reached down to my feet.  I bet it would feel good tickling my-  At this point I put my hands over my ears and began singing, "La, la, la, la, la, la, la...."

       PROJECT RED, WHITE AND BLUE   The Internet has really been harnessed for so many useful things.  For example, there is an online petition to have Warner Brothers include Lynda Carter, the former TV Wonder Woman, in the Wonder Woman movie.  It's called Project Red, White And Blue.  They really should at least give her a cameo.  The woman has devoted a good portion of her life promoting the character and has done a very nice job of it.  Warner Brothers should really honor her in this small way.  If you would like to sign the petition, click  urlLink here .

       V.O. STANDS FOR VOICEOVER   Image Film & Video is holding an eight-week class called Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Voiceover....   Interested in fine-tuning your speaking skills for commercial or voiceover work? Imagine developing and strengthening your own vocal power with two instructors covering both the business and the talent aspect of voiceover work. Co-taught by Sally Neal (former voiceover department head for People Store) and Stuart Culpepper (veteran of stage, film, television and radio), this class will combine acting, critical analysis, and business savvy in order to turn your interests into a possible vocal career. With Stuart, you'll record, listen to, and receive constructive feedback from the class and the instructor on in-class vocal exercises. With Sally, you'll learn the business side of things, including how to get a demo together, approaching an agent and knowing what to expect, union/non-union recording rates, and how to market yourself if all else fails. Eight Wednesdays, July 7-August 25, 2004. 7pm-9pm. Registration deadline: Tuesday, July 6. Limited to 12 students. Students must bring a battery-operated tape recorder and two hours worth of tape to class for individualized recording exercises.   All of my adult life people have told me that I have a nice speaking voice or radio voice, but I've never done anything with it.  At the Perfect Pitch contest, one of the panelists mentioned that he had become distracted from what I was saying by listening to my voice.  I've always been interested in doing voiceover work, but gave up on the idea when I auditioned for the Georgia Reading Network and was turned down for reading to the blind.    I'm feeling adventurous.  I think I'll do it!

       GHETTO ENVY   "Say it," I said.  Joan giggled.  We were sitting at Arby's after church.  "Say it."  "Why?'  "It makes me laugh."  "Why?"  "It just sounds funny when you say it.  C'mon, say it."  Joan put down her sandwich and leaned across the table. "Black folk."  I laughed hysterically.  Joan began referring to African-Americans as black folk a few years ago when she began spending time with our friend, Ray. Joan began to embrace so many things African-American.  Ray accused her of having ghetto envy.  I just enjoy the way Joan says black folk.  It's something in the way she massages the sounds with her mouth.  It just fills me with delight and makes joy burst out of my mouth.  Wouldn't it be great if everyone felt such joy about black folk?  I have to believe that one day we will finally grow and move beyond all of our prejudices.

       DRINKING A FIFTH ON THE FOURTH   Mark told me to meet him at Paul's condo about 5:45pm.  We were going over to Doug's condo for a barbecue.  As I drove across town, I wondered if Doug knew I was coming along.  I hate to crash parties uninvited, unless of course Bananarama is there and then you just need to get out of my way.  I'm sorry, but I'm there number one fan.  Paul seemed a bit surprised to see me.  I mentally replayed changing clothes at my house just to check that I had not actually put on a French maid's outfit or my WWJD thong.  These of course would explain a quizical stare.  "Am I early?" I asked.  "Not now," Paul replied slyly, "But fifteen minutes earlier and you would have."  Mark and Steve arrived a few minutes later.  We went to Publix to pick up a few thigns to take over.  I learned that we had missed the party for the most part and we were taking things over to have an after party.  I was directed to bring a platter of patriotic cookies and some Arizona iced tea with lemon flavor.    Doug greeted us warmly and I met his girlfriend, Rachel, whom Paul led me to believe was a coatcheck girl, but is actually a court clerk.  We had a spirited discussion about the legalities of ripping music from CD's and then making copies for friends and/or selling them to used CD stores.  It is always interesting to watch Paul debate someone whom can hold his own with him.  He has such a delightful look on his face when he meets someone who can almost be his equal.  I ate way too many cookies. I must have been hungrier than I thought.  The icing turned my tongue blue and I looked as if I had just rimmed Nightcrawler from the X-Men.  Doug insisted that I eat a patriotic cupcake, which I did.  That combined with with the Doritos and ice tea almost sent me into a sugar coma.  I trised sushi and watched Southpark for the first time.  I guess this virgin can't be thrown into the volcano anymore.  Doug is obsessed with soccer and shared his World Cup CD's with us.  He has to be one of my all time favorite straight people to observe.  He is a bundle of energy and thoughts.  He's not a big ball of masculine bravado, pretending to be something he's not.  He has managed to retain the enthusiasm of a little boy and channel into a myriad of interests that range from public policy to unusual toys from the eighties.  Rachel complements him well.  She is very intelligent and earthy - two of my favorite qualities.  I also have to admire her for almost as eating as many cookies as I did.  We had an interesting conversation about the differences of being born Catholic as opposed to being born Jewish.  I feel that it's easier to decide to choose to not be Catholic as opposed to choose to not be Jewish if you were born into either religion.  Although they both utilize guilt very effectively, I think Jewish culture is more entwined in the psyche than Catholicism.  After all, Jews have historically descended from the tribes of Israel and we discussed how they were consdidered their own race by the Nazis.    We also discussed how easy it is for the gay community to slide back and loose social acceptance.  After all, look at how open and accepted gay culture was in Germany prior to Hitler's rise to power.  None of us felt that there is anyway that the Georgia Constitutional Amendment against gay marriage will be stopped.  Even though 2/5 of Georgia lives in the Atlanta area, the other 3/5 will vote for it.  Written so broadly, it's bound to effect domestic partnership benefits for both same sex couples and opposite sex couples.  I questioned what would happen if you had a couple where partner B obtained medical benefits through partner A's company and then wad diagnosed with a serious illness.  If the new law means that the company can no longer insure partner B even if they want to, what happens to partner B's medical treatment once the benefits are gone?  Partner B cannot apply with another insurance company because partner B now has a pre-existing medical condition.  We left about 11:30pm and I was surprised we had stayed so long.  I had a great time when I had seriously thought about just staying home earlier.  I was able to spend time with my peeps (Paul, Andrew, Mark and Steve), get to know Doug a little bit better and find a new friend, Rachel.

       KABBALAH THIS!   Joan gave me an interview with Madonna that was in Oprah magazine to read.  As usual, Madonna waxed on about the Kabbalah and I was surprised to hear how much it sounded like Unity where I go to church.  Now most people will tell you that Kabbalah is not a religion, but a path.  Unity has been called the same.  I found myself wanting to know more.  I did a little research on-line, but never found anything I liked so I looked up several books on the Internet and decided to check them out at Borders today.  Unfortunately, I never found any that I liked.  I have a book on Kabbalah somewhere, but I seem to remember that I couldn't get into it.  I have studied the Tree of Life before.  I've recently begun practicing yoga again and I'm listening to Madonna a lot.  Am I becoming Madonna... or Mandonna?  I admire her for her drive.  I guess I'll have to see what happens as I continue with yoga and if I explore Kabbalah in more detail.

       CONVERSATIONS WITH JOAN   Yesterday was a lazy day.  I came home after taking Jeff to the airport and went back to bed.  I woke up about 10:30am, which might as well have been 4:00pm my time.  I never sleep that late.  I took it easy around the house and then Joan came by to pick me up and went out to dinner at Nuevo Laredo for her birthday.  Nuevo Laredo is a Mexican restaurant that is out in the industrial district beyond Chatahoochie Boulevard.  There is always a wait so we went early.  Fortunately, we only had to wait about five minutes.  We ordered chicken chimechangas and drank margaritas and Dr. Pepper.  As I was admiring some art on the wall, I asked, "Why can't angels be allowed to drink beer if they want to?"  Joan looked at the artwork and said, "That's not a beer bottle.  That's a bugle."  "You see your reality," I said.  "I see mine."  Afterwards, we went to Tower Records and Joan read magazines about Janet Jackson while I looked at exercise magazines that told me how to lose my body fat.  Somehow, I don't think I can outrun it.  I flirted with the idea of buying a pornographic magazine while Jeff was away.  "What kind would you get?" Joan asked.  "Oh, you know... something with a smooth, pretty boy who shaves his asshole.  The usual."  We decided to go to Jake's for ice cream. I ordered Devyn's Animal Crackers and Chocolate Pecan Pie Scream and Joan had Slap Yo Mama Chocolate and Strawberry Cheesecake, I believe. We went upstairs and ate our ice scream while Joan discussed some things in her life that she wants to work on and achieve before her next birthday.  A boy and girl came upstairs and stood in the doorway.  He mentioned every piece of furniture in the room, but ignored us. I began moving like one of the animatronic presidents at Disneyworld and began saying, "Four score and seven years ago...."  We finished the evening off at my house.  We were going to watch The Dame Edna Experience, but Joan decided that she wanted to make a treasure map, which is a visual representation of something you want to manifest in your life.  She cut several words and pictures out of magazines and glued them onto some colored paper while I made an inventory of my mid-year goals.  It was very helpful and I feel much clearer now about what I want to accomplish before the year's end.  Finally, we both realized we were tired.  She went home and I went to bed.  It was a nice evening.

       THE ROAD TO CENTRAL AMERICA   As many of you may know, 2F's is now in Central America on a missionary trip.  He has gone every summer for the last four years.  The first year it was hard because we were just three years into our relationship and had only been living together for a few months.  The second year was easier.  Last year I dropped his fuzzy butt off at the airport and went to buy the new Harry Potter book and went home to read it over a chicken buiscitt.  Tim and I drove up to Helen, Georgia that afternoon and had lunch.  I enjoyed having the house to myself.  Buddy and I ordered a pizza and watched movies together.  Toward the end of the week, I missed him and was glad to see him return.  I think relationships grow the most when you're apart.  Jeff was packed early this year and we managed to get into bed before 11:00pm.  As we were attempting to go to sleep, a huge fireworks display began at Turner Field.  We could see them from the window and the sound was loud.  It sounded like we were in a combat zone.  After twenty minutes, I got up and came down stairs to finish laundry.  We got up shortly before four and I drove him to the airport.  He seemed very concerned to be separated from me for this week. I certainly don't believe that he thinks I'm going to misbehave in his absence, but I wonder what he wanted me to do or say to make him feel better.  After four years, I've sort of gotten used to his absence for a week.  He enjoys going and I support him in doing so.  Plus, we're in the phase of our relationship where we've been together long enough that we're not chasing each other around the furniture anymore.  Well, we never really did, but we're at the stage where our relationship is based more on friendship and companionshihp than it is on urgent physical intimacy.  We both have goals we are working on right now and we're both pretty focused on those goals.  I've realized that in focusing on our goals so much, we really don't make a lot of time for each other anymore.  Granted, eat dinner together each evening and talk several times a day, but we don't spend a lot of time together where we are just focusing on each other.  We don't ever make out on the couch anymore while listening to the Saturday night jazz program on Public Radio.  I've realized that he is so fixated on opening the book store that there are times where I feel I must write a title on my spine to get his attention. I think I'll plan some things for when he returns.  On the way to the airport, he expressed his concern about our communication skills.  It was a dire prognosis.  The way he talks, you would think we are Israel and Palestine.  I've talked with other couples I know and they have confirmed that even the best couples don't always communicate one hundred percent of the time.  For example, while he was gone on Friday, a woman came by and dropped an enevelope off for Jeff to give to her son when he went to Central America.  I didn't think that Jeff would be back before I left so I put the package on the bed upstairs with the other stuff he laid out to pack.  When I returned home later, he said that he had been waiting around all afternoon for this woman to come by.  I told him that she had and I had placed the package upstairs.  He then proceeded to tell me that I should have told him.  Now, he wasn't here.  He doesn't keep his cell phone on unless he is expecting a call and I can leave notes for him that will never be read no matter where I place them.  I told him that leaving the package by his dufflebag seemed like the most obvious choice since he told me he would be packing this afternoon.  He didn't see it even though it was right on top of the bed where he had laid papers down on top of it.  Then he wanted to know where the been jerky was and I said I didn't know.  The woman handed me the envelope and give it to him and I did.  Jeff then launched into the communication lecture about how I need to do a better job of communicating with him or else the earth is going to spin off its axis and fly into the sun.    Now, I'm not perfect, but I refuse to believe that I have almost made it to the ripe old age of thirty-seven and have managed to communicate effectively with most of the people in the world.  Until I learn to read minds, I'm just going to have to do the best I can.

       BIG BUSINESS   Things have really exploded this week with work.  I've had one client come back from the dead and two new clients referred by one of my realtor partners.  Carol Lynn said that it would be happening soon and now it is.  After months of marketing and struggling to some degree, I'm beginning to see results.  I have the potential of having seven loans in my pipeline this month.  I'm excited to be busy doing loans instead of marketing and actually having the opportunity to help people.  Someone asked me the other day if I still enjoyed my job.  I thought about it for a moment and I said, "Yes."  I like helping people.  I like having clients that may have some part of their application that is not perfect and finding a solution that works for them.  I also enjoy getting paid.  I can work all I want, but if I don't turn in loans that close, I don't get paid.  I'm feeling more confident these days in my ability.    One of my realtor partners called Saturday morning and asked for a good prequalification letter becaue he was having some trouble from the other realtor.  As I was faxing the letter, the other realtor called and it was actually a realtor I knew.  Andrew had actually asked me to work with him in February when his loan officer was leaving the industry to take another job.  Unfortunately, the job fell through and Andrew remained with his loan officer.  However, I admire loyalty.  Andrew asked me about the borrowers and I told him they were great and they would have not problem paying the mortgage on their current house as well as the new house while waiting for the old house to sell.  This relieved Andrew and kept the deal from falling through.  There are 20,000 realtors in the Atlanta area.  What are the chances that I would know the other realtor?  Sometimes I have the feeling that God is winking at me.  This was one of those moments.

       CHECK YER HEAD!   I actually had the opportunity to visit a few blogs today and Beastmomma presented an interested idea of stating what areas of our lives are we looking at in this moment.  Here's what came to mind:  Mortgage Business - My business is beginning to expand and I'm hitting the goals that I have set for myself.  I've noticed that areas of my work that I used to be uncomfortable with in the past are now comfortable and my confidence has increased as well.  Whenever it occurs to me that I need another loan for my pipeline, I relax and let go of the thought instead of worrying about it.  I have actually had a new client call me within five minutes of doing this.  My Relationship - I'm looking at the communication between my partner and myself and see room for improvement.  I'm also becoming aware that we have grown as far as we can in some areas and that we need to reevaluate some things and make modifications to move forward.  It's nothing negative or pessimistic.  Every realtionship is a dance with constant modifications.  Such a process would have scared me in the past, but I have become very comfortable with change. I feel that universal intelligence is always at hand and will guide me if I remain calm.    Writing - I have been astounded to discover how much I enjoy writing, but feel that I have not had much time to do so. My goal is to write every day for at least thirty minutes.  If I choose to write longer after thirty minutes, I can.  I am giving myself permission to try different writing styles and formats.  It's okay for me to embrace the essay and lesbian fiction.  Thunderbirds are go!  My Environment - My bedroom and desk are a mess.  Anyone who knows me can tell you this is unnatural.  However, in an attempt to organize and simplify my life, I have pulled things out of closets and stacked them in my bedroom until I figure out where to put them.  In a way it seems to be symbolic of some of the things I am outgrowing in my relationship and is a visual cue that I need to find a new way to interact with my partner to have my needs met and to meet his.  I'm in love with a minimalist design philosphy and I loan to have more negative space in my room.  My eyes need to rest on open spaces.  Fitness/Nutrition - I've felt a need to let go of the low-carb thing for the time being and just eat normally, but in moderation.  I got off track for a week when I was ill and eating some junk food left me feeling blah.  I've become bored with running again, but started walking five miles three or four times a week.  I've also started swimming again.  I love learning to make my body more streamline by changing its shape in the water and seeing how that affects how quickly I move with the least amount of effort.    Observation - I'm paying more attention to my thoughts and feelings and allowing myself to explore them without jugment or fear.  I'm suddenly the "What If Boy!"

       BUDDING ROMANCE KNEW NO BARRIER   It's stories like this one that give me hope about people.  I came across this article in last Sunday's  urlLink AJC  about a young Carrollton hemophiliac who wanted a girlfriend, but was challenged by his HIV status.  It was such a beautiful story that I'm tempted to turn it into a screenplay.   urlLink Truth trumps HIV in affair of the heart    A hemophiliac infected as a child, Jay Minish spent his teen years and early 20s fearing love was forever off-limits. But he refused to give up his quest. Helena Oliviero - Staff Sunday, June 27, 2004  A chubby-faced Jay Minish pushed the microphone away after his 30-minute speech about living with the virus that causes AIDS.   "Do you have a girlfriend?" a female student asked.   "Not right now, but I hope to have one real soon," Jay said, flashing his signature grin.   "Are you a virgin?" a sweet-looking blonde asked.   Some of the teenagers burst into nervous giggles. An adult moderator at the Alpharetta high school told Jay he didn't have to answer.   But Jay beamed. He liked the question. It went to the core of his struggle as a twentysomething who worried about spending his life alone.   "God, Almighty. That's probably the best question I ever got," he said, blushing. His palms got sweaty.   He brought the microphone close and said, "Yes, I am a virgin."   Born a hemophiliac, Jay was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus as a child while being treated for the inherited blood disorder. Struggling with both illnesses, he lived his life walking a thin wire. A simple fall could provoke uncontrollable bleeding. A mix-up in HIV medication could be deadly.   But he didn't stop living because he was afraid of dying. Jay, a native of Carrollton, traveled across Georgia and spoke to tens of thousands of students as an AID Atlanta speaker. He called his speeches "therapy."   Dressed in Tommy Hilfiger jeans, he blended with his peers. He enjoyed the benefits of young adulthood: independence, close friends and his own car, a canary yellow Dodge Neon.   But what gnawed at him was what he wanted above everything else: romance.   He was part of the first generation of children to survive HIV into adulthood, because of advances in medication. But surviving posed a new set of challenges. Although these children did not contract HIV through sex, they have a disease usually associated with physical intimacy. And that dichotomy made the simple hope of finding true love seem out of reach.   "The hardest part of living with HIV is not having a girlfriend," Jay said.   Walking away   Every Wednesday night over pitchers of Bud Light and a basket of fries, Jay, 24, played trivia with friends at Los Locos in Carrollton.   He reveled in the games and the opportunity to meet women. They flocked to him, a well-mannered young man who wore pressed khakis and a crisp white cotton shirt to bars. He smelled fresh, like Zest.   But when they learned he was HIV-positive, they walked away.   "It happens all the time," said his friend Gena Willard. "A woman will walk up to me and say, 'Jay is so great.' But after a date or two, the woman disappears. She doesn't return his calls or says, 'Let's just be friends.' "   On a night last December, a twentysomething blonde flirted during trivia. He smiled back, but brushed her off.   "I just am not up to it tonight," Jay said as he returned to his seat.   He sat next to his buddy John Olsen. Olsen whistled at his girlfriend, Sarah Muller, to get a kiss. Muller kissed her boyfriend once on the lips, twice on the cheeks.   Jay looked away.   But he knew love was possible.   Three years ago, a nursing student chased him across a parking lot to give him her phone number. He called her a couple of days later, and they laughed through their first date over cheese grits at a Waffle House.   But the woman's mother began to fear the virus, and fear him, according to Jay. After two months, he sat with the woman and her mother at their kitchen table. The mother thought the relationship was too dangerous. She begged the couple to separate.   Jay wept in his car and headed home.   Staying positive   Jay's parents always focused on the positive.   Shortly after he learned of his HIV status in the seventh grade, his parents pulled him off the community swim team after several parents complained. Jay's father, Dan Minish, found another way for his son to swim. As a middle schooler, Jay and his father attended Camp Sunburst, a California summer camp for HIV-infected children.   Jay's parents encouraged their only son to play pingpong and manage the high school basketball team. They indulged him with rare baseball cards, beach vacations and fishing excursions. Though divorced, they regularly sat together with him at Braves games.   Jay and his father, a former sports information director at the State University of West Georgia, developed a spirited college rivalry. Jay rooted for the University of Georgia, his father for Georgia Tech. Jay's mother whipped up his favorite snack --- deviled eggs --- anytime he asked.   "I never let myself get down because I surround myself by so many positive people --- my friends and family," Jay said. "My dad has a way of always making me laugh."   But when it came to girls, his parents --- united in concern for their son --- were at a loss.   His mother, Terri Todd, knew he was lonely, but what could she possibly say? His father wept openly at the thought. While rejection by girls is a natural part of growing up, Jay never seemed to get a fair shot.   But he was upbeat and thoughtful and had lots of friends. He regularly taped a wrestling show for a friend who worked nights. He obtained a $500 loan last year to help pay for Christmas gifts for his "extended family."   At Applebee's, where he worked as a waiter, he danced in the kitchen to make his co-workers chuckle.   Even Jay's doctors sympathized.   "How are things in the girl department?" Dr. James Steinberg asked during one of Jay's routine visits to Emory University Hospital.   "Nothing new there," he replied, head bowed.   Steinberg asked whether Jay had checked into online dating sites for HIV-positive singles.   "Yeah, I looked at it once, but it didn't feel right," he said.   "Well, we'd be happy to talk to her if it happens," Steinberg said. "And your fan club here" --- pointing to a colleague, Dr. Shanta Zimmer --- "can also give a thumbs up or down."   Jay laughed.   "OK, OK," he said. "I'll let you know if anything turns up."   'The Speech'   Suzanne Brons, a 23-year-old waitress, first eyed Jay while eating at the Applebee's where he worked.   Those engaging green eyes. His wide smile.   They made eye contact. Jay introduced himself. Suzanne loved his gentle voice. He seemed polite.   Suzanne begged her friend Georgia Richards, who also worked at the restaurant, to pass along her number. Richards said she would, but told her that Jay would need to share a secret before "anything happens."   Later that week, Suzanne saw Jay again at the Mansion, an upscale Carrollton restaurant where she worked.   Someone pointed in Jay's direction and whispered, "You see him? He has HIV."   Suzanne wanted to hear it from Jay. She smiled at him and later approached him. He wanted to buy her a drink.   "I can buy my own drinks, thank you very much," she said.   A few days later, Jay and Suzanne had a date. They met at Jay's one-bedroom apartment in Carrollton to watch the movie "Dumb and Dumberer."   But before Jay slid the video into the player, he turned to Suzanne and gave "the Speech."   "There's something I need to tell you," he said.   He told Suzanne that he was born with hemophilia, a rare disorder in which a person's blood does not clot normally. Sometime during the early 1980s, he was injected with a treatment that was contaminated with HIV. He was diagnosed when he was about 8, but his parents waited a few years before telling him about it.   With his hands clasped on his lap, he said flatly, "This is the part when most girls leave."   Suzanne, a petite blonde with turquoise-colored eyes, did not. She'd dated a legion of losers, men who blew her off, men who were untrustworthy.   "Well, I am not going anywhere," she said.   Jay started the movie. Suzanne slipped her hand into Jay's. As the movie went on, they leaned into each other. They laughed.   Afterward, Suzanne slept in Jay's bed. They held each other tightly. In the middle of the night, Jay awoke and pulled Suzanne's arm around his waist. He had craved a woman's touch. He wanted to be sure she was still there.   For the next three weeks, Suzanne and Jay slept in the same bed every night. They had, according to Suzanne, "a full and complete relationship."   "I think it's safer to be with someone and to know what they have and take precautions instead of being with someone and not knowing," Suzanne said.   They saw each other during work breaks and text-messaged each other with their cellphones.   Jay was romantic. Once he surprised Suzanne with a single red rose, another time with a takeout dinner of country-fried steak and mashed potatoes. He visited four music stores to find a Jimi Hendrix movie after she said she liked his music.   He shared his hope of someday having a son to name after his father.   He sent her a stream of text messages.   I think it is going to work out between us   Home safely? Just making sure   Listen with your heart. Not your mind   Sweet dreams   'I love you'   On May 15, a Saturday, Jay celebrated his buddy Greg Waldrop's upcoming wedding over beers and conversation. Suzanne was working across town, but his friends knew about her. He seemed to have found the real thing.   Celebrating, Jay was tipsy. At some point during the party, he fell down. Falls and bumps can be quite serious for hemophiliacs, but he got right back up.   "Are you OK?" Waldrop asked.   "I am perfectly fine," Jay said.   Jay slept over at Waldrop's and went home Sunday.   By Monday, Suzanne knew something was wrong, but she thought maybe it was that Jay was ignoring her.   "Jay did not blow people off," she said. "But I am insecure."   On Tuesday afternoon, another friend, Steven Cook, swung by Jay's apartment to maybe watch a game. Jay's Dodge Neon was in the parking lot. Cook knocked on the front door. It was slightly ajar, and swung open.   He heard a box fan in Jay's bedroom, but his friend wasn't there. He turned toward the front door to leave, when he noticed a light in the bathroom.   Jay was lying on the bathroom floor with spots of dried blood around his nose and mouth. He was alive, but barely.   Cook called 911. An ambulance rushed Jay to the emergency department at Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton.   Within minutes, a friend notified Suzanne that Jay was in the hospital.   Upon arrival, Suzanne saw Jay's father and stepmother, Cindy, waiting outside the emergency department. Still in her waitress uniform, Suzanne halted at the doors.   She felt close to Jay, but she had known him less than a month. She wasn't sure she should interfere.   Within a couple of hours, more than 100 people --- high school friends, customers from Applebee's, buddies, co-workers and Suzanne --- stood outside the hospital, forming a circle and praying for Jay.   There was still hope: Jay had swallowed twice and had moved his body slightly. At nightfall, he was transferred to Atlanta Medical Center.   Suzanne tapped out a message on her cellphone while she was on her way to downtown Atlanta.   I know you will get through this. I care for you. I love you.   At the Atlanta hospital, Suzanne walked into Jay's room. As a handful of friends and family members parted to make room for her, she leaned down and gently placed her arms against Jay's body. She sobbed.   Jay had suffered a massive stroke, probably caused by a brain hemorrhage and complicated by his hemophilia. Doctors said it might have been from the fall, or it might have been spontaneous bleeding, common among hemophiliacs.   Jay's family, one close friend and Suzanne held hands and encircled Jay. They recited the Lord's Prayer. Then Jay was taken off life support.   Suzanne knew the relationship was in its early stages. Jay had never met her family. But she mourns a sweet and brief courtship that might have led to something special.   "I have a different kind of hurt," she said. "My hurt is because of the excitement I had. And because I was really looking forward to our relationship."   Epilogue   About a week after Jay's death, his father opened his son's apartment to friends and asked them to take home anything they wanted as a keepsake.   Suzanne fumbled through his closet until she found the blue oxford shirt he wore during their first date. She also picked up the slip of paper with her phone number that he kept on his bedside table.   And while cleaning Jay's car, his father found a note from a teenager, written after one of his speeches:   "Don't worry, you will find someone for you someday

       WONDER WOMAN BLUES   I've been very busy with new business lately and I feel like I haven't had time to read my regular blogs.  It seems as if everyone else is experiencing the same thing because it feels like traffic and comments are quiet.  I enjoyed reading about Jesse's adventures in San Francisco and Ryan's road trip to his new home in San Diego. I've also enjoyed checking in one of my frequent readers from Malaysia and of course Mick down in Australia.  Unfortunately, I haven't had much time to comment.  I've had two loans that I just submitted that required some extra work to gather all documents that the underwriter might ask for to ensure that it goes through smoothly.  I'm not trying to put anything through that is suspicious, but a good loan officer thinks of anything that an underwriter could think of to halt progress or deny a loan.  I received a new lead and had planned to meet with this client tonight to complete the loan application and disclosures, but a friend advised her to check Bankrate.com and of course they are advertising rates that are almost a point lower than I quoted her.  We've established a good rapport and she asked me to research it.  Well, it was quite interesting to find that when I compare my Annual Percentage Rate (APR) to Bankrate.com's APR, it is more than a a half a point higher than mine, which includes one point of origination.  This means that are adding a lot of junk fees and probably a mortgage broker fee to make their money on the back end.  Well, when you average these additional fees into the life of the loan, it results in a higher APR so their customer will really have a higher interest rate.  I hate that.  That take advantage of people and make me look bad.  My client's birthday is tomorrow so I'll have  a nice surprise for her.  I went to purchase The New Adventures Of Wonder Woman DVD yesterday, but Circuit City was sold out.  This surprised me.  I had to go to three different Circuit City stores to find a copy and I got the last one.  I had a gift card so I wanted to use it.  It brought back so many memories to watch it.  It was much cheesier than I remember from when I was eight years old.  I realized that the last time I saw these episodes was 29 years ago.  It was hysterical to see Fannie (Fried Green Tomatoes) Flagg as the Amazon Doctor and Cloris Leachman was horrible as Queen Hypolite.  It was just to shades away from being a French & Saunders sketch.  I also realized how much they watered down Wonder Woman.  She is rolling around on a desk struggling with Stella Stevens and in the comic book Wonder Woman would have kicked her ass with her pinkie.  She is strong as Superman.  Still, I love the plots taking place in WWII.  Jeff watched a bit of it with me tonight.  Every time Diana Prince spun around and turned into Wonder Woman, he was captivated.

       IT WAS JUST MONDAY....   It's amazing how quickly time flies.  My mother always said that you older you get, the faster time goes.  Perhaps it has something to do with momentum gained going down hill.  However, age is a state of mind and I don't mean to imply that as you get older, everything goes to hell.  In fact, I feel better with every year and I'm in better shape now than when I was younger.  Maybe as we age our molecules vibrate at a faster rate.  It's been a busy week.  Wednesday and Thursday were especially busy.  Wednesday was Jeff's birthday and he turned 45.  That makes him nine years older than me, which seems to freak some people out for some reason.  Personally, I find him delightfully immature on some levels so I'm sure we even out.  (Just kidding.)  He had dinner with his family and I went to voiceover class.  We were going to go out for dinner and a movie last night, but he decided he just wanted a night at home and we're going to go out on Sunday evening.  However, we actually went to eat the Flat Iron Grill in East Atlanta because we didn't feel like cooking.   The Flat Iron Grill is a smoker's paradise, but it wasn't overly smokey.  There were quite a few pumped up gay men there, which surprised me because it doesn't really reek with fabulousness.  I had the parmesean chicken with wild rice and sauteed vegetables and let me tell you, those sauteed vegetables were delicious.  I suspect they had a lot of salt, but I don't eat them every day.  Last night we cleaned the house because my close friend, Susan, is coming to visit today.  I could have a month's worth of blog entries for my adventures with Susan, but suffice it to say that for the years 1989-1994, the Dallas/Fort Worth area wasn't safe if we were around.  I'm looking forward to seeing her.  It used to be impossible for us not to speak several times a day and now we may trade two or three e-mails per year and go to dinner when I'm home for the holidays.  It's strange, but it's juse one of those, "Omigod!  I've grown up and become and adult!" things.  Yesterday, I became totally obsessed with the Eurythmics again.  I found a mix CD I made with several of their remixes of the greatest hits and it was fantastic.  I had completely forgotten some of the imagery that Annie Lennox could paint with words.  "When you touch my skin, I smell disaster," and "I could give you a mirror to show you disappointment."  It's definitely not Bananarama, but still good stuff.   I met with Danny on Wednesday afternoon to discuss scripts.  I was a little apprehensive because Danny had ripped me a new hole because my script was 137 pages long and you should really try to have it no longer than 120 pages.  After printing out his script, I saw it was 125 pages.  However, I suspected that his comment was truly intended to be helpful and his manner was specific to his personality.   I actually enjoyed Danny's script.  It was well written.   I gave him some feedback about what stood out for me and what came to mind.  Some of my thoughts he had heard from other people already and some of my suggestions were new and seemed to excite him.  I always offer feedback as just my opinion and do with it what you feel you need to do.  It's easier to see things from the outside than the inside when it comes to written work.  Danny gave me some good feedback on mine.  Ironically, he didn't make a lot of marks in my script.  Even after Jeff and I had gone through it twice, Danny still found a few typos.  It was a bit embarrassing.  He said he laughed out loud several times, which is not an easy thing to do.  That made me feel good and suggested some pieces of dialogue I could cut.  My playwriting background always makes me feel compelled to spell everything out, which I don't need to do in a screenplay.  A movie tells a story through action.  A play tells a story through dialogue.  I was already aware of this.  Most importantly, Danny gave me some confidence in a few areas of my script that I was questioning.  He felt they were fine so I'm not going to worry about them anymore.  His thoughts were basically that I have two stories.  One is about a little girl who falls in love with her gay neighbor and tries to kill his new boyfriend.  The other is about both the neighbor and the little girl's mother beginning to date again.  I was actually surprised I wrote so much about the relationships and I'm going to edit that down.  I also read through the script a bit the other night and was able to see things I wanted to tighten up.  I'm feeling good about it.  Danny and I are going to get together again in early September with two of the other contestants from the Perfect Pitch Contest and just kind of talk about screenwriting and swap books and stuff.  We're going to do rewrites to share with each other in October.  The Mothball will be over by then.  It's nice to know other people who have the same interests and goals that I do.   We understand and support one another.  In closing, I'd like to put the Cult of Jef Spotlight on  urlLink Me Southern .  He had a very inspirational post from yesterday about a friend of his.  It encompasses many things, but I have found it very moving and motivating.

       VOICEOVER CLASS #5   I'm really feeling bad that I have had so little time to do my homework for voiceover class.  It would have been better if I took this class in October.  I saw Kevin tonight.  I ran into him at the baseball game on Friday.  It was so weird seeing someone I know in the 45,000 people at the game.  We spoke briefly and there was nothing to say.  Ironically, it seemed there was so much to say last Friday.  Mr. Puppydog continues to watch me out of the corner of his eye, but tonight I was too tired to care.  I asked a question tonight and Stuart jumped.  He said I always sneak in and it takes him by surprise when he first notices me.  He asked me what my name was and I told him that my Hewbrew name was Esther.  He thought I was serious and I could see him bracing himself for my dietary requirements.  I think he likes me.  I think he likes me because I'm a natural smart ass.  Don't be fooled by cheap immitations.  We all went around the room and read the same sentence differently.  The whole blending thing still throws me off, but I decided to read the line as if I was trying to pick someone up in a bar.  Evidently I did very well.  I was told that I sounded like a cross between Hugo Speer in  The Matrix  and James Mason.  Sadly, none of the women were moved enough to offer to have my baby.  We then went around the room and read our commercials.  Spanish Girl read a commercial about fake eye lashes.  She read with greate excitement and her voice went higher and higher with each word.  I thought she was going to explode.  I almost ran for the hills for safety.  She has an interesting accent without an accent.  Mr. Puppydog reads everything as if the sirens have gone off to tell everyone to evacuate the city.  He has a youthful voice, but I wish he'd slow down.  Eric read a radio spot for a safe place for teenage runaways to go to.  He has a nice voice like everyone's best friend.  Stuart thought it conjured up images of child molesters being tempted by these children waiting in these safe places.  I suggested that Eric read it again as Hanibal Lecter.  One of the local anchor people off the evening news is in our class.  He's a nice guy with a great voice.  I spoke to Stuart tonight as I left about continuing to take classes with him after the class is over.  He thought it was a good idea and thinks that I have potential.  After five weeks, I'm encouraged.

       DRIVING HOME   I stopped at a traffic light by  Centential Park , which is next to  Philips Arena  and  CNN Center .  There is a huge video screen on the outside of the building.  As I looked up, they were showing footage of  Sesame Street On Ice .  There were some new muppets with lots of dangly tentacles.  They were very unsettling.  Then they disolved into Van Halen.  The light turned green and I moved on.  I was be-bopping along to Gary Numan's  Cars  when I passed a truck with a man in the back.  He was bent over and appeared to be moving something around because it looked like he was shaking his butt in time to the music in my car.  It made me laugh.

       I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ORAL SEX AGAIN   Why do we refer to fellatio as a blow job? You don't actually blow anything up. Well, not with explosives anyway. I always pictured a frazzled mother blowing air into a life-size, inflatable Barney through an air nozzle conveniently placed in his groin. Can you imagine doing that to another guy? I like to take my time. I'm afraid that he would explode from over inflation. Then again, what if you lost your grip and he went flying all helter skelter all over the room?  Furthermore, why do we refer to orally stimulating an anus, vagina or clitoris as eating out? You don't actually pay a check or leave a tip. There is no basket of hot rolls and the vagina is the last place you would want to bring yeast to. You do not actually take a bite of anything and ingest it for sustenance. I've never seen someone squirt a shot of tabasco sauce onto an anus, vagina or clitoris and chow down.  English sure is funny language.

       BOND'ING AT THE OFFICE   I left the house at 6:20am to go to the  PowerCore  meeting. I was a bit off the cuff today and people seemed to find the phrase "drinking a beer while sitting in a lawn chair in a kiddie pool in his backyard" very funny. Personally I don't get it. I was just selling a dream. One of the Gopher Girls returned.  I met a client at a bagel place and took her application and then drove to the office. I worked at my desk putting together several files I needed to turn in. Kiki gave me a Shirley Bassey CD to listen to that is nothing but remixes of her hit songs from her long and illustrious career. It has several of the James Bond theme songs she has recorded such as:  Diamonds Are Forever ;  Moonraker ; and  Goldfinger . (I bet you didn't realize there was a theme song to  Moonraker , did you?) I kept humming  Goldfinger  to myself. Finding myself alone and the office quiet, I suddenly had the urge to belt out, "Mistah Goooooldfingaaaaah. He's the man, the man with the Midus touch, a spidah's touch." I sang the whole song through and then turned to find all of my co-workers in the doorway of our office staring at me. Without missing a beat, I said, "Tips are appreciated," and walked past them to copy pay-stubs and bank statements. They all broke into applause. You know something? They're kind of weird.

       DALLAS 1992-1993   I moved to Dallas, Texas in 1992. I felt I needed to start over again. I had graduated from  UTA  the following year and was still living in a duplex near school with Chris, my roommate, friend and... something between fuck buddy and boyfriend. I basically had a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1992. The catalyst was finding a message from Chris' boyfriend on the answering machine. (And you thought that kind of thing just happened in movies.) At the time, I thought we were getting closer to a permanent relationship, but evidently I was mistaken. In reality, it didn't have much to do with Chris. I was nursing wounds from my family and my grandmother's death from many years before. Ultimately, I had a great fear of abandoment, which stemmed from a time when my parents separated and almost divorced and my grandmother dying on the operating table while undergoing bypass surgery. My grandmother was the most important person in my life and when she died, I was gutted. I just realized her birthday was yesterday.  I had opted for being laid off from  TRW , where I was working at the time, and did not accept their offer to move to Atlanta. (The irony is not lost on me.) It just didn't seem like it was the right time. I didn't feel like I could move to a new city where I didn't know anyone. Instead, I took a job at  JC Penney's  in a credit call center for  Saks 5th Avenue . Chris decided he wanted a change to and we moved together. In hindsight, it was probably not the best idea, but we had made a pledge to always be friends and be there for one another no matter what. Loyalty means something to me. We chose an apartment complex where fellow conspirators of Timothy McVey would be arrested a few years later.  The job at  Penney's  didn't pan out. The manager for the  Saks Fifth Avenue  credit division met me and decided she hated me. I know that sounds like something a kid would say, but it was literally what happened. I said good morning to her and her lip curled up. I had 100+ scores on my training tests and one day was asked to leave. At first I was angry because I had never been fired before and I called them on their bluff. The head of HR got nervous and I realized that it was a blessing in disguise. The place was like a Nazi concentration camp. People were written up for being late when there was a huge wreck on the freeway.  Suddenly without a job, I went and applied at  Today's Temporary  and was working the next day. This led to a temporary to permanent job for  American Eagle Aviation Insurance . I worked for a boy from Iceland named Thor. He looked like one of the children from  The Village of the Damned  all grown up. Thor liked me and inisted on getting right in my face to speak with me. He had very bad breath. I was always offering him gum, but he never took the hint. One day I swore I would feign being overwhelmed by the odor and pass out. I never did.  There was gray sense of melancholy that underscored my existence at that time. I made very little money and had a college degree that seemed worthless in the recession. Madonna's  Erotica  album was the big thing and I don't recall ever hearing any of the songs on the radio. I was far from Susan and Joan and the friends I did make in Dallas seemed very superficial. Chris was still seeing "the boyfriend" occasionally. Susan and I finally got a look at him and we thought he looked like Floyd the barber on the  Andy Griffith Show  so we began referring to him as Floyd. Chris and I still maintained a consistent sex life just to make things really confusing for both of us.  I would sometimes go to the  Wave  with Colin and we would pick up abandoned drinks off the railing and offer them to people we didn't like. We eventually began spending time at the  Round Up  and before long I had a pair of ropers. I liked to watch the men dance together. After you adjusted to the shock of seeing men dance together, it really is quite beautiful. I remember watching one fellow in particular when the lights were down low as he two-stepped around the floor to Pam Tillis'  Maybe It Was Memphis . It was straight out of a movie and I fell in love with him. Some time later I actually met him and he had a very high voice and was very effeminate. This was not congruent with the picture I had created, but it taught me something. It's best not to fall in love with someone until you really know them. It wasn't his efeminancy that bothered me. It was the fact that I had constructed an entire illusion based upon my needs instead of just allowing myself to get to know someone's authentic self.  We used to talk to Randall, the doorman. He was funny and wise and taught me that I should never wear a straw hat after Labor Day. Randall smoked cigarettes that smelt like the kind my grandmother used to smoke. I don't like cigarette smoke, but I love the smell of when a cigarette is first lit. There was another boy that I used to watch. He was closer to my age, always wore a pager and I liked the way he chewed gum. Randall said he had a buiscit butt, flat and round.  I should have asked more people to dance, but I was afraid. I didn't feel that I danced very well even though I went to the lessons on Sunday evening. Kent danced very well and would stay on the floor all night. Our friend, Danita, came with us and I used to practive with her, but I soon became frustrated and quit. She always insisted on leading and had trouble with the turns. Danita was a big girl from Kansas and when we came to a turn, she would just pick me up and set me down again. It was very disporienting and I soon just had to say no.  I don't know when exactly it happened, but one day without saying it, Randall communicated to me that I needed to quit hanging out in a cowboy bar and talking to the doorman and live my life. He was pushing the baby bird from the nest. It was just in his eyes when he looked at me. "You're young. You should be living not wasting your time talking to an old coot like me." I moved on even though I liked talking to him.  In January of 1993, Kent was diagnosed with HIV and eventually full-blown AIDS. I was devastated. Donna, Michael and I gathered around him in his father's house. It got very serious and I asked him if I could have his couch when he died. Kent busted out laughing. No one understood because we understood each other in ways even we didn't know. I just knew he had become far to serious and I had to ground him with humor.  We had our own language like twins and our devotion to one another was matched by no one other than possibly a mama bear and her cub. After all, we had been friends since we were 13.  Kent spent a lot of time talking with Randall, who was also positive. I took time off from work to be with him. He started on medications and slowly began to return to his normal life. Meanwhile, the underlying depression that was already there was only further complicated by Kent's diagnosis. For the first time in my life, I had several mornings where I woke up and just didn't have the motivation to get out of bed. It drove me crazy to lie there, but it just didn't seem like there was anything worth getting up for. Things weren't getting better, they were getting worse.  To be continued....

       GIVE ME AN OMEN, GIVE ME A SIGN   Living in Grant Park, I meet a lot of interesting neighbors.  On the way back from one of my morning runs, I met an older lady who practices what I guess would be mailiomancy.  She meditates on a question in her life and then reads her mail like tarot cards.   Problem: she can never find her bifocals or car keys.  Mail: an offer for recipe cards and a misdirected copy of Field & Stream with a big hefty bass on the cover.  Meaning: eat more fish to improve her memory.  I thought I would give it a whirl:  Problem: I don't have enough time to work on my writing projects.  Mail: an offer for a free booklet  Practicing the Presence of God ; an offer from Providian to give me a free FICO score; copy of  Daily Word  featuring a woman who is preserving North American folk songs when not serving as a chuck wagon cook on cattle drives and an offer to receive six issues of  [2]  magazine for just $19.99, which features hot photospreads of beefy gay couples getting it on for my entertainment pleasure.  Meaning: I'm afraid to know.  More over, who has sold my information so that I now receive offers for gay porn?  I bet it's that damn  Children's Digest .

       IT CAME FROM THE 23RD PEW   I looked up casually and saw the red eyes glowing at me as Reverend John continued his sermon on prophetic ministry.  I leaned forward to get a better look. It appeared to be battery operated and quite large, say 12-inches.  It seemed to be a cross between an insect, human and android.  He had a friend and the little boy was pitting them against one another as Reverend John talked about our ultimate quest for world peace.  "Why can't we all just get along?"  The little boy, who I call Jamar just because it felt right to me, had one action figure toss the other across the pew.  Next, he tossed him in the air and I full expected Jamar to hurl one of the bugoids high in the air and lodge it in the rafters. The little toy arms clinging for escape to the beam above us. However, that didn't happen.  The sermon ended and we gave our tithes and offerings, blessed it, read the ticket for the winner of the book store gift certificate for parking in remote parking and taking the shuttle and then joined hands to sing  The Peace Song .  Boy, that sounds funny when you read it.  It sounds a bit cultish, but that's far too interesting for me.  Jamar reminded me of what I was like when I was younger and going to our local Church of Christ in Waco, Texas.  My mother used to give us Lifesaver candy until the day she looked over and found me with my head leaned over the back of the pew dangling a cherry candy in my mouth by the little waxy, green string you use to open the package.  I think she knocked me on the back of my head to have me sit up, but instead I dropped the Lifesaver in my mouth and swallowed it whole, green string and all.  Another time she got bent out of shape because I was reading a Spider-Man anthology in church.  Okay, so maybe I was reclining across the pew with my head resting on one hand, similar to Burt Reynolds infamoust Cosmopolitan centerfold, but I ask you, "Was I hurting anybody?"  Furthermore, I was reading about the forces of good triumphing over the forces of evil.  One day we were sitting in church and a little boy maybe five or six was standing in the pew in front of us.  He stared at my mother and then stuck his tongue out.  He turned around for a moment and then repeated it.  He did this several times before his own mother caught him and took him outside the sanctuary and spanked him.  I smiled as I listened to the little cuss get what he deserved.  On our way to the steakhouse after the service, I asked my mother if she heard the little boy scream as he received his spanking.  "Yes," she replied.  "But now I feel bad that I stuck my tongue out first."

       THERE IS A SONG IN MY HEAD   It never fails that there is always a song in my head that I absentmindly hum to myself through out the day. Lately, it's been She Bangs by Ricky Martin. I'm not sure why. I have nothing against Ricky. He is a fine man. Well, he is a FINE man, but what I meant is that I have no bone to pick with... This is just getting worse. You know what I mean. Anyway, I like to sing it with great emphasis on the "Bangs."    Me:

       WEEKEND POST-MORTEM   My head is still spinning from how quickly this weekend went by.  Friday evening Jeff and I went to Braves game with Brian and Brian.  It's funny to think that we can walk to Turner Field from our house, but it's not a good idea to try and walk back at night through Summer Hill.   At the edge of the parking lot there is a tall metal tower that is crowned with the cauldron from the '96 Olympics.  It symbolizes so many things to me since I moved out here in May of that year and people told me I wouldn't find a job or a place to live because of the Olympics.  Many people left the city and frankly, traffic couldn't have been better.  Eight years have gone by since that time andmy life has changed in so many ways.  When I look at the cauldron now, it makes me think of McDonalds french fries because it is shaped like one of those red containers.  I may need to take a picture and do some Photoshop work.  Turner field is about a third of the Olympic Stadium that was used in 1996 and is now home to the Atlanta Braves.  We had really good seats for the game against the Mets.  It was a good game.  It moved along quickly and we won.  I was surprised to see how many of my favorite players have been traded.  I had a foot long hot dog and it was good.  Saturday morning, I woke up early and Kiki (he chose the code name, not me) and I went swimming.  David, his partner, joined us later and he taught me how to do turns at the end of the pool.  I actually picked it up pretty well.   Kiki has decided that Sophie Ellis-Bextor should sing theme song for the next Bond movie.  For once, I have to agree with him.  The concept is utter genius and it's the one time that I can actually say that I am jealous I did not think of it first.  Afterward, we went to Starbucks with their neighbors and I had a mulit-grained bagel and passion fruit iced tea.  Why do they call it passion fruit?  I certainly didn't feel passionate after I drank it.  I did laundry and met one of my clients to sign paperwork.  I received three more leads over the weekend.  Business keeps getting better and better.  I'm beginning to make serious money and many people keep reminding me that it's okay.  I work hard and I don't take adavntage of people.  I think it's beginning to sink in.  I met Jeff on the south side yesterday evening to see Spider-Man 2.  All I wanted was an unsalted pretzel.  I ordered it in addition to popcorn and a Coke for Jeff and a Diet Coke for me.  After she has the popcorn and soft drinks, she informs me that they are out of pretzels.   I suppose the pretzels on display are "stunt pretzels" and are not edible.  She tells me to come back in fifteen minutes.  I make my way to my seat and I have already missed part of the movie.  I wait 30-minutes and head back, wait in line only to be informed that the pretzels are still not done. I know it's not the girl's fault, but all I wanted was a friggin' pretzel.  I did not want a hot dog or nachos.  I wanted a pretzel.  I have already bought a $3 Diet Coke that is useless to me without the pretzel.  I didn't go back because I could not in good conscience trample over the people at the end of the row again.  The movie was good, but I cringed at the foreshadowing of the next movie's villain.  I'm assuming they will probably have two villians.  I thought Kirstin Dunst looked pretty running through New York City in her wedding dress.   Afterwards, Jeff mentioned that he found the dialogue in three sections stilted and awkward. I, on the other hand, found those three sections to be written very well and had marveled over the writing and the performance.  He had already made a condescending remark about my pretzel frustration and it just went down hill from there.  It was like he was George W. and I was John Kerry.   Jeff was on the computer for most of today shopping for a computer for the book store.  He finally found one.  We were supposed to go see Truth Or Dare at the drive-in as a fundraiser for  urlLink Out On Film , but only a few of us showed up so we went to  urlLink Front Page News  for dinner instead.  Afterwards, we went to Jake's for ice cream. I got a half scoop of two of my favorites: strawberry cheesecake; and chocolate leya cake.  I haven't read any blogs over the weekend and just checked my e-mail.  I received a very nice note from  urlLink Jesse .  It seems he printed out my screenplay from my portfolio website and read all of  urlLink Millicent Meyers' Magnificient Murder Plan  in one sitting.  I know it's 137 pages, but the screenwriting format usese more paper than a novel so you're really not reading as much.  I really appreciate his time and his feedback.   I did make a quick post as a guest blogger for  urlLink Ya Ya Empress  while she's in Italy with Chris the Great.  As a favor to me, keep  urlLink Gregory  in your thoughts tomorrow.  His father is having heart surgery.  Well, I did catch up on CNN.com for a moment, but now I'm off to bed. It's an early day tomorrow and I may not be able to blog again until tomorrow night.  I wish you all well.
