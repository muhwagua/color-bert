       Dee Dee Ramone   First Joey and now just a few months after the Hall of Fame Induction ceremony, Dee Dee Ramone passes away at the age of only 50. I am not a Ramones fan but I know what they meant to the history of music and this is just another surprising loss in the world of punk.

      Do I think John Ashcroft overstated the dirty bomb conspiracy?  Yes, yes he did.  That's the first thing that came to my mind when they released the information about the big arrest at Chicago O'Hare.  It was obvious he wants to take some heat off the FBI in a time when they are getting grilled.  I don't doubt this guy Jose Padilla is a bad dude and was up to something, but Ashcroft is making the story bigger than it really is.  And that's just my two cents.

      I just have to say thank you.  Thank you to Korn for putting out an incredible album.  Every song is pounding but at the same time melodic.  Loud but soft in spots.  Jonathon Davis on this album totally uses every single inch of his voice capabilities.  From that raucous loud to that high pitch soft voice.  I didn't get Issues which people say was pretty bad.  But I have to say people will embrace this album.  I have to say, this is the first album in a long time that I was hoping for a lot and got more than that.  If I have to pick one song that rises above the others, it's Hollow Life(track 4).  But every song just kicks ass.  I also got Tragically Hip's In Violet Light.  I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this album.  But I already know that this album will grow on me like every Hip album does.  Just need to have more listens to it.  Did I mention How much I loved Korn's album?  Damn good album.  I highly recommend it.  Other news.  Ireland cruises into the round of 16 in the world cup.  The whole country is going mad.  Waiting for USA to play their final game in the first round to see if they get into the next round.  They play Poland.  Hopefully USA will beat a team of Wiesaks.  In the next few weeks, I hope to have some renovation done on my geocities site.  Just haven't been up to making the changes.  I will eventually though.  Until next time, later

      My work week is over already.  Busy weather means my work week flies by.  Still waiting to hear if I get off on the 13th of July.  If I don't, then no attendance at a wedding for me.  If I do get the day off then I'll be the dude at the bar at Fisher's Tudor House.  I have absolutely nothing else to add right now.  Don't feel like writing. later

      New Update at the  urlLink OLD CONVOLUTION !  USA vs. Mexico at 2:30 this morning(early Monday morning).  Good Luck to USA.  Too bad for Ireland, they had more than a shot to win their game versus the spaniards of Spain.  Hope the camping trip was good for you guys who went up to NE PA.  Sorry I missed your calls Patrick but there's a little thing called work in which I was attending!  Hopefully you didn't wake up my roommates!  Or I'll layeth down the smacketh.  Until next time....

      Guys, you must check out this  urlLink satellite photo of the snow cover  over the Northeast... IT IS VERY COOL!!   If you want a more detailed, HIGH resolution photo, just check out the link above the photo that says 1 km.  This 1 km resolution photo is extremely large so download time will be quite long on dial up connection.  A thing to note on this picture, you can see the darkened areas located where D.C., Philadelphia, New York, and Boston reside.  You can also see the partially frozen Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.  You can easily see the Finger Lakes of New York and the rippled Appalachian Mtns of Pennsylvania and where the three rivers come together to meet Pittsburgh.

      What is one of the best shows on TV right now that nobody in the United States has seen? The Answer:   urlLink The Trailer Park Boys   It's a Canadian television show on a network called Showcase which is very similar to HBO.  Now what do I suggest in order to watch the episodes?  (By the way, Season 3 starts on April 3rd).  Kazaa or other shared file networks will get the job done.  Steve B., I know you are big into downloading certain television episodes so I highly recommend you look into this show!  Give it a shot with Season 1 Episode 1 and you'll get hooked.  The characters in this show are incredible.....Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, Mr. Lahey, Randy, etc.  The show is basically about a bunch of degenerates(mainly Ricky and Julian) who live in a trailer park and try to put their convict lives behind them and lead a straight and narrow life but continually get pulled back into the criminal way of life.  That description may make this show sound like a drama but it certainly isn't!!  It's one of the funniest shows out there today that nobody knows about.  If you ever get a chance to watch an episode, you must check it out!  Maybe I'll bring up a few cd's-worth of episodes when I come up to PA.  I'm out....

      Ok Ok, I know most of you had to put up with snow and sleet and cold for more than three months now but just last night(Wed night into Thurs morn.), my house in Marietta picked up more than 3 inches of rain in less than 12 hours!  T-storm after t-storm passed over northern suburbs of ATL.  The rivers and creeks of north Georgia were overrunning their banks and street flooding and mudslides were reported across the area.  Now it is safe to say that I will not be playing soccer anytime soon.  Our first two game were rained out and now the fields will be a swampy mess....a quagmire if you will.  The fields not only won't recover by this weekend but they will likely be a mess for weeks to come.  Oh well.  Patrick T., this may be a good idea from Apple, but can't you already download any generic mp3 onto your iPod as it is???  Why is this necessary?  This is taken from eonline.com : "Apple Computers and the major record labels joining forces to start an online music subscription service within several weeks to allow Netizens to buy and download digital music for their Macintosh or iPod."  Do they expect to make profit out of this?  How come here in the U.S., we hear of the many suicide bombings that Palestines perform against Israelis but we never hear or see the tragic and  urlLink barbaric retaliation  by the Israelis against Palestine?  I mean, this seemed to pass over the radar screen without a blip.  I'm not one to praise musicals(and I won't be seeing Moulin Rouge   or Chicago   anytime soon) but I just saw  Singin' in the Rain  for the first time a few days ago and I have to say, WOW.  Not one actor or actress today can measure up to Gene Kelly or Debbie Reynolds.  The singing, choreography, tap dancing, and acting itself in this movie far outweighs the actors we proclaim superstars today.  One a side note, Gene Kelly is a graduate of Penn State.  We have a pool here at work that we created back in February, guessing when the first day of the war will be with Iraq.  I put down March 11th, looks like I may be pretty darn close.  Like I said in my email to Nancy,  "I'm not gonna tell you and say that oil has no factor in this war but I like to believe that GWB is a good, Christian man looking out for the U.S.'s best interests.....which is protecting us!  Saddam is a madman.  Like GWB's arguement, it is just a matter of time that the weapons he sells to terrorist groups or even weapons that he has in his hands ends up exploding on U.S. soil."   I'm on edge like the rest of America and the time during war is a very anxious time but this is the right thing to do.  We must take action now before we get bitten.  This is just something very cool that I found.  It's a  urlLink picture of Lake Superior  with huge ice chunks floating around.  As you know this has been one of the coldest winters in many years and it's not everyday that Lake Superior becomes frozen over!  This is very large picture so download may take a few minutes.  I'll probably link more of these pictures with time.  This type of VERY HIGH resolution satellite images can be found around once a month so I'll keep checking to see when new images come on in.  Guys, have you picked up  Dredg's El Cielo yet ???  C'mon on now, give it a listen.  Like I said, it's one of the best CD's I have listened to probably ever.  Check out their samples of  Same Ol' Road  and  Sanzen  at  urlLink this link .  And on a sad note, the death toll keeps on rising from the RI concert venue fire ...."The death toll in the Rhode Island nightclub fire now stands at 99 after a 39-year-old man died Thursday of injuries sustained in the blaze. Meanwhile, an attorney for Great White says the band's manager always made sure he got permission from clubs for the use of pyrotechnics"   Alrighty, I am out

      C'mon guys, make comments.....debate me....make a discussion here!  Say something controversial so I can retort!  I'll accept many comments but I will not accept comments from my brother with the common, "YOU ARE A MORON", or maybe the special "YOU ARE A TOOL" phrases.  That will be frowned upon and will not be acknowledged!!  Oh, and to just comment on Brian Mitchell, now formerly of the Philadelphia Eagles.......HE IS A TRAITOR!!!!  Come on Hugh, sign with the EAGLES.....if you go, we will all of a sudden begin to see the beginnings of the downward spiral of the Eagles!  But I can't blame everything on the players not signing...I have to blame the Eagles' front office as well.  We are the single team that made it to the final four of the NFL playoffs that were comfortably under the cap and we can't sign our players!!  WTF!!!!!!!  ARGH!!  OK, time to watch 24 that I taped last night.  Is there ever a bad episode of this show?  The only way to improve the show is to get rid of Elisha Cuthbert....what the hell is the point to have her on the show?  Her storyline is pathetic....a f*ckin' cougar?  What is that?  Must kill her off at the end of the season.  Make Kate the new subject of next season!  ok, enough for now...

      I've ignored it for too long!   THE BLOGGER!   I can't promise continuous, more frequent updates but I'll try. Sometimes, you just have absolutely nothing to say, and sometimes you do.  Let me say first that the South is more liberal than you may think it is.  I know more people who are conservative in their views up North than I do down here.  I think it's because of my proximity to the ATL.  As you veer away from the big city, the views become less liberal.  Sometimes I just don't know how liberals come up with their retarded arguments.  It completely baffles me.  Their arguments are completely idealistic and not realistic.  That's the best I can do to capitulate their side.  Who in the limelight are Bush supporters?  Well let me say that Dennis Miller is one intelligent man.  His reasoning behind his beliefs are so well thought out and just make so much sense.  Try to catch an interview with him whenever you get the chance.  He's recently done a spin of talkshows as of late so he might take some time off right now.  I hope he writes a book soon.  Maybe he's already in the thick of it.  Ron Silver is another actor who is an avid Bush supporter.  I need to look more into what he has to say but I did catch an interview with on the FNC Beltway Boys.  Again, his arguments and opinions are so clear and well thought out.  Thank goodness that the intelligent "hollywood" community supports the Bush Administration and not like people such as Fred Durst.  One word....."AGREEANCE".....WTF is that????  Yes, I know Eddie Vedder is an extreme liberal and yes I am a fan of Pearl Jam but again, Eddie has an idealistic view of the world.  It's a flawed vision.  He has to wake up and smell the coffee.  Although, I should thank him and his political followers for voting for Nader.  If it wasn't for him.......well, you know the rest.  And sort of keeping on the political side of things and getting into religion, does anybody you know feel this is the beginning of the end?  Many people I have talked to believe that world events are coming together and lining up with what was foretold in the book of Revelations.  Talking about the EU(european union), the Euphrates River(runs through Iraq), something like a 100 million man army(China and their backing of North Korea).  I think they may be looking too much into what is happening right now.  I don't know, I refuse to believe that God put us down here to just let us live until we screw it all up.  What's the purpose behind that?  I'm sure we all had the same drawn conclusions during WWI, WWII, the Civil War, Vietnam, and most likely during the coldest years of the "Cold War"(especially during the early '60s.)  I think it's just natural for humans to look for Judgement Day and they want to be prepared for it.  But for me, yes, I hope I will be ready but I can't go around looking for signs of impending doom.  None of us know and I like to believe the human race has many, many more years ahead of it.  In fact, I'm just gonna go out and say it.  This is not the beginning of the end.  However, if John Travolta does another Battlefield Earth, then I may have to do some rethinking.  Oh shit, he's in talks to do a sequel. D'oh!   DREDG  Remember this band's name.    El Cielo  Remember the name of their latest CD.  It's one of the best cd's I have picked up ever.  They are a mix of Radiohead, A Perfect Circle, and Duran Duran.  Yes, I said Duran Duran.  But don't let that scare you.  Seriously, you won't be disappointed by this cd.  If you are, then your musical tastes are crap.  Their second track off of this album is the best and you can go  urlLink here  to listen to it.  It's called, "Same Ol' Road".  Try out the other songs as well, especially "Sanzen"(track 3)!  This won't be the last you will hear me talking about this band.  I'm gonna go out and purchase their first cd soon.  They will be in Philly on March 22nd, and yes I will be home during this time but their concert falls on one of the busiest days I will have had in a while so I hope to catch them another time.  Quick note about the band....they are all in their mid 20s and grew up in Los Gatos, CA(a place I acutally have been), but now reside in So. Cal.   The movie Daredevil was crap.  The only saving grace of the movie was the acting by Colin Farrell and seeing Jennifer Garner in the black outfit.  But other than that, this movie should just remain one movie.  No sequel please.  Just let it go!  On the plus side, I did see the trailer for X-men 2.....this movie will be awesome.  Have I said enough?  For now, maybe.....

Or maybe I'm the only one and I have a problem......hmmmm   Elizabeth Smart  Is it me or does  urlLink she  really look like  urlLink Jenna Bush   , one of the twin daughters of President Bush?  I smell conspiracy!   Lousy weather  Well, not a minute after we get the fabulous weather down here in the ATL, we are gonna be getting into the 50s and rain for the weekend.  Nasty stuff.  Hopefully it will clear out by St. Patrick's Day.  Early model guidance suggests PC skies and temps in the 70s....NICE!

       Three Lakes Frozen  It hasn't happened in a long time but the Great Lakes of  urlLink Huron, Erie, and Superior  have all frozen over due to the harsh, bitterly cold, ongoing winter.   Wildcats  Congratulations to the  urlLink Villanova Wildcats women's basketball team  for defeating the Connecticut Huskies who had a 70 game winning streak.  It was the longest winning streak in women's college basketball history.   Snow in Philly for Thursday?   Possibly!!  Check out the lower right hand panel  urlLink at this link .  Check out the Rain/Snow line that goes south of Philly.  Everything to the north of that line is mainly snow and to the south is mainly rain.  This winter won't die!  All this being said though, I think that Philadelphia will just get a cold rain while NYC and points north and west will get more snow out of this system.  Anyway, it's going up to 80 today with mostly sunny skies here in Atlanta!  HA HA!

       DC Comics and Warner Bros.....a match made in hell!  OK OK.....Warner Bros. Studios is completely destroying the comic book adaptations of two of our favorite super heros.  Actually, I should say they have already destroyed the Batman franchise(can you say Joel Shumacher?) and now they are looking to destroy the Superman franchise.  This is a disgrace.  I have been following this situation ever since Batman and Robin came out.  I knew at that time, that the whole concept of Batman on film has to be completely overhauled.  And since then, WB studios has f*cked around with screenplay after screenplay, script after script, director after director.  Now we are at the point that the Batman franchise has been shelved for the time being and the WB is now focusing their energy on the Superman franchise.  This mainly has to do with the popularity of Smallville and how fresh Superman is in people's minds right now.  Anyway, now let me get to the point here.  Basically, like I said, Superman is now the focus but the WB can't even get this right.  A-list actor after A-list is turning down the lead role mainly due to the stereotype that hampers the actor after he partakes in the role.  But I also believe that these actors(and their agents as well) realize what a disgrace the going-script for the movie is right now!  The creators of Superman must be rolling in their graves if they knew what the latest adaptation is.  Just go to this  urlLink link here  and see what I am talking about.  And the "actors" that the WB is hunting for add even more travesty to this situation.  Ok, so I may be overreacting but this is Superman and Batman we are talking about here.  This is part of the American pop culture and should be dealt with cautiously and reverently.   More serious news...  I won't be long here because the message is short.  Screw the UN, it's time to cut the crap and begin the regime change in Iraq.  Time to go in on our own and take matters into our own hands.  I'm at the point where I think we should have gone in on our own in the first place and disregard the pathetic and irrelevant United Nations.  We are now hurting ourselves in this delay.  The daytime temperatures are rapidly increasing as we head further into March and the sandstorm season in Iraq is alive and well also.  When the war begins, I can imagine the many helicopters(and other aircraft) that may go down as sand interrupts the mechanics of the engines and blades.  It's now or never. If we wait to late March, it will be a  BIG  mistake.   Patrick T. and peanuts  I only know one person that is allergic to peanuts so Patrick Tomachevsky,  urlLink this article is for you .   GAS GAS GAS  Well, we all know that the price at the pump is out of control these days but we are lucky here in Atlanta.  The going rate is one of the cheapest in the country at just $1.45 a gallon.  I'm sure San Franciscans are envious of that price as they are paying almost a dollar more per gallon at  urlLink $2.43 !! D'oh!   Johnny Cash movie  Alot of stuff happening for Johnny Cash these days.  First he has a radio single and the accompanying video spinning on top 40 stations and rolling out on VH1 and MTV2 respectively for his song in which he covers Nine Inch Nail's "Hurt".....(not bad if I do say so myself, albeit a bit depressing).  Now there is new biopic of that will star Joaquin Phoenix(of "Signs" and "Gladiator" fame) as the man himself and Reese Witherspoon as his wife June Carter.  Could be good movie but it is far off right now considering that the actors were just recently signed on to the film.

       St. Patrick's Day  Yes, it's St. Patrick's Day....Happy St. Patrick's Day to all!  My friend Patrick is actually down here in the ATL.  We are leaving in 5 or 6 hours to Savannah, GA, from this moment now which is around or almost 11 pm Sunday night.  We hope to beat the treacherous Atlanta rush hour traffic.  It's absolutely horrendous.  Next stop is the second biggest St. Patrick's Day celebration in the world!  Around 300,000 people come to Savannah each year on March 17th.  It'll be quite a fest of beverages tomorrow to say the least.  Then from there, we are heading back to the ATL and taking a flight up to Philly.  That's it for now...later

       From an email I recently received    Take three minutes and read this-UK Daily Mirror article. No matter what your views on President Bush's statements about an upcoming war, this piece, from an English journalist, is very interesting. Just a word of background for those of you who aren't familiar with the United Kingdom's "Daily Mirror" newspaper. This notoriously left-wing journal normally is not supportive of the Colonials across the Atlantic. by Tony Parsons for the "Daily Mirror"...    September 11, 2002  One year ago, the world witnessed a unique kind of broadcasting - the mass murder of thousands, live on television. As a lesson in the pitiless cruelty of the human race, September 11 was up there with Pol Pot's Mountain of Skulls in Cambodia, or the skeletal bodies stacked like garbage in the Nazi concentration camps. An unspeakable act so cruel, so calculated and so utterly merciless that surely the world could agree on one thing-nobody deserves this fate. Surely there could be consensus: The victims were truly innocent, the perpetrators truly evil. But to the world's eternal shame, 9/11 is increasingly seen as America's comeuppance. Incredibly, anti-Americanism has increased over the last year. There has always been a simmering resentment to the USA in this country [England]; too loud, too rich, too full of themselves, and so much happier than Europeans--but it has become an epidemic. And that seems incredible to me. More than that, it turns my stomach. America is this country's greatest friend and our staunchest ally. We are bonded to the US by culture, language and blood. A little over half a century ago, around half a million Americans died for our freedoms, as well as their own. Have we forgotten so soon? And exactly a year ago, thousands of ordinary men, women and children--not just Americans, but from dozens of countries--were butchered by a small group of religious fanatics. Are we so quick to betray these victims? What touched the heart about those who died in the Twin Towers and on the planes, was that we recognized them. Young fathers and mothers, somebody's son and somebody's daughter, husbands, wives and children, some unborn. And these people brought it on themselves? Their nation is to blame for their meticulously planned slaughter? These days you don't have to be some dust-encrusted nut job in Kabul or Karachi or Finsbury Park to see America as the Great Satan. The anti-American alliance is made up of self-loathing liberals who blame the Americans for every ill in the Third World, and conservatives suffering from power-envy, bitter that the world's only superpower can do what it likes without having to ask permission. The truth is that America has behaved with enormous restraint since September 11. Remember...Remember...Remember...the gut-wrenching tapes of weeping men phoning their wives to say, "I love you," before they were burned alive. Remember those people leaping to their deaths from the top of burning skyscrapers. Remember the hundreds of firemen buried alive. Remember the smiling face of that beautiful little girl who was on one of the planes with her mum. Remember... remember... And realize that America has never retaliated for 9/11 in anything like the way it could have. So a few al-Al-Qaeda tourists got locked up without a trial in Camp X-ray? Pass the Kleenex. So some Afghan wedding receptions were shot up after they merrily fired their semiautomatics in a sky full of American planes? A shame but maybe next time they should stick to confetti. AMERICA could have turned a large chunk of the world into a parking lot. That it didn't is a sign of strength. American voices are already being raised against attacking Iraq--that's what a democracy is for. How many in the Islamic world will have a minute's silence for the slaughtered innocents of 9/11? How many Islamic leaders will have the guts to say that the mass murder of 9/11 was an abomination? When the news of 9/11 broke on the West Bank, those freedom-loving Palestinians were dancing in the street. America watched all of that--and America didn't push the button. We should thank the stars that America is the most powerful nation in the world. I still find it incredible that 9/11 did not provoke all-out war. Not a "war on terrorism." A real war. The fundamentalist dudes are talking about "opening the gates of hell" if America attacks Iraq. Well, America could have opened the gates of hell like you wouldn't believe. The US is the most militarily powerful nation that ever strode the face of the earth. The campaign in Afghanistan may have been less than perfect and the planned war on Iraq may be misconceived. But don't blame America for not bringing peace and light to these wretched countries. How many democracies are there in the Middle East, or in the Muslim world? You can count them on the fingers of one hand - assuming you haven't had any chopped off for minor shoplifting. I love America, yet America is hated. I guess that makes me Bush's poodle. But I would rather be a dog in New York City than a Prince in Riyadh. Above all, America is hated because it is what every country wants to be, rich, free, strong, open, optimistic. Not ground down by the past, or religion, or some caste system. America is the best friend this country ever had and we should start remembering that. Or do you really think the USA is the root of all evil? Tell it to the loved ones of the men and women who leaped to their death from the burning towers. Tell it to the nursing mothers whose husbands died on one of the hijacked planes, or were ripped apart in a collapsing skyscraper. And tell it to the hundreds of young widows whose husbands worked for the New York Fire Department. To our shame, George Bush gets a worse press than Saddam Hussein. Once we were told that Saddam gassed the Kurds, tortured his own people and set up rape-camps in Kuwait. Remember... remember... September 11th. One of the greatest atrocities in human history was committed against America. No, do more than remember:  Never forget.

       Hey, I'm back...  St. Patrick's Day was a complete blast and I hope to post pictures on The Convolution shortly.  Patrick can you send me those pics and pics from Michelle's party?  Thanks!  Yes, the week-long vacation is over and now it's back to the grind....but just for a month and then I am off for another week.  Pearl Jam in a little over three weeks away.  Can't wait for that!   Boycott  Well, at first I thought it was childish and didn't accomplish anything but now I am very mad after seeing  urlLink this story  that came over the wire recently!!  I'm beginning to change my tune because of this.   Oh Calvin  One thing I thought I'd never see is  urlLink Calvin Klein going after a professional basketball player .  Maybe the end of the world isn't too far off after all!!   One more thing  I'll be the first to say that it will be just a matter of time before rappers begin to use the phrase   shock and awe   in their raps.  Oh, I can just hear it now..............You better run y'all, before I start to go shock 'n' awe.........

But instead of going into it like I have already via emails, I'll just post a nice link to the mp3s of the  urlLink Oklahoma City show  on April 3rd.  Make sure you have a cable modem connection, they don't like dial up modems to clog up their server!!

       Can you believe it?   Philadelphia sports' teams are coming up huge during the final stretch of their respective seasons and the another team is getting off on the right foot.  The  Flyers  are now a point away from the  urlLink top spot in the Atlantic division .  This is a big deal as many know.  If they stay under the Devils, they will have to contend with the solid Maple Leafs but if they finish first, they'll play the less-skilled Boston Bruins.  I'll take the Bruins over the Maple Leafs any day of the week.  The  Sixers  are just a  urlLink half a point separated  from the faltering-of-late but still #1 in the Atlantic Division, New Jersey Nets.  Also, now they are just two points away from the top team of the East, the Detroit Pistons.  The Sixers have an almost equal chance of playing either the Bucks, the Magic, or the Celtics.  I'm not sure who I'd want to play but I probably would go with the Bucks.  Now the  Phillies ...oh the Phillies.  Way too early to speculate but when the Phillies are 2 and 0 and the Braves are 0 and 2 and in last place, that's always good in my book!   New Soprano  From  Eonline.com:   Steve Buscemi in talks to play a recurring character on The Sopranos for the next two seasons and to direct several episodes. The series began shooting its fifth season March 24.    Tim says:  NICE!!  Buscemi can become and pretty much IS an incredibly creepy guy, just see  Fargo  or  Con Air  or  Billy Madison  or.....the list goes on....

       Mr. Wiesak Goes to New York   Hey guys.  As you know, Tom Wiesak loves the music industry and has always sought after a career in the music/recording industry.  I'm not sure if you know, Tom, for all intents and purposes, has lost interest in his current job and has done some soul searching.  So he wanted me to make an all around announcement for him instead of the impersonal mass email.  After some thinking, and we all know that his thinking takes a LONG time, he has decided to pursue this dream of his.  He has searched and searched available jobs at record companies that he admires, i.e. Def Jam and Murder Inc.  (Seriously, he believes Russell Simmons is one of the greatest businessmen in the music industry).  However, these jobs were few and far between so he decided to go a different direction and found this available  urlLink job at New Line Cinema.   As you probably know, Tom's current job requires skills revolving around navigating around MS Office and more specifically, working with databases on an EXCEL platform.  Anyway, you'll see that this job that Tom has found at NLC requires much of these same skills.  This obviously isn't exactly what Tom is looking for but it is a very big step toward his ultimate goal which is basically setting up the logistics that are necessary to either A. Promotion of an up and coming band/artist or B. Promotion of a CD from an already established band.  Suffice it to say, Tom didn't have all the skills mentioned in the Job Posting but from what Tom told me, they actually liked his enthusiasm of the music/theatre industry and more importantly were impressed from his database skills and knowledge of SQR.  Cutting to the chase, Tom GOT THE JOB!!!  Congrats to Tommy W.  He's actually leaving for the big city of NYC(specifically Manhattan) in late April so I'll be home and will be having a goodbye party for him at my parent's place(they'll be in Ireland).  Wish him congrats at twiesak@hotmail.com.

       From the head article in the London Times...     “YANKEE bastard,” yelled the young British peacenik at the first American tank to roll up to the Palestine Hotel. “Go home.”   She picked a man who had waited for 576 days to give his answer. Marine First Lieutenant Tim McLaughlin leant from the turret of his Abrams tank — nickamed “Satan’s Right Hand” — and screamed back: “I was at the Pentagon September 11. My co-workers died. I don’t give a f***.”     A Great Headline from Daily News    urlLink The headline picture...

It's more like a high percentage of Mexicans and they're cool 'cause they can play soccer really well.

       Bob Crane-Colonel Hogan  So I just saw the movie,  urlLink Auto Focus , now out on video.  It's about the professional life of Bob Crane, Hogan from the 1960 TV series, Hogan's Heroes.  I highly recommend this movie.  Greg Kinnear pulls off a great Bob Crane and Willem Dafoe plays Crane's best friend.  Kinnear plays a man early on in the movie torn between a moral life or a life filled with sex and infidelity. You then see him sink more and more to a very unstable life.  Dafoe, although a person who plays Crane's best friend John Carpenter, seems to really portray Crane's conscious.  Go out and rent this movie....it's definitely a movie that a guy and a girl can enjoy!  Steve Beauparlant, I want you to rent this movie and give a review by next Monday!   Phone Booth  Yep, just saw this movie at the theatre.  I'm not trying to step on Steve's movie review page but since I just saw three movies in a matter of 15 hours, I had to put something down on paper.  I have to give this movie a B verging on B- status.  I'm not sure, maybe it's because I like more locations in a movie but I got bored during this movie.  The movie pretty much revolves around this one phone booth and we don't go anywhere else. It bores the senses a bit.  Again, just like in Daredevil, Colin Farrel carries the movie on his shoulder.  I'd wait to see this movie on video.   Out of left field  Here's an  urlLink mp3  of U2's performance of "The Hands that Built America" from the Oscars....  From  urlLink Batman-on-Film ... To give you a head's up,  Chris Nolan  is the person who directed the incredible,  Memento (if you haven't seen Memento, go see it now!)   Nolan to do THE FRIGHTENING, rewritten by Goyer!  Wednesday, April 2, 2003: I can't say who this source is, but trust me, this is legit, OK? According to this source, Chris Nolan has decided to go with the BATMAN: THE FRIGHTENING and it will be rewritten by David Goyer. This individual tells BOF that with rewrites, sometimes it is totally changed, while other times it stays pretty close to the original script. Now, the script that I read--and that got loose all over the net--was pretty darn good. Good concept, but it was clearly a sequel to the previous four Bat-films. And it has been indicated to me that Nolan plans to restart the series and go with a new continuity. So I guess you can safely assume that The Scarecrow will be the villian in the next Bat-film. I am still looking into this, so keep checking here at BATMAN ON FILM for the latest Bat-movie news!

       What a complete d*ck   Hopefully Scott Peterson will soon meet judgement day soon.  An excerpt from cnn.com   "He was in San Diego, near the [Mexican] border ... perhaps since he was aware of the fact that there was surveillance that he might try to run," the attorney general said.   "Driving up and down the freeway, he was aware of surveillance teams,  was waving at them and being kind of a smart aleck , and so they finally decided that they ought to just pull him in," Lockyer said, adding that police had followed Scott "for a number of days, maintaining surveillance, wiretaps on phones, trackers on vehicles to try to accumulate the evidence."

      Ok, not too much going on...   Matrix in all its glory  From  Eonline.com :  BIG PICTURE: The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions to be released as IMAX features this spring and fall when the sequel movies hit theaters.    There is no doubt I will see both of these flicks in the IMAX theatre, that would incredibly kick some nice arse.   Latest Bat news   To setup this quote from somebody in the know (taken from batman-on-film.com).  Ok so Chris Nolan, who directed Memento, will be taking on another movie before tackling Batman 5 which leads to this quote;   "Don't read anything into Chris Nolan doing another film before starting 'Batman.' This was something he intended to do all along and will work on it while Goyer is scripting the 'Batman' project. Besides, the studio [Warner Brothers] is intent on releasing 'Superman' first, "Batman' will follow. 2005 is likely the year the studio is targeting a 'Batman' release."     Dixie Exposure  Ok, so the Dixie Chicks have made a supposed unpatriotic remark a few weeks ago pretty much saying they are not proud that Bush is from thier home state.  (personally, Tim doesn't think they made an unpatriotic remark but they should have made the statement on U.S. soil for it takes more balls to do it on this side of the Atlantic and I would have more respect for them).  Anyway, now they are now using thier savvy spin skills and reversing the reverberations in their favor!!  Check out this new  urlLink cover for Entertainment Weekly!   Pearl Jam in a few days, Sixers Win, Flyers Win, Phillies over .500.........ahh, Good Times.

       It's been a while....  Ok, I did a pretty big update at the  urlLink OLD CONVOLUTION !  Actually, when it comes right down to it, it probably won't seem like  a big update.  But it took a long time to put everything together.  It's now 4AM and I started at 1AM.  Pictures, yes pictures!   The eye of God  This  urlLink celestial image  is spooky but incredible.   Busy workweek  I'm sure nobody cares, but I had one of the busiest workweeks at the Weather Channel.  There were more than 300 reports of tornadoes from May 4th to the 10th last week.  Severe weather was continually on-going and spread over a good portion of the U.S.  The brightspot came on Sunday morning when I was interviewed by ABCNEWS...that was pretty cool.  I think my interview was on newsradio stations across the country but I didn't get to hear it, I was sound asleep.   At the movies  I got to see  Xmen2  and I loved every bit of it.  Bryan Singer is following in the footsteps of Tim Burton as one of the best comicbook adaptation directors.  He really knows the core of the story surrounding the Xmen.  It's not just about their powers but also about racism and segregation.  I'm already getting excited for the Phoenix Saga in  Xmen3 !!!  Also getting very excited to see  Matrix Reloaded .  After seeing the trailer before Xmen2, I was completely blown away.  I didn't think they would be able to top the original but it looks like they did.  I really want to see  Bend it Like Beckham  and finally it's on the movie screen here in my local area. I've heard about this movie almost a year ago and only now has it come to the bigscreen.   Ok, must go to bed......g'night.

       On the road again  My roommate is selling her house so that leaves me with the task of finding a new place to live.  I’ll likely be in a new place by July 1st.  I’ll update you with a new address and phone number when I get them.   DVD player  Yep, I finally got one!  It’s about time I guess.  My first purchase was the  U2 Elevation tour  dvd and also a movie called  urlLink Comedian  starring Jerry Seinfeld.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  Gives a look into what it takes to perform as a stand up comic through a rookie’s eyes(Orny Adams) and as an established comic(Seinfeld).     Saw and heard  I saw the movie Bend It Like Beckham urlLink   and I recommend this movie as well although I’d probably wait for it to come out on video.  I guess you can’t really go wrong with hot girls in soccer uniforms.  As Martha Stewart would say, “it’s a good thing.”  Shows how a girl can overcome cultural differences and misguided family values in order to pursue her goals in life.    I also just got Third Eye Blind’s new album called  urlLink Out of the Vein  and I have to say I really enjoy this album.  It’s very poppy and it’s a very good “sing in the car” album.  No, I don’t like Mr. Jenkins but after four years, they did put a pretty damn good album out there.    Gonna see Matrix today.  Should be good!    More updates at the  urlLink Old Convolution  coming shortly!

This  urlLink picture was taken some time ago  in early November of 2001 but I just liked it 'cause it showed the eastern third of the U.S. so clearly.  Thought I had more to say today but that's about it...it's 5 in the morning and haven't slept a wink yet and still not tired.  Time to dance to Hungry Like a Wolf by Duran Duran.  Actually, one last thing before I go, O.A.R.'s new album is AWESOME!!  Definitely try to check it out.  I'd have to say Dareh Meyod is my favorite off the album.

       We started making faces at the senoritas...   O.A.R.  is coming out with their major label debut this Tuesday(May 27th) with their album,  urlLink In Between Now and Then .  You can follow that link to VH1 to listen to some cuts from the album.  If you don't know who O.A.R is then shame on you.  Get your act together, put your priorities in place!  Anyway, this cd also comes with a DVD documentary.  They say it's a limited edition DVD but I have gotten cd's that are accompanied with a dvd well after their release and still got the dvd so no worries on hurrying.  O.A.R. will be on Conan O'Brien(the best late night talk show host out there) on June 18th so don't miss 'em!  And if you live in the Philly area, they'll be at Tower Records(610 South Street) on May 30th!  Very cool of them....they'll play some songs and sign CD's.  Steve Beau, you gonna be there?   Pat McGee Band fan?  If you are, here's the latest from Pat himself from their official website:  We just finished up a short two-week tour of the Midwest, deep south and northeast, and now we spend the next few months working on the post-production of the new record (not yet titled). The new record is being mixed in LA at the end of May and is tentatively scheduled for a late summer release (keep your fingers crossed) on Warner Brothers. From the ruff versions that I have heard, the record is sounding pretty sick. We all can't wait for you guys to check it out. Even though this new record is  a studio recording, it really captures the energy of PMB live. It has a very alive feeling to it.  The month of June will be spent on the planning and art side of the album. Of course we will keep you posted on the release, once we have official word for WB. Once the record is out, we will tour nonstop to every corner of the US (yes, the West coast too) and then onward to other countries, most likely sometime next year.    Pearl Jam Guitarist Goes Public with Crohn's  It's a pretty serious, painful, and embarrasing disease.....and not to make light of the situation, but there are a few really funny quotes from Mike himself about the times that Crohn's kicked in during concerts.   NEW YORK (Billboard) - Some rock stars run offstage into the arms of a beautiful woman, but Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready often finds himself running ... right to the bathroom.        McCready, 37, has suffered for more than 15 years from the debilitating stomach disorder Crohn's disease. He went public with his story May 13, when he spoke at the Northwest Chapter of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America's (CCFA) third annual Many Faces of Hope luncheon in Seattle.    McCready only summoned the courage to speak publicly about his disease after meeting last fall with other Crohn's sufferers.    "The stories they told me were far worse than what I've experienced," he says. "One kid was 14 and had had six surgeries and still wasn't cured. I wanted to put myself out there and say, 'I've had a career in spite of Crohn's disease.' I learned from these kids, and that gives me a lot of strength and hope."    Researchers are not sure what causes Crohn's, and there is no cure. Patients are subjected to an extensive regimen of medication and must constantly monitor their diet.    McCready takes three different drugs and has been in remission for about eight months. "It is such a strange disease," he says. "You can do everything possible that you think is right, and it can still come back."    During his speech, the artist related a particularly embarrassing incident to demonstrate how Crohn's can strike at any time. "Playing onstage, I'm always aware of where the bathrooms are," he admits. "When Crohn's hits, I have to run, or it won't be pretty. It happened when we opened up for the Rolling Stones in 1997 in Oakland .    "It was our first show with them," McCready continues. "Five minutes before we went on, I went up to (Pearl Jam frontman) Eddie (Vedder) and I said, 'Look man, can we play 'Sometimes'? -- which is a slower song that I'm not really on. I was in pain. I went running offstage looking for a bathroom, and there wasn't one. Then, all of a sudden, there was one. It was a honeybucket. I heard my band play that song from inside a portable toilet!"    McCready says he is lucky to have the support of his bandmates, all of whom were on hand for his speech. (The group resumes its summer North American tour May 28 in Missoula, Mont.) Indeed, some proceeds from Pearl Jam's Seattle shows last December were donated to the CCFA, and McCready plans to remain active with the Northwest chapter of the organization.    Two days after his address, McCready played a CCFA charity concert with his side band, the Rockfords. "Crohn's can be humiliating and restricting," McCready says. "But getting in touch with an organization like CCFA has allowed me to begin dealing with those negatives in a positive way."

       Ed Burns   Well, Ed just got married this past weekend to Christy Turlington but more importantly, I just saw his movie,  urlLink Confidence .  It came out in late April but I don't think anybody knows about this movie!  It stars Ed Burns, Rachel Weisz, Andy Garcia, and Dustin Hoffman....and alot of other actors that you would recognize.  Anyway, if you like "Lock, stock, and two smoking barrels" and "Snatch" then you will definitely like this movie just the same.  I think the general humor and story is better in "Snatch" but "Confidence" holds its own especially with Dustin Hoffman's performance.  That guy is good.  Just thought I'd let you know about this movie that nobody knows about!   PNW   A  urlLink cool photo of the Pacific Northwest  shows Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, and Victoria, B.C. as well as the Cascades and the Olympic Mountains!  Very cool shot just taken last week.  By the way, all last week, cities in the PAC NW were breaking record high temperatures left and right including Portland and Seattle.  Temps were in the high 80s and low to mid 90s......that's unusual for them.  They've stolen all the heat away from the Northeast.   Nothing else really new....   Just gonna be moving into new apartment on June 24th give or take a few days.  The cool thing is that it's only two minutes literally from work.  I'm thinking about biking it to work.....

       Really, really big hail   Check out the  urlLink Old Convolution  for a satellite photo of impressive looking cloud features over SE Nebraska and read what fell out of those clouds!   The Hulk   Damn, this movie was quite.....well......boring.  Don't get me wrong, the acting in this movie(esp. from Nick Nolte) is really good.  I also really wanted to like this movie but I found myself struggling to keep my eyes open.  Ang Lee, the director, creates a movie that probably is too "high brow" and too smart for comic book fans.  The dialogue between characters went on and on and was drawn out.  You almost wanted to say, "get to the action already!"  Even with the overextended dialogue, I found myself still trying to figure out the progress of the film.  For instance, you expect the Hulk's first tranformation from Bruce Banner to the Hulk to be of significant cause and effect factors.  Something completely over the top forces Banner to go over the edge!  But that doesn't happen.  Before you know it, the first transformation of Banner into the Hulk occurs and you are left wondering, what set him off?  What put him over the edge?  Anyway, it's a video movie IMO.  Wait for July 2nd and the Rise of the Machines!  Woo hoo!  Can't wait.

       Vedder Up!   Eddie Vedder visited the Phillies this past weekend....here's the blurb from phillyburbs.com:   Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder, in town for two weekend shows at the Tweeter Center, visited the Phillies before yesterday's game. Among Vedder's activities: batting and fielding practice and a mini clubhouse guitar lesson for Lieberthal, who had his own instrument autographed, "To Mike," by the singer. Lieberthal appreciated the tips but said of Vetter's baseball prospects: "He's better off in music." And of Vedder's physical stature: "He's smaller than I thought."     Latest Bat news   If any of you are interested, Ashton Kutcher has been in the rumorville as he's been said as being the best prospect for the new Batman movie.  Now I think Ashton is a good actor but in no way should he be involved in the Batman movies!!    First of all remember that Chris Nolan has already been hired by WB to direct this movie.  He's the man who directed the movie  Memento .....a very underrated movie.  So Nolan has some power in who he wants to cast and direct.  After visiting  urlLink www.batman-on-film.com , I read this supposed latest news on the progress of the new movie.  Good news if you don't want Ashton to be the next Batman!!   Kutcher will NOT be Cast as Bruce Wayne. Nolan want's an unknown, He thinks Kutcher comes with too much baggage (Dude Where's My Car?, That 70's Show).   He thinks Kutchers antics as of late to try and gain publicity nods and attention (dating Demi) is uncalled for and pathetic.   Apparently Nolan told Kutchers camp that he would consider him for the part if he started acting like Mature Hollywood and less like the idiot he plays on That 70's Show. He doesn't think that Kutcher would suit the needs of the BATMAN audience, the way that Clooney/Kilmer did, and even though Nolan wants "Young Hollywood" in the next Batman flick, he said that Kutcher just doesn't fit the part, nor will he ever.   When Nolan told Ashton's camp he needed to be more mature, he didn't mean to grab an older more respected Actress in Hollywood and try to "Date" her. The Demi Moore/Ashton Kutcher "Romance" is a publicity stunt, One which will not score Kutcher the part in the new Batman Flick.   Other Batman News: Al Gough will be the only Original cast member to Return (Gough of course plays the part of Alfred Pennyworth). Christopher Lloyd has been chosen to play the part of the evil villain Dr. Jonathan Crane (AKA "The Scarecrow"). These are the only two cast members attached to the project thus far, and I can guarantee that Ashon Kutchers name will not be included in the credits when the film finally does hit theaters. Collin, who?   -anonymous    Again, this was posted on batman-on-film and written by someone possibly close to the making of the new movie....we'll see I guess!   MER   The second half of the Mars Exploration Rover(named Opportunity) has just been launched on Monday night at 11:18PM(just a few hours ago from me writing this).  You can follow the MER's trip through space  urlLink via this link !   These Picked-On Kids   I don't  urlLink understand these kids  that feel they have to enact revenge on other kids who pick on them.  They feel they have to build up an artillery cache enough for a small army and take out their anger by killing their supposed bullies.  Well fuck you assholes!  Stop feeling sorry for yourself you selfish brats.  Yeah, you can wear your black clothes in order to feel like you aren't conforming...that's all fine and good.  But instead of feeling sorry for yourself and evoke an attitude of "oh....I'll get you one day....you'll wait and see" maybe you should turn it around and make it something positive for yourself!  This guy, Matthew Lovett, dude....you're like 6 feet tall.  Use this to your advantage and start lifting weights or something.  Create a presence about yourself that won't allow you to be picked on!  If you're 6 feet tall and built, there won't be too much more bullying and picking-on anymore from fellow students.  They'll think twice.  Instead you resort to staying inside, exert in no physical activities and draw up plans to take the lives of others.  That is just sad.  Now you have more time in jail to feel sorry for yourself.......later dude.  At least you get a new wardrobe now.

       Second day of STP news   From Blabbermouth.net: STONE TEMPLE PILOTS: Greatest Hits Collection, DVD To Surface In November - Aug. 19, 2003     STONE TEMPLE PILOTS will be releasing a "greatest hits" album, tentatively titled "Thank You", on November 4 through Atlantic Records. The album will feature 14 of the bands hit songs, plus an acoustic version of "Plush" and a new track called "All In The Suit That You Wear". The greatest hits set will draw from STP's five albums: "Core" (1992), "Purple" (1994), "Tiny Music - Songs From the Vatican Gift Shop" (1996), "No. 4" (1999) and "Shangri-La De Da" (2001). In addition, the group will issue a DVD containing all of the band's music videos and about an hour of other live performances and photos, as well as some "home" footage the band has shot over the years. The CD will be available separately or as a CD/DVD package, according to the band's web site. In 2000, the group had planned to release a hits compilation called "Big Bang Babies" but scrapped the record after a management shakeup.

       Is Paul Dead?  A pretty  urlLink comprehensive site  detailing why Paul McCartney is really dead.   They're on the cover...  ...of  urlLink Rolling Stone !  I guess RS will put on anybody on the cover these days!  That being said, they sure do look good!   Another bad way...  ...to go.  We now know to stay away from coasters and  urlLink elevators !   Is Stone Temple Pilots over?  Seems Scott has focused more on  urlLink Velvet Revolver  more than STP in recent months.   I also heard that Weiland and Velvet Revolver were in the same studio building that the Deleo Brothers were in a few months back.  According to Slash, Scott and the Deleo Bros. didn't make an effort to say "hi" to each other even though they were separated by only a few rooms over.  Not good news fo STP fans!

Ok, maybe I'm wrong.  I just looked up Jaguar in the dictionary and there are two separate pronunciations...  jag-war and jag-yoo-ar   Either way, it's still stupid to pronounce it jaguuuuuuwhar!!

       Savannah Trip (Aug 22, 23)   Left with Chris and Rory for Savannah on Fri afternoon at 1pm.  Got down to Savannah at around 4:30 and checked into the hotel. Drank about 3 or 4 beers then traveled the streets of Savannah.  For some reason, Chris knew way too much about Savannah and was pointing out all the landmarks around town. He read the book, Midnight in the Garden of Eden or something like that which takes place in Savannah.  We also saw the town square and park bench where Forest Gump was shot at.  Not physically shot with a gun but the filming of the movie.  Although, Gump was shot in the movie....right in the but-tox sir.  Came back to the hotel, had a few more drinks then met up with my friend Jeff and his girlfrind who live in Savannah.  We headed out to dinner around 7:30 to a seafood place.  Mmm, mmm good buffalo shrimp.  I now know buffalo shrimp is not large shrimp but actually spicy shrimp.  I thought because buffalo rhymed with jumbo that they were one in the same.  I was sadly mistaken.  This, by the way, all takes place along the river on Riverside street (portions of the street are covered in original cobblestones).  Restaurants, pubs, and shops are all along the Savannah river.  Anyway, while eating dinner, we noticed the street performers across the street.  One dude was on a unicycle who juggled, did tricks, and played with the audience.  Then another group of performers were breakdancers.  They were amazing.  I took pictures of all of this so I'll get them posted eventually.  Anyway, drinking then continued until 3am and we were up Sat. morning at around 11am 'cause that was checkout time. I was hurtin' but got some pizza and water in me and i was doing good after that.  We headed to Tybee Island which was amazing.  Water was around 72-75 degrees.  I've never been in ocean water that warm before.  Was out there for 2 and a half hours and put on 30 sunblock.  (by the way, I have realized that 15 and 30 sunblock do just the same as 45 or 75 or 95 block).  I missed however some portions of my right side and have a big red welt on my side now.  Doesn't hurt though.  So that's about it.  We pretty much took off for home right after Tybee Island.   Played soccer on Sunday night and we actually have a good team.  We won 6-1. Looking forward to the season.

Miles: You have kids?  Buck: No I don't.  Miles: How come?  Buck: It's an even longer story.  Miles: Are you my Dad's brother?  Buck: What's your record for consecutive questions asked?  Miles: 38.  Buck: I'm your Dad's brother alright.  Miles: You have much more hair in your nose than my Dad.  Buck: How nice of you to notice.  Miles: I'm a kid - that's my job.

Sports   Phils out of Wild Card Race by a game.  Damn Marlins keep on winning.  Braves play Marlins 7 times in the next 10 days.  I'll have to be a Brave fan for the next several days.  Eagles season is not lost.  They have 15 more games to go.  I can't be pessimistic, they went up against probably the best team in the NFL.  Let Donovan run!!  Defense looked good, I am not worried about that aspect.  Penn State?  Oh man, JoePa, let Austin Scott run the damn ball and allow MROB to become more of an offensive presence.  Scott and MROB are the key to a winning season.  That being said,  Nebraska will avenge their devestating loss to PSU last year.  Nebraska will win and cover the spread.

       Weiland Divorces   From Eonline.com:   DIVORCING: Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland filed for divorce Tuesday from his wife Mary, less than two months after a failed attempt at reconciliation. The couple married on May 22, 2000 and separated on September 19, 2002. Mary Weiland filed for divorce two days later, but subsequently dropped the case.      More STP news:    From STP.com    A special edition of Stone Temple Pilots' upcoming Atlantic best-of set, "Thank You," will include a DVD packed with three hours of videos, live performances and footage of the band shot by friends and fans. Due Nov. 11, the 15-track audio anthology will be available with and without the DVD.   The DVD will feature clips for 32 songs, including such hits as "Interstate Love Song," "Sex Type Thing" and "Vasoline." Highlights include a rendition of the Aerosmith classic "Sweet Emotion" with the band's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry and run through Glen Campbell's "Wichita Lineman" with the artist.  As previously reported, the tracks on the "Thank You" audio disc survey the band's five studio albums, which have sold a combined 12 million copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. The set boasts the new song "All in the Suit You Wear," which can be sampled on the band's official Web site.  As a group, STP has been more or less dormant in the last year. Singer Scott Weiland, who has publicly battled addiction through a series of arrests and stints in rehab, has most recently been involved with the band Velvet Revolver. Rounded out by former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum plus Suicidal Tendencies' David Kushner, the band is eyeing a February release for its debut RCA album.  STP bassist Robert DeLeo and his guitarist brother Dean produced Alien Ant Farm's latest album, "truANT." Released in August, the set debuted at No. 42 on The Billboard 200.  Here is the "Thank You" audio CD track list:   "Vasoline" "Down" "Wicked Garden" "Big Empty" "Plush" "Big Bang Baby" "Creep" "Lady Picture Show" "Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart" "Interstate Love Song" "In the Suit That You Wear" "Sex Type Thing" "Days of the Week" "Sour Girl" "Plush" (acoustic)  Here is the "Thank You" DVD track list:   "Dead & Bloated" "Army Ants" "Interstate Love Song" "Silvergun Superman" "Crackerman" "Plush" "Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart" "Hollywood Bitch" "Big Empty" "Long Way Home" "Down" "Meat Plow" "Tumble in the Rough" "Sex & Violence" "Wicked Garden" "Atlanta" "Where the River Goes" "Pop's Love Suicide" "Sweet Emotion" "Big Bang Baby" "Pretty Penny" "Lounge Fly" "Wonderful" "Creep" "Too Cool Queenie" "Wichita Lineman" "Sex Type Thing" "Vasoline" "Lady Picture Show" "Sour Girl" "Days of the Week" "Hello, It's Late"

       An Irish Joke I just found:   A Irishman goes to his first baseball game. At one point someone bunts the ball down the third baseline. Everyone shouts RUN!RUN!RUN! So he says "RUN ya basterd run!" A few innings later someone is walked. He starts shouting "RUN ya basterd run!" He then wonders why everyone is laughing at him. Then someone said "He doesn't have to run, he has four balls" then the Irish mans says " Then walk with pride Man!"

       Weiland Can't Keep it Together   Rocker Weiland Arrested After Hollywood Car Crash Wed Oct 29, 6:14 PM ET  Add Entertainment - Reuters to My Yahoo!   LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Days after a judge warned him to stay off drugs, ill-starred rocker Scott Weiland (news) marked his 36th birthday by crashing into a parked car in Hollywood and leaving the scene, Los Angeles police said on Wednesday.   The former singer with chart-topping rock band Stone Temple Pilots was quickly arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence following the incident, which happened early Monday morning. He was released later that day after posting $15,000 bail.   Los Angeles Police Dept. spokesman Officer Jason Lee (news) said the charge carries an additional request for hit-and-run on account of Weiland's alleged failure to stop after hitting the car with his BMW. Damage to both cars was moderate, Lee said.   He is scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles Municipal Court on Nov. 17. A spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney said a charge of one count of driving under the influence would probably be filed later today.    The details of the incident were first reported by music news Web site blabbermouth.net. A spokeswoman for Weiland's current band, Velvet Revolver, declined to comment.   Weiland has a long history of inter-related drug and legal problems. Most recently, he entered a no-contest plea to two felony drug possession charges in August, and was ordered to enter a drug counseling program. He has completed most of the requirements, and on Oct. 20 a Pasadena judge allowed him to remain free as long as he stayed clean.   In 1999, he served five months of an 11-month jail sentence in connection with an arrest for heroin possession the year before. Weiland's problems contributed to the demise of Stone Temple Pilots. His new band, Velvet Revolver, which includes former members of Guns N' Roses, is recording its debut album.     TV Specials Coming in November for Sweeps    Note from me...

I nearly cried with laughter at how bad these critics absolutely trounced the film!!  The final quote from a critic is one of the best I've ever seen.   Movies that are fantastic you ask?  Well, go see  Master and Commander .  Russell Crowe, in my opinion, may go down as the best actor of our time when everything is said and done....better than Hanks, Cruise, Nicholson, etc....

       Why Hockey Players are the toughest athletes....   From last night's game vs. Columbus:   COLUMBUS, Ohio - A minute and 32 seconds remained in the second period when Donald Brashear missed a check, and his stick caught Flyers teammate Sami Kapanen flush in the mouth and bloodied him.  Kapanen went down, losing two teeth and shattering two others.  "Not a lot of pain, but I felt like I had a mouthful of sand," the winger said.  Some players would have called it a night. Kapanen didn't. He came back in the third period to score his first goal in 11 games, pulling out a 1-1 tie for the Flyers against the Columbus Blue Jackets tonight at Nationwide Arena.

       Katie Holmes in next Bat-flic k   Inside Move: Holmes may join 'Batman'  Helmer likely to cast 'April' star after read-through  By MICHAEL FLEMING, CATHY DUNKLEY   Warner Bros. is zeroing in on Katie Holmes for the female lead of its next "Batman" film.  Holmes has been offered the role, subject to a screen test with Christian Bale that will be conducted by director Christopher Nolan. While Nolan considered many young actresses to play Batman's love interest Rachel, Holmes is the only actress who will do a screen test. It is considered likely that a deal will follow shortly after.   Holmes would be the third thesp cast. Nolan, who came aboard the film with his producing partner Emma Thomas, first set Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, and recently began negotiating with Michael Caine to play his butler, Alfred.   They've been mum about the storyline that was scripted by David Goyer, but WB and Nolan are gearing up for a 2004 start date and 2005 release of what had been the studio's most viable franchise until "The Matrix." WB exec Greg Silverman is the presiding Bat-exec.   While she is best known for "Dawson's Creek," the CAA-repped Holmes has quietly established herself on screen by working with such directors as Ang Lee, Curtis Hanson and Sam Raimi. She just opened in "The Singing Detective" and "Pieces of April," and she has been working on the Forest Whitaker-directed "First Daughter."     Dan Reeves Fired!!   Looks like Michael Vick will have a  urlLink new coach  from this point out....   Bobby hits Whitney!

       Stupid Eagles Stupid Stupid Eagles Stupid Stupid Eagles Stupid Stupid Eagles Stupid Stupid Eagles Stupid Stupid Eagles Stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Anyway, 23 years without a championship title in Philadelphia....(ignoring the Philadelphia Phantom's Calder Cup and a few Philadelphia Wing trophies in there as well).  It's just getting sad at this point.  Not enough energy to boo anymore.  It's to the point that we are nearing a Shakespearean Tragedy.  So completely and utterly frustrating.  Now the Sixers are back to average (can we please get another superstar to compliment A.I. please?).  The Flyers are more like puttering around instead of flying.  After an amazing start, now two defensive longterm injuries.....Desjardin's injury will hurt us badly.  Dare, I say, Phillies 2004!!!  I hope so.

       Satellite shot  This was taken on Feb 8th and shows the  urlLink snow-covered mtns.  of the Appalachians.   The WB...   ...has cancelled Angel!!!  NO!  You bunch of whankers.....   A statement from The WB:  For the last seven years Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer have been cornerstones of our network. The sum total of the work done on those shows has produced some of the proudest moments in our history. Like some of the great series that are leaving the air this year, including Frasier and Friends, the cast, crew, writers and producers of Angel deserve to be able to wrap up the series in a way befitting a classic television series and that is why we went to Joss to let him know that this would be the last year of the series on The WB. We have discussed continuing the Angel legacy with special movie events next year, which is still on the table. In a perfect world, all of these details would be completed before this information went to the press so that we could be definitive about the show's ongoing future. But in any case, we did not want to contemplate this being the last year of Angel without giving the show the option of crafting their own destiny for this character and for this series. David Boreanaz continues to be one of the finest, classiest and friendliest actors we have had the pleasure to work with and we hope that the relationship furthers from here. The same can be said for all the actors and producers on the show.     Stealing this website from a guy who does "web pick of the day" selections...   Here's an entire internet site dedicated to those who have only one eyebrow which stretches entirely across their foreheads.   Featuring the tagline: "Americans are pulling together, shouldn't your eyebrows?", the site offers games, video clips and too many pictures of people sporting that Cro-Magnon look.   It also features grooming tips for those who love their monobrow, as well as advice for those who want to separate them.   A lot of energy went into this site.

The last time I felt this way about a show was when Angel premiered 5 years ago...ok, maybe Smallville 3 years ago.

The spin is already emerging:   TIMES : It appeared to be the first confirmed finding of the sort of chemical weapons on which the United States built its case to go to war, according to Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.    (A non-proliferation expert pronounced "Some more!" Brilliant!)  Except for the fact that it's not really true or anywhere near the front page, and they have to quote an "expert" in London to confirm what simple observation would tell us, the whole story admittedly is rather spinless.   And spineless.  Below that:   It was detonated before it could be defused, producing "a very small dispersal" of the gas, he said.    Very small. Nothing to see here. Let's discuss Abu Ghraib for a change.  So the crowd that gets hysterical when a kid brings a toy gun to school, is pretty tolerant when just a "small" amount of WMDs are found. If a Costco warehouse filled with this stuff was found, THEN, it would matter, right?  But, it doesn't matter. The rules of playing Spin the Tale with the Donkey change everyday with each claim debunked. They hate America, they hate Bush, and the American people will see the contrast...or not...in November.    Shin Splints...    urlLink SUCK!!

       urlLink    So I finally picked up an Elvis album.  It was about damn time....it was way overdue.  I know I loved Elvis' Christmas songs such as "Blue Christmas" but I never had an album with all his hits.  Wow is all I can say.  Now I know why Elvis has so many fans worldwide.  After going through the album...I think my favorite is "It's Now or Never" recorded way back in April of 1960....what an album!!&nbsp; urlLink

Comments are definitely still muchly appreciated but with the new design unfortunately went the old comments that  SO MANY  of you made.  Hardy har har.  I'm also gonna experiment with a new photo upload service.  Maybe now, when I am referring to a picture, I can just upload to my site and not have to refer you to a URL.  Hopefully, this program  urlLink HELLO  will work out!

       THEY'RE LEGAL!    Olsen twins turn 18, giving dirty old men more fantasy fodder  By Dan Gross  grossd@phillynews.com   DROOL AWAY.  If you have the hots for the Olsen twins, you're no longer a total perv.  You're at least much less of one.  Because Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen turned 18 yesterday.  No doubt they celebrated, as did legions of men who have literally been counting the hours, minutes and seconds till their crossover to adulthood.  The former "Full House" TV stars have earned a loyal following of young girls for nearly a decade with videos like "Passport to Paris" and "You're Invited to Mary-Kate and Ashley's Ballet Party." But in recent years, Mary-Kate and Ashley have found new admirers among men old enough to be their fathers.  For a few years now, oodles of Web sites have counted down the seconds until the twins could legally be lusted after.  "Oh, boys will be boys," Mary-Kate has said of the phenomenon.  "We are not sexy," she told CBS' "48 Hours" last year. "Don't know how to explain it."  Dr. Joyce Brothers knows how to explain it.  "They have a clean image. Men want to defile the clean image," the psychologist said in a recent phone interview.  Men also want women to think they're good lovers, and according to Brothers, "the younger the girl is, the less she is going to have for comparison."  Y100 morning host Preston Elliot is a little more blunt.  "The whole twin thing is a lifelong goal for all perverted guys," said Elliot, 36. "Shamefully but proudly do I include myself in that."  And it doesn't hurt, he said, that "they're sexy, attractive girls. They're famous. They're billionaires."  Well, not quite billionaires, but they are rich. The Olsens, who will attend New York University in the fall, each have a fortune estimated by CNN at more than $150 million.  Elliot and co-host Steve Morrison, 45, considered holding a "Dirty Old Man" screening of "New York Minute," the Olsens' recently released, first feature film. But it turns out even dirty old men have standards.  "It just looked like a crappy movie," said Elliot of the movie, which flopped.  The guys did hold a screening for "Mean Girls," which stars 17-year-old Lindsay Lohan.  For those counting, Lohan crosses the jailbait line on July 2.  Q102 morning co-host Angi Taylor isn't turned on by the Olsens, but she admires them as "very intelligent businesswomen."  They certainly are.  When "Full House" ended in 1995, the then 9-year-olds - who had taken turns playing Michelle Tanner since they were 9 months old - created their own production company, Dualstar, along with their manager, Robert Thorne.  Since then, they've created an empire of straight-to-video releases, clothing, CDs, dolls, makeup, fragrances and even a magazine, all aimed at a core audience of pre-teen girls.  Speaking of "Full House," the twins' TV father, Mount Airy native Bob Saget, declined to be interviewed for this story.  Chase Brown, 22, of Michigan, started his online countdown "two or three years ago" after he saw people chatting online about the Olsens' birthday. He said he thought it would be funny.  Brown's site, chasebrown.com/olson.htm, not only misspells the girls' last name but includes a link to send Brown a donation to keep the site alive - something he says several hundred visitors from around the world have done. Brown also operates about 30 adult Web sites.  While he finds the twins too thin to be attractive, "I think most people would want to see them in Playboy.  "I know in the industry there's buzz about them."  Veteran porn director/actor Bill Margold disagrees.  "The only way they would do well is if they did each other," he said.  Brown recently launched hilaryduffcountdown.com to tick off the seconds until that actress's 18th birthday, Sept. 28, 2005.  Isn't it a little strange to pay so much attention to 14-, 15- or 16-year-old girls?  "I guess it's kind of weird," Brown admitted. "But it wasn't like, 'Oh yeah I can't wait till they're legal so I can morally masturbate to them.' I just thought it would be funny. It's all a big joke really."  If it is a joke, even the Olsens are in on it.  At the end of a recent "Saturday Night Live" they hosted, one twin reminded the audience, "We're legal in four weeks."  Said Brothers, "They're laughing it off, and laughing all the way to the bank."  Entertainment industry vets that they are, they probably know any publicity is good publicity.  Added Brothers, "They've grown up with it, they're totally comfortable with it and they're using it in positive ways."  Michelle Malkin doesn't think the Olsen obsession is positive, or funny.  "It's a sign of the acceptance of pedophilia chic that these men could run these sites and nobody condemns it," says the conservative and often controversial syndicated columnist, who appears in the Daily News.  "Someday when they have daughters, I hope they look back on what they do with these Web sites and feel ashamed of themselves."  The advertising industry has been sexualizing women at younger and younger ages since the 1980s, Malkin contended, though she also thinks the Olsens have maintained a wholesome image.  Taylor summed up Olsen lust as nothing more than harmless fantasy. "What do these guys think is gonna happen, the Olsens are gonna [turn 18 and] go trolling the streets of Philly looking for some guy?"  Still, she said, "It is a little twisted.  "You never hear a 16-year-old kid being like, 'Dude, they're gonna be 18!' It's always some 45-year-old fatass that's waiting for it."  Not anymore they're not.

       14 days and still questioning...   At one point, if you were a contestant on Jeopardy! and did very well day after day, you were limited to only about 5 appearances I beleive.  But now, they got rid of that restriction and it may have been just a tad too soon.  You see, there is this man named  urlLink Ken Jennings  from Utah who just keeps on winning.  On Monday, June 21st, he won yet again which marks his 14th day in a row that he has questioned his way to a victory.  Simply amazing.  His totals have added up to  $471,759 .  Remember to watch on your favorite local Jeopardy! channel to see if Ken can keep it going.

He had a book signing at the local Barnes and Noble just about 5 min away from my apartment.  I decided to go and get his book signed.  It was pretty cool and he was very nice.....good guy.&nbsp; urlLink

       It's been a while!   Took the trip back home and have a few pics that I'll post soon.  Saw the Phillies finally in their new ballpark, Amy and Chris's wedding was a blast, awesome barbecue at Patrick and Kendra's.   In the meantime...   Just saw  Spiderman 2  and was completely blown away by this movie.  All the spectacular reviews were dead on.  Loved this movie in every way and it is probably the best movie I've seen in quite some time.  The last time I was awed by a movie was Terminator 2 and this movie gave me that same type of feeling.  Spiderman 2 now ranks higher than X-Men 2 in my book.  This is one of those movies that I'll probably go back to see again and I never do that.   Ken Jennings   Still making history on  urlLink Jeopardy !!!!  Unbelievable....on his way to 1,000,000 dollars.   Weiland Update   Things are looking up for Scott especially with the release of Velvet Revolver's awesome album and forthcoming tour.  However, he has to deal with his past first before he can move on...here's a cut from Eonline.com...   Ex-Stone Temple Pilots and current Velvet Revolver frontman Scott Weiland sentenced Thursday in a DUI case. He was ordered to complete a stint in rehab, placed on three years' probation and ordered to play a $400 fine plus additional court fees.

       Really disturbing story coming out of Atlanta    urlLink Two young girls kill for love.   This story closely mimics the movie  urlLink "Heavenly Creatures"  with Kate Winslett....oddly enough directed by Peter Jackson (the guy who did the  Lord of the Rings  movies.  I recommend this movie by the way....disturbing as well....but very good.
