      and speaking of quests, i often wonder when would the quest for the perfect job end?  =)

      have you ever gone on a quest for something?  i have.  as a matter of fact, i think i've gone to a handful.  quest for the perfect ballpoint pen. quest for the perfect gel pen. quest for the perfect sign pen. quest for the perfect eraser. quest for the perfect iced tea. quest for the perfect garlic mushrooms. quest for the perfect fries. quest for the perfect burger. quest for the perfect jeans. quest for the perfect ponytail holder. quest for the perfect boots. quest for the perfect body lotion. quest for the perfect perfume. quest for the perfect undies. quest for the perfect sisig. a handful really.  and you know the most fun part of going on these quests?  it's not finding the perfect pen or jeans or body lotion or garlic mushrooms.  because if we'd find the perfect whatever, what then?  it would be a very boring consumer-driven life don't you think?

      hmmm....  what to write, what to write...  i have so many going on in my mind that i do not know where to start.  i just read this article by joey ayala, sort of a comparison between manila and mindanao.  really, i envy people who grew up in the province, specifically far-flung places.  having grown up in a very urban area, being in the province, surrounded by everything rustic and countrified has always been appealing.  there is something in rural places which i find surreal and fantastic.  there is something about those really old churches and monuments, with the gray surface and peeling paint.  it seems that everything around you is deep-rooted and has its own mystery, its own story.  it's like going back in time.  like being in a dream.  like becoming a child again.

      i got this email from an old friend who's based in san diego for four years now.  here goes:  "Hey! Mukhang busy ka dyan. Anyways, what's going on there? What's your gimik this coming weekend? Well, me, i'm kindda busy with work.  Nakakatamad na nga dito eh. War is closing in. It's probably on by these week or next week. We just gotta do what we got to do you know. Anyways, i really miss everything there. I mean alam ko we aint that close but we have our short share of memories. Short but meaningful. Take care nalang and keep up the good work. It's really good to see that you are doing great with everything. -- ERIC!!!!"  there's nothing really infuriating than someone who's so pro-america.  and he wasn't even born and raised there.  but funny.  it's not the land of milk and honey.  really.  sana wala na lang mga kanô dito sa mundo natin.  period.

      another day, another... peso?  i just got my check for the first half of this month.  nothing could really perk you up than getting your month's pay -- make that half of your month's pay.  though i know that compared to my friends, mine's probably just half or a third of theirs, and though i am constantly wishing that my salary is more, even just a little more, than what i am actually receiving, still i am happy.  and thankful that i am earning something i could save -- and spend a little -- no matter how small an amount it is.

      ten months after college and i am still quite mixed up.  i thought getting the job at 'the' newspaper would finally give me self-fulfillment. i guess i spoke too soon.  of course i am forever grateful that i have a job right now, considering that it is really so difficult to find one, particularly one that really suits you.  still, there are times when i can't help but wish i am with that freakin' magazine instead.

      do you think i'm too old for this crap? perhaps, no.  do i think i'm too old for this crap?  i'm afraid, yes.  but what the heck.  i really don't care.  i used to think of blogs as stupid but then i realized they could be pretty practical too.  since i am sometimes too lazy -- and more often, forgetful -- to simply pick up that pen and write, i realized i might as well have my own online journal.  so here i am.

      will be going back to work tomorrow.  *sigh.  ok, i don't want to sound like i am so full of ingratitude that i have a job.  i am actually grateful.  it's just that i do not know what to expect and i can't stand that.  working for this broadsheet has filled me with apprehension, uneasiness, uncertainty.  or so i think.  i wish could stop worrying and thinking about my job too much.  it's been in mind 24-seven, i even dream about it.  argh.

      oh well, another long lapse.  can i help it?  i am now on a two-week break from work which means my days of free, cable internet are gone.  on the other hand, i am on the second week of my two-week break which means my days of free, cable internet will be back next week.  well, maybe.  in fact, i am hesitant to go back to the newspaper-with-balanced-news-fearless-views.  so i believe it would not really bother me if the newspaper-with-balanced-news-fearless-views would not ask me to go back immediately.  i really, really, really, really want to transfer to a magazine.  so here's praying that i'd get to work for one in the very, very near future.  *sigh.

      having nothing to do at work, i took this "what kind of soul are you?" quiz.  found out that i am:  Hasn't anyone ever told you that you're artistic?  Fair enough. Perhaps they haven't. But now that you know, you must become one with your inner self.  Virtues: You look for immense creativity and individuality in people, including yourself. You're not happy with anything less than brilliant, and you focus on being expressive. You value energy, liveliness, and upbeat personalities, but you're not supportive of moodiness when you yourself can be unreliably moody. Seeking activity, you like the bustle of business but need the secluded atmosphere of a studio or private corner.  Aspirations: You feel the need to express your talents, whether it be through writing, drawing, singing, dancing, composing, performing, or photographing. While you strive to ever improve your work, you want to display it as soon as possible when your impatience kicks in. You want to be a prodigy but you might not have the means right at your fingertips. Trust me, do NOT move to New York to do it. Yeesh!  Quirks: Conformists bother you because of their lack of individuality. You're often late or unreliable. You're showy and refuse to share the spotlight. You only tell little white lies. You worm your way into the hearts of others, but be careful; some people despise the show-offs.  Factors: Surround yourself with activity and you'll always have material to work with. Involve friends and family in your projects so they don't feel like envious outsiders.  Future: Show business or not, you'll settle down happily if you're among those who appreciate your natural talents and desire to perform. Don't stay in one place too long, and don't be too hasty in defining your relationships. Who are you to judge what only time will tell?

      so my main reason for having this blog was so that i could practice, catch up on writing, right?  right.  the long lapses between my posts bother me.  really.  does that mean i'm just plain too lazy?  probably.  it's just that i often find myself at a loss of what to write.  fine.  just to justify my being remiss.

      just when i thought i'd be alone last friday night, my dad calls up to tell me that the most-wonderful-person-i have-ever-known a.k.a mikko is on his way to pick me up and from the office, we would go straight to the reunion i was babbling about previously.  and true enough, the most-wonderful-person-i have-ever-known a.k.a mikko came, rushing from a previous and very important engagement.  so sweet, isn't he?  i just love the guy.  so much.

      i have a reunion to attend tonight.  a high school reunion.  and i am not sure if i could still go since i'm still in the office, stuck, waiting for one of my editors to finish, too tired and raring to go home.  besides, i am not sure if i WOULD still go since i'd be by myself.  i don't really have a problem with going to this reunion alone, it's just that i would really love to go to it WITH 'him.'  instead of going by myself.  i was actually looking forward to this reunion because, apart from seeing my high school friends after a really long time, i thought 'he.' would be able to come with me and they'd finally get to meet the great love of mine.  unfortunately, 'he.' could not go with me since 'he.' has another more important occasion to go to.  so it'll just be me tonight.  if i am still going.

      one year ago, i endured sleepless days and nights poring over my thesis...  going through every gathered data...  trying to squeeze out of my poor and battered brain whatever information i was able to draw together from the visits we made to the dumagat settlements.  one year ago, i was more than willing to do anything just so i would complete my thesis and graduate on time.  one year ago -- though i was more than willing to do anything to complete my thesis and graduate on time -- everything seemed like an impossible feat, like a victory so sweet you could almost taste it but for some reason, no matter how hard you try, you always tend to lose it.  one year ago, it felt as if i was swimming in a pool of anxieties, fears and worries.  and though one year ago it seemed impossible, i managed to get by.  now, one year later, here i am.  still alive.  still breathing.  still coping with the stranger truths of life.  but i'd get by.  we'd all get by.  all in God's time.

      Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. . . . It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more. -- Erica Jong

      been having this very animated discussion about the war with some of my friends in college for several days now.  it is actually very interesting and amusing with how we see the war, the american government's invasion of iraq to supposedly "free" the people, and how we have differing, even warring views.  it really saddens me that one of my friends even think that UP students are close-minded and that we become anti-war because it is cool to be anti-american.  (and she is from UP, too.)  i could honestly say that my being anti-war, anti-bush administration is not attributed to my being from UP.   nor am i anti-war because i think it is cool to be anti-american.  i pity my friend for thinking that way.  where on earth did she get that?

      i can't believe i forgot to make an entry about the show the most-wonderful-person-i-have-ever-known a.k.a. my baby and i went to last march 28.  i was just so overwhelmed and happy all i could think of was thanking him for bringing me to the music museum that friday night.  so, why am i gushing?  because cynthia alexander played there.  and not to mention other good bands.  yes, cynthia "the music goddess" alexander.  she is definitely one of the real musicians we have right now.  and there are her sessionists, of course, which are equally excellent.  i can't believe i actually saw her play, up close at that.  it was a very surreal moment.  it was like being in a dream.  it was like being in a reverie.  i am absolutely positive that everyone present that night would agree.  and i was just so overcome with bliss and exhilaration, i would not want to be anywhere else that night.  my most respected artist on stage and the most-wonderful-person-i-have-ever-known a.k.a. my baby sitting there next to me, holding my hand.

      it's been a long, long time since i last wrote anything.  it's been over a year (or two?  can't remember) since the last poem, the last short story.  it's been over two weeks since i wrote the article which will never be seen on the papers.  it's been over two months since i last wrote the one and only great love of my life a letter (though i always text him and there have been messages--personal and not forwarded ones--which, according to him struck him/hit him right on the spot).  it's been over a month (nearly two, actually) since i last posted anything on my blog.  you have no idea how frustrating that is.  i know, i know.  i'm just plain lazy.  dammit.  and one of my goals is to be a writer?  i'm probably the laziest, most sluggish "writer" alive.

      soliloquy  i'm changing the name.  maybe because i got tired of "chew over this?"  and maybe because "soliloquy" has more...  mmm...  profundity.  whatever.  ...pronounced soleelokwee. (sorry, my character map doesn't include those special, special characters used in dictionaries. where do they get those anyway?)   soliloquy is the act of talking to oneself; a discourse made by one in solitude to oneself hence the name of this journal. for who else would i be talking to as i write but myself right? ok, so maybe sometimes i'm pretending that i'm talking to you. only you aren't talking back. or i am not allowing you to talk back. anyway, even if this blog would not solely be comprised of soliloquies (i'm beginning to have a strong affinity to the term), i'd still like to call it that.   maybe one of these days i'd again change the name. i don't know.   but until then...

      turning 23 a couple of days ago didn't make me feel any different.  that is until my grandmother told me when she gave me a ring with tiny diamonds for a gift, "ate, naalala ko, 23 ako nung ikasal kami ng lolo mo."  ok...  so what's that supposed to mean?!?!  and as if that hasn't crossed my mind.  and how could it not cross my mind?  almost everyone's always asking, "o kelan kasal?"  fine, maybe they're kidding, right?  but jokes are half-meant.  and besides, it's been a semi-"nagging" thought already, if i'm going to get married--if WE are going to get married. but we're still young, right?  right.  say it again:  we're still young, right?  right.  i think i may have to repeat that to myself everyday henceforth.

      last night, june 19, was surreal... but nice.  very nice.  and that's putting it mildly.  ecstatic, elated, euphoric, rapturous, thrilled, overjoyed, extremely happy.    these aren't even enough to describe how i felt after she, the music goddess approached our table last night, asked "asan na yung may birthday?" followed by "anong pangalan nimo, day?", scribbled a thing or two on my cds' inlay cards, greeted me a happy birthday while on stage and sang "comfort in your strangeness," one of my much loved songs.    yup, i'm talking of none other than the music goddess herself, cynthia alexander.  and i will be forever grateful to tito atô and, of course, to my wonderful mikko.

      much as i don't want to write anything about this girl and waste my brain cells--not to mention my time--i couldn't help it. she's too much already. getting worse by the day. er, make that by the minute.  and i  thought   i've met and seen the worst in college.  i really don't want to be bothered by her, but as the song goes, "the more you ignore me, the closer i get, you're wasting your time..."   yup, the more i try to ignore how irritating she is, the more annoying she gets.  and it's not just me, mind you.  i don't understand why and how there could be people, grown-up people, like her. i'm not exaggerating, i'm not saying that i'm satisfied with myself as an individual, i'm not saying that i do not have faults, that i'm flawless. i'm  not .  but i don't think i've ever met someone as selfish, as self-centered, as insensitive, as dense, as inconsiderate, as numb, as unfeeling, as tactless, as egocentric, as thoughtless, as thick-skinned as this girl.   and she calls herself a christian? with matching worship days, retreats, goody-goody books? what an insult.  and what infuriates me, what frustrates me more is that she could get away with it. or so it seems.  and as much as i don't want to transfer to another section and be away from my friends in the office, i couldn't wait as well. because transferring to another section would mean being away from her and that means relief and  freedom   from all the negative feelings she gives off.  i can't breathe whenever she's around.  that's how irksome she is.  somebody better teach this girl a thing or two. somebody teach her some manners. because, apparently, when it rained good manners and etiquette, she wasn't able to catch a single, miniscule, teeny, tiny drop.

      saturday night saw me and my sweetness walking, walking, walking through the old, old, old streets of intramuros, passing time while waiting for his li’l sis. the original plan for that saturday was to watch affinity at 70s with ailene, tito a. and whoever would show up. but my sweetness had to pick up his li’l sis from the duncan sheik concert that saturday night and he suggested that he would bring me to 70s first, probably he could finish the first set, then run to the aliw theater (which is near ccp) to pick up li’l sis, bring her home then rush back to anonas. because i so love my sweetness and just wanted to spend as much time with him, i suggested that instead of going straight to 70s and having him drive back and forth qc and manila, i could keep him company while waiting for li’l sis. good thing we’ve long been planning to go to roxas and intramuros so we ended up having dinner at the latter’s walls and walking, walking, walking its cobblestone-paved streets. and having an affinity for things and places old and antique, not to mention having my sweetness with me, regardless of missing affinity, it was a wonderful evening.

      i know!  i've been so engrossed with my neopets lately and so occupied with how i could have more neo-pera (as i like to call it).  ok, should i now officially declare that i am indeed regressing?  did second childhood came early for me?  i sure hope it did not.  let me just say that this is one of my "escapes."  escape?  yes, escape.  for all i (or we, whatever) know, my sanity nowadays could be attributed to my having a neopet (or two).    and that is just about one of the lousiest, most outrageous excuses i have ever given (and heard).

      i have this 3-week-old writing assignment.  done with the interview.  not quite done with the transcription.  not at all done with the story itself.  not at all.  the spirit is willing--very willing, eager, enthusiastic, disposed--but the flesh is weak, very weak.  and such a procrastinator, too.  and i hate it.  not that i cannot do anything about it.  as a matter of fact, i know i'm not helpless about it.  not at all.  just that i oftentimes find myself choosing not to do something about it.  i better snap out of this.  and it better be soon.  really soon.

(as if i could do a lot about it.  all i can do is change the colors, the fonts, add something here and there...)  semi-renovating a site could be really quite a handful.  i just wish i got to appreciate the "wonderful world of blogging" earlier, back when i was still a (clears throat) bum and had a lot of free, idle time to myself.  it was only a few months ago that realized how fun it is, really.    ok, am i starting to sound like a geek now?  uh-oh...

      twenty years ago today, a great, great man was killed.  as he was going alighting his plane at the airport, someone shot him.  you see, he had a great dream for the country and for that not-so-great people wanted him dead.  and now, twenty years later, they still don't know who ordered his assassination.  i'm beginning to believe that this great man himself plotted his death.  for everyone's spirits to be stirred.  for his great dream to see light.  i was only three then. my parents staunch supporters of this man there was no stopping them from seeing him, going to his wake, his funeral, taking me with them and leaving me in the car with my grandmother while they worm their way through the thousands who also came to see him and prove support in him.  i was only three then and knew nothing.  except that this truly great man was heartlessly killed and that everybody would do everything just so his death would be avenged.  avenged by pursuing his great dream of having a free country.  twenty years later, have we?

(as if everyday is not crazy enough.)  how crazy?  take this:  i started out on a contractual position as an editorial administrative assistant for the paper’s business section, my contract for only three months.  when contract was nearing its end, editors suggested i could re-apply, this time for editorial production assistant.  (the difference between the two:  editorial administrative attends to the editors and reporters' needs, collects and files stories from reporters (and constantly nags them those that need to be submitted), sorts press releases, coordinates with reporters and photographers for coverages, etc.  editorial production does mostly proofreading, layouting of pages, checking final drafts for errors and corrections.)  so i did.  and passed.  so after my three-month contract (i started december last year, ended mid march), company gave me a two-week break and april 1, i resumed work, this time as editorial production assistant.  (reason for two-week break:  so i would be compelled to complete another six months probationary period thus prolonging regularization.  my three months as a contractual employee will not count.)  so, when i started (again) last april, i was with the business and front page sections.  but because one EA didn't make it as a reporter, there was an excess.  and that excess turned out to be, you guessed it right, me.  but since we are a "pool" of EAs,--well, supposedly, though that is seldom seen--i got assigned to different sections.  one day i was doing business, then front page, then metro, then sports.  it was fine really, but it could be quite complicated.  it was like being scatterbrained although it wasn't really your choice to be.  and to make things more insane, i was tasked to substitute  again   for the business section's editorial administrative assistant!  for a month while she tries out for reporter! so i would go the office earlier than my usual time, do administrative work then  transfer  to the pool to do production work.  yes, it was insane.  it was like being on a pogo stick (though i've never tried one). i thought i'd never see the end of it.  and now, i'm back to doing solely production work.  and after helping out the sports EAs (one of them had to take a two-week leave due to an accident) and after also taking a two-week leave by reason of the ill-timed chicken pox affair, i am now with the opinion section.  been with them for a week.  so far, so good.  the new schedule is great, very ideal:  i go to work at 12 noon, go home at 8 and have saturdays off.  wonderful.  of course it would even be more wonderful if i could have two or three days off in a week (like the lifestyle and saturday special staff), but that would sound pretty abusive and ungrateful, right?  besides, i am thankful for this sched.  really.  feels like i could do more stuff.  and the workload is lighter.  or so i think.  here's keeping my fingers crossed for  permanence .  (unless they want me to transfer to saturday special or SIM or JI.)

      a few nights ago, i asked him if he would be doing anything on saturday, if he already has plans.  "why?"  because maybe we could talk, spend much needed time together and straighten things out between us.  and he texted back, saying he's also thinking of the same thing.  so yesterday, saturday...  went on a long drive to tagaytay.  a road trip.  it was our first time to go there by ourselves, just the two of us.  and we've been meaning to go to tagaytay, perhaps if we could already avail of our leaves from work.  perhaps one saturday, when we could have the day to ourselves.  this saturday is it.  so my one and true love picked me up, left makati ten past two, reached tagaytay ten past three.  passed by  urlLink mcdo  for some twister fries (yes, it's back!) and mcnuggets then headed to  urlLink starbucks .  yes, we drove, er, he drove, all the way to tagaytay to have our twister fries/mcnuggets/coffee fix.  :)  besides, we could use a different starbucks ambience.  picture this:  you're holding that steaming cup (or your fave frap), the cool breeze playfully tousling your hair, chunks of olive green islands scattered around a small, sleeping volcano sitting on a midnight blue lake.  starbucks tagaytay is definitely it.  that is until they come up with a starbucks boracay.  or or palawan.  or vigan.  or benguet.  then we're officially a starbucks-infested nation.  anyhow...  because it was a saturday and the city was teeming with guests, one and true love of my life suggested we look for someplace more peaceful and quiet.  where we could really talk.  because that's why we went there in the first place, right?  so we ended up at the picnic grove.  where we cleared things up. and straightened things out.  so we left tagaytay around 6:30.  reached manila around eight.  and made up for lost time.  had dinner at a veneto. talked some more.  and went home.  and we're ok now. and together again.  thank God.  a bright and sunshiny day indeed.

      it was only when he let me go did i realize how much i really, really, really,  really  love him.  it was like a slap on the face.  a big slap at that.  i thought i could live without him.  i thought i could carry on.  yes, i'd still live.  besides, i have to.  but there would be nothing anymore.  nothing but emptiness.  a void so great it would be impossible not to feel it, to ignore it.  i was so stupid and childish and insecure and demanding.  i wanted to hug him, have him in my arms, say sorry, tell him that we would work it out, it would be ok, we would be ok.  but before i knew it, he was letting me go.  and i didn't want him to let me go.    but he already did.  now what?

      funny how i've always been hooked by those quizzes.   are you fit to commit?  is he the one?  what kind of girlfriend are you?  what's your beauty aura?  what's your comfort cocktail?  which time of day are you? what's your celebrity look?  what's your pop star style? which fucked up barbie are you?  and even though i know very well that those personality, romantic tests could be the least accurate and truthful, i know that i would always be drawn to them.  i don't know.  could it have anything to do with our never-ending search for our true selves?  maybe.

       what time is it?    she’s watching the time—the hours, the minutes, the seconds—as it went agonizingly slow, as if taunting her of a hopeless and futile waiting.  she doesn’t know if he’s just forgetful or dense and insensitive or just plain stupid. she was left with the promise that he’d keep her company, at least over the phone if situations will not allow them to be physically together. and this happy thought kept her going all week. she should have known better. how could she be dreamy and positive every time he tells her something, that he’d keep his word? how could she fail to remember the times he let her down? how could she overlook the pain, the hurt, the wretchedness he had caused?  she had promised herself a lot of times already that she will never expect anything from him anymore, that she will not be gullible and trusting of him to keep promises. and he knows that, too, because no matter how heartbreaking it was for her, she had to tell him straight that she’s given up any expectations she has of him. he seems to be fond of putting everything,  anything   ahead of her anyway.   now, could you blame her, for being so insecure? for being so doubtful and unconvinced? could you blame her if, despite already having him, she still hopes for that  someone   who would be with her, who would make her feel important and indispensable, who would be consistent in his affection, who would keep promises, someone who would not always put her behind and leave her hanging. and he does not know that this has now crossed her mind. and he does not know how painful it is for her to think this way. and he does not know how miserable this makes her. and he does not know how it is to wait endlessly.   no, he does not know a thing.   how long could she still hang around for him?  how long could she hold on to promises broken and thrown away?    she doesn’t know if he’s just forgetful or dense and insensitive or just plain stupid.   or maybe his claimed feelings are just slowly fading?

      had a teeny, tiny  fight  with my sweetness.  got very upset when he didn't even text or call whether he got home safely or not.  you see, i need to know if he's able to reach his house all right and in one piece, realizing how unsafe the city is at night.  and all it would take is one  really, really, really, really   short text or one  really, really, really, really   nippy and freakin' phone call!  is that too much to ask?  is it?  so very unfortunate of him to have someone who worries over him and his safety too much, eh?   now where's that mental notebook?...

      five days into a chicken pox-ridden week.  though the itch to scratch i definitely could not overcome, still i am fighting the  strongest  urge to pop ‘em all.  my mom said i could already go back to work monday.  much to my horror (and dismay, for din’s looking forward to another week of  vacation , albeit unpaid.)  anyhow, i told her i don’t think i could  show up  at the office with marks and scars still too obvious on this now dreadful face.  the past four days (discounting sunday since it wasn't until monday morning that the chicken pox was confirmed) saw me feeding my addiction to  neopets, sleeping, eating and watching tv.  very reminiscent of my days as a bum.  *sigh*  minus the sims.  *sigh* and while i’m  relishing  my being a couch potato nowadays, must confess i’m starting to go overboard catching up on television.  have been following the first few episodes of  meteor rain .  (that’s book two of meteor garden, you freak.)  i've been meaning to watch the show anyway.  to see why and how people are so hooked.  now i know.  karma.

      i used to hate mondays.  have always regarded it as the lousiest day of the week.  though ever since we started having badminton training on monday mornings, i couldn’t help but look forward to it.  much more now that i finally have the racquet of my dreams, many thanks to the one and only love of my life.  =)  the weather’s been quite schizophrenic lately.  sunny in the mornings, a bit cloudy middle of the day then rain cascading, usually  in buckets, at night.  nothing wrong with an erratic weather.  but the thought that the creek along our street might overflow again and cause massive flooding which could even extend inside our houses -- like what happened august 2000 -- is very much unsettling.  call it paranoia, but just the same, i don’t enjoy downpours anymore in its entirety.  i used to revel in rainstorms -- the pattering of rainwater on roofs, the sudden flares of lightning, the growling of thunder.  that is, until our house got flooded knee-deep.  i have a feeling that anytime soon, my hand will sprout a racquet.

      it's 1:30 a.m. and i'm still here in the office.  you guessed it right!  working overtime for saturday's features pages.  argh.  i don't know how i got stuck with staying five, six hours beyond my time doing advance pages.  i'm starving, haven't had dinner, although i have one of our "weekly rations" courtesy of a food joint specializing in home-cooked meals.  i'm starving but i still haven't eaten it.  don't know why.  i'm right now craving for a veneto's chicken cutlet parmigiana.  or friday's mushroom, chicken and mushrooms.  or that breaded thing mikko and i ate at bubba gump last monday when we met up with his ex-officemates.  oooh, my grumbling stomach!!!  i hope our plans on saturday push through.  i'm really looking forward spending time with the rest of the brats.  we have a lot of catching up to do.  i miss our deep, intimate, not-so-deep, sometimes far out but always frenzied conversations over dinner or while simply lounging around.  i miss laughing with them until our sides hurt and we all get teary-eyed from laughing so hard.  i miss fooling around with them.  i miss them.  i want to go home.  now.  i still have to wake up early.  we have badminton tomorrow morning, er, make that later at 10.  oooh, my grumbling stomach!!!

      after, more or less, four years of constant use and abuse, our family's beloved monitor finally gave in.  it's so devastating.  really.  i was only then that i realized how much a rather big part of our lives revolve around the pc.  now we can't do anything else but sit in front of the tv.  hahaha.  and because i'm really, really, really short in funds and it is still five long days until the next payday and because i got a new discman recently (funny because it is, technically, my first ever--the other one's really mommy's, though i sort of claimed ownership of it--i could just imagine my seven-year-old kid's incredulous face when i tell him or her, "but, sweetie, mommy got her own discman at 23..."), i couldn't get a new monitor, as much as i want to.  it's so unfair, really, how other kids could, in a flash of daddy's or mommy's shining, shimmering credit card, indulge themselves in the most foolish of whims.  and then there are those kids who have to patiently and agonizingly wait for life's, errr, simplest necessities.  i know, i know, i'll shut up, i'm starting to get a bit trifling.  by the way, in case you're wondering how i was able to post an entry, i'm still in the office and a very kind soul let me use her internet account.
