      Things are a little slow at first. But, anyway: This scene involves some DJing on Hiro's part, and some pretty decent dancing on the part of the PCs. It takes place at Marcus (a CoX mage)’s birthday party. I think we have something going by tapping the whole rave culture meme. The traddies seem -very- receptive to it. I did some spellchecking and light grammatical editing here, to make it a more enjoyable read.  And yes, Pob, I fed her a line of total BS :) ---  Collecting his gear, Hiro dumps the majority of his crap back into the backpack; tucking the ream of records under his arm, and leaving the headphones hanging from his neck. He maneuvers to his feet, and sets into a stroll past Marcus and towards the sound setup; jerking a thumb over towards the turntables. "Open decks, right mano?" he asks, en route.  Millia dohs, of course, introductions would be nice. She smiles, "Tal, I'd like you to meet my friend Kasui. Kasui, this is Tal."  Marcus keeps his eyes on Kasui as both she and Kaze are pulled away. He moves his presents to the side where they are safe, then starts to wander back, while watching everyone. He grins.  Tal takes Kasui's hand and shakes it firmly Western-style before returning a bow from the waist with a sheepish grin. As he straightens he says, "It is nice to meet you Kasui."  Kaze chuckles at what Alyx says, "Fate often works in interesting ways, especially for folks of your persuasion, or so I am told."  Jess enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jess has arrived.  After putting his guitar away, Abel heads over toward the food table. He seems to be more comfortable on the edges of the gathering, but smiles pleasantly to those he passes by.  "You have no idea," Alyx assures, agreeing somewhat with Kaze. "Still, here feels more comfortable than down in the city, though I'm not entirely sure /why/ yet. Do....do you think anyone will mind if I try and mingle?" The latter query is spoken with some hesitation, a note of shyness entering her voice.  Connelly 's leaning against the wall in an out of the way portion of the 'party'....  Marcus glances over to Hiro, his grin still bright. "Sure. Decks open. You wanna set up to play after Alex gets a few songs in, that's good by me."  Jess stops at the door in and blinks a lot. She looks around and just blinks several times at the tables and the people. "I really need to read notes more often..." she glances around for Millia or Tal.  Alex stands from the Seat of Correspondence and heads around the table for the keg. "Feel free to take over," he offers to Hiro just as Taproot's, Poem starts to play.  Millia is by the food table leaning comfortably against Tal, an arm around his waist, and a soft smile on her face. Currently they are both talking to Kasui who stands in front of them.  Hiro gives Marcus a cheeky thumbs-up, hopping over the load of wiring, and wedges his records between a pair of crates on the floor. A moment is spent inspecting the decks; thumbing the auxiliary output to the speakers off (so as not to interrupt the current music), and jacks his headphones into the base of the mixer. "Thanks, man," he answers, flashing a grin in Alex's direction. "Be a few minutes, though."  Abel grabs a plate and some sandwich stuff and makes a sandwich that would make Dagwood proud, as well as chips and, seeing Connelly against the wall, goes over to talk to her. "Not a big partier either, huh?" He offers some chips and a section of the sandwich he cut in quarters.  On his way over to the keg, Alex's eyes pass over the table of pills. He then notices Jess and gives her a nod in greeting, "Hey, Jess. How are you doing?..." he says as he refills his cup.  Kaze shakes his head speaking with Alyx, "No, not at all. Just be sure to introduce yourself if they have any questions." Jess nods to Alex "Doing pretty good you?" her attention diverted for a moment now.  Kasui's handshake is, of course, very gentle to the point of being limp. The firmness of Tal's shake surprises her a bit, as evinced by the way she blinks even if in no other way as she says, "The... you are Mirriya-san's... ah... teacher?"  Alyx smiles a touch. "No problem," she murmurs softly, then adds with a crooked smile, "I feel like a child on my first day at school." Then, that said, she turns away from Kaze with a slight incline of her head, and drifts towards the music setup; towards Hiro.  Connelly looks at Abel, and shakes her head, “No...Not one for partying around mostly people I do not know....If I were to party.. I would rather have a number of friends there....if that makes sense.."  Alex pauses a moment to consider Jess' question, covering the pause with a drink of his beer. "Pretty good," he finally says in response,” Busy..."  Tal nods to Kasui and smiles, "Yes, I am, for what its worth. She is an excellent student. Picks up on things amazingly quickly. You'd think she had the benefit of a past incarnation telling her what to do." He squeezes Millia fondly. Abel nods to Connelly. "I understand completely. Chip?"  Jess nods softly "Heading over.." gestures towards the food table and Tal and Millia "Busy can be good." already walking away from Alex though to Millia's side.  One studio headphone propped against his ear -- held snug by his shoulder -- Hiro slips a record onto the left table, setting the needle down. No music emits from the speakers, but some kind of heavy, thumping beat is audible if one is in close proximity. "S'up?" he asks Alyx, head bobbing to follow the beat; his hands play across the mixer controls, adjusting sound levels to his taste. "Sorry about Daze earlier, girlie. Whatisname, Aaron, had her mondo paranoid."  Marcus seems lost in the party, watching everyone intently. He moves over toward one of the unopened crates, popping it open and sorting through the stuff. He laughs, softly, while in the box.  Connelly smirks.."I would rather not touch anything here I didn't make myself....no-telling what those are chips of....I do have to be at the hospital tomorrow for my shifts...  Millia blushes slightly at the compliment as she reaches back behind her to take both of Tal's hands in hers. She chuckles, "Don't listen to him...he really is a better teacher than what he makes himself out to be."  Mention of Aaron, draws Alex's attention to Hiro. "Aaron giving trouble?" he queries.  Abel shakes his head. "Marcus wouldn't do anything like that. He knows some of us don't do that stuff and would never force it on them unknowingly."  Alyx lets slip a chuckle as she muses to Hiro, "Burning houses and human excrement. So I remember. Do you think perhaps when all this good stuff is over, you could tell me more? I guess she was understandably...reluctant." And, randomly changing subjects without a clutch, she then wonders, "Have you ever listened to a drum machine set onto 'random'?" Connelly wells..."Unfortunately...I do not know him...in fact...I really do not know many around here yet..."  Kasui 's mouth curves at the edges in that sad phantom-like half-smile as she replies with a lavish warmth, "You seem to have a close relationship. I am sure, despite what you say, Mirriya-san, it is all true. Perhaps you even do have a past incarnation to help you through unknowing."  "Nah, but I once wired a drum machine to synch with Dave's -- that's Pobble's monkey -- circadian rhythm while he was tripping balls." Even the monkey's a drug addict. Big surprise. "Killer samples." A thumb nudges the edge of the record, skipping it forward a few beats, and Hiro slides the crossfader all the way to the other side; settling a second record onto the right deck. "You a tech-head?"  Marcus peers over at Connelly, "Those are potato chips," he says. Good hearing on that guy.. wow. "And, if you don't know people, here's your chance to get to know them. You're not gonna get to know them standing over there." He grins, making his way toward her.  Abel nods to Connelly and turns to look around the room. He points over toward Tal and Millia. "Well that's Tal. He's a Chorister like me. Millia there with him is his student. I really haven't had a chance to talk to her, but I hear she's a dancer." He then points to Jess. "Jess... Well Jess is Jess. Marcus," He points, grinning at the man as he comes over "The birthday boy, is a Cultist."  Alyx shakes her head, amused by the thought. "Far from it, in most cases. I can just about handle sending email and playing solitaire, and occasionally programming my VCR - well, when I used one, anyway," she responds with a wry smile.  Abel takes a bite of his well stacked sandwich and offers a wedge to Marcus.  "Ah-so," returns Hiro, crouching down slightly to fiddle with the connectors on the right table, straightening, and tagging a few buttons on the mixer. A finger touches down on the left record, an analog-rewind back to the beginning of the track. He twists a couple more dials, and lets his hand come to a rest on the sound board. "You dig hard trance?" he asks, tagging a button. ...and the music dies. What the hell?  Kaze wanders his way over to where Kasui Millia and Tal are talking, ever Kasui's quiet shadow, "Good evening Millia-san, it is good to see you again." he says from the edge of the conversation.  Jess stops by Millia and Tal and smiles brightly to Millia "Heyas..." looking past her at the food table. "What are the different pills?"  "Some, yes. The kind where you can immerse yourself in the pattern - sorry, the beat, and find new ones all of your own making." Alyx frowns slightly as the music dies, head cocking a touch to the side.  //.etro: Hiro rolls "arete" to staff only at diff 4.          For a total of 2 success(es).  Millia shrugs at Jess' inquiry, "Dunno, got me." Then she smiles to Kaze, making the introductions, "Tal this is Kaze, and Kaze I'd like you to meet Tal."  Connelly nods.."I have Met Millia, Tal, and Jess...I know they are really more suited to just staying off by themselves..."  Tal smiles down at Jess and shrugs noncommittally. He turns to look at Kaze who has just been introduced to him. To avoid any further culture clash he keeps his hands to himself.  Not that Tal has a choice, as Millia's holding them.  Jess looks much to curious for her own good, she reaches out and picks up one of the heart shaped pills and pops it, seems testingly before turning and leaning up against Millia. "Hi" she chirps to Kaze and Kasui  Kaze half-bows to Tal, his shoulders mostly, "Hajimemashite, and pleased to meet you." he says seemingly equally at home in both languages as he offers his own hand in a seeming attempt to put Tal at ease. "To have a student like Millia-san speaks well of her teacher."  Kasui murmurs quietly, "I am glad you caught up with me Sempai," something softly mischievous in her voice as her amber gaze is slitted within half-lidded epicanthic folds. Jess receives a bow and a warm gaze, "Hello Jessu-san. How are you doing?"  ...silence. The little death of a party. 	--and, then, the music comes back as a low, subliminal thrum: bass rattling at a level that's felt in the bones rather than heard, a low -thump thump thump- that rises up through the floor, suffuses the room, and -- as it peaks, and Hiro twists two dials simultaneously to redline -- explodes into an audible matrice of sound.  Tal bows to Kaze from the waist and then frees one hand from Millia to shake Kaze's. He speaks, "Thank..." before the explosion of sound cuts him off.  Marcus peers back at the sound as he dips down into the ICEBOX (that he forgot to put in the desc of the Stuff), pulling out a can of soda. He grins, then shouts out, "Those speakers aren't supposed to put out that much sound!" And then laughs. Shaking his head, he wanders over toward Connelly, holding out the can. "Here.. enjoy the party." He smiles.  Alyx considers the speakers, then the DJ behind them, shaking her head in more apparent amusement. "I'm going to go over to the food table," she murmurs, just loudly enough to be heard over the thumping music. "Do you want anything while I'm there?"  Connelly smiles at Marcus..."Maybe I am? This is more an opportunity to see what others are like...I really am not much of a party person...."  "Sorry," calls Hiro over the noise, flashing a grin in Marcus' direction. The sound begins to fade away from it's mind-piercing levels of it's own accord; sliding back into the realm of being comfortable party conversation material. It's likely it didn't come entirely from the speakers -- kid was showing off. "Yah, grab me some party favors," he answers, cocking his head to the side again, and administering to the second record.  Kaze's attention is also snapped in Hiro's direction as the sound explodes throughout the Chamber raising a brow slightly but seems to take it in stride turning his attention back to Tal.  Alyx nods, drifting over to aforementioned table and beginning to load up two plates, a variety of foods on each. She takes her time about it, fingers drifting over the food about an inch above touching it, as if she's selecting the 'perfect' one. Weird.  Millia winces at the blast of music, then smiles, liking the beat. She let's Tal finish what he was saying though before saying anything else.  Abel nods to Connelly and points over toward Hiro. "Hiro over there I just met today, but I like 'im. He's cool to talk too." He looks around the rest of the room, hmming to himself.  Jess looks thoughtful as the heart shaped pill doesn't bite her or taste bad and leans more against Millia as she leans down and snags a white one pulling back to pop it. She looks between Tal and the others talking.  Abel says, "I don't think I really know any of the others."  Connelly nods..."Well....point out those from the Cabal called the Invisible College? I would much prefer to avoid them..."  Kasui's body tenses a she jumps just slightly in the wake of the sudden music, but she quickly seems to decide she likes the groove herself. For all of her demure and traditional seeming ways she lets the side of her that experienced the techno-mystic Hongkong nights surface with its plethora of nightclubs and modern rhythms. No one could accuse her of being a good dancer per se, but her body's natural balance and hand-eye coordination goes a long way for making gyrating hips and a bounce to the beat seem fairly attractive. Reaching over, as she is near the food table anyway, she fills a cup with the frothy beer in the mini-keg and take s along draught.  Marcus holds out the can to her, still smiling. "Well, here's a Coke for ya, if you want it. Relax, drink up, and absorb the music." He grins. "I'm gonna get back out there and enjoy myself." He sets the can down on the top of the broken wall beside her, then nods, flowing back out to the people.  Abel points. "Hiro is the only one here." Abel waves to Marcus as he wonders into the crowd.  Alex takes another drink of his beer as he makes his way over to the food table. He fills another plastic cup with a selection of fruit and then turns to look over those that have gathered. Looking to see who has migrated where.  Connelly nods..."OK...so...everyone else here is safe...  Alyx is likewise at the table, just putting the finishing touches to the two plates of party food she's assembled. Considering, she then reaches for cups, apparently planning to add drink along with it.  Tal begins moving slightly to the groove that Hiro is playing. He gives the young man a thumbs up before returning his attention to the group he's standing with.  Alex leans back against the table, looking over to Connelly. "I suppose that depends on what you idea of 'safe' is..." he comments.  Millia laughs watching the bouncing Kasui, "You look so cute." After saying that though she begins to dance. Unlike Kasui, she has had dancing lessons, and did very well. This girl has to have been a club kid at some time as her arms glide out in front of her and up in a fluid and graceful motion, then back behind her head, as she starts to bounce to the beat.  Abel blinks. "What's up with you and the IC, if I may ask?" He also seems to feel the rhythm of the trance, but he keeps pretty controlled himself.  Serene? Well he may be most of the time, right now however Kaze seems to just let the beat take him enjoying the party and the music. He seems somewhat at home in the techno beats, perhaps he spent time in the futuristic heart of Tokyo or similar places as well as the reclusive Shrine he hails from.  At first glance, Alyx might seem unaffected by the music, though she's definitely in a good mood. A nod is offered towards Alex before she departs the table, heading back to the DJ to deliver homage in the form of food and Newcastle Brown.  Well now that Millia is dancing, Tal no longer stops himself. He moves back just a little bit to give himself room and begins to dance. He has no natural grace or lessons to guide him. Just a sense of music that seems supernatural in and of itself and the presence to carry off whatever he does in front of a group of people. Passion radiates through his movements as if the music flows through him in some visceral way so that it appears sometimes that he's telling the music what to do instead of the other way around.  Abel is standing off to the side talking to Connelly currently, bobbing a bit to the music and eating a sandwich.  Kaze grins slightly looking in Kasui's direction, but generally Millia and Tal as well, "Remember Kohai, the great sage Kung-Fu-Tzu said "The Noble Person is not a Tool." his grin is slightly devilish.  Connelly wells..."Safe..as in...not likely to insult me just because I am Irish like their leader, some guy who *CLAIMS* to be a doctor...Or who is not more drug addled than an Ecstatic."  Marcus slides over to the Council table. He peers down at the white pills, then chuckles and reaches for a couple. He meanders across to the other table, gets a cup of ale, then downs the two pills, happily, and chugs down the drink and lets himself flow into the music.  The beat slides down, returns, slides away, and bursts back into full force as Hiro slides the crossfader back and forth; behind the decks, he almost seems like a different person. Perhaps he's actually sober, for once. Thankfully, whatever harsh words Connelly has for the Invisible College, Hiro is too absorbed in his music to pay much attention. The first track glides smoothly into the second, and he unloads the leftmost record: leaning over to locate a replacement. "Thanks, chica," Hiro addresses Alyx, once he's come up with a second record; fitting it onto the table. He pats an unoccupied stretch of platform, probably indicating for her to set the chow down.  Jess leans away from Millia as she starts to dance and watches with a grin now, she watches Tal as well though before looking at Kasui comparing notes perhaps before she joins in. She waits until the music bursts back into full force and then starts to dance, it seems most reminiscent of Millia's style.. perhaps that is where she has been learning.  Alex watches Connelly for a moment after her statement, a slow nod. "I can see that you are going to get along really well here," he comments,"...Not that I, personally fit anything that you seem would consider unsafe...."  Kasui finishes off her cup of beer and shakes her shoulders as her long fount of midnight tresses splashes in a spray about her visage, amber eyes glittering as she lets a giggle of sheer abandon drift from her lips, "No way! YOU know how to move, Mirriya-san!" Kaze's words get a faint shake of the head as she shrugs and throws her arms up, moving her hands through her hair and shaking the side-tail she had bound it in out with the removal of the band that held it in place.  Rather than set the food down straight away, Alyx perches herself on that empty spot, depositing both plates on the platform beside her, along with two plastic cups of ale. "No problem, maestro."  Well if she's gonna dance to techno, Millia might as well get out some glowsticks. Yup, she very definitely a club kid as she pulls two glowsticks connected by a string from her purse lying on the floor. As the music kicks up in beat so do the lines of light that start to form on either side of her body.  Abel nods to Connelly. "They are a bit out there, but we're connected in the One and Agape says to love everyone."  Abel looks a bit abashed then. "Listen to me... it's a party and I'm talking religion and philosophy."  Kaze watches Millia, his head canted to one side with amused interest as his eyes follow the glowing lights, "You wouldn't happen to have more of those would you?" he asks just loud enough to be heard.  Alex turns his head a little, a sideway glance at Abel, from behind the shades. "Well, whatever the One and Agape says," he says looking back to Connelly,"They are on our side. Might as well, at least, be civil to them...."  Millia nods to her now open purse, that has several glowsticks attached to and not attached to strings in there.  Skipping the next record to match the first's beat, Hiro bobs his head slowly, repeatedly, and slams the crossfader with the heel of his hand; kicking into the new track. That slide he's inching up must be the tempo, because the beat -- a strangely mellow track, at first -- is slowly gaining in volition: edging up towards a hundred and fifty bpm. Headphone still braced against his shoulder, he flashes a grin in Millia's direction, indicating her with beat-bobbing index and middle fingers. "Girlie's goin' off," he comments towards Alyx, before returning to his music.  Kasui carefully flows in her gyrating swirl of liquid motion so that she has positioned herself to form a third point of a triangle with Millia and Jess. There is no doubt now that she is simply watching and moving her body in a manner reminiscent of theirs, even if with far less skill and experience in doing so. It remains, simply, that she is someone who knows her own body well , though, and as her limbs and body smoothly ripple through the waves of music that crash over ad through her, the primal feel of connectivity to the sound itself is no small thing. All throughout this her thigh-length tresses, now loose and free at their maximum length, fail and sway about her in a an almost counter-dance, like liquid midnight encircling her.  Jess blinks a little bit losing herself in the lights and coming to a dead stop as she just stares at the lights Millia is twirling. When Millia pauses Jess sucks in a deeper breath and grins. "Can I have one or two as well hon?"  Alyx smiles somewhat, nibbling on a chip thoughtfully as she watches the three dancing women, nodding a touch. "Love the glowsticks," she murmurs in response, swaying just a touch from side to side, despite practically being sat on one of the speakers.  Not to be outdone by Millia, Tal's whirling movements seem to take on a more predatory stance, as if the dance he first learned was of the street fight. His eyes begin to glow a bright blue as do his fingers where they stick out of the gloves. Now if anything he seems lost to the world around him caught up in the music and the beat as if this were some sort of secret prayer to his God.  Connelly frowns,"Well...personally...considering the fact that the limey bastard who leads this Invisible College automatically hates me because I am from Eire...well...the Leader of a Cabal speaks for the Cabal.."  Marcus starts to drift through the music, his moves slow, even through the quick beat. He flows more like water than flesh, legs, arms, and body all coordinating to carry him across and through the old Certamen circle, kicking up age-old dust under his shoes. Eyes closed, he seems to allow the music pass through him and guide him forward. Slowly, his motions begin to stretch and blur, literally, as if he were moving in slow-motion through the beat. Perhaps he really is..  A sheaf of black rectangles is unloaded from his bag -- now mostly empty -- and Hiro abandons his post behind the decks; letting the track run on. He deposits the fliers on the edge of the refreshments table, shooting a sideways glance towards Conelly and Abel. "Pobble's family got hit by the IRA," he replies, quietly, shoulders rolling silently. "And the Invisible College doesn't have a leader." With that, he heads back to his post.  Kaze reaches down drawing two pairs of two glowsticks attached by a string from her purse with a wide grin upon his face and pausing for a moment one in each hand, the others hanging down he closes his eyes to focus letting the beat of the music flow over him and then well he sets them in motion. Fast motion to, they blur and spin seeming to dance through the air leaving streaks of after-image as he whirls them not with the skills of a raver but those of an expert martial artist, it's an advanced kata that glows. Though despite all the fancy moves and keeping two separate strings going at once he doesn't hit anyone around him, a few might seem to come close but the 'weapons' seem like extensions of his being as he creates a beautiful lightshow to the beat.  Never to be outdone, Millia nods to Jess as she circles of light spin up above her then beside her moving in an ever fluid motion. Somehow this chick manages to even move around and spin in a circle while keeping the glows going, as they spin around her own graceful motions.  Jess reaches into the purse and grabs a red glowstick on a string and a blue one for her other hand, not nearly good enough for two strings yet. She starts to giggle uncontrollably now at Tal and calls over the music "Cheater" but it is entirely good natured though she seems to be having trouble to stop giggling. She starts to twirl the one on the string getting it ripping before focusing enough to cause her other hand to twirl the blue light in a pattern. This she seems to have practiced as well.  Alex glances over to Hiro when he makes his comment about Pobble and then looks back to Connelly. He gives a small shrug,"I guess that this Pobble blames anyone that is Irish for the death of his family. Hardly rational, but understandable that he would be angry and want to have something to focus his anger on..." Another shrug is followed by a long drink of his beer.  Abel blinks when he hears Hiro's comment, but the young man is gone and the music is loud and It seems Abel is sort of concentrating on other things as the power and music wash around him.  Alyx leans over to Hiro as he returns to his decks, wondering curiously. "Who is this 'Pobble' person?"  Hiro's set moves on; his vibe seemed a little harshed by the brief interaction with Conelly, but he settles back into the music after a few minutes; harshing a transition, near the beginning, with a slightly off-set beat. He corrects the mistake quickly enough, however; taking a break from the tables to palm something from his bag, and wash it down with liquid from one of the plastic cups. "He's our chemist," he replies, shoulders rolling. "You'd know'm if you saw'm. He's got this crazy blue pigtail thing goin' on."  Kasui practically skips over to the purse, a glow of intensity about her that brings a glint to her eyes of purest enjoyment. Pulling forth a pair of glow-sticks she, in a way, follows both the example of the other two girls and does something similar to Kaze as she seamlessly blends the motions of the stringed glowsticks into her simple, primal, gyrations. The air around her HUMS as she whips the sticks around wit the control of someone who has trained close-combat weapons for the better portion of their lives yet with the abandon of someone who is simply letting go in a rare and much-needed expression of something deep within. Spirals and circles wrap and overlap, and there is no use of magick to aid it. Natural hand-eye coordination and trained reflexes make it seem as though she is literally encased in an aura of glowing light from the speed with which she whips the lights about her body.  Connelly clenches and unclenches her first at Hiro's comment..like she wants to say something...but...she will not ruin Marcus' party by brining things up...she just shakes her head, and looks at Abel,"My first mentor, who meant more to me than my own mother, dies in an IRA bombing of a subway station...however..it was protestants who nearly killed my sister by burning my home down..." She just shakes her head, her voice having a tinge of sadness in it...not anger. She turns her attention to watching Kasui and Millia dancing...and sighs a little wistfully...  Well then...you cheaters...guess Millia has to bring something else out of her apparent toy box to dance with. The strings are reeled in the glowsticks are soon in her hands, a solid glow of light flowing down one arm to the other as she moves to her purse and grabs for something with a single hand. With a single pull a small baton is in her hand as a black rhythmic ribbon comes streaming out of her purse, with stars painted up and down it which glow like glowsticks. One smooth motion of her arm and the lines of stars are above her and spinning down towards her as she moves away from the table again.  Kaze's body seems to flow almost inhumanly smoothly going even beyond that which is normally associated with advanced practitioners of Do as the glowing circles of light dance around him as he directs them through the katas that would normally be done with Nunchaku or similar chain weapons. A couple jumps are added the sticks twirling beneath him while he hangs in the air for a few seconds on each one before landing easily. As if that wasn't enough though his sticks begin to glow a bright neon and their trails elongate creating some spectacular effects indeed.  "Chemist?" Alyx muses, her voice still reflecting curiosity, even through the music. "Odd. Anyhow...I don't think we ever got properly introduced, except for the other girl, Daisy, calling you names." She almost offers her hand over, intent changing as she realizes he's probably got his hands full, what with flicking switches and sliders, spinning and changing the media...all that jazz.  Tracers abound around the birthday boy's limbs, his body still shifting and moving with the beats. Marcus is still lost in the music, occupying a small space on the floor near the center of the circle. As he moves, he alternately mixes in a half-break, some pure dance, and liquid. His tracers aren't drug induced; his look more like what you would see if the motion blur caused by speed was slowed down astronomically... strange.  Tal begins to perform nigh acrobatic moves that would make an Olympic gymnast seem well, not klutzy, but outclassed by comparison. His glowing fingers and eyes whirl in the darkness as he backflips and somersaults through the air with near superhuman agility. Sometimes it almost seems as if he could fly with a bit more oomph behind it.  A thumb tags the sampler, as the obligatory weird-ass vocals kick into place: not the usual saccharin cheese, really -- but, as Strongbad pointed out, it's probably from some old sci-fi movie. He keys in a few effects on the sampler, letting the voice ('This is the place of my birth...birth...birth') echo out, slowly fading away through the course of the track, and into the following piece. He's rapidly running out of records; he probably didn't expect such a positive response. "'s Hiro," he offers, during an allowable break in his attentions; offering Alyx a hand. "DJPB." If anyone knew what the letters meant -- well. It's his private self-directed joke.  Euphoria and just a generalized feeling of happiness seem to pour out from Millia as she dances now with her rhythmic ribbon in her hand, stars flowing around, above, and to her. It seems to be flowing from her fill the room.  Alyx stakes and shakes the hand briefly, quick enough that she doesn’t impede his work. "Alyx," she replies thoughtfully. "Do you even need the rest? I was always told to do a full introduction the full time over...rank, order, all that crap."  Jess just stops and wobbles a little eyes wide as she looks from Millia and Tal and Marcus and Kasui and Kaze... mouth open a touch like she is a touch overwhelmed or perhaps a little to Euphoric now. She has this silly grin on her face though and has finally stopped giggling.  Abel watches the goings on around him but doesn't quite seem to see them... or maybe seeing more than is readily apparent.  "Bani Order of Grumpy Old Men, bani rune-hackers, initiate exemptus blah blah blah," drones Hiro, flashing his teeth at Alyx again. "Save the titles for the wrinkle-bags, I say." And this would be why his reputation in the Order is so shoddy. Back to the music.  Alyx laughs brightly at Hiro's response, shaking her head. "Perfect. Just...perfect," she replies with a chuckle, sliding from her perch down to the floor. "In any case, I have to make a move. Things to do early on."  Kasui extends her arms to her sides and lets her glow sticks wrap about her wrists as she stops moving for a moment. Heading off to one side, actually where the presents were placed as it seems a safe place, she quickly strips off her trenchcoat, wrapping what seems to be shaped like a sword beneath it and then tosses her sweater atop that. She then, letting the stringed glowsticks whirl from her hands again, dances a slowly flowing path back to Millia and Jess, falling back into rhythm with them now that she is considerably less burdened than before.  Kaze releases the glows sticks letting them fly into the air, really not distinguishable as more than balls of light now with the neon glow coming from them as they begin to dance on their own as if he was still controlling them and begins executing acrobatics to rival Tal.  Hiro flashes a peace-sign in Alyx's direction, still grinning: whatever he palmed earlier seems to have hit his bloodstream, and it shows in the music. The last record takes a twist towards the frenetic, and Hiro's cranking the tempo up to something closer to challenging levels for all these crazed martial artists; regular skips surfacing as he overlays repetitive scratching with the second deck.  Alex remains leaning against the table, picking chips from the bowl, occasionally and washing them down with his beer. His eyes move around the room. Watching both the dancers and the DJ.  Abel shakes his head to clear it a bit. "I need Air." He starts to make his way around the dancers to leave the room, his grey eyes still a bit distant looking.  Millia seeing Tal and Kaze's display of acrobatics drops her mouth a little, although this girl doesn't even miss a beat as she continues to dance. At an appropriate time in the music the stars spin away from her. Have you ever seen someone who knows Capoeira dance before? Well if you haven't, you're seeing it now. While not flying overhead, Millia's movements and acrobatics look amazing as she dances about the room.  Kasui 's near to completely bare torso glistens as flowing waves of delicately toned muscle ripple beneath the surface and make the vivid dragon tattoo that takes up most of her back see to spring to life. She spins about, her palms planting on the floor as she lets the strings wrap about her ankles, releasing them from her hands and rising into the air with her second spin to bring a spinning butterfly kick about in a breathtaking crescent at head level. As she lands she simply rolls her hips letting them sway and undulate in the vacillating release of the moment.  Jess curls a bright grin on her face, playful really and then she arches her back dropping the glowsticks to the floor with a unheard clatter. Her form collapses coalescing with a strobe-like flash into a ball of golden light. She is about the size now of a softball, warm golden and glowing as it bobs in the air there. Quite similar to the glowsticks glow but golden and a bit warmer. The ball starts to bob a little faster then twirls out moving quickly around Millia in a spiral that passes through the ribbon ethereally now and then without actually messing the other girl up.  Kaze lands in a perfect Crane Stance balanced only on the toes of one foot long after he should have landed. He holds both hands out in front of him palms up and one of the glowsticks, having finished their stringless aerial dance, falls neatly into each hand as he pauses a moment to crack his neck, "I haven’t cut loose like this in a long time." he says with a broad smile on his face, seeming to have succeeded in escaping the worries and concerns that might normally plague him, or just momentarily leaving the vaunted Akashic serenity by the wayside as the case may be.  Abel stays clear of Marcus as he heads of the room. He has a clue as to what's going on there and doesn't feel like fighting it right now.  The final track begins to slow down, then rapidly accelerates: hitting an insane tempo peak that stretches out into a self-looping repetitive jitter, exploding into a final crescendo of sound which -- if it's natural, and that's beyond unlikely -- suggests concealed, immensely powerful speakers. 	Slowly, the beat begins to wind down, and Hiro slaps a CD into the Discman, engineering a final transition into some stock high-energy Sasha to smooth out the end of his set.  Kasui lets her entire body simply fall limply to the floor, where, like a serpent, she writhes in sensuously undulatory waves until she upturns her body into a hand-stand and then bounces from hr hands onto her feet again. Spinning in a downward spiral she extends her left leg in a motion that sweeps above the floor like a propeller blade only to raise, on the ball of her foot and still spinning, to her full height where she extends that left leg above her head and holds it there by gripping her foot with one hand.  Kaze finally drops out of the Crane Stance tossing the glowsticks back near the purse from whence they came and goes in search of something to drink.  Alex’s head moves back and forth as he eyes move over the people on the make-shift dance floor, from behind the shades. His head stops moving when Jess shifts into the ball of light, perhaps watching her... it from behind his shades.  Extricating himself from behind the tables, Hiro retrieves the drink Alyx fetched for him; downing it in one long draught. He watches the dancers wordlessly for a long moment, a lingering smile -- which, by his pupils, is as chemical as it is vibe-induced -- fixed on his face. A sideways flicker of attention towards Conelly, then: his smile falters just faintly, and he edges off towards the woman. "Hey," he prompts, "..sorry about my friend, huh? He gets a little out of it, sometimes, you dig. He don' mean anything by it."  Marcus finally slows himself down (or is that, speeds himself back up?). The blurs fade, bringing him back to normal. He's sweating now, beads of it curling on his forehead and glistening on his arms. However, his eyes are still closed. He breathes slowly and carefully, then suddenly... stops. His eyes open, glazed over and unseeing, and he stares across the room, frozen in place. "Ah.. ah.. huh..." He starts to reach out toward The Chair, then begins wandering toward it. He starts to murmur something, but the music.. the music is too loud..  -- Here things get all weird and wonky. Pick up the log for that elsewhere. :)

      Pobble's head falls back until he's able to view Abel.  "Do you do?" he asks, folding his arms across his chest. His right hand fingers crawl across his left hand to the wrist and rub there, flaking off what looks to be dried blood.  "You should try. As a meeting ritual for our Cabal. Meet and greet.. I made it just for you.."  Abel shakes his head to Pob. "'Fraid not, but, like, thanks for the offer. I gave all that up when I first left 'Frisco." It doesn't look like he has fond memories of that part of his life.  This new abundance of objects appears to confuse Daisy. Surrounded in a landslide of smoking matterials, she makes feeble grabs out toward the joint. Finally, she catches hold of it, takes a single, long drag and passes it over toward Pobble.  "No shit, you're from the Bay, too?", she asks, then echoes, to Hiro, "No shit. He's from the bay, too."  Pobble takes the beast, managing to catch some falling burningness on his hand. Doesn't seem to bother him. He takes only a small draw, his eyes showing that perhaps he's already where he needs to be. Still, he makes another offer to Abel. "We left Frisco too. Brought it with tho." he scrunches up his nose again, sniffing before retracting the offer for long enough to have another small drag. "Sure?"  Hiro's eyes appear to be crossing. He stares up at the field of stars, blinking slowly, and slowly sinks backwards onto his elbows; exhaling in a long, narrow stream. "Zesty condiment, Pob my man," he congradulates the chemist, eyes rolling backwards to fix on a half-eclipsed approximation of Abel's eyes and forehead. "From the bay," he declares, extending a fist towards Abel; presumably to be thumped. "My -man-."  Abel nods to Pob and grins. "I'm sure." He thumps Hiro's proffered fist.  Very well. The blue meanie heads on back to Hiro.  Hiro's hand twists away, accepts the indigo zeppelin with an overdramatic flourish. "Muchos grassyass," he thanks Pobble, or -- perhaps -- merely states: the local choice of seating will result in a great deal of grassy asses. Another murderous drag, albeit slightly more casual, and he passes it off to Daisy again. "Whatchoo on, anyway?" he asks the punk girl, smoke curling out around the words.  "Blue. Thing," Daisy says. Obviously, she's on some kind of coherent speech inhibitors.  Pobble grins up at the sky. "Toldyaso." he says. Something seems to occur to him at that moment and he rolls over onto his belly to stare at Abel. "Where the hell did this Realm come from by the way?"  "S'huge," Daisy comments. "Hope the Nodes aren't here in Toronto."   Abel shrugs and talks with Pob, though he seems just a bit confused and amused by Hiro and Daisy. "Don't know. I think maybe one of the nodes are in Toronto, though."  Hiro's eyes roll about in their sockets of their own volition. He waves a hand meaninglessly. "Been thinking," he comments - uh oh; here it comes. His finger points, apparently to his surprise, at Abel. "You know anything about gnosticism, m'man?" Lovely. Completely lovely.  Pobble sighs semi-inaudiably and relaxes back onto his back. His eyes close and he zones out, concentrating only on the voices of those around him so that they are all that's real.  "Fuckin' Gnosticism," Daisy agrees, bobbing her head in time with Hiro's inquiry.  Abel shrugs a little to Hiro. "A little. Learning with the Chorus you pick up a bit on things like that." He grins. "What's the question?"  Hiro snaps his fingers in Daisy's direction, a nonverbal indication of her bogarting the furry blue wyrm. "Ah, yeah," he continues, gaze rotating to fix on Abel again. "So, the gnostic premise, right, is that the god that lords over us here, he's this like blind idiot type, right, like Cthulhu-style blind idiot god. Right. So. I was readin' the bible, 'cuz I blew the transformer outside our hotel and I was up, so - yeah. Dig: Genesis, right. All this shit about the earth and beasts'n, hell, Man takes a day just to cook up on his lonesome, for our great biochemist in the sky. But, like, no attention to the heavens. Totally glossed over. Firmament and all dat nonsense, you dig, but no mention of other worlds, other stars, et cetera et cetera." He's obviously rambling; it'll be a bit before he gets to his point.  The furry blue thing is rapidly shrinking throughout Hiro's speech, as though she's resolved not to exhale until he's finished talking. Lungs hardened to bricks of ash and scar by chainsmoking, she's able to take in a surprising amount of smoke before exhaling.  Abel is sitting with the Invisible College. "Well it's something like that," he answers Hiro.  Rhiamon wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Rhiamon has arrived.  Millia walks from the forest, carefully picking her way though it as she heads into the fields. She must be in a good mood as seh is humming softly to herself as she strolls along/  Rhiamon returns to the grasslands, and strolls along the established path, idling picking a stalk of grass, and swishing it through the night air.  Siomen steps out of the ruins with Geero in hand, he glances around slowly  "So: islike," Hiro is sprawled out on the grass, snapping frantically at Daisy for the relinquishment of his furry blue joint. Pobble is kicked back somewhere near his feet, eyes closed and zoning out. He's speaking to Abel; struggling to convey some complex concept. "Now, yeah, dig, I'm not an atheist or nothin', def. not gnostic, kinda a-gnostic, agnostic, you dig." A-gnostic. Counter to thought. What an amusing slip. "But, rez, maybe th' reason that gets glossed over in the bible is 'cuz this demiurge, this sub-god, the bloke who like mindlessly, needlessly tortures us, he only has dominion over the Earth. Right? You diggin' this? He glosses over the heavens, there's that whole lack o' data in the bible, 'cuz he doesn't recognize them. Because his vision is, wotsit, occluded. Pretty much every astronaut who's left Earth's talked 'bout this feeling'f immense peace, calm, they come back talking all this 'one world, one people' stuff, dig. Maybe they get in contact with the real deal up there, the over-god."  Rhiamon waves her grass stalk to Millia and Siomen, never forgetting Geero, as they come into her field of vision.  Abel considers Hiro for a moment. "Well, as a Monist, I believe in only One God... Men and women wrote the bible. And just because something may be missing from it doesn't mean it was never written or never there. There are gnostic books and all sorts of religious works out there that never made it into the bible. The Chorus looks at Gilgamesh as one of theirs and he deffinitely traveled to other worlds."  Millia seeing Abel and Rhiamon smiles and waves to them both. She stops just behind Abel listening in on the current topic of conversation.  Siomen nods to Rhiamon and smiles, he glances to the others and tilts his head, only catching part of the conversation at hand, sounds interesting.  Abel reaches a hand over his shoulder for Millia to take and smiles at her. "Hey Millia, The One's peace be with you." He nods to Siomen. "Hey Siomen, Geero, long time no see."  Hiro mulls this over wordlessly, eyes returning to the starry void overhead.   "Stephenson -- Neal Stephenson, you dig. He cloaked the entire concept in science fiction, but he believed that the old testament was guarded religiously, so to speak, kinda like, keepin' backups. Maintaining clean data. They tried't again at the end'f the bible, unnerstand: the whole 'pox upon thee' spiel to dis-dis-uh-courage, discourage people from altering the data. You think the information quarantine, the whole upkeep of the torah and the old testament broke down? That it's 'dirty' now, rez -- infected with opposing memes?"  Kid's totally out of it. It's doubtful he's noticed the new arrivals.  "On account of they're outside the range of the Sphere of the Archons. Dig: they call them the Lords of the Air. Satan. One of his titles is: 'Lord of the Upper Air'. Maybe it's vacuum," Daisy speculates. She's really reaching here; she waves the joint in the air, as though clearer thoughts could be summoned up from its vapour.   After a contemplative moment, she continues: "You plot all this shit out in gematria -- I don't do gematria, mostly, my man Hiro here does gematria -- and you come up with this: YHVH is balanced. In Y-H-V-H, Yod has a value of ten billion: the apotheotic ten. 10^10. Look that up on the charts, and you find it's a multiple of the firmament; the air itself. Hod has a value of the apotheotic eight. That's the same value as Earth. Which is why Y and H are together. Y-H. Heaven and Earth. V-H are his lesser domains: the fire and the waters, one of which he created the djinn out of, and the latter of which he moved upon. God moved upon the waters. No power over the waters, dig? On account of that he had to get them out of his way. Which is why when you're in a bathtub full of ice water or in space, the Archons can't see you."  Daisy is speaking at the same time as Hiro. It's difficult to pick out either's words.  "But all those are false elements. Which is why 'Elohim' -- six letters -- is the true name of God. Yod-heh-vau-heh is a decoy for idiots."  Siomen continues to listen to the conversation and frowns as he tries to puzzle out what the guy is going on about, he nods to Abel "it has been awhile"  Geero is totally fixated on the stalk and attempts to swat at it like a kitten.   Rhiamon grins, and weaves a figure of eight with the grass round Geero's paws, watching him swat at it. "Siomen ? I think his reflexes are improving.."  Siomen smiles "you've noticed, i have been trying to improve his gear systems little by little, but he is actully doing half the improving himself, like a child learning and tracking familiar patterns"  Millia takes Abel's hand smiling using it as a balance as she sits down with the group, "May the One's peace be with you as well. Interesting topic of discussion today."  Pobble looks pretty comatose.  Out of it for sure. Sleeping. A big throaty snore bursts from his lips and wakes him with a start. He sits up straight, having the grace to look embarrassed. He whistles to himself, very very quietly and shuffles back in the little group to make room for any potential sitting newcommers. "I agree wholeheartedly." he comments. A nod. A cigarette. Bosh.  Abel continues to consider Hiro and Daisy, and looking like he's enjoying the amount of thought going into the discussion. "Like, I'm afraid I don't know Gematria but I know some people who do in kind of an off hand way. And I've never read this stephenson guy. I don't know if the Bible and Torah were quarentined like you say, but if they were suposed to be, then with Translation, yeah it's been 'dirtied.' Part of the reason the translation to the vulgate from latin was because the information might be changed... not because, like, it was putting the info away from the priests and clergy to the masses.  Rhiamon beams at Geero, and rubs his head affectionately, adding absently, "And it wasn't written in Latin to start with. That was a couple of translations down the line..."  Abel shakes his head. "I don't think that was the main reason, Siomen. Orthodoxy is tricky stuff. Maybe some thought that way, though."  Hiro's head twists, his eyes roll, and this all comes to a head in some kind of half-assed focusing upon Siomen. "Nrrrgh," he ammends eloquently, undergoing a convolution of limbs to carpe malus: seizing Pobble's cigarette from between his fingers, and taking a prolonged, soddening drag before carelessly handing it back. "You should dig on Gematria, Abel-man," he recommends. "Shit. Fuckin' -- shit, yeah, and Stephenson. Memes-as-demons, man. Crazy." And he collapses back into the grass.  "Its all like that movie." Pob interjects. "With the guy who sees the bleeding woman in mehico.. an the bloody woman on the bed, and in the tube train." He nods, making perfect sense to himself. A big drag on that cigarette. The short sleep seems to have regressed his consciousness stakes just a little bit.  Rhiamon looks at Pobble, "Stigmata ?"  A big drag on nothing, since Hiro steals the cigarette just as he goes to smoke. Pobble doesn't notice. He looks to Rhiamon, "Where? Oh. Right. Yeah. Maybe."  Siomen looks at Abel "well think about it, most religions were not even born until Christianity was converted to English, mostly because the common man had never the choice to follow anything else. When Christianity was Latin, the common man listened to this priest and went, ok, i don't understand what he is saying, what he must be saying is right since God is who he follows. They followed because they believed what they were listening too was the correct path, Even if to them it was gibberish. When they actully converted it to English or Latin became a more common language to the populace, religions were born because people finally had a choice.. no i don't want to follow christianity because now i understand that i don't agree with the views"  "Look, it's easy to prove," Daisy says to Abel, as though explaining simple math to a child. The joint wobbles between her fingers and nearly falls into the pile of cigarettes at her feet. She's nodding as though she agrees. After a moment, she begins in on the explanation:  "The nature of matter is reproduction and degeneration. The, uh, heresiarch" -- she seems uncertain about the pronunciation of that word "-- the heresiarch Valentinius wrote 'Mirrors and fatherhood are deplorable, on account of they unnecessarily reproduce the material world'. He meant that the reproduction of material things degrades its essence. So if the essence of the Bible is reproduced into many forms, its essence becomes degraded, even if the words don't change. Which is why, uh, mass production is, uh, destroying nature; the Platonic essence, the ur-object, is being, uh, spread into these /objects/, man, and --"  She stops.  "-- shit. Where was I?"  Rhiamon rolls her eyes slightly, "Christianity isn't exactly an old religion.."  "You were giving me that joint," prompts Hiro, having totally lost the thread of conversation.  Pobble takes the cigarette back from Hiro and promptly drops it with a coughing fit. He looks at Siomen. "Say what? Most religeons were not pre-english Christianity?" he sounds incredulous, and cockney. Similar to how street vendors in london sound when they ask you who else would have such incredible deals.  Siomen glances at Pobble "I took christianity as an example you can place the same ideals on other religions too, and expecually look at the ones where it is not known to general populations, like witchdoctors in tribes, the whole tribe follows what a witch doctor perscribes because they have no clue how he is getting his information and so assumes it the right path because they do not understand it"  Rhiamon looks at the people sprawled on the grass. "I take it you're Invisible College members..?" she enquires.  Pobble nods vigourously, streching his legs back out as he sucks the last of the cigarette. Reaching up at this opposite angle, he plucks the last of the blue meanie from Daisy's fingers and hands it off to the pawing Hiro. "Indeed we are." His smile widens, "How on earth did you guess?" it continues to widen, until threatening to split his face before realizing its overstepped its bounds and relaxing.  "Of course, this isn't all of us."  Hiro had given up on the endeavor; slumping back down into the grass. It's very likely that his eyes are, in fact, literally wobbling -- a kind of lazy decaying orbit wobble -- in their sockets; scrutinizing the joint suddenly delivered into his hands. Why didn't he just snatch it up himself? "Much obligated," he mutters at Pobble. Obliged? Settling into place, he begins the decimation of the beast.  Rhiamon says "Well, there's two new cabals in town, 's far as I can tell. One Eastern, one not. You don't look eastern to me..". She turns back in time to twith the stalk from Geero's hand, and grins as he beeps indignantly at her.  "Sorry matey, but I notice we're being rude. Didjoo want any of the blueness?" he makes a vague gesture to the side, the wrong side. Correcting himself he motions to the large blue beast that Hiro has in his possession.  Rhiamon shakes her head, "No thanks. I work in language. Don't like it smothered..  Pobble wrinkles his nose at that.  Pobble says something in a language you don't understand.   "Neurolinguistic," it's amazing Hiro gets that word off, "programming?" The question has a hopeful slant to it; he probably wants someone to rant at about 'deep structures'. Daisy thought those were subterranean houses. The blue meanie is nearly decimated, now, anyway; he passes it off to Pobble.  Rhiamon raises an eyebrow. "I noticed a deterioration in your pronunciation a while back."  Pobble it seems just wanted to show off his cognitive abilities. He looks pretty wasted, but then you saw him earlier. He seems both more and less wired now. He sucks on the corpse of the joint in silence.  Rhiamon raises an eyebrow. She says something in a language you don't understand.   "That was choice of essence. I should reiterate. Language is hardly smothered by the intake of *all* foreign essence. Look at musical genius and Shakespeare's psychoactive habit,”  sayeth Pobble.  Hiro looks between the two, entirely flabbergasted, and shrugs wordlessly. He collapses back into the grass, eyes rolling back in his head.  Rhiamon shrugs. "I'm not used to taking foreign substances. Well..except for mead."  Pobble says, "There's a lot to be said for it. A whole kaboodle. Its effects on the thought structures have a great impact on reality potential." A phone starts ringing from within one of Dr Steve's pockets. He reaches in and extracts it, the ring tone has a techno vibe to it and is sampled. One of those overly fancy and expensive phones. "Hallo?" he says into the device. "Oi oi monks." Nodding follows, with some muttering, and Pobble stands up. "Shit."  Pobble brushes himself down and tosses the last of the blue meanie to Hiro. "Pigboy, I need to go and pick up my Monkey. He's double parked in the box and has spotted encroaching police personages.

      Thursday Feb 6th. Hooray.   Pobble picks up his cellular phone and begins to dial.   The phone is picked up at the far end. Keene says "Hotline."   (Directed into the phone) Pobble says "Wotcha cock mate?"   Keene says "Ehh. Not a lot. Just tooling around, taking in the sights."   (Directed into the phone) Pobble says "Where you at mucker?"   Keene says "I'm at this tropical conservatory. The one in the note I left. It's a nice enough place, if you don't mind the humidity."   (Directed into the phone) Pobble says "I just rolled in to be honest guv, and I'm facking lost as all shit. Its like a bloody maze around here."   Keene says "OK. I'll see if I can't talk you over to here. What are you by now?" From afar, Jet would be happy to help you out icly   (Directed into the phone) Pobble pauses. Looking around maybe. "Jarvis.. and College?"   Keene says "You're pretty close by. Let me see if I can't find you outside."   Keene steps out of Allan Park.   Keene has arrived.   (Directed into the phone) Pobble says "Gotcha mate."   Pobble clicks his cellular to disconnect the call and hangs up.   Keene walks out of Allan Gardens, phone to his ear. He looks around intently, trying to find his lost comrade as he takes his phone from his ear and puts it back in his pocket in a smooth movement.   Keene clicks his cellular to disconnect the call and hangs up.   There is a click as the phone at the far end is hung up.   Keene is looking at you.   "Evening, Pob," says Keene. "Lucky that you happened to be in the neighborhood. I haven't gone too far from here in the past day or two. There's really quite a lot to see." He starts walking back towards Allan Gardens. "How was your trip?"    Pobble snuffles quite considerably as he comes to stand next to you, wiping away a telltale dusting and dribbling from his left nostril. Most attractive. Those pupils are dilated good, perhaps the result of a new batch. He talks quickly, and his head is in constant motion, looking about, desparately trying to take in all the surroundings.    "Fucked mate, really really fucked. Don't ask. Last time I buy a fucking Lexus. Peice of shit. Expensive peice of shit."   Millia steps out of Allan Park. Millia has arrived. Millia wanders out of the gardens, heading past you all quietly. Millia walks west along College to Church. Millia has left.   Keene, unlike Pobble's amphetamine augmentations, has a nice mixed booze and Valium flow to him; which is to say he /seems/ normal unless you start dealing with reflexes. Of course, he's so accustomed to operating like this that he hardly seems impaired. He walks nice and slow back towards the gardens, even as Millia zips right by him, to be sure that Pobble doesn't get out of arm's reach.   "What happened to it? Did it break down somewhere, get stolen, what?"   Millia arrives from the west. Millia has arrived. Millia walks under the archway and enter the gardens. Millia has left.   Pobble has a phone in his hand, and he seems to notice this and licks the back of it in a straight, quick line before depositing it in his labcoat. He takes a deep breath, then sniffs. Deep breath. Calm.. Well, Calmer. "So this is it eh?" he says absently, to himself mostly. "What mate?" Confusion. A moment passes, and he stops moving towards the building. "Oh. Right. Broke down. Kaput.. I gave them shit, told them I'd sue etcetteraa etcetteraaaa." He heads onwards, starting to come down from the brief coke fix. "I'm thinking a Hummer to be honest as the next gig. Get everything in then eh."   "Hell to park the thing," comments Keene, as he heads inside.   Keene walks under the archway and enter the gardens.   Keene has left.    You walk under the archway and enter the gardens.    Pobble nods. "Yeah. Fuckin right." Yes, he does seem to swear a lot. Maybe its just the drugs talking, I hear they can do that nowadays. Talk that is.   A set of double doors made of ornate metal and glass.    Keene walks along at a leisurely pace, moving in the general direction of the conservatory. "Too bad about the Lexus, all the same. Next time we'll have to get an Etherboy to look at your ride to be sure everything works for a few years." He fishes his flask out of one of the pockets of his jacket, offering it to Pobble. "You want a drink, man? You seem tense."   Pobble stops dead again, staring at the flask. Only a second passes before he catches himself, and he nods - smiling his appreciation. A big fat swig, while he fishes about in a pocket for something. He comes back with a tiny sky blue pill, rolling it between his fingers before dropping it with the second swig. "That should be better.." Screws the top back on, hands it over. "Can I interest you in anything Guv?    Keene allows for Pobble's usual appetite for liquor, smiling very faintly while Pobble equalizes himself with a few bolts of smooth Canadian whiskey. Keene sinks his money into two things: his suits and his liquor. He only drinks top shelf. It's no wonder that he doesn't have much else to his name. Still, it's not like he can't get anything he wants with a moderate application of his natural talents.   "I'm good for right now," he says, accepting the flask back graciously and returning it to the inside of his jacket, continuing the trip towards the conservatory. "I'm just starting to really feel the numbness spread. But thank you, as always."    Pobble grins wide, showing off those British teeth. They're not all that bad, slightly crooked but shiny white. Better than many specimens from across the sea. "Anytime." Now he's in the swing of things. Middle ground, a nice haze that'll last. The thing with Dr Steve is that he'll get slightly high just thinking about taking drugs. Once they're down the hatch, he'll start to think he's comming up within a minute or so.    The game face appears, same one as used when dealing with murderous drug dealers and crack whores. He's entering the Zone, trying not to embarrass you too much maybe. Trying to improve your sparkly image.     Keene appreciates Pobble's occasional attempts to not horrifically screw things up for Keene's image management plans. Were it only Pobble and Hiro, Keene would have a fairly easy time keeping them in line, but the more volitile members of the cabal require almost two Keenes to keep remotely civil.   All the same, Keene doesn't seem too concerned about anything at the moment. He gradually makes his way across a bridge and into the tropical conservatory, humming to himself tunelessly as he walks.    Keene enters the conservatory Keene has left.    The scents in the room bring on another sniffling fit as the pollen and cocaine mix in unpleasant ways within Pobble's nostrils. "Facking stinks in 'ere donnit?" he says, rather delightfully. A big ubersniff is followed by a hacked up wad being spat onto a nearby treetrunk. Looking around he recomposes himself, "Where to now?"    Keene cruises along at a leisurely speed, not watching Pobble as much now. The calming influence of whiskey helps Keene out of tough spots a lot more than reasoned arguments or applications of Ars Mentis. He moves along through the gardens, following a careful path that he memorized the first time he came to the realm.   "Alright," he says, "just follow behind me, and I think we'll be let in. We have to pass by some landmarks in a particular order, though I don't know which ones are important."    Pobble nods silently, falling into step right behind you in a slightly annoying way. Not purposefully annoying, just coinkydink. "Lead on Peachy."    The drugs numb the rage. Keene, instead of muttering, merely chuckles: he proceeds to follow the exact path he took with Hiro earlier to get into the realm, down to every last pause or hiccup in pace. Ultimately, he passes through the two columns that are actually germane to the lock sequence, reaches the back door, and opens it up -- crossing over into another dimension.    Keene slips between two colums in the Conservatory. A small door behind the pillars swings closed just thereafter.   Keene has left.    You slip between two columns and through the Gate. A Dark Cave    Now that was a bit on the weird side. Doctor Steve looks suitably disorientated as he spins about in the cave, slightly stupid looking grin crawling its way onto his lips. "Groovy.." he murmers..    It almost seems he'll leave it at that, but he can't seem to resist a loud 'Wooop', just to hear the echoes.     Keene steps into the cave with a squish, steadying himself on the wall as he emerges from the swirling blackness. He waits patiently for Pobble to follow, letting him orient himself and indulging his woop before starting onward again. As one would expect, he complains about `nature'.   "They really need to put a sump pump in here or something," he says, beginning the slow process of moving along the edge of the stream into the main part of the realm. "A sump pump, a boardwalk, maybe some torches ... I mean, how much could it cost to make some philgosten-powered torches? We're members of the Hermetic Order, for Christ's sake, can't we pop for some lights?"    You say, "I hear ya." He follows behind you, as carefully as one can be while mildly wasted.    "You know.. It occurs to me that maybe we could just put one of those things in here, all lit up like."   He stops for a second, clicking his fingers in an attempt to clarify his thinking. "One of those things like they have in Florida. Scooty scooty with the big fan?""   "A hovercraft, Pobble," says Keene, moving forward towards the opening of the cave. "Me, I think a boardwalk with a golf cart would be just as well. I think they like the peace and quiet."   He continues along, gradually getting back out into the open air. "Wait until you see this," he says.    Keene heads upstream, vanishing into the darkness beyond. Keene has left.   You travel along the streambed, against the current. Slowly, you ascend the slopes and crags of the cave, until eventually a pillar of light lances through the darkness. Cavern Entrance   Faint Light dips in through the massive opening at the rough, craggy end of the cave, casting a quiet bluish glow to everything within the cave entrance. The breeze which was only hinted at deeper within the cave can be heard whistling at this hole. The stream continues up and out of the cave, disappearing off into the rolling fields before you.    You walk out of the cave, your eyes adjusting to the bright sunlight. Entering the grasses of the field, you walk for a ways, until you have reached the highest peak. Rolling Fields    "Now that took forever." says a somewhat pissed off looking Pobble. The fields and hills and views don't seem to impress him all that much. A bus stop or indeed a newfangled style hovercraft probably would more so. He takes a deep breath, causing him to sniff and wipe at his nose.   "Remind me to bring the Box next time so I don't have to go back so quickly."    Connelly looks at the person talking,"What? Who would *WANT* to leave here?"   Abel wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Abel has arrived.    Keene leads Pobble out of the cave, looking a bit winded himself. When he and his companion get to the top of the hill, he stops, putting his hands on top of his thighs. Yeah, it's break time for the suit. Hermetics don't walk through musty old caves if they don't have to. He's definitely going to consider putting together an `improvements' fund so that the trek can be made a bit less strenuous. For the benefit of others, of course.   "Yeah, sorry about that," Keene says. "These guys build big. I mean, look at all this," as he gestures with his right hand. "There's got to be a frigging ton of Nodes under this group's control to maintain all this. I bet Tass comes out when they sneeze."   Keene's attention then moves to Connelly, blinking once. He must not have noticed him initially.    Abel walks out of the hole in the hill not too long after the others, carrying a lit candle to light his way.   Pobble snickers, taking something from his pocket and slipping it into his mouth. He chews for a few moments in silence, the look on his face illustrating that whatever it was, wasn't that plesant.   "I can only imagine.." he says, scanning the horizons. The response to his complaints draws his attention finally, as if he'd forgotten about it. He goes to say something, then stops. Then goes to speak again, and stops. Shaking his head, he gives up on the whole 'trying to speak' malarky.   Connelly sighs..."This is one of the most beautiful places around...reminds me a little bit of the land around the Ruins of Tara..."    Keene gets his wind back, straightening back up and smoothing his suit carefully after a moment or two. "I'm not too familiar with those," he says, "but you're right, this is a very pretty Realm. I'm just not accustomed to having access to a Realm quite this large, you see. The largest one I'd ever been in before this one was the size of a small, very cramped house."   He smiles graciously, moving over down the hill a little bit to greet Connelly. "I'm Steven Keene; that's my associate, Dr. Alder. We're part of the Invisible College." He puts out his hand to shake with a practiced cheerful expression. "And to whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with this evening?"    Abel sees a group congregating ahead and makes his way toward them. "The One's peace be with you," he calls, announcing his presence with word as well as the light of the candle.   Connelly nods,"Dr. Jane Connelly, ER Trauma specialist, and Verbena.   Abel is looking at you.   Connelly doesn't offer her hand, as she is sitting in the grass...and that would require her to stand up...considering she looks like she just woke up...    Pobble waggles his thin fingers, not seeming to be the hand shaking type. He moves to stand near Keene.    He has the audacity to sniff at Connelly. Really sniff, as if smelling something pungent. "I say. Would you happen to be Irish?" he asks, with just a hint of obnoxiousness. The call of the One's peace draws his gaze away and a wan smile is offered to the approaching kid.     Keene gets a feeling of imminent doom. Such a feeling is common whenever Pobble starts talking about what Keene has broadly categorized as `British Isles issues' in his presence. This is, unfortunately, one of the areas where his immense powers of persuasion simply find no purchase. Not that he hasn't *tried*...   Fortunately, Abel comes along, and provides a wonderful distraction. Casually retracting his hand for the moment, he orients himself towards the younger man with a congenial expression.   "Good evening!" he says. "And may the One's peace find its way to you as well. Steve Keene, Invisible College." He puts out his other hand to shake. Why? Because that's just what he does in social situations.    Jess wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Jess has arrived.   Dr Pob wrinkles his nose, slight distaste showing briefly. It doesn't last however, being replaced with a wry smirk as he twils about, labcoat and blue 'pigtails' flying out with the movement. There's a muttering with the motion, and those with acute hearing may catch what could be the word 'Fuckers'. Maybe not tho eh?   He flashes a more charming smile to the Abel fellow. "Awright mate." he says jovially enough. Any traces of the previous moment's incident have vanished. This incident vanishing has been accompanied by a further dilation of the pupils. Abel makes hs way to the trio and smiles as he looks at the unfamiliar faces. He accepts Steve's hand though. "Abel Elison, Beacon in the Ark Cabal and Singer of the Chorus."    Jess looks around curious and heads over towards Abel now   Connelly looks, and sees Jess coming.....and waves! She looks to Abel,"Well...as I said....Jane Conelly, Verbena, currently no Cabal, as I have not yet been officially recognized by the Circle....er...sorry...Chantry Head    "Ah, Mr. Elison, a pleasure to meet you," says Keene, who seems to be as happy as anything shaking hands with anybody who comes by while tossing his name and the name of his cabal out there. Indeed, Keene is in the process of shaking Abel's hand firmly, disengaging it just before the procedure becomes tiresome.   His attention then moves from Abel, to Pobble, and then towards another new face: Jess. "Good evening," he directs to her.    Jess smiles brightly to Keene "Hi." she replies as she steps a bit closer to Abel.   Abel nods politely to Connelly. "Ms. Connelly."He then turns to see who Keene is talking to and Grins when he sees Jess. "Hey Jess. Like, What's up?"    Noticing that his compadre is getting into the Social Swing, Pobble goes as far as to offer his hand to Abel for shaking. He's smiling a big fat happy smile. "Awright." he reiterates, hand stuck out there for shaking. The other hand makes a wave for Jess as he glances briefly over in her direction. "Oi oi." he adds.   Abel sees Pobble's extended hand and shakes it as well with a smile.   Jess slinks an arm around Abel for a hug before letting go with a smile to Pobble   Pobble beams at the hand shaking, hastily moving over to put his hand in the shaking queue for the newest arrival - Jess. His free hand slips into a pocket, comming back with a crumpled cigarette which he slips behind his ear, held in place by the material of the bandana. This handshaking isn't so bad. He seems quite keene on pressing the flesh with Jess and Abel.   Jess is looking at you.   Jess blinks and looks at Abel "Who is this?"   "Hi," says Keene to Jess just after she asks Abel for information, allowing Pobble to act as hand-shake proxy. "I'm Steve Keene, and this," indicating Pobble, "is Dr. Alder. We're with the Invisible College. It's nice to meet you, miss ...?"   Abel lets Keene introduce himself and his compatriot.   Jess hooks a thumb to herself and Abel "We are the Beacon in the Dark... my name is Jess." Pobble nods his assent. "You can also call me Pob. Or Dr Steve." He nods again before flashing another smile. The actions seem to happen in order, as if he currently can't do them simultaneously.    Keene smooths his tie against a small breeze. "Hello, Jess. It's very nice to meet you and your cabal." He looks to Pobble. "We're off to sight-see a bit. It was very nice to meet all of you."    Pobble looks to Keene, confusion forming films over his eyes. "You're leaving me for these people you hardly know? That's not a terribly nice way to welcome me to town mate, issit?" Abel nods. "Alright Pob." He turns to Keene. "Would you like someone to show you around the realm?"    "I was hoping you'd come with me," Keene says, with the patience of a parent with a dull-witted child. His attention returns to Abel. "Oh, I've been given the tour -- I'm just going to give Pob here the benefit of my experience."   Jess nods "Well good luck.. dont let the animals btie:   Abel grins. "Oh. Alright then. Well peace go with you, then, and Providence guide your steps."    Understanding dawns on Dr Steve's features and he nods, relaxing to a point close to comatose and moving over to Keene, ready to head onwards. "I need to pick Dave up too. I left him in the box." Another smile to all but Connelly. "Nice ta meetcha folks."    "Yes, very nice to meet you all. We'll be careful." With that, Keene begins the careful, deliberate process of leading Pobble along, heading towards the ruins. "Mind your step, Pob..."   Pobble beams once more, heading off into the melting fields with his guide.   Keene has left.

      It was Pobble that convinced Daisy to write her resume in 16-point Bookman Gothic, but it was Daisy who turned off the spell checker, 'on account of it don't work right'. She's carrying a sheaf of half-crumpled resumes under her arm. The first entry reads '2006-2007 Superviser: McDonalds.'  The weather is awful. Hiro is miserable.  The weather is fine. Hiro is whining.  "It smells like someone shit on the sidewalk,"  Hiro complains, pausing in mid-step to examine the sole of his sneaker - pockmarked with fossilized gum, but otherwise unmarred by inter-city fecal matter. "And this motherfucking fog." The complaints do not cease. "It's Thursday night. What the fuck are we doing here, again?"  Daisy's fine. Daisy's peachy. Daisy took two tabs, both blue, out of Hiro's dresser this morning. Daisy doesn't know they were Aleve.  She's not trudging. She's almost skipping, though not quite; she's got to keep some measure of punk dignity. "Fucking fog," she either agrees or echoes. "Like, I've gotta get another part-time job 'cause there's this sweet system on sale down at Best Buy. I'm thinkin' Zumiez wants me. Either that or, like, booth dancing."  Hiro knew they were Aleve. Hiro couldn't find his fucking Aleve this morning.  Last night, he was speaking to God. This morning, the walls were bleeding.  "We have a m'fockin system. Hand-tooled and digitally mastered. Synchronized with the music of the spheres. We can produce a bassline that sounds like Jupiter, and you want a sony motherfucking boombox."  Hiro scuffs at the sidewalk with the toe of his sneaker, frowning into the glare of neon and halogen. He's come to a dead stop in the middle of the sidewalk, squinting up at some seedy dive's stand. "Why don't you just get a job as a waitress or somethin'?"  Not that one. Daisy counts out a dozen steps, stops, and turns left. Through the fog, she's a black outline floating in orange neon. Strips of duct tape at the backs of her knees glint silver.  "You think you can convince J.T. to spin some fucking Ramones every once in a while?", she asks, rubbing at her nose. "You got your system all tied up with techno bullshit, and all I want is to hear my man Dee Dee every once in a while."  Hiro's pace picks up by half a click, closing the gap induced by his lagging behind. He nearly collides with a prostitute; scowling in her direction as he falls back into step beside Daisy. "You got any idea what a pain in the asscrack it is to match the fucking ramones up to another track? You can't mix the Ramones, Daisy. I mean, it's all four-four, right, but it doesn't soun' right." Hands get wedged, straight-armed, into the side pockets of his labcoat. "The fuck we goin'?"  Paksenarrion gives the pair a curious glance as she passes thru, continuing westward. Her long strides carry her past at which point she offers a polite 'Evening..' as she passes.  Music talk makes Daisy flatline. Her forehead wrinkles into nested chevrons; she folds her arms underneath her breasts, taps her foot, waits for Hiro to catch up.  "The fuck do you care?", Daisy asks, pawing through the central pocket of her hoodie. No smokes. No pills. Not even the Valium she kiped from Keene. Then, suddenly wheedling: "Yo, Hiro. You got a smoke?"  Incongruous -- or, perhaps, entirely congruent: Hiro flashes a smile, and a casual 'V' of index and middle fingers, in the direction of the woman hailing them. If kid's on a mood swing, the thing has a diesel engine. Hands unfold from his pockets; he comes to a dead stop again, offering a crumpled packet of Marlboros up to Daisy. "You got my lighter?" he asks, patting himself down.  Yes, Daisy has Hiro's lighter. No, he lent it to her. No, she hasn't pawned it yet. No, really. Zinc-plated Zippo. No decorations. Wordlessly, she holds it up, flicks it against her thigh, and makes fire, turning a patch of fog bright orange.  Hiro gives Paksenarrion a flat, blank look, attention swinging back to Daisy. "Fuck was that?" he asks her, as if she'd know. "Quebequoithehell?" He slots two marlboros between his lips; leans forward to flare both to life, and plucks one free to offer to the younger girl. "I thought Toronto was supposed to be the friendly city."  Daisy half-shrugs; a roll of her shoulders that conveys that she doesn't care enough not to care. She puffs on the Marlboro, complains about the mythical fiberglass in their filters, complains about it being Thursday and her being Monday, complains about Keene stacking the deck so he always winds up as the Sabbath, and exhales. By the time she finishes her protracted rant -- during which you're not allowed a word in edgewise -- she's mostly finished with her cigarette.  Hiro is used to this. He nods helpfully -- or, perhaps, helplessly -- at appropriate intervals, finishing his cigarette somewhere between complaints regarding 'Monday' and '...grilled cheese sandwiches'. Hiro hates grilled cheese: he comments on this as an afterthought: "Butter shouldn't be brown." He discards his butt in the gutter, showing an environmentally conscious soul.  Daisy flicks the cherry of her cigarette with the tip of her fingernail until it finally gutters out and pockets the butt. "Fuckin' butter," she acknowledges, turning to face the door next to her.  Orange neon announces that this fine establishment is RUMP SHAKERS and that it has been OPEN SINCE 1983. It is a NIGHTCLUB.  "Maybe I should get a webcam," she muses, staring at RUMP SHAKERS neon symbol: what appears to be a crude Algonquin pictograph of a stripper.  Who is Hiro to crush the hopes and dreams of an aspiring star?  His smile is something one receives in the laundry room at the state pen.  "I told you, Daze, there's money to be made on the internet." He made a point of plucking his zippo from between Daisy's fingers while she took her cigarette: no telling when, otherwise, he'll get it back. The lighter gets dropped into a hip pocket of his cargo pants. "I've already registered junkho.org." He pronounces it 'junkoh-dawt-oarg', so as to obfuscate the spelling.”  Daisy's eyes narrow to small and suspicious slits. She stares at you dubiously, face utterly flatline.   "Or maybe I'll just take s'more quarters out of the till," she says uncertainly. It can't be that she's figured out your con. "I've got to start that shit over, though, on account of I nearly got arrested on account of some of the states the quarters are from don't even exist. The fuck is 'Mu'?"  "'sa city in Kentucky," Hiro fires back automatically. Like he'd know anything about Mu -- that's Jesse's territory. Doc Eon and the Voltraz on the Sunken Continent! Doc Eon volume five, issue 63, part 4. The pig-boy stops dead in his tracks, blinks repeatedly. "I'm out of tune," he says, blandly. He checks his watch -- "What day am I, anyway?"  "Malkhut."  Daisy's Hebrew accent is worse by far than the Mockney bullshit she affects when she's either high or thinks she's high. Sure, she can manage the hard, gutteral 'kh'; what's amazing is that she can hold it for nearly a full second.   And never mind that Malkhut isn't a day anyway.  "'least you're not Monday. You'd be stuck doin' shit for the Sabbath's dumb ass all day. And when the Sabbath is Keene, you know how bad that gits?"  "Yeah -- that's what's wrong. Let's find a place with a bathroom." Nearing the corner, Hiro looks up; nudges Daisy in the ribs. He inclines his head towards a pair of black doors crowned by a neon blue microphone. "Drop off an application. I gotta tune in wit' saturn. Maybe they'll give you a job. Nuh - holdin' the microphone, dig."  "No shit. Saturn's my favorite planet. I get to go in the K-hole," Daisy says. Kether-Hole. The Dissasociative Hole of the Supernal Crown. The sheaf of applications get folded and jammed sideways into her pocket, and she ghosts through the fog, on toward Whiskey Saigon.  Hands wedged firmly in the bottoms of his pockets, Hiro ghosts through the door Daisy-first: scanning the establishment over her shoulder. Bathrooms, bathrooms -- yeah. There. "I'll be right back, he comments, extracting a digit to thump the girl in the shoulder, and immediately abandoning her. He's making a beeline for the men's.  The blacklight highlights in her hair, not quite washed out after the last of Kid Sinister's parties, glitter green-gold. The orange and violet and shock-blue buttons on her backpack shine like spotlights. The horn-rims of her glasses glitter with spatters of day-glo orange. Even the spent glowstick dangling from her bag sputters back to life, shining green.  Cutting through the crowd, shoulders skipping off the early-evening dancers, it's obvious that she's heading for -- yeah. There. Got it. The bathrooms, right behind Hiro, whistling as though she's actually being nonchalant.  She disappears into the men's room just after he does.  A short time passes: low voices arguing, someone colliding with a stall door, and then - then, suspicious silence. A handful of minutes passes, the possibility of a bathroom quickie steadily diminishing. The door's propped open with a white sneaker, and someone -- Hiro, as he emerges -- says: "Yeah. I'll get you somethin'. Hurry up." He's replaced his spectacles with a pair of mirrored lenses nearly matching their predecessors, regarding the club with slow, wordless langour. His emergence comes in relative slow motion; nonetheless, a straight line for an out of the way booth, painfully conscious of near-collision with other patrons.  Black, of course, reflects no colour, not even ultraviolet; not even blacklight. Daisy's hoodie has been worn to asphalt grey, but it shouldn't be reflecting any light. The quarter glows green. Her name, picked out in white, glows pale violet. Those, of course, should be glowing.  But what are those tiny violet motes, scattered like flour across the front of her hoodie, falling to the ground as she walks -- conspicuously straight-shouldered-and-even -- behind Hiro?

      Daisy and Hiro make trouble.  Keene, once again, is left in the unenviable position of trying to deal with the fallout.   Major Cast: Keene, Daisy, Pobble, Connelly, Hiro, Chase Supporting Cast: Various passerby  *** *** ***  Rolling Fields  Contents: Standingwater Alyx Connelly Obvious exits: Ruins    The Living Forest    Clear Lake    Hole in the Hill    High-Tech Workshop      Alyx shakes her head, beginning to struggle to her feet. "I need to sleep," she sighs softly, the euphoric part of her drunkeness apparently over, giving way to a tired resentment of having ever gotten drunk in the first place. She sure metabolises quickly. "I'll be.....somewhere."  Connelly looks at Alyx,"OK...just...don't leave the Realm, though....  Standingwater just shrugs and minds his own business. What's he gonna do? No house here, nope.  Alyx twitches, visibly startled at something behind her. She drops to a crouch, looking wary, albeit still with a glaze to her eyes. Then she seems to shrug it off, wavering as she straightens again, beginning to wobble her way towards the ruined keep. "T- thanks, Janey, Jamaia."  Connelly looks at Alyx, and.....moves to go with her....keeping near her, like ready to help her up if she falls or something,"No problem, Alyx...I always help friends..."  Standingwater toys with his eagle feather. "Sure. Make me out to be the bad guy. Gotcha."  Connelly laughs.."No, Standingwater....you aren't a bad guy...just a grouchy guy..."  Standingwater sighs and slumps a little. "I wasn't always," he grumbles to himself.  "Remember, Jamaia. No camping on ants' nests," Alyx replies, in a startling display of clear speach. She gently shrugs Connelly away, insisting, "I'm fine."  Connelly smiles,"Maybe...but....I have seen people say they were fine after they broke their neck, then turned their heads and collapse dead pretty much instantly.....so...pardon me if I choose to stick with you till you get to where you are going, OK, hon?"  Standingwater remains seated there on the ground, grumbling quietly to himself. Cranky. Cranky cranky. Maybe he isn't getting the right pills.  Alyx turns. Or rather, her head does. "What are you on about? My neck isn't broken, and my head isn't falling off," the Euthanatos grumbles, Jane's explanation making little sense to her fuddled brain. "I swear I'm fine. I just...want to sleep. I'll be in the meditation room if I'm needed."  Connelly smiles,"OK...And..I said I will go with you until you get there...and I meant it."  Standingwater looks back at the cave. "Dammit. I left my pack in the Jeep."  Alyx exhales softly, sitting down rather abruptly. "Here is fine," she decides, closing her eyes, though remaining sat upright. Anyone with a hint of life or mind active can probably tell her hangover has begun early.  Connelly nods...and sits down as Alyx does, and frowns....."Want me to try and do something to help you, hon?"  Standingwater peers moodily off toward the cave. Probably debating whether he should go back for his pack or not.  Alyx shakes her head. "No....no I think...sleep and company on it's own is fine," she sighs, keeling over onto her side and curling up snug.  Connelly nods, and watches Alyx for a moment, then reaches a hand up to lightly brush through her hair,"And..that is why I never drink until I get drunk...  "Jamaia....come and help me talk some sense into this girl..." Alyx requests, frowning a touch. "Janey, did you have /any/ idea what was going on at the rooftop, earlier?"  Connelly ums..."Not really...I thought someone had taken you out for a drink, and....you were just tired...Though...the bugs all around that one table did seem a little odd...."  Standingwater drags himself to his feet and wanders over. "Sense? You want me to talk sense into her? Can't be done. Nobody wants to have sense talked into them. That's why I'm so unpopular."  Alyx smiles faintly. "It was more than just bugs, Jane....if you'd drunk the drink you were offered, it could easily have been everything David denied. And more. The only reason I met up with him was to confirm my suspicions....and much as we Chakravanti like to pretend we have no fear, his ilk do inspire a dread in me."  Connelly frowns.."Ok..what was going on up there, then?"  Standingwater draws a stone knife from his boot and busily cleans under his fingernails.  Alyx shakes her head slightly. "I cannot tell you all of it, my friend," she murmurs regretfully. "All I can say is this; they fear not garlic nor holy symbols."  Connelly frowns a little, curiously,"Um....OK...." She sounds really confused.......  Standingwater certainly looks clueless. But at least he's happy doing his personal hygine thing.  Alyx smiles weakly. "Trust me, Janey. Any more, and you're learning too much. Just....stay away from David, and the others he was with? Please?"  Connelly nods..."OK...if you advise it...I will...I trust you..."  Standingwater gives his knife a toss and slips it back into his boot. "I'm curious now, of course. But then I don't know the guy."  Daisy wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Daisy has arrived.  PROPERTY OF HOLLIDAY INN, the television says. RETURN IF FOUND.  The television is in Daisy's arms, the VCR is on top of it, and God knows where she's going to find an electrical outlet. She's also knee deep in the stream, wading out of the cave and into the Realm proper, and cursing out the 'fucking goddamn savages' for not building a walkway in the 'only fucking entrance'.  Alyx grins wanly to Standingwater. "If it helps clarify anything, I don't think your war arrow would do any good."  Standingwater removes one of those arrows from his quiver. "Sadly, they're not much good against anything these days. Modern medicine, as soulless as it is, is too fast and effective."  Connelly turns and looks at Standingwater and scowls a little at him,"Sorry about that....though...you know if you hit the right places, there is not much any doctor can do...  Alyx snortgiggles, a remnant of her former inebriety surfacing at some comment. "Medicine won't help these....they use magic all their own to fix their ills."  Keene has been in the general vicnity for some time. He just happens to be good at not drawing attention to himself. In fact, he seems about ready to leave; coming out from the ruins to follow the well-trod path to the exit, he is only stopped in his quest to escape unnoticed by Daisy. On hearing her `melodious' voice, and noticing the stolen goods, he pauses. By now, he's learned not to ask. Instead, he reaches into his coat, produces his flask, and downs a bolt of whiskey before capping off the flask and moving to investigate.  Standingwater gives the arrow a twirl and slips it back into the quiver. "Ah. Medicine has to work fast these days, what with the new and interesting ways people are finding to kill themselves."  "What?", Daisy asks, sloshing toward the entrance to the ruins. "What, it's better to die with supernatural than to take some fucking penicillin?"  Thump. Crash. Daisy sets the TV down, she sets the VCR on top of it, and straightens the cords out behind it. For a moment, she just stares at it proudly, thin lips quirked into a grin.  Keene makes his way to the landing point of the (more than likely stolen) TV, standing next to it. He looks over the television set and the VCR with a cool, insurance-appraiser's gaze, making American to Canada dollar conversions in his mind. He's probably trying to figure out if he could argue this down to petty theft in a court of law.  He puts his flask back into his jacket, producing a cigarette from his breast pocket. Keene lights up with a cheap plastic lighter he bought at Cracker Barrel, taking a few puffs on the coffin nail, while considering this new wrinkle in the situation.  Alyx rumples her hair up and curls up properly in the grass. "It's better to die, period. These guys don't."  Standingwater grumbles quietly to himself and takes a seat on the ground once more.  To that, Daisy can only half-shrug. One defers to the Euthanatos when talking about death. In the meantime, she unshoulders her backpack, pulls out a willow stick the length of her forearm, and begins to scrape a circle in the grass.  It's less than an inch wide, and has an odd, three-pronged symbol in the middle, rather like an electrical outlet.  Connelly blinks at Daisy,"What are you about to do?"  "That answers my question," says Keene, figuring out quickly what Daisy is doing. "We're supposed to be attached to the Forces realm, after all, so there should be enough oomph for that."  He looks at the VCR. "Did you get a movie, or will we be watching snow?"  Standingwater glances briefly at the electrical gear. "I'm wondering how she got through the conservatory without attracting attention." Alyx seems to have almost entirely dozed off in the grass, her pair of dice still clutched against her chest.  "Don't s'spect as how the reception's very good here," the young punk comments off-handedly. Then, briefly, she looks up, expression quickly sinking. "Dolley. Tarp. They're back in the cave, on account of I couldn't move them through the fucking water, which itself is on account of no one wants to take the time to magick up a sidewalk."  She rolls her shoulders in an easy shrug as she reaches to stab the plug into the dirt.  "No one asks questions if it looks like you're moving something official. Dunno. Someone might've seen me, but it ain't like we haven't tipped off the gardeners, coming an' going at all hours. Oh. By the way: hey, Keene."  //.etro: Daisy rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 0 success(es).  Connelly looks at Daisy."You know..here is a question...do *YOU* know how to make a side-walk in here? Without getting the realm angry at you?  Standingwater begins talking to himself in one of the many languages he has at his command. The grass before him changes from short field grass to... well... short river cane. Grinning, he tosses the cane at Alyx. One at a time. Someone's bored.  Connelly blinks at Standingwater,"How did you do that?"  Alyx nnnghs? groggily as things are thrown at her. "He-....oi-....hey!" she complains, lifting her hands to shield herself rather patheticly.  Connelly ums.."Let me rephrase that...was that direct manipulation of the realm....or just use of Life?"  Standingwater blinks at Connelly, "I told the grass what I wanted. Sure it would have been easier to gather some twigs to toss, but that wold have taken time."          Keene turns his head to seemingly look at something else away from Daisy and Connelly -- rolling his eyes at Connelly's comments. It's not hard to imagine why: the standpoint of most Hermetics is that nature, like anything else, is to be smacked into submission rather than coexisted with. He /does/ manage to keep the most direct way of saying this to himself for the sake of propriety. For a few seconds.         He looks back at Daisy, keeping his expression neutral. "Perhaps the Realm needs to be informed who controls it," he says, idly. "Unless, for some reason, it is capable of keeping Quintessence funneled to it by itself."  Standingwater shrugs, "Use of Life. You've seen the grove, right? That's my contribution. I figured someone around here could use it. It isn't my style, though. I just make use of the garden."  Connelly nods.."Yes..I sort of like the grove...feels like...home..."  Standingwater flicks another reed at Alyx. "The realm is perfectly capable of taking care of itself. One of our Cultists learned that the hard way lately. I'd love to know how she got that spider in here, though."  Alyx grunts at the next reed, the woman exhaling and apparently too worn-out to do much more.  "Seems pretty fuckin' amenable to the giant airship over there," Daisy comments sourly, gesturing toward Team Ether's research station in the far distance. "If it's sentient, and I ain't talking about Tweedledum and Tweedledee the guardian spirits, then I can't imagine it would mind us not getting our feet wet. And if it does, then fuck it, 'cause these boots cost me sixty whole bucks and I'll be damned if I'm buying new ones just to traipse around in Fairyland."  As though to make her point, Daisy stabs the plug at the dirt a second time. This only provokes a shower of sparks punctuated by short bolts of violet electricity. She swears incoherently at the ground, kicking at the smouldering bits of grass and leaf kicked up by the discharge.  "Motherfucking shit eating god damn ...", she begins, then breaks off. "... oi, Keene. Is the Frozen North run on 110 or 220 volts?"  "110," says Keene. "220 is Europe. You can tell because they have funny-looking plugs."  Standingwater mumbles something about needing a blowgun and waves a hand dismissivly. The reeds revert back to grass. "Things are slowing down. Maybe someone should go sit in the chair."  "If it'll afford me some kind of /rest/, then fuck yeah," Alyx mumbles, in response to Standingwater's comment.  Connelly laughs,"I don't think anyone is *THAT* bored, Standingwater..."  //.etro: Daisy rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 3 success(es).  Standingwater unlings the bow from his back and stretches out on the ground. "Well, I'm not doing it again. It sucked last time."  Alyx nnghs. "Anyone got paper 'n a pen?" she inquires, sitting up groggily. "Something I need t'do before I collapse. I'll forget otherwise."  Connelly ums..."I don't, sorry....  Above the outlet, in block script, Daisy writes: 1 1 0. The sympathetic magick appears to actually work this time: when she plugs in the television, it springs to vibrant Technicolor life, painting the faces of the onlookers pale grey.  "Fuckin' A," she says proudly, hitting the 'play' button on the VCR. "It works."  The screen goes blue.  Standingwater rests the bow across his chest. "Can't help you. I left my pack in the Jeep. Too busy herding you safely here to remember to pick it up."  Kasui exits from the forest, wandering up the hill and joining you in the fields. Kasui has arrived.  Connelly looks up and waves to Kasui!  "Hurray," monotones Keene, moving over to sit down on the cold, grass-covered Earth to watch whatever tape Daisy has decided to play.  As Kasui crests the hill, Daisy, Keene, Connelly, Standingwater, and Alyx are gathered around a television plugged into the grass. The television is turned on.   You're fairly sure there was no outlet there last time you checked.  In any case, a faint, blurry image springs up seconds after she turns it on. Toronto natives will recognize it as the downtown financial center. Hiro and Daisy -- or, rather, Hiro and Daisy shaped blurs -- are gathered around a junction box next to a traffic light. They appear to be mumbling to each other, but the microphone only picks up static and distant honking.  Standingwater grumbles about the damned machines destroying the art of storytelling. Yeesh. Lighten up.  Like a memory set adrift like bit of wood upon a stream, memories of a time long ago yet seemingly just beyond reach, Kasui flows into view clad like somone straight from the Meiji. Her voluminous oceanic blue hakama sway like waves about her legs as her zori-sandaled feet barely make a whisper upon the grass. The long topknot of a samurai flows down her back in an almost noble fasion as those midnight tresses ripple like liquid midnight. Left hand resting lightly upon th epommel of her clansword she pauses at the sight ahead of her and tilts he rhead to the side in abject curiosity...  Alyx flops down against the grass once more. Pen and paper be damned, she's sleeping now that Jamaia has quit throwing things at her.  Connelly blinks at Kasui, and smiles......  Keene rather blandly watches TV. Very slightly, as the minutes pass, his expression moves from neutral to a sense of impending doom.  Time passes. After a bit, Daisy hits fast-forward.  Daisy-in-the-video smokes one cigarette, and then another, and then another. She sits down on her toolbox, then she stands up. She throws something in the garbage. She spraypaints something on the ground, then disappears with Hiro -- who has completed whatever electronic work he was doing inside the junction box -- out of the frame.  The camera turns off.  Apparently several minutes later, Daisy reappears, half out of frame, eating a McDonalds cheeseburger in the back of a moving van. The camera is focused out the window. Time passes. All hell breaks loose.  There's cheering from inside the van -- Daisy screaming an incoherent and staticky 'fuck yeah!', Hiro giving a peace sign to the camera -- and at first it's not obvious what's happened. Then the camera focuses: two Cadilacs have T-boned in the middle of the intersection. Other cars are desperately trying to get around them. Most end up on the sidewalk. In the distance, outside the car, tinny techno music plays.  The music is playing in time with the blinking of the streetlights, which have altogether abandoned their appointed function and now simply provide a light show.  Keene stares in numb horror at the screen as Hiro and Daisy bring about several traffic accidents and general carnage. He knows enough about their modus operandi to know what they did, and how. He groans, putting his head in his hands, yet continues to smoke. He does this a lot.  Standingwater pulls the flute out of his hat band and plays along as best he can with the music on the tape. Not a bad effort.  Daisy-in-the-Realm and Daisy-in-the-video simultaneously proclaim, "That shit was rad," but Daisy-in-the-Realm adds, "for being totally wasted out of my mind. Shit. Just wanted to see what I did this morning."  She tilts her head, looks sidelong at Keene, and rubs at the stubble underneath her bob. She lets out a short burst of nervous laughter.  "Lookit that," she says to Standingwater, stabbing the tip of her wand in his direction. "Lookit that. Fuckin' technology in action, man. Try to get two moose to crash into each other at thirty miles per hour using less than ten dollars in equipment. Impossible, that's what it is."  Connelly laughs,"Daisy...Jamaia gould probably do that with less amount of equipment....  Standingwater sets down his flute and cranes his head back so he can look at Daisy, "Actually, I can do it without equipment. Just crank up their hormones to mating season levels."  Sandled feet whisper about the edges of the gathering as Kasui unobtrusively takes a few fluid paces forwards. Pausing again, she focuses upon the screen for a few moments and shakes her head noncommittaly.  Connelly smirks,"Now..please explain something to me Daisy....what purpose does that serve other than injuring sleepers, the very people we are trying to protect? How does that turn back the technocracy, bring wonder back to just one or two more people?"  Standingwater sets down his flute and cranes his head back so he can look at Daisy, "Actually, I can do it without equipment. Just crank up their hormones to mating season levels."  Alyx sleeps. Ever-so quietly....she dosen't snore, fidget, twitch or talk. Sleeping like a baby.  Keene smokes, head in his hands. It takes him a while to reconstruct his thought patterns to address this new self-inflicted disaster. He lifts his head, ashing his cigarette, and looks at Daisy flatly. "So," he says. "Why?"  Daisy fixes Connelly in an are-you-a-fucking-idiot stare. The corners of her mouth twitch with irritation. A lesser version of the same glare is reserved for Keene.  "I'm sorry. I guess you didn't get the part where we ruined a shitload of mass-produced cars, exposed a bunch of idiot suits to some badass beats and general wonder, disrupted the financial heart of Canada for, hell, I dunno, four hours, and generally made it harder for people to go about their jobs making the world more boring?" She grins. On the sharp features of her face, it only makes her look like a rat. "Do you want me to rewind to that part?"  All Keene wanted was a rationale. He is remarkably permissive of this kind of behavior just so long as some sort of justification is given for it. Wonton, rampant destruction for its own sake is intolerable; wonton, rampant destruction for some Fight Club-style end is slightly more acceptable.  "Yeah, run it back," the suited Hermetic says. "Hopefully Chase comes by; I think this is up his alley."  Connelly sighs,"No, Daisy Incrutable, I do not think you understand..." She looks straight at the woman,"Yes..you ruined a bunch of cars...and did allt hat stuff....but...by doing so, you *HARMED* sleepers. I did not say make the world more interesting..I mean..have you ever looked into a child's eyes as he or she watched a street magician? Before you awoke, did you ever see something that made you feel a sort of sense of awe at the vastness of things?"  Kasui's sad eyes settle for a moment on Daisy, a strange intensity within her gaze, before she simply shakes her head again and wanders onwards. She does not speak her opinion on the matter, she does not speak at all. She, simly, gives Connelly a brief nod and walks away thoughtfully. Kasui begins down the hill and toward the Ruins. Kasui has left.  Standingwater pinches the bridge of his sizable nose. "No point in preaching at her, Jane. She's the type to do it again just to spite you. And though I don't approve of the method, I do applaude the fact that she got out and actually did something. Unlike most of the worthless sacks of shit around here who are too busy fucking or whining to be bothered with accomplishing something."  Pobble has connected.  "Unless you got some kind of magic wand that shoots rainbows and fairytales, I figure this is the best way to deal with them," Daisy comments, scratching behind her ear. Just in case, she taps the rewind button with the point of her toe. The crash runs by again in slow motion. "This affects everyone. This makes it just a little bit harder to do the dirty work of fucking over everything that matters. This ain't 'a child's eyes'. These are cold, stupid old men with hearts made of ashes and dust. They're the same cold, stupid old men that run the Hermetic Order --"  She turns her gaze toward Keene, shooting him a poisonous gaze. Shut up, it says. Don't argue with me.  "-- and they're the same cold, stupid old men that run the Chorus. And they're the same cold, stupid old men that run the Union and keep anyone, everyone, from getting getting that connection. Well, fuck children. /Fuck/ children, you stupid mick bitch. They're getting stomped out faster in every generation, and the fucking old men will win no matter how hard you try, because they're smarter than any of us -- smarter than anyone who still cares."  Connelly frowns,"Terrorism doesn't work...."  Somewhere on the plain, a box was left. The box was cold, silent and still. Now it rumbles, and.. well, it seems to belch. There's scrabbling against the inside of the top and then it pops open, spewing out the suited monkey and dress wearing doctor. From the looks of him, he doesn't look like its been an uncomfortable few hours in the box. He looks well rested, with a crusty coating of blood over his features. Reaching back into the box he pulls a cigarette from within, and looks across the grass for anyone nearby.  "Got you sheepfuckers a country, now din't it," Daisy snaps at Connelly. Connelly points to Pobble,"Heck...ask him how much terrorism made him sympathize with the cause of an Ireland free from british rule."  Connelly shakes her head,"Yes, it got us a country..but it did not get us a nation...we are still fragmented, and...we are still at each others throats because of the terrorism used to force the brits to yield even a slight bit back to the people who should have always had it.  Pointed at already. Typical. He looks to the source of the accent being levelled at him, and heads across after leaning down to light the monkey's fresh cigar.  "I don't give a flying fuck about British Rule to be honest.." Pobble looks a little confused, "Don't really mind terrorism either, as long as its directed the right way. ie. Away from me." He stops again, lighting his own cigarette. "I just find Irish people abrasive. Scrounging bastards." He pauses, adding "Bless their hearts." as if this makes it all okay.  Keene and some other people are around a stolen Holiday Inn TV with a VCR on top of it. Keene is sitting in front of it, smoking a cigarette, while Daisy confronts Connelly in no uncertain terms verbally. Keene himself has his usual neutral demeanor, a practiced, even calm that only the best pharmacuticals can give you. However, as Pobble approaches and starts talking smack along with Daisy, the suited man thinks it wise to get to his feet; not to confront anyone, or to get in the way of any of his comrades, but probably so he can quickly get out of the way if things escalate.  "Bless their hearts," Daisy agrees.  Dave the Monkey says, "I'm Irish, you prick.". He throws a monkey fist at Pobble's leg as he says this. The Doctor stops and looks down at the monkey.  "No you ain't you twat." is the reply, and the blue haired, dress wearing, bloody faced tranny flicks ash at the suited cigar smoking monkey.  Keene glances across Pobble's features once he gets to his feet, noticing the blood. In an easy movement, he offers him three Wet Naps he snagged from some restaraunt from a back pocket. He says nothing, thinking now would be a good time not to draw too much attention to himself.  Pobble flashes a big fat grin at Keene and accepts the offering, "Cheers mucka." He hands one off to Dave who looks at it, and then throws it over his shoulder. "Wotcha?" he asks, presumably to Keene.  Connelly sighs, and stands up,"Well....I see you are young, still motivated by anger rather understanding...Tell, Miss Incrutable, do you have any family you care about? For your sake, I hope the answer is no...because...I have seen first hand what it is like to lose and almost lose someone you care about to terrorism.....  "Same old story," says Keene to Pobble in reply. He's just going to stay out of the crossfire between Connelly and Daisy. "Daisy and Hiro caused several car accidents today. They have it on tape." He gestures at the TV. "It's caused something of a stir. It's not nearly so bad as that /one/ time." What that may be remains a mystery.  A dark look begins to gather on Pobble's features. The blue haired freakish boy's sunny demeanor slowly sinking into darker looks.  "Yeah, I saw. They taped it from the Hummer." he murmers at Keene, still staring at Connelly.  "The thing you forget, is that you're talking about religeon. Poxy religeon and occupation. That's nothing.. it means nothing. We're talking about war on a greater metaphysical scale. Ascension isn't a dream, it's a fucking struggle that many people seem to have forgotten."  Dave the Monkey nods solemnly, then takes a big toke on the cigar. "Oi, Pobs you freak. Take this a mo." Dr Steve takes the cigar, and the monkey runs back to the cardboard box, diving inside and rumaging.  "Actually, I don't fuckin' know who I lost or for what reason," Daisy says offhandedly, jamming her hands into the central pocket of her hoodie. Her poisonous glare turns back to Connelly. "You lost someone you care about. I'm sheddin' a single tear for you right now, honey. We all lose people."  Her sneer has turned into something virtually feral, and her hands ball into tight fists inside her jacket.  "It don't turn all of us into cowards."  Connelly shakes her head,"It is a struggle for the hearts and minds of the Sleepers, though...the way you two are fighting the war...we might as well just kill all sleepers....Try something different...try working with sleepers instead of doing things to harm them..it may not be completed in our life time...but...neither did the Technocracy's getting the strangle hold it has....  Connelly sighs.."In fact, The technocracy started by working the same way, I do believe..."  "And now we ain't living in hovels, slaving away for the Church and the State, now are we?", Daisy snaps.  From within the box, just a little way away there is a snorting sound. A long drawn out snorting. Then another. And a third.  This is followed by some sniffling, and Dave Monkey jumps back out of the box, running merrily back to the gathering, where he leaps to grab the cigar and hops down in front of the telly.  Pobble quirks a brow at Connelly. "Joe Public don't want us to work with them, they want to sit back watch cable, read their email and veg out with techno-easy living.." Pobble falls backwards, as if he's just fainted. He lands on the ground, flat on his back with a slight 'Ow'.  Keene finishes off his cigarette as Pobble talks. He doesn't so much as flinch as Pobble falls down; this is pretty normal by Keene's standards. The suited man does, however, walk over and offer his hand to Pobble to help the dress-wearing gentleman back to his feet. "I kind of like indoor plumbing, myself."  Connelly nods..."Unfortunately, that is true...that is why the Virtual Adepts and Etherites are two of the most important traditions...because they are able to clowly counter the work of science from the Technocracy, with the same subtley the Technocrats used against us. You should not be trying to tear things down...you should be trying to find away to show to the sleepers that live *CAN* be better, more fulfilling by stepping beyond their technological conveniences...  Pobble is lying flat on his back. His face is smeared with dried crusty blood, from a big gash/scratch across his forehead. He ignores Keene's hand, reaching instead for a pill box attached to his skirt by safety pin.  "They ain't countering science, they use it. They'd be as fucked without it as the Union fucks. So.. what've you done lately to stop the calcification?" he sounds a little dazed and warble-esq. That last batch of pain killers were probably One Strength Level Too High. OSLTH (tm).  Connelly looks at Daisy,"And...what are the Sleepers slaving for now? The fact that there are sleepers now who try things like seances, that one can go to a book store anf find steadily increasing new-age sections, and the fact that the old, pre-christian religions that were targeted by both the technocracy's pogrom and Chorister apathy are slowly returning...  Dyne wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Dyne has arrived.  "Walkways," Daisy comments, jerking a thumb toward the cave. "Always did like walkways. Concrete ones. So we're not stepping in the water and whatnot. A cure for the plague for everyone? I like that. I'm pretty fuckin' big on democracy. Aqueducts, too, 'cept for the lead thing. When's the last time you heard of anyone getting eaten by a dragon? They're almost extinct, and a damn good thing, too."  She pulls her hands out of her pockets, one out of each. One has a lighter, the other a cigarette. The former lights the latter, and she takes a good long drag.  "Everything that's wrong with the Traditions is in the Republic," she comments, stabbing the point of her cigarette at Connelly. "I'm fuckin' convinced Plato was a Hermetic. Maybe the first Hermetic. Everyone's ruled by philosopher-kings, who can do whatever the fuck they want, and everyone relies on the philosopher-kings for everything. The plebes till the fields and mine gold and do whatever the enlightened -- the Awakened -- tell them to. Aristotle, on the other hand; Aristotle lays it out straight. Aristotle tells you exactly what you have to do to patch up your wounds, to make a steam engine, to balance your humours. You can do it at home by yourself. I figure once the Traditions finish carving up the Technocracy, they'll tear right into each other to decide who rules. It's a marriage of convenience."  Connelly looks at Pobble,"What have I done? Sir...I heard you were a doctor...I do not see how you keep your medical license like you do...but...I work in the emergency for my face to sleepers...and...you ever spend time there...you know that every life you save puts something back..even if it just means that a mother doesn't have to grieve over the loss of her son...and, by not keeping my own religious beliefs hidden like most of the medical professionals do...I have had times already where someone asked me to explain it...which may not have any fruits immediately, but..oneday it will...  Dyne pops out of the hole, a small flat black box of some sort in his left hand and in his right hand a lit cigarette. He glances at the box then, then starts to walk towards the tree line of the forest with a brisk pace, the glowing ember giving away his location as he moves.          Keene makes the offer, as that's the polite thing to do. When Pobble chooses not to take his hand, Keene retracts it and straightens up, smoothing his lapels. While he can ignore Daisy -- he usually does -- Connelly's statements are too discordant with his beliefs to ignore. He looks intently at Connelly as she decides to go ad hominem on him, and for the first time in recent memory his eyes thin. Keene has finally reached his extremely high BCM threshold. Yet, he remains diplomatic. Politely, with an even tone, he offers his counterpoint.         "I believe your minority faith has blinded you to the objective facts of our situation. Do you really think the Technocracy actually went to the trouble of hunting down non-Christian religions? For that matter, do you think the Technocracy has /any/ religion? They deal with pure science and reason, not faith: and faith exists within science, as the old ways manifest within the new machines. The symbols have always been there, and will always /be/ there. It's just a matter of adapting to what people believe is magical."         "The time of dragons and the stone tower on the hill has passed, Doctor. The past cannot be made again; not only do the Sleepers not want any such thing, but ultimately neither do we."  Dyne wanders off toward the forest in the distance, eventually disappearing into the trees. Dyne has left.  Dave the Monkey, perhaps empathically picking up on Pobble's thinking mutters 'Blah blah blah blah..'. This at Connelly's statement.  Pobble takes his new pain killer. Or maybe its an anti-pain killer. He phbts. "I'm not an MD, I'm a PhD innit." he sighs, pulling an amusing face as the blue pill dissolves in his mouth. "Treating the facking sick doesn't count as fighting the war love." The man sighs, pushing himself up onto his elbows. "Healing the sick doesn't diminish the Union's stranglehold on Reality. Just keeps those fuckers alive to propogate the technocratic paradigm."  Connelly smiles at Daisy.."You may very well be right...if the traditions stay at eachothers throats the way they have been over the years, it is probably what is going to happen..." She looks at Keene,"I think you miss the point..when the technocracy first started up, it used the Catholic church, an insitution already set up and ruling most of the world, to unify under one religion. Once everything is unified under one belief structure, then it is easier to tear that belief in something beyond the normal down...And..personally, I do not want to see the old periods returned...I would love to see something greater, where one can walk the streets and feel joy at life...not have to worry about who might be in the darkened alley...for me, deep down, the core of the matter is hope...faith, regardless of the religion, will give people hope....but...finding other things is not that easy..." She looks at Pobble,"And...that is why I am an ER Doctor...By moving among those who are near death, I can give people just a little bit more hope than they had before...  "S'far as I'm concerned," Daisy snaps bitterly, "a priestess is just another sort of priest, and the only thing priests are good for is makin' intestines for strangling kings with."  Abel wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Abel has arrived.  Pobble says, "Eh. When did the Catholic church rule most of the world?" Pobble finally sits back up, shaking his head a little. That cigarette he's been clutching since waking up is finally lit and inhaled. "Giving people hope is all well and good, but your every fackin day joe normal gives people hope, doesn't help any on the grander scale does it..""  Abel walks out of the Hole in the hill, carrying his Guitar. He seems to have a bounce to his step and a rather dopey, thoughtful smile on his face.  Pobble is sitting on the ground, legs out in front of him.  Dave Monkey sits nearby, staring at a stolen TV playing video footage of a traffic nightmare.  Connelly sighs and shakes her head,"Daisy...One day, you will have to learn patience....I had heard you were a dreamspeaker.....I feel sorry for your mentor..." She shakes her head, and looks at Pobble,"Nothing any of us does individually has any effect on the grander scale..in fact..in the granderscale, anything we do in this city...will have no real effect...what is needed is to do something truly coordinated worldwide....."          Keene waits for Daisy and Pobble to have their say, and gives Connelly a chance to talk, before continuing:         "If such a thing were possible, I would be against it. I will explain that momentarily."         "First, Doctor," says Keene to Connelly, "let's go back to an earlier point you brought up. I think the mundanes had more of a hand in burning heretics and torturing unbelievers than the Technocracy. The Technocracy is not all-consuming and all-powerful, and surely wasn't a fraction of what it is now in the early days of this Ascension War. I won't give humanity a free pass, Doctor, by saying the Technocratic Devil made them do it. I know a great deal about human nature, both academically and from practical experience ... and violence is hard-wired into us. It takes a great deal to overcome, and even then it often pops up in the most surprising places and times."         He looks to Daisy evenly, then back to Connelly. "Humanity will fail you. People -- more specifically, an individual -- may not, because a person can be intelligent, while people are generally ignorant -- by their own choice. I don't believe in a mass Ascension for that reason; the vast majority of the inhabitants of this planet are simply not intended to be anything more than ordinary human beings who prefer to dwell in ignorance than have the responsibility that knowledge and power brings. They are happier, and better off, being led."         He puts a fresh cigarette between his lips. "Now, the matter of who gets to lead, well, I know I don't want to be in charge. It's easier for me to exist on the edge of this technopoly and use the same patterns and symbols that have repeated throughout human civilization to advance my own understanding of what it is to be Awakened. That, in the end, is a more fruitful and *far* less frustrating task than trying to get the great mass of fools in this world to think."         "Because, Doctor, they are happier not thinking at all, as we see today."  Abel sees the group and walks up toward them. "Hey everybody. Peace be with you." He goes quiet though as Keene speaks and listens to him, to see what kind of talk he has come into.  Pobble only just manages to not laugh at Connelly's last statement. "That is such a facking cop-out. I ain't never heard nothing so lame and defeatist." This is all he really has to add at this point, glancing to Daisy to let her pour on some more scorn and bitterness. He takes a long drag on the smoke and waggles some fingers at Abel.  Dave Monkey snuffles, rubbing his nose which is constantly in need of blowing all of a sudden.  "You don't even know who we're fighting, do you," Daisy says. Her tone is as bitter as dust. Leaving her stolen television, she walks walks off toward the ruins. Daisy begins down the hill and toward the Ruins. Daisy has left.  Connelly shakes her head,"Wouldn't you? Ignorance is bliss...if you do not believe there is a mugger out there, then you will not fear him...personally...nothing would make me happier for the Techocracy and Traditions to stop, take a look around, and work towards a common goal of bettering humanity...but..that is not going to happen..Unless that happens, we *ARE* hunted by the technocrats...we cannot do the will-working that would bring about a world where people can at least feel safe in their own homes without making up stories of how 'that cannot happen to me'...because the technocrats forced the belief in things like 'miracles' from the Concensus....and there is why hope is the Core of the War...if you create hope, then, you can make the people open for more things, and thus, slowly weaken Paradox until we have a world where we can guide the sleepers..not rule them...but guide them  Abel nods to Pobble and blinks at the Monkey. Then he sits and just listen to the argument at hand.  "What the fuck?" says Dave Monkey. He doesn't seem to realize he's spoken however, looking about at Pobble and shooting him an evil gaze. "Keep your thinking to yourself fuckface." it mutters.  Pobble looks at Connelly in disbelief, ignoring the monkey. "What'n the hell.. this all isn't about making the world better, and making the world a safer place to live. Shit. If we left it to the Union the world would be a fabulous place to live in your estimation. Safe, productive and efficient. I'd get up, and go to work looking forward to doing my job the best I could, and then the joy of comming home to my single perfect genofixed child. Woo fucking hoo." he shakes his head, taking an angry draw on the cigaretty. "What the fuck are you talking about woman?". That last pill seems to have given him a bit of clarity, and when he's thinking clearly it seems his accent drops away a bit, making him a little more comprehensible.          Keene is considerably less hostile than Pobble. Openly, anyway.         "Guide them, heh," says Keene, lighting up with his cheap plastic lighter while giving a Queen Wave briefly to Abel. "I saw this on a t-shirt, once: if you're not the lead dog, the view doesn't change very often. The person who made that t-shirt had a great insight into the workings of the world."         He takes a long drag, blowing a plume of smoke directly overhead before continuing. "You say to create hope, because that will allow magick back into the world. I don't follow. If we create hope, something happens that makes people's beliefs broaden? Some of the most hopeful people out there are people who cling desperately to something and blot everything else out but what they believe in. Hope by itself won't do it. The only way to make people accept other points of view -- or the existence of a consensual reality -- is with knowledge. Knowledge, gnosis, wisdom, whatever you would call it: that is what opens minds."  Dave the Monkey mutters, "Heptessence."  Abel blinks when he hears the Monkey curse, not having expected it to talk, let alone swear.  Connelly sighs,"I said safe...I did not say set in stone....there is a difference...the world the technocrats want is one where..you cannot walk out, look at the sky, and dream of flying..." She looks to Keen,"And...Hope..I am talking real hope, is believing in the impossible...in essence...when we work magic, we are imposing out own hopes onto reality...not our desires, not our whims, but our hopes.."  Dave the Monkey looks across at Abel, not having noticed him before. He blinks back, looking the man over as if suprised by something.  Abel waves to the Monkey a little, though still confused looking, still keeping half an ear on the argument, but still refraining from getting involved just yet.  Pobble says, "That again there is a boatload of crap. If I want some shit to happen, I dont hope it comes about. Gee, I hope I facking with the lottery. No, I do the math. I drop the reality breaking acid and break the world so that it becomes what I facking want it to." he shakes his head, "I dont rub my magic johnson and hope my dreams come true. What complete and utter bullshit." He clambers to his feet, sucking on the cigarette as if it's filter were bricked up.  He reaches into his little baggy, hidden under his dress and pulls out a syringe. It seems to be loaded with a thick goo. He crouches back down and forces the stuff out onto an oversized blade of grass."  //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es).          Keene puts things a bit more politely, once again.         "You may hope," says Keene, actual passion entering his countanence as the conversation draws nearer to his core beliefs, "but I *Will*. There is no hope in what I do, only resolve, knowledge and mystic strength. Reality bends to me because I Will it to change, because I have the power in me to demand it to come to heel."         He takes his cigarette out of his mouth and gestures with it, ash trickling off the end. "If I were to only wish my desires onto the world, I would be destroyed from the inertia of reality alone, and rightfully so. A timid Hermetic is one that was poorly raised. Virtue for lack of strength is not virtue: it is only when you have the power, the Will to do good or ill that virtue can be seen."  Pobble switches syringes, pulling a smaller one from his baggie and adding a much lighter fluid to the mix. He waggles this about with his finger, massaging the blade of grass between his fingers..  //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 7          For a total of 1 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Connelly nods..."Perhaps that is how you see it...I do not see it like that...it is hard for me to put into words....it is more...I hope...my Avatar guides me, and reality shapes to my desire...that is how I see it...I do not see it as beating reality to do what I want.."  Abel watches Pobble but continues to Listen to Keene and Connelly.  Pobble continues to mix the chemicals, and leans down further to add some god honest saliva to the mix. This seems to do the trick, and the blade of grass begins to grow as if suddenly emerged in a boatload of ubermagickal manure. Which in a way it has been.   The experience doesn't seem to go to well for the good Doctor however, and he winces and offers a slight grunt. Looking up to Dave he says, "Oi, fucker. Come 'ere." "That was whim." "And you said it wasn't desire, and now you say it is." says Pobble.          Keene has difficulty parsing Connelly's methodology, which he doesn't bother to conceal. He seems honestly perplexed that somebody could actually do what Connelly is saying and get anything done.         "So," says Keene, trying to put the concept together, "your Avatar decides whether or not you should do something, and then if the two of you -agree- you wish /really/ hard and it just *happens*?"  Connelly wells..."Yes...is that now it works for everyone? Both you and your Avatar have to agree...." She frowns,"We all saw what happened when my Avatar and I disagreed with Jess.....I could have saved her...but...my Avatar essentially...said no..."          This revelation actually puts Keene at a loss for words. He stands there, with this blank look of non-comprehension on his face, and stares at Connelly in silence for several seconds.  Dave the Monkey gets up from tv and proffers his cigar to Pobble. The Doctor takes the cigar and has a puff, but also breathes out through the cigar. He quickly passes the thing back to the monkey, as if it were on fire. Dave grabs it and takes a quick draw, and to those unfamiliar with the act its as if someone had shot the little critter full of heroin. He falls back with a quiet 'Wheeee..'  Pobble seems relieved, but stares at Connelly blankly. "That is fucked."  Connelly blinks at the...confused reactions around her.....looking confused herself....  Abel's face suddenly goes blank with a look of pain in his eyes at the mention of Jess and her death, and his grey eyes grow distant, remembering.  Pobble shakes his head, looking somewhere between confused and disgusted and confused. Stubbing out his cigarette he picks up the Monkey, who is in some euphoric state of consciousness. He looks at Keene, going to say something but just shrugs. At a loss. He points at the box. "I'll be asleep.".  The man heads over to the box, and climbs in, with his monkey. The top closes up, and that's the last of that.          It takes Keene a second or two to create a cogent reply to the information presented, but he eventually comes up with something.         "So that girl, the one who tried to sit on the Tenth Chair ... you couldn't save her, because your Avatar told you that you could not."         He waves distractedly at Pobble, keeping his attention on Connelly. "Why didn't your Avatar let you?"  Abel shakes his head to clear it and stands. "Like I think I need to go and do some thinking about what you guys are talking about."  Connelly frowns,"It just would not let me...perhaps it knew the action would be futile...."  Connelly shakes her head,"That is one thing...my Avatar...does not like wasting effort....if she thinks long run, the action would be....futile...she will tell me...."          "Futile," says Keene, like one would say a foreign word.  Abel shakes his head. "Doesn't sound hopeful to me," he says quietly, then He picks up his guitar and heads toward the forest. Abel wanders off toward the forest in the distance, eventually disappearing into the trees. Abel has left.  Connelly shakes her head,"That is why I am here...I temper my Avatar's practicality with my idealism...sometimes, I do not agree with my Avatar..."          "So you're just going to let your Avatar say when and when you can't act, is that it?" asks Keene, ashing his cigarette again. "You'll just sit there and take it, even when you want to act, because your Avatar -- a part of /you/, something that is ultimately /your/ spirit -- says to do this or not do that."         He puts his cigarette in his mouth, puffing on it like a chimney. "Well, Doctor, if you can live with that, fine. That's not how I run my affairs. I will not bend knee to my truculent Avatar, for it is not it that makes magick. It is *I*, and my Will, that makes magick. And if my Avatar told me not to act to save one of my friends from a horrible fate, I would tell him to fuck off."         The screaming in his mind grows louder. Keene chooses to ignore it. "*I* am the magus, *it* is my spirit. We are one, but it is *I* who is the master. For all of its power, it is my slave, and will do my Will. I can live no other way."  Connelly shakes her head,"You avatar is your guide, and your partner...not a slave..."          "Partners don't stop you from doing what needs to be done, Doctor."  Connelly frowns,"I have seen it done...when there is nothing that can be done to save a patient, one doctor has had to tell another that it was futile...because it was just not within the abilities of either to do that...and....Jess...I could have saved her that time, perhaps....but...she would have tried again...."  Hiro wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Hiro has arrived.  Hands wedged in his labcoat's pockets -- wedged jurrasic-deep; deep enough to be covered in a layer of limestone -- Hiro comes strolling up over the crest of a hill, bobbing his head wordlessly to an externally inaudible beat. A fat spliff jutts out from one corner of his mouth, glowing bright orange-red in the Realm's eternal dusk.          Keene is standing by a stolen television set with a VCR on top of it. The screen is inexplicably glowing blue, probably because the tape has fully rewound and is not playing. A short distance away is Pobble's cardboard box, which is closed up snugly.         Nearby Keene is Connelly, who is talking to Keene. Keene is smoking, and has a particularly grim look on his face. Then he speaks.         "If that's how you deal with it, that's how you deal with it. I didn't know Jess, so I'm not one to say if she wouldn't have done the same thing again if somebody had acted. But I will say this."         He takes a long drag on his cigarette. "I will say this, Doctor. Your Avatar doesn't always know what the right thing to do is. It is just as finite as you are. You have to trust your /own/ wisdom, control your /own/ Will, if you're ever going to get anywhere in this world. Don't let your Avatar or anybody else tell you what you should or should not do. Be your own person. Stand on your own two feet, and declare to the universe that you Are, and there's not a damned thing anybody can do about it."         "That, to me, is what being Awakened is."  Connelly shrugs,"Then again...is not the nature of being Awakened also to stress the fact that, when all is said and done, we are all individuals, and, we all have different relationships with our Avatars.....Maybe the Technocrats all have the same identical belief's for their avatars...but...at least we *CAN* disagree....          "I won't try to change your mind," says Keene. "I don't believe I have a monopoly on universal Truth. But I know people, Doctor Connelly. I know what human nature is, and I believe the only way to get anywhere is to be your own man."         He smooths his lapels with the sides of his thumbs, cigarette locked between his lips. "You are your own person. You are not your Avatar, you are not your Tradition. You *are* yourself. That's the only person you're accountable to."  Cruising to a stop to form a third point in the Connelly-Keene faceoff, Hiro extracts a hand from his pocket; plucking the spliff from between his lips. He scrutinizes the tip wordlessly, exhaling a long, narrow stream of smoke. No commentary for the argument, aside from a faint snort.  Connelly shakes her head,"No....we are all acountable to more than just ourselves....it is just that many times, we do not see that until it is too late....."          Keene smiles thinly, glancing at Hiro and giving him a sideways head-bob in greeting. Then he looks back to Connelly.         "We all may have to /answer/ to different people or institutions, but there's a difference between answering to someone and being /accountable/ to them. I have to answer to any of the Masters in my House, or any of them in the Order: but I do this because of their power and station more so than any fundamental moral authority they may have over me. /That/ basic accountability rests only in my mind, because I am the one who ultimately benefits or loses from what I do."  Connelly nods..."As do any innocents who may get caught in the crossfire, or helped in the beneficial fall out of your actions...as an Awakened...we are accountable to the Sleepers we harm or help, and to Paradox...."  A slow, head bobbing nod in response. Hiro is -- most definitely -- stoned out of his gourd. In the habit of all humankind observing tennis matches and ethical debates, he lets his wobbly-eyed gaze flicker back and forth between the two verbal combatants. A fresh drag on his blunt, a lungful and a half of smoke held in.          "I am not accountable to the great mass of humanity," says Keene. "Nor do I truly answer to any of them. Their law is not the Code of Hermes. Their ignorance does not excuse them from trying to obstruct my quest for knowledge. I do not seek to harm them, but I will do what I must to continue my quest for understanding."         "Paradox, similarly, is a power to be answered to. But I am not accountable to it. It is a universal force like gravity or inertia that must be reckoned with, but it has no moral authority. I respect its power to do me harm and avoid incurring its wrath, but it has no intrinsic right to limit me or make me act in any particular way."  Connelly nods..."As you choose...."          "As I Will," says Keene.  Exhale: a swirling cone of sicky-sweet ganja smoke, streaming from between Hiro's pursed lips. He idly scratches at the nape of his neck, sniffs once at Keene's comment, and promptly settles into 'ignore Keene's rant' mode. Instead, he heads over to examine the contents of Pobble's cardboard box, sticking first his nose, and then an arm into the thing's depths.  A primate screech, followed shortly by "Get your hand outta there, bugger" from the box; not, notably, Pobble's voice. Hiro stumbles backwards, nearly dropping his spliff, and stares sullenly at the cardboard palace, rubbing at his apparently injured hand. "Fucking chimp," he mutters in the box's direction.  Keene looks over towards Hiro and the incident. He snorts, grey-white smoke leaving his nose from his burning cancer stick, and returns his attention to Connelly. "It's been real," he comments, "but I should probably get my friend over there somewhere to have a nice lie-down before he hurts himself."  Connelly nods,"Perhaps you should..and..." She holds out her hand,"Jane, of the Verbena.."  It's a fluid, practiced motion, like an Akashic Zen-driven kata; Keene somehow produces a business card from up his sleeve while he puts out his hand to shake, giving the Verbena a handshake and leaving the card in her hand. "Steve Keene," he says. "Invisible College. It was a pleasure to engage in some critical debate." He then turns, moving over to try to intercept Hiro and lead him off somewhere. "Good evening."  "Huh?" asks Hiro, the first words he's mumbled since his untimely arrival. He stares blankly in Keene's direction, as if trying to puzzle out his demeanor, and thereby gain insight on the garbled combination of syllables he's distantly managed to make out. "You want some, or summat?" he asks, waving the spliff vaguely as he falls into step -- automatically -- beside the teflon-skinned PR flak.  Connelly smiles,"You handle debates better than Daisy..um..that is her name, right?"  "Daisy," says Keene. "Daisy Inscrutable, that's what she calls herself. For a craft name, it's not so bad. At least it's not something Goddamn ridiculous, like Penny Dreadful." As Hiro obediently falls in line, he begins leading him back up the waterway to the exit. "Be well, Doctor."  Connelly smiles,"I will..."  Hiro waves the spliff under Keene's nose for several more moments, mumbling, before taking another heavy drag. "Streetlight rave," he mumbles. "Deejay cheat inna house. thump thump thump...," before he gets even more incoherent, he stumbles off down the hill.  >> Hiro and I go outside to smoke reefer.  Allan Gardens - Tropical Conservatory  Obvious exits: Entrance    Back Door      Hiro appears from the door behind the two pillars, and slips out from between them. Hiro has arrived.  Keene walks out of the Realm, not too soggy for his efforts. He looks somewhat mentally drained from the endeavor. He heads over to a bench and sits down, gesturing for the spliff to come his way once he's settled in.  Wordlessly, Hiro slumps down onto the bench beside Keene, drawing himself up into a self-protective ball -- heels propped on the bench's edge, arms folded across his knees. He passes the spliff across to the other Hermetic, mumbling, "And people wonder why we have no respect for the 'Benas."  "They do?" asks Keene, taking a ginger toke on the spliff. He pauses to savor it before slowly releasing the smoke, passing it back. "Isn't it fucking self-evident?"  "I mean, I've willfully demolished the majority of my higher mental functions with a multicolored universe of mind-altering chemicals," Hiro continues, accepting the spliff -- which, by this point, is little more than a thumb-length stub. "And I ain't like that."  Keene chuckles vaguely, taking his ever-present flask out of his jacket and unscrewing the lid. "Do you know how she thinks magick works?" he asks. "I got it out of her today while we were talking."  "Willin t'bet s'somethin' vaginal. Or she like eats magic pac-man shit-pellets of avatar dookie from the astral plane." Hiro's still coasting on this side of coherent, although just barely. He takes another languid hit from the blunt, puffing leisurely before filling his lungs.  Keene snorts back a giggling fit, willing the unbidden laughter down so he can take a swig from his flask. He doesn't offer it to Hiro until /after/ he says: "Achem, achem, quote. When we work magic, we are imposing our hopes onto reality. Not desires, not whims, not even Will, but hopes. I fucking shit you not, she said this."  Chase steps into the conservatory from the front entrance. Chase has arrived.  "Whereupon," Hiro drones, digging through an inside pocket of his labcoat to produce a cheap bic, "I suppose some kind of hope-fairy moulds these -- with the aid of eidelon-dooie -- into beautiful shit-sculptures of awazzawakenned weeul." He's hard to hear at any kind of distance; the words are a mumbled garble. He applies the flame to the tip of the blunt, puffing on it as he does so. Apparently, it isn't burning evenly enough for his liking.  Keene is sitting on a bench next to Hiro. They are apparently talking smack about somebody by the character of their voices and their expressions. Keene, when Hiro doesn't capitalize on his offer of the flask, takes a swig, caps it and puts it away. "No, no, it gets better," he says. "Not only does she just /hope/ to make things happen, but she's gotta play a game of Mother May I with her God damned Avatar."  Not the time one would expect to find a crowded tropical conservatory. Never the less, walking through the flora and fauna, Chase comes a stomping about. Hands occupied by a small beaker filled with some brown sludge and a hint of blue liquid, the punk wonders into this area with a preoccupied frown. Like a moth to the flame, his acute sense of smell registers the faint scent of weed. *sniff sniff* "Eh? What's this then..."  "Che, my man," Hiro's voice raises perhaps half a decibel, and he waves the dwindling blunt in Chase's direction. He's hunched down beside Keene, knees drawn up to his chest, one arm across his knees. "I bet the pig could kick her avatar's ass," he ammends, helpfully.  "The monkey could do it, drunk," says Keene, looking over at the approaching Chase. Keene sits comfortably on the bench with an easy, confident posture, feet on the floor, head back, shoulders relaxed. "Hello Chase."  "'Sup niggers." Somehow that sounds rather lame coming out of some whiteboy's mouth, especially because Chase didn't pepper it with some hip hop flavor. His heavy boots step up, hands raising the beaker to the light for a close inspection before slipping it into a pocket. A callused hand reaches out for the offered smoke, the thick man drags like pro. Chase stands for a moment in silence, his chest expanded with his hit. He speaks some more, weed leaks from between his stained teeth. "You talkin' some drunk monkeys over here?"  "Keene ran afoul'f that stupid Verbena ho," Hiro offers, helpfully. He scratches at the back of his neck again, frowning; the monkey probably gave him fleas.  "Not afoul," says Keene, quickly. "Daisy ran afoul of her, then Pob came in and made things more foul. I just wanted to see what her deal was."  Of course, Chase instinctively looks over his shoulder as Hiro speaks. Ever watchful, ever the paranoid one. "Which ho's this? There's so many of 'm." He hands the joint over to Keene.  "The stupid one." This, perhaps, actually manages to be less helpful than the first statement. Hiro's too high to be very watchful; he's presently scrutinizing his cheap plastic bic, trying to work a thumbnail under the metal childproof guard.  Chase says, "Cally?"  Keene accepts the joint graciously, takes another ginger toke from it, and passes it to Hiro afterward, slowly exhaling. Fortunately, Keene remembers her name. "Jane Connelly, Medicine Woman," he says, and thinks he's pretty damned clever at that. "She objected to the adventure my colleague here and his filthy assistant undertook today."  Teehee. Hiro giggles as his wacky adventure is mentioned, carefully retrieving the spliff's butt from between Keene's fingers. "Shit," is all he has to offer, chortling over the event in question. "Goddamn," comes the insightful ammendment. "Holy goddamn shit." The laughter takes a swerve towards cackling.  A cloud of weed is finally expelled from Chase, it builds above his head in a hallo of smoke. "'Aven't met 'r yet, think i know who yer talkin bout though." The punk shrugs, adjusting something in his pocket and he looks back down to Hiro. "'What's with the 'adventure', Mr. Gigglesworth?" He smiles crookedly in response to the clubber's fit.  Keene lets Hiro explain. This is /all/ him.  Hiro waves the joint frantically -- well, as frantically as his current state allows. "Dig this shit," he chortles, flicking a fat wad of ash off to the side. "Me'n Daze, we went and got these -- like, these, orange jumpsuits. And hardhats. And we go downtown. Financial district, dig." He takes a perfunctory hit on the spliff, his story curtly interrupted, before handing it over to Chase. He's had way too much, anyway. "And we -- I, yeah. You know those little drumkits? I wired a set of 'gator clips to the beat indicators, dropped it on breakbeats, and hooked up a kitchen timer -- and we wired the fucker to the streetlights' switching box at the intersection. And dropped a walkman 'n a breakbeats mix with some old speakers we dug up into the trash. At 'zactly Two-fifteen, it was rush hour rave, man."  That get's a chuckle, Chase reaches out and snatches up the blunt to take it's final puff. A slow drag, he'll make it last, and spark a new one from behind an ear. At one point, he's got two lit joint in his thin lips, then the older one falls to the floor and dies under his boot. Weed back to Keene. "Tits."  "Neh," acknowledges Hiro, his free hand wrapping back around the bicep opposite. "Some people got no 'preciation for art."  Keene accepts the joint and takes a long toke. As he exhales, he speaks. "Well, she didn't like that in the least, so a verbal confrontation broke out. Unfortunately, Daisy has little knowledge of practical rhetoric, and Pobble ... well, the man is a genius in the laboratory, but he too does not debate."  "Eh, well. There's always some twat with 'r panties in a knot." Fucker's starting to rhyme. "Lookit all the people that bitch at me..." Chase shrugs it off. "Whatever." A sniffle, he palms the back of his stubbled scalp. "Far as i'm concerned, shit like that's a deft decoy for the man. Keeps Union eyes off 'a real threats, 'n occupodo with some random hijinx. 'S long as you niggers deal with the heat, I say... up with Anarchy, up with bullshit."  "Such a ringing endorsement," says Keene.  As for Hiro? Hiro is smug. Stoned, but smug. "Union? Shit. From what I hear, locals don't know their ass from their elbow. We pulled off crazier shit in the Bay, and those assholes actually knew what they were doing." He cracks a yawn, blinking repeatedly. "'sides, shit. If we worried about the Man, you think we'd be in our business?"  The punk smiles in return, Chase doesn't do enthusiasm much it seems. "I'm all about you guys doin' whatever it is you guys do." But he manages to sound sincere when he says that. "'N no, i don' expect you to worry bout the man, cuase it's mostly my job. But fuck, give me a haller next time you do some wacki crap so i can move some product." Heh.  "Speaking of product," says Keene. "We should sit down and discuss the trade in private sometime. After all, we want to have a mutually beneficial business relationship." He smiles brightly.  "We didn' stick around much. Don't think you woulda slung a lot of coke t'the traffic cops what showed up," Hiro mumbles, eyes slowly drifting to half-mast. "Got some wicked visuals on m'camcorder. We'll have to throw that shit up on the video-wall at th'next party."  Eyes narrow on Keene minutely, Chase turns most of his attention to him. "You guys 'r slingin' then, eh? Mmmmm, there's some things you should know bout the trade up here. Toronto... 's an odd place. There's one big fish, 'n i been riding the coat tails."  Keene's lips purse. "We'll want to stay out of that guy's way, then. Who's the main operator?"  "Gideon Browne," Hiro coughs, wetly, and spits out a fat chunk of lung-butter on some enormously expensive fauna. A cigarette materializes, and he fits it between his lips: sparking it to life with his bic. "Thas my guess, 'tleast. We're meetin' him next week. Forgot t'mention. He wants me to rig a light setup for some titty club."  "Pffftf. Not that monkey." Chase looks down to Hiro, threatening to break back into a smile. "Naw, not at all." Absently, he rubbs his nose. "Course this conversation doesn't leave this place, eh?" The punk makes it a point to look at Keene and Hiro square in the eye, and directs his first finger at the ground.  "Yeah, 'course," Hiro answers automatically.  "Right then." Chase starts by slumping stiffly onto the bench, fingering out a piece of neon green chewing gum as he does. "The Yaks. Fuckin' ninja clan, they moved into town 'n a big fat way. Took over the China White market, which, at the time, was mine..." His square jaw begins to dig into the watermelon flavored gum. "So I made things 'tough' on 'm, 'n they cut me in 'cuase they recognized my skills. But... I dunno." A small bubble is blown and *popped*. "Dudes took out most of the Triads in one single night without a trace. Their grand pooba, 's trippy fuck." Callused fingers wave in gesture about the punk's bloodshot eyes. "There's nothin' inside his skull. 'S like, his soul's on vacation. No aura. Zero. Less than zero, even..."  "Dammit," says Keene. "It's the fucking magic ninjas."  Chase says, ".... magic ninjas."  Hiro stares blankly at Chase for a long moment. Then, to Keene -- his lips twist up at the edges, threatening to break into a grin. "Um, dude," he answers, shifting his attention back to Che. "You sayin' we gotta deal with some kinda fucked up soulless nephandus motherfucker?"  Keene nods once. "The ones that got talked about in the meeting. It's totally them." He can say this with a straight face. He /is/ Reynard the Fox.  Chase says, "I dunno what ta tell ya bout this dude." And truly, the punk seems to have been mystified by the magic ninjas, and their proper dubbing as such. *pop* "It's them, 'n i been makin' money by workin' under their umbrella. I wouldn't recommend you deal with this fucker at all, man. I never met anyone that didn't have an aura, and -wasn't- a 'bot'. I can't figure out what his game plan is yet, alls i know is these slants moved in like gangbusters."  "S'stupid iff'n you ask me. This ain' iron monkey. You can't just destroy the enemy clans and move in to become The Lightning Grandmaster with the feared Steel Wangshaw technique." Hiro drags on his cigarette moodily; all this talk of magic ninjas seems to have gotten him down. "See, if we had shit for a Union in this town, they'd already have taken care of those fuckers for us." "....And, since we don't, i don't think we cin make an enemy outta these cock-suckers. This typea headache requires manpower, not a council of cackling hens. Totally a job for the man..." Chase concludes, *pop*.  "Dunno. Think Cally should take them on with her Gundam suit." Snide? Hiro's got snideness in surplus. He takes a killing drag on his cigarette, before leaning sideways to crush it out on the bench.  Keene thins his lips. Now he's serious, or putting on the act thereof. "So what do they specialize in?"  "Right, watch 'm pull out their vorpal can-openners..." The punk retorts while shifting. A great many things under his long coat cause it to fold oddly against his squat frame. "Anyways, i'm tellin' you guys... ya'll should keep it low key. Don't step on boyo's toes, less yer a gamblin man like me."   Chase shifts his attention back to Keene, "They move alot of tar, they eat a lot of fish, and kill people real silent like. Other than that, the usual ninja Yakuza stuff i suppose."  Keene looks to Hiro. "Well, I suppose our club drugs probably won't get /too/ much attention..."  "I doubt Sum Phewl Kapow," strange to hear Hiro make racially derogatory language of the breed -- he's at least part slant. Then again, beyond a certain diffusive point, racial identity pretty much ceases to mean anything. "...cares much if we're doping candy kids up on cat tranquilizers."  "Question not the ways of the magic ninja, Hiro," says Keene.  A laugh and *pop*, Chase stands slowly wipping his hands on his pants for some reason. "Ya, you donkies'll prolly be under ninja radar if ya stick to dance halls. Course, i move product in some of those venues myself. But i'm sure we can come to some agreement. Buy me outta clubs you wanna work or somethin'..."  "Mmmngh," offers Hiro, slowly unfolding himself, and rising -- unsteadily -- to his feet. He sways back and forth for a long moment, attempting to employ Chase as a visual level. "We usually stay outta clubs," he answers. "Too much heat. Safer to just move at our parties. 'nyway, I've gotta go do some video editing. We gonna hook up t'morrow, Che? You were gonna help me with my chem homework." A flash of teeth.  "Day after tomorrow. Call me if ya got any more questions, Steve...." Chase says to Hiro and Keene respectively, still rubbing his nose. "Via con dios."  Seems the punk was about to leave as well, he flashes the duo the metal sign as his heavy boots take him towards the line of columns.

      Daisy shows video of the streetlight rave.  --  “Seems pretty fuckin' amenable to the giant airship over there," Daisy comments sourly, gesturing toward Team Ether's research station in the far distance. "If it's sentient, and I ain't talking about Tweedledum and Tweedledee the guardian spirits, then I can't imagine it would mind us not getting our feet wet. And if it does, then fuck it, 'cause these boots cost me sixty whole bucks and I'll be damned if I'm buying new ones just to traipse around in Fairyland."  As though to make her point, Daisy stabs the plug at the dirt a second time. This only provokes a shower of sparks punctuated by short bolts of violet electricity. She swears incoherently at the ground, kicking at the smouldering bits of grass and leaf kicked up by the discharge.  "Motherfucking shit eating god damn ...", she begins, then breaks off. "... oi, Keene. Is the Frozen North run on 110 or 220 volts?"  "110," says Keene. "220 is Europe. You can tell because they have funny-looking plugs."  Standingwater mumbles something about needing a blowgun and waves a hand dismissivly. The reeds revert back to grass. "Things are slowing down. Maybe someone should go sit in the chair."  "If it'll afford me some kind of /rest/, then fuck yeah," Alyx mumbles, in response to Standingwater's comment.  Connelly laughs,"I don't think anyone is *THAT* bored, Standingwater..."  Standingwater unlings the bow from his back and stretches out on the ground. "Well, I'm not doing it again. It sucked last time."  Alyx nnghs. "Anyone got paper 'n a pen?" she inquires, sitting up groggily. "Something I need t'do before I collapse. I'll forget otherwise."  Above the outlet, in block script, Daisy writes: 1 1 0. The sympathetic magick appears to actually work this time: when she plugs in the television, it springs to vibrant Technicolor life, painting the faces of the onlookers pale grey.  "Fuckin' A," she says proudly, hitting the 'play' button on the VCR. "It works."  The screen goes blue.  Standingwater rests the bow across his chest. "Can't help you. I left my pack in the Jeep. Too busy herding you safely here to remember to pick it up."  Kasui has arrived.  Connelly looks up and waves to Kasui!  "Hurray," monotones Keene, moving over to sit down on the cold, grass-covered Earth to watch whatever tape Daisy has decided to play.  As Kasui crests the hill, Daisy, Keene, Connelly, Standingwater, and Alyx are gathered around a television plugged into the grass. The television is turned on.   You're fairly sure there was no outlet there last time you checked.  In any case, a faint, blurry image springs up seconds after she turns it on. Toronto natives will recognize it as the downtown financial center. Hiro and Daisy -- or, rather, Hiro and Daisy shaped blurs -- are gathered around a junction box next to a traffic light. They appear to be mumbling to each other, but the microphone only picks up static and distant honking.  Standingwater grumbles about the damned machines destroying the art of storytelling. Yeesh. Lighten up.  Like a memory set adrift like bit of wood upon a stream, memories of a time long ago yet seemingly just beyond reach, Kasui flows into view clad like somone straight from the Meiji. Her voluminous oceanic blue hakama sway like waves about her legs as her zori-sandaled feet barely make a whisper upon the grass. The long topknot of a samurai flows down her back in an almost noble fasion as those midnight tresses ripple like liquid midnight. Left hand resting lightly upon th epommel of her clansword she pauses at the sight ahead of her and tilts he rhead to the side in abject curiosity...  Alyx flops down against the grass once more. Pen and paper be damned, she's sleeping now that Jamaia has quit throwing things at her.  Connelly blinks at Kasui, and smiles......  Keene rather blandly watches TV. Very slightly, as the minutes pass, his expression moves from neutral to a sense of impending doom.  Time passes. After a bit, Daisy hits fast-forward.  Daisy-in-the-video smokes one cigarette, and then another, and then another. She sits down on her toolbox, then she stands up. She throws something in the garbage. She spraypaints something on the ground, then disappears with Hiro -- who has completed whatever electronic work he was doing inside the junction box -- out of the frame.  The camera turns off.  Apparently several minutes later, Daisy reappears, half out of frame, eating a McDonalds cheeseburger in the back of a moving van. The camera is focused out the window. Time passes. All hell breaks loose.  There's cheering from inside the van -- Daisy screaming an incoherent and staticky 'fuck yeah!', Hiro giving a peace sign to the camera -- and at first it's not obvious what's happened. Then the camera focuses: two Cadilacs have T-boned in the middle of the intersection. Other cars are desperately trying to get around them. Most end up on the sidewalk. In the distance, outside the car, tinny techno music plays.  The music is playing in time with the blinking of the streetlights, which have altogether abandoned their appointed function and now simply provide a light show.  Keene stares in numb horror at the screen as Hiro and Daisy bring about several traffic accidents and general carnage. He knows enough about their modus operandi to know what they did, and how. He groans, putting his head in his hands, yet continues to smoke. He does this a lot.  Standingwater pulls the flute out of his hat band and plays along as best he can with the music on the tape. Not a bad effort.  Daisy-in-the-Realm and Daisy-in-the-video simultaneously proclaim, "That shit was rad," but Daisy-in-the-Realm adds, "for being totally wasted out of my mind. Shit. Just wanted to see what I did this morning."  She tilts her head, looks sidelong at Keene, and rubs at the stubble underneath her bob. She lets out a short burst of nervous laughter.  "Lookit that," she says to Standingwater, stabbing the tip of her wand in his direction. "Lookit that. Fuckin' technology in action, man. Try to get two moose to crash into each other at thirty miles per hour using less than ten dollars in equipment. Impossible, that's what it is."  Connelly laughs,"Daisy...Jamaia gould probably do that with less amount of equipment....  Standingwater sets down his flute and cranes his head back so he can look at Daisy, "Actually, I can do it without equipment. Just crank up their hormones to mating season levels."  Sandled feet whisper about the edges of the gathering as Kasui unobtrusively takes a few fluid paces forwards. Pausing again, she focuses upon the screen for a few moments and shakes her head noncommittaly.  Connelly smirks,"Now..please explain something to me Daisy....what purpose does that serve other than injuring sleepers, the very people we are trying to protect? How does that turn back the technocracy, bring wonder back to just one or two more people?"  Standingwater sets down his flute and cranes his head back so he can look at Daisy, "Actually, I can do it without equipment. Just crank up their hormones to mating season levels."  Alyx sleeps. Ever-so quietly....she dosen't snore, fidget, twitch or talk. Sleeping like a baby.  Keene smokes, head in his hands. It takes him a while to reconstruct his thought patterns to address this new self-inflicted disaster. He lifts his head, ashing his cigarette, and looks at Daisy flatly. "So," he says. "Why?"  Daisy fixes Connelly in an are-you-a-fucking-idiot? stare. The corners of her mouth twitch with irritation. A lesser version of the same glare is reserved for Keene.  "I'm sorry. I guess you didn't get the part where we ruined a shitload of mass-produced cars, exposed a bunch of idiot suits to some badass beats and general wonder, disrupted the financial heart of Canada for, hell, I dunno, four hours, and generally made it harder for people to go about their jobs making the world more boring?" She grins. On the sharp features of her face, it only makes her look like a rat. "Do you want me to rewind to that part?"  All Keene wanted was a rationale. He is remarkably permissive of this kind of behavior just so long as some sort of justification is given for it. Wonton, rampant destruction for its own sake is intolerable; wonton, rampant destruction for some Fight Club-style end is slightly more acceptable.  "Yeah, run it back," the suited Hermetic says. "Hopefully Chase comes by; I think this is up his alley."  Connelly sighs,"No, Daisy Incrutable, I do not think you understand..." She looks straight at the woman,"Yes..you ruined a bunch of cars...and did allt hat stuff....but...by doing so, you *HARMED* sleepers. I did not say make the world more interesting..I mean..have you ever looked into a child's eyes as he or she watched a street magician? Before you awoke, did you ever see something that made you feel a sort of sense of awe at the vastness of things?"  Kasui 's sad eyes settle for a moment on Daisy, a strange intensity within her gaze, before she simply shakes her head again and wanders onwards. She does not speak her opinion on the matter, she does not speak at all. She, simly, gives Connelly a brief nod and walks away thoughtfully.  Standingwater pinches the bridge of his sizable nose. "No point in preaching at her, Jane. She's the type to do it again just to spite you. And though I don't approve of the method, I do applaude the fact that she got out and actually did something. Unlike most of the worthless sacks of shit around here who are too busy fucking or whining to be bothered with accomplishing something."  "Unless you got some kind of magic wand that shoots rainbows and fairytales, I figure this is the best way to deal with them," Daisy comments, scratching behind her ear. Just in case, she taps the rewind button with the point of her toe. The crash runs by again in slow motion. "This effects everyone. This makes it just a little bit harder to do the dirty work of fucking over everything that matters. This ain't 'a child's eyes'. These are cold, stupid old men with hearts made of ashes and dust. They're the same cold, stupid old men that run the Hermetic Order --"  She turns her gaze toward Keene, shooting him a poisonous gaze. Shut up, it says. Don't argue with me.  "-- and they're the same cold, stupid old men that run the Chorus. And they're the same cold, stupid old men that run the Union and keep anyone, everyone, from getting getting that connection. Well, fuck children. /Fuck/ children, you stupid mick bitch. They're getting stomped out faster in every generation, and the fucking old men will win no matter how hard you try, because they're smarter than any of us -- smarter than anyone who still cares."  Connelly frowns,"Terrorism doesn't work...."  Somewhere on the plain, a box was left. The box was cold, silent and still.  Now it rumbles, and... well, it seems to belch. There's scrabbling against the inside of the top and then it pops open, spewing out the suited monkey and dress wearing doctor. From the looks of him, he doesn't look like it’s been an uncomfortable few hours in the box. He looks well rested, with a crusty coating of blood over his features. Reaching back into the box he pulls a cigarette from within, and looks across the grass for anyone nearby.  "Got you sheepfuckers a country, now din't it," Daisy snaps at Connelly.  Connelly points to Pobble,"Heck...ask him how much terrorism made him sympathize with the cause of an Ireland free from british rule."  Connelly shakes her head,"Yes, it got us a country..but it did not get us a nation...we are still fragmented, and...we are still at each others throats because of the terrorism used to force the brits to yield even a slight bit back to the people who should have always had it.  Pointed at already. Typical.  He looks to the source of the accent being levelled at him, and heads across after leaning down to light the monkey's fresh cigar.  "I don't give a flying fuck about British Rule to be honest.." Pobble looks a little confused, "Don't really mind terrorism either, as long as its directed the right way. ie. Away from me." He stops again, lighting his own cigarette. "I just find Irish people abrasive. Scrounging bastards." He pauses, adding "Bless their hearts." as if this makes it all okay.  "Bless their hearts," Daisy agrees.  Dave the Monkey says, "I'm Irish, you prick.". He throws a monkey fist at Pobble's leg as he says this. The Doctor stops and looks down at the monkey.  "No you ain't you twat." is the reply, and the blue haired, dress wearing, bloody faced tranny flicks ash at the suited cigar smoking monkey.  Keene glances across Pobble's features once he gets to his feet, noticing the blood. In an easy movement, he offers him three Wet Naps he snagged from some restaraunt from a back pocket. He says nothing, thinking now would be a good time not to draw too much attention to himself.  Pobble flashes a big fat grin at Keene and accepts the offering, "Cheers mucka." He hands one off to Dave who looks at it, and then throws it over his shoulder. "Wotcha?" he asks, presumably to Keene.  Connelly sighs, and stands up,"Well....I see you are young, still motivated by anger rather understanding...Tell, Miss Incrutable, do you have any family you care about? For your sake, I hope the answer is no...because...I have seen first hand what it is like to lose and almost lose someone you care about to terrorism.....  "Same old story," says Keene to Pobble in reply. He's just going to stay out of the crossfire between Connelly and Daisy. "Daisy and Hiro caused several car accidents today. They have it on tape." He gestures at the TV. "It's caused something of a stir. It's not nearly so bad as that /one/ time." What that may be remains a mystery. A dark look begins to gather on Pobble's features. The blue haired freakish boy's sunny demeanor slowly sinking into darker looks.  "Yeah, I saw. They taped it from the Hummer." he murmers at Keene, still staring at Connelly.  "The thing you forget, is that you're talking about religeon. Poxy religeon and occupation. That's nothing.. it means nothing. We're talking about war on a greater metaphysical scale. Ascension isn't a dream, it's a fucking struggle that many people seem to have forgotten."  Dave the Monkey nods solemnly, then takes a big toke on the cigar. "Oi, Pobs you freak. Take this a mo." Dr Steve takes the cigar, and the monkey runs back to the cardboard box, diving inside and rumaging.  "Actually, I don't fuckin' know who I lost or for what reason," Daisy says offhandedly, jamming her hands into the central pocket of her hoodie. Her poisonous glare turns back to Connelly. "You lost someone you care about. I'm sheddin' a single tear for you right now, honey. We all lose people."  Her sneer has turned into something virtually feral, and her hands ball into tight fists inside her jacket.  "It don't turn all of us into cowards."  Connelly shakes her head,"It is a struggle for the hearts and minds of the Sleepers, though...the way you two are fighting the war...we might as well just kill all sleepers....Try something different...try working with sleepers instead of doing things to harm them..it may not be completed in our life time...but...neither did the Technocracy's getting the strangle hold it has....  Connelly sighs.."In fact, The technocracy started by working the same way, I do believe..."  "And now we ain't living in hovels, slaving away for the Church and the State, now are we?", Daisy snaps.  From within the box, just a little way away there is a snorting sound. A long drawn out snorting. Then another. And a third.  This is followed by some sniffling, and Dave Monkey jumps back out of the box, running merrily back to the gathering, where he leaps to grab the cigar and hops down in front of the telly.  Pobble quirks a brow at Connelly. "Joe Public don't want us to work with them, they want to sit back watch cable, read their email and veg out with techno-easy living.."  Pobble falls backwards, as if he's just fainted. He lands on the ground, flat on his back with a slight 'Ow'.  Kasui wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Kasui has arrived.  Keene finishes off his cigarette as Pobble talks. He doesn't so much as flinch as Pobble falls down; this is pretty normal by Keene's standards. The suited man does, however, walk over and offer his hand to Pobble to help the dress-wearing gentleman back to his feet. "I kind of like indoor plumbing, myself."  Connelly nods..."Unfortunately, that is true...that is why the Virtual Adepts and Etherites are two of the most important traditions...because they are able to clowly counter the work of science from the Technocracy, with the same subtley the Technocrats used against us. You should not be trying to tear things down...you should be trying to find away to show to the sleepers that live *CAN* be better, more fulfilling by stepping beyond their technological conveniences...  Abel has connected.  Pobble is lying flat on his back. His face is smeared with dried crusty blood, from a big gash/scratch across his forehead. He ignores Keene's hand, reaching instead for a pill box attached to his skirt by safety pin.  "They ain't countering science, they use it. They'd be as fucked without it as the Union fucks. So.. what've you done lately to stop the calcification?" he sounds a little dazed and warble-esq. That last batch of pain killers were probably One Strength Level Too High. OSLTH (tm).  Connelly looks at Daisy,"And...what are the Sleepers slaving for now? The fact that there are sleepers now who try things like seances, that one can go to a book store anf find steadily increasing new-age sections, and the fact that the old, pre-christian religions that were targeted by both the technocracy's pogrom and Chorister apathy are slowly returning...  Kasui has left.  "Walkways," Daisy comments, jerking a thumb toward the cave. "Always did like walkways. Concrete ones. So we're not stepping in the water and whatnot. A cure for the plague for everyone? I like that. I'm pretty fuckin' big on democracy. Aqueducts, too, 'cept for the lead thing. When's the last time you heard of anyone getting eaten by a dragon? They're almost extinct, and a damn good thing, too."  She pulls her hands out of her pockets, one out of each. One has a lighter, the other a cigarette. The former lights the latter, and she takes a good long drag.  "Everything that's wrong with the Traditions is in the Republic," she comments, stabbing the point of her cigarette at Connelly. "I'm fuckin' convinced Plato was a Hermetic. Maybe the first Hermetic. Everyone's ruled by philosopher-kings, who can do whatever the fuck they want, and everyone relies on the philosopher-kings for everything. The plebes till the fields and mine gold and do whatever the enlightened -- the Awakened -- tell them to. Aristotle, on the other hand; Aristotle lays it out straight. Aristotle tells you exactly what you have to do to patch up your wounds, to make a steam engine, to balance your humours. You can do it at home by yourself. I figure once the Traditions finish carving up the Technocracy, they'll tear right into each other to decide who rules. It's a marriage of convenience."  Connelly looks at Pobble,"What have I done? Sir...I heard you were a doctor...I do not see how you keep your medical license like you do...but...I work in the emergency for my face to sleepers...and...you ever spend time there...you know that every life you save puts something back..even if it just means that a mother doesn't have to grieve over the loss of her son...and, by not keeping my own religious beliefs hidden like most of the medical professionals do...I have had times already where someone asked me to explain it...which may not have any fruits immediately, but..oneday it will... Dyne pops out of the hole, a small flat black box of some sort in his left hand and in his right hand a lit cigarette. He glances at the box then, then starts to walk towards the tree line of the forest with a brisk pace, the glowing ember giving away his location as he moves.  Keene makes the offer, as that's the polite thing to do. When Pobble chooses not to take his hand, Keene retracts it and straightens up, smoothing his lapels. While he can ignore Daisy -- he usually does -- Connelly's statements are too discordant with his beliefs to ignore. He looks intently at Connelly as she decides to go ad hominem on him, and for the first time in recent memory his eyes thin. Keene has finally reached his extremely high BCM threshold. Yet, he remains diplomatic. Politely, with an even tone, he offers his counterpoint.  "I believe your minority faith has blinded you to the objective facts of our situation. Do you really think the Technocracy actually went to the trouble of hunting down non-Christian religions? For that matter, do you think the Technocracy has /any/ religion? They deal with pure science and reason, not faith: and faith exists within science, as the old ways manifest within the new machines. The symbols have always been there, and will always /be/ there. It's just a matter of adapting to what people believe is magical."  "The time of dragons and the stone tower on the hill has passed, Doctor. The past cannot be made again; not only do the Sleepers not want any such thing, but ultimately neither do we."  Dyne wanders off toward the forest in the distance, eventually disappearing into the trees.  Dave the Monkey, perhaps empathically picking up on Pobble's thinking mutters 'Blah blah blah blah..'. This at Connelly's statement.  Pobble takes his new pain killer. Or maybe its an anti-pain killer. He phbts. "I'm not an MD, I'm a PhD innit." he sighs, pulling an amusing face as the blue pill dissolves in his mouth. "Treating the facking sick doesn't count as fighting the war love." The man sighs, pushing himself up onto his elbows. "Healing the sick doesn't diminish the Union's stranglehold on Reality. Just keeps those fuckers alive to propogate the technocratic paradigm."  Connelly smiles at Daisy.."You may very well be right...if the traditions stay at eachothers throats the way they have been over the years, it is probably what is going to happen..." She looks at Keene,"I think you miss the point..when the technocracy first started up, it used the Catholic church, an insitution already set up and ruling most of the world, to unify under one religion. Once everything is unified under one belief structure, then it is easier to tear that belief in something beyond the normal down...And..personally, I do not want to see the old periods returned...I would love to see something greater, where one can walk the streets and feel joy at life...not have to worry about who might be in the darkened alley...for me, deep down, the core of the matter is hope...faith, regardless of the religion, will give people hope....but...finding other things is not that easy..." She looks at Pobble,"And...that is why I am an ER Doctor...By moving among those who are near death, I can give people just a little bit more hope than they had before...  "S'far as I'm concerned," Daisy snaps bitterly, "a priestess is just another sort of priest, and the only thing priests are good for is makin' intestines for strangling kings with."  Pobble says, "Eh. When did the Catholic church rule most of the world?" Pobble finally sits back up, shaking his head a little. That cigarette he's been clutching since waking up is finally lit and inhaled. "Giving people hope is all well and good, but your every fackin day joe normal gives people hope, doesn't help any on the grander scale does it..""  Abel walks out of the Hole in the hill, carrying his Guitar. He seems to have a bounce to his step and a rather dopey, thoughtful smile on his face. Pobble is sitting on the ground, legs out in front of him.  Dave Monkey sits nearby, staring at a stolen TV playing video footage of a traffic nightmare.  Connelly sighs and shakes her head,"Daisy...One day, you will have to learn patience....I had heard you were a dreamspeaker.....I feel sorry for your mentor..." She shakes her head, and looks at Pobble,"Nothing any of us does individually has any effect on the grander scale..in fact..in the granderscale, anything we do in this city...will have no real effect...what is needed is to do something truly coordinated worldwide....."

      Streetlight rave!  --  It is telling that Daisy did not have to go to any particular trouble to find a hazard-orange jumpsuit. There was one stuffed in the bottom drawer of her dresser. The hard hat, though, was an expense, and the goggles nearly cleaned out Keene's credit card, which, as Daisy found out recently, is actually taken out in Hiro's name.  All things form a perfect circle, if viewed at a certain resolution. As above, so below.  Digressions aside, Daisy herself, carrying a toolbox under one arm and looking perfectly conspicuous, is wasted out of her mind. The urban jungle is a real 'urban jungle'. Quetzals fly overhead. Peccaries dart and squeak underfoot. Bankers seen out of the corner of her eye sport jutting penis-gourds.  Hiro does not look particularly 'better' in a canvas proletarian's uniform. The hard-hat -- off-white and stamped with a faded municipal seal -- doesn't do much for him, either. He looks, really, like an overweight city technician ... which is the entire point.   Carrying a satchel made of the same rough material as his overalls, Hiro enters the financial district on foot: joining the throngs of workers milling about during their lunch break. His own eyes are concealed behind opaque Unibomber shades -- a measure to conceal his own condition, evidenced by his dime-sized pupils. The shiteating grin, however, is more difficult to obfuscate.  Disguise is not Daisy's strong suit. Disguise is especially not Daisy's strong suit when amped to the gills on any number of high-grade disassociatives, entactogens, and stimulants. The best that can be said for her disguise -- which, to her credit, manages to resemble in most details an anonymous proletarian -- is that any passers-by will describe her eyes as being entirely black, when in fact they are brght blue.  This cunning adaptation is achieved by swallowing a palmful of pills of various description, and could likely not be accomplished again.  Daisy's box contains exactly three things, in fore-to-aft order: a portable speaker (left), one (1) Walkman containing a mix tape courtesy of Hiro, and a portable speaker (right). The latter bears a Ramones sticker, which is the sum total of Daisy's contribution to this idea.  Proferrs  Shoulder to shoulder with the neverending stream of salary men, Hiro does not jostle through the crowd: he moves with the casual, bored demeanor of a working man. This is because he is concentrating, largely, on walking in a straight line: moving any faster than 'sluggish' would require more willpower than he currently posesses.   A cop car rolls past: thankfully, he doesn't even notice.  Coming to a stop at the primary intersection, Pigboy weasels his way out of the crowd of people waiting for the crosswalk signal to change; swerving towards the olive-drab traffic control box. He pauses to stare blankly at the archeologic strata of stickers and tags: retrieving a cigarette from behind his ear, and lighting it with a quick flash of a bic lighter.  Daisy and Hiro are not in the same place.  Daisy is in a primordial wilderness. Concrete totems rise up around her. The man in front of her is a duck-billed lumbering thing, and she does double-dutch over his swinging tail to avoid it. Needle-nosed pliers twist, warp, and deform in her hand, and eventually disappear entirely if not held in her peripheral vision. She has not dropped them, but their reality is, regardless, uncertain.  Coming from the other direction, she stumbles up to Hiro. Her mouth is simultaneously dry and sticky, and the air tastes like cheap salsa. Her greeting comes out as a torrent of disconnected syllables that tumble over each other in their rush toward fresh air.  "59 6F 75 61 69 69 67 68 74, 44 61 7A 65?" Hiro's lips move soundlessly against the backdrop of urban noise: a dry buzzing serving as audial backdrop to a side-vision scroll of nuclear green HEX. Subjectively.  To the rest of the street, Pigboy drags on his cigarette, uttering a perfunct query as to Daisy's well-being. He looks back over his shoulder with the inquiry, his cigarette's cherry glowing rough textured sandpaper.  The problem, Daisy realizes, is the goddamn goggles, which are covering her eyes. This is keeping her from hearing Hiro correctly. Pushing them up on her forehead, she realizes why she put them down: her pupils are black holes that have completely swallowed her irises.  Wordlessly, she holds the needle-nosed pliers at arm's length. Twisting her wrist gives the pliers enough angular momentum to be noticeable by her still barely-functional peripheral vision. Having confirmed that they still exist, she turns back toward you.  "This is going to fucking kick ass," she claims.  "I think I'm wearing Keene's shoes," Hiro responds, staring down at the black penny-loafers that have supplanted his usual footware. He hits his cigarette again, exhaling in twinned streams from his nostrils. A sharp sniff, and he holds a gloved -- swaddled might be a better term, considering that the only gloves he could find were a size and a half too large -- hand out. "The inshtrumehnt, Mish Moneypennah."  Daisy lowers her goggles. This turns the world a uniform, monochrome shade of green; reduces its complexity; makes it much easier to see. Spinning the pliers around her finger like a gunslinger, she proffers it, tip-first, to Hiro.  "Quickly, boy," she murmurs. "There's not much time."  The bolt on these boxes is a complex affair -- requiring a specific tool engineered for the purpose of opening telco and traffic control switches. Unfortunately, the engineers never foresaw the might of a pair of Stanley stainless steel electrical pliers with ridged polyurethane grip - (c) 2007, patent pending.  Hiro bows his head to accept the pliers two-handed, cigarette dangling from his lip. The pliers fit neatly around the edges of the recessed bolt, twist, and the case pops open with a muffled click. 'Holstering' the pliers in a hip pocket, he bends to unzip his knapsack; back to the crowd, cabinet open just enough for his torso to block.   "Their defenses are no match for our iron crane technique," he drones, cigarette tilting upwards as he inhales: tip again flaring to life.  Pobble stomps along the road, looking a wee bit unhappy at something. His flashy new dress flicking about his legs in the breeze. He drags a cardboard box close behind him - it being attached to his arm by a sturdy peice of string, and apparently supported by a skateboard. Still, its slow going, what with the people and the unweildy nature of the box.  Contrary to her description, Daisy is dressed in a hazard-orange jumpsuit, canary yellow hard hat, electric blue nailpolish, and nuclear green goggles. She calls this a 'disguise'. She presumably hopes to blind anyone who doubts her questionable credentials as a line worker.  She takes up a lookout position. This largely involves her sitting on her toolbox and smoking a cigarette, nervously working her fingernails into the heels of her hands.  A few people walking down the street pause to look at the strange pair, but they are trained by life to avoid strangeness, so they wander by. Luck would have it that Pobble happens to be on the same side of the street as the daring duo. Either their disguises are too elaborate however, or he's too engrossed in personal thoughts to recognize them. The latter is suggested by the stamping of the boots against the sidewalk.  The box wobbles on its wheeled perch, bumping up as it hits uneven ground but settling out once more.  The device -- a patchwork amalgam of electronics -- is lovingly removed from the knapsack, and Hiro sets into fitting alligator clips against contacts: snapping them into place around the metal studs of individual lights' controls. He hits the power test on the timer, the cheap LCD flashing 88:88:88, 00:00:00, 00:15:00; thumbs on the drum-kit to set it to 'breakbeat', then 180 BPM. His cigarette waggles back and forth as he works, ash scattering across the front of his jumpsuit.  Daisy Inscrutable and Pigboy leap into action.  As Hiro wires together his Frankenstein of capacitors and consumer electronics, the young punk girl flips open her case. Two (2) gloves. One (2) cans of spraypaint, red. One (1) portable stereo. The gloves go on her hands. The spraypaint goes in her hands. The stereo, on the other hand, goes in the nearby trash.  There are exactly fifteen minutes of dead air on Hiro's mix tape. Then: street rave.  Flash. 88:88:88. 00:14:59..58..57--  --Hiro fixes the device in place with a strip of jagged, hastily ripped duct tape, taking pause to look back over his shoulder again. No truncheons aimed at his cranium? Good. A glance down at his wristwatch, then up to the flashing LCD display: he synchronizes, then slams the cabinet hastily shut.  "Sound system, Ms. Inscrutable." He loops a hand around the strap of his knapsack, shouldering it, and flashes a V-for-victory high-sign in Pobble's direction.   "We got ten. Let's get a big mac," he invites, eyeing the streetcorner McDonalds.  The bedressed man quirks a brow at the neon street worker. Slowing his walk as if trying to place the fellow. The momentum of the box on wheels behind him causes it to bang into his legs, and he spins about. This makes him yank the string which pulls the box off the cart. Someone says 'Ow.' in a London accent, and with string wrapped about his legs Pobble trips onto the skateboard and finds himself heading into the wall, face first.  "Ow." Is reiterated.  With a single smooth motion, Daisy drops to her knees and slams the junction box closed with her elbows. She swings both arms around in symmetrical arcs, then adds two, slightly more jerky arcs, in the middle. A short, sharp slash follows.  Red spraypaint stains grey sidewalk. It's a symbol everybody understands: a hex nut surrounded by a circle. A slash through the circle.  NO HEX NUTS, it reads, and then Daisy's signature: DI.  Exit, stage McDonalds.          -- Purchase: One Big Mac with cheese.         -- Purchase: One bathroom token.         -- Loss: One hazard-orange jumpsuit, stuffed into the toilet tank.  Hiro is gone for some three to five minutes.  Daisy exeunt.          -- Purchase: two cheeseburger meal.         -- Purchase: one bathroom token (womens).         -- Loss: one hazard-orange jumpsuit, stuffed in the toilet tank.         -- Loss: one pair goggles (expensive). Likewise in the toilet tank.         -- Loss: two cans spraypaint, two gloves. Not in the toilet tank; rather, in the 	trash with the sound system.  Total cost? Fifty-five dollars.  Outside McDonalds, Hiro emerges with a hand-held camcorder; flipping the viewscreen open, and thumbing throught the options menu. "Pobs," he calls, blinking repeatedly in the impromptu drag queen's direction -- he crosses the sidewalk to thump the Brit in the shoulder with a fist, grinning like a lunatic. The Unibomber shades are gone, and his pupils have the rough appearance of twin black holes. "Call us a cab, m'man. We got an appointment - anywhere but here."  Pobble points along the street, "I'm parked just nearby as it goes mate. Was just out dress shopping." He takes hold of the edges of his dress with each hand to show off the fine appareil.  The box must've been nocked by something since it topples back to being right way up. The brit picks it up and places it back on the skateboard. "This way.." he murmers, bringing a hand up to dab at his bloody face.  Following shortly behind is Daisy, who, in the interest of disguising herself as 'not a line worker', has painted her lips anoxic blue, her face death-white, and her eyelids bruise-black. This does not prevent her acne scars from showing through.  "Let's roll, kids," she mutters.  Sure enough, just around the corner is the big huge fat fucking Pobble-hair blue Hummer v2. The transvestite cockney digs some keys out of somewhere and pops the locks ready. It flashes its lights, like a beast awakening from slumber.  Snagging the passenger-side door, Hiro hauls himself up into the industrial-grade hooptie, still fiddling with the camcorder. The door thunks solidly shut, and he looks up; waiting for Daisy and Pobble to clamber on board.  "Park't at the corner, Pobs," he requests. "I wanna get this shit on tape."

       You follow the trail into the trees. Oak Grove  Contents: Cally Paksenarrion Connelly   Cally makes her way over before Pobble enetered and peers over.. "Hello?"  Connelly blinks after cally announces her presence, and seems to reflexivley slip her arm from around Paksen,"Oh...Hello, Cally..."  Paksenarrion sits up a little more, blinking more sleep from her eyes. Her hands reach up and pull her hair into a topknot as she finally reaches a conscious state. "Hello?"  A new arrival's nearness is heard well before it is seen, sounding like someone is dragging something through the woods. It's not immediately obvious what the noise was when Dr Steve steps into the clearing, but once he moves out further its apparent that he has a large cardboard box attached to him by a peice of string and he's dragging it along behind him.  On top of the box is a monkey in a suit, with a cigar. (l pob's Dave) The two seem to be conversing in some strange language.  Pobble says, in Enochian, "Yeah, I would have to agree."   Cally sniffs.. "oh hello Cally? " she tries to look stern. " gee aren't we bubbling over with joy?" trying to smother the grin  Connelly smirks,"Well...you surprised me is all..." She frowns as she sees pobble come in...."Greeeeeeat..." she grumbles quietly....  Paksenarrion lets out a slow breath and stands up in one motion, looking Pobble and the monkey on his box over curiously before she looks to Cally, "Friend?"  Dave stands up, sniffing just a tad and pulling the cigar from his mouth with a tiny little hand. His fingers almost don't reach around the collossal smoke and he comes close to dropping it. He doesn't tho, and taps the dark ash off the side of the box. "Evenin' ladies." he says in his south london monkey-tongue.  Cally turns and waves blinking.. and peers? monkee?  Pobble flashes a plastic over-charmed smile at Connelly, and offers a finger waggle wave to the other two. "Sorry girls, I diddn't mean to interrupt anything. Dave an I were just 'avin a walks."  Connelly sighs,"Hello, sir. Surprise you would even acknowlede me as I am...let me see...what did you call the Irish....I am not good at remembering slurs meant for me..." Her voice is icy as she looks at the doctor, ignoring his monkey...  Cally winces and looks to Paksen her face saying.. "oh no.. not here  Cally slips away to a place where she won't get in the middle Cally has disconnected.  Pobble's face picks up a hint of a smirk but it fades off, and a bland smile condenses onto his lips.  Dave hops forward now that the box has stopped moving and sits on the edge, tapping his giant (relatively) cigar once more. "I would 'ave to suggest that it was probably nothin' nice there luv."  Pobble shrugs, hand absently reaching to the pocket-protector for a cigarette. He goes to say something, and then stops. Like a broken pull cord talking-doll, this happens again. He shrugs.  James arrives from the lake. James has arrived.  Pobble stands at the edge of the clearing, looking.. well, disgruntled may be a good word for it. Next to him is a 4x4x4' cardboard box that is attached to him by a sturdy peice of string. Atop the box, is a monkey. Its a monkey in a suit, with a cigar, hanging off the edge of the box and hitting the side of it with his feet.  Connelly 's sitting near Paksen, giving Pobble an sort of....icy look.....  James walks in to the grove from the direction of the clear lake. He stops next to one of the thirteen trees, and tries to take in what is going on.  Dave laughs at something, shaking its little furry head.  "Lets go Dave. We're not wanted here." says Dr. Steve (Pobble). His false smile remains as he checks the box-cord.  Dave hops up, moving back to the centre of the box and sitting down, holding on tight with one monkey-hand. "How ironic." he says quietly. With that, Pobble turns to head back into the trees, dragging the seemingly not so heavy cardboard box behind him.

      Esther comes wandering up the street, waving her hand in the air and muttering to herself under her breath.  Downtown - Yonge and King(#200RJ)  The most prominent feature of this intersection is the brand-spanking new Bell Canada Enterprises building. It totally dominates the intersection, towering over all other office complexes, its reflective windows sparkling in the daytime sun. Other notable structures include the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Marche restaurant. BCE Place is often used as a setting for TV or movie film crews, its unique, futuristic architectural design perfect for their purposes. The financial core of Toronto can easily be seen from this spot, located to the west. The many business people are once again seen wandering around like drones going to and from their places of work, and to Union Station to the south.  Contents:  Esther  //.etro: It is 2:54 pm, late afternoon, on Wednesday the 10. day of September, 2008.  Working on a late to-go lunch, Penny wrestles with the wrapper of a gyro as she walks. Wrestles because there are other things in her hands. A map. A small book - a phone book? A hat. A backpack. Heading that way, up the block she struggles for balance or at least a happy medium.  Esther read your description.  Esther wanders up to Penny, looking her over and muttering something about satan. She pushes her cart in front of her. She never lets go of her cart. "Hey! Blondie!"    Ester’s Desc:  This woman is dressed in layer upon layer of old, battered clothes. All of them are dirty. Her hair is pulled into a messy ponytail and is greasy and grungy. She looks to be somewhere in her mid to late forties, though it's hard to tell. She has a very haggard look. She seems quite insane. She talks to, or rather argues with, herself most of the day, and pushes a shopping cart filled with various junk that she's picked out of dumpsters.    Carrying:  Cellphone  Penny knows when people shout, they're generally shouting at her. Hey - what's not to notice, right? Mouthful of bread and dubious meat, Penny might've mumbled a 'hey what' toward Esther but for the unfurling map flapping in the breeze. Her communication somewhat diminished, Penny whaps at the paper til it's flat to her body. She squints, swallowing. She knows there's tsatsiki stuck to her face. She knows it and wears it and doesn't care. "Yeah?"  "Got any spare change?" Esther practically yells, holding out a dirty hand. Her eyes twitch as she greedily eyes all of the things Penny's carrying, then looks back up to Penny's face.  Now she's got this look on her face like 'I didn't get enough of this today?' She starts adjusting her things. Maybe it's Esther's lucky day. That bag does look big enough for some serious necessities. She cants her head to the side and gestures up the block with her chin, hand already in her pocket "Loonie if you tell me where I can get decent poutine, hey?" No such thing as a free meal. Penny isn't a something-for-nothing kinda person.  Eyeing the hand in the pocket. "Yeah..." she mumbles, "Poutine... mm hmm." She nods her head furiously, "Down by the ferry. In the terminal." She motions in the direction of the ferry wildly, her other hand still held out to recieve the change.  Penny thumbflicks the loonie like she'd had practice. Like she's unencumbered. As if she's been faking it, some kind of routine, a ruse all along.  It even makes that 'ting' sound. And you get the distinct feeling as she passes along the universal hand-sign for 'hang loose' and heads toward the docks that you've been had. But didn't she give You the money? Strange chick.  You walk south along Yonge to Front.  Downtown - Yonge and Front(#203RJ)  You walk south along Yonge to Queens Quay.  Waterfront - Yonge and Queens Quay(#1102RJ)  You have just received a +recc from Esther.  You walk over to the Ferry Terminal and step inside.  Island Ferries Terminal  You board the old rickety ferry.  You debark off the ferry when it stops at Centre Island.  Centre Island - Proper  You take a small ferry off Centre Island to go to the Island Airport.  Island Airport    And like … an hour later:  Like every Wednesday evening, the bum known as Turtle Jones is hanging out in King Station over at Yonge and King, playing his old beat up guitar. At least, until the cops chase him away yet again he's there...  Island Airport   You paged Turtle Jones with 'Was I supposed to see that?'.  Turtle Jones pages: If you saw it, yes you were.  You paged Turtle Jones with 'It's just .. I'm nowhere near a subway, as far as I can tell.'.  Turtle Jones pages: It's at King and Yonge.  … … …  You take a small ferry back to Centre Island.  Centre Island - Proper    You board the ferry bound for the main land.    You step back onto the ferry terminal as the boat comes to a stop.  You walk back out to the street.  You walk west along Queens Quay to York.  You walk north along Yonge to Front.  You walk north along Yonge to King.  Downtown - Yonge and King(#200RJ)  The most prominent feature of this intersection is the brand-spanking new Bell Canada Enterprises building. It totally dominates the intersection, towering over all other office complexes, its reflective windows sparkling in the daytime sun.

The financial core of Toronto can easily be seen from this spot, located to the west. The many business people are once again seen wandering around like drones going to and from their places of work, and to Union Station to the south.   You enter the King Subway.  Subway - King Station  Dull, cream coloured tiles covers the wall of this station. The linoleum tiled floor stretches out to the yellow plastic warning line where passengers are told not to pass while waiting for a subway train. Subway posters and ads line the walls, framed in metal, protected by a covering of Plexiglas. In the evening, this station is eerily silent and empty. A line of payphones sits on both ends of the north, and south-bound platforms. A separate phone line connects directly with security in case of an emergency. Stairs and escalators lead back up to the street level.  Looking up the stairs, cold rain falls from a grey-black sky without moon or stars. A raw wind blows from the east.  - Type 'ride to  ' to use the subway -  - Check the +map for station names and locations -  Contents: Wednesday Mary Turtle Jones   Jesse arrives from Yonge and King.  Jesse has arrived.  Turtle Jones murmurs that his dinner and wine aren't gonna buy themselves and goes back to playing as the crowd switches once the train leaves and more people come in to catch the next one. He strums the guitar. "My baaaaaaaaby she left me, she left me standin' in the raiiin...." He's got a deep scratchy blues voice and his guitar's seen better days but still works great. "My baby she left me, ain't comin' home again..."  Wednesday keeps her semi-apologetic smile up, though her voice lowers in tone just a bit: "I said I was sorry." She pats her last pat with her jacket, satisfied with how 'dry' the fellow is, whether he is or not. "Don't be rude about being blind," she mutters motioning with her head to the poor bum beside them.  Penny tramps down the stairs, messengerbag slung over her shoulder. She looks up above the payphones. There's usually a clock on the wall there. Fucking country. She looks down at her wrist where there is no watch. Fucking thieves. Left, then right again her glances issue quickly, more like an eyes rolling, disgusted. The girl's as harrassed as a person can get, walking on and on through the station. "Hey," bumps into someone "got the time?"  Wednesday is standing in a cluster of people around the bum, standing very close to a rather boorish business man in a wool over coat.  [OOC] Mary says "Sorry about that. Five year old in the middle of the living room making a sandwich seems to mean a big mess to clean up."  Mary looks up, turning to peer over at Penny, then down at her left watch. "It's 8:12, Miss," she offers.  //.etro: It is 8:13 pm, late evening, on Wednesday the 10. day of September, 2008.  Mary Roberts is what could be termed 'a little slip of a thing'. She's not absurdly short, but she's definately several inches below that of most women her age, reaching only 5'3" in height. Her build is slender and reedy, the sort that a mere breeze could well blow over, and though she doesn't seem unhealthy, it does seem as if she could do with a little more food in her on a regular basis. Her hair is long, reaching to about mid-back, its hue a rich mahogany, likely her best feature, what with the highlights of red sparkling in its tresses. Her eyes are cerulean blue, quite pretty save that there's sometimes circles beneath them, as if she didn't get quite enough sleep. Framed by sooty lashes, the eyes are set in a heart-shaped face, with slightly too-pale skin.. along with lack of food and sleep, it seems perhaps she doesn't get enough sun, though there's enough pink in her cheeks that she doesn't look unhealthy.  A brown shirt covers Mary's torso, trimmed with lace at cuff and collar. The shirt is loose, though its cut is flowing, rather than baggy. The sleeves drape at her wrist, an excess of lace-trimmed material left to hang slightly. The collar is v-cut, dipping perhaps a shade lower than most things Mary wears. At the lowest point of the v, a diamond of lace begins, covering her cleavage, though tiny little bits of skin can be seen through the lace. The shirt ends precisely at her waistline, just short enough that flashes of her belly might be seen, were she to lift her arms much. A white corderoy skirt is worn beneath, much more snug than the shirt, falling all the way to her ankles, with slits cut at either side to allow her to move freely. Wrapped around her waist is a brown suede belt, which is tied shut at her left hip, rather than buckled at her waist, with long tassles of suede hanging to about her knee. A pair of brown leather boots are worn on her feet.    Wednesday is named after Odin in English. In the more Latinate languages, it's Mercury's day - a day for messengers, missives, and arrivals. Fitting, then, that it's on Wednesday that Jesse arrives. The Pig Boy will have another apophenic conniption over this. Stretching his gangly frame and baring a wide yawn, the pale wastrel steps off the train and waits as it pulls away behind him. Stray glances are ignored. Yes, he's in drag. No, he's not your problem. Jesse is merely another eyesore to be forgotten, the details of his appearance lost in the heyday of urban sensory overload.  Rolling his weight forward and letting motion overcome his langor, Jesse drifts away from the tracks, moving gracefully despite the platform heels, and slips through the crowd towards the sunburnt wastrel. Thumb and forefinger splay apart, trace opposite circles. Hang loose.  "Penny!"  Two fingers point left, side by side. 'Got a cigarette?' His posture is tired, he slouches to one side, weight shifting under leather and lycra, one thicksoled boot toeing the stained tiles beneath.  Turtle Jones pluck the guitar a bit more and continues singing his blues song, kicking the hat in front of him for emphasis. "Ain't gonna cry no more over a women that's gonna leeeaaavee... My baby she left me, left me out in the cold, cold rain. My baby she took off and left me all alone again. All alone, baby..."  Wednesday doesn't notice any one in drag, although she would get kick out of it if she happened to notice. Just the same, she is busy flipping the bird behind the back of the asshole business man as he walks away, still fuming.  Once satisfied with her f-off to the upper-middle class, Wednesday drops a crumpled up bill into Turtle's hat.  Turtle Jones read your description.  Wednesday read your description.  Penny says, in Enochian, "Full of grace meets full of woe and the two are oddly matched - one so pale and one so primed. Peace. Got a *********. ********* here, two fingers flat to the button of her pocket. Flicks it open and hands one over. It's ******** she's smiling, Penny is. It is also ******** that she is ********. What is most evident is that her skin does not allow for the full range of emotion to issue forth. That is pain, that is ********** for the ***********. "Where's Eva?" ... she looks past Jesse and it's unclear what she's ******** on; the ********, the guitar-man, the air we breathe. "*********'s wrong," she walks the "drag queen" around the crowd, voice low "for her not to be here before us? I hate this country. Why are we here again?" ********, come to think of it - that's a whine."   [OOC] Jesse doesn't think that worked.  [OOC] Penny says "Not so much, huh?"  [OOC] Mary grins.  [OOC] Wednesday ?'s  Jesse reaches into his purse, and withdraws a cigarette. Sith a grave and solemn mien, the skeletal queen shakes a Lucky Strike free and offers it over, accepting one in return. He leans forwards to plant a kiss on each of Penny's cheeks, murmuring He mutters to Penny. .  He shifts his weight back again, no mean feat on heels like those, and lets his ruby-tinged attention wander over the terminal, boa absently twirling at the lace-gloved ends of spidery fingertips. Watching the teenage flag flown, he rewards Wednesday's efforts with a tilt of his head and a smile, the boa dropped as he snaps at the brim of his hat in salute. His attention crosscuts back to Penny and with a sudden look of urgency, he leans forward once more. "Got a new stencil. JCs posse. Ready to go bombing?"  You sense Jesse reaches into his purse, and withdraws a cigarette. Sith a grave and solemn mien, the skeletal queen shakes a Lucky Strike free and offers it over, accepting one in return. He leans forwards to plant a kiss on each of Penny's cheeks, murmuring "You holding?".  He shifts his weight back again, no mean feat on heels like those, and lets his ruby-tinged attention wander over the terminal, boa absently twirling at the lace-gloved ends of spidery fingertips. Watching the teenage flag flown, he rewards Wednesday's efforts with a tilt of his head and a smile, the boa dropped as he snaps at the brim of his hat in salute. His attention crosscuts back to Penny and with a sudden look of urgency, he leans forward once more. "Got a new stencil. JCs posse. Ready to go bombing?"  [OOC] Jesse says "Hm." [OOC] Jesse says "Apparently, Mutter is also weird. That last bit? That's muttered."  Mary turns her head to the side, and winds up just sort of.. staring at Jesse, with this odd, sort of chagrinned look, like she's torn in equal parts between shock, amusement, and downright appreciation for the Elvis-twin's audacity or bravery.  Wednesday looks up from her precision drop of currency just in time to catch the tail end of Jesse's salute. Rather than being pleased, curiously, she looks momentarily mortified before some semblence of recognition crosses her face and a faint twinkle in her eye gathers.  Turtle Jones spies Jesse and switches to a blues version of an Elvis song. Since he's half blind, he has to squint a bit. "Don't step on my bluuuuuuuuueeeeeee suede shooooooes... no no no..."  Penny coughs politely, really she's choking on something. Laughter. The song. She says, in Enochian, "Of course I am. We should make the monkey do it."   //.etro: Jesse rolls "dexterity + streetwise" at diff 6  For a total of 5 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  "Eva's sulking over something. You think I wanted to take the fucking train? Just don't tell her or I'll be on carnation duty for a month." Elvis follows the sunscorched penitent through the crowds, attracting a good deal less attention than you'd think. People just don't want to be bothered. One arm drapes across Penny's shoulders. The other wanders at his side as they drift, fluid and subtle movements contrasted against the grandiose gestures you'd expect. Trained eyes might catch the quick darting of fingers into and out of pockets that aren't his, or the side pocket of his purse made for surreptitious depositings. But he's very, very good at this. Abruptly, he switches into a foreign language for a few gutteral phrases, then back again. "And tell me we're trading soon. I swear if I get stuck in the heels one more time I'm going to lose it. Why doesn't Pig Boy ever get drag duty?"  Jesse says, in Enochian, "What's the static about? Pig boy and miss *********** did what?"   Wednesday's eyes never leave the form of the drag queen bandit, but has he weaves out through the crowd she has to stand up on turtle's bench just the watch him. She whistles through her teeth, then hops down from the bench, and quietly makes herself into a shadow of Jesse, some 20 meters down the way.  Mary's one of those people that seems to be bothered, for she just keeps on staring, head turning to track Penny and Jesse as they move through the crowd. For a few moments, anyway, before she sighs, shoulders hunching up just a bit. She steps forward and crouches down to drop a bill into the case.. a purple one, with a 10 on it - then straightens, and steps back again, turning away.  Ooo, a what a tip! Too bad Wednesday was looking the other way. Why does such generosity always go unrewarded?  Penny says, in Enochian, "Honestly?" her arm slips around his waist where the skirt starts. They're funny looking, true, but pretty. I think he trades with Inscrutable. I think they do it," emphasis on the do it, "and then he says Would you? and she says Fuck yeah. No different than his homework. And do you really wanna see Piggy in a dress?" Penny looks at Jesse squarely, they're about the same height..or would be if not for those heels making a telephone-pole of him "No. You don't." Her fingers loop something into and out of another pocket, a backup plan maybe, and guides them nearer to the crowd again.  She nods up, should we put something in the hat? "No idea what that's about. Never picked up that kind of crap back in the states. Maybe he pissed off a cop.." Penny shrugs in a way that loosens her jacket everywhere, seems to hang on her now "Anyway I hope she gets over it. I miss her. I'm tired of staying at the Holiday Inn. It's a dump and there's no servicable room service and I'm hurt and I want my own fucking bathroom with my own fucking cabinet and my bed. I want my bed." Seething now, Penny's eyes close and her free hand pushes at something beneath the dreads "And I'm gonna fuck up that monkey for giving me that crap. I woke up *in the fucking desert*."  Turtle Jones has disconnected.  Turtle Jones has connected.  [OOC] Turtle Jones smacks her connection. Sorry.  [OOC] Turtle Jones got locked up a lil bit ago.  [OOC] Wednesday patpats  [OOC] Penny says "Forgiven. You want what you missed? Did you miss anything?"  If Rule 1 is never cop in a dress, the admonition against lifting wallets in drag must have gone unspoken. Which is a shame, seeing as how Jesse could have used the lesson. But, really, who's going to suspect?  He's leaning over Penny, murmuring something in that same strange language, and his attention is drawn on bringing the lit match to the cigarette at his lips. Utterly unmindful of his newfound shadow.  [OOC] Turtle Jones locked up when Penny caughed about the song.  Jesse says, in Enochian, "Heard about the desert. Glad to see you back. Float me some dope and lemme go fix?"   [OOC] Turtle Jones says "er coughed"  [OOC] Jesse can cut and paste a minilog to email?  [OOC] Turtle Jones says "Just a summary would be cool :)"  [OOC] Penny says "Okay well. We're walking and talking and Penny's pissed and Jesse's trying to light his cigarette and now we're near you thinking about putting something into the hat with Wednesday the shadow behind us." [OOC] Jesse picked someone's pocket, Wednesday started following us, we're speaking in a foreign language.  Elvis in drag.  No, really. Not "Wow, he almost looks like ..." or "He reminds me of ..." but "He looks exactly like ..." If Elvis were still twenty, and had spent the last ten years supplementing his Atkins diet with intravenous narcotics. Lean and wiry, the blade of his silhouette cuts a swath somewhere just above the six foot mark without the heels. He might weigh one seventy soaking wet. Sickly and frail, this is a young man in dire need of a hot meal and a good night's sleep. In another time and another place he would have seemed consumptive. Today, the word conjured by his ashen pallor and languid movements is junky.  The drag is neither convincing nor customary - it seems to strive for androgyny instead. A black rhinestone cowboy hat is pulled low over red-lensed Jackie O glasses, obscuring his eyes and casting shadows of doubt over that famous visage. Blue-black hair in a classic bob-cut curls around the angles of his jaw. The carefully sculpted lines of rouge make his cheeks seem sharper, and the ring in the corner of his scarlet painted lips distorts their line into a pale, sullen and anemic sneer.   A black sheer shirt with red lycra accents across the shoulders cocoons his bony form in its synthetic embrace. Over it, a single, blank white pin is a lone decoration on the lapel of a tight waisted riding jacket from Gaultier's line two years back. Beneath it, a black brassiere preserves a modicum of modesty, but displays the swarm of tattoos down the length of his gaunt torso. The riding coat's long cuffs meet a pair of matched spiked bracelets, and black lace gloves.  The red boa circling his throat trails down under the jacket, dangling down to where a black leather miniskirt rides low on his hips, parting from the border of his shirt to show occasional glimpses of fishbelly-pale skin marred by dark swarming ink. A black snakeskin belt, decorated with chrome skulls, is fastened with a faux-ruby crucifix over his left hip, and torn fishnets ride the length of his long legs down to the buckles of a pair of platform, high heeled Prada squaretoed boots. A black rubber baby-sized backpack dangles offhandedly from his shoulder, and a wire trails from its depths to the oversized headphones around his neck.  [OOC] Mary puta 10 in Turtle's case and is turning to leave.  [OOC] Turtle Jones says "Wait, yuo picked someone's pocket?"  [OOC] Turtle Jones says "Hang on, afk a sec"  [OOC] Jesse hangs on.  Wednesday taps her umbrella playfully with the tips of her shoes as she strolls down along the walkway. Its all so wonderfully nonchalant that she even catches the smile of some annonymous, flirtations busy-body on his way to a train. She returns it just in brief and continues.  [OOC] Penny says "He rolled for it. 5 successes."  Penny says, in Enochian, "Check your left breast pocket." She's a clever girl. Put it there pedant la bise."   [OOC] Turtle Jones says "Okay, sorry, my boss called me afk to help him."  A gust from an oncoming train interrupts the match Jesse's trying to get at. And really, Penny should be doing that anyway. That's her job today, providing for the arrivals. She pulls out a ridiculous looking lighter - something zippo might make if there were a universal market for the little bit of Liberace in everyone - its rhinestones sparkle and the flame stays put in three single blue lines. "I don't even think they're here, to tell you the truth. Why hide, right?"  [OOC] Turtle Jones is in backscroll from when she was afk. Jesse, what's with all the dex+streetwise rolls?  [OOC] Turtle Jones says "....What does streetwise have to do with it?"  [OOC] Wednesday remembers in 2 Ed. streetwise covered such dirty street deeds as pickpocketing.  [OOC] Wednesday says "or at least I think."  [OOC] Jesse shrugs. It seemed appropriate, nobody objected. [OOC] Jesse says "If it's a problem, we can drop the whole "Jesse picked a pocket" thing and just carry on." [OOC] Wednesday says "although, I like wear that leads me."  [OOC] Turtle Jones is sorry she's a bit out of it. She got locked up and had to relog in and then being afk... Okay uhm, as far as what I've always known, Streetwise meant what was going in in black markets, underground, etc. ON the streets. Not an ability used for crime. [OOC] Jesse nods. 'tever. We'll set something else up. So, then, Jesse did not pick a pocket. He merely swapped cigarettes and went to the bathroom.  [OOC] Mary thought there was an actual pickpocketing skill. Or.. am I on crack again? [OOC] Wednesday says "it /is/ a talent. Pickpocketing is a secondary, which, means it can technically be covered under a primary. but its up to the good ol' staffer."  [OOC] Penny says "Right."  [OOC] Mary whews. Ok. Not on crack.  Ever wonder? Now you know. Between banks of pay phones stand two doors, labelled clearly. Jesse walks past the XX door, and pushes open the XY. Thankfully it's not rush hour.  Time passes. It's taking a while.  Jesse re-emerges from the bathroom, unsteady on his heels. His arm, again, finds purchase across Penny's shoulders, but now a bit more support seems to be asked of them, as the lanky caricature drapes in place beside her. A fresh cigarette, unlit, dangles from the smudged lines of his lips.  "Boring, Sidney, boring. Fuck this place. Let's go find trouble."  [OOC] Turtle Jones says "Okay, just an FYI... I'm going to be banning pickpocketing NPCs unless a staff person judges it. In fact, all pickpocketings need to be rolled out, but not judged between two PCs unless you feel it necessary. You shouldn't need a judge for every little thing, after all. This is just because of the high high level of petty crime like pickpocketing that is going on and the cops busting down on it."  [OOC] Turtle Jones says "Just an FYI heads up for you guys."  [OOC] Wednesday nods and will play nice. :)  [OOC] Jesse says "Appreciate the help."  [OOC] Mary says "Gotcha."  "Oooooooh you ain't... you ain't nothing but a hound dog." dum dum dum dum. Turtle Jones seems to stick to one main chord through most of his songs. "No baby, you ain't. Noooooothing. Nothing but a hound dog." He kicks the hat with his foot lightly. "Please give freely, my friends. This is, as they say, the last call."  The long bathroom break -- Wednesday occupies her time with a snack vendor, musing over the nutty-butty bars and kit kats, until Jesse emerges and she decides on...oh, lets say Skittles  .  Mary, having just deposited her 10 in the hat, backs up, turns, and starts heading out at a trot, heading for the street level.. she's dawdled here long enough, after all. Up she goes.. and out.  Mary walks up the flight of stairs back to street level.  Mary has left.  Turtle Jones plays a flourish on the guitar and then pats it lovingly. "Good girl, Bessy. Let's see what we got ourselves." He bends to get the hat.  In the meantime, Penny's flicked a loonie into the busker's hat. Loonie. Who calls their money crazy? Canadians. Good thing she kept the lighter out. Flick, nudging Jesse reminding him this is the part where you're supposed to inhale.  Penny says, in Enochian, "Boring, boring." Heaving his weight so that he might carry himself better, Penny shifts under Jesse's arm and starts out on the right foot. "Yeah, come on. Read my future for me.""   Jesse puffs listlessly at the cigarette, dragging his feet towards the stairs. He says, in Enochian, "Fuck the future." Spoken around his cigarette, its end dancing as he speaks. He says, in Enochian, "Noisy fucking nosy shit, it is." He reaches one hand up to plant it squarely atop his hat, ensuring the rhinestone-studded stetson will not be lost in his ascent. He says, in Enochian, "...here to break everything, and ruin their lives."   You walk up the flight of stairs back to street level.  Downtown - Yonge and King(#200RJ)  The most prominent feature of this intersection is the brand-spanking new Bell Canada Enterprises building. It totally dominates the intersection, towering over all other office complexes, its reflective windows sparkling in the daytime sun. Other notable structures include the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Marche restaurant. BCE Place is often used as a setting for TV or movie film crews, its unique, futuristic architectural design perfect for their purposes. The financial core of Toronto can easily be seen from this spot, located to the west. The many business people are once again seen wandering around like drones going to and from their places of work, and to Union Station to the south.  Jesse arrives from the King station stairwell.  Jesse has arrived.  From afar, Jesse's purse may be snatched. Hang on.  You paged Jesse with 'Ngg.’  Jesse pages: No, Wednesday - I just picked the pocket to hook her into RP, but since it got retconned, she may not rob me.  Long distance to Jesse: Penny laughs, "Can people rob us?"  You have just received a +recc from Portia.  Wednesday arrives from the King station stairwell.  Wednesday has arrived.  Jesse pages: Purse is being snatched on the stairs. Brace for it.  You paged Jesse with 'Should I roll something to kick her ass or what..'.  From afar, Jesse dunnos, let's see what she does.  Jesse and Penny are making their slow way up the stairs.   Slow. Real slow. Misanthropically slow. They are spending near to an eternity getting up the stairs. Right, left. Right, left.   Mesozoically slow.    Wednesday slips on her coat and draws a long breath and shakes off a few jitters. She readies her weapons of choice: the umbrella and the bag of skittles she just bought from the vender in one hand and free's the other. She lurches into a trot, then a jog, then *BAM!* The nab, her hand aimed and coiled around the strap she takes off up the stairs.  [OOC] Wednesday says "oh shush"  _______________________ //.etro: Toronto by Night ____________________  Streetwise   _______________________________________________________________________  Wednesday:  A runaway  She can pickpockets pretty well  She knows a fence who buys stolen credit cards and other items  _______________________________________________________________________  [OOC] Wednesday P  Penny could let Jesse teeter and fall but she takes a breath to steady him. Yes, that's how well they know eachother - they can compensate for eachother better than scales. Then takes off up the stairs after the kid. Doesn't bother yelling, it'd only confuse other people and the goal is to nab just the one.  Killjoy. Jesse's head slams into the steps, blood exploding from his nostrils. Ruin a perfectly good high, why doncha? As Penny departs already in motion, Jesse regains his footing in a crouch, all liquid muscle and seething tendons now, as he straightens himself and quite deliberately continues to climb. Now, he's moving of his own accord, with painstakingly controlled tension convulsing through his limbs. One trembling hand drift along the banister, the other has retrieved his blood-flecked cigarette from the stair and is occupied with bringing it to and from his twisted mouth. The blood, flowing freely from his nose, is left unchecked; twin streams of it divide at his lips and draw a horrible fu manchu against the pallid white of his ashen skin.  He continues, then, to climb.    Though she is of a light complexion, almost alabaster, there's a glow to this girl's face, be it in a jubilant expression or lost in more quiet concerns, or some shine of her hair or eye, that dispells the general pallor of her skin and keeps it from appearing sickly--most of the time at least. Her eyebrows are thin and finely rounded in curves that beframe her shapely, gold-speckled eyes. So too, her cheeks and brow and whisp of chin seem expressed as simple but elegant accessories. If only she would sleep off those bags beneath her eyes, those unsightly dark circles she might completely pull of that look of naive youth. Unfortunately, she comes off looking strangely distant, weary. Her hair is a dark auburn, almost black. It is swooping but falls straight, twisting in careful locks around her shoulders. Somehow, her hair puts unnecessary accent on the very thinness of her neck, colar, wrists, waist, hips and all, making her look a bit too thin--much too thin at times.  Today, Wednesday is dressed in comfortable, practical attire. She wears a pair of black linen trousers. They are rolled at the cuffs where the material touches the fake leather of her canvas tennis shoes. She wears, also, a long sleeve shirt of a cheery pastel color, a tweed bracelet, and a three silvery chains about her neck.  Wednesday is unnerved by the fact that no one even bothered to yell. Idiots--people who haven't been through this, yell. These people *didn't* yell. Fuck. On the first and only level break between steps, Wednesday lifts the bag of skittles up into the air--why not?--and RIPS it wide open. Those Little round -slippery- buggers fly out everywhere, scatter on the tile..  Penny says, in Enochian, "Fucking STAY there." Doesn't need to look, has eyes in the back of her head. Dead serious, scary serious. She's got twice the leg this kid Wednesday does and knows how to use every inch to get the jump on her.  Oh and skittles aren't exactly hard to walk on. They *squish* just like chewing gum when you *step* on them in big, flat-soled boots - as is evident on every city block in every country everywhere in the world.  The sunburnt blonde is coming to get you.  Why couldn't you get the GOBSTOPPERS, Wednesday?! Make a mental note, girl. Next time, next time. For now, just RUN. That woman didn't look like the donut eating-type. Run run run! Wednesday makes it to the top of the stairs, running past startled on-lookers who can't put it all together fast enough.  It is possible to run in heels. With practice, you can do it. It's rarely pretty. Jesse is not practiced, and so opts for the elegant solution of the stroll. Penny is chasing. Jesse is in slow and careful pursuit. Skittles crunch under the flat soles of his platform boots. The blood is now smeared, a ghastly sticky kool aid smile and an eerie patch of wet on the boa. God forbid you stained the jacket. Passerby freeze for a moment at the sight of him, and he is not above taking advantage of the situation. A samsonite briefcase is commandeered, and the wraithly form pivots in place, discus-style.  "Penny. Down."  He lashes out with all the gangly length of his arm, making an atlatl of his elbow as he sends the luggage flying up at the dissapearing thief.   [OOC] Jesse isn't sure what to roll, here.  [OOC] Wednesday says "I'd say dex + athletics?"  [OOC] Wednesday says "unless you have some Throw in there."  [OOC] Jesse says "vs?"  [OOC] Wednesday says "ah...goood question. I can't see you throw it so at least there's no dodge, but she is running at top speed away from you. 7 or 8?"  //.etro: Jesse rolls "dexterity + athletics" at diff 8  For a total of 0 success(es). [OOC] Jesse says "Curses."  [OOC] Wednesday says "phews! :)"  [OOC] Wednesday says "comes down to Penny and Wendy then."  Ryo arrives from the south.  Ryo has arrived.  Ryo comes strolling along, his walking stick occasionally taps the ground with the soft sound of wood on cement.  From out of the subway stairway, Wednesday is running at TOP speed away from Penny. She's carrying a purse in arm and a briefcase is flying past her.  [OOC] Ryo says "as if the case was thrown?"  [OOC] Jesse nods  [OOC] Wednesday nods, "Yup."  [OOC] Wednesday says "thrown from behind her."  Penny dodges right but doesn't slow down. Lips pressed into a tight line, people can hear her muttering in that other language. God and Jesse only know what it is she's saying. Penny is making her presence felt on all sides and people are getting out of her way.  Here she comes, Wednesday. All hot for you.  Penny's arms are stretched out, Penny's arms are longer than the law. Her hands get a hold on the thief's shirt-collar and necklaces.  And she yanks.   Ryo moves pretty damned fast for an old guy. He takes it upon himself to see what the heck is going on as he sprints towards the duo, stick in hand.  Jesse is a bloody mess.  A six foot pole-skinny drag queen who looks like Elvis, pale as death and twice as angry. He climbs the stairs slowly, seething and coiled, blood issuing from his nose and smeared across the pallid reaches of his mouth and chin.  Wednesday *gasps* as she's suddenly choked on the force of her own momentum and brutal pull of the other woman. Her feet kick out from under her, fly up into the air, and send her dropping straight onto her back. This knocks the /rest/ of the air out of the poor girl. Scramble or breath? She doesn't have much time to make the decision. She chooses to breath, sucking back air in a terrible 'huuuuuh' sound.  Ryo pulls out his cell phone even as he slows to s stop not more than maybe twelve feet from the rukus. One hand remains on his walking stick as the other punches three numbers. *beep* *beep* *beep* He stops with his finger poised over the 'send' button,"What is going on here?!"  Arriving beside Ryo, Jesse waves the end of his boa (the end not soaked in his own blood and mucus). "Street Theater." He holds out a hand. "Donate to Artists against Fascist Modernity, sir?"  Penny whistles through her teeth. Not nearly as terrible as it's going to be. Penny didn't even break a sweat. She adjusts her grip, dragging the necklaces and shirt into a tight fist on top of Wednesday, straddling the girl. She says, in Enochian, "Take care of that, hey Jes?" nodding toward the old man with the cane. The blonde begins to kneel down, right knee to the pavement, left boot lurching upwards into the girl's armpit. She gets low, nose to nose with her and hisses She says, in Enochian, "My name is Penny Ante. And you do not steal from me. Ever."   Of course its, useless in these sort of unlikely situations, but instinct drives Wednesday's foot toward Penny's crotch before the leg is subdued. Predictable results. Wednesday doesn't respond to whatever language is spoken, she just tries to lift her body up with all her might--which isn't a whole lot.  "English, Penn." Jesse licks his bloody fingers. "Corn syrup and red number five." He offers them over to Ryo, for a taste. "Sure you wouldn't like to donate? Or help out? We're staging something next month that I think you'd be perfect for." The other hand reaches out, prods the older man's bicep, gently. "Mmm. Perfect. Quite."   Wednesday says, "HELP!" Wednesday screams at Ryo."  "HELP!" Wednesday screams at Ryo.   Ryo doesn't pause any longer. His thumb twitches *beep* 'send',"I'm calling the police to get this settled." he says as he backs out of Jesse's reach.   Jesse says, in Enochian, "Rig's in the bag. Ditch ******** you have."    Penny looks up at Ryo and winks, distinctly at him. That kind of look from that kind of woman? should be enough to convince any man she a) wants him or b) wants his approval ..however brief it may be. But her attention returns to Wednesday's writhing "Good, good. That'll do."  Jesse says, "Let her go, Penny. The police will be here, soon." He shrugs, and uses the end of his boa to wipe at the blood on his face, adjusts his sunglasses, and replaces his hat atop his head. "Whoever she stole the bag from, I'm sure she'll come forward."   [OOC] Ryo says "having trouble getting a staffer to play a copl"  [OOC] Jesse nods. I'm having a bad staff karma day.   Ryo motions the stick to indicate Jesse and Penny,"You two are staying here."   She hisses again, menace murdering her english into a subdued whisper "My name is Penny Ante. And you do not steal from me. Ever. Understand?" She waits another moment. "Nod if you understand and I'll let you go."  Jesse blinks, letting his glasses slide down the length of his nose so he can stare, with blood shot eyes, over them and at the old man. "Excuse me?"  She fights still, but at Jesse's word's, Wednesday slumps. She lets a moment pass in spite before she nods slowly at Penny. She can't look her in the eye.   Ryo picks up his cellular phone and begins to dial.  Ryo says, "That's right, you two aren't going anywhere."  Ryo says, "not till the police can get this figured out."   [OOC] Jesse'd like staff at this point.  [OOC] Ryo says "I'm actually calling miranda on my cell."  [OOC] Ryo says "or are you talking tms?"  [OOC] Jesse isn't sure, I'd just like to speak to the staffer involved.  [OOC] Jesse says "Miranda's doing it?"  [OOC] Ryo says "yeah..talk to miranada."  [OOC] Ryo says "afk for like 3mins."   And like that, the rehearsal is over.  Penny lifts herself up from that crouch with particular attention to two things - Wednesday's downcast eyes and the bag, the latter she picks up and collects as something familiar to her; as someone that owns, protects and keeps. "Thank you," her smile a sliver, her words uttered like instructions. Exeunt.   [OOC] Jesse says "What?"  //.etro: It is 11:30 pm, late night, on Wednesday the 10. day of September, 2008.  [OOC] Jesse says "Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but what the hell is with people interrupting RP, saying "Hang On," and going OOC? This is my first scene IC, and that's twice it's happened."  [OOC] Penny says "I dunno man. I definitely don't get it."  [OOC] Wednesday shrugs, "it happens. RL has a way of breaking into RP. My first scene IC too, by the way."  [OOC] Ryo says "back"  Wednesday is slow to get up. She nurses her injury--some dull pain along her back--as she gets to her feet. Her eyes dart between Penny, Ryo, and Jesse, not sure how to play the scene, wondering if she should run or not. The tension in her muscles show her confusion.  (Directed into the phone) Ryo says "yes."  Devard arrives from the east.  Devard has arrived.  Jesse says, in Enochian, "Chir Iki Tik lesser ******** of ************** and ********* to the loa of the new city ward that phone from its ********?"   Daisy arrives from the south.  Daisy has arrived.   Jesse, blood smeared across his mouth and chin from a bloody nose, is glaring at Ryo and speaking in the language in which he and Penny have been communicating.   Wednesday is just getting up from the ground, clothes a little tossed and scuffed. She stands, not entirely confidently, near Penny.  Ryo glares at Wednesday as her muscles tense for a possible run. His voice is menacing,"Don't move."   Daisy is late.  This is a statement of general fact rather than of current circumstances. Daisy is late to work, late to class, late to bloom, late to bed and, likewise, late to rise. She is, apparently, here to pick someone up, but is rather late to that as well.  About a block south of here, travelling at a bouncing jog, she's coming up the street, looking frantically about for something or another.   Devard is bored. This, too, is a general state of affairs, as he meanders up from the west. However, what he sees ahead of him loos downright Fun! Let's go watch, Shall we? A.. predatory grin, and he alters course for the incipient fight.   Wednesday locks eyes with Ryo. Some desperation begins to seep out from behind her demeanor. She swallows, looks to Jesse for any kind of cue.   Jesse shrugs at Ryo and turns his back on the man, walking over to offer Wednesday a hand up. "I hate this script. We need a better ending."   Penny says, in Enochian, "DAZE" Her voice authoratative and welcoming. That person there belongs here. Those movements, these seconds come apart as Penny catches sight of Daisy and positions herself as one set downstage. "You get all that on tape? I think we need to rework some blocking here.."   Devard has reconnected.  Devard has partially disconnected.   It's not difficult to find the people she's looking for: they are, as usual, clustered in a loose bunch and looking for trouble. Pulling up beside them, she gestures.   Wave hello. Hang loose. Want a cigarette?   Devard has reconnected.  Devard has partially disconnected.  Devard has reconnected.  Devard has partially disconnected.  Devard has reconnected.  Devard has partially disconnected.  Devard has reconnected.  Devard has partially disconnected.  Devard has reconnected.  Devard has partially disconnected.  Devard has reconnected.  [OOC] Devard snarls.  Devard has partially disconnected.   A smile breaches Wednesday's face like sudden light through a cracked door. She nods quickly, disjointedly. "Yeah. A happy one." Her laugh curls up.   He pulls Wednesday to her feet, nods, then lights a cigarette and turns to grin at the raver who has turned up. "Oi, Daze." Peace. Got a cigarette? His hand moves through the greeting gesture by rote, absently. "How'd it look? You think the blood's real enough?" Jesse plucks the cigarette from his lips and offers it to her.   Ryo can't seem to get a signal on his phone, but narrows his gaze at Jesse and Penny,"Be on your way will-workers." he says, no sign of fear in his voice.  Devard quirks a brow at Ryo's words. "Ahem." he says, as he stops nearby. "Perhhaps I can be of some assistance in Mediation?"   Wednesday straightens up her back, stands proud, waves her hands like the winding of a toy dancer. At Ryo's words, and the lowering of his phone, she begins to make a bee-line to...well, anywhere that *isn't* here. She smiles politely at Ryo as she passes, and tries only a moment's sheepish glance back at Penny.   Penny says, in Enochian, "Stupid fucking kids." Penny mimes Jesse's wave and relights the cigarette for Daisy; went out after too much mashing and fake-blood got in the way. "You're late, too." She looks at the girl as if to say What's the story, mornin'glory? "I got here just in time.""   Miranda arrives from the north.  Miranda has arrived.  [OOC] Miranda says "Just ignore me...watching the scene as a storyteller type."  Jesse is, at this point, ignoring Ryo. He leans in to plant a bloody peck on Daisy's cheek. "Inscrutable." Straightens. Stretches. Adjusts his hat. "What in god's name are we doing here? It's freezing. Penny. English, please."  "Looked great," Daisy says confidently. "Shit. Now where's she going?"  One hand darts to her pocket, pulls a cigarette, offers it to Jesse. Her expression is fixed into straight-arrow neutrality, though her forehead is wrinkled into nestred chevrons of worry.  A beat passes, and she adds, "and who the fuck is the jap?"  Ryo gives chase to the fleeing woman. Maybe he wants some answers.  Wednesday just...walks. Footsteps. Is that some one coming up behind her? Keep walking. Keep walking. She doesn't turn to face Ryo until he's right up next to her. She looks up.  Jesse shrugs languidly, gesturing with the cigarette taken from Daisy. "Him? Dunno. Just some whatever. Didn't like the scene, I don't think." He calls over. "Sir? Was it the dialogue or the acting?" A blink, a frown. "Sir? Pleased not to be harassment of the actrissings. Expressley verbotened by the mnngt."  Compton arrives from the south.  Compton has arrived.  Devard blinks. He's being ignored! Sheesh. You walk up to a fight, offer to help them cool it.. and they run away. Figures. So, he just stands there, watching. Hey, He's a totally innocent bystander!  Yeah, the old man with the cane, running. After a kid. That's funny. Really - should get that on tape, too. Penny hasn't even checked the contents of the bag yet. "Sorry. Right - it's fucking freezing. Let's find a diner? Do they have diners in this country?"  Compton plods along the west side of hte street, his hand shoved deeply in to this pockets and his head hung low. A grimice planted on his face.  Jesse is pointing, when Compton arrives, at the departing form of Wednesday, trying to skulk, and at the Nipponese gentleman chasing her. "Fuck Diners. What bar have we colonized?"  You have just received a +recc from Ryo.  Alyx has arrived.  Wednesday walks east along King to Church.  Wednesday has left. [OOC] Alyx lets curiosity get the better of her. So, rar.  Ryo walks east along King to Church.  Ryo has left.  [OOC] Devard cackles.  Wednesday pages: Well that was fun. :) See you around town.  You paged Wednesday with '-Yes- it was. Look forward to it :)'.  "Fuck bars," Daisy responds casually, her carefully practiced neturality swinging upward into a half-grin. "Fuck bars entirely. You got to see this video me and Hiro made. Better than the Real World. Better than Iron Chef. Better than anything."  With her free hand, she shoves back a few lank strands of black hair.  "Except maybe that thing you did in Nevada with following Good Master Thompson," she amends. "Dju you ever get that car out of the ravine?"  Comptonstomps up to Jesse and Penny, and drags a hand from his pants and check a digital watch and scowles at it, "Jesus, what you guys doing? Been waiting for 40 minutes." he states clearly, scoweling at the lot.  She just has to turn around. Jesse's pointing "Hey what'd that guy say to you anyway?" And oh lord, things are getting interesting. "Old fuckin'man." Penny can't grin but she can whistle at Compton just to make him feel funny. "Where the hell have you people been?" ... wait, that might explain it .. "You were at the wrong station. Weren't you. This isn't like the Bart, C."  Alyx read your description.   Pause. More blinking. He Just.. Grins at Daisy, not really caring if she's looking his way or not. "Hey, How's hiro doing? You two get your laundry done?" Devard calls out. yes, He's butting in. He /said /he was bored. "I've got some stuff that might interest the pair of you.."  "Pobs said Union" the old guy (Compton) gruffs.  Compton jerks his thumb back over his shoulder, south-like, "Fucking Hummers 4 blocks down>" he says, "Didn't want to have to move it again."   Someone else comes a-strolling down the street, chatting quietly on her cellphone. That someone, however, rings off when she spies a group of quasi-familiar people down the way, tucking aforementioned technology into her bag and shrugging that back onto her shoulder.  Alyx lifts a hand in mute wave towards Daisy and Hiro, apparently unconcerned that it's the dead of night, and she's out walking on her own.  [OOC] Daisy says "Compton, not Hiro. :) Yes, I know Daisy and Hiro are always together. Unfortunately, he's not here right now."  You say, "When isn't Pobs on something, old man.." she hugs him even as she chastizes him. "Really. Are we situated yet? Or are we all staying at the Holiday Inn without knowing it..""  [OOC] Alyx says "Comp. I am so conused. Him. :>"  [OOC] Alyx says "Old guy. :>"  "Pobs," Daisy says, gesturing with the tip of her cigarette toward Compton, "is a git. An utter git. If I trusted him, I'd be waiting on Union with my thumb up my ass."  [OOC] Jesse, drag queen, elvis. Daisy, raver. Penny, sunburned, hippy.  [OOC] Alyx says "I swear, the cat drags in something new every day 0:)"  [OOC] Penny says "Eat me, not a hippy."  [OOC] Daisy says "Call me a raver IC, and you get the shiv, Jesse."   Compton patpats Penny on the back, looking like an Uncle afraid of getting caught on camera with his neice, "Rose Motel's cheaper" he replys.  Jesse says, in Enochian, "Nip had a weird *********. Astrals all freaky and glowy. left trails and shit. Lets keep an eye on him."   [OOC] Devard,Bored magician. Don't forget /that/. :p  Jesse pulls his attention back from the east, and shrugs, letting his rose colored attention pan across the motley cast as his pale, blood-smeared face twists into a crooked grin. "Who's sorted?"  Penny seethes, spits "I *trusted* that fucking *monkey* and look what it got me." She's talking about her sunburn and the dreads. "I'm going to spit Dave, roast him and eat him. While Pobble watches."  Upon getting close enough, Alyx interjects mildly, "Maybe without Dave, I could actually get some sense out of Dr Steve." A bright, almost saccharine smile is offered towards Epnny and Jesse, before she asides to Daisy, "S'up?"  Jesse has/had a bloody nose, y'see. And it smeared all over. Look sort of ghastly, I do.  Well. Devard wouldn't say that. Best not to Inquire. Yay! /another /familiar face. "What, Alyx? You know /another/ Dave?" he grins, taking a few steps towards her. "No rose at the moment, Alas. Friends of yours?"  Jesse slaps his wrist, suddenly, where his watch is under his coat, and looks around intently.  "I get the first bite, on account of Dave keeps trying to touch me while I'm asleep," Daisy mumbles, taking a deep, aggrieved drag on her cigarette. This is not the only complaint; there are several more, but they're muffled into incoherence by the presence of her filter. "We've arrived. All of us now; all seven, except for the one we can't mention. This is Kid Sinister, whose name is that because he's sinister as fuck, and this is Penny Delightful, whose name is that on account of she's wholly delightful and cheery as the noonday sun and, no, not at all bitter."  Jesse, wrapping his boa around his neck, tucks one platformed foot behind the other and bows his rhinestoned head in a parodic curtsy when his name is called, skeletal arms splaying out to either side as his knees bend with the gesture.  To say that Alyx jumps slightly at Devard's comment woulden't be entirely true....she's startled, though lazily so. Jumping would take far too much effort. "Ah...yeah," she murmurs, then mock-frowns at   Devard. "No rose? Not good enough, David!" She shakes her head bemusedly, looking forward once more at Daisy's comment, one brow raising slightly.  Sacha arrives from the north.  Sacha has arrived.  Penny steps back a bit from the swarm to marvel at chaos springing eternal and stare daggers into Daisy's stone(r)cold heart "It's Penny Ante," she reaches behind her head, fingering something that makes her wince .. wince more than Jesse's curtsy and looks at Devard "You're Dave. We have to call you something else. The monkey is Dave and you shouldn't have to live with that."  "Alyx, this is Compton, Compton, this is Alyx, Jesse, this is Alyx, Penny, this is Alyx, Alyx, this is Penny, Alyx, this is Jesse, Jesse, this is Compton, Compton, this is Jesse, Jesse, this is Penny, Penny, this is Compton," Daisy says in chipmunkish sequence, outlining every possible permutation of introduction available. "And you are too delightful, Penny, Penny-my-pet; too delightful for words or, uh, even to be particularly nice to me even though you ain't seen me for like for-fuckin'-ever."  She does not introduce Devard. She, in fact, avoids looking at Devard directly, and winces visibly when he is introduced.  "Penny?" Jesse leans in, tilts his head, mutters something, as he looks at the crowd.  Jesse mutters to Penny, "... a bathroom... I... fix again."  Jesse mutters "There a bathroom near here? I want to fix again."  Sacha is walking down the street, crowded tonight. He coughs and takes another drag of his ciggarette. Keeps walking. Not like he know's anyone here. Not really. Just some big tattooed guy walking at night.   Alyx sketches an exaggerated bow as she's introduced - repeatedly - and grins loosely. "Yeah. Don't really need to say any more," she observes, shaking her head a little. Turning, she beckons Devard down a little (she's only short, remember), presumably to murmur something to him, quiet-like.  Penny cants her entire self backward against Jesse and hmns and nods and looks around.  Devard thought that might happen. His grin grows. "Im' sorry, Alyx.. My dinner date ran off with it." he chuckles. "Hmm. Magnofico?" he suggsets to Penny, grinning. Looks back to Daisy. "How's Hiro doing?" he leans over to listen to Alyx.. still grinning.   Penny mutters to Jesse.  You whisper "Yeah, c'mon I'll take you." to Jesse.  Alyx mutters to Devard, "... of... to... Would... down... the... grab... fetch... things?"   Penny pushes off Jesse with a '1 sec' gesture, grabs Daisy because she can and hugs her because she should, leaning down on her head "Gimme a break, it's that fucking monkey's fault. You can show me the thing and I'll buy. All night."   Alyx imparts whatever dire and important information she needs to, before grinning impishly at the taller man and turning back towards the cluster of freaks, watching antics bemusedly.     It's almost .. no, it's exactly like a family reunion. Only it's happy. And there's no drunk uncle pinching asses. Yet.   Devard blinks, quirks a brow, then eans forward to whisper something /back/ to Alyx.  my, this is a conspiratorial group, Neh?  Devard mutters to Alyx, "... your..."  Sacha walks past the cluster, boots a noticible sound as he moves past, his eyes travel over the people, recognizing one letting them linger on Alyx a moment as he moves on by.  +recc for Wednesday sent.  Never losing her smile, Alyx remarks something in return to Devard, hands gesturing vaguely before her arms cross.  Alyx mutters to Devard, "... it is. Now go...."  Compton seems to have zones out in the distance. Then he's back, blinking a few times and looking around annoyed, '...fucking hell...' he mumbles to himself.   Miranda goes home.  Miranda has left.  You have just received a +recc from Wednesday. [OOC] Daisy says "Ur. One second."  Compton sighs and looks, back the way he came, "We goin or not kids?" he asks with all the patience of a underslept grizzley. "The 'Pots' just two blocks away..." he offers up as a solution.  Jesse reemerges from a nearby convenience store, his face washed, his makeup fixed, his complexion death-pale and ashen. With langid and sluggish coservatism of motion, he drapes himself again on Penny's shoulder, and begins to navigate his way back to the riot in waiting, said navigation made difficult on account of his giant platform heels.  A lucky strike, left between his lips, is pursued by a disposable lighter whose flame vaccilates and weaves, unsteady and for a long time unsuccessful in its efforts to engage the cigarette in meaningful dialogue on the topic of fire. Sighing visibly as that trial ends in a victory for the forces of chemistry, Jesse sags once more, slumping in place, his long, lethargic frame curling in on itself.  "Pleasedta, Alex." He turns to Daisy, tilts his head to one side, mumbles something gutteral.  Jesse says, in Enochian, "who is she?"   Devard grins some more. "Spoilsport." he sighs, and turns to walk back west. "Very well. But only because you asked so nicely."  Alyx smiles brightly towards Devard, hands clasping absently behind her back for a moment, before one slips forward to her hip to toy with the ribbons dangling there.  At first glance, Alyx seems to be somewhere between adulthood and adolescence. She's a small woman, reaching to a mere 5'2", her frame diminuitive and given to willowy limbs, leaving her with the appearance of a gangly teen, at times. Only when one looks to her pale, heart-shaped face, do the less-obvious signs of age come into play. Fine laughter lines about her eyes and a somewhat cynical quirk to her lips all hint at her being somewhat older than teenage, perhaps even so far as into her early thirties. Her black hair, cropped short in a somewhat pixieish manner, frames her face nicely, setting off the startling green of her eyes. These are often partly obscured by a pair of wire-rimmed reading glasses.   She's clad in a skirt and blouse, both of cotton. The blouse is plain and white, no frills or ruffles though the sleeves billow slightly before drawing in at the wrist. A single pocket sits over the left chest-pannel, embroidered with a small gold sun. The skirt is similarly plain in cut, black and straight, a narrow triangle cut from by her left ankle up to just above that knee, revealing a red silk underlayer. The shirt is tucked into this, revealing the real color to her outfit. A two-inch wide belt woven from narrow strips of brightly colored ribbon circles her waist, sporting hues like sunset pink, spring green, lemon yellow and many others. Tied loosely at the side, the ribbons have been unwound to hang down along her left leg, fluttering with each movement. Her feet are protected by inch-high platformed sandels, revealing toes decorated with two silver rings and gold-painted nails.    Carrying:  Cellphone  The man before you stands maybe 5'8", dark brown eyes, in sharp contrast to his pale white skin, flickering around, trying to take everything in. Of about average build, he still manages to come across as skinny: his skin, though, despite it's paleness, shows signs of weathering, suggesting he's been outdoors a lot. THis idea is further reinforced by his clothing.. His footwear, at least: Sturdy blue jeans are tucked into stout brown walking boots, and a simple white shirt that has seen better days covers his upper torso, long bilowing sleeves rolled up around his wrists. Completing the ensemple, a dark green trenchcoat, fastened loosely around the waist, the inside evidently modified for many, many pockets.  Motion, really, is the hallmark of this man: his hands, especially, long and dextrous, always seem to be moving, or toying with something.    //.etro: It is 01:14 am, late night, on Thursday the 11. day of September, 2008.  Penny had been standing, waiting for Jesse so there's like - zero surprise that he slumps on her and even less that he's not-quite chain smoking. "I think we need to walk a little. Where you going? We'll catch up."  Sacha walks west along King to Bay.  Sacha has left.  Sacha arrives from the east.  Sacha has arrived.  Sacha walks east along King to Church.  Sacha has left.  [OOC] Devard offers a yoyo? ;) Bungee cord?  [OOC] Penny snickers.  [OOC] Alyx says "Boomerang ]=)"  [OOC] Devard neds to get some doves..  "Honey Pot" Compton says in his gruff voice, "Two blocks down that ways." he says with all the clairity of a cloud. "You comming?" he asks Daisy.  "No, no. No walk. I'm fine." Jesse waves the tip of his cigarette to gesture how fine he is. And drops it. Into a puddle. So he stares in disbelief at the soaked cigarette, just for long enough to forge he'd been smoking and then it's back to searching for cigarettes, trailing after Penny, and smiling at a point in space roughly a meter and a half to Alyx's left. "Where's Piggy? He always got tweak." Jesse rubs his nose roughly with the back of his hand. "Palindrome time twice since we stood here." He's looking in the puddle again. "Ixat in the puddle, Eye-Led in the windows. Phil Hine says palindrome time is the signpost of synchronicity." He walks, with Penny, away from the group, still speaking. "You know that, Daze? Coincidence making itself known. Dark mirrored nuevaztlani chrometoothed taxis grinning in the oilslick raibbows. Waiting around the corner. Seething to get in. Eleven eleven makes the tetragrammaton a temporal noumenon. Hang loose. Got a smoke?"  Devard walks west along King to Bay.  Devard has left.  You have just received a +recc from Jesse.  If Alyx comprehends even the tiniest fraction of what Jesse just said, it dosen't show. Nope. "Daize, gimme a call when you've got a second, would you?" she calls over to the 'raver' girl, her expression changing to one of grim determination once Devard has made his exit.  Penny meanders with Jesse and keeps up with his babble, talking about iled and nepo, about multiple suns and where the needles go. She gives him another cigarette and hangs loose at Daisy as Jesse's heels fail to keep him aright for very long.  He ain't heavy, he's my brother.  [OOC] Penny says "ttfn - thanks everyone :)"

If you are planning to kill something...then...Plan..oh..wait..that is right...only the holders of the seats are allowed to participate..."  Pobble tromps on out of the ruins, followed by Dave Monkey who has his cigar gripped tight between his teeth as he pulls a 4' square cardboard box along behind him via a length of string. Said monkey does not look terribly pleased at his predicament. Dr Steve however has a slight smile on his face, tapping his cigarette so that the ash floats onto the monkey in a calculated manner.  Alex snort and waves a hand in front of Connelly's eye,"Hello in there... Like I said, Lelio has been a problem for months, more than a year even. I think that alot of consideration has going into this decision."  Alexandre looks between the four of them, then shakes his head, saying, "Well... I pass on the rest of this conversation and will head on out. I believe that this has devolved." He directs his floating ball of soft light over towards the fields and the cave exit. "Good eve..." And then he walks on off towards the exit.  Tal nods in agreement with Alexandre, "I too. I'll go and see how Jesyca and Abel are getting on... or perhaps not." He turns and starts walking off in the direction of the ruins.  Alex shakes his head and turns to head in the direction of the ruins as well, since that is where he was going when he stopped to join the conversation. "No plan is fool-proof. But if we only act on fool-proof plans then we will never do anything."  Pobble stops at the edge of the little gathering, waiting for his companion to catch up. He scans the departing figures, taking a long slow pull on his cigarette and brushing stray ash from the edge of his dress.  "Evenin' awl." he murmers in a sterotyped british policeman manner.  Connelly frowns,"I thought Hermetics could not make plans that could fail?"  Tal has left. The dress wearing blue haired man with the monkey snickers quietly at that.  Alexandre strides across the fields and to the cave. Alexandre heads down the hill and up the other, disappearing into the cavern's darkness. Alexandre has left.  Alex begins down the hill and toward the Ruins. Alex has left.  "Wot's going on 'ere then?" says a tired sounding Dave Monkey, dropping his string and taking a leisurely draw on his cigar.  "I dont know Monkey boy. Seems to be some manner of discussion." replies Dr Steve. "Oi." he continues, pointing at Connelly. "Piker." He calls over. Something seems to dawn on him, and he frowns at the womman, as if trying to remember something. Her name maybe.  Connelly looks at the Monkey,"Oh..just a bit of debate...." She looks at Pobble,"So...when are you planning on fully transitioning before SRS?"  Pobble quirks a brow, looking mildly confused. The relevance dawns on him shortly however and he offers a wan smirk. "I have the right to wear a dress should I feel the need, without it threatening my sexuality in any way. Leaves me free and easy."  "Free and Easy." repeats Dave, smirking in a way that only a monkey can. "You Twat." it adds.  "Pobble reaches into his pocket and pulls out a note pad with a pencil tied to it with string, flipping to a blank page he begins to jot something down, glancing up at you mid way. "Whom intends to attack whom?"   Jennifer is looking at you. Jennifer begins down the hill and toward the Ruins. Jennifer has left.  Connelly ums..."If I tell you, are you going to report it to Daisy? And if she knows...is she just going to take all you guys out to try and take the thing out before anyone can do anything about it?"   Pobble traps his cigarette, then draws, taps, draws the last and tosses it to the side. A step forward quashes it into the earth. "By 'the thing' I'm assuming you mean this Leilo spider critter thing.. Daisy isn't going to take us anywhere. She isn't our leader,." he pauses, continuing his scribbling. He looks between you and the paper a few times. "To be honest, I dont give a shit if this thing is murdering sleepers. Euthies do it all the time and no one says anything."  Connelly nods,"Well..that is what the debate was about....apparently the actual instructions are to mind-wipe this Lelio...kill only if mind-wipe is impossible...but..apparently the decision that it is impossible has already been reached..  Pobble stops his task. Looking down he scribbles one more item, then drops the pencil, letting it hang by its cord from the small pad.  "Mind wipe it whyfor exactly?" he asks. Dave Monkey nods, pulling on his rather short end of cigar. Taking a step back, Dave leans against the cardboard box. "Yeah." he says.  Connelly wells.."Because it knows about Mages, and has threatened to tell the technocracy...."  "It's going to tell the technocrats that Mages exist? That'll be interesting new developments for them eh.." says Dave Monkey.   Dr Steve looks down with an attempt at a silencing glare, ruined by the barely suppressed mirth. "This is the same spider that managed to unawaken that bird right?"  Connelly frowns,"I do not think it was the SPider...I think....she rejected her Avatar....and...in this case, it is the fact that the spider would be telling the technocrats about us, specificly...."  "So, since the mage that went AWOL and decided to reject her Avatar, since for some reason being awakened diddn't agree with her.. since she was seemingly mindwiped, how does the Spider know about 'us'?"  Connelly ums.."Because of things she told him before the Realm's Guardian Mind-wiped her?"  Pobble nods slowly. So does the Monkey, before it pulls the last hot breath from its cigar and tosses it, nudging Pobble in the thigh to stamp it.  "That reminds me, who do the Realm's Guardians answer to?" _________________________  //.etro: Toronto by Night _________________________  Connelly frowns,"As near as I can tell....the Realm itself..."  Pobble rolls his eyes. So does the Monkey. "Which was made by random Hermetics and Choiristers, some time before you got here. It dissappeared and came back and no one really knows much about it or where the nodes that power it are? Right?"  Connelly wells.."It was here when I arrived here..I have no idea who made it....in fact, I do not think anyone really knows...maybe if you could talk to the Guardians of the Realm..."  Jennifer wanders out of the ruins in the distance, slowly closing ground until she has arrived in the heart of the fields.  Jennifer has arrived.  Jennifer pushes back out of the ruins now looking much more at ease.  Connelly shrugs,"I am a Verbena, not a Hermetic...the origin and theory of things do not really concern me...what matters to me about the realm is....it exists..who made it, when, and all that do not matter to me...let a Hermetic worry about those questions.."  Dave Monkey clambers up Pobble's leg enough to retrieve a cigar from the man's pocket. It's in a tin, and the monkey pulls it out under his nose with an expression on its little face that could easily be mistaken for that of a happy pervert. It doesn't light the thing however, being too small perhaps. Instead it runs over to Connelly, holding the end of the cigar like a microphone. "Dave Monkey, here to interview this Irish Wench. Oi. Piker." It calls up, from Connelly's foot. "What is the future of Modern Rock Music?" it asks, in the voice of a serious news reporter.  Meanwhile, Dr Steve frowns. "Fuck." he says quietly, looking between his pad and Connelly and crossing something out, replacing it with something else.   >  Connelly laughs,"The same as the future of all things....to pass and move on...as is the future of this city to crumble to dust as time goes on...." Jennifer stops right at the door and just stares at the monkey and Pobble now. "What the heck..."   Pobble glances at the rearried Jennifer. His hand leaves the pad long enough to wave. He smiles at something, maybe the Monkey and slips the pad back into his pocket. "Dave you Twat." he says quietly, shaking his head amusedly. A last long look at Connelly and he shrugs. "Times to go, things to see, people to do." he murmers. "A pleasure as always."  Dave turns and heads back over to his companion, heading off with him without another word, taking up the string and dragging the Box along once more.

      ***A scene with Jesse and myself, and a random assortment of supporting charcaters. Didn't really go anywhere, but Jesse had some good psycho-babble, and I got to mock Starbucks which I HATE in RL. One of the worst things the States has infected Canada with. I hope the spread of Tim Hortons evens the score.***   Starbucks(#547RIJM)       In the fashion of all Starbucks, this coffee house is styled after the Italian coffee bars where regulars sit at small table and booths and drink espresso with their friends. It provides a seductive atmosphere, sleek yet comfortable. The coffee preparers, known as 'baristas', Italian for bartender, are busy behind the counter preparing various caffeine filled beverages. The aroma of their creations teases your senses. The counter and the entire room feature plenty of burnished wood and brass. About the place sophisticated artwork hangs on the walls. The sound of soft-rock music can be heard over the continuous murmur of the patrons. Through the front window pedestrians can be seen, glancing back at you as the aroma coming through the front door distracts them.                           -- Places Available Here --    Contents: Jennifer Obvious exits: Out     +time //.etro: It is 3:01 pm, late afternoon, on Monday the 22. day of September, 2008.  Compton walks in from the dull heat of a Canadian autum day. He look tired and haggered as he steps in to line with the other caffine junkies and awaits his administration.  Jennifer sips some mocha and seems to be towards the end of reading the daily paper.  As the line slowly crawls forward, the big guy eventually gets to a server, "Large coffee, black." he says simply.   The server of cource, in typical Starbucks pomp asks, "Is that a Columbian, Etheopian, or house blend?"  "Fuck, I dunno, house..." He says with growning annoyance.  "Right, House. Was that caf or no caf?" The highschool student asks as she decends in to the second level of the archane ordering system of the 'bucks.  Compton sighs heavily, and repeats himself firms "Large. Coffee. Black."  The girl behind the counter blinks, and gets that surly minimum wage coffee server look on finally, "You mean Venti?" she asks, twisting the last word in to a sarcastic statement.  "What the fuck ever you stuck up twat. We're in Canada! Not Italy, which I'm sure you don't even speak italian! So why can't you say LARGE?" Compton's yelling now. The manager behind the bar, you know, the one elevated enough not to wear an apron, walks towards the two.  Starbucks manager says, "Sir? Please calm down, she's only doing her job." The pimply manager states. Instantly taking her side.  Jennifer chuckles a little watching now "Chill man... you will get your caffiene fix. Though I must admit even italians aren't this obnoxious  Compton clamps his lips closed. His face and head turning a vivid purple/red color as he simmers. "Lagre coffee. Black." he repeats for the two of them, which amazingly gets the job done this time. The manager nods to his underling, which then turns to pour some black fluid from a pot in to a styrofoam cup, and place it on the counter. Comtpon drops a 'toonie' and 50 cents, and takes his cup to the prep island. "Fucking place. " He grumbles at you as he passes to find himself a lid.  Jennifer laughs amused and nods lightly. "Indeed... mind company if your staying?  Compton snaps a platic lid on his java, and looks at you for a long second. Debating with himself. "Sure" he eventually says with some certanty."Back there" he jerks a thumb over his shoulder towards the back of the room. Then turns and plods off that way.  A small table by the window (#1) has 3 empty places.  A larger table by the front door (#2) has 2 empty places.  A quiet booth in the back (#3) has 6 empty places.  A table near the serving counter (#4) has 3 empty places.  A cozy table for two (#5) has 3 empty places.  A seat at the counter (#6) has 3 empty places.    Present:   Jennifer   A comfortable sofa (#7) has 3 empty places.  A table at the back (#8) has 3 empty places. sit at #8 You sit down at a table at the back.  Jennifer stands and leaves a seat at the counter.  Jennifer gets a new mocha from them before heading over, they have a lot less trouble with hers  after she says Venti White Chocolate Mocha. She settles at your table.  Jennifer sits down at a table at the back.  Jennifer joins you.  Jesse comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. Jesse has arrived.  Compton situates himself so that Jen is between him and the front counter. He makes sure of this by peering over Jennifers shoulder a few times.  Jennifer watches this "What are you doing?" Compton reaches in to his pants, no not the pocket, but down in front. From there he pulls out a small vial of some black viscous fluid, before reaching back in and adjusting himself, "Who me?" he asks with feigned surprise as he puts the boys right again, "Just getting some flavour".  Spotting Jesse by the counter he uses his free hand and waves it in the air.  Jennifer chuckles lightly "Right..." sips her coffee and seems amused  Compton says, in Enochian, "Jesse. In the dark watching."   Four in the afternoon on a Monday. The jobless are just waking up and fiending for the first installment of the day's long infusions of precious caffeine. Jesse lets the door swing shut behind him, drifting into the brasserie and glancing about the midafternoon loafers and layabouts. On seeing Compton, he raises a lazy hand, responding to the wave with a peace sign, then gesturing for a cigarette. "...abiding?"  Compton makes with the 'hangloose' sign, and then pauses looking slightly confused, he then mumbles to Jen, "...you smoke...?"  Jesse positions himself between Compton and the barista, drifting ahead of him in line. "Yeah, cheers. Uh. A medium... no, wait... large... hey, do you guys have Soy back there? Is it good? 'cause, you know... when you steam bad soy, it gets tha nasty flavor? Like, uh... you know. What's it like? Sort of.... burnt blackberries?" Rambling, confused, taking his time with his order. And, if that doesn't take enough time, he's got pockets full of change to lose count of repeatedly.  Compton doesn't wait for a response from her before finishing his 'handiwork' with index amd middle finger held together and pointed right, finsihed witht he 'A-Ok'sign.  Jennifer watches the signs and then shakes her head. "No, I tend to avoid anything affecting my sense of the now, to dangerous these days.  Compton looks back from Jesse to Jen, and raises his brows, crinkling his forhead in deep ridges, "Right, well. Good for you." he says. Barely even remembering the original question, turning back to his uncrotched vial again.  Jesse eventually negotiates for a steaming cardboard cup of something caffeinated and sweet. He gets his drink at the side counter, turns around and leans against the front counter again, once more blocking the barista from Compton as he grins at the old man. "Du sieh'st, mein Sohnday..." He laughs, shakes his head, then shrugs. "Glad to see somebody's awake. Fucking Daze snores s'goddamned loud she's drunk, not even worth pretending to sleep. Plus the goddamned channel button's stuck on the dream box, and all I get is the fucking apocalypse channel."  Jennifer looks curious and asks softly "Dream box?"  Compton peers up once more, at Jesse's incessant diatribe, and snaps the head off the vial.  Compton says, in Enochian, "Whatever fucking god is in charge of this coffee, hear me and do what I say... please."   After Comptons short line in some odd-ball language, the up ends the vial over his steaming coffee and lets the thick fluid lump it's way out.  //.etro: Compton rolls "intelligence+science" at diff 6          For a total of 2 success(es).  Alyx has arrived.  Jesse taps two fingers against the side of his head and nods to the biker. "Yeah. Dream box. Don't work if you're stuck in the now, though." His voice drops into the range of irony and sarcasm for the last phrase, then rises again. "And Jeezis, you seen Freyaday's fucking strapon? Gnostic apotheosis of wood my ass that's fucking creepy. Element that does not unnecessarily reproduce. Fuck your mother I can't even look at her straight since she got Freya." He sniffs. "His name's Apollo. The one you're talking to. Who else?"  //.etro: Compton rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 1 success(es).  Jennifer blinks looking between Jesse and Compton trying to piece together whatever it is they are babbling about now.  The fluid disapears in to Comptons coffee. With but a short undulating of the surface as if it's being stirred from below, it look absolutly like it did before. The old guy picks up his cup , and takes a sip. Smiling for the first time since he's been here.  Starbucks is blessed with the arrival of another patron - Alyx. Though it's mid-afternoon, she looks like she might not actually have been out of bed all that long, as she trudges towards the counter, in search of life-giving coffee. Only to order....decaf.  Jesse moves away from where he'd been leaning against the counter, a nod and a raise of his foamed something to Alyx when she walks in. Leaning instead against the closest table, he sets his coffee down, pulls a film canister from his satchel, shakes a couple of pills from it, and washes them down with the steaming drink. "Here's to the reverend Sun Yun Moon."  Jennifer excuses herself pushing her chair back. "Be right back." heads in for the bbathroom Jennifer stands and leaves a table at the back. Jennifer has departed.  The smell of cooked liver seems to be eminating from the back of the room. Where Jennifer and Compton are sitting. This mixes with the coffee bean smell closer to the door. But closer tot he rear, the acrid bile smell is hard to ignore.   Jesse winces, shaking his head and sighing as he watches Compton drink his coffee. "Did the Brit turn you onto that shit?" Another sip. "Thought you were supposed to be..." He looks at the old man, frowning with curiosity. "Tell me that's not some goldberg backalley shortcut to the kaywhole."  Alyx flicks Jesse a casual salute as she collects her mug of caffine-less coffee, sipping the brew with apparent relief. "Mm. yo, sailor," she muses to the obscured Elvis, while offering Compton a friendly smile as well.  "Hey." Jesse cracks a crooked grin. "How's my favorite shark in the meme pool?" He pauses, rubbing the bridge of his nose as he looks down for a moment. "...pool meme?" Jokes have a way of getting out of control shortly after the consumption of an entheogen, you see.  Compton looks up from his 'coffee' at Jesse and his smile fades a bit to a smirk, "It's not. Drinking 'Ire-ish' cream today." he replies, a funny inflection placed on the word Irish. He then gives Alyx the old 'finger-gun salute'.  Jesse nearly spits his coffee with sudden laughter at Compton's comment. "Nice."  "Want some?" he offers his now suspect cup of fluid to the 'King'. Comptons eyes have become somewhat glassy in the last few minutes.  Alyx winks at Jesse. "Alive and seeking blood?" she quips, gesturing to her coffee, before blowing Compton a kiss. It must be one of those random-impulse things. "You?"  Jesse shakes his head no. "No. I'm supposed to be crazy for a week, not Irish. That big red shit's rotting my teeth out, I swear." He turns back to Alyx and gives a lazy shrug. "Bringing the war, rallying the masses. Repelling invasions from the shores of my brain. Usual shit for a Monday."  The pimply manager from behind the counter, starts shooting annyoyed looks at the rear of the establishment. Comptons already had a run in with him, and the pencil-necked twerp would ove nothing more than to have an excuse to have the cops called in on him. The acrid smell comming from the area is most likely what's tipping him off. Unfortunatly there's a fre back there, and he can't just go throwing people out. It might be that skaggy looking biker bitch after all.  "Sounds thrilling," Alyx remarks to Jesse's comment, smiling languidly. "Me, I'm happy with just marshalling my thoughts together into an orderly line and letting them die one by one under a wave of sweet coffee."  "Ideas are born dead." The old hipster comments uninvited, "It's whwere you hide the bodies that's important." Apaprently that made sense enough to him to say aloud.  I heard there was a secret chord  that David played and it pleased the lord.  Jesse's headphones are broadcasting music still, curled laurel-like about the base of his neck. Stretching in place, the gaunt houngan tilts his head to one side, staring absently at the large Starbucks logo on the opposite wall. "This place is so weird. Full on Tibetan Black Hat Fong Shway. Mining the dragon lines and clusterbombing neighborhoods. They're so good. So very good at what they do. You walk in anywhere, and you're on their planet and in their warm and cloying radiance. I... it's absorbing. It's a flytrap it is." He glares at the mermaid in the logo. "...wake us and we drown. This would be a horrific place to wake up, in sight of the sirens."  Jennifer steps back out of the bathroom looking around then heading back over.  "But they have nice shitters." Compton adds, "Best place to take a public dump if need be." he says this nodidng at Jen as she returns, "And they're always single seaters, so you can lok the person in the eye, who waiting to go in next, after you've nuked the place. It's important to know your victems afterall, right?" he asks, now nodding to Alyx and lifting his cup of 'stuff'and taking another belt.  Alyx finds herself a seat near Compton, kicking her feet up on the tabletop once she's settled. "Foul beast. I bet it's you that keeps blocking up the toilet at McDonalds, isn't it," she accuses mildly.  Alyx sits down at a table at the back. Alyx joins you.  Jennifer snags her seat, her mocha is there after all and settles down by Alyx now. "So whats up Alyx?""  "This one time in fresno," Jesse begins, mumbling a low, steady torrent of rounded syllables, his lips drooping sluggishly around the words, "I'd shot in the bathroom and when I came out, the coke was wah wah wahing and bleaching my vision and everything was poing pinprick, past tunnel vision, you know?"   "So I'm sitting and whiteknuckling it, praying that I don't OD right then and there in the middle of the fucking starbucks and behind the wah wahs, behind the white light, the only thing in the tunnel was the mermaid and she's singing under the music in here."   "It's why they have their own CDs. They're running NLP scams all the time. Soporifics. Audio vicodin. And so I tune into the signal, and she's smiling at me and... and the reason they've got good bathrooms is 'cause they've got soulcatchers up for all the poor junkies who OD looking for a safe warm place to be left alone."  Innocent until proven guilty, ma'am." Compton retorts, "To have Daisy tell it, its an Hamas plot."  "There ya go." Compton says in coda of Jesses explaination.  Alyx eyes Jesse bemusedly. "I can think of worse fates than to be sung to death by a mermaid," she observes, head cocking to the side slightly. "And it serves you right for shooting up in a place where caffine rules supreme. There's only room for /one/ drug in this here cafe," she adds, the latter comment spoken in a western-style cowboy's accent.  "If the mermaids sing you to death, you don't get to wake up when you die." Jesse rubs his face sorrowfully, looking around and frowning. "You're stuck here, back in this place, for another spin of the wheel."  Jennifer sips her mocha and falls to listening now.  Jesse shrugs, shaking his head no. "No, that's the problem. The lesson isn't learned. You don't get to wake up. They catch you and keep you here. Asleep. Drunk. Smoldering in the wet ashes."  You say, "Caffine is the new religion, and the opium for the masses. This place is an opium den, just with fucking pompus Italian words of things like LARGE!"  Compton hits the last word hard and loud, shooting it over that he manager behind the counter. The peckerwoods eyes narrowing back at the outburst.  Jennifer laughs "He got into a near riot with the staff when they insisted on calling it a Venti.. it was great  Jane comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. Jane has arrived.  "Oy, calm down, you two," Alyx murmurs to Compton and Jesse. "They like to pretend they've got italian backgrounds - who are we to dispell their little dreamworld?"  We heard Ian Curtis Killed himself again In your bed.  Jesse's headphones maintain the quiet radius of their sound. Shoulders drooped, he hasn't looked away from the logo behind the bar since he started on this. Cap pulled low, he slouches against the table, the effects of the entheogen on his pupils hidden by the shadows of the brim. "Language is a gun. They know this and so do we. Only problem is, we're holding the end that goes boom."  Jesse is leaning against a table, legs crossed at the ankles, a cup of apidly cooling foamed something ignored behind him. He is staring across the room at the logo behind the wall. He is tripping, though it might not be obvious since he's also probably insane. He's carrying the bass and tenor ranges of a conversation to which Compton has the percussion and the alto ranges - Jesse is a low, steady mumble. Compton is the jarring explosion of ire and invectives. @emit There is a rather strong odour of cooked liver comming from where Jennifer is stting, which also happen to be where Compton, Alyx and Jesse are all aroudn too. There is a rather strong odour of cooked liver comming from where Jennifer is stting, which also happen to be where Compton, Alyx and Jesse are all aroudn too. We don't talk about love. / We only want to get drunk  Jesse lifts his cup to his lips, blowing across its surface before sipping again at the nearly congealed fam and sugar concoction. He rolls his head, stretching his neck, then finally looks away from the logo, blinking as he returns his attention to his surroundings.  "So E Rock. 'tsa plan today? Penn and I started a new gig last night. Want we should keep it rolling?"  Jane sniffs a couple of times, then heads towards the counter, to order Jennifer finishes off her mocha and hms contemplating a refill now. Ah the simple decisions  Compton sucks the last of the vile fluid from his cup, and crumples the remains in his hand, leaving it on the table for one of the minions to pick up, "Sure thing Jazzy-J." the big guy responds, "Tell me."  Jesse says, in Enochian, "Monkey wrenching. Reclaimed a sign. Liberate the logosphere."   Jesse switches abruptly to english, after a few phrases in another language. "Anyway so I was reading Deleuze again and he's got this rhizome schtick, dig? And so I'm thinking that we need to figure out this schizoanalysis thing. Run it past Piggy, maybe use it as a schema for the son et lumiere cutups we've been talking about?"  Compton says, in Enochian, "Dig. Want we should take an infidel along?"   Jane pauses in her passage to the bar to glance around at the language students, then returns to her passage to the bar. Jesse shakes his head no. He says, in Enochian, "Don't trust a one of them."   Compton says, in Enochian, "I don't either. But after Daze and Hiros stunt, thought it might be fun to drag the enemy along, make them destroy their own world."   Compton quips back at Jesse in their strange and etherial language.  Compton stands and looks to Jesse, and says with a shrug, "Whatever. Is all static anyways. Static and wind."  Jesse laughs, still shaking his head no. "Dude. Porcupines fucking, dig? C'mon - for serious. Deleuze. Schizoanalysis. Rhizomes. Piggy hero running cutups on the big screen. Can you build a, uh..." He gestures vaguely. "You know. A thing. To synchronize video cuts to a drumbeat?" Jane collects her coffee, and leans against the counter, watching the bilingual banter, with a faintly amused air  Compton mimics Jesse's hand motions, "Yeah, yeah - a thing. Speak right you fucktard. You mean a Digi-analog editor?" he says with some sense of authority.  "Language is a gun. They know this and so do we. Only problem is, we're holding the end that goes boom." Jesse nods slowly, scratching the stubble on his cheek, and takes another slow sip of his coffee, then tilts his head to one side, turning to Compton. "So E Rock. 'tsa plan today? Penn and I started a new gig last night. Want we should keep it rolling?"  "Sure thing Jazzy-J." the big guy responds, "Tell me."  Jesse says, in Enochian, "Monkey wrenching. Reclaimed a sign. Liberate the logosphere."   Compton replys to Jesse's question again, with a smoothness and clairty totally undercutting the odd redundancy.  Compton says, in Enochian, "Dig. Want we should take an infidel along?"   Jesse shakes his head, rubbing the back of his neck, and glances across the bar, watching the transactions at the counter, money for coffee, priced by the adjective. "Anyway so I was reading Deleuze again..." A tug at the brim of his cap, another sip, "... and he's got this rhizome schtick, dig? And so I'm thinking that we need to figure out this schizoanalysis thing." Staring into the foam as though reading his future in its waves and eddies. "Run it past Piggy, maybe use it as a schema for the son et lumiere cutups we've been talking about?" Jane sips her coffee quietly, still watching, and apparantly listening to, the interplay.  Compton reaches up and scrathes beneith his mullet, "Idea. There's the big Sony on the east side. All electronics. Easy to do."  Jesse turns, folding himself into a seat and sprawling back in it, one leg splayed out, the other bent beneath. His dirty fingernails drum along with the soft tinny music from the headphones around his neck. Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk. "Peaches can probably get knockoffs cheap, though."  Jesse sits down at a table at the back. Jesse joins you.  Compton apparently ready to leave, stops and returns to his seat as plans seem to change like the wind.  You say, "No you feeb. The sign, sign. Easy of here. The big Sony sign."  Jennifer looks between them and shakes her head slipping back tothe counter. Jennifer orders herself another Mocha  Jane says, "Now, didn't someone write...." Jane says, in Enochian, "You wouldn't want people to mistake you for a bunch of vandals, would you?"   Jesse blinks, wincing at Compton's diatribe, then pans across to Jane's addition. A laugh, blurted out, and he shakes his head. "Fuck off, geezer. I'm the fucking Moonie this week, I'm supposed to be nuts." Then he tugs his capbrim at Jane. "Jaytee. Eye See. Pleasedta."  Compton says, in Enochian, "I'd rather be mistaken for a pron star able to put my cock in my ear, but that's about as likely."   Compton grimices like he just bit his tounge, "Fuck, ow." apparently he did, "Mean't porn sthar... but whatefer, you goth the point." he says, a lisp appearing.  Jane nods gravely, "You can call me Doctor Smith. Delighted."  "So, Smitty, what's all this about who wrote what where and why?" Jesse grins over his coffee, his splayed boot reeling itself in slowly, until its heel is hooked on the lip of his chair's seat, offering his elbow a comfortable perch on the resultingly raised knee.  Compton leans back in his chair, the cheap pine of it creaking beneith his mass, be crosses his arms acorss his chest and goes in to full grouch-mode.  Jane says, "You haven't read that quote? But it's from the book you were quoting... and so beautfully too, if you don't mind me mentioning it. You have a lovely accent, far nicer than mine.... I bet you went to a Private school, didn't you?"  Jesse shakes his head no. "Home schooled." A grin, hidden under a tug of his hat, his face realigned under the brim's shadow. "What book was I quoting? When? Geezer, was I quoting something again?" He knocks twice on the side of his head with his hand's heel. "Sorry. Bad habit of doing that, I've got. Transparancy to broadcast media. Bitch of a thing." He sniffs. "So. Uh. Right. When were we? Here. Wo weilest du, meine sohn? Did we have a plan and I've forgotten it, or are we about to make one?"  Jennifer has disconnected.  Compton lisps out with his swelling tounge, "Yer dah Moonie, where you lead I'd follow. Want I should call Pobsy or just hail a cab?"  You give me a rope, I'll hang myself. / It doesn't take a genius to figure it out. Don't have to be fucking brilliant to see / I'm not as smart as I seem to be.  The digitally pilfered sounds from Jesse's personal audiosphere fade in and out of intelligibility, snippets of lyrics escaping into the lacunas of conversation. He frowns, watching his toe move from side to side, then looks back to Compton. "Huh? I think the Brit's holed up again. Daze was snoring like she was drunk and I didn't see piggy so I figure the brit cooked something up last night while me and Penn were out. Don't think he's in the game right now."   He pulls a knockoff palm pilot from his satchel, held together with electrical tape, and pokes at it with his stylus. "Lemme ask the ancients." He squints at the flat green screen. "I ching says... hexagram fifty six. Lu. The Wanderer. That's Ahasuerus. What's it say..." He reads, from the six thousand year old chinese divination system, digitally encoded onto the Malaysian ersatz handheld computer.   "The situation is shifting, and Yang (the active masculine force) is gaining ground." "I think that's Penny." The future is embodied in Hexagram 49, Ko. Revolution. What takes place is believed in only after it has been accomplished. There will be great progress and success. Advantage will come from being firm and correct. In that case, occasion for repentance will disappear. "  You say, "I guess that sets it then. We have a plan."  Jane chuckles, listening idly, whilst she keeps sipping her coffee.  Jesse shakes his head no. "One, I think it's bad to pull the same stunt twice, two it's monday which is my day which means, uh... I forget, but it had something to do with the water. And three, I think we should make Hiro dress in drag because it's his fucking week to be Judy and he hasn't left his room once."  Compton uncrosses his arms and stretches. Folding them behind his head, and interlackinbg his fingers together under his mullet. "Fine we stay. Don't know what the entire Wandering kike thing had anything to do with anything then."  Alyx stirs from what could only be a coffee-induced daydream, chiming in, "Judy? Who's Judy?"  You say, "This week? Pig boy."  "He pissed Jesus off and got cursed to wander the earth 'till the second serpent came back." Jesse frowns, shrugging. "Dunno, man. Maybe it's a keep your head down? At least we got Ko for the future. That's pretty bitching. Hiro's Judy. I was, now he is. I'm the Moonie. On account of I gotta be a lunatic for a while. E Rock's mein sohn, and he's a great big kaywhole."  Jane contemplates for a moment or two, then remarks, as though to herself, "I think this routine was funnier when it was the Marx brothers doing it."  Jesse shakes his head no to Jane, and shrugs. "Ego Identity is one of the seven chakras. The seven qlippoth that bind the soul to the body. They burned the books where Jesus laughed. All part of the prison. Just another black iron wall to tunnel through."  Jane corrects slightly. "Chain. Black iron chain. And it's 'to cast off'."  Compton starts to glare poignantly at Jane, and her all too helpful corrections.  "Prison. Black Iron Prison." He shrugs. "Or chain. Whatever. Point being, it's their world and their language and their game. Cheat codes or no, we're still playing until we can find the off switch. And that's just not anywhere on the grid."  At your table Compton grumbles, "This one is the enemy, I swear it."  Jane says, "Which all sounds terribly mystic and rebellious, until you realise it was written pretty much identically in the 9th century."  "We're still living in the first century. It's a prison. The Empire never ended." Jesse's voice finds that familiar low monotono mumble with which he lets these diatribes spill. "God - the divine intelligence orbitting and forgotten outside the spacetime donut, God shoots phosphene lasers of sentient infomation that look like Kandinski paintings. From outside, dig? Into the prison. To wake us up. The Naassenes were burned, the Docetists crushed. Origen's been edited out, and we bomb the fuck out of the Sufis whenever they settle down long enough that they might actually start writing something."  At your table Jesse says "Yes. People like her are why we have the sixth protocol."  Compton lowers his arms, and toys with his crushed cup on their table. Letting Jesse tell it how it is. Jane says, "And the Bulgars, and the Gnostics?"  Jesse, of course, is speaking from that curious transparent place where he doesn't know the difference between 'I went to the library and read VALIS' and 'God shot lasers into my brain.'  "The Gnostics turned invisible and dissapeared." He shrugs. "Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion. It's all the same game, they just trade hats offstage."  Jane says, "I believe they had a little help..." Jane says something in a language you don't understand.   Jane says, "To coin a phrase."  Jesse shakes his head no, shrugging.  "I don't know what I think I am, Smitty. But I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I'm not some private school jailyard bully. I didn't learn the cheats just so I could fuck with the sheep, or wage some pointless pretend play war against an enemy I created." He pulls the threadbare brim of his hat low over his eyes. "I'm not a scholar. I'm not writing a term paper. I am the weight swinging at the end of the golden chain. I am the bullet fired from a gun two thousand years old. You're having morning coffee and arguing semantics. I'm trying to figure out the next brick to break." He snorts. "People like you are why we have a sixth protocol."  Compton reaches over, his big and unfolding into a flat palm, and brigs it upside the back of Jesse's head.   "Shudup Jes. You talk too much." he says flatly.  Jesse yelps, bringing his hands up to hold the sides of his head. "Ow! Fucker!" He glares at Compton, but slumps in his seat and, blessedly, stops talking.  "Sorry ma'am." the big guy says mollifying, "He's a fucked up lil junk whore. Just ignore him." he's saying this towards Jane, and not the dozing Alyx whose missing all the fun as usual.  Jane says, "Yes... yes, I noticed. Which is a shame, because in there somewhere are some interesting paraphrasings of early medieval heretic mystics." She smiles blandly, "I did my PhD on something not dissimilar. It's nice to hear them in a modern context."  Jesse is sulking. Eyes downcast, studying the stains on his knees. Fingers winding and unwinding. Lips pursed, jaw clenched, a savage frown drawing the sharp angles of his face into jagged relief. He does not, however, make a sound.  Marion comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. Marion has arrived.  Marion walks in the door and glances around before moving to the counter and placing an order for a White Chocolate Grande Mocha along with a couple of rasberry scones.  Daisy has arrived.  Jesse is sitting, his back to a table, his hat pulled low, glaring down at his knees. Sulking, in other words.  Marion pays for her food and drink, then snags a paper before walking over to an empty table and sitting.  Compton shakes out his hand, and returns to playing with the crumpled coffee cup in front of him.  Alyx seems to be snoozing upright in her seat. Don't expect much there.  Marion sits down at a quiet booth in the back.  Jane is leaned against the counter, sipping coffee, and has apparantly just been talking to the group of misfits, for she is regarding them with a look of faint amusement. It's a Starbucks. It's just like any Starbucks.  Enter one (1) faux bohemian, beret cocked 45 degrees, cigarette likewise at a 45 degree angle in her mouth, sunglasses, likewise, tilted -- these by virtue of having only one arm, rather than by her choice -- on her head.  One double mocha skinny.  No, you have to call the size by it's Italian name.  It therefore takes Daisy a long time to order, during which sh eidles.  The pencil necked manager that gave Compton a hard time earlier approached the counter where Daisy is standing and says in this weedly little voice, "Excuse me miss? Excuse me? This is a NON-smoking establishment." he sneers, pointing at the red crossed out ciggy icon, and the 'Maximum Fine $5000" printing at the bottom.  Jane glances at her watch, and sighs. "Still, however delightful it is to wander through the garden of bright images, are we not distracting your mind from other, more important, matters?" And with that, she drains her cup, places it on the counter, and starts towards the door.  Jesse looks up. Sees Daisy. Resumes the mumble. "Oi. Daze. My head fucking hurts. Sonny hits too hard. I'm just doing what I'm supposed to. Lunacy. Water. Sun Yun Moon, right? Right. So, the mesc's hitting my fucking Visuddha chakra and everyone's all weird and..." He glances sideways at Compton and abruptly cuts off the ramble, dropping his eyes back to the floor.  Jane walks out into the busy world leaving the rich aroma of Starbucks behind. Jane has left.  Marion seems oblivious to everything around her as she calmly reads her paper and eats her food.  "I wandered lonely as a cloud, that floats on high o'er vales and hills....when all at once, I saw a crowd...." Alyx murmurs, stirring from her daydream once more, smiling beautificly at those around her. One might almost imagine her to be stoned, except she hasn't been seen taking anything since she entered.  Of cource there's probably enough psycho-actives airating from her table mates, that nothing can be assumed at this point. Compton frowns and crosses his arms again, and mutters somthing akin to an appology to Jesse for manhandling him. As much fun as that sounds, it rarely is.  Jesse shakes his head no, shrugging it off. "Still think she needed a reroll. See how she likes it, she's the one against the wall."  You say, "Not arguing. Just not yet. Pretend Peachy was here."  "Peachy?" Alyx wonders, sipping from her by-now-very-cold coffee, and making a face. "....shit. Someone should invent coffee that dosen't get cold so fucking quickly."  Jesse's mouth opens to respond, then closes again, and he nods. "Right. What would Peaches do?" He frowns. "Prolly sew my lips shut again like last time. You have any idea how much that hurt?" Marion murmers softly to herself as she turns the page on her paper, shaking her head on occasion as she reads something.  Compton's demeanour lightens some at this, "Ah, you liked it. We all know." and then raises a hand and snaps his fingers in the air a few times, raising his voice towards the peckerwood manager bugging Daisy, "Oh garcon? Service?" he calls out, knowing full well that's not how it usually works in here.  "Wel, maybe. But the whole Xombi show afterward - sewing my clothes shut, turning my pockets inside out... fucking lame. Why doesn't Peachy every have to be the Moonie?" Jesse shakes his head and finishes the last of his coffee. "Where can we go that lets us smoke?"  "The Pot?" Compton says perking up considerably.  "Sure. Dude who owns it wanted to give me a deejaying gig there. Figured I should check it out." Jesse nods. "Actually, we need to get four together and talk about that place. Got a couple of questions I need to ask the egregore about."  Marion glances up from her paper and looks over at the counter person and smiles, tshe stands up and goes back over and hands thecup back and makes hand signs.. which the counter girl returns. She laughs at some extra handsigns she makes and nods. "Oh yes. It does take that many to screw in a lightbulb." she winks.  "Right. Whatever. Sure." Compton agrees with Jesse in short order. Apparently the idea of nekkid dancing ladies is good with him, "Ya think Daze would want to go?" then looks down at Alyx, "Or you? Nothing finer than a chick goin' to a strip club." He says this, which in all likely hood considered a compliment from him, but falls short in to the tactless dustbin.  Marion chuckles and pays for her refill, then wanders back over to her seat and folds the paper over to the comic strips.  "I've already been," Alyx replies brightly to Compton. "Mr Browne is a lovely host, you know. I can really reccomend the place, and yes, I'll tag along."  ***At this point we lost most of our cast for OOC reasons. I'm assuming we all went of to the Honey Pot. Compton most likely got loaded, molested one of the dancers, then got thrown in to a dumpster by the bouncers.***

      ***Okay. A scene with Penny, Tiziano and Compton. Just a improv home invasion dealie that turns in to a attempted double hommicide. Unfortunatly it broke down in to a 4 hour timestop due to some rather over-assumptive RP.I've left in the OOC banter although it breaks up the scene messily, I thnk it needs to be recorded what we went through and how simplistically Tiziano reasoned. We should steer clear of him in the future to avoid OOC messes like this. Oh, and lobbed bagels do not an enchantment make!***  A taxi pulls up and Compton gets out.  //.etro: It is 04:28 am, the dead of night, on Tuesday the 23. day of September, 2008.  Compton climbs out of his cab in front of the Holliady Inn. He looks like death warmed over, or that he slept in a dumpster for a few hours. _________________________  //.etro: Toronto by Night _________________________ Name          Sex Mode    Idle  Type  Short Description ______________________________________________________________________________  Charice        F   IC      1m   Pl    - Allen          M   IC      3m   Pl    - POLICE LINE - Wn   -       -    Obj   - Compton        M   IC      1s   Pl    Middle aged guy wearing a hawiian shirt. ______________________________________________________________________________   There is a police line around the Whiskey Saigon and a sign on the door that reads: "CLOSED UNTIL FURTHUR NOTICE".  Allen's hand falls back to his side as he gives Charice one more appraising look, lips still curled into an amused little grin. The two stand off down the sidewalk a bit from the Whiskey Saigon. "Could be fun to try, but I'll pass on payin'." he says, dark eyes glittering with amusement.  Charice reaches out to take Allen's left hand in her right one, cooing softly at him, "Awww sugar, aren't I worth a bit of money. If I don't bring some cash home my pimp womps on my ass. You don't want that...do ya?" smiling at the man and letting her duster fall to her elbows, showing much more then before.  As the cab pulls away, Compton staggers for a few feet towards the Hotel, before giving up and sitting on the curb, holding his head in his hands.  Allen chuckles softly, but doesn't resist his hand being taken. He lets that little ploy work, seemingly swayed a bit as he looks at the revealed skin. "I doubt I'm the only one you'd find tonight." he replies, grinning crookedly. "Depends on if you'd rather have fun, or make a buck."  Charice looks over her shoulder at Compton for a moment, as if debating something in her head. She looks back to Allen and rubs her finger over his hand gently, "You're the first John tonight and probably for the rest of the night sugar. So either you pay or I go across the street and flirt with him." motioning over at Compton.  Allen laughs at that, amused and following Charice's gaze towards Compton. "Him? I doubt he'd keep you amused for ten minutes.." he shakes his head almost sadly, "But if you want to waste yer time on the attempt.." he chuckles and flashes a toothy grin. "Or you can take a chance... never know."  Penny has arrived.  Allen is standing off to the side of the street maybe half a block from the Whiskey. Standing rather close to Charice and engaged in conversation with her it would seem, she holding one of his hands in hers.  Compton is sitting on the curb where the cab dropped him off out front of the Hotel. He's cradeling his head in his hands. Looking kind of rough, and from the smell, he's been sleeping in a dumpster.  Charice looks between Allen and Compton and says, "I don't know, he's looking more and more attractive right now. And chances only get this whore a black eye and out fifty bucks...so you either pay me for my time or I move my ass elsewhere, sugar."  Penny is walking because it's 5am and that's what she does. She walks and hums to herself and maybe there's a downbeat to her step. Could be she's plugged into something that makes her walk that way. Thump-chucka, thump thump-chucka. Penny's still bobbing her head when she steps on Compton's foot. Really it was an accident. "Old man," over-doing it on the volume it's a kind of greeting.  Allen laughs, "Allright, you've got a deal. Fifty, maybe a tip if you're a good girl." his lips quirked in an impish little grin as he stands there before the taller woman. At least with that footwear, she's got a good two inches or more on him, though he doensn't seem to be aware of that. Except maybe for the fact that certain things are closer to eye level. Charice grins, "I assure you good is too weak of a word for what I am. Come on and let me show you heaven. You wanna ride on the back of my bike?" Tugging him along as she heads over to the Harley near Whiskey Saigon.  Compton flinches with the sudden outburst so close to his abused head. His mellon wobbles in its precarious pearch on his shoulders, and he looks up at the woman standing on his foot, "Fuck... Penny." he says after a second of recognition kicks in, "Shhhhhh." is all he can say in after thought.  Allen steps away from the wall, stepping up next to Charice. "You sure that thing'll last the trip?" he asks curiously, "Sounded kinda iffy on the way in."   Charice chuckles slightly, "The guy I had fixing my bike for blow jobs ran off on me...don't worry though, she's reliable. Get us back to my pad in no time, long as you don't mind riding on the back. No one drives my hog." Grabbing the helmet and offering it to him first. Slipping on her driving gloves and doing up hre duster.  Allen waves off the proffered helmet, not seeming to be overly concerned. "Must not have been very good blowjobs then." he says as he waits for her to mount the bike, then swings up on the back of the seat and drapes an arm around her waist.  "Y'r.." she starts but the old man says quiet so she's quiet. But not her headphones. They're still spouting a static thrum, a humming drum and she's smiling. Smiling so big and so wide, crouching down behind Compton, Penny makes a face. Quiet as a mouse.  Charice snorts at the man on the back of her bike, "Naw, the guy was too whimpy for me. Didn't like being tied up." Slipping her helmet on and reving up her bike before moving the kickstand, "Let's haul ass!"  Penny mutters to Compton, "Fucking... Did you see it?" Penny mutters "Fucking strange. Did you see it?"  "Yeah, yeah of cource I saw it.... Saw what exactly." Compton asks from his stupor.  Charice walks east along King to University. Charice has left. Allen walks east along King to University. Allen has left.  Penny says, "She had fucking HORNS man. HORNS. S'fucked up, man." Not that anything can really bother Penny. She rolls and it's all good "So's your stink. S'up with that? You gone dumpster diving again?"  "Right.... horns. yeah." Compton continues in a daze. "Dunno. Woke up in one. Was with Jes at the peelers... then..." his voice dies off as his forehead krinkels up on concentration, which visibly pains him.       The sound of bumper cars fill the air of Toronto's central bar area. Dim light-gray pattern webs sullenly sway from the barely perceived buildings. If you listen closely you may hear carousel music from the location of Whiskey Saigon. Chaotic sounds of pinball machines ping from Dirk Gently's. Clicking noises like those of a railroad track are heard from the Power Bar. The familiar web covered vehicles crawl by. A reddish stain, like some sluggish invading flood, creeps across the ground of the area covering everything in its way. The pattern spiders appear to be avoiding coming anywhere near the spreading stain.       Penny scoots over on the curb and plants her ass there. The cold doesn't seem to hinder her bounce; hasn't come down yet. "You didn't do that thing with him where you bet and he wins, did you.. y'know you shouldn't play with Jesse. He always wins." Little contemplative, she stucks on the wires of her headphones, winds her fingers up in them "Seriously. Never seen him miss a mark. So what happened?"  Compton grinds a hand in to one of his eyeballs. trying to abrasivly remote a bender cataract, "Beats me. Last thing I remeber is going in to a booth with this sweet sweet ripper. Jes was talking to another girl about the meaning of reality I think. Dumbass."  Compton plucks at his Don Ho classic and takes a wiff, instantly regretting it. "Holy shit." is all he can say.  Penny nngs and gets up a little off the curb, adjusts and resettles herself. You could say she's feeling sympathy. Or something. "Really. They have the raw sweet and the dirty sweet, too. Met a few tonight. Consider another setting. The alley isn't suitable anymore. This isn't San Francisco."  And then she adds "You didn't get ripped off, did you."  Compton's head is just bobbing in that non-comittal 'yeah I'm listening' kind of way. But the pained look on his face says he's trying hard to understand the words you are forcing in to his spongy brain. After a long second, his grey matter catches up to the back log, and he reacts to your question, reaching around to his ass and poking for his wallet. "Yeah. Still got my stuff." then pokes his left cheek a few times with his hand, "Don't think it was the girl. I think someone suckered me... Bouncer. Yeah. Was the fucking bouncer!" he says, his voice rising as the memorys get kicked out of the smoldering ash of his brain. The fog's started to roll in. Weird weather they have here; and it's not a soup-to-nuts kind of fog, not that thick road-to-Berkeley fog either. It's a fog like hairspray that refuses to stay put. Penny reaches into the air and pulls at it a few times. "Isn't thick enough to write in," half smiling "I was gonna tell it to make you smell pretty."  And that other noise, that's her feet. She hasn't really stopped moving, can't sit still. Can't help the tick. "She had horns. Pale sticky halo, too. Where'd'you think horns come from?" She asks this and when she asks she sounds like a child asking about babies.  "Maybe she can't sing?" Compton deadpans.  With a grunt, some squeaking at the knees and much effort, Compton hauls himself to his feet, swaying slightly,"I honeslty have no fucking idea what you're talking about toots." he says. "I need a shower." No shit sherlock, but admitting it is the first step.  Penny tilts her head to the side, ear bud slipping out emitting the noise of some remix. Hard beats. Thirty revolutions per minute. "Maybe she stepped on a crack." She reaches her hands up. Up. Up. Pull her up. "I saw her. When you told me to shush, I shushed and Looked."   "Technically it's not work. Not if I enjoy it. Right?"  Compton peers at you for a second, like you're out of your fucking mind, then with a sigh, bends over again, his joints protesting. Grabs a hold of your wrists and leans back, trying hard to stay upright.  You say, "You mean the whore?"  Her knees crack, too. Whatever she was doing tonight, it was hell on her joints. "Yes, her. She's gonna eat that boy I bet. I'da but that's not my job this week. M'not allowed," eye drooping down, twisting sideways. "This not working shit blows. Hotel?"  Compton simply nods and turns Holiday way, "So, ya'd eat 'em eh?" he says.  Walking is slow going. Walking pace is set by Penny because that is how it works this week. "Yes, I would. If I were a girl. Freya, though, she's a bitch and a half to handle. Makes me all," pulsing her hand open and closed, open, closed like people do with stressballs "hungry. Famished. Like I'm fasting from the ebb and flow. I donno."  "Ya can raid the continental breakfast bar on the way up." Compton offers, moving none too quickly himself, "This whole Days thing just fucks me up. Not good with roles... not good with responsibility. Someday one of you are going to give me the shit, and I'm gonna fuck it up, I tell ya."  Penny enters the Holiday Inn lobby area. Penny has left.  Holiday Inn(#2848RnAJ)       This spacious lobby area has many comfortable seats and a fire place. It is very clean, except for the clutter of baggages placed on the floor by the people checking in or out. Loads of magazines are organized on a centrally located coffee table. The front desk has a couple of employees signing in guests. A gift shop entrance is located right next to the front desk area, displaying all sorts of Ontario and Canada goodies for the passing tourist to purchase. A large area opens up through a passage way on the far side of the lobby and the faint scent of chlorine drfits in from a heated pool out of sight.

"You couldn't fuck it up. There's no such thing," all matter-of-fact and absoposilutely, nodding along to a song she can only half hear. Guitars now. Wailing vocals. Johnny Cash. "Just as there is no such thing as coincidence. It's all connected. It's all good."  She knocks on the door to a room. It's not our room. She still knocks. Penny knocks on the door marked #158. Penny knocks on the door marked #156.  Tiziano leaves an apartment. Tiziano has arrived.  Compton is standing outside Room 159 with Penny. At the room that isn't theirs where Penny is talking to the door, saying things like "He's probably passed out. He probably got one look at himself in that sailor moo.." when the door opens. No one there to greet her at eye-level, she looks down.  The door opens up and Tiziano pokes out his head looking about. He is dressed as if he has just gotten up and out of bed looking over towards the woman then man, "Hey I remember you.." he trails off, "What are you doing here?"  "Candygram." Compton deadpans.  Penny looks at Compton. He doesn't have candy. He has croissants and stale bagels in a basket with those little brown stirry things for coffee. And about fifty packets of sugar. totally unapologetic, and even a little 'up' for the hour, Penny goes on like this is totally normal. "I need coffee for that little coffeemate thing in the bathroom. You using yours?" A pause, looks at the old (very smelly) man "You know kids?"  Compton closes one eye and peers at the partched Tranny from the other, "Taint funny man." he says. The to Tiziano, "Well, do ya?"  Tiziano blinks a few times before rubbing his eyes, "Do I what?" he looks between both of you wrinkling his nose.. what is it that you want?"  Penny jerks her thumb that-a-way, indicating where most bathrooms are in the rooms here "The coffee, the *coffee* we want the little coffee packets for the little coffee pot in the little coffee kit in the little bathroom set little boy. We came for the coffee. Do you have the coffee? If you don't have the coffee we will seek the coffee elsewhere." (**Note: 1 word, used 9 times in 1 pose**)  Compton says "Coffee." one more time for good measure.  Penny sighs to Compton and asides "This is beginning to feel like work. I'm coming down."  Tiziano frowns looking over towards Penny his hands being placed on his hips looking rather cross, "I am not a little boy." the high pitched voice states, "I'm 13.." he trails off, "Did you put the stuff in the punch there?"  "No." Compton says flatly, a little too quickly, "Want a bagle?"  Tiziano tilts his head a little, "Okay.." he trails off, "Antigone took my punch before I could finish it." he sighs looking over to Penny, "I'm not sure there is coffee I don't drink any."  Compton looks to Penny, "That sounded like a yes to me." he says handing the bagle over. Did we mention that Compton smells like a dumpster? Long story, but he does.  Penny looks down her nose at Tiziano, glasses slipping a little bit further while Compton tries to interject "Listen, you're getting a life-lesson little boy. Right fucking now," the build-up to this next bit bracketed by a pregnant pause and some half-hearted finger-pointing "Don't *ever* waste good drugs on the non-paying."  "What do you mean? There's always coffee. Why're you stalling? Comp - why's he stalling.."  Tiziano takes the baggle sniffing at it a few moments seeing if it smells as it should be tossed out, "Stalling?" he bites his lips, "I bet you have whatever it was that was in the punch.. umm what was the name again." he scratches his head.  "Just go *in* there and get it." Compton points past Tiziano, in to the room, "He said yes already." he reasons with Penny. Then to Tiziano, "That's good advice kid."  Tiziano quickly shakes his head, "You can't go inside my room.." he trals off, "My father would be really upset." he sighs taking a bite of the bagel talking with a full mouth, "You really shouldn't just knock on people's rooms you know."  A moment later, a light sparks deep behind Comptons eyes, "Hey kid, your parents use their mini-bar at all?"  "It's better than just walking in." Compton points out. "At least this gives you a chance to get your pants on."  Penny is leading. Compton is distracting with the bagel and Penny is walking past the kid into that room that is not theirs to hunt down the instant coffee. This only works because Compton can follow, follow-up and fix their own minibar woes as well. "C'mon, it'll just take a sec."  Tiziano turns a little red stepping behind the door, "I'm wearing shorts and I was asleep so there.. and well I I don't know.." he falls silent staring at you now the bagel forgotten.  Tiziano blinks, "Hey get out of there." he stomps his goot on the ground, "Your starting to really upset me." he grits his teeth, "Get out of my room!" he screams this last part.  Compton pushes in behind Penny, "Common kid. You said yourself you're not using it when she asked, that's the same as saying yes. You can't play with us like that... she really needs her coffee."  There's rummaging going on in the bathroom, the door half-open. These people, whoever they are, work FAST. Steamroller, baby. "Hey, you got a *showercap* Wooow. That's cool. Hey C - they got any gin left? We're gonna need it - and that shitty rum, too." She reappears, three coffee bags in her corner, when the tantrum starts "Comp - give the kid some money, hey? Bagels don't work like they used to."  Tiziano growls muttering something into Italian for a few moments looking more and more angered, "Vost grab my father's blade I'm tired of being nice." he turns towards Compton giving him a dark look, "You take one step toward me and you will die before the hour passess."  Compton puts his little 'tisket' basket down by the door and shoves a hand in to hispocket, comming out with a $5 bill. "Here kid. That's fair." He insists as he heads for the mini-fridge by the TV.  That stops Compton in his tracks. Damn. Somthing about someone half his size dropping a treat like that makes one take pause and consider it, and current circumstances a little more closely. "Hey. S'cool." the old hipster assures.  You say, "Just borrowin the freebies the hotel gives up, like you said we could."  Penny stops there, a few feet from Tiziano and kinda stares "Uu..uu.uhm. Kid listen, we're uh.. we're gonna GO. Now, okay?" Edges that way, to the far wall giving Compton a 'what the fuck' look.  Tiziano looks over towards the man, "I told you to depart.." his words drip of venom as he makes his way though the room over towards his bed he coups down as if picking something up, "No.. your going to stay.. I'm not a KID!" he screams, "I've tried being nice.. ooooh but you don't want that. You want the darkness well now your going to deal with it."  Compton gives the old eye-motion-to-the-door and a short nod, "Yeah, hey. No worries buddy. Thanks for helpin us out." and does the ole backwards march to the door, stooping to pick up the basket on his way by.  You say, "You really should use that peep hole." Compton adds in way of friendly advice still inching towards the door."  Tiziano takes a deep breath, "Oh.... now I think I am really mad." he grows silent for a moment looking towards the Bagel for a moment before tossing it towards Compton, "Catch."  That quick grab motion also pertains to Penny. Compton grabs her by the seat of her pants a little too hard. She drops the coffee packets and whines about it on the way out. "Hey, what's the big deal? It's just coffee..."  Penny stumbles backwards and catches the bagel in the eye "Ow, shit! Hey! Fuck, that fucking little ..what the fuck, Comp?"  Compton, not graced with youth, small nimble hands or any degree of dexterity, does his best with the lobbed bagel, and...  //.etro: Compton rolls "athletics+dexterity" at diff 6          For a botch!  ...not only misses the bagel completely, drops his basket and himself in the door way.  >  //.etro: Penny rolls "athletics+dexterity" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Nimble, young and a little rocked. That's what you have to be to get it done and get it done right. Penny is all that and a gymnast, too. She not only manages to get her balance back, but she tumbles backward and catches that fucking bagel on its way down. That was amazing.  It's not nice, but she pegs that hockey puck back into the room "Keep your fucking coffee."  Vost has arrived. Tiziano drops Vost.  Vost(#6152VXpC) See +flook  "Fucking hell." he comments to himself. Looking around behind himself for Penny. (OOC> Tiziano says "You guys brought in to the whole happy friendly Changeling bs. Its not true. It's a very dark game depending on what Lecagy your char is on. Mine is on his dark one. You barged into his room, you didn't leave when he asked you to, and he had his servent draw a very dangerous weapon. He is POed. Right now he can't even be directly attacked by Fae. (not sure about non-enchanted.) That is why I offered the retcon. I don't have humanity my char isn't human."  (OOC> Penny is just asking - we left when you threatened us and you're still attacking. (OOC> Compton never assumed nothing about Changeling. Please don't assume on my assumptions. It never crossed my path before. I'm just trying to learn how this is happening, that that it can happen. (OOC> Tiziano says "Well actully I was just attacking you at first. Compton kept calling me a kid so I tossed him in just before you left. Vost was about to smack you with his sword and inact is enchantment rede so you could see him. Quite frankly he could have walked behind you for 10 yards then smacked and killed you when you went to sleep." //.etro: Mercutio will be joining your location. Mercutio has arrived. (OOC> Mercutio says "Okay. What's up? :-)" (OOC> Tiziano says "Vost is about to attack Penny who is in the Hall." (OOC> Compton says "Oh, you know. Petty home invasion. A little enchanting with a bagel of doom and an invisible killer thingy going after the would-be invaders." (OOC> Mercutio says "Ah. I can't run this. :-(" (OOC> Tiziano ohs. :( (OOC> Compton says "Do we have a sub, or do we find an alternative?" (OOC> Mercutio says "Sorry. Hope you find someone soon." Mercutio goes home. Mercutio has left. (OOC> Compton finds the odds of that unlikely. (OOC> Compton twiddles. //.etro: Mercutio will be joining your location. Mercutio has arrived. (OOC> Tiziano waves. (OOC> Compton awakes. (OOC> Mercutio says "Okay, I need someone to +mail me a recap." (OOC> Penny okays. (OOC> Mercutio waits for it before he does anything else. (OOC> Tiziano says "There you go." (OOC> Mercutio says "Cool. Got it from two angles." (OOC> Mercutio says "Penny.. I was actually looking for a cut & paste of the poses, but okay." (OOC> Penny says "Oh. I can do that, too :)" (OOC> Tiziano has the log he can mail now. (OOC> Mercutio says "Yeah, please do." (OOC> Tiziano says "Give me your e-mail addy." (OOC> Mercutio says "If you need to, email it. mercutio-metro@sbcglobal.net" (OOC> Mercutio isn't gonna wait much longer, guys. (OOC> Compton hangs in. (OOC> Tiziano says "Do you want the ooc stuff ater the scene?" (OOC> Mercutio says "I want everything. I want un-edited logs." (OOC> Mercutio says "Well, you can edit out personal, unrelated pages, of course." (OOC> Tiziano says "That's gone. Now there is just personal talk and OOC talk till you came." (OOC> Tiziano says "I.E them asking me what I had done." (OOC> Penny sends it. (OOC> Mercutio doesn't have the logs yet. (OOC> Tiziano says "Okay I have everything up to where you showed up 1st time want things after that?" (OOC> Mercutio says "Yeah." (OOC> Tiziano says "Stop after you came back 2nd time?" (OOC> Mercutio says "Yeah." Mercutio slips into his Robes of Office and into Judge Mode! (OOC> Tiziano says "Okay you have my copy as well now. 7 pages." (OOC> Tiziano says "11 pages rather." (OOC> Tiziano says "Well it has been sent." (OOC> Mercutio just blinks. (OOC> Tiziano shocked Merc wth all his typos and bad spelling. (OOC> Penny doesn't think Merc scares so easy. (OOC> Tiziano has made a lot of typos in his ooc coments, "No spell check for OOC." (OOC> Mercutio says "Okay, by the logs I see that Penny was never actually Enchanted." (OOC> Mercutio says "So, I reset appropriate Glamour and removed the enchantment notes from Penny." (OOC> Mercutio says "Compton and Penny have already made it out into the hallway." (OOC> Mercutio says "Tiziano are still in the room." (OOC> Mercutio says "Is. Tiziano is. Sheesh." (OOC> Tiziano says "Okay Vost is using Fate's End spending 4 points of Glamour." (OOC> Mercutio says "Wait a moment." (OOC> Mercutio says "I'm not done looking over the logs." (OOC> Tiziano says "Also I would like to know how you ruled Penny was not properly enchanted." (OOC> Mercutio says "Uh, she didn't accept the bagel. You threw it at her." (OOC> Mercutio says "And then she promptly tosses it back at you." (OOC> Tiziano says "No I tossed it to Compton. She caught it beacuse she wanted to." (OOC> Penny says "It hit me in the eye." (OOC> Tiziano says "She took the Bagel of her own will it was not tossed at her." (OOC> Mercutio says "You tossed it. It hit her on the way. She caught it by reflex. Then threw it (OOC> Compton tired to catch it. Honestly botched. (OOC> Mercutio says "Catching it by free-will and accepting it are two different things." (OOC> Tiziano says "Catching it by free will is accepting it." (OOC> Mercutio says "Someone throws a baseball at me when I'm unprepared, I'm likely to catch it so that it doesn't hurt me. Free will. However, it doesn't mean I accepted it. It just means I didn't want to get hurt when it hit me." (OOC> Mercutio says "Plus, she has to EAT it or keep it on her person anyway. She tossed it back right away." (OOC> Mercutio says "Therefore, she is not enchanted." (OOC> Tiziano says "The moment she caught it she was enchanted. Either way Vost is taking that course of action then." (OOC> Mercutio says "No. Incorrect." (OOC> Mercutio says "She held it for a fraction of a second." (OOC> Tiziano says "So Vost will enchant her himself." (OOC> Mercutio says "Not long enough for Vost to react. And besides, she /was not enchanted./" OOC> Tiziano says "Vost doesn't need her to be enchanted to enchant her." OOC> Mercutio says "Right. Anyway, they're out in the hallway, you and Vost are in the room." OOC> Tiziano says "Vost can enchant her all on her on. He can use the encantment rede or he can hit her with the sword." OOC> Tiziano says "Yep and Vost is blowing 4 glamour to activate the power of Fate's end." OOC> Mercutio says "Which power?" OOC> Tiziano says "The rage like affect which allows him one action for each point he has in dexterity. That's 4 actions." OOC> Mercutio says "Ah. Okay.

OOC> Mercutio says "Penny and Compton first." Penny pages Mercutio and Compton: I'll be picking Compton up off his ass and using Mind to scan the boy, anticipate more flying things come at us. At least I'll try to. Mercutio pages Penny and Compton: How well do you know this boy, Compton? Penny pages: You know what you know from me-he isn't okay. He's severely fucked up. Mercutio pages: Have you had any decent talks with him? Do you know his name? Does he know yours? You paged (blind) Mercutio and Penny with 'Had a long conversation in Allan Gardens once. I know his name, he knows my name as Comp.'. Mercutio pages: Okay. Penny pages Mercutio and Compton: He doesn't know my name. I don't know his. I read his aura though and basically have him figured out. OOC> Mercutio says "Okay, Vost?" OOC> Mercutio says "Vost's turn is out of the way. Tiz? Your turn." ***Timestop dissolves*** Vost has left. Tiziano takes Vost. OOC> Mercutio says "Penny, Compton, beat it." OOC> Mercutio says "He let's you go." OOC> Mercutio says "If you want to pose that, Tiz, do so." OOC> Tiziano waves. OOC> Compton says "Alright." Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment. OOC> Compton hangs for any poses. OOC> Mercutio says "Err.. waitwait.." Penny leaves an apartment. Penny has arrived. OOC> Penny says "er.. did you mean literally or what.." OOC> Penny grins. OOC> Mercutio says "Let him pose, if he wants. Then you can leave, IC."  Tiziano is on the verge of ordering the strike. He seems to think better of it falling into a deep depression instead. The anger fades away from his eyes falling on the offering basket Compton dropped on his way out. The offering seems to apease the boy.  Penny makes with the oofs and the groaning alongside the most creative use of expletices in the latin language anyone's ever heard of. If they speak the language, that is. Not as heavy on her feet, Penny moves around Compton, glaring "Aren't you supposed to be taking care of me? Hellooo.. mcfly.." she actually makes another huffing noise getting Compton to his feet. expletives, too.  Compton scambles up to his feet, using Penny as leverage, "Geezus girl. Make tracks" he orders, at the time the best he can do towards fulfilling his role as Sunday.  Penny knocks on the door marked #174. Penny shouts, "Bitches, let us the fuck in, we lost our keys." Penny bangs on the door really loudly. Like end-of-the-world loud. It's the only way to wake up the occupants.    Mercutio goes now. Mercutio goes home. Mercutio has left.  Tiziano does make his way over towards the Hotel phone. Someone does have to pay for the minibar drinks and it isn't comming out of his butt.  Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment.  Compton hauls his mass up the hall catching up with Penny, turning to look back at the room they came from. He says in huffed breaths "What. Thefuck. Was. That?"  Jesse leaves an apartment. Jesse has arrived.  Penny leaves an apartment. Penny has arrived.  Tiziano is actully in room159 though the door is wide open. //.etro: Mercutio will be joining your location. Mercutio has arrived. Guard wanders down the hallway.  Tiziano is really in his room sitting on his bed on the hotel phone.  Compton looks at Jesse, his face flushed, and he well, stinks. Like a dumpster. Long story.  Jesse emerges headfirst from the room, responding to the apocalyptic knocks with insctinct-borne alacrity. Topless, his gaunt form is a writhing mess of tattoos. Sleep is rapidly being blinked from his eyes and, even barefoot and beltless, he has his satchel clutched in one hand.  Guard continues meandering on down the hallway. He notices the people collected outside of one of the rooms.  Penny looks over her shoulder, squinting down the hallway. Not for long, though. "Not that kind of emergency," dismissing Jesse's bag "No keys, man. It's cool, baby, it's cool. I need some sleep."  Compton clutched Jesse by the shoulder and turns his dazed form back towards the room. "Go t'bed man." he offers.  Jesse has his baseball cap on. Strange but true. No shirt, no shoes, just jeans and a baseball cap. A satchel and lots of tattoos. He slumps in the doorframe, sighing, then kicks the door open with the heel of his foot and motions 'after you'. "Crazy new invention I'll have to show you one of these days. Called a fucking telephone. Lets you wake me up without banging like it's the end of the world. What will they think of next?"  "Hey!" ejactulates the fat, old guard. "You guys need to be quieter, eh? What's all this ruckus aboot?"  Penny waves to the fat guy "Lost my keys," she say, separating her words with uncalled for annunciation and ducks into their room "sorry for the noise, sir. G'night." Nevermind that it's morning. pose.  Compton tunrs and looks at the old guard, lets go of Jesse's arm and raises his in a classic, 'huh?' pose.  Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment.  "Sorry, sir, sorry." Brim pulled low over his face, the barechested wastrel waves to the guard. "Won't happen again." He ducks into the apartment.  Guard says, "Uh, hey, excuse me, eh? I'm not done talking with you folks."  Compton just stands there looking blank and airy, "Huh?" he asks this time. If it wasn't mentioned before, he stinks. Dumpster like.  Guard points over to another room, one with the door still open. "You break into that there room and steal something from it, eh?"  Jesse shakes his head no, grabs Compton, and pulls him roomward. "In the shower. What did you, find some stink you liked and roll in it?" Jesse looks down the hallway at the open door and shrugs. "I was sleeping. But why, there something missing?"  "Sorry sir, I don't know what you're talking about. I was just dropping off the lady." Compton says pointing to room 172 as if to illustrate.  Guard nods, putting one hand on his belt and the other over his collapsible baton. "Why, someone in that there room claims you pushed past him and stole stuff from the mini-bar."  Compton stares blankly at the guard again. Scared? Clueless? It's hard to tell. He opens his mouth once, but closes it again... a little goldfish like.  "Uh. I didn't do anything but wake up and let my friend back in her room." Jesse bares a wide yawn, utterly unflapped. Nothing to worry about, this misunderstanding could not be more trivial. "You sure it's them as did it?" He turns to Compton. "Did you barge in somewhere? Steal something?"  Guard just nods. "Kid described them. Said one of 'em smelled like trash, eh. This guy here, he smells aboot like trash."  Compton blinks! looking dumbfoundedly at Jesse, "Wha?" then back at the guard, "L-like I said, I was just leavin eh? Just got here too, now I'm just leaving. Shower time. At home. Far from here." Okay, he's kind of stammering.  Compton mutters to Jesse, "... the... stop... I'm... here." You whisper "Go the fuck back inside and stop talking to me. I'm SOnny, and I'm outta here." to Jesse.  "Kid?" Jesse laughs, shaking his head. "Oh, I get it. Kid hears all this, hears us being loud, figures it's a good time to raid the minibar." He waves to the Guard, extricating himself from the doorframe. "Check under the mattress. Kids always think you'll never look there."  Jesse has left. Jesse enters an apartment.  Guard frowns. "If I go into the other room and find it trashed, then don't find anything, you will allow me to search you and your room, eh?"  Compton stops and thinks about this for a second, his brow krikling up, "I,um... I mean, like, its no my room eh?" he says in his defense.  "Right." The Guard leans in close... but not too close - god that smell is bad. He gets a narrow-eyed, evil-as-he-can-try-to-be look in his eyes, "I better not hear anything else from you, ya hear?"  Tiziano is on th phone asking questions such as will is dad be have to be told of this disturbence and can everything be done quietly. More then liky he is told his father shall be told. To which he will ask why.  "Sir, yes sir. sir" The old hipster agrees, too readily realizing he's off the hook. "Good day to ya to eh?"  "Oh, and I don't normally smell like this... Long story." Compton adds, trying to salvage his dignity a little.  Guard says, "Right. Anyway, go get clean. You smell terrible." Guard wanders off.  Compton looks like he's going to explain, but decides to just get lost.  You push through the glass doors and leave the Holiday Inn. Downtown - Spadina and King W(#257RJ)       This is the central bar area of Toronto. There is a bar on every corner, and from Thursday to Saturday it is next to impossible to find parking. The line-ups get huge and the hot dog venders get wealthy. On the northwest corner stands the neon monument called Whiskey Saigon, and near by are other bars such as Dirk Gently's and Power Bar. The Coloured Stone is located kitty-corner to Whiskey, a trendy bar and pool hall. Restaurants are also common in this area, everything from a bar and grill, to the finer dining experiences. Things are relatively more quiet other nights, but there is always traffic. The sidewalks are a clean white colour and the streets have been repaved, to the delight of motorists driving through the city. Even the planters with the flowers and the trees make this section a brighter place.  You enter the lobby area of the Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn(#2848RnAJ)       This spacious lobby area has many comfortable seats and a fire place. It is very clean, except for the clutter of baggages placed on the floor by the people checking in or out. Loads of magazines are organized on a centrally located coffee table. The front desk has a couple of employees signing in guests. A gift shop entrance is located right next to the front desk area, displaying all sorts of Ontario and Canada goodies for the passing tourist to purchase. A large area opens up through a passage way on the far side of the lobby and the faint scent of chlorine drfits in from a heated pool out of sight.  Contents: Room176(#4941ed) Room174(#4497ed) Room172(#4869ed) Room170(#5048ed) Room169(#5091ed) Room167(#5822ed) Room166(#5258ed) Room165(#7658ed) Room164(#6674ed) Room159(#6092ed) Room158(#7027ed) Room157(#5983ed) Room156(#7909ed) Room154(#6976ed) Room152(#5498ed) Room150(#5751ed) Room139(#2747ed) Front Desk Obvious exits: Out     room174 You enter the apartment. Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Jesse Penny  Compton slips back in, all quiet and rather un-Compton like.  Jesse is lying on a sleeping bag on the floor, one hand tucked behind his head, the other dealing with a lit cigarette. "Oi. Rock. The fuck happened? Penn just wigged and I scripted a xanax and a vicodin. You freaked too?"  Penny says, "Nn.. " she wants, sensing Compton's arrival "..water."  "Anyway I don't think it's just you. Eva's awol. I think she and I had about the same level of reservations about coming here only she stuck to hers. And what happened to the comsys? I thought that was functioning back when we were living on Fresno-time. Gah.. I keep getting this feeling like we've been deserted, yeah? Like the sane, the rational have parted company."  Without saying anything, he goes to the bathroom, pulls the garbach bag from the can before taking his stinking shirt off and bagging it. The pants are soon to follow. So now we have a big almost naked guy who's still wiffy standing there, looking at Jesse, "Beats me... go in to your satchel and get me those mini-bottles I stashed there. I need a fucking drink." before turning back to the bathroom. Shortly the sound of a running shower can be heard.  Jesse laughs, and leaves the cigarette in his mouth long enough to snag the strap of his satchel and sling it skidding across the carpet to gently thud against the bathroom door. "Who was the kid?"  From beyond the bathroom door, a Comptons voice calls through, "Some kid that bugged me when I was golfing at the gardens. Said his name was Fagiano, or DizzyCamo or somthing like that... Wop name. Ms. Congeneality out there wanted some coffee."  "Do we need to give him a free spin?" Jesse has the oddest euphemisms for killing people. Honestly, now. He yawns widely. "Did you get the coffee at least?"  "Fucked if I know." comes from the bathroom.  From the bed, Penny makes drifting noises "He needs to pass go a few more times. /Whiney/ little fuck. I looked," she means she Looked "at him and if there ever was a kid that needed to be on lithium.. shit that kid's it. And parental supervision. Who leaves their kid alone in a place like this? God. Television is the replacement parenting unit."  "Fuck off, Penny." Jesse calls from the floor, without malice. "Some of us wish we'd been raised by televisions."   "No," totally buzzkilled "we didn't get the fucking coffee."  "Yeah. I know. And I'm saying it was a shitty fucking childhood, okay? I can't love a tv, Jes. And the tv doesn't love me. It's an empty vessel."  Compton exits the bathroom, wrapped in Pennys kimono, and a towel wrapped around his head. "MInd telling me now, what the fuck that whole surreal deal was about?" he asks. His voice is tired. Dry. He was fighting off a stupor before whatever happened, happened. Now he's lost that struggle and has gone in to wrecked buick stage. He sits on the end of his bed, and cranks the seal in a mini-bottle of Smirnoff.  "Television's better'n some alternatives, is all I'm saying." Jesse grunts his agreement when Compton re-emerges. "Yeah. The fuck did happen?"  Compton drains the tiny bottle, and tosses it at the can, missing by about two feet. Next a bottle of Southern Comfort is offered up.  Penny can't get out of this moment. Re-telling is like re-living and the more she says it, the real-er it becomes. Groudhog's Day. "Kid said he knew Compton. So they're talking, right?" New drugs making her slow, cohesive and solid "and I get the filter packs from the bathroom while they're talkin'lsd and some shit and when I come back? something's totally wrong." She yawns and sits up "Give it here," hand extended to palm the SoCo, takes a little and stretches. "He's saying we're making him angry. I'swe-ah - angry. Like the fucking Hulk would say it, y'know? That was some David Banner shit. So I read the kid and it's like he's.." trails off, pondering "..more. More than a kid."  Compton takes back the remainder of the bottlette, and drains it. He listens, about intently as Jesse, for although he was ther, he saw all the actors, he still has no idea what the plot was. Next bottle: Beefeaters. Mmmm, piney goodness.  Penny sheds the jacket, the glasses, her socks. That belt. The earring. All these accoutrement. Unecessary in the crunch or crux of conversation "He's just a kid, right?" questioning Compton "He's just a kid but there was something else. It was like looking at tree and when the lights snapped on, the whole root-structure shows up in x-ray. The whole answer. The big picture. The entire theme to this kid's life was right there and he wasn't a kid!"  Compton finished the last of the gin, and sighs, looking at the empty, tosses it at the can, and misses, but puts it right next to the empty vodka on the floor. "Bed time" he states simply, and stands, walking over to the window side of the far bed. Then he drops Pennys poor kimono, and for a moment you're all exposed to the full horror that is the 'Full Compy' before he climbs under the covers, "Or it's the drugs, Penny." he says with dying interest, "Or he's a fucking demon. Either way I'm fine, you're fine. Next time we just leave kids alone. Right?"  She whimpers; out of fear or concedeing the point - isn't clear. "I'm sorry man, it was the drugs. I really thought I needed that coffee. But I know what I saw."  "Bitch, put some pants on."   That comment or any other, no matter how sound or based in self-preservation is lost on the old guy, as a soft drone of snoring comes from the far side of the room. Well, at least he don't stink no more.  ***And so the longest, most pointless scene finally ends at 5am EST. Kudos the Merc forbeing apillar of reason and calmness.

       Room  Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Penny Compton Keene  There is a knock on the door. Slight, low down and quiet. But rapid and repeating repeating. Like a tiny little Anne Frank motherfucker tapping to be let out of hiding.  "I'm not getting that," says Keene, working at the desk on his laptop on some seedy press release about the upcoming boy band concert.  Penny always forgets to call 'not it.' Penny gets up from her comfy place on the floor. Always when she's got a good ground & focus going on. "Coming," her voice gravel rolling under water. Not a big room but it takes her a few to get to the door. Long night, rough night. "'whoz'it?"  The knocking stops. There is a pause. Then a slight scratchy noise. Something slides under the door. Looks like the top of a cigarette packet. Yup. The lid of a box of Lucky Strikes, all written on. The tap tap tapping continues. Long short, short long long, short long short long. Morse code?  Penny kicks the lid back under the door "Knock it off, who is it?"  The knocking stops again, and there's another faint noise of motion. Then silence. Footsteps. Closer and closer. Then a real knock on the door. At man-knocking height.  "For fuck's sake," Keene says, pausing to save his work and close his laptop. He turns to look towards the door. "Just see who it is already. If it's a Paradox spirit, they don't like to be kept waiting anyway."  Penny half to the door, half to Keene "You expecting anyone?" waiting on Keene's response before she'll address the door again. "Fine..okay. But if it has a mouth, I'm slapping it."  Penny, of course, opens the door.  A man stands there, one of the hotel's security staff. Just to the side of him is a rather ubiquitous cardboard box. He gestures down at it with a flourishing motion of the hand. "Is this yours? We'd appreciate it if you diddn't leave your belongings out in the hallway for others to trip over them."  Keene puts his hand over his face, fingers splayed, meat of his palm resting on the tip of his nose. "Why, God, why," is his only comment before he brings his hand down, gets up, and walks out to look at the box. "Yeah, that's probably ours. We'll move it right away. Sorry to trouble you." He taps the side of the box with his foot to see if Pobble is still inside of it.  The box seems to be full of something. Not as heavy as a person however. Somewhere a quiet voice says, "About fucking time you wanker.".  The guard looks to the side, squinting back at the two of you. "Did you say something?"  "TV's on," comments Keene, without missing a beat. "You like Red Dwarf? It's one of those wonderfully charming British comedy series." He gives the guard one of those winning smiles that has a strange, reassuring quality. "We'll be sure to keep the noise down. Sorry again for the inconvenience." He begins edging the box towards the door with the side of his shoe, assuming Penny takes over the process of dragging the box in once it's fully in front of the door.  Offended and hungover, Penny gets a good glare on the guard "You g.." sputtering quietly as Keene steps in. It's his fault, really. He should've gotten the door. Penny stands aside, holding the door open "No, sir. Thanks for keepin'an eye out for us, hey?" Her hands twitching, she tucks something that might be money into his front-pocket.   Just out of hearing of the guard, the voice says, 'Fucking nark.' and coughs quietly then returns to silence. Then coughs again. Smoke splutters from the room-side hole in the box to accompany the bhroncial issues.  Keene gets the box in front of the door, then starts to push it into the hotel room with his heel -- keeping an eye on the guard the whole time. He is the last thing the guard will see, hopefully, before Keene closes the door behind him. "Penny," he says, still looking at the guard, "help with the box, won't you? Put it over behind the door there when I close it, that's good." And hopefully Keene gets the box inside the room and closes the door up behind him.  "Alright.." says the guard suspciously. He obviously doesn't get paid enough to give a shit about whatever seems to be going on here and turns and heads along on his rounds.  Penny has a kind of maniacal look to her, closing the door. Reminiscent of Anthony Hopkins in Psycho - moving with that careful, methodical ease of someone that knows just what she's going to do next. And then after that, too. She'll help. She kicks the box that way to the corner of the room. Something in her eyes begins to settle south in her clenched jaw. Hazard sign. Warning. Danger. A vein starts to pulse clearly from her left temple.  Keene closes the door, locks it up securely, then turns to watch the box fly across the room. He works a cigarette out of his breast pocket, puts it between his lips, and lights it with his Masonic Zippo as the carnage invariably begins. "See, that's the thing," he says. "I deal with enough *human* stupidity that protecting Familiars from the fallout of their actions just doesn't fit the bill. Excuse me."  At that, Keene walks into the bathroom, closes the door, and locks it for the duration.  "What the fuck.." comes the startled reply from the box, followed by "Ow, fucking ow." and "Argh, shit." and "You cunt." until the flap opens and a monkey clambers out, throwing a cigar before him and rolling about on the carpet trying to extinguish the arm of his rather shiny looking suit before the fur catches fire. The box seems untouched by the fire. The cigar smoulders on the Holiday Inn carpet, while the monkey rolls.. revealing that his back is marked with a peice of burnt and melted plastic and some kind of blue powder, which has melted onto the suit in places.  Counting down from ten, she paces toward the closet where they keep their things. He'll come out of the box sooner or later, Penny is sure. Penny can wait. Penny has been waiting for a long time.  Rummaging through Jesse's things, she turns on the scorched monkey and flips open, of all things, a switchblade. "Dave," she coos, like Hal "I'm going to skin you, Dave."  The *snikt* sound of the knife opening up may or may not be in Dave's audible range but she's confident he can feel her intent. "And then I'm going to give it to the sylph on the other side of the bathroom mirror. And she's going to possess you. We cut a deal, her'n me. She's going to be the air you breathe."  The monkey freezes. Those with good hearing or lip reading (Monkey Spec) could possibly garner the words 'Oh Shit' from the vulgar potty mouth creature. Staring at the girl, his eyes shift to the slightly overturned box and he darts sideways with The Agility of the Monkey. One hand snapping out a lighter, the other pulls the half open bag of bright blue powder from the box. Dave settles arm behind him, as if the powder bag were a sling, lighter held in the other hand.   The cigar still smoulders. Right on the Holiday Inn carpet.  "Flour mills are dangerous places.." says the cockney edgit.  Penny? is CRAZY. Bug.fuck. Lost it. Completely off her rocker. But she's so calm, a center, an eye around which things orbit. In her other hand is a pillowcase full of something "Do you *understand me*?" She pitches the fabric at Dave, interrupting the dusting and follows with a particularly clumsy thrust of the knife.  On the far bed, where Compton has pretty much claimed as his own, lie the man himself. fully dressed except for nekkid feet. His chast and gut rise and fall in steady rythm. A deep droning snore resonates from the man, as does a faint tinge of diesel fuel.  The monkey jumps forward under the flung pillow, and with a look of terrible sadness in its blue blue eyes it flings the big bag o blue barney powder at the woman. Meanwhile, the pillow lands on the smoking/nearly burning carpet/cigar combo, taking it out of sight. The already burnt open bag splits midair, showering the woman with blue cocaine and creating a veritable powder bomb. Almost on cue, the pillow bursts into flames. And the monkey goes diving for the bed.  That's probably true. It's a well established fact since he slept through that quake in 2006, Compton could sleep through anything. Even a fight.  Aggrivated and irritated, Penny goes low when the monkey goes high for the bed, the edge of her robe not singed, shaking off the coke. She yanks out a plastic bag and unloads what at first appears to be lengths of rope. The more she grabs, though, it becomes evident that it's hair. Dreads. A whole head full "I'm going to SUFFOCATE you, monkey!"  Mean but effective, she gets across what she means to do.  A blue haze fills the air, that bag was pretty fat. Probably the lifetime gross earnings of some little African chap. Floating down through the air. It fizzles and pops as it comes in contact with the burning pillow. The foam has a pungent odour to it and thick black smoke seeps out of it.. drifting up towards the smoke alarm. The monkey struggles amidst the hair, its little monkey nails scratching visciously at its opponent. The fizzling of cocaine and pillow fabric continues as the dust settles.. down, condensing as it moves towards the floor.  A brief second later, there is a big badaboom.  Penny keeps piling the hair at the monkey, choking him. Basically she's done with the dialogue part of the evening. Her reasons, many and varied as they may be, all boil down to the fetid stink of vengence.   The floor is on fire but Keene, we're sure, is very handy with the ice bucket and the making damp of things on fire. She gets one hand free and delivers a punch to his little monkey mouth. Nobody should treat monkeys like that; it's inhumane. Wait'll PETA hears about this one.  The floor burns with the fire of Penny's love for Dave. Sticky black muck is clumped about, in hair and on sleeping faces. One can only hope that the noise will draw Keene from his extended sitting, unless he's fallen down the hole..  The Monkey falls unconscious without a further sound limp suited arms and legs hanging feebly. The smell in here is somewhat attrocious, acrid smoke everywhere. Fortunately it appears that someone turned off the smoke alarm..

      All that is left of the 032103 log is this:  Gideon pages: You and Jesse are gonna NOT hurt Mary, you are gonna check up on a Kraut, and a guy named Earl, who killed a guy named Collidge.  How sad. That was a good night of rp. Fuck. Sigh. Scene went something like:  Jesse's at Overdrive's Alley Penny meets up with him. They  have a drink while Barnabas tries to convince Jesse he's gay.  Penny shows off shaved head, scares off the rest of the rp.  Gideon shows up. Jesse goes 'hey'. Penny goes 'uh, you're kidding right'. They do a pimps up/hos down thing.   Twiddling around a table, they chatter about stuff; discuss money, background details, names and places. Penny & Jesse explain that they're professionals fronting for a sizable organization and go through bravado about it being boring to just collect information - they're big on "forgetting". Penny impresses Gideon with gun knowledge. Jesse impresses Gideon by being Jesse.  They part amicably and say something about two weeks, they'll be in touch.

      An odd scene for me, considering where it starts. We learn interesting things such as spaceships coming from beyond to eat all beings that get too close to it. The spirits are screaming in pain whenever we care to listen. Consider me near over-dosed for the rest of the weekend.  You walk west along Dundas to Jarvis. Downtown - Jarvis and Dundas(#131RJ)       Empty lots and undeveloped plots of useless land fill this intersection. Old, largely-abandoned factories are set up along the streetside. Development here ceased long ago, apparently. Two major homeless shelters operate in this area, given its rather cheap real-estate value. The area is mostly populated by homeless people, junkies and whores, though the occasional employee of the few operating companies in this area might be seen driving through... generally rapidly.

Overgrown with weeds, and dotted here and there with rubble from the detritus of years of neglect, and from what appears to be the remnants of a former building, there is almost a sad, forlorn feel to the place.      The entire lot apparently was once a fairly large building--perhaps a warehouse--because beneath the accumulating litter that the city never quite manages to entirely pick up, and the weeds springing up from every crevice, is  cracked and weathered cement. Broken bits of glass glitter in the dim light. An occasional syringe can be found, discarded by a careless junkie, and the nonsense scrawlings of graffiti artists--as well as the evidence of true artistic gift--is visible on every broken slab of concrete.           [[ OOC: This is a patrolled area. Security will find you. ]]           Obvious exits: Building Ruins [BR]  Street: Jarvis and Dundas [O]    +umscan      The Weaver is firmly in control here. Even that feeble plant-life that can survive the choke-hold of steel-reinforced cement slabbing is dying fast. Dark, nebulous mist creeps across the ground, seeming almost alive as it drifts across the vacant lot. Glowing eyes peer out of crevices, poisonous colors that speak of potential Wyrm-taint.       The air is dry and dusty, rasping at the throat, the wind whispering only of death and decay and the unmaking.  You head into the ruins of the building at the back of the lot. Building Ruins - Vacant Lot - Jarvis and Dundas       There's a roof here only by virtue of the fact that the floor for the  second storey is still mostly intact. Any interior finishing is long gone--the  concrete walls and floor are pitted and cratered, in fact, revealing the  remnants of wiring and the steel skeleton reinforcing the building shell.      Graffiti covers the walls, and the stale smell of urine is strong. Rats  occasionally can be heard rustling and squeaking among the litter and rubble  in the shadows. It's a grim, dreary place, this wreckage of a building, always  dim and lit only seldom by the occasional campfire.      Any interior walls that once existed are now long gone, and despite the  rubble and litter strewn about, it's still a spacious room. When the weather  is inclement, the wind whistles through narrow crannies and nooks in the walls  and ceiling, giving almost the impression that the building is alive and has a  presence of its own.  Obvious exits: Rickety Staircase [Up]  Vacant Lot [O]    +umscan      The lack of light here is both spiritual and physical, a heavy black sticky miasma that clings to any living thing that visits. Only the occasional dim light of a fire-spirit, dancing weakly and oh-so-futilely ever cuts through the gloom and reveals the litter-strewn expanse of a place forgotten by humanity and controlled by the Weaver.  Building Ruins - Second Story       Fractured walls painted flat black stand around you on all sides, all that is left of this level in a building almost completely destroyed by time and decay. The roof overhead is no more, only twisted-metal girders and the occasional patch of what was once the floor above block out the sky overhead. Barred windows let through the occasional burst of air, wafting up the tattered black curtains like Halloween ghosts on the wind -- no glass in their frames to stop the weather outside from pouring in. There is a sense of darkness here no matter what the time of day is, shadows cast in all corners but given no form by the black paint which surrounds on all sides.      Someone has made a 'den' of this place, bringing in all sorts of elements to help bring comfort to those that visit. Black, wooden crates are set about for chairs and stools; old cushions which still hold their form and haven't begun to fall apart give a place to rest that is not cold concrete; two large barrels burn refuse to flame and warm the area from the weather outside; and incense of sandalwood and clove burn from all corners of the room to create a soft cloud of gentle smell.       On one wall, where light never touchs, a crescent moon is painted in white. Below it on the floor burn candles of black and white color in jars.  Obvious exits: Rickety Staircase [O]    +umscan      The lack of light here is both spiritual and physical, a heavy black sticky miasma that clings to any living thing that visits. Only the occasional dim light of a fire-spirit, dancing weakly and oh-so-futilely ever cuts through the gloom and reveals the litter-strewn expanse of a place forgotten by humanity and controlled by the Weaver.       Once in a great while, the black presence thins enough to view stars high above, reminding the soul that there is always some light to be had.   You head down the rickety stairs, stepping wide to avoid the missing steps, and arrive at street-level.  You head out of the ruined building, to the vacant lot. Vacant Lot - Jarvis and Dundas   You thread your way in and among and around piles of rubble and leave the  vacant lot for the street. Downtown - Jarvis and Dundas(#131RJ)  You walk north along Spadina to King.  Downtown - Spadina and King W(#257RJ)       This is the central bar area of Toronto. There is a bar on every corner,  and from Thursday to Saturday it is next to impossible to find parking. The  line-ups get huge and the hot dog venders get wealthy. On the northwest corner  stands the neon monument called Whiskey Saigon, and near by are other bars  such as Dirk Gently's and Power Bar. The Coloured Stone is located  kitty-corner to Whiskey, a trendy bar and pool hall. Restaurants are also  common in this area, everything from a bar and grill, to the finer dining  experiences. Things are relatively more quiet other nights, but there is  always traffic. The sidewalks are a clean white colour and the streets have  been repaved, to the delight of motorists driving through the city. Even the  planters with the flowers and the trees make this section a brighter place.

Those of you who are outside and can see into  one of the three umbras, you see the star of light growing bigger and bigger  as it nears the city. It is not falling, however, more like approaching.

Escalus pages: The humming noise has stopped growing louder as the doppler  shift directs the sound upward rather than towards the city. Those of you who  can see outside can now see it for what it is. It is a space ship, as large as  a football field, bristling with antenna and resonating with power. The name  of the ship is written in billboard size letters across the side; ACTIUM.  Escalus pages: The ship has now reached the tallest skyscrapers of the city  and disappears among them. It is definitely headed toward downtown. The buzz  is beginning to be more muted, but still persistent.  Escalus pages: The humming noise has subsided so it can no longer be heard  unless you are near to the site where it landed.  Downtown - Jarvis and Dundas(#131RJ)       Empty lots and undeveloped plots of useless land fill this intersection.  Old, largely-abandoned factories are set up along the streetside. Development  here ceased long ago, apparently. Two major homeless shelters operate in this  area, given its rather cheap real-estate value. The area is mostly populated  by homeless people, junkies and whores, though the occasional employee of the  few operating companies in this area might be seen driving through...  generally rapidly.

For those people whose senses are grounded in the real world, there is nothing going on here, but a few people and a group of people inside the fenced-in area of the vacant lot.  [OOC] Someone says "We dead people are so desensitized. :p"  Mary shudders for one thing, and reaches out to put her hand against the  fence, as if she was pondering climbing it, too get a closer look at.. er..  whatever she's looking at, up there in the sky.  [OOC] Fey says "After everything that has happened here, we are a jaded bunch."  Catherine moves close towards the Vacant lot, listening closely. Again, she  smiles looking towards that familiar sound.  Finger in her ear, Penny jabs at something. Tiny wires in her ears. Earbuds. Wires join somewhere near her chest to a singular point then into a pocket. She moves not so quickly and carries on, business as usual past some homeless kids and toward another nexus of people.  Tom appears from the north. Tom has arrived.  Catherine remains quiet and somewhat in the background but she slowly goes closer towards the Vacant lot, touching the fence. Listening intensly, a soft smile on her lip..and then a giggle.  Mary's hand curls around the bit of the fence she's put her hand against. She  pauses a momeent, gathering herself, then starts trying to scramble upwards.  It's sort of funny to watch... because she ain't going anywhere. Not the best  climber, apparently.  Slunk low in his overcoat, Tom, it would seem, is out for a long, nonchalant  walk under the very nearly full moon. Shoes clap wetly along the moist  sidewalk. The mist hangs low and ponderous, very still, and it doesn't seem to  part at all for the likes of Tom. Just the remarkable humidity has already  moistened his hair. A nonchalant stroll, along the sidewalk, to think things  through - and that bit of thinking has led him here, how peculiar.  Shahai arrives from the west. Shahai has arrived.  Shahai drives up in a black Lexus, the windows tinted and the highbeams on.  Oh, and she's smoking. Or she was up until it went out just then. Penny pats  herself down, pocket to pocket and jacket to jeans. No dice, the fates must be  against her. She looks back over her shoulder at the homeless kids, weighing  the quick steps back for a light, wiping slick damp from the curve past her  ears. Another glance toward the people and the fence, sticking to her side of  the street.  Catherine walks along the fence to see if there is any opening or gate on it  from this way. She's not gonna climb it..though she probably would get over. Or maybe she -does- know how to climb. For Mary pauses again, regathering  herself, and jumps first this time, grabbing hold of the fence at the apex of  her leap, and scrambling upwards. It's ever so much more affective than it was  the first time around. She shimmies up, and drops over the edge.  Tom seems largely to be talking to himself, looking a little puzzled. Listening, perhaps, as well. All types out, tonight. Then, the characteristic sound of a fence shaking, metal on metal. With his brow furrowed, Tom glances up from the sidewalk... gaze wandering, drifting. Speaks to himself, sotto voce. Stops walking. Stands stock still on the damp sidewalk, eyes focusing on Mary as she scrabbles.  Mary You step off the street and into the vacant lot. Mary has left. [HOODOO] Penny (Monday) gods. Forget protecting Mary now.  Shahai pulls up to the front gate of the place and gets out. It looks like  someone has the key.  Long distance to Escalus: Penny heys. Do I get a result on that +roll? From afar, Escalus is confused. Escalus pages: Remind me, which roll? You paged Escalus with 'Spirit2/Mind2 - get spirits to talk to Penny.'. Escalus pages: I missed your seocnd roll. What did you get? You paged Escalus with '1 success.'.  Escalus pages: What you hear is /screaming/.  Shahai gets in and drive the car throught he open gate. Shahai You step off the street and into the vacant lot. Shahai has left.  Catherine does move closer to the gates. Maybe this is her chance to get in.  You paged Escalus with 'That's not good.'.  Catherine You step off the street and into the vacant lot. Catherine has left.  Escalus pages: The spirits are screaming in pain.  Tom steps off of the moist sidewalk and into the street. Only looking left  then right once he's standing on the pavement, Tom walks patiently across the  street, through the onrushing cars, up onto the sidewalk, over the fence,  which he peers through. Subvocalizes, rubbing his throat.  Tom paces to the fence. Looks through the metal twisted in rings over the  fence posts. Cranes his neck a little, to see what's going on. Then, he draws  away, stops his rubbernecking, and migrates off down the sidewalk, up the  street, arm up, arm out. The other hand fetches something, a PDF or something,  out of his coat. He occasionally taps things on the PDF, then, as punctuation,  waves his arm out again for a taxi.  A flex and release; that's the motion in her shoulders, throat and jaw.  Nicfit, Penny's habit must be worse than she let's on. She starts patting  herself down again, bordering on frantic, starts asking randomly passing  strangers "Light? Got a light?" resembling the unsettling homeless kids.   You paged Escalus with 'Three times a charm? I'd like to try one more time,  ask for the source.'.  From afar, Escalus nods. To me.  //.etro: Penny rolls "3" privately to Escalus at diff 5.          For a total of 2 success(es). [OOC] Someone says "Sorry. ].[ I'd meant to save that... pose order and all...  Hit enter too soon."  Catherine has come inside the thing, only to have a black-suited man with  sunglasses draw a gun on here.  Escalus pages: Did I answer you?  Penny gets relit by the nicest person in Canada. She just offers a Bic and a  sympathetic smile. Doesn't comment on Penny's outburst or her shaking hands  except for "Cold night, eh?" and lets Penny nod by way of conversation and moves on. Bright orange reappears at the end of her cigarette and she exhales  a great cloud of smoke and breath. Ashes roll down the front of her jacket as she repositions herself closer to the curb.  You paged Escalus with 'Nope.'.  [OOC] Penny realizes her wraithdesc might be wrong. Huh. [OOC] Penny fixes, sorries.  Escalus pages: Did I answer you? Announcement: Pericles shouts, "Anyone interested the broken commands at the  carnival have been fixed so you can pester me about them if you want to check  them out."  Escalus pages: The spirits are fleeing the area. It is like the big machine is  eating them. You paged Escalus with 'Can I take the second success away with me and get  some conversation time later on?'.  Escalus pages: Sure you can. You paged Escalus with 'Excellent. When you're not swamped, buzz me?'.  Catherine has arrived. Gwennyth has arrived. Mary has arrived.  Catherine does look back behind her and then towards Gwennyth as she's escorted out. She signs, then just lets her hands drop, shrugging.  Mary stumbles as she emerges from the lot, something having thrown her off balance on the way out. She looks somewhat shaken.. but mostly wonder-struck, for some reason.  Gwennyth follows Catherine and Mary out, watching them both intently. She has a backpack in her hand and says carefully, facing Catherine, "Please stay here."  Catherine says something in a language you don't understand.   For his part, Tom stands around in the mist, head down, face lit from below by the phosphorescent blue of his PDF. He watches something - possibly a video or some television - with a rapt expression. Gaze distant and unfocused, as though he was looking deep through the image... or perhaps deep into it.  Gwennyth watches Catherine a moment, but doesn't respond. Maybe she doesn't  know what the woman's saying. She motions for Mary to stand close to  Catherine so that she can easily watch both of them. HEr hands are clasped behind her back, holding the backpack.    Escalus says "Okay, guys. Rather than RP this out, I can have a normal  cop car come and pick you two up."  Mary steps over close to Catherine, and turns and looks up again, at the sky once more.. she ccan still see it out here, at least, though perhaps not as well. Of course, what 'it' is may be hard to determine.    Mary's fine with however is easiest for you to handle.   Escalus is severely running out of steam. They will take you to the station, give you tickets, and get your names and address and hten let you go.   Catherine says "Okay..."   Gwennyth says "Works good for me."   Escalus says "Okay, Mary and Catherine, the police will take you away.  Skedaddle."   Mary says "We clear to go home, or do we need to go hang at the cop  shop?"   Escalus says "Oh, no, jsut go home."   Mary says "Gotcha. Thank you, Esc. You rock." Mary hails a cab and departs. Mary has left. Escalus pages: Okay, I think I have time. What did you want to ask?   Catherine says "Thanx...bye." You paged Escalus with 'What the hell just happened and can it be repaired?'.  Once Mary and her backpack, and Catherine are safely in police custody, Gwennyth turns and heads back into the lot.  Long distance to Escalus: Penny doesn't mince words even with the ephemeral.  Catherine goes home. Catherine has left.  Escalus pages: This machine eats spirits. Anyone that gets too close. It is big and strong. You can repair it by destroying it.  Talking to herself, Penny crosses the street just ahead of the cops' arrival somewhere in Tom's vicinity. Smoke wreaths her wake in the thinnest parts of the air, fog roiling underfoot. She looks this way and that way, settling on the cab that Tom hailed "You taking that one?"  You paged Escalus with 'Who operates the machine?'. Escalus pages: I do not know. I cannot get close to it. You paged Escalus with 'Okie doke. Won't keep you. Thanks - this is great.'.

      Crazy Eight's - The Stoop(#6864RXnJ)       The stoop is a glass-fronted atrium with a wide view of the street and  sidewalk outside. There is a cigarette machine, a working pay phone and a  couple metal racks that hold the local free periodicals. They are the rags or  sheets that one can while away the time without the added cost of purchasing a  newspaper. White and black tile covers the floor in Roman meander line. Set  within the center of this design is an eight ball.                                --> NIGHTZONE   Contents: Alexander Obvious exits: Pool Hall [PH]  Front Door [O]  One look at the dark-haired, dark-eyed man, he can be as young as twenty, or  as old as thirty, one look and his seriousness becomes obvious. He has one of  those ageless faces that makes his age so hard to determine with just a look.  Most of the hair is shaved from his head, leaving only a couple of weeks  growth. He could be of Southern European birth, the tone of his skin being  slightly darker then that of most born Canadians. When he moves, it is with a  subtle feminine grace.  Today he is wearing loose-fitting black pants with a plain black, leather tie  belt with a silver buckle around his waist. A beige long sleeved jersey looks  both comfortable and warm. A lightweigh, size bigger traditional, leather  jacket is worn ontop of it.  A chunky watch is carried around his left wrist. The only jewelry visible are  a pair of small silver rings decorating his left ear and right eyebrow. The  top most part of a black tattoo is visible just above his color. The rest of  the pattern vanishes hidden under his collar.  People, persons. Not many, just a few and none of them particularly pleasant.  There's a guy over there shooting glances at Penny, grumbling to his friends.  Something about money. And Penny? She's just hangin'out, havin'a beer.  Alexander let's his gaze sweep past you. Only to return to you along with the  other guy's attention. Lowering the pool cue, he rubs it against the back of  your head. "For luck." he explains, blinking at you. "Going inside, doll?"  //.etro: Penny rolls "6" at diff 7          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Alexander walks in off the street. Alexander has arrived. Alexander wraps the plastic off of a cigarette package with one hand as he makes his way into the area. His other hand is busy, shouldering a pool cue as if it was a rifle. Stopping just short of the door leading into the bar, he turns his head to look around the people present. Alexander read your description.  Penny looks sideways at you, ducking fast out of the cue's way so that it lands somewhere between her neck and shoulder. "Don't," twirling the bottleneck, she inclines her head forward "ever," sliding her free hand down the cue "do that again" and pushes it back toward your chest with just enough force. Just enough to underline the insult to her person.  The guys grumbling in the corner have quieted a little and one coughs nervously under his breath. "Man, leave the lady alone."  Alexander swirs the cue and places its end against the floor, leaning just slightly against it, "I can't promise that. I'll make it up to you with a beer though. If you let me." A glance is shot the guys in the corner, and he smiles, "It seems chivalry isn't dead. Just hiding in a dirty bar."  You say, "No I don't think so" emphasis on the don't. Penny wobbles her beer at you, see? it's still mostly full, and steps back toward her perch between cigarette machine and public phone. Reaching into her pocket for a loose cig, she tucks it behind her ear for later "I'm sure you and your little stick can keep eachother company."  Alexander remains leaning against it for a moment, then straightens up and proceeds with walking with you, "Actually, it belongs to the bar. I borrowed it yesterday, and came to return it." He lays his arm over the phone, the one of the two machines most likely to be used less, facing you, "I'm Alec."  "And I'm not interested." Looking around for help from those guys isn't an option, so she smiles flat and tight, brows raised to further her point. Adjusting the grip on her beer bottle, Penny's fist a white-knuckled range around the brown glass.  //.etro: Penny rolls "willpower" privately to Penny at diff 7.          For a total of 1 success(es).  Alexander glances at your hand, nodding at it, "Come on, you don't need to do that. I'm too much of a coward to fight a girl anyway." He picks the reciever of the phone up and brings it to his ear, "Police, help. I'm being picked on by this white chick. Send backup." Smiling slightly, he puts the phone back in place, "I'm Alec.", lifting his brows as he tries again.  Penny stonewalls with a big pull on her beer. Shifting back on a rickety barstool for an absent bouncer, Penny sits unimpressed. Must get this alot. Posture changing second to second, it's obvious she carries no such prejudice. She nods back to the phone "Pick it up, dial 0. Then tell my boyfriend you're Alec."  Alexander shakes his head slowly, "I didn't ask to sleep with you, doll. Just to buy you a beer. And, possibly get your name. People come to bars to meet people, not to be left alone. Unless they want to be percieved as loners. Or enjoy torturing themselves. I've tasted the liqour here." He smiles at you, and wanders past you, "Okay. Can't blaim a guy for trying." The cue lowers once his back is turnt to you, and he is about to pat your behind with it once, "Enjoy your evening now."  ..except for the simple fact that Penny's sitting on a stool. There will be no ass-patting. She drinks. That's all she does. No farewell last-jab or anything as childish. It's not that kind of bar and it's definitely not that kind of night.  +recc for Alexander sent.  Alexander returns after about a minute from inside the pool hall. This time without the cue. Lifting his chin, he grins at you, "Take care, doll." Pulling the hood of his jacket up, he narrows his eyes slightly as he looks up at the street lights. And then he is gone, wandering up the sidewalk.  Alexander walks into the streets. Alexander has left.  You have just received a +recc from Alexander.

      //.etro: It is 06:18 am, early morning, on Monday the 20. day of October, 2008. The rich aroma from Starbucks draws you in. Starbucks(#547RIJM)   Contents: Mary Jacob Obvious exits: Out      A small table by the window (#1) has 3 empty places.  A larger table by the front door (#2) has 2 empty places.  A quiet booth in the back (#3) has 6 empty places.  A table near the serving counter (#4) has 1 empty place.    Present:   Mary - Jacob   A cozy table for two (#5) has 3 empty places.  A seat at the counter (#6) has 4 empty places.  A comfortable sofa (#7) has 3 empty places.  A table at the back (#8) has 3 empty places. Jacob sits at a table talking with Mary.  Mary shakes her head a bit, at Jacob. "I know a lot of people use the line..and it probably seems like a cop out, or an exagerration, but in my case it really -is- complicated, and there isn't really anyone I can tell about it, without putting them in danger."  Jacob watches her for a moment longer then shrugs his shoulder, "I can't make you say anything, but the offer stands if you change your mind. The relief might be worth it to you."  Nobody should be here so early; not the barrista, the guy with the newspapers and least of all Penny. She ambles in, keeping her head down lest the mermaid on the wall start yelling at her; she walks in a way that paranoids consider normal, one eye over her shoulder.  Mary read your description.  Mary looks around for a moment, noting the entry of Penny. At this hour, the place isn't exactly bustling. She looks back towards Jacob, and summons up a wan smile for him. "This is corny, but the offer alone helps. Even if I can't accept it. Not right now, anyway. I think for now my only smart course of action is to keep things to msyself."          Mary Roberts is what could be termed 'a little slip of a thing'. She's  not absurdly short, but she's definately several inches below that of most  women her age, reaching only 5'3" in height. Her build is slender and reedy,  the sort that a mere breeze could well blow over, and though she doesn't seem  unhealthy, it does seem as if she could do with a little more food in her on a  regular basis. Her hair is long, reaching to about mid-back, its hue a rich  mahogany, likely her best feature, what with the highlights of red sparkling  in its tresses. Her eyes are cerulean blue, quite pretty save that there's  sometimes circles beneath them, as if she didn't get quite enough sleep.  Framed by sooty lashes, the eyes are set in a heart-shaped face, with slightly  too-pale skin.. along with lack of food and sleep, it seems perhaps she  doesn't get enough sun, though there's enough pink in her cheeks that she  doesn't look unhealthy.         Mary is dressed somewhat casually, though not to the point of  bluejeans and teeshirts. Her pants are black courderoy, comfortable looking,  though they don't seem terribly worn. They fit her well enough that it's not  out of the realm of possibility that they were tailor-made for her. She wears  a cashmere sweater in an off-white shade overtop it, the neckline slightly  scooped, though not enough to really reveal much of anything. A pair of  leather boots are worn on her feet and, when outside, a long black trenchcoat  is worn over the entire ensemble. All in all, the mode of dress is rather  conservative, with nothing revealing or suggestive about it.  Jacob nods his head a touch, "All right." moving on, "So what sort of book are the sketches for?" glancing over at the notepad in front of Mary. Mary's lips twitch again. "Horror," she says, then shakes her head. "I guess art does imitate life, doesn't it?    Mary tacks a " onto that.  Jacob quirks a bit of a smile, "So it seems. Though if it were talking rabbits and flying horses I would hate to find the parallels there."  Penny talks in whispers to the girl behind the counter. The girl, of course, can't hear or understand a word Penny says and repeats "What?" and "Huh?" and "Is that english? Parlez-vous francais?" No it isn't english, no, no and no. Penny finally grabs a 'venti' cup, points at it and mimes 'please to be filling it now.' And hardly traumatized, the half-sleeping server gets Penny her coffee.  Mary's lips twitc. "I don't think talking and rabbits and flying horses are really part of the horror genre. Unless it's a carniverous bunny, or a fanged flying horse, and even then. No... it's dark stuff. Kinda like my... uh. Like Toby Roberts' books, if you've read 'em." Which is kind of like saying the same thing about Stephen King. Only with darker themes. Jacob chuckles, "So horror is all you do then? No fields of daisies and butterfiles?" he glances over at the counter for a moment, looking at the cups that change hands before fishing in his pocket to pull out a bit of cash.  "Bunnicula," Penny butts in, adapting her tongue to english in slow syllables "bunnies with fangs." Horror, yes. Satisfied she got it right, Penny pulls her coffee off the serving counter looking for where they hid the stirry things and sugar. From that hidden area she adds "Loved your brother's work. He's no Clive Bark..er..was..um."  Silence.  Jacob glances between Penny and Mary, quirking an eyebrow as he pauses in pulling out a few dollars.  Mary looks up at Penny. "The celery stalks at midnight," she states. Then blinks at the woman, at what she adds, and forces a bit of a smile. "Still is.. if you count the post mortum publications." She then looks back at Jacob, shaking her head. "If you count what I do for myself, no. Though I'm not really the fields of daisies sort of girl."  Penny reappears from that region beyond the moon and stars, more importantly out of sight of the mermaid on the wall, brushing loose sugar-substitute from the front of her jacket. Noisey nylon swipe-swiping. "Hasat workout, post mortem" hovering over Mary's shoulder, unaware that intruding is socially unacceptable "you channel'im or somin?"  Jacob decides to aquire himself another drink, getting up from his seat and heading over to the counter for a moment, quietly asking for what he wants.  Mary goes tense just for the -briefest- of moments, though it's probably just due to the invasion of personal space. After a moment, though, she takes a breath, and forces herself to smile. "Of course not. He wrote a lot before he died.. it's pretty rough and unedited, but.. the editors want it. so I clean it up for them.. did it with a lot of his other books anyway... he hated editting."  //.etro: Penny rolls "4" privately to Mary at diff 7.          For a botch! Mary pages: Doh? :) Long distance to Mary: Penny hahs. Penny thinks you're lying when you say 'of course not' ...now a botch on that idea? I might be a little overbearing for a few minutes ;)  From afar, Mary grins. Go for it, it's all good. :)  Jacob pays for his coffee and collects it with a to-go lid. He moves back over towards Mary and offers a smile, "Its time for me to get on my way, it was a pleasure seeing you again. Take care."  "So what you're really sayin'is yeah, yeah?" She takes a seat at Mary's table, turns it around with her palm and straddles it, leans in "Does he have a lot to say? I heard when that John Edwards guy got fired from SciFi he started teaching classes on how to do it on account'a he couldn't pay his rent." She sips big from her cup, milky coffee mustache lingering "So didja like take one'a his classes after yer brother kicked it to the other side?" Starstruck, maybe. Penny rambles at an incredible speed.  Jacob stands and leaves a table near the serving counter. Jacob has departed. Jacob read your description.  Mary's looking rather uncomfortable, shooting Jacob an almost pleading look, though she doesn't ask him to stay aloud. "Uh... it was nice to talk to you," she manages. "And.. thanks. For the offer and all." She then turns back to eye Penny. "I'm not sure what you're talking about," she says, edgily. Clearly very much uncomfortable.  Jacob looks to Penny and frowns faintly, then moves to put his cup on the table between the two as he turns to Mary and says, "You've been here for some time, surely you're tired? I can walk you home on my way out if you'd like."  At your table Penny does pause. She looks out the window and then back to the tabletop "I do know," emphasis on the know part "Didn't mean to startle you or nothin' it's just it's my turn to be the mu-uh-manager of our kitchen this week." She knows what she's talking about - you might not, but she isn't overly concerned about making sense. Outwardly. "So."  Mary pauses a moment, looking at Penny searchingly, then up to Jacob. She looks a little uncertain, possibly even freaked, but she shakes her head anyway, smiling a little, even. Which is saying something, from Mary. "I'll be okay. But thanks."  Jacob pauses still, his hand resting on his cup as he offers once more, "Are you sure?" his tone implying she should be totaly before he will budge any.  At your table Mary seems to be opting not to comment on all that, at least until Jacob's left.  At your table It was a business-like "so" delivering a 'let's talk' look just  on it's heels. She looks past you for a moment at Jacob, an eyebrow arching.  Mary nods, sowly, reaching out to touch Jacob's arm, though she doesn't smile  this time. "I'm sure," she says. "Really, I am. I'll be fine.. and home, for  now, is just accross the street."  Penny looks past Mary to Jacob. It seems impossible that her eyebrow could  arch any further but it does. She smiles, too, miming Mary's gesture. Penny  even twiddles her fingers.  At your table Mary seems to have gotten that.. she's just waiting. All things  in their proper time, and all times in their proper things, or something like  that.  Jacob hmms and nods his head, moving to collect his cup and look to Penny,  commenting simply, "Play nice." before moving for the door.  Penny snorts into her coffee upon handling it again. Funny guy.  Jacob walks out into the busy world leaving the rich aroma of Starbucks behind. Jacob has left. You have just received a +recc from Jacob.  At your table Mary watches Jacob leave, shaking her head a little bit. "I wonder what he meant by that," she murmurs to herself, then turns her head slowly back, until she's peering somewhat steadily at Penny. Not to say that she isn't still unsure of all this, but at least she's able to make eye contact directly. "So," she repeats.  At your table Penny says "It's what little boys say to little girls when they've been kicked out of the club-house. Come on, Mary" Penny levels pretty quickly "A parrot you are not." She rests her chin on folded forearms across the back of the chair. Head tilted just-so.  At your table It should be pretty clear at this point that Penny's probably one of the good guys. She gives off that vibe. Or something.  At your table "Are you sure?" Mary murmurs, softly. "I could be, you know. A parrot in the shape of a girl. Stranger things have happened, you know." She's watching you closely, with the wariness of someone that's simply not used to talking about certain things to anyone. The look of someone that only has themselves to trust. Okay, so it sucks to have that luck, but hey, what can  you do? "What do you know?" she asks, suddenly. Bluntly.  John Smith comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. John Smith has arrived. John Smith wanders in, rubbing his hands together to fight off the effects of the cold morning air. John Smith makes his way to the front counter and looks up at the menu, then back to the cashier, "Uh.. nope.. still just the regular."  At your table Penny acquires that look. The lucid moment. Her eyes drift toward the mural on the wall "It's listening," gestures with her chin. She sips again and offers instead "We have a lot of mutual acquaintances, you and me, a lot of people that want some very exclusive" implying something more than singular "relationships to evolve." She tilts her coffee sideways "Some for better," tilts it the other way "some for worse." These things she says are said with such calmness at their center it's impossible for them to be taken as threatening.  John Smith searchs the room hopfully while he waits. John Smith read your description.  At a table, Penny straddles a chair looking sideways every now and then. She's having some kind of very serious conversation with Mary. Some might argue that it's too early for serious conversations but there's a look on Penny's face, a posture that is impossible to mistake.  At your table Mary goes still for a moment, gaze rather intent upon Penny. -Very- intent, in point of fact. "maybe if you could give me a name, I might feel a little more... confident about furthering this. See, here's the thing. I'd really like to talk to you about this, but I don't really want to do it here. But there's some people after me, apparently. Someone willing to shell out a lot of money for folks to mess with me. So, y'know, I'm kinda wary.. can you give a name? So I know that you're on the up and up. I'm sorry if that's rude, but I'm a little freaked right now, over.... over a lot of things."  Penny goes "OH JESUS" fairly suddenly and really loud.  Mary's also looking serious, wariness and curiosity flaring through her expression as she talks to Penny, leaning forward a little, hands resting on an open sketchpad. The page has only a few lines drawn on it, nothing concrete, and the pencil has been dropped, to lay forgotten next to the pad.  John Smith starts slightly at the larger woman's exclaimation. He seems much more awake now.  John Smith glances over to see what the cause of the outburst is.  At your table "I'm such an asshole. It's this fucking dr.. " cutting herself off pretty quickly "drip. it's keeping me up nights and augh,. Shitshit. SHIT I'm so sorry." She puts her coffee down and gets up a little to turn the chair around and scoot in to the table. She grabs your hand, too. It's a shake "I'm Penny, PEN-ny. Oh I'm so sorry I thought I'd said."  Mary jumps, noticably, leaning back against her seat at the sudden exlamation from Penny, blinking at her companion, though she relaxes again as her hand is suddenly grabbed, and softer words exchanged  Penny turns her chair toward Mary, right hands clasped in some kind of handshake, speaking lower and more intently than before.  At your table "Um. I'm Mary.. I guess you already new that. Only, that's... not what I meant." She grins, and though it's brief, the expression brightens her face enough to prove that she's a little amused. "It's good to know your name, though, but what I was asking is about who the mutual uh.. acquaintances are. And you're not rude, really."  John Smith looks from one woman to the other for a moment before deciding that an intense conversation between two lesbians this early in the morning is entirely none of his business. He glances desperately at the cashier to see if his order is ready, which, in fact, it is. He pushes the change needed to pay for his coffee across the counter with his right hand while his left seeks out  a couple of napkins which he retrieves and uses to wrap around the very hot container of freshly brewed coffee.  John Smith mutters, "Not gonna do THAT twice..."  At your table Penny lets go of your hand and oh-oh-ohs, nodding "Mister B." Really that's all she'll say about that. Best to keep as much under-wraps as possible is basically always Penny's policy.  Mary would probably be absolutely mortified if she knew that such an assumption had been made about that, especially over a mere handshake and intense conversation. She's oblivious, though, and is thus saved a lot of blushing and suchwise embarrassment.  At your table Mary ohhhs, softly, and nods. "Him," she murmurs. "I'm not always sure I trust him.. but he's done an awful lot for me. Including paying the guys I just mentionned double what they'd been promised, if they'd leave me alone. So.. yeah. I guess he's a good guy. I'm just nervous of about everyone. Chalk it up to my recent career as a recluse. Um. Yeah, so I guess.. I duno. We should talk, but not here.. I don't know where, though."  John Smith plops himself down on one of the chairs near the window and opens peels open the lip of the container lid and takes a cautious sip of the steaming liquid within.  Totally understandable where J. Smith might come up with that idea. If this were San Fancisco that might be true. But it's Canada and there are stranger things here than shaved women. Penny continues to speak to Mary, mindful of her ears.  Satisfied the contents won't sear off his lips, John takes a bolder drink from the cup.  At your table Penny says "I've got a hotel room. It's pretty secure if a bit messy," she starts to get up "unless," nodding out the window "you don't think home is safe enough?" Gliding from one subject to the next without much hedging "Wouldn't trust him far as I could throw'im, good on you, 'cause it's not the people he's paying you've got to fear from."  John Smith stares out the window, watching people living out their lives, or at least struggling to get to work on time.  John Smith yawns, and stretches his arms out, revealing to no one in particular, "man... no more fuckin' nights out..."  At your table Mary's brow furrows a little bit, at that, and she starts to rise a moment later. "I've not been staying at home. I've been staying with friends, and.. well. They don't need to be dragged into this. It's bad enough I'm with them, but there was near mutiny when I threatened to leave. I have a home, but I've been away so long that I can't guarantee how safe it is, so.. let's stick with the hotel room. K?"  Mary starts to get up, about a moment after Penny does, apparently leaving with her. This surely can't be doing wonders for the false assumption about what's going on between them.  John Smith slumps forwards after his stretch, as though the act has drained him of all his energy He yawns again, trying to remove the sleep from his body with a quick shake of his head, "buhwuhuh..."  John Smith shivers to complete the action.  You stand and leave a table near the serving counter.  John Smith glances up... yep... just as he suspected.  Mary stands and leaves a table near the serving counter.  John Smith read your description.  "M'beat, let's just cab it over to my place okay?" World-weary and without any pre-empting, Penny gets the door out for Mary, leaving her cup behind for the staff to clean-up after. So efficient here, they even swipe down the mess of sugar and stirry things. Holding the door open with her booted foot, Penny zips up her jacket and amscrays. See, that's the nice thing about assumptions; generally they're never wrong.  John Smith gets that distant day-dreaming look in his eyes as he discretely (or so he thinks) watches the women leave... together.  Mary walks out of Starbucks followed by the rich aroma of fresh coffee. Mary has arrived.  "Place is a dump," nodding up across the street towards the bar "they let in anybody." She steps out toward the street and looks for that elusive early-morning cab. Everyone else is taking the subway; she looks that way, too, dismissing it with "Eva has the map."  You have just received a +recc from John Smith.  Mary follows you out to the street, still oblivious to what's been assumed. Ah, well.. ignorance is bliss, sometimes. "A cab's fine," she murmurs. "I'm a little tried, too. Not been sleeping so well, and... well. Dumps happen. It's in the eye of the beholder. Who/s Eva?"  Penny explains in the cab-ride over "Oh she's usually tour-guide but she hasn't shown her face in a while. Least not since the move here."  Mary follows inside,looking rather blank, though she seems to have decided not to ask too much more. Not just yet. Not until the safety of a room has been reached, at any rate.  Penny picks up a few things from the lobby; namely food from the breakfast buffet, some local-color pamphlets and extra coffee-packet filter things for the cheap coffee-maker in the bathroom. She stops again in front of Room 174, knocking quietly as she unlocks the door "Be decent, ladies present.." though who she's talking to is a mystery. Could be no one.  Mary enters the apartment.  Mary looks a little uncertain as Penny calls out, brow furrowing a little as she follows the other woman into the apparently empty hotel room, which she scans quickly, as if checking for such a thing. She looks back to Penny, blinking. "Checking for Eva?" she asks.  Penny laughs under her breath, something like 'eva couldn't get in here if she tried'(suggesting Eva is uncomfortably large), kicking something in a box into the closet. Hard. There's a large burn-hole in the carpet between the beds and the detrius of months of living in one room; a pile of take-out boxes in the corner, three laptops set on the desk all rigged together and a robe in dry-cleaning plastic hanging over the bathroom door. Presumable Penny's.  "Don't mind the mess."  Mary gives the linked up computers a curious look, as she makes her way over to perch herself on the edge of one of the beds. "It's not that bad," she says, trying to be kind, perhaps. "I've seen worse, anyway." She sets her bag down - having stuffed her sketchbook back into it while exiting - and looks back to you. "So... can I start by asking what Mr. Browne told you, exactly?"  Penny unwinds herself from the satchel at her side, tossing it into the headboard. She kicks off her boots on the way into the bathroom. Half-closing the door behind her, the conversation carries on slightly echoed "Like you? I trust about only half'a what he says. What I /do/ think is true" implying this is what he said "is that you have some wealthy bad-asses after you." The sound of water running is low; the sink-tap running "And they have nothing better to do with their time and money than to make you uncomfortable and unhappy because they know where you are." She comes from the bathroom minus the jacket and two-of-the-three-shirts, toweling off her face. "So tell me about him." Singular.  Mary sighs, and flops back against the bed, legs dangling over the edge. "Specify. Which 'him'? If it's Mr. Browne, I can only tell you so much, because I don't know myself. If it's who's after me... my only assumption can be that it's the person I saw murder the man I love. With a chainsaw. Or someone close to him. If it's someone else, well. I don't know. Who're we talking about.. and what did Mr. Browne tell you that you don't believe?"  "That pee eye Gabe? was your boyfriend?" the towel hanging in her hand "dang girl. Well him, that's the one." She sits on the other bed with a sudden solemnity "Nice guy," opening up the floor.  Mary sighs, softly. "I don't think he was my boyfriend. I never told him I loved him... never had the chance, though. He told me, though. It was the last thing he said to me. he was a very good man." She's staring at the ceiling, still, and adds, more quietly, "In spite of what was done to him. But.. this would be easier if I knew what you already knew. There's... things. Things I'm not supposed to talk about, though I think people who know are exempt. Only I don't know how to tell who knows. Gabe was the one that made it all make sense."  "Aw hon, he messed you up, din'ee" dropping into a drawl that seems more natural for her, for the hour. "He trusted you with his secrets - of course he was your boyfriend." Sympathetic, she nods a little "It'll make sense without him, too. You want some coffee, hon?" She gets up, needs to do something with her hands. Poking around the coffee packets, the pastries "I know all about that guy with the" she mimes the way to hold a chainsaw with her fists. "It's kin'a intense, innit.."  Mary shakes her head. "That's the thing, Penny. He didn't mess me up.. not at all. It was him dying, and the way he died.. I can't even count the number of times he saved me. And there are.. things. Things he could have done to me. to ensure his own safety. Things he should've done, but he wouldn't. Because he didn't want to mess me up." She sits up again. "Coffee would be good," she adds.  Penny looks over her shoulder, something reproachful lingering, as she heads back to the bathroom. Kicking open the door, she reveals another kind of mess. Just past her on the floor is a plastic bag, lots of hair overflowing from it. "Any man that doesn't tell me where *I* stand until the minute he dies? is in the messed-up column'a my book" Going through the motions of rinse-fill-slide-presto, coffee Penny also adds "So had you met Earl before?"  Mary smiles a little bit, just for a moment. "He was getting there," she says. "It was building. He may not have known til then.. he did say it, though." But then, the question registers, and she flinches. "Yeah," she says. "Yeah, I... had. Which makes it a bit worse, when you get right down to it. I knew who he was, and vice versa. He knows where I live. Part of why I don't trust the safety of my house."  The pop and hiss of ready-made two-cup coffee sizzles out "Prolly more than that, hon" emerging from the bathroom with some Holiday Inn-stamped mugs "guy that can come and go out of thin-air has a lot more going for him than charisma and a little black book." She hands you a coffee and takes the edge of the bed again, folding up her left leg beneath her "No such thing as too paranoid."  Mary curls her fingers around the cup, holding it in her hands. "He can do more than that. I think he can mess with people's minds.. hell, I think he messed with mine. But I know what he is. Same thing Gabe was, only... Gabe fought it with everything he had. Earl, I think, reveled in it." She takes a sip, and relaxes a bit as blessed caffeine eases down her throat. She looks over at you, and considers you. "I'm guessing you know, too. I don't think Mr. Browne would've told you about what happened, if you didn't, but I'm wondering why he told you. Hell,I'm wondering why he's helping me. He doesn't seem like the altruistic sort."  snorts into her mug the same way she did back at Starbucks. "I haven't known him that long either and I can say with complete certainty he's got his own pimped-out, gangst'agenda." Sipping just a little "Listen, you don't wanna know a guy like that too long. Won't help your reputation or your career. Got any plans? Know what you'll do next?"  Mary shrugs her shoulders. "I'll keep going. Not much else I can do, really. When you don't know where to turn, moving ahead is generally the best course of action. Beats standing still or moving backwards. I've got the comission to work on. The novel I'm working on has been put on hold, so I've got a bit of a break. Other than that? No idea. Wish I had more of a long term goal, but I guess you have to work with what you have."  Penny's disappointed. Genuinely and truly. "You're not gonna fight back?" She leans forward, sets her mug on the edges of the burned carpet. "I don't understand..." For the first time all morning, Penny looks confused. There's something else she isn't saying, some criticism keeping her lips pursed as she looks at you.  "How can I?" Mary says. "What can I do against them, besides tell people that -might- be able to do what I can't? That's why I told Gideon Browne. I don't trust the man, but he seems to access to firepower that I don't. I told him everything I knew about them, more than I'd told anyone else. I told the cops the parts they'd believe." She looks over at you, and sighs. "If I were stronger.. if I had some advantage I thought would help me, I'd do something. But I don't. The only answer I can make to what's been done is to keep goin, to not let it kill me. What would you have me do? I may not be entirely ordinary, but I have nothing to use against them. Not yet."  Penny says "Gideon Browne's firepower" mulling that one over. "He thinks he's gunning down the invisible man" incredulous to the point of disbelief ".. and that's supposed to work how? And you think so, too? Where'd you meet this g.." rubbing her temples. Taking a breath, Penny starts over "He did forget to mention how you hooked up with him."  "Chance," she replies. "He overheard me say something about being an eye witness. Unfortunately, so did a reporter, who started harrassig me and.. well.. pretty much chasing me with a camera. He offered to get me out, and I accepted. We talked.. he freaked me out pretty badly, but.. I dunno. I don't trust him, but I think he's got resources. I /know/ he's got money, given what he paid whoever was after me to leave me alone. You don't shell out two grand on a stranger if you don't have an excess of cash. I dunno. My instincts tell me he might be able to pull it off, and if he can't... well. He got himself into it. I didn't want to tell him anything, at first, but he kept insisting, and he flat out told me he knew the killer was a vampire - how, I don't know - so.. I told him what I knew." She looks over, clutching at her cup. "If you've any better suggestions, feel free to offer them. I'm doing what I can, Penny, but it's -hard-. I don't know for sure who to trust, and I don't know for sure how can help. What you do, if you were me?"  "When you run a strip joint, two grand's a flash in the pan." Maybe Mary's a smidge too innocent for the likes of Penny. "If I were you? or if I were in your situation?" There is some vast difference between the two, the distinction coming clear "If I were you, I would've asked G for a contingency plan in case his ship doesn't come in." Whatever that means. "If I were you, I would start packing. I would go underground and tell my publisher to fuck off and go to Fiji if I were you. Vampires are *crazy*."  "But I'm not you. And while I'm not in the position to throw a little static in their direction, I wouldn't run. Me? I'd make life difficult for Earl. And bone-up on my Dracula." It's a kind of smirk, but it's as true a statement as anything she's said so far.  Mary shakes her head. "I won't run. I'm a little harder to find right now than usual, and I'm not doing butkiss for the publishers. I'm doing the comission work for Mr. Ivanov, but that's it... and I met him in the daytime. I don't think he's related." She closes her eyes for a moment, and then shakes her head. "No. I won't run. I'll just be careful, and keep following my instincts. As for Mr. Browne, he's offered me more direct protection, but I haven't taken it. Instinct again. I think there might be a hidden pricetag in it." She rubs  at the back of her neck, and gulps down her coffee. "I gotta go soon, but I have a question for you, and I've been pretty candid so I think it's a fair one. Why all this? Why're you asking me this stuff, and why'd you bring me here? Why the interest?" She pauses, then adds, "Okay, so it's more than one question, but it's all related."  "It's as safe as any place and I've got a vested interest," gesturing in a circle with her fingers at the space between the beds. "Don't like running blind, I had to ask." Interrupted by a sound coming from the closet, a thump-thump "Just the pipes. Hot water pipe's in the closet." She readjusts, both feet on the floor "Look it's just my nature - have to know the full score from the horse's mouth," a pause trying not to insult "so to speak."  Mary drifts to her feet, nodding a bit. "Well.. now you do. Now you know. Don't tell anyone you don't trust completely, okay? I'm not dumb enough to ask that you don't tell anyone at all." She sets the mug down, and turns, heading for the door. "Time for me to scurry back to my hidey hole now, I think, before they send out search party on bikes or something. I think they actually might." A wan smile is tossed over her shoulder. "Thanks for the coffee."  Then, she's gone.

      Docks(#1156RJ)       The Docks are several long man made quays which protect the ships as they  rest in harbour. The size of these ships range from the smallest commercial  lake ships to the largest ocean going vessels that can make their way down the  St Lawrence Seaway. There are always ships from the USA and a couple from  other countries around the world to keep the docks busy. Like any commercial  docks this one is just as dirty and cluttered, but there isn't the overall  feeling of danger that some large dock areas exude. Toronto is spared the  problems of the docks simply because the docks are on a special made man  peninsula built to house the docks and keep it separate from the city proper.  All told this isn't a picturesque place to visit and there aren't many  legitimate reasons to be here at night. To the north and west is the heart of  the city.  Contents: Obvious exits: Off     Tom arrives from Parliment and Queens Quay. Tom has arrived.  "There's only one instant, and it's right now. And it's eternity."         - Waking Life (2001)          What is the measure of a man? Well, if it happens to be this man, the  measure is just under two meters with a slight paunch to his stocky frame. He  is rather unspeakably average-looking - not dashing, not debonaire, not  handsome. A plain, forgettable face half-covered by a full beard kept in an  admirable state of trim. Decent cheekbones, straightand thin nose, reasonably  good teeth, skin evenly tanned by accidental but prolonged exposure to the sun  in some climate more suitable than this one. Not a bad haircut - but not  exactly glamourous, either; black hair close cropped to the skull, buzzed down  almost to the scalp. Serene hazel eyes gaze out from behind thin glasses,  somewhat discreet oval frames in a low-key matte black.         The clothing is simple, utilitarian. A well-fitted black polo-shirt  with three buttons at the throat. A pair of pressed khakis with a pleat down  the front of either leg, sinched at the waist with a brown leather belt. A  pair of brown leather docksiders. When outside, he wears a large black wool  coat with flat black buttons.    Not the average pedestrian - first impression:         Tall & strong, great teeth, killer body.         The refined sythesis of hard living and regular controlled substance  abuse is as much a draw as it is obvious. It's there in her eyes - give it a  name, call it calculating. With just one look it can be assumed she has  friends in low places.         How does one express truth and beauty simeltaneously? One shaves one's  head. The clean look of her pale scalp, compared to the tan ridges at her  forehead and neck, tells it was done only recently. Not even the fuzz at the  roots remains. It is a perfectly normal skull-shape and bears no mark; cut,  nick or otherwise. She has an incredibly pretty face. An eternity of cheek  bones. Sun poisoning there in tiny bright pink spots; a long neck and a  quantity of cheap-looking gold chains; lips dry and threaded with a  pomegranate stain; applied shadows of gold and brown around green eyes. A  natural angle-shaped eyebrows, sun-scorched blonde and obvious on the skin; a  tan suffered in the desert, a tan that is beginning to peel away. Dead white  slough. Her skin, taut and leathery, wants a pound of prevention, wants to  lose the deeply exposed color it holds. The backs of her hands are scabbed  over, red around the knuckles and nailbeds, yet her fingernails are manicured  ..well painted at least, a titian-red.         She dresses in layers. Loose jeans, jack boots, a fitted t-shirt  (white) under a button-down (suede), under a denim jacket. It's this article  of clothing around which all others revolve. It's fitted, but big enough to  keep her assets in check. Not so much decorated as amplified with patches,  they keep the jacket in one piece, its original seams and thread long gone.  Between the blue-white-red bullseye patch and a black&white John Lennon  likeness is a flat-head thumbtack, white. Across the back panel a fabric  replica of an album cover is safety-pinned (Santana's ABRAXAS) a-typical of  jackets like this.  It's the evening, and a warm front is butting upwards, from the south. The heat slips and slides below the cold front, and a slow fog rolls in. The thrumming groan of fog horns ripples over the water, vibrating through the fog as though it were radio waves through the aetheric medium. Tom is slunk low into his wool coat, the collar turned up around his neck. The faint clip-clop of shoes, dampened by the moisture within the water logged boards on the dock itself. He whistles into the night, whistles as he walks, a neat little tune to take a late evening's walk by.  Noises on the dock, noises beyond traffic and bar trouble; seagulls sleeping and the lapping water beaneath heavy-booted footsteps. Mysterious noises of moored and anchored boats shuttling back and forth, the combined smells of salt and gasoline, the wind spooking the fish. And among these, Penny. Figure out there in the mist, her jean jacket no protection against the weather, a flask and an unlit cigarette her defense. A sailboat's rigging comes loose and knocks violently into a metal post. Bang bangbang, gunshots rippling, forever echoing out to sea.  "Hey, got a light?"  Lost in his own thoughts, in the general swirl of atmosphere, like the end of Casablanca if Raymond Chandler'd wrote it. Deals are done out in the shadows, an Iranian and an extraterrestrial grasping hands in an ancient Masonic greeting back behind some cargo containers. The wind whips up along an alleyway, giving his overcoat an appropriately dramatic flutter. At the stimuli, Tom's attention is called up and away. Eyes float lazily towards Penny... he palms a silver zippo - brings it up in his cupped palm, fingers open. "Yeah." Still a little absent, the words floating up out of him like  exhaust.  She leans in and cups cold hands over his, breathes out past your face and not down. The damp sag in the air makes ash of the end almost immediately. She drags hard again and leans back. "Thanks," cheap wine and stale cologne; things not her own wreathe and claim her posture, slack and sour. The distant remains of laughter makes its way quietly through the atmosphere from the west, a party at the yacht club. Music, too, on the wind in time. A bellow of song and a foghorn in alternate bursts. Penny seems not to notice, her focus somewhere between your burns and her own.  "Welcome, absolutely welcome," comes the distract answer, somewhat unfocused eyes wandering off towards the distant sounds of laughter. A squint through the fog, as though by looking hard enough he could see the source of it. A thoughtful nod as Tom retracts his warm hands - flipping the zippo closed, sliding it away into a pocket on the coat. "Nice night for a party." He withdraws slightly, to a distance permitting dignified conversation. Voice soft, low, "Is that what brings you on a wander out here?"  The fog rolls up and back, harbor lights twinkling in the wake. It must be strange business, whatever the reason, a girl alone on the docks. She nods by way of an answer at first, cigarette pressed to her lips, then offers "Stood up, blind date. Place was beat anyway." Sheltered somewhat from the brunt of the arctic winds, the whistling in the eaves is enough to distract conversation for minutes at a time "You?"  A quick glance over a shoulder to where shadowy men in shadowy robes speak occulted words with their fellows, a storage facility housing much in the way of darkness and forgotten lores. Then, back off into the distance, where the music still wafts through the fog from. "I'm a bit late for it, I think. It'd be more trouble than it was worth to explain it - better, I guess, not even to show up." He drags his palm along the close-cropped hair, looks down at his shoes. "Better not to bother. I only just arrived - I'm allowed."  Men in the distance tend to stay that way; Penny isn't concerned. Theory and practice tell us they'll be disappearing into the ether as silently as they arrived. "You were supposed to be there, huh. Wouldn't worry - they're a little stuffy." She pulls a face, "Yacht clubs," wrinkles her nose at it "not  worth the effort. Tight-laced and buttoned up." Eleven o'clock bells toll from some far-off cathedral and reminded suddenly to some unwritten law, Penny offers quickly "D'you smoke?" fingering another cigarette out of her top-most pocket.  "Well, long story," Tom replies, reaching up to rub his forehead lightly with his fingertips. The eyes wander away from the girl, away from the gatherings, away from the yacht, out into the place where the ocean falls off of the world. Squints some, as though he could see out into that oblivion with only  the help of a bit more clarity. "I guess it's similar to my attitude towards yacht clubs. I go. But I try not to make a habit of it."  Well take it." she won't hear an excuse as a no, extending it toward you  "Should smoke like you drink, always in good company," implying that yacht clubs aren't, that she is. The authority in her slightly drawled words is a fabrication, alcoholic in origin and deliverance. She slouches further out of the wind, making a buffer of her shoulder.   "I don't usually smoke cigarettes, but I'll make an exception for political gain." Tom grabs it with a smooth gesture of thumb and forefinger, flipping it and letting the butt rest between slightly parted lips. Palms the zippo, flips it open again. A quick gesture of his thumb across the flint-wheel. Flame  lurches up and kisses the tip of his cigarette, which ignites with a slow hiss of combustion. "The bird fights its way out of the egg," Tom quotes, as from memory, as a fundamentalist might quote scripture - distracted, meandering, "the egg is the world. Who would be born must destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God is Abraxas." He's winding his way closer, once more, all comfortable, affable, sociable grin. "Then, here's to good company, Miss...?"  Words murmured as she shrugs her jacket closer together "the highest good and the worst evil" underscoring the quote she follows it to the conclusion, a natural progression in her own smoke and haze. Fancy that. She doesn't stare quite at you but there's a certain concentration lent to that look, a measuring - just how much weight should she give it. "Delightful, Penny" she smiles a little "all the guys call me that on account of I'm not bitter at all," Awl, twice. The tool that makes the tiny holes. "Mister.."  "Blaine. Thomas, or Tom, but rarely Tommy." Steady hands stroke back over the close-cropped hair. "Nice to meet you." The arm offered out, off to the side, in Penny's direction, his body on an axis along the diagonal. Better feng shui, they say. "They call me that because it's what my parents named me, I guess. But I chose Tom. Or it chose me." There's a strange sliding quality to him, perhaps indicative of some excesses taken with his body chemistry, some tinkering with this pill or that drink. The strange extroversion common to the twisted.  Penny can sense it almost immediately; it's the kind of thing that might put out a vibe to the right kind of people. Physical peculiarities that become familiar like the right note in a scale, the third strike, the exact moment when the feedback stops "Pleasure Tom, " and she continues to smoke with her other hand, proximity threatening to burn with her lazy swag.  With a grin, Tom risks it, all for the sake of social interaction. A good firm grip, a light squeeze. The tamest tremor in his hand, rippling up his forearm, an autonomous grip of muscle groups. "Pleasure, Ms. Dreadful." The knowing smile of the clever and the wicked splits his mouth. "I'm thinking we ought to get coffee or something similarly trite. I know a fellow who'll sell a filled thermos of coffee, mostly to the dockworkers, just a few hundred feet or so from here."  Nothing risked, nothing gained, eh? Brighter and more alert, breaking out of miasma. A good firm grip. The genuine article, her responding smile just as conspicuous and conspirtatorial. "Yes, coffee is the best cliche back home" because the accent wasn't enough, she'll walk on if you start on the right foot. "too strong, too hot and you always get what you pay for, yes. Coffee. The guys don't get it," insinuating they're lacking though really it's anyone's guess "never will. S'okay, they're good people."

      The security guards pay a tad extra heed to punk-rawk Mickey. Chase looks back lazily as he enters, "What the shit..." Who knew beer needed so much protection. Well, perhaps from monster alcoholics and drug addicts, they do. Hello Chase, hello Penny.  No, they never did like our kind. In fact, there's a kind of active animosity in their eyes. Sending out one of their stockboy minions to 'unpack' and 'restock' is a thinly vieled surviellance tack.  Trolling the aisles, Penny's pushing a cart with a case of Labatt's in the bottom, just getting her shopping started. The early afternoon brought in a truckload of frat & sorority kids; she stands in sharp contrast to their bluster and noise, a very serious woman on a mission. She pushes the cart back and forth, squeaky-wheeling the college kids away.  "No fuckin' Coors." On the verge of outrage, Chase pays in spades for having bad taste in beer north of the border. His perusing stops near the chill stale air leaking from the cracks of the refrigerating system. The man's now frozen in front of one of the windows, a plethora of micro-brewed beers beckon his attention. But he's lost in some kind of intense calculation, perhaps figuring out what kind of possible substitute there could be for the Silver Bullet.  "Oi, 'ets Nazi beer anyway. You don't want that," friendly-like, now.  The squeaky wheel was coming upon you under further rattling of wine bottles; a whole army of dark green bottles holds the line in the back of her cart. Penny reaches into the fridge door next to that one and starts pulling out boxed wine, up-ending them into the front part. "Try that one," chin-points at a yellow label "the old man digs it."  "Yeah, I know." Chase looks disenchanted. Way to piss in his beer. Eyes are downcast, pretending to spot something on his boots. "But the shit's good." Trying hard to convince Penny the politics of that particular Beer Baron doesn't matter. But you can see it irks him. FInally though, he locks upon the proffered label with suspicion. "What's that then." He folds over to inspect. "Uncle Grampa's Honey Pot, Wheat Ale...." The square jawed man contemplates. "Looks gay."  "I'm just sayin' - don't hafta get all bitchy about it. Shit man, it's just beer, what's your problem?" Penny, taciturn. She makes to shove past you and get a six pack out just to prove her point. Or something. Maybe her elbow 'accidentally' catches you in the arm as she's turning back to the cart. "You got somethin'a say just say it. Don't go dissin'the old man," leveling with a look; that oh-yeah? look so common "No need for that, he's good people."  "Alright, alright, heysoos de christo. Don't queen out on me." Chase raises one side of his thin smile and holds up callused hands. "Look." The reach for Uncle Grampa's Honey Pot Wheat Ale is a display of nonaggression. "I'm gonna check out the old man's taster's choice." A 6er is raised, though absent eyes have to double check the label. "Say, who's the old man anyways? I know 'm then?"  Penny does a where-am-I lean to read the signs, doublechecks that aisle there and that other one there. "Yeah y'do - Comps. Hawaii Five-oh?" assuming you'd know exactly what she's on about, Penny keeps walking. Now we're aiming for the white wine and mixer collection. We're casually ignoring the clerk in the apron shadowing us and sticking together 'cause there's safety in numbers. "Toss it in," nodding at your six and the toxic-looking lime green daquiri stuff on your side. "he was at the thing the other night."  "Oh, oh. Dude with the 10/90?" Chase asks, but knows. "Oh yeah. I 'member him. Right then." For some reason it seems an acceptable idea to follow the suggestions of a man with a mullet on the complicated subject of beer. The squat man nods rhythmically and follows in tow. The 6er's in the basket, and he finally realizes the amount of alcohol Penny is loading up on could fund a small party. "What is all this shit?" Pointy finger points.  Nodding, she yeah-hims in the middle of that " I do the shopping this week,"  her response as casual as it is vague. Hangs a left into the next. Here we have vodka in all varieties and colors. With pepper, with citrus, without alcohol percentages on the label. Her fingers crawl over bottles, slipping both hands onto four bottles of The Tall Blonde. She holds them close and heaves them over the cart's rail. "Oh and they say we might be moving in. So there's the housewarming to consider. Things to keep in mind."  Tom steps in from the street. Tom has arrived.  "Tits." Chase affords approval and lingers towards the -extra- peppered beef jerky. A long irregularly shaped piece of dried cow skin is pulled from one of the bins. "This is shaped like Argentina." Perhaps an astute observation or drifting gaze, his boots follow Penny and her cart of mobile death up the Vodka isle. The store clerk notes their presence with a keen eye. "When ya movin' then?" The punk returns to fall in line, tasty beefy treat in check.  Shrugged down into his coat, gripping his suitcase loosely in one hand, Tom eases into the liquor store. Maybe not the best part of town for Tom to come  on a random jaunt down to, but here he is - buying liquor, no less. He gravitates towards the long cooler full of beers, wines, and premixed beverages... taking slow, meandering steps, fingers occasionally brushing alongside the cool glass.  Passing Penny and Chase are shopping in the vodka aisle. They're being overtly shadowed by a clerk in an apron because they're the shifty sort around these parts. Shiftier than the college kids by far. "Next week I think," a terse aside. Penny's more focused on the rubber-sole steps moving past them. She watches Tom's back the way people do when they're starstruck or sure, so sure they know that person. Voice low, then, almost a murmur "Heaviest things'll be this," nodding to the cart "shouldn't be too much of an ordeal."  Starting towards the counter now, Chase looks back to conspire with baldy. "Is this it, or wha'?" Bloodshot eyes survey the immediate vicinity, they still haven't hit the dark liquor section. "You got whiskey in there?" He cants his head, stressing the importance of said content. "I'm not goin' to any housewarmin' without whiskey." Note to Penny, don't buy Whiskey.  If Tom knows he's been spotted - or if he's anxious about the possibility of being spotted - he doesn't exactly show it. Just continues his meaningful quest for the right beer across three... now, four, then... five... rows of beer. A halt between Japan and Thailand - the beers are grouped by region, then nation. Towards the end of Japan, he finds a frosted six-pack of Sapporo. He slides the door open, reaches in, hefts up the stylish beers in their stylish paper case. Lets the door slide close on its own - he turns his back on it, walks to the bar... one foot in front of the other, with no particular rush.  She shrugs into a sidelong glance at the frat boys just leaving ahead of them. One of them keeps feeling around his pockets, looking around at the floor, confused but let onward by his unconcerned friends. "S'just the essentials," hands deep in the pockets of her jacket, she pushes the cart forward with her hip keeping a slower pace. The squeaky wheel ribbits out in a predictible pattern as they keep moving, Penny fingering out a sizable fold of bills "I'm supposed to get a receipt for everything. Fucking Steve.. and fucking /Dave/" spitting that name out; rusty nail in her cheerios.  "What're they, writing this shit off?" Chase quips while lending a callused hand to the cause. His cause. Some Bushmill's whiskey is reached for and snuck in with the army of bottles. A fair amount of cash is withdrawn from his pocket and offered up into the frey. "'Ere." That's for Uncle Grampa's finest. Stained teeth start in on the jerky, and tear at the flesh with tensing jaw muscles.  Tom grabs a slim bottle of Grey Goose Vodka with thumb and forefinger off of the end of an aisle. He makes for the line leading to the register... patient, calm. No where in particular to go with all this alcohol. Just making one leisurely stop on the way to some other leisurely stop.  Turning at the register, she tugs the shopping cart behind her and moves to start unloading things. She shakes her head no at the money he offers "Put that away, jesus" lifting out things from the far side onto the tiny little conveyor. There won't be enough room length-wise to get everything all at once; she starts piling the boxed wine "Hey can you get me two more'a these?" She holds two fingers up to Chase, index and middle splayed. "Please?"  Wordless, the thick man turns to run the gauntlet. Chase passes Tom with unblinking red eyes fixed on some vino. Boots thump along, made for terrain much more treacherous than the inside of this store. The two bottles *clink* together as they're pulled from their brothers and sisters.  Nonchalantly, Tom turns sideways for Chase to pass, with nary a glance at him. Brow arched, he looks towards the front of the line... then glances down to read the label on his vodka, head canted to the side. Reading something or the other on the side of the bottle. Another glance up and over.  The beep-beep at the checkout is steady. Machines work. The girl swings the bottles, barcodes down over the infrared without really looking or paying any kind of real attention to the work she's doing; or rather the work the machine is doing. Nobody ever watches the machines; machines are perfect.Perfect until the beep-beep becomes a singular noise-flare. Error. Penny fidgets a little in front of the cashier shen she picks up the intercom, the nasal english-as-a-second-language amplified to reach the entire store and all it's busy employees,  "PRICE CHECK ON THE TALL BLONDE."  Already uncomfortable in her position at the head of the line, now she's holding things up. In a small voice, Penny clears her throat "I think they were on sale." It's the kind of thing everyone says when there's a problem. The cashier just looks at her. And the rest of her items. And pushes a big red button,  "MANAGER TO THE FRONT, PLEASE."  "Shite." Chase curses under his breath as he rejoins baldy and with the two bottles. His nose wrinkles as the manager is called for, and shoulders shift to preemptively spot the overseer. The horse neck of his *cracks* when it's turned a bit too far to one extreme. No flinch on Chase's plain features. "It was on sale..." There's some backup.  Tom glances fixedly at the pair, his interest quite apparent. A gentle lift of his hand readjusts the loose and somewhat sweaty grip on the neck of the vodka bottle, pinched between thumb and forefinger. The six-pack must be killing the circulation of those three fingers he grips it with. Pale eyes scan Chase... skim to Penny. Back to Chase. Tall Blonde on sale, eh...?  Penny drops into defensive mode, deciding that waiting five minutes for the manager to get off his ass shouldn't be in her list of things to do with her evening. "Look it's right there on the shelf," gesturing largely behind her in a grand arc across the whole of the store "on a pink sign. With cut-out stars. It says six for thirty-six. You want me to go get it? I'll get the sign, okay?" The manager still has not appeared. The cashier seems rooted to the spot, a sentry lacking what capacity it takes for enlightened thought. She stares at Penny, nonplussed. "Just wait for the manager." Penny's hands come out of her pockets, thumb and forefingers flex back over her head "Fine, fine" looking at Chase "are they all like this? Shit.." Where is the help? Is the help coming from back there beyond Tom? Looking straight at him, her gaze a lit fuse.  "Fuckin' hell." Grumbling from the gallery, Chase turns again to await the manager, Mr. Snuffaluffagus. His square jaw is still chewing on spiced beef as absent fingers reach up to scratch behind an ear. Red eyes meet pale counterparts, the punk looks in Tom's direction as well. Both expecting help to arrive from the same direction. "Yes, everyone's like 'this'" More chewing, it does take a while to eat those pieces of store bought jerky.  As if feeling some sort of... responsibility for this... the dullness of the clerks, the shrill, shrieking horror of the banal business exchange, the difficulty of capitalist money-for-merchandise exchange in this day and age... Tom glances momentarily away... then back up at the pair, calling over, "I think the sign says it's six for thirty six." A pause. Then, mildly, to no one in particular, "That sounds like quite the deal." He seems to feel he's responding, someow, in a socially appropriate way to some pre-designated cue.  See? /He/ agrees with us," pointing at Tom, she looks back at him but starts in again, a little slower. He dresses the part, fits the role of reasonable and trustworthy much better than Penny or Chase. Modifying her tone with a symapthetic pitch, she turns back to the cashier "Please? Just call the manager. He isn't coming. He'll just tell you to override the thing anyway, come on.  "It /is/ a deal, eh?" the cashier lifts the end of her phrase with that irritating thing half the world thinks Canadians do. But the beep-beeps start again. Progress. Penny's shoulders slump a little; it's over and we're moving on. She turns a little again and mouths 'thanks' to Tom, a guilty ha-ha lingering while the check-out continues.  "Fuck." Chase does like that word, though this time it's seasoned with relief. As the bottles are scanned, the thick punk begins to bag them himself. No more time for cashier bullshit, he even takes precious moments away from chewing on his cured meat. Though his teeth continue working long after his last bite. Bottles into bags, a wonderful trick when it works. Arms begin to gather the bounty, Chase goes about this work with the experience of an ex-check out man. Not possible. "I'll be outside, Cojack..." Boots walk him out towards the exit, having left just enough for Penny to carry without much hindrance.  Drifting closer as the line shortens by way of attrition, Tom lifts his chin in amusement, recognition. "Tremendous..." His eyes dance as they watch Chase dash... then glance on back to Penny, dim with recognition. "Lovely night for it, don't you think? Or are you just stocking up to replenish what was lost on All Saints?" Tom, of course, looks almost identical to that night by the docks.  The total comes to something like a hundred and change, and she pays it without balking. Just hands over some cash from her pocket, fiddling with change. There's a lot of coinage; too much for Penny to really bother with. She tosses it in the 'Help this Sick Dog' bottle - it's the same half-empty/half-full jug you see everwhere on this continent. Everyone knows it's really the tip-jar anyway; there are no sick dogs in the world - only photographers in the Pound before they put the really awful-looking strays down.  The gesture takes the cashier by surprise and the noise makes her jump a little. Penny starts to say something to Chase as he walks out "It's one-seven-four," knowing she won't be able to catch him. She has bottles to wrap and bag, the tags of conversation to keep dangling. She smiles broadly at you, turning newspaper into cushioning barriers, loading the winebottles into a box "Hey," still having herself a private chuckle about the fast one you just helped her pull "oh this? It's for a thing. Me and my friends," explaining "we're moving. It's.." tilting her head that way "Tom, isn't it."  "You and your friends like to celebrate, huh?" Tom finds himself at the head of the line, after what appears to be a reformed hobo in a poorly tailored suit buys a hip-flask of Night Train. Walking to the head of the line, Tom puts the booze down on the counter beside you with an abundance of caution. He got it all the way here, he'd hate to drop it now. Glancing towards you, Tom ventures, "You're the one in the Santana shirt... Penny, wasn't it?"  Penny nods a few times "On the jacket, yes." She tucks another bottle into the box and starts shifting glass around, moving plastic mix-bottles into the groupings. "We're ah," eyes shifted to the ceiling, to the right, back to you "yes. We're like that.Throw parties, do some really high-ener.." The flow of information  interrupted by the beep-beep "...energy stuff. It's" looking you over again "well it might not be your thing but y'never know," trailing off she finished packing up her stuff.  "Jacket," Tom corrects, aloud - as though it might be necessary to a certain mnemonic for placing faces with names, et cetera, et al. The cashier rings up his purchase, and Tom already has his wallet out. Indeed, he's already fishing up the company card out from a pocket. "It might not be my thing," he echos, smiling, "but you never know. You headed there now? I could maybe give you a ride, if you take the train."  "Oh it's not even a done deal yet w..I'm still at the hotel. Someone else is closing on the place.." she starts wrapping the bags around her fists, balancing the box between them "still in its infancy. You know. Budding thing. I'd appreciate the ride though .. I'm no good at maps and directions here. Just haven't gotten used to it yet."  "Sure, sure... where in the city are you?" Tom hands the corporate card over. Not terribly flashy looking, but certainly not exactly his, either. "I'm not very good at, uh... directions, either, really. Or driving, particularly, but I'm learning my way around Toronto, to and fro." The credit card takes care of the currency exchange - no need to fumble out loonies and all those other absurd little fake Canadian currency units. The cash for goods exchange as it was meant to be - automatic, unthinking, invisible. As it's bagged, he leans down to sign a credit slip with a pair of squirmy lines. Pockets the receipt. Slips the card in the wallet. And slips the wallet away.  Penny makes a face, bugs in her soup. "Some toursity-trappish sty," setting the box down to rest on the edge of the check-out stand. She applies the right amout of pressure and leverage, completely confident it won't fall. "They /call/ it a Holiday Inn but /I/ don't think it's anything like the ones back states-side" her opinion of Canadian-run businesses ever evident, maligning "No aye-ch eye would ever go up without at least a dinky little pool or a gym," not that Penny would use them - does she look the sort to use those amenities? "unless it was put up at an airport." She dwells on that into an expectant quiet. Then, "You?" making the exchange complete.  Hefting the loops of the plastic bag cautiously, Tom squints at it rather thoughtfully. Lifts the bag off of the surface of the counter, to make sure the double-bag can hold the wait. "I think I stayed there when I first came in. Do they have a really rotten grill-cheese? They burn the cheese a tiny bit when they leave it on the griddle?" He moves away from the check-out and nods to a fellow who momentarily passes by him.  "And their tomato soup has that annoying half-split parsley sticking out of it? And their soda machines only have that lame generic 'President's Choice' crap" a wry smile  "Yeah, that's the one, hey can you hang on to one of these for me?" Holding out the bag in her left hand. Her fingers have turned purple and white, circulation cut off at strange intervals. It isn't clear whether she wants you to take it so she can just shake life back into her hand or if she means for you to hold it while you both walk out the door to whereever "Hand cramp."  Sympathetic or eager to help or perhaps simply eager to make an impression, Tom grabs up the bag with his free hand. The two bags he is holding are relatively unbalanced in terms of weight, so he has a tendancy to list starboard. "Sure, sure," Tom demurrs, with a half-smile. "Absolutely the one, absolutely. You might have to fold up your knees a teensy bit," he notes, apropos of nothing, "It's only a hatchback."  That Tom isn't patently denying knowing Penny is a little shocking to the Canadian public; but that he's walking out with her? Punk and Conservative? Couldn't be anything stranger-looking in this town. "Thanks," flattening her hand out, flexing and bending fingers into their normal pink color toward the exit "I'm sure it'll be just fine" and when she says "..been in worse things than a hatchback," you can believe it's true.  Rather unimpressed by whatever scrutiny is given him, Tom walks right out with you. "It's a pretty rotten little Geo Metro," he grins, "Built right around the turn of the century." Slow footsteps on dry pavement, and he's aimed for the white Geo Metro along the curb. He walks up alongside the back of the car - putting the bag on the ground, fetching his key, working the trunk open.  "Wow, that's a real 'tique" investing a subtle and ironic tone to the conversation "I can't remember the last time I saw one of these.. grade school, maybe?" Her low whistle is quicky and smarmy but of course well-timed so as not to offend or put-off. She tramps along the side of the car, poises her bags and box for loading "Where'd you find a thing like this up here?"  "Used car lot. It's a weird design... it only has three pistons, so it doesn't use very much gasoline. I figure that's a plus. And it came cheap, so I bit for it." He lifts the bag into the trunk, which is unusually tidy. A roadside assistance kit, a box full of books, a crowbar to the side, a spare tire probably lurking, regularly checked, beneath the little trunk-rug. Reaching out, he makes to assist with the loading of booze into the back of the truck.  "Three pistons, yeah," hefting the box into your hands, shimmeying it to fit just so "but no get up and move, y'know? It's kind of a fa" Glancing to your hands, briefly "family car. Sensible, safe. Economical," these things she says with the kind of animosity only a real driving enthusiast could harbor for those kinds of qualities "but where's the /fun/." Penny grins, all teeth, mostly to herself eyeing the box of books casually, packing the trunk with the rest of her purchases.  "Sort of, yeah, sort of," Tom demurrs, with a reluctant little sigh. "I mean, yeah. But it's a light little car, and man, it really -takes off-, sometimes. It doesn't need that much go. /I/ don't need that much go." Tom laughs, bolstered now: "I don't really think I'm a good enough rider to handle a lot of go. This is about as much go as I'm comfortable with." He makes sure the 'supplies' are secure, then slams the trunk closed.  "You could be. You never know," dusting her hands off on the front of her pants, observing the lines of the car. Something. Maybe the color, the paint, some unseen focal point. " Are we ready to go then?" Penny walks around to the passenger's side and waits for the dull sound. The familiar unlocking click all car doors make. "And you're almost sure of where we're going..."

      Brief scene - we learn the Opposition has eyes in the mermaid as we always suspected. Left relabeled thing #1 there.  The rich aroma from Starbucks draws you in. Starbucks(#547RIJM)  Always with the morning hours and the coffee, Penny shoulders her way in past suits and skirts, a halo of truly toxic smoke wreaths - meant to keep others away. Does it's job, that and the the withering half-lidded, puffy-eyed squint clears her a path toward the back. Between little chairs and little tables meant for little conversation, Penny looms - some gigantic figured cut from a different picture and pasted in at odd angles. Her hand flattens on someone's stray tabloid and drags it off the table toward Alyx's sofa, crusts of sugar and drink-stirs falling behind her. "Shove over, hey?"  Obligingly moving over on the sofa, Alyx smiles up at her new companion. "Heyo," she greets cheerfully. "How's things, Delightful?" Her own drink is almost gone - decaf coffee, by the smell of it. If one can smell through the fumes, that is.  One can not tell. One is still sleep-walking. "Just penny," speaking in code, rubber soles squeaking on the tiles, she turns and shoves herself into the corner of the couch kicking aside stray chairs that "people never push in, no manners man, /that/'ll be the end of civilization. Feel like the dregs" making faces at some unexamined grime beneath her nails "Comps got confirmation for the group so now we're puttin'somethin'together. Daze put out the word, yeah?"  Then, "Funny how we haven't heard from anyone else."  "Group? Daze hasn't mentioned anything to me?" Alyx prompts. "What would the group do, exactly, Penny?" As she speaks, Alyx makes an odd gesture with one hand, finger lifted to her lips as she glances 'upwards'.  Dunce comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. Dunce has arrived. Dunce walks in and joins the line before the counter.  Penny shrugs herself further into her jacket, looking at Alyx, her cigarette smoke ever lifting. She reaches out a hand to a table, out of place and nearer to the couch than normal and plucks an ashtray from it, looking upward. Smoke hiccups and coughs out through her nose, one brow raised archly. "From the man," whoever the man is "got word on the next gig. Daze didn't tell you? God.  F'y'can't invite your friends what good is it?" She reaches a hand inside her jacket, extracting a 3x5. Bright colors, shiney slicky "Pay's good and we're totally on it but I'ma play low, Kid'll play high, Piggy's on lights.. comin'together." "Sweet," Alyx murmurs, eyeing the painfully yellow flyer. "If you need a hand with anything, gimme a shout," she adds, stuffing the flyer into her bag. "I'm only a general dogsbody, mind, but still. Many hands make light work, and all that shit."  Dunce pays for a large cup of coffee, and starts sweeping the cafe with his eyes, looking for a good spot.  Penny lifts her ass off the couch without getting up, tugs something else out of her backpocket. "Solid, girl" Timepiece tapped at it "Hey, you got the time? Never reset this. . . " trailing off a little "I need to get back soon I think - it eight yet?"  Checking her own watch, Alyx notes, "Yeah. Five past. Better run, Penny." She seems amused at that, finishing her coffee and adding, "Or just take a leisurely stroll."  Lurching off the couch, Penny winds the watch foward, leaving the tabloid behind "Call you later, let you know when we're heading out," then she breaks into an inexplicable run. Must be late. Penny tugs something from her pocket, arcs it into a trashcan and bangs out the door.

      Meeting, part 2 -- after Compton left.  Pretty uneventful.  Compton steps back out to the main hall. Compton has left. Hana has, by this time, sat down on the floor. She seems to be leaning against the wall, asleep, unless one is observant enough to catch the slight crack of her eyelids, through which she could be watching. Keene steps forward to allow Compton to walk past him, not even looking at him when he leaves. His attention moves to Siomen; he smiles thinly at him, but then moves his attention back to Jonah. "I realize this, Magister. I believe in you, as I am sure all the other magi in this city do. But it takes time for my colleagues to learn to trust others. They have difficulty dealing with the rest of the Traditions at times because of their methods. Thus, I have found myself in the role of leader because of my ability to negotiate and explain their actions to others." Rhiamon's hand stays up. Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon, "... difference." Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, "... their..." Paksenarrion enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Paksenarrion has arrived. Paksenarrion makes her way in from the main chamber, a long slender bundle wrapped in black cloth is slung over a shoulder. Alexandre shakes his head at Rhiamon's reply, looking like he doesn't believe her. Jonah continues to listen, then nods. "Very well." He looks to Rhiamon. "Miss Jones?" Keene, when his turn has passed again, returns to being seate. Rhiamon lets her hand drop, not showing the ring this time. "I am glad to see Aaron Michaels here, but perhaps his position could be elucidated ? There seem to be some things going on that I have no knowledge of..." Abel looks over at Rhiamon, then over to Aaron. A crooked grin comes to Alex's face at the mention of Aaron's presence and he shakes his head slightly. Jonah nods, "His position is currently under review. I shall announce more information when it is decided and appropriate." He looks about to the others, "Now, for those who aren't part of a Cabal, please raise your hands." James raises his hand. Abel takes a quick look over to Chase to see his reaction. Rhiamon shrugs, and settles down. She'll ask Aaron later. Jonah guestures to James, "Yes.. Mr... Anderson?" Alyx lifts a gloved hand, the other resting on the table in front of her. Abel turns his look over to James. He fingers his Sun symbol unconsciously. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, "... fulfils... about the..." James says, "You said earlier that thos of us who aren't part of a caball would still be allowed access to the realm and the chantry if we expressed interest in being affiliated with this organization. I am James anderson, and I would like to do so." Keene returns to writing on his legal pad, taking notes on the proceedings. Alexandre smiles briefly at Rhiamon, nodding slightly. Hana doesn't raise her hand, but she seems alert again. Jonah looks back over his shoulder, at Rhiamon and Alexandre. He gives her a half-smirk and says, "Thank you, Miss Jones, Mr. Taylor. I try very hard." With that said, he looks back to James. "Yes, I did indeed say that. I will take note of you. What Tradition are you, Mr. Anderson?" Aaron raises his hand as well and smirks. James replies simply, "Verbena" Jonah notes that, then continues. "Very well. Thank you." He looks to Alyx. "Miss Davian, I will record your name and Tradition. Do you have anything you wish to say?" Alex looks over to Aaron when he raises his hand, but then turns his head to look over at Hana, without waiting to see what it is that Aaron is going to say. "I would prefer to remain affiliated with the Chantry," Alyx murmurs. "Though at the present time, I do not know the goals and unifying purposes of the Cabals here, so joining one will be difficult." Abel looks over to Alyx, trying to catch her eye, and mouths silently to her 'Talk to me later.' He smiles. Jonah nods to Alyx. He writes some notes, then looks over to Aaron. "Yes, Mr. Michaels?" Abel turns in his chair so he can see Aaron. Alexandre looks over towards Aaron as he speaks. The same curiosity that provoked Rhiamon's question is evidently on his face as well. Jesyca looks over towards Abel and then Aaron and back towards her cloak and continues fidgeting with it. Abel looks down at Jes curiously Aaron rises softly, 'I was once considered a member of the Virtual Adepts...while I came back willingly to this venue...as my choices are limited to a single cabal I have no interest in...I will decline joining a cabal...". Plain and simple speech from one usually so volatile at these meetings. He flairs his longcoat and settles back down. Abel whispers to Jesyca. Paksenarrion slides into a sitting position on the floor with her back to the wall, looking about the room and quietly listening to the meeting. Jesyca's green eyes blink a few times and she freezes for a moment. She turns her head up towards Abel and offers a bit of a smile, shaking her head lightly. Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, "... I'd..." Alex's head turns slightly, a sideways glance at Aaron, and then further to look at Chase. A curious eyebrow is raised, as he wonders how Chase will respond to this. Abel also turns to see Chase's reaction to this statement. Chase has been silent till now. "Micheals, this is not the forum for that discussion. Unless you'd like me to inform the entire room of your misdeeds?" Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon, "... trust..." Alyx lifts her hand once more, remaining silent. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre. Paksenarrion raises her hands as well, quietly waiting her turn. Jonah watches Aaron for a moment, "As Mr. Kettle has stated, this is not the forum for that particular discussion. We will discuss that after this meeting is over." He looks to Alyx. "Go ahead, Miss Davian." Aaron looks to Chase, 'Only if you're willing to share your screwups as well, Kettle...I'll be happy to tell them the ones I know...and submit to the lie detection you won't..". He again leans back and puts his feet up. Chase remains silent as Jonah backs his words. He smiles slightly, and like the slow rise of a bean-stock, his middle finger extends towards Aaron. "Once this meeting is ajourned, Guru, I would ask that if there are any of questionable loyalty within our midst, that their activities be made known to all. There is little that brings a Chantry to it's knees faster than strife on the inside." Here, Alyx nods to both Aaron and Chase. "We all have our stories to tell, gentlemen." Alex rocks his chair back on it's rear legs as he kicks his feet up to rest crossed on the back of the chair in front of him. Time to get comfy for the first match of the evening. Jesyca's cheeks flush Crimson at Chase's display and glue back down upon her cloak once more. Keene has no particular reaction to Chase's `outburst', if a hand gesture can be considered one. Instead, he continues taking notes. Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon. Rhiamon shrugs to Alexandre. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, "so..." Jonah merely nods to Alyx, "I will consider this, Miss Davian. For now, I want to finish this meeting." He looks to Paksenarrion. "You are... Miss.. Johnathan? No, perhaps you would be so kind as to introduce yourself." Abel listens to and watches aaron and chase and just shakes his head with a sigh. Alexandre lets out a sudden, dark chuckle at Rhiamon's last statement. Siomen sits quietly and listens, he glances over at Geero and tilts his head as he spots the new chain. Paksenarrion coughs and stands up, pushing a small braid out of her face, "I am Paksenarrion Johanson.. Of the Celestial Chorus.." She gives Jonah a deep nod, almost a bow, "I wished to add my name to the list of affiliation of the chantry please. Of the cabals currently represented, one I would not feel truly part of.. The others.." She glances towards Aaron and Chase, then around a little, "I will not serve.. I would however be happy to lend my skills to the chantry itself and aide others as the need arises." Abel blinks at Paksens words, looking at her inquizzitively. James looks thoughtfull. Jonah nods. "Very well. Duely noted." He takes a moment to glance around one last time. "I do believe that we have recorded everyone," his eyes stop on Hana, "save you, Miss Kawakami. Do you wish to be affiliated with us?" "I don't know," Hana says, slowly unfolding her limbs, legs and arms, as she rises. "I don't really know what that means." Alex raises a hand, speaking before aknowledged. "Kaze, Kasui and myself will work with Hana so that she can determine if and where she fits with the Chantry," he offers. Hana twists a little, to look towards Alex studiously, followed by a brief glance at Kaze. She doesn't say anything else for the moment. Jonah nods, then offers a brief smile. "Very well. I shall allow you time to learn what it means and then consider the offer." He takes a few more notes, collects his papers, and begins putting them away. "I will compile this list and complete it. Everyone shall soon receive a letter which shall acknowledge your request. As of now, however, this meeting is officially adjourned. We will have another meeting ten days hence (One RL Week). The agenda of that meeting will be on the board. You are all dismissed." He begins packing his things. Jonah adds, quietly, "Oh, Mr. Kettle, Mr. Hess, Mr. Michaels, Mr. Shinketsu, Mr. Elison, please stay after the meeting." Rhiamon stands, and moves towards Aaron, then halts as Jonah speaks.. Aaron doesn't move from his spot in the Gallery, though he smiles, 'Detention again...too many spitballs.." Alyx rises slowly from the Seat of Entropy, brushing her shirt down and tugging her coat into place before beginning to cross the room towards Abel. Rhiamon moves over, she can talk to him first. Abel nods to Jonah and remains seated, then turns to Jes. Jesyca bites on her bottom lip a bit and looks up towards Abel. Abel squeezes Jes's hand and smiles at her. "I'll see ya later?" Siomen yawns and stands, he moves over to Rhiamon and smiles as he pats Geero on the head. He looks at Rhiamon "Hope he was not too much trouble?" Hana watches a moment longer, then slips out the door. Rhiamon whispers to Aaron, "Want to... what's..." Hana steps back out to the main hall. Hana has left. Alex remains in his seat, leaning back on the rear legs, with his heels on the back of the chair in front of him. Chase now stands, chewing on the same piece of gum with same fervor he has been along. And despite the fact his stained teeth must've long since driven out every morsel of sugar, he's still enjoying it. His stance is mainly to stretch, as it's apparent he's not heading towards the door. Shoulders flex, producing a crack, as his thich arms wave in circles. Rhiamon looks back and smiles at Siomen, "He's never any trouble.." Aaron whispers to Rhiamon, "... or..." Jesyca gives a bow of her head towards him and smiles, "Of course." She then lifts up from the ground, and keeps her cloak closed about her body. Alyx approaches Abel, stepping into place beside him, though not saying anything. Arms cross over her chest, the woman simply waiting for something. Aaron replies to Rhiamon as he gets up to move to where the table is Keene makes a few more notes on his legal pad, then puts his pen away in his breast pocket. He picks up his notepad, slides it into his coat, and rises, heading out with everyone else. Rhiamon ouches, but quickly hugs Aaron. "Luck" Abel turns to Alyx and smiles. "Can we talk later? I think The Beacon in the Dark may offer you a place with us, but I need to talk with the others. I know I'd like to see you Join. We have similar goals I think." Alexandre remains seated where he is, thinking. Considering. He slides his seat away from the table, though. Aaron smiles and hugs Rhiamon back and replies, 'SKill.." "You have my cellphone number, brother," Alyx murmurs quietly to Abel. "Call me when you have finished here, and we can talk then." Rhiamon laughs. Siomen smiles as he moves to take back Geero "Whats this?" he inspects the necklace "You going to keep care of that Geero?" Rhiamon turns to Siomen, "He better " but smiles. "I thought he deserved an ornament.." Abel nods to Alyx. Alyx heads for the exit, filtering out silently. James gets up and makes his way out. Alyx steps back out to the main hall. Alyx has left. James steps back out to the main hall. James has left. Paksenarrion stretches a little and shoulders her burden, looking about once more before deciding which way to go.. Kaze sits quietly, unmoving in the Seat of Mind waiting for the post meeting discussion to begin. Aaron walks over to the table and uses the unoccupied seat of time to get up and walk on the table, settling himself cross-legged in the middle of it You step back out to the main hall.

      Downtown - Jarvis and Dundas(#131RJ)       Empty lots and undeveloped plots of useless land fill this intersection. Old, largely-abandoned factories are set up along the streetside. Development here ceased long ago, apparently. Two major homeless shelters operate in this area, given its rather cheap real-estate value. The area is mostly populated by homeless people, junkies and whores, though the occasional employee of the few operating companies in this area might be seen driving through... generally rapidly.  Contents: Compton Billboard In Front of the Vacant Lot   Obvious exits:   The Co-Op cab pulls up to the curb, and the rear door pops open and Compton hauls his mass out of the back seat of the old Caprice. Handing a $20 and a $5 over the seat to the Jamaican driver, letting him keep whatever change there is... not that there was any offered to begin with.  Penny grouses on the way out the door, bitches while you hail a cab, whining the whole time "I don't wanna, we can go somewhere else, let's get coffee okay? Coffee? I want breakfast. I'm hungry" no she isn't, she's uneasy "look I'll buy, okay? Just.." Kind of a pathetic stream of conciousness. Penny gets out of the cab with Compton's help. "Help." He practically has to drag her out of the backseat.  Unnusually garbed, for her at least, Alyx happens to already be at the vacant lot, looking as if she's either in dire need of chocolate, or contemplating murder.  Compton retrives a satchel from the back seat along with Penny, and gives her an an annoyed look, "Quit yer bitchin, a'right?" he gruffly returns to Penny. The satchel is bulky and looks to weight about half of what Penny does. Looking serious and burdened.  Penny is a pain in the ass. She starts to wave the taxi back toward them, stepping out into the middle of the road "HEY?" arms in the air "Come back!" The shouting she does winds her, bends her forward. She looks suddenly like she's run a great distance, head turned slightly to the side. Cars start honking at her, swerving out of the way.  After hauling Penny to her feet, Compton undoes one strap fo the bag, and pulls a large Saporo can out. This thing is a canon of a beer can. At least 4 liters with a screw on cap and a large handle on one side to facillitate ease of drinking, and with a grimiace he thrusts it towards Penny, "There. Brekkie." he adds.  "PENNY! Fuck head, get back here." Compton yells as she bolts from his offering and in to oncomming traffic, far fast than someone of Comptions size and girth could move, so he starts to make his way across the street to gather Penny and move closer to the vacant lot.  Glancing over at the shout, Alyx notes Penny's odd antics, beginning to head after the woman herself. Not encumbered as much as Compton is, she manages /not/ to get herself knocked down by oncoming cars as she heads across the road in persuit.  Busted on all sides, Penny stays put but looking to the opposite side of the street indicating there. Let's go there. Away from the fence. Yeah? Maybe? No. She just waits for Compton to come get her, only noticing Alyx just then. Doesn't smile or anything, isn't in much of a mood as she is in a state.  Compton waddles up on Penny's side , and armpits the beer and grabs her under her arm and just keeps on hauling, not saying anything at this point. Just a look of determined pissed-offness stamped on his mug at this point.Opting to follow the pair, in case Penny decides to make another dash, Alyx fiddles with her gloves until they sit comfortably.  You say, "Fine, she can be overheard saying angrily, "I'll take the BUS back. Look I was just here the other night. Isn't like shit's changed all that much and Keene says we can't" wrenching her arm back, clearly not intending to run again, continuing her rant sotto voce - nigh on a hiss "just go all gangbusters so I SAID I wouldn't so what're we supposed to be doing?"  Reaching the sidewalk, and relative safety from radiator grill smooching in to you Compton releases Penny arm, and drops the satchel to the pavement roughly, "Look," he starts all pissed off like, "Fuck off, kay? Got a job to do here, right?" Yeah, he's grumpy, he's always grumpy. But this time it is different. This isn't a hangover bitch, but a focused more professional twisting of the knickers. "We're just gonna take a look, get some readings and fuck off right?"  Compton notices Alyx finally, and addsa simple nod with a 'Hi.' tacked on to his Penny rant.  "And what /is/ your job here?" Alyx inquires dryly, stood behind the pair. "If it's about the site, I could probably tell you a /bit/."  Compton inclines his head towards the fence and answers, "Wanna see what's makin all the bad karma in there... Penny says there's somthing riping up the dimensional divide in there."  Penny whips around and looks at Alyx like - would she be pitching such a fit if she didn't have a good-enough reason? She uses Compton for a leaning post, holding her right hand to her stomach, belching something foul behind him "Old man, you really need to work on your mixers."  "Node," Alyx quips, ever-so softly. "That's why Hyperion want it. Could be that's what's causing the 'divide'."  Compton hrms handing the beer canon to Penny again, and peering throught the chain links, "No, I don't think that's it... Penny said there was 'somthing' in there now... somthing new. As of last night."  What the hell. Penny takes the can from Compton and chases whatever she had before with it. Ask any alcoholic, beer's good for the soul. Her attitude improves some, but her mood's still dark as tar "Stuff's dying," tacking something meaningful in there for Alyx "it's all messed up, chaos." In between pulls, Penny hides the can in the big sleeves of her jacket. What open container, officer?  [OOC] Alyx says "Are you calling Staff on this, to see what we find out?" [OOC] Compton was thinking that. [OOC] Penny says "Sure, wave at Cassius?" [OOC] Compton says "Yup." [OOC] Alyx pages 'im. Compton pages: Excuse me Mr. Cassius. We lil mages are poking around the Hyperion site, wanna play? [OOC] Alyx snickers. Compton pages: I'm hoping to gather some info of the 'thing' in the site right now. Photos, readings maybe hands on inspection if I get brave enough. Compton pages Cassius, Penny, and Alyx: Sounds great. //.etro: Cassius will be joining your location. Cassius has arrived. [OOC] Penny says "Oi Cassius :)" [OOC] Cassius says "Oi!"  Compton Penny and Alyx are standing out of the site. Compton has a bag of pseudo techno-gadgets with him.  Penny's got a beer up her sleeve and a puss on her face.  Long distance to Cassius: Penny es'plains: Saw the big machine land the other night. Went to talk to the spirits and all I got was a headful of noise (spirits screaming in agony, dying) so I told the guys, took the night off and now we're back. Against Penny's better judgement.  From afar, Cassius nods. From afar, Cassius knows what's here and mostly knows what's going on. You paged Cassius with 'Rock.'.  "So? Ya got any info like that" Compton asks Alyx, refering back to Penny rather broken description of events last night.  Alyx shakes her head at Compton. "Nope. Don't come by here much. All I know is what was said at Cixi's little party. Going in, or doing this remotely?"  Compton says, "Lemme scan first to be safe. Would perfer not to BnE if I don't have to."  [OOC] Cassius needed to check the jnotes. :)  "I'm not goin'back in there. Fuck no, they got security." Penny backs off a few steps, gets a little air and knocks back more of that beer. "Saw them arrest coupla kids the other night for trespassin'."  With that Compton unbuckles the straps of his satchel and rummages inside, nodding to Penny, "I'da guessed as much. Don't worry toots."  Alyx leans back a little, watching Compton begin to look through his gadgets, deferring to the man's lead for now.  Penny holds out her free hand, knowing Compton'll give her something useful to do sooner or later. "I'm worried, okay?" Looking up and down the block at the junkies fixing, the homeless gathering here and there, lumps on the street "I'm really fucking worried."  Compton pulls out two baton like objects. Made of a maglite type flashlight with a couple of gizzmos duct tapped to the sides and where the light bulb would be housed. Standing he extends one of the tubes to Alyx and says, "Here lady, take this and walk over there a few feet.." he asks her, pointing to Alyx's left and then turns and hands Penny the other one that she was already expecting and points to her right, "Over there."  "It's 'Alyx', Comp," Alyx corrects, though does walk as directed. "Not 'lady'. God forbid I ever act like a lady."  Penny sticks the flashlight in the back pocket of her jeans and starts walking off, hands shoved in her pockets. She shuffles slowly, zipping up her jacket and raising the hood, blending easily into the crowd. The further away from the fence, the better is Penny's theory. Just a few more steps and she's warming her hands over a pharmaceutical-bin fire pit, handing the can of beer off to the nearest body.  "Alyx." Compton says simply as a form of appology, and returns to the bag, producing this time a Polaroid camera that seems to be mounted on the end of a rifle stock and scope. The old style Polaroids, (which he most likely picked up off some venders junk heap in the St. Laurence market) and his rusty, trusty Ether Goggles... some hackneyed gadgets you just can't get rid of it seems.  "So what, we just stand here?" Alyx prompts, holding her tube up and watching Compton curiously.  Compton says, "Um, yeah." He says as if it was obvious, "Over your head and point it in there." Compton adds pointing towards the vacant lot."  Compton with no thought to how odd this is starting to look, dons the Ether Goggles making him look truely absurd. Maybe if it wasn't for the shirt he'd be okay, but that's just not the way it is. Next he lines up the sights on the weird Polaroid-rifle thingy and points it out in to the Vacant Lot, getting as close to the fence as he can.  Laughing with the small group, Penny relates some anecdote with wide gestures. Pulling the rod from her pocket, they shrink back a little "No no, it's not a gun" letting them see it. They pass it around, taking turns pointing it at the fence, trying to turn it on. When it comes back around to her, Penny bangs it a few times in her palm and she too, points it at the fence.    Compton says "Okay, well - the magick part: Matter/Spirit spell. Looking to capture images of the matter and ephemera inside the lot. Going to take 5 picutres. Results depending on the rolls I guess."  Alyx lifts her tube as high as she can, this a little difficult for the 5'2" woman, but managing to get it poked over the fence anyway.    Cassius says "Okie dokie. Page me the PAT."  'PHENOMENON: The local junkies if they are together enough will see the three of us with odd gagets. The two 'flashlights' look inert and project no visible light. The Polaroid-gun just looks odd, but simply spits out 4x4 photos.'.  'ACTION: The two ladies pointing etherically charged maglites in to the coumpound, and Compton with his mounted Polaroid with Etherically senitive film he's made on his own, snapping shots off at the fresh construction site.'.  'THEORY: The Ether-lights are projecting a form of light in to the lot. The polaroid with it's sensetive film will work much like Infrared Cameras work, but on hardcopy and not monitors. The concept is that the Etheric engergy is going to resonate off both solid matetr and ectoplasmic material rendering it visable on the film.'.  Compton steadies himself against the fence and concentarates through the viewpiece.  //.etro: Compton rolls "intelligence+occult" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). Compton frowns...          ... looks up, removes the lense cap and tries again. "Keep 'em up there ladies."  [OOC] Penny snarks her soda. shit. [OOC] Penny snarfs, too. dang.  //.etro: Compton rolls "intelligence+occult" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Compton grins, and starts pulling the trigger snapping off shots.  //.etro: Compton rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 0 success(es).  Somthings wrong. The polaroids arn't developing. Compton starts swearing under his breath, makes a couple adjustments, and lines back up.  //.etro: Compton rolls "arete" at diff 4          For a total of 1 success(es).  Finally, Compton seems to get it all right. Saving what little technical dignity he has left. The 4x4 pieces of film shoot out of the camera in to a clever little hopper basket he has rigged up at the front.  Compton finishes with his impromptu photo shoot. Collecting the snapshots from the basket, he raises his goggles up on to the great expanse of forehead, and takes a gander.  Cassius pages: Ok. Specifically the picture shows what appears to be a large spacecraft. The name on the side reads: ACTIUM. I'll let Escalus know that you were looking."  Cassius goes home. Cassius has left.  Assuming the work is done, Alyx drifts back over to Compton, looking curious.  Penny shuffles back toward Compton, flipping him the maglight "Catch." Her homeless friends don't bother following, working on the beer she gave them. "So. Happy now?"  Compton pockets the snapshots and puts the camera away, then goes and picks up the maglites from where the one was dropped, and the other was thrown when he failed to even try to catch it. "Well, it's a start. Can show Keene and the others these, and maybe with the right spectral anaysis get some more from them. I think you're right though, it's time to split."  "Let's go get you some breakfast." Compton adds, in a pale attempt at making up for dragging you out here.  You say, "Good. Thank you. Okay then, let's go." She raises her hand out to the street, but any attempt to get a cab in this part of town seems pretty thin. "Nah, I just wanna go back to the room and sleep. Still not feeling right."  Compton nods "Alright." points westwards, "There's a TTC stop a few blocks this way." and shoulders his bag moving off.

        Keene enters the apartment.  Compton is working on some brew in the bathroom and just like he said, Penny's zoned out, tucked into one of the beds. Within her arm's reach are a number of things; a notepade, the tv remote and a glass full of something brown and disgusting. She doesn't stir but mumbles into the drool on her pillow.  Keene slides the card into the door, steps into the room, and closes the door behind him. He sets the various locks accordingly. Then, slowly, he moves to his desk, putting down his legal pad and pen by his laptop, then moves back to the door to hang up his coat in the `to be laundered' queue. Coat off, things sorted out, he takes off his shoes, puts them in the annex next to the bathroom door, and moves to the desk, opening up his laptop. He proceeds to transcribe all of his notes into his computer in Enochian. It's going to take him a while to become civil enough to not start using Ars Mentis as a blunt instrument against Compton.  ..and the small plastic garbage pail from bathroom. Penny's hand flops around for it's edge, picks it up some and lifts her head. An awful, heavy rattle passes for breath from her too slow to be normal. The blankets are kicked off suddenly, no longer trapped in the tangle, she sits upright and retches into the pastic-liner, coughing out in breaks of three. Senseless babble errupts from some deeper region, Penny's voice hoarse.  Keene keeps working. Out of a sense of courtesy, he avoids looking over at the retching going on behind him. That, and he wants to be sure he transcribes every detail before he decides to scream at Compton for most of the evening.  Penny gets out of bed and shuffles to the bathroom, shouldering-open the door. The smell of bleach, ammonia and salt-water escapes into the room. Compton's probably doing his best to keep himself underwraps, the tinkle of glass and metal kept to a minimum. Underneath it all; the low rumble of the shower turned to full-blast. Mostly there's no conversation happening. About twenty minutes later she's out again in that cheap-looking chinese robe. Penny's barely got her shit together, wobbling back to bed, but at least she's clean. "Ke," a dry hello.  "DTs?" asks Keene, finishing up typing his notes. He saves his work, then closes his notebook and slides his memo pad underneath it. "SARS going around again or something?"  You say, "I wish," tying up the loose ends of the garbage bag "fucken DTs pass, y'know?" A stomach rumble suggests there's nothing left, air roiling. "Some," interrupting her own flow, gulping down the disgusting brown stuff "something happened last night."  Keene turns on his chair to look towards Penny as she goes back to the couch, looking at her intently. "Something happened?" he asks. "What happened?" She only pauses a minute to burp, then regaining better control of her voice "I saw Their machine land at the vacant lot. I was off my ass on that crap from Pobble just wandering. I heard it first." All the talking stops then, closing her eyes to get steady. She belches again and the dry heaves start.  Keene grouses. He's never been able to mask the queasiness he gets around people being violently sick very well. Even Keene has his weak spots. He idly rests his hand on his stomach. "You mean the Technocracy landed something somewhere?" he asks. "This must have been some sort of Umbra thing -- that's why I didn't hear anything about it."  "Breathe, Penny" comes the voice of wisdom from the bathroom.  Penny opens her mouth and does that deep-breathing thing that hyperventilating people do. She makes a kind of groaning noise, whining "The hell did you give me..." Planting her feet on the carpet, she leans elbows to knees and poises herself over the garbage bin. Just in case. "Yeah. /Yeah/. Bugged the shit out of me. Thought it was some side-effect'a the dose but this buzzing just got louder and louder. So I followed it and saw it land and then," voice cracking, like she might cry "there was this horrible sound. They were scre-eh-ehming for help."   "They said it has to be destroyed."  Keene grits his teeth. This is the kind of situation Keene knows would happen, sooner or later; a threat would arise that the Invisible College would know about but the rest of the community would not, and action would have to be taken before terrible consequences could come about. If they hadn't already. But how do you fight a Technocratic eating machine?  "What is it doing, Penny?" he asks, trying to keep his voice even and soothing despite the sinking feeling in his gut.  Penny ah-ahs, fighting off the urge to vomit again. She swallows and grinds a fist into her side, leaning to it; a distraction from the nausea. "It's swallowing anything that gets near it. It," spitting bile into the plastic bag, chewing the insides of her cheeks "I saw it. It's acting like a black hole, Keene. Everything, everything, everything.. and I saw them, and that woman. She walked in like she couldn't feel it.. "  "Which woman?" asks Keene. "Who was it, Penny?"  You say, "Shahai. The one that set up that public meeting in the arena. I know it," hiccuping "I know it was her."  "Cixi," mutters Keene. "I knew it. Typical egomaniacal Technocrat ... I bet she doesn't even know what kind of ecological havoc this kind of thing will wreak. Or if she does ..." He looks down, gripping the back of his chair. "If she does, we're in a lot more trouble than I thought we were in. And none of the so-called magi around here have a clue."  Penny buckles again and heaves into the bag. "And," reaching for the tissue box, she blows her nose "the spirits can't help. Can barely get them to talk to me." Clearing her sinuses again Penny leans back, taking longer pauses "Felt like a migration in reverse, like a great going-against. They're dying. She killing them - what's it supposed to do?"  Keene gets up, pacing around in his usual oval-shaped path. He runs his hands over his scalp, trying to keep focused. "Kill them," he says. "There's no other reason for that machine to act like it does. It's a Gilgul machine. It's a mechanical door to Oblivion." He fishes his flask out of his coat and takes a hard pull from it, following it up with a handful of something from his right slacks pocket. "Christ almighty. Why don't they just open a controlled portal to Malfeas and get it over with?"  "Funny," coughing out a bitter laugh "she left that part out of the press release." Penny, always finding the humor. "Does it have an off button? or do we have to send it through it's own portal to get rid of it.." either option none too appealing, she cringes. Pulls on a sweatshirt over her robe, still shuddering. "I need a cigarette," she say but really means I want to leave this fucking city.  "Can do," says Keene. He walks over to Penny and gives him one of his cigarettes, even going as far as to light her with his black Masonic-logo Zippo. "I have no mad Flambeau skills to blow shit up. We can't ask the loa to help us because they don't want to go anywhere near it. I don't see us having a lot of options internally."  Penny puffs, the cigarette bobbing around as she talks "Do we have a time limit? I mean like.. before it fucks shit up permanently? ..not just me with the getting sick and all.." Each draw turns her a different shade of green; some side-effect of Doctor Compton's Spiritual Hangover Cure-all. "I mean you're right.. outside of some stupid bait and switch tricks I can't do shit, god I don't think I could get anywhere near there again without getting ill. We need to pow-wow."  Keene walks back to the desk and sits down, putting his hands on his knees. "We do," he says. "I don't know if it's even too late or not, but we have to do something."  Penny moves like she might put her head back down on the pillow. Her hands slide around, searching for something in the wrinkled mass of cotton and fleece. She pulls out a pair of cargos and a t-shirt "So should I get dressed or what? You think we can do anything tonight?"  "Probably not," says Keene. "The jackasses had their meeting today. They've all left by now to go sodomize each other or whatever those other filthy hippies do because they don't study worth a damn." He takes out his flask again and takes a long hit.  Penny tosses the clothes into the heap at the end of the bed. "Shit" is all she says. Burning off another lifetime of smoke, she waves it in zag before crawling back under the sheets and blankets making like to go back to sleep. Tipping the cigarette into the remains of the brown gunk in the glass, it flares out and sends up a single wisp. Tossing around, punching the endlessly flat pillows Penny thrashes. "Fuck."  Keene sits in silence. He internalizes his frustration; he's good at it.  Penny's fit peaks when she kicks the covers off again. Flat on her back, she stares at the ceiling and talks to the paint "We could do *something*. I've been here all day, all night sick to my stomach and doing *nothing*. Anything. Anything besides this," pushing her head into the pillows, punctuating "This is so not us."  "I would rather act like people who are alive than people who the Technocracy have shot dead," says Keene. "If we run into this thing without some sort of plan of action, we'll be torn apart. As it is, we don't have many friends in the local Tradition community, so we'd have very few places to run if it went south. You can't be a martyr if nobody misses you."   "I hate you."  Penny probably means that very sincerely given the moment but probably doesn't mean it in the truest sense of the phrase. There's a certain malaise in the delivery; the ghost of exhaustion beating futile drums in her syllables.  Keene opens back up his notebook, activating Word. He starts to work on processing a document. "Go to sleep, Penny," is his advice.  You say, "I need pills to sleep. Give me pills."  Keene reaches into his coat, produces a orange cylinder from Rite Aid, and lobs it overhand at Penny's bed. "Valium. A little dab'll do you."  Penny waits for the prescription bottle to fall on the bed somewhere, her energy-level sinking. She rattles out a few pills, swallows them dry. "Thissen," reaches over to the nightstand, places the bottle there and tosses back the rest of the water "I had an idea. Me'n Daze. We can do something. Call'r." Concious deep-breathing going on now, she pulls the covers back on and stretches out.

      Ruins of Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber       This chamber used to be vast, even more so than the remains of the hall outside. Amidst all the rubble marring its ancient perfection is an almost perfectly preserved marble table at the head with nine preserved chairs, each with a single, golden Sphere glyph; the remains of what used to be a perfect certamen circle in the center; and the wooden remains of many chairs, now nothing but rotted sticks and boards. A single door and the chamber beyond still stands to the left, glowing a soft gold.         The great marble table has been split along a radius directly to the center, which has been hollowed out. A new wooden chair sits quietly in the middle of the damage, another golden glyph shining quietly on its back.                                  >                                  Contents: Hana Aaron Alexandre Abel Tal Rhiamon James Alyx Siomen Kasui Jonah Obvious exits: Left Door    Out      Abel listens to Aaron then turns to respond to him.

"It is good to see you again, Kawakami-san. It has been quite a while."  Hana bows casually, but in the innately formal manner of the Japanese. About 45 degrees, and then she goes back to peeling her orange, and glancing around. She's never seen so many people around here, it bears examination.  Siomen stands and makes his way over to the chair or matter, he sits down and starts to open his backpack.  Alexandre shifts where he stands next to Rhiamon. Then, he sits down on the ground next to her, crossing his legs. Might be a while.  Tal pulls a large manilla envelope out of his duster and sets it on his lap.  Aaron smirks and nods to Abel, continuing to speak in soft tones as to not disturb the meeting  Rhiamon nods to Alexandre. "Jane's not going to make it, but I bear her sigil.."  Aaron whispers to Abel.  Jet enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jet has arrived. Jet shuffles in  Hana finds a fragmnet of wall to lean against. Since she has yet to be asked to leave, she decides to stay.  Rhiamon smiles from her rubble-seat by the Forces chair. "Jet!"  Abel listens to Aaron and laughs just a little... softly.  Aaron's gaze turns as he hears Jat's name called and he raises his hand to wave to her from his seat by Abel  Alexandre sits by Rhiamon, crosslegged on the ground. He looks up at the entrance as Rhiamon calls out. He smiles as well and waves her over.  Jet looks around at Rhiamon's voice and smiles brilliantly! "Rhia, dahling, so good to see you." She heads over toward the Seat of Forces, with a cheery wave for Aaron along the way.  This room has been partially restored. Piles of carved stone can be seen beyond the walls, which seem to be rebuilding themselves gradually and slowly, as everyone speaks. Rubble has been cleared, debris swept away, new chairs brought in. The room is slowly, slowly coming together again, as if defiant of the ages and determined to be as it once was. (LOOK here - if you have at least Spirit 1, page Mercutio)  You paged Mercutio with 'Spirit 2.'.  Alyx glances to her side, at Tal, offering the choirester a slight smile before lifting a hand as if to beckon him closer, for quiet talking.  There are no Umbral Aspects here.                 Tal grabs the manilla envelope out of his lap and heads over to Alyx with a curious smile on his face. He leans on the arm of Entropy, "Sup?"  Alyx leans up with a smile on her lips, murmuring to the Choirester.  //.etro: Compton rolls "perception+Awareness" privately to Mercutio at diff 7.          For a total of 1 success(es).  Chase enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Chase has arrived.  Alyx whispers to Tal.  James would be sitting crosslegged on the floor as well, but still filing away at the stone he has.  Tal nods to Alyx and replies in low tones.  Tal whispers to Alyx.  Abel is sitting in the Gallery, watching the ruins rebuild themselves curiously. Aaron sits next to him.  Alyx nods towards Tal, sitting back a little after murmuring a reply.  Walking into the frey, Chase stalks. He already looks pissed and the shit hasn't even begun to fly. Sneakers walk him towards the seat of Correspondence. Harsh looks for Aaron, bloodshot eyes lock on him in passing. Though his gaze fades into a solid sneer in general as he takes his seat. The chewing gum bubble he *pops* lets those that know him, know it the real Chase and not some robot.  Alyx whispers to Tal.  Aaron meets Chase's gaze and smiles, speaking again softly to Abel  Aaron whispers to Abel. Tal reaches up and squeezes Alyx' hand with a smile before walking across the table again passing from Entropy to Prime once more. He sits at his appointed seat and folds his hands in his lap over the manilla folder.  Siomen just sits quietly, playing with Geero on his lap, geero still tucked away in the backpack. Seat of Matter never contested.  Abel frowns a little and shakes his head as Aaron speaks. Then he whispers back.  Jonah gradually makes his way into the Council Chambers. A soft click of his wooden cane preceeds each step, and a briefcase is held in his other hand. He takes his time walking through toward the Seat of Forces, quietly, saying nothing to anyone as he drifts through the room.  Abel whispers to Aaron.  Aaron shakes his head to Abel and replies to the man's soft words  Aaron whispers to Abel, "... tried... a..."  Abel nods and speaks softly back.  Jet murmurs to Rhiamon and Alexandre  Abel whispers to Aaron.  Mercutio pages: You see small spirits drifting back and forth through the ruins, carrying stone and mortar. There are a dozen of them, all working toward restoration of the room.  Prepared for unpleasantries, Chase leans back in the chair of Correspondence and kicks his sneakers onto the table one over the other. *Pop* Cynical.  Mercutio has arrived.  Tal is looking around in amused amazement and chuckling softly.  Alyx likewise sits back, though without putting her feet up, hands clasped on the tabletop, leather gloves squeaking a little.  Hana still leans against a wall in the back, eating her orange.  Compton watches the debris clean itself it. Brow krinkled in cofusion or wonder as he gazes out in to the mid point in the room. His head panning and his eyes darting, following somthing elusive.  Siomen just sits quietly and looks up as jonah enters, he nods as he casually tickles geero's stomach Aaron whispers to Abel, "... keep... doesn't..."  Kasui suddenly blinks, tilting her head to one side as she murmurs quietly, "Oro?" Her amber gaze seems to ollow somehting... just beyond view, like she is watching an invisibel parade.  Aaron whispers to Abel.  Abel listens to Aaron and nods, frowning a little, then turns to whisper to him again.  Jonah reaches the Seat of Forces, pulling it out from the table slightly. He sets his briefcase down on the tabletop. "Good morning, everyone," he says, his voice full and loud enough for all to hear. "If you would, please take a seat and pull it near to the table.  Abel whispers to Aaron, "... spearheading..." Alexandre stops whispering as he looks to Jonah, ready to listen.  Abel stands and grabs a chair, starting to head closer to the table with it.  Rhiamon stands, and fetches a chair for herself and Jet, placing them to one side of Jonah. Hana remains stationary.  Compton shuffles forward in his soggy footwear and sits down in one of the seats. Then doing the chair scooch along the rock floor. The heavy chair making a loud squeak with each inch it budges.   >  Alyx looks up and over to Jonah, fingers lifting to remove her reading glasses so she can focus on him properly.  James puts his stone, and file away, remaining where he is already seated.  Alexandre sits up, grabs a chair, sits to the same side of Jonah as Rhiamon and Jet. Without the speaking.  Siomen winces at all the noise, he sighs and remains where he is, close enough for his purposes, Geero beeping a couple times before shushed by its maker.  Chase doesn't shift from his chair, save the absent flexing of his square jaw on some gum.  Jet sits next to Rhiamon and Alexandre.  Rhiamon sneaks a small finger wave to Geero.  Geero hops up and manages to escape Siomen's grasp, he toddles over to Rhiamon. Kasui remins, of course, upon the Seat of Mind, her momentary distraction fading as she focuses her full attention upon Jonah.  Jonah casts a quiet, dicerning glance amongst everyone collected. "I fail to believe that this is everyone, but very well." He opens his briefcase and begins to remove some papers, placing them on the table adjacent the case. "If I have everyone's attention," with that, he spares a glance to everyone again, "I would like to call this meeting to order."  Abel sits back down and pulls his sun symbol on it's chain out from under his shirt, then lets is hang again. Siomen pulls out Cally's recording device and turns it on with a smile. he keeps an eye on Geero.  Abel's turns to see of Aaron haas followed him over then turns his attention to Jonah.  Rhiamon reaches down, and scoops Geero up, cradling him on her lap, so he can see.  Tal stops glancing about at the open air and turns his attention to Jonah.  Jet smiles at Geero, then looks up and winks at Siomen.  Siomen smiles back to jet and dips his head.  Alyx simply continues to watch Jonah, attention unwavering.  "My first order of business today was actually not on my agenda." Jonah retrieves a typed letter from the top of his neatly stacked papers. He places a pair of reading glasses over his nose. "It seems that Mr. Alex Hess has caused quite a stir with the Mr. Michaels situation." A brief glance is given to Aaron, followed by Chase and then Abel. "I do not validate this change in agreement off-hand. I suggest that you, Mr. Kettle, speak with Mr. Hess and determine an appropriate means to recover this situation. I will speak with Mr. Michaels myself at a later time. This matter /will/ be settled, however there are other agendas which currently take priority."  Compton does so, likewise. Being old enough to actually pay attention for extended periods.  Chase nods fervently. "I intend to." And that's he'll say at the moment. *Pop*  Siomen listens and frowns, wondering about the problem.  Tal tucks that bit away for later reference, doesn't concern him in particular.  Jet listens with apparent attention.  Abel nods to Jonah. "Of course, MAgister."  Attention wavering briefly, Alyx plucks a quarter-sized coin from the cuff of one of her sleeves, beginning to absently roll it along her knuckles.  Rhiamon looks curiously at Aaron, and tilts her head.  Jonah places the letter back in his briefcase, which is gently pushed to the side. "Right. Our next order of business is the development of the Earthside Chantryhouse. I have located several appropriate locations on the north side of town. So far, the most promising of the two is near an old, abandoned manorhouse called Lebrentis Manor. It is a slight distance out of town, though I feel that is a better decision than keeping it in town." He looks up from his papers, "Thoughts, comments, objections?"  Siomen tilts his head "Will this be a place to bring new members for introduction before introducing them to the realm? i still have a member wandering out there who hasn't been introduced to the rest of you, because i don't know who to bring him to without having him yelled at or worse attacked if i bring him here.  Not a word from the chair of Correspondence. Chase scratches under his chin lazily. Seems he's no particular thoughts pertinent to the location of the earth side Chantry.  Alyx lifts her chin slightly, lifting a gloved hand to indicate that she has a question, though not interrupting Siomen's question.  Kasui speaks up in a resonant, respectful, contralto as se finishes inking a series of Kanji and Kana to take note for her Sempai. "Sir, I am here representing the head of Dharma's Tear and the Seat of Mind in his absence due to pressing business. I do not know Kaze-sempai's thoughts on this subject, but my own is that there should be some means of hidden transit to the site. A park area liek this present entrance is public enough not to attract scrutiny if large numbers of people pass inexplicably through. However, a manor, or private residence, will attract attention due to too much traffic even if it is logically more secure a locale."  The Invisible College's lone representitive, Compton, maintains his silence.  Jet says, "I'm willing to volunteer my house, but I suspect the Union is aware of it, so I'm not sure it's a good choice. I have no real evidence that they are watching it, but it's not impossible. And I agree with the Chair of Mind that a place without regular mundane traffic can be found by traffic analysis if precautions are not taken."  Hana continues to simply listen and watch, in somewhat bemused silence.  James listens quietly.  Tal hmms quietly, "What about Casa Loma? Is it possible to move the gate somewhere inside it? It should not be impossible to bypass the security on such a large structure. There is quite a bit of tourist traffic in and out of it and its in downtown. We may not be able to have total control over the building, but if we are going to gain resources from New England, it shouldn't be too difficult to gain rooms as a 'historical society' or the like."  Abel looks to Tal at the seat of Prime to see what his ractions are.  Tal adds, "It also has the benefit of being a place considered to be odd by Sleepers, which is a mark in its favor."  Rhiamon listens, stroking Geero's head absently.  Jet says, "Do we have a group who can move the gate, in fact?"  Jonah looks over to Hana momentarily, his head cocking to one side. Studying her, he offers a smile. "Yes, yes you did. You are Kawakami Hanami, am I correct?"  Hana offers a compulsive bow, a shallow one but one perhaps in assent.  Siomen sighs as his question goes unanswered for yet another little while, he sits back and stays quiet.  Abel looks over at Hana then turns to Jet. "If the gate needs to be moved, I believe my Mentor and brother, Father Dismas, can help.  Chase says, "I can assist as well."  Jonah looks away from her. "I believe Casa Loma is too public. I liken it to Allan Gardens, personally, in its accesibility." He looks to Jet, "As for your house, Miss Levantine, I would prefer to find someplace more neutral than the existing house of a Hermetic. This Chantryhouse is for all, not just for us." He shuffles through some papers again, "As for Mr. Rutherford's question - yes, this place will both house the new Gateway and serve as an earthly location where new arrivals may be introduced and interviewed before allowed access to the Realm."  Jet says, "Public has certain advantages... in terms of hiding among normal traffic."  Siomen nods and smiles "Expect Jack 'lucky' London to visit soon then" James raises his hand.  Alyx's hand remains raised, green eyes fixed upon the magister that leads the council.  Hana seems more bemused by the fact that yet another stranger knows who she is, but lets the conversation move on past her, listening once more.  Abel turns to the unmoved Aaron and raises an eyebrow to him, inquizzitively, then turns back to the proceedings at hand.  Jonah guestures across the table to Alyx. "Yes, Miss Davian?"  Aaron keeps his seat in the Gallery and just watches the proceedings from whee he is. For those that know him, his silence and decorum might seem unsettling.  "What are the merits of this suburban house, Guru? I am still unfamiliar with much of Toronto; what kind of area is it in, and of the house itself, what of it's size and accessability?" Alyx inquires softly. "Also, what will be kept there, other than new recruits and the gateway?"  Jonah responds, "The merits of a suburban house are manyfold. It is in a private location, north of the city a few miles. The manorhouses there are large estates and very well separated. Privacy being the key, this location will serve well. The House is fairly large, and will be accessible to any who belong to the Chantry at any time they wish to be present. I am working on a security system which will likely consist of watchers at the gates who will likely control the 'automatic' gates." Thinking for another moment, he continues, "We will have the gateway at this location, as well as a centralized database with which we may better communicate. Also, the Chantry's new Library will partially exist in the Earthside structure."  Abel raises a hand to speak.  Jonah says, "Yes, Mr. Elison?"  James lowers his hand.  "Oh, one moment, Mr. Elison," Jonah says, "I apologize. You may speak, Mr...?"  Abel nods and waits. "Of Course."  James says, "Anderson. What would the merits of say a building on Campus, or an anex of the public library be?"  James says, "Since people suggested a semi public localle"  Jonah furrows his brow. "Well, they would be easily accessible, and I agree that public locales would be less obvious. However, a public locale is much more difficult to defend, and the ease of accessibility makes it possible for accidental entrance to the Realm through it's Shallowing. I am surprised that such a thing has never occured here."  Alyx lifts her hand once more. Jonah nods to Alyx, then looks to Abel. "Mr. Elison, then Miss Davian."  Abel stands. "Thank you Magister." He looks around the room. "I think we need to keep in mind that the Mirrorshades don't only know where the gateway is currently, but that they know -Us-. I know they know me. Neither Ms. Cixi nor Mr. Palmerton are happy with my petition and have told me so. They will find the Chantry. Is it possible to have doorways from multiple locations? All opening to the realm and from there to the chantry house? I don't want to have Hyperion's eyes follow me then bring them here by mistake."  Kasui 's hand stills in note taking for a moment as she raises it to next gain the attention of Jonah for th epurpose of speaking. Her amber eyes focus upon Abel as she listens otherwise quietly.  Kasui 's hand stills in note taking for a moment as she raises it to next gain the attention of Jonah for th epurpose of speaking. Her amber eyes focus upon Abel as she listens otherwise quietly. (re) Aaron smirks to himself and crosses his arms over his chest, leaning back in his seat in the Gallerly and putting his feet up on the chair in front of him as he continues to watch in that odd silent way of his "I don not fear the Mirrorshades, Mr. Elison," Jonah replies, confident. "This is a war. Each side possesses information about the other. That is not only acceptable, but it is to be expected. The purpose of moving the gateway is to better protect it - as it stands, it has little to no protection whatsoever. I am not afraid of being known insomuch as I am afraid of the Realm being taken."  Chase nods at Jonah's words. Slightly shifting in his chair, he chimes in support. "Here here."  Abel nods once to Jonah, then sits.  Jonah says, "Miss Davian?"  Tal nods in agreement with Jonah and shrugs in Abel's direction.  Abel shrugs back to Tal.  Alyx dosen't stand, though does lower her hand once addressed. "How /do/ you intend to protect the realm gateway, Guru? All the locks in the world are unlikely to stop the enemy if they decide they will intrude." Jonah suddenly blinks. "Oh. I apologize. One moment, Miss Davian." He looks back to Abel. "Multiple doorways are not out of the question. However, we will have one, to begin, and we can build others as we see fit, as long as they are properly secured." Then, without a pause, he turns to Alyx, "The gateway will be protected in many steps. Mundane guards, mundane security systems, magickal wards, and spirit guardians. The realm itself is already protected by five Guardians and their twenty lesser guardians."  Abel nods to Jonah.  Alyx inclines her head slightly to the magister's answer and returns to idly flipping her coin, never pausing to check which way it lands.  Jonah passes his gaze to Kasui, guesturing. "Miss Suzuno?"  Kasui nods once, tapping her papers agaisnt the table to straighten them as she stands smoothly to speak. "Firstly, I concurr that security is neve full proof or unbreakable. I have personal experience in that matter. That does not mea, however, it should nto be used for the purpose it is intended." Apparentlys omeone ha been sudying their english pretty hard. "Thatbeing, to slow an enemy down long enough to face the incursion or escape it. Secondly, I simply wanted to add to the list of possible measures, that we have multiple entrances to any gateway. Two or more. It will take more security to defend, but, simply, it will serve to spread our own entrants accross a broader range and timeframe while simultaneously allowing us more than one means of escape from our own den."  Jonah just nods, "As I said, other entrances are acceptable, but in due time. I am more concerned with moving the existing entrance before we work to create more." Kaze appears standing silently behind the Seat of Mind, one moment nothing and the next there he quietly stands like a Shadow behind where Kasui is seated. Having come late his entrance is soundless and indeed might go unnoticed unless you were looking in Kasui's direction at the time. Kasui ndos once, "I wish, then, to offer my services in construction of any material entrances, tunnels, or the like if needed. My skills with External Alchemy are my mystical Forte', even if I am only a disciple. Thank you, Magister." Catchng Kaze's presence out of the corner of he reye, she blinsk once and then bows to ehr Sempai before handing him her stack of calligraphied notes and stepping aside for him to occupy the seat.  Jet says, "Oh how interesting... perhaps you could give a seminar"  ********************************************************************** Penny skinrides Compton at this point. Sad thing is she gets more XP for Comp in one scene than I have. Bitch.  **********************************************************************  James listens quietly, a thoughtful expression on his face.  Jonah looks about for a moment, offering a bow to Kaze when he appears. Again, he passes a gaze to everyone, then finally he speaks. "We still have the matter of location. Personally, I prefer a non-public locale, such as the Manor. It is accessible to us without being accessible by others, it is more easily defended. However, it may not be accessible to all on an equal basis, and it may be more obvious. A public locale is easily accessible to everyone and is less obvious, though that ease of accessibility is also a downfall, as is the lack of effective security."  Alex enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Alex has arrived. Abel gets a blank look on his face at the mention of external alchemy, then seems to understand and settles back into his place. Alex steps into the council chambers, pausing just inside the door, to take a moment to look around....  Hana leans against bthe wall next to the doorway, apart from the group gathered around the table.  At Alex's arrival, Chase turns his head to stare at the man. *Pop* There's no greeting in his bloodshot eyes.  Jesyca enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jesyca has arrived. Jesyca tries to quietly walk into the meeting, looking rather sheepish at arriving so late.  Hana offers a quiet greeting, though. "Hi Alex.."  Kaze returns Jonah's bow before moving gracefully to take over the Seat of Mind vacated by Kasui, taking her notes in hand and looking them over as he sits there listening for the moment.  Abel seems to have pulled a chair from the gallery closer to the table. Occasionally he looks back to the gallery to where Aaron is sitting. Around the room, the chantry seems to be slowly rebuilding itself.  Alex moves to take a seat in the gallery. A small nod is given to Hana in response to her greeting.  Jonah glances to Alex as he enters, then looks over to Chase. "Mr. Kettle, unless you have an immediate opinion on the current matter, I will excuse you so that you may speak with Mr. Hess."  Jet smiles at Aaron.  Chase stands at Jonah's words, nodding. Knuckles flex and his sneakers start him towards Mr. Hess with bad intention. A snap of his callused fingers, he point at Alex and gestures for him to follow the punk into the chamber beyond.  Jesyca walks over towards Abel, green eyes drifting over towards Aaron a moment and then back towards Abel.  Kaze's gaze wanders meaningfully towards Chase, Alex, and the Magister for a moment but returns to the notes not long after breezing through the calligraphy like it was english.  Abel smiles up at Jes warmly, offering her a hand, then leans in to whiper to her. Abel whispers to Jesyca.  Alex stops just before he sits, his head turning slightly in Chase's direction at the snap of his fingers. A frown creases his brow and he pauses, definantly it would seem, before following Chase, casually, into the other chamber.  Chase steps back out to the main hall. Chase has left.  Tal steps back out to the main hall. Tal has left.  Jesyca steps back out to the main hall. Jesyca has left. Jesyca enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jesyca has arrived.  Kasui stands, now, completely silent at KAze's side. She seems, almost, to simply be an ornament with as still as she stands, her hands olded beneath the billowy sleeves of her kimono.  Tal enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Tal has arrived.  Alex steps back out to the main hall. Alex has left.  Abel turns to Jonah. "I see no problem with a private Chantry at the Location you suggest Magister. I think a private entrance is best."  Jesyca quietly kneels down onto her knees by Abel, letting the dark material of her cloak spill out on the ground around her.  Jonah says, "All in favor of a private Chantryhouse?"  Rhiamon holds up her hand, "Mercuria and I would also prefer a private entrance." The hand she raises holds a ring.  Cassius nods, "I am, Magister."  Hana's growing bored with things, and tired as well. Tilting her head back she rubs her neck and looks up at the ceiling, if there is one.  Tal nods, "I am, Magister."  Kaze raises one hand slightly, "Hai." he says loud enough to be heard actually looking up from the notes now to answer.  Alyx does not raise her hand, though she dosen't seem particularly opposed to the decision. kset Are we for ro against it?   Jesyca nods her head agreeing with Abel and Tal.  James raises his hand and waits to be counted before lowering it again.  Jonah counts all the affirmative votes, then says, "All opposed? Speak now or forever hold your peace."  Rhiamon lowers her hand.  Compton reaches inside the pocket on his loud shirt and pulls out what looks like a postit note. Opening it he pauses and says in his gravelly voice he states with some authority, "The Invisible College does not support this action."  Geero beeps softly and reaches a hand to the ring in Rhia's hand. She smiles at him, but puts it safely out of his way.  Alyx lifts her hand slowly, though remains silent on the matter.  Jonah looks over to Compton, curiously, while still watching and counting. "Do you mind if I ask why the Invisible College does not support this?"  Tal sighs gently and shakes his head with a smirk.  Abel looks over at Tal, sighing a bit.  Compton visibly pinks around the ears at this question. Obviously he wasn't expecting to actually have to talk about anything, "I, well, um..." he gets going witha rough start, "I, I mean we think we should stay inside the city... Around the masses. A subtle urban locale allows us to hide in plain sight."  Tal asks gently, "Um, you guys wouldn't be disagreeing out of habit, would you?" He smiles at Compton, slightly amused.  Abel turns to Compton as well. "Do you guys have a better suggestion?"  Jonah nods, slowly, while still watching Compton. "Yes, I do understand that." He waves a respectfully dismissive hand at Tal, "No, he presents a valid point. It would be less obvious if we were in the city. I will note the objections of the Invisible College as valid and consider them in my final determination. However, as it currently stands, the ayes have it."  Rhiamon reaches into her bag, holding Geero steady with one hand as she listens, and fishes out a small gilt chain which she drapes carefuly round his neck, careful that it dosen't get caught in any of his gears, then goes back to gently scratching his stomach area.  Tal looks as if he suspects otherwise, "True, Magister. He does raise a good point." He inclines his head respectfully to Compton.  Jonah reaches down and retrieves a pen, actually writing something down on a fresh sheet of paper. A moment, and he guestures to Alyx, "Miss Davian, your objection, for the record?"  Compton crumples his little postit, and sits back again visibly relaxing. Quietly he slips a tiny paper bag warpped bottle from his pants and takes a sip. Those close enough might get a wiff of diesel fuel for some odd reason.  Hana tilts her chin down again, looking for a long moment at Jonah, then at Compton, and finally back again. "Doesn't it all depend on who you're hiding from?" she says, her English perfect, but accented. "I mean, that is what matters, when choosing an advantageous location from which to fight...or to hide. The capabilities of the enemy always...come under consideration.  Allowing her hand to drop, once she's been noticed, Alyx murmurs, "I simply dislike all the cloak and dagger, Guru." Perhaps amusing, given her current garb. "While I am painfully aware of the need for secracy, this sounds far more like the 'secret house' of a 'secret club' who have 'secret meetings' and passwords and all the rest that goes with such childish behaviours. Something like the current arrangement at the zoo, where the only 'secret' is location, I find far more to my taste. It is only a personal dislike, however, and I do not speak for my Tradition when I say it."  Abel turns to Tal, a questioning look on his face and mouths 'Zoo?'  Jesyca leans up a bit to speak to Abel. She whispers to Abel, "I..."   Tal shrugs to Abel, he looks at a loss himself.  James frowns thoughtfully  Abel blinks and turns down to Jes.  Aaron has, for his part, remained quiet and rather polite as he sits in the Gallery. ot once having offered an opinion or even a single word to the topics discussed.  Abel whispers to Jesyca.  Kaze finishes the entirety of the notes while still seemingly giving his meeting his full attention and arranges them neatly in front of him on the table looking from one speaker to another not yet choosing to say his own piece.  Jesyca speaks quietly back towards him, She whispers to Abel, "... things... tell.... target..."  kset Sure, so we can do 3 times as much nothing? :P  Abel hmms and nods to Jes, then leans down to her.  Abel whispers to Jesyca, "... mask you."  Jonah nods slowly, first to Hana and then to Alyx. "I understand your objections and will note them, Miss Davian." To which, he does just that. Silence passes the next few moments, interrupted only by the soft breeze and the eerie sound of the walls being rebuilt all around. Finally, "Miss Kawakimi, our enemy is that of the Technocratic Union. From what I understand, you know little of the threats which exist to us, though there are some who would be willing to teach you. Our enemy is powerful and organized."  Jesyca gives a quiet bow of her head towards Abel growing silent once more.  Aaron leans back softly and seems to close his eyes, settling into a comfortable position.  This statement has Hana's attention.  Abel seems to think of something then raises his hand, while looking down at Jes. birthday, here in a bit. Keene enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Keene has arrived.  Alexandre has connected.  Keene comes in, hopefully during a collective pause in the conversation, and moves over to stand or sit nearby Compton.  Jonah glances over to Abel, "Mr. Elison?"  Abel turns to look at Jonah. "Will this place you have in mind still be under the protection from The Storm the Spear of Longinus on top of the CN tower grants us?"  Jonah says, "The effects of the Spear do end at the edges of the city, however the storm does not seem to exist until a decent distance outside the city itself. This location is within the calm zone."  Compton nods over to Keene, getting his flask out for the umpteenth time. He says something to the man and nods at Jonah at the same time.  Abel nods.  Compton mutters to Keene, "... don't think he... what..." You whisper "Slow going, don't think he gives a rat's ass what we do." to Keene.  Somehow, Keene knew he would come in just as talk of the Spear of Destiny began. This is why his Valium-blood level is at a nice, optimal level. He moves, sits down next to Compton, and leans in a bit once he starts talking to him. He gives no audible reply; instead, he inclines his head once, pats Compton on the shoulder, and offers him a cigarette from his breast pocket. Meanwhile, with his other hand, he takes out a legal pad and pen from inside of his coat.  Jonah looks over to Compton and Keene for a moment. He offers a nod of greeting to Keene, then looks back to his notes. "Very well. On the motion to determine the location of the new Earthside Chantryhouse, we have voted that it shall be a private location, outside of the city. I will review this decision and notes taken regarding it and announce a resolution within the next few days." He scribbles something onto this piece of paper, then turns it over and places it in his briefcase. A new sheet withdrawn, he looks to everyone. "Now, we will begin collecting a list of those interested in being part of this Chantry. I will begin by recording the names of the existing Cabals and their members, and then I shall go to those who are not currently part of a cabal and record their names."  Compton slips two fingers into his left-breast pocket, trading cigarettes with him offering a light on the heels of the gesture. Choking a little on his first drag, Compton hacks and snorts his way through Johah's summary.  Abel turns to Tal.  Keene takes Compton's offered cigarette in a smooth movement, putting it between his lips as he catches   Jonah's nod. He returns the gesture politely, then lights up the cigarette with his usual black Zippo. Meanwhile, with his other hand, he starts writing on his legal pad.  Tal nods to Abel then turns his attention to Jonah, waiting for him.  Chase enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Chase has arrived.  Alex enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Alex has arrived. Alex follows Chase into the council chambers and heads back over to the chair he was about to sit in before he was called out to the other chamber to speak with Chase.  Jonah guestures to Tal, who currently occupies the Seat of Prime. "Starting with the Seat of Prime, we shall go 'round the table, collecting the names of Cabals and their members. If you are not a part of a cabal, please pass until we return to you." He looks to Tal, expectantly.  Tal begins, "I, Taliesin Emrys, am a member of the Beacon in the Dark. Abel Elison is also a member as are my two apprentices, Millia McMillan and Jesyca Petrovich."  Jonah writes this information down as it is given to him. Moments pass, then he looks to Kaze, in the Seat of Mind. "Seat of Mind is next."  Kaze waits until Tal has finished and then speaks himself, "I, Shinketsu Kaze, lead the Cabal Dharma's Tear. Both of my Kohai, Mizuno Kasui and Tian Shi Chou are also members."  Jonah again scribbles this down, moving on. "The Seat of Spirit is Vacant, we move on to the Seat of Matter." (is Siomen in it, but idle?)  Chase now reoccupies the seat of Correspondence in relative silence. Though his tech vest makes some noises one would associate with teflon armor as he resettles. *Pop*  Jonah notes down the members of Team Ether, then moves to the next seat. "Next is this Seat, the Seat of Forces. As I am only a temporary representative, I shall turn to Miss Jones for input."  Jonah notes down the members of Team Ether, then moves to the next seat. "Next is this Seat, the Seat of Forces. As I am only a temporary representative, I shall turn to Miss Jones for input." (repose)  Keene sits quietly, taking notes as Jonah speaks.  Abel remains quiet as the cabals are announced, offering his hand for Jes to hold, smiling down at her.  Rhiamon clears her throat, and looks to the other two by her, "The Turris Scientiae cabal is formed of myself, Holly Levantine, Alexandre Taylor and Jane Smith. Viktor might also be joining us."  Jet murmurs to Alexandre and Rhiamon  Jonah nods, passing on as he continues to write. "The Seat of Life is currently unrepresented, as is the Seat of Time. I know who represents both and have received word from both, however, and thus will take note of such later. Now, we move on to the Seat of Correspondence." His glance goes to Chase.  "After-Math consists of myself, Alex Hess, Maisri MacKenzie, and will be receiving a new field operator and acolyte from a different chapter in the coming weeks. Also, we''l receive a new member pending on a discussion which will take place after this meeting." Chase says with a slight smirk, punctuating his statement with a small flinch under his left eye. After he states his piece, he leans back in chair and kicks his feet up again.  Rhiamon murmurs quietly to her cabal-mates.  Abel quirks an eyebrow.  Aaron finally speaks from the Gallery, "Don't count on it, Kettle.."  Jonah just ignores this, noting down what he must, then moving on. "Last at the table is the Seat of Entropy." He looks up to Miss Davian." -"  Alyx smiles pleasently towards Jonah. "I, Alyx Davian, am of no Cabal," she murmurs. "Nor, to my knowledge, is Mr Tullern, who formally occupies this seat, though that is something I would advise you check with him, once he returns."  Aaron, for those recently arriving, is lounging in the Gallery with his head back and his eyes closed. He did not look up when Chase spoke, but simply spoke his mind and remained in place  Jonah nods. "Very well." He glances about to the rest of the people. "Are there any other Cabals not represented by a Seat at present?" The glance falls on Keene and Compton, "The Invisible College?"  Jet says, "Trinity is non-geographical, I'm in that also."  Alex's head turns in Keene and Compton's direction, for a brief moment, before glancing over to the Seat of Spirit.  Tal clears his throat softly, "The Invisible College is represented by Ms. Inscrutable in the Seat of Spirit, Magister."  Abel looks over to the Invisible College members from his seat.  Bloodshot eyes drift towards Jet in an 'aroo?' fashion. Chase shifts, taking his feet off the table. "Say that again?" He prompts the girl.  Jonah looks over at Tal, from him to the Seat of Spirit, and then back to Tal. "Funny, Mr. Emrys, but I see no one currently seated in the Seat of Spirit, thus no one is representing it, and the Invisible College is not, at this time, represented by a seat."  Tal seems about to reply but just shrugs. Apparently Daze never replied.  Compton keeps his mouth shut, defering to Keene taking another drag on his cigarette.  Keene, with a sense of lingering dread, pauses in his writing. He puts down his notepad and gets up, smoothing his tie, then speaking. "The Invisible College itself does not lay claim to a seat at this time. However, I believe that Daisy Inscrutable earlier claimed interest in holding the seat of Spirit. It would be in her hands to affirm or deny that claim now, but she is not present." He smiles thinly. Passing the buck is how Keene gets his cardiovascular exercise.  James looks at Keene and frowns.  Jonah watches Keene, as if that were not the exact answer he was looking for. He speaks, to clarify, "Who is the leader of the Invisible College?"  "I am," says Keene.  Jonah nods, "And as the leader of the Invisible College, do you wish for your Cabal to be a part of this Chantry?"  James looks at Keene and frowns.  Jonah watches Keene, as if that were not the exact answer he was looking for. He speaks, to clarify, "Who is the leader of the Invisible College?"  "I am," says Keene.  Jonah nods, "And as the leader of the Invisible College, do you wish for your Cabal to be a part of this Chantry?"  Keene pauses for a moment, looking over at Compton. Then he returns his attention to Jonah. "Yes, we would like to be part of this Chantry." A simple, unambiguous answer. My God, the world will end.  Jonah blinks, looking up from his paper, where his pen still hovers, waiting. "Very well. And the members of your Chantry, please?"  Abel seems a bit surprised at Keene's response.  Rhiamon has partially disconnected.  Jet says, "Welcome aboard."  "The members of the Invisible College," says Keene, "are Jesse Truant, Penny Ante, Hiro Stace, Daisy Inscrutable, Eric Compton and myself, Steve Keene."  Jet says, "Are those all pseudonyms?"  Alyx resumes absently rolling her silver coin over her knuckles, barely watching it. Abel stretches in his seat a bit, squeezing Jes's hand.  Aaron remains in place in the Gallery, still looking much like he's sleeping  "Stice," Compton corrects, ashes on the floor between his feet.  Jonah looks satisfied, now that the names come out. He notes them down on paper, briefly, and looks up once more. "Any other Cabals not mentioned? If not, we shall begin taking the names of those interested in being part of this Chantry who are not part of a Cabal."  Jesyca smiles up to Abel having been quiet for awhile, that or she may have done like she did the last time she was in one of these meetings. She casts a quick look towards Tal just to make sure.  Keene nods to Compton. "I always mess up his name," he mutters, then sits down once his turn has seemingly passed. He either didn't hear or isn't going to answer Jet's question.  Compton whispers to Keene, "How... charade?"  You whisper "How long do we have to keep up this charade?" to Keene.  Jonah glances up, to Compton. "Charade, Mr. Compton?"  Abel looks over at Compton as well.  Compton says overly loud "Yeah, CHARADES. We have a game scheduled with the local pre-school. We volunteer."  Rhiamon toys absently with Geero's new chain as she listens.  James waits quietly for things to move on.  Jonah frowns sharply, guesturing to Keene, "You asked Mr. Keene how long you had to keep up this charade."  Jonah asks, "What charade?"  Siomen smiles faintly and looks over, he wants to hear this"  This even gets aaron to sit up and take notice, "And they're all after me.....figures.."  Alex chuckles softly at Jonah's questioning of Compton, turning his head slightly in Compton's direction.  Kaze's gaze travels from the Magister to Compton and Keene now, as calm and unphaseable as ever, though he seems interested enough in the question.  Rhiamon holds up a hand, though listening..  Jesyca's green eyes drift up towards Abel and then towards the ground a moment fidgeting with her cloak quietly.  Compton shrugs it off "Look, I'm tired and I've got a cabal member slightly comatose back at our place. She needs me more than you so I've been feigning interest in being here for the sake of the group." He gets up from where he was sitting "May I be excused?"  Abel looks over at Compton's excuse to leave and quirks an eyebrow. Then turns to Tal.  Jonah watches Compton, unconvinced. In fact, he's not even moved since he caught the whispered conversation. "You will forgive me if I do not immediately believe you, Mr. Compton, however I will excuse you. I will speak with you at a later date concerning this issue."  Alex raises an eyebrow at Compton's explaination, doubt plain on his face.  Aaron watches this scene with some interest and arches a brow as Jonah excuses Compton, "Fuck me...", can barely be heard to pass his lips, followed by a soft laugh.  Keene sits back, a neutral expression on his face. He doesn't look over when Compton talks to him, nor does he show any particular response to Jonah's questioning. He puffs on his cigarette, adjusting his glasses. His gaze tracks from Jonah to Compton, where it sits for several seconds. He puffs on his cigarette, rolls his tongue inside of his mouth, and puffs a smoke ring over Compton's head. Then, after a languid moment, he moves his attention back to Jonah. He gets back up.  "Several members of my organization," he says, "dislike that I have chosen to align ourselves with this Chantry. They feel the security in the Chantry is questionable at best," and he looks at Aaron for a long moment before looking back to Jonah, "and that this Realm should be allowed to be destroyed. Fundamentally, they feel several aspects of this Chantry and its operations raise red flags, and that we should consider moving our operations elsewhere to avoid the seemingly inevitable wrath of the Technocracy."  "I," says Keene, "do not feel that way. I feel that under your guidance, Magister, conditions will improve. This Chantry will become safer and better for all of us, and ultimately we will be able to make real progress in the Ascension War. But this has been a hard sell for me to my cabal."  He gestures with his cigarette. "I lead not so much because of the consent of the governed, but because I am simply one of the few people left in the cabal who has faith in the ability of the Order of Hermes to lead us all to a better day. They wish no part of this Chantry -- I, however, have insisted upon it. I trust in your leadership, Magister. Please forgive my colleague's rudeness."  At that, he inclines his head respectfully, then awaits whatever judgement Jonah may pass.   A soft clatter, as Alyx's silver coin is flipped down onto the tabletop, spinning on it's edge before coming to -*+alt on one side. She examines it's fall and nods, scooping the coin up and tucking it back into it's place under the cuff of her gloves, looking then over towards Jonah.  Abel turns and frowns a bit when he hears Aaron, then turns back to Keene.  Siomen sniff softly "Perhaps you should pass the issue to your cabal then.. that if they feel this place has questionable security, then why do they not offer suggestions on improving it?"  Compton walks out, asiding to Jonah "Whatever, man. You wanna drop by? We're at the Holiday fuckin'Inn. Room One Seven Four. Keene," looks over his shoulder "Bring home some tp and a sixer. I'm out."  Jonah listens to Keene's momentary monologue, listening and interested in what the man has to say. He nods. "I understand the concerns of those in your Cabal, Mr. Keene, and agree with those concerns one hundred percent. Hence, I was sent here to fix those exact problems. This is what we are currently attempting to do."  You step back out to the main hall.  ~Fin~

      **Penny and Compton do some more research in to happenings at Hyperion**  U of T - Courtyard(#532RJ)       The large circular driveway which circles the U of T courtyard appears as if it has been recently paved. In the daytime, close to a hundred student cars line the sides of the roadway, silent under the the slender trees. Students of every colour and ethnic background wander back and forth to their classes or sit, smoking, on the steps of the Sanford Fleming Building. Just to the north, a large circular expanse of grass turns the courtyard into a cul-de-sac. On the other side of the field the great dome of Convocation Hall dwarfs the surrounding brownstone buildings. Just to your left you see University College Residence, a large square featureless building. Utilitarian grey paint covers the outside of this institutional looking building, the only visible decorations being a number of posters and signs taped to the inside of their dorm windows. Facing this bland building, is one of the oldest buildings on the U of T Campus, the Sir Sanford Fleming building. The old brownstone building seems to have been recently renovated, and a bright blue sign on the small patch of grass in front of it confirms this fact. At night the campus is all but deserted, yet brightly illuminated with security lights. Haggard looking students wander the campus, looking as if they've just escaped the Siberian salt mines, some of them acknowledging the security guards who go about their rounds.  Contents: Dunce Campus Courtyard Bulliten Board  Penny picks up her cellular phone and begins to dial.  Dunce sits on the library stairs, reading.  Penny holds something small out in front of her. Looks like a phone. She stares at it, squints at it like it's supposed to be doing something. But clearly it isn't.  Compton from the other end of the line grumbles a vauge hello.  Penny stands neaby the bulletin boards, moves slowly to lean on one of it's posts and puts the phone to her ear again. She sticks her other hand in her pocket and juts that hip out from the wall; balance of a kind rocking heel-to-toe as she talks.  The room, despite basic descriptions is a bloody mess. 4 to 5 people have shared this space for a while now. There's a large hole burned in the carpet between the beds. Compton is sitting on the edge of the far bed talking on the phone, cradling his head in his hands, from the reciver can be heard Penny's shrill voice which seems to visibly hurt Compton, it says "Yeah so I think I've got something here. Need to you to look at it, maybe make some changes. You hear about that accident the other night?", to which Compton grumbles a dull, "Uh, no... big fucking city ya know?" in return.  Downtown - Spadina and Dundas W(#263RJ) Penny's voice on the phone is overly-loud. She volleys with "Would you FUCKING WAKE UP. Jesus. Fucking motor oil for brains. And get Keene. He should see, too. Look," she pauses, sounds like she's walking down a busy street. A jangle of noises; street vendors and hissing steam, busses and people. Must be Chinatown. "I'm coming back now, okay? Plastered the campus with flyers again - should be a better turn out than last week. Get dressed. And you better not be in my robe. That shit's new."  Downtown - Spadina and Queen W(#261RJ) Compton jerks the phone away from his stricken head, and listens to the rest of Penny's diatribe with the phone on his lap. He looks down and realizes that he is in fact not in Penny's robe, but in last nights clothes still. Next Compton peers at the detrius of the room around him, and eventually calls to the can, "Keene? You there?" to no reply. Raising the receiver cautiously to his head he says, "Keene's not here. I think."  She sneezes and curses and yells "Hey, I'm WALKIN'here!" away from the phone - it's muffled and covered in wind-noises. She must be pointing the phone at whoever just tried to run her over. Suddenly all background noise is cut off; like she stepped inside a vacuum. "Comp? You still there? I'm here. Open the door, forgot my key again."   Penny knocks on the door marked .  Compton hangs up the phone without another word. Gets up and crosses the room to the door, twists the knob and lets it swing oipen on his way tot he bathroom next to it. IN there the sound of a steady and heavy steam hitting the bowl resonanates for a couple of minutes. Finished witha lough moan/sigh of relife. You enter the apartment.  Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Escalus Compton Dave the Monkey % Activity in world legacy "So, whatchew got for me." come from the Bathroom which Compton occupies at the moment.   Escalus says "Guys, I have ten minutes until lunch."   Escalus says "I will be back, afterwards."  Penny looks down both ways before walking in the way people do when they know there's a boobytrap waiting to be sprung on them. Or not. She continues cautiously, still looking around the room. There's Keene's laptop. There's Jesse's sleepingbag. There's Pobble's box. "Where's that goddamn monkey? He *better* still be bound and gagged." Sneaks a look among Jesse's crates of lps. "In that closet," pokes through Hiro's amps "Locked in the box," insinuating she'll try to kill him again, Penny shuffles toward the second bed, shrugging out of her jacket.  "Comp?" knowing he's tuned her out for the better part of the rant "Daze said she's bringin'home dinner later. Come out, wanna show you."  OOC Compton says "No worries. Sorry for the wait." OOC Penny says "We can keep ourselves occupied - how long'll you be? - so we can tailor our rp,.." OOC Escalus says "I will be back 1 hour and ten minutes from now. But I am enjoying the scene."  The gutteral glug-glug of the toilet flushing heralds Comptons return to the other part of Thi Invisible College's palace. He's looking alright actually, everything considered seeing how he has most likel;y just come off a bender with various heavy metals. His fly still down though, so at least there's a sense of inoperability still around. "McRaunchy's again? Fuck, stuff gives me the shits." is his opening comment. Nice.  Stretched out on the bed, Penny's skin is still slick from the fog outside. She looks strange; pale slithery thing, hollow eyed and bone shallow. Sunk low, she unpockets her phone and tosses it to the floor. "My turn, right? Throw us a towel." Rolling that way, she pulls open the drawer and clips herself a tab. "Thought maybe I was seeing things, big crash outside the quay" tongues the square off her thumb "go into my pocket and look at that. Guy totally flipped out and ran some people over.."  And afterward, looking at the ceiling "Xyz, man." Compton glances at the ceiling with you, looking for the Zee'sis for a moment before clueing in and closing the barn door. Grabbing any old towel from the end of the other bed he drops it on you when he plunks down next to you on the bed. "Kay. Sounds pretty heavy."  "Was," affirming that "Looked over and They said it wasn't nothin' they could sense so I kinda kept on but y'know that feeling?" She wipes the towel over her head, face and neck "That one where you know something just isn't right.. had this intuition. So" she hitches back onto an elbow "took that picture. Lookit," nodding to the polaroid coming out of her jacket's inner-pocket.  Compton grins at the sight of the 'Polaroid' before even looking at the picture, "Picking up soem tricks of the old guy eh?" he asks in usual Canadian parlance. Then he looksd at the photo and sees...? It looks likee a regular old car accident. Busted up vehicle in a lightpole, inured people on the sidewalk, unconcious driver, blood everywhere. General mayhem.  She smiles some, going gently into her altered state "Shoulda SEEN this woman," exaggerating details in drawn-out words "Biiiig frilly dress comin'out of the Eaton Center. Totally into letting me borrow her stuff. Didn't have any'a your equipment, can't do that shit with the lights but maybe you can poke at it with your sticks, make it show us something."  "Somthing?" Compton asks skeptically, and scowells at the photo as if willing it to just give up to goods and save him the hassell. "Will take a while." he adds defending his technical skills with a expectation buffer. "What are we looking for?"  Her vaguest response yet, looking at the ceiling, the smoke detector. "Something in the air." Penny shifts herself a little and sneezes the other way. "'mind me to get a damn hat. Fucken weather." She grouses and grumbles, then settles back down. "We could sell'em," indicating the pile of polaroids "Or copies at least. Tabloids love this shit."  Compton continues to glare at the 4x4 picture as he gets up and moves over to the heap in the closet and begins to rummage, pulling out a duffle bag.  Escalus has connected. From the bag, Compton pulls his rusty-trusty Ether Goggles. Returning to Keene's desk he sits down and dons them, using the erstwhile leaders Notebook as a spot to work on. Penny loses all interest in keeping her eyes open, starts humming something to herself. Indistinct at first, the tune builds into something recognizable. Flight of the Bumble Bee. It goes on like this for ten minutes; every other stanza interrupted by a sneeze or a cough. Finally she gets up and blows her nose with the last tissue in the box. She notices. She's subtle.  "You need to cut that out."  "You don't have to do it now. Got something else in mind." Clearing her sinuses, Penny grabs a marker on the way into the bathroom. OOC Penny says "Hi :) Welcome back."  Compton props the goggles up on his forehead and scowels at Penny, fucking flake that she is. "What you on today woman?" he asks with mounting annoyance.  From the bathroom, Penny's disembodied voice echos "Wednesday."  Curt and to the point, that's all she says, all she needs to say. Some noises follow; clearing space, knocking empties into the garbage can, toothbrushes and hairbrushes and combs clicking with their plasticky static into the bathroom sink. "Eep'ose og. Oo igh'eed'en." Something impeding real annunciation. Marker in her mouth.  Compton pockets the Polaroid, and gets up witha grunt of effort from the all too small chair for his big ass and trundles off to the loo to see what Penny's up to this time. "Huh?" is his response to your ooglings. The googles still on his mellon regardless.  OOC Penny says "You with us Esc?" OOC> Escalus says "Indeed, yes." OOC> Penny says "Kay, this is where my speshul talents come in." OOC> Escalus is waiting with baited breath. OOC Compton waits with fish. OOC Penny says "PHENOMENON - When Compton comes into the bathroom, Penny is going to close the door behind him. She has markered up the doorframe with the vacant lot's address. This is the door's new 'target' - it opens into the lot instead of Room 174. ACTION - Penny is using the doorway focus for the Corr/Matter effect to take place. THEORY - This was one of the last trick Penny turned to graduate from Benny's tutelage - a doorway is just another frame - another window out into the world. Turning the knobs and hinges out of a door is easy - they tell the door where you want it to open - it's all in the wrist." OOC> Penny corrects: it opens into the lot's umbral representation. OOC> Escalus says "Oooh. You do realize, however, that you do not have the spirit necessary to handle material. Compton does, however. You can sense across the barrier with spirit 1, but not move across it." OOC> Penny says "Right. Which is why he's in here with me. Ethernaut." OOC> Compton bristles with helpfulness. OOC> Escalus says "Allright, with you working together, Penny, you can add 1 auto success to each roll that Compton makes. This will be a difficulty 6 arete roll. Would you like to spend quint or willpower, and will you make it an extended roll?" OOC> Penny says "Yes." OOC> Compton does too, to be helpful, and because he never rolls well. :P OOC> Escalus says "Penny, you are not actually rolling, so you cannot spend WP. Sorry." OOC> Penny says "Rats!" OOC> Escalus says "Okay, Compton, you have two auto successes. Roll vs. diff. 6." //.etro: Compton rolls "arete" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). OOC> Escalus says "You have two successes." OOC> Compton gets down to biz now. Sorry. OOC> Escalus says "You can draw, with that, some spirit stuff into this room." //.etro: Escalus rolls "6" at diff 8          For a botch! Compton lowers the goggles over his eyes as he realizes what Penny is up to by the glyphics she's scrawled around the door. Standing firmly in front of the prepared portal he opens the door and gazes beyond.  Flick of the wrist, Penny opens the door. Only it's no longer the sty of the Holiday Inn. Instead it's perennial twilight out there in the OtherSpace. "Okay, now don't go too far. There's something out there - looks like brick only not. Get it, bring it back."  OOC> Escalus says "Where did you get the idea that they woudl be bricks?" OOC> Penny says "Makin'it up." OOC> Escalus says "'Kay! :D" OOC> Penny :)  Penny is totally unconvincing - she doesn't sound like she knows what she's talking about but she's into it. She's enthusiastic. She's psyched it worked.  So what're we looking at - what do we see?  "Penny. Go in to the bag (the one he brought in with him, that everyone hadn't noticed until now), and pass me the gloves." Compton instructs quickly.  The brick sits quiescent in the umbra, since both of you can see it.  The gloves in question being an old pair of hockey gloves, that have several meters of sterio wire wrapped around the fingers and wrists, where they meet a couple of 9V batteries duct taped around the KOHO logos at the arm band.  Penny yanks them out of the sack, nose turned up "You gotta dead rat in there? Shit man, supposed to air this stuff out before you put it away. Here.." hands them over without another comment.  The block is still unmoving. Just spirit matter floating where you put it.  Compton reaches back, and picks at the seat of his pants, adjusting a wedgie apparently, before taking the gloves and putting the two of them on. The first one goes on easy, the second one not-so as he had to negotiate it with the other glove. The he steps forward and reaches in to Otherspace with both hands, as if plucking a loaf from the oven.  Compton reaches back, and picks at the seat of his pants, adjusting a wedgie apparently, before taking the gloves and putting the two of them on. The first one goes on easy, the second one not-so as he had to negotiate it with the other glove. The he steps forward and reaches in to Otherspace with both hands, as if plucking a loaf from the oven.  The spirit-stuff is soft and spongy to the touch, just as you expect it would be.  Penny waits there like a kid looking for cookies. "Hurry up with that. Don't want anything sneakin'.. " Penny on the lookout. She's watching everything. "Come on already."  Compton steps back now, in his gloved hands the etherical tofu cube.  Penny tilts her head, staring. She slams the door fast and starts scrubbing at the writing on the frame with a toothbrush. Toothpaste smell festers in the air; minty fresh.  Compton stands there, blast goggles still on and his industiral oven mits and says, "Um, where d'ya want it?" and turns to put 'it' down on the edge of the tub, to those not seeing in to the other realm, it just looks as if he'd doing some weird-ass mime routine.  You say, "What's it feel like?" She scrubs harder, moving the ink, destroying the link. "In there, in there. Put it there," looking over her shoulder at the tub. "Is it alive?"  Alive? That is an interesting question. As Penny destroys the link you can take the stuff and putt in where you want in your spirit world. It just moves there.  Compton says, "I dunno... what's alive feel like?" Compton asks, and knowing him it would prolly mean a strippers boob pressed up again his face, in fact except for the shape, that's kinda what if eeels like it dawn on him, "Like a square tit." is his final summarization of the experience."  The spirit stuff is rather pliable. Kinda like a thick play-doh.  Penny grabs a washcloth and wipes down the doorway til it's back to white. She looks down at her own and fingers the edge of her shirt "That's what came out of that Thing, made the screaming. It's not a *boob*, you boob. I.." squinting at it, or the space where it is, "..wonder. You remember that time we were in Jesse's place and he was talkin'some garbage about things taking their own form?"  Compton says, "I know it's not a boob, I said it felt like one."  Compton pulls off the gloves and pushes the goggles back up on to his forhead, looking back at Penny, "Um, huh?" is his brillant response to her Jesse inquiry.  "Well look at it. That's not how it started out, is it? Nothing natural about it," Penny, leaping to conclusion, sits on the edge of the tub leaving the toilet, seat and lid down, for Compton to sit on. "What is it... is it 'the word made flesh'? Fuck, Daze's never around .. " Then, "Gimme a cigarette."  Escalus has disconnected. Escalus has connected.  OOC> Escalus says "Sorry about that." OOC> Compton says "Sokie. I got a shower in at least. :D" OOC> Escalus had to disconnect because a patron came in. What were you doing? OOC> Compton says "No poses since you left. Penny and me are throwing out ideas as to whay our new found spirit thingy pet is." OOC> Escalus says "I will allow a int + occult roll, diff. 8." OOC> Penny says "ugh. BACK!" OOC> Penny's machine crashed like three times.  Compton frowns and just nods along to your stream of counsiousness, and offers a useless, "I don't know" here and there, before scowling at Penny, "You know... Sooner of later one of you kids will realize, I don't smoke, until that time let me give you a hint..." then his eyes unfocus a bit and he stares off in tot he void as his brain tries to grunt out a thought....  //.etro: Compton rolls "intelligence+occult" at diff 8          For a total of 0 success(es). No entry for '+roll'. OOC> Penny says "Me next?" ...and comes up with jack shit, as usual. OOC> Escalus says "Yep." //.etro: Penny rolls "intelligence + occult" at diff 8          For a total of 3 success(es) including 2 ten(s).  Penny remembers that spirit ephemera is essentially nothing until it gains a sort of resonance depending on what happens in the materials world around it. For example, a church that stood on a spot for 150 years gains a certain degree of reality in the spirit world, one that can continue after the material church is destroyed. Right?  "Old man," a whine, a warning. "It's not for me, I mean if I could just ask one'a them it'd be easier than staring at this thing all day." But that's what she does. Penny stares this way, that way. She looks up, she looks down; fixated on some central point of origin.  OOC> Escalus says "You follow me so far?" OOC> Penny follows. OOC> Compton does. OOC> Compton isn't quite as thick as his IC persona :P  Sentient spirits are products of millenia of that sort of spirit-material collusion. For example, lunes are spirits made by the connection between the material moon and the real moon, which is very potent in the mind and spirit of man.  This stuff is most probably spirit ephemera rendered neutral. The interaction between a material object and its spiritual counterpart has been removed, and the "imprint" of the soul's relationship between spiritual and material has been erased.  Compton frowns, grumbles and hauls his ass off the can and shuffles off out in to the rest of the room. The sounds of rummaging and things crashing to the floor can be heard as he ruthlessly looks for tobacco products. After a long quiet moment, he calls back, "And it wouldn't because you happened to be out of them, right?".  "No, not at all," looking at the walls. "Oh." "God." "That's why they were screaming."  Penny bends over a little to poke at what she can't touch, unable to interact with it, her fingers drift slowly across the empty tub. "It's ..it's clay. You know what this is old man? it's a fucking hard drive. It's a big block of memoryspace," she shivers and gets off the tub, goes to meet Compton halfway "it's empty. That's why they were screaming. All torn apart. Peter Pan and his shadow," making some kind of corollation she takes the cigarette from him and lights up on her own, matches tucked back into her pocket "You think I'd make a good Wendy?"  Compton tosses the pack he found back over by Keene's notebook. "OKay... well, I guess the next question is, why?"  Compton doesn't seem particularly upset by this. His connection to the spirit world having always eebn one of utility and not, um, spirit. He then guffaws, "Hee, Wendy."  Penny smirks a little, the hotel sewing kit in plain sight on the bathroom counter. "Obviously they're bent on getting something rooted in there good and proper. Solid-like. Stealing material like that, god. It's sick. Sick. There's gotta be karma for shit like that... "  Compton grabs the bag, and collects the gloves from the edge of the tub where he left them. Putting them in to the bag he gazes at the 'empty' tub and shrugs. "They're making a building from ectoplasim?" he asks trying to clairfy what you're babbling about.  Penny bobs her head back and forth, a veering nod "Kinda sorta, yeah. They're building something but they're doing it on a festering node. I dunno," waving a pattern of smoke around her face, leaning on the wall outside the bathroom "Something just isn't right. I mean that material BELONGS to something other than whatever new purpose they're trying to make it serve. Wouldn't wanna be around when it tries to repossess itself." She drags long and slow ".. not me, man. They're crazy."  Compton sratched at his forhead, thinking. Getting marks for effort, if not results on this one, "Right..." he says, "BUt They don't just do things for kicks like that. They doing it for a reason... Okay, so they got a sick node. And now they have a lot of blank ectoplasma. Either they are trying to make corrupted ephemera or a clean node." Points at the empty tub, "Ya think they're using this stuff as sponges?"  You say, "Sponges," repeats the word, musing "there's easier, less destructive ways of getting a spill cleaned up. If you had heard what I heard?" a hurting, a wincing lilt in the exhale "Maybe if we can get our hands on all this stuff first we can get it sorted. Think we should? Isn't creating a problem to fix a problem a problem in and of itself?"  Compton says, "I guess the next question is: How much of this stuff have they made?"  Penny walks across the room and opens the window, letting the air circulate back into the room. "I'm thinking a lot. Which means there's a lot of displaced information somewhere else." She ashes on the windowsill and leans there, kicking off her shoes. "Probably on that ship. Where the fuck did it go?"  Compton pads over to the far bed, and does the little hop-up flop-down on the bed. The coil protesting loudly.  > "Well... where did it come from? You're the one that saw it come in." Compton says, "And further more, what use would they have keeping the... 'other halfs' if this ectoplasm is all they wanted...If I were them I'd just dump it."  You say, "Deep space," she ashes again into the sill and presses her palm down for balance, balast. Her other boot comes off, focused inward a little "..but where do you dump something like that? Way the fuck out there, that's where. It's not like orange peels - the identity of a spirit can't just disintegrate."  "That's not what Daze said." Compton counters. "She said old spirits are fading away all the time. The Easter Bunny for example... but then she's usually full fo shit anyways. But assuming what she said is right, then dumping it somewhere would work as eventually it'd just fade... Unless they're reprocessing the other halves too... Hell, could even be using them for fuel." That last point can out far more erie than he meant.  Keene has connected. You say, "She thinks they fade outta unbelief - old gods, the Mithras cults, things like out. Fade outta disuse. But .. that's not what I meant. I'm saying they've still got some .." pinching her fingers, sliding them together "consistancy. That' block," nodding toward the bathrooom "that's proof. One can exist without the other but we don't know for how long and what the longterm effects are. Like I said.."  Compton tucks his thick arms under his head as an added pillow and gazes at the ceiling, "What did you say?" he asks distractedly.  Penny keeps rubbing her fingers against her thumb, laughing quietly to herself. In the grip of it, pin-points for eyes, Penny hasn't seen Keene come in. Penny is unaware. "I said I wouldn't wanna be there for the happy reunion of spirit'n blocky. Listen, we should definitely go back and get more. They're fucking with my bread and butter here."  "It'd be easier with some help." the big guy admits, "Will take a while to grab each one by hand. Could make a ecto-magnet or somthing. Just suck it all here in one go... But I thought you said you don wanna be around where the two rejoin, and won't you be if we fill the bathroom with it?"  There's a long silence. The ash on her cigarette burns down to the filter, singes her out of whatever reverie.  "You have a point."  "Maybe we can hide it on them. Put it somewhere they can't find it. They're playing dirty, is what, and I don't like it. Shouldn't be this easy for them. Why the fuck is it so easy for them?"  Compton snorts "Should dump it in the realm. Let those fuckholes actually do somthing useful for once."  "Fuckholes." Says something quietly, underneath the bed.  Penny stops moving altogether, filter falling from her hand.  "I.thought.you.said.it.was.in.the.fucking.closet."  Penny looks about ready to jump out the window. Compton is grinning now, "I never said anything actually.... Mornin Dave." Compton says out in to the room.  "I fucking hate you, I hate you I HATE you old man." She gets up in the windowsill, inching her hand down the wall to grab one of her boots. Paranoid, she does it fast and holds it close to her chin "Don't you let it near me. You hear, Dave? You leave me alone. I'm in no fucking mood."  Compton props hismself up on one elbow and looks on incrediously. He's seen Penny in most her moods. Even freaked out,but this is just bizzare, "What's the problem?"  Penny tucks the boot behind her and grabs the other one. Her eyes are narrowed, a dizziness overtakng her sense of center, Penny starts to keel off the sill. Wait. No. She's stepping down into the boot. She's grabbing the other one and putting it on "Dave. Don't come out Dave. I'm leaving. You hear me? Don't come out or I'll be forced to do something." All this said as she edges toward the door to the room.  Compton swings his legs off the bed and hunches down looking under it, "What's the big deal Pens? It's just a monkey..." he says in all ingnorance, as he sticks his hand underneight the bed to look for the lil guy....  > Yeow!" Compton screams, "Fucker bit me!" as he sits back holding his tender mit.  Penny murmurs "Fucking monkey," on her way out.

      Nothing to see here, move along...  Downtown - Parliament and Wellesley E(#179RJ)       Sitting on the edge of Cabbagetown, the homes here are nearly as old as those just south of here. However, the residents themselves are a little poorer. The old townhouses crunch together along the street, their dark-brown paint jobs chipping away to reveal the weakening wooden panels beneath. One-way streets become the norm here as well, creating no end of traffic problems. Residents park on the roadside since the homes here rarely have driveways. Small variety stores, grocery stores, hair-care salons and restaurants are all common here, all within easy walking distance of the residents of this area. With clean sidewalks, freshly paved roads and the newly added plants to create a comfortable air.  Contents: Laurie Obvious exits: Corso's Books   The Dubliner Pub  West   North  South   Laurie comes out of a corner market, holding a bag of groceries in each hand.  ...and Penny's walking up the block, piece of flimsy yellow paper in her hand. It's the kind of paper that rustles in a weak wind. Black or red print in numerous lines - phonebook paper. It's slow going for her, switched to decaf, half-lidded. She shields herself from the rain, the incessant and badgering rain, inside a few doorways always looking from paper to storefronts. Paper address. Physical address. Paper.    Laurie says "It's raining? O.o D'oh."  Laurie heads down the sidewalk, grumbling at the weather. She steps aside for teh woman with the coffee. Mmmm... coffee. Note to self. Get coffee.  Laurie read your description.  The paper is getting wet, no way around it; the weather's way too foul to keep anything dry. Penny realizes this and makes-do, flattens the paper to the nearest wall and squints at it. Looks up over her shoulder at the numbers on the door, rain washing over her face from the ill-tempered awning; it shakes and bucks, shimmies and rattles its grommets - a flagpole sound. The paper leaves her grip, pulled with wet and brutal efficiency by the wind. Suddenly empty-handed, Penny falters. Which way does she go now?  Laurie approaches Penny, looking around confused. "You okay?" she asks, adjusting her grip on the plastic bags.  "I was looking for a salon. Ladynails," she explains carefully in drawn out words, the last syllable lifted upwards in questioning "that around here? I had an early appointment." Penny positions herself back into the doorway of a closed shop, serves as a kind of umbrella.  Laurie says, "Oh, yeah. It's just on the next block... Go down to the stoplight, here, and turn left..." Laurie gestures with one hand, towards the other end of the street.  "Kay thanks," Penny moves on faster than other people. She's got somewhere to be; a path, a plan, a course of action.

      **Went out and found some more work for us. Don't get to kill anything, but have an IC excuse to rough up a Wraith called Tia Sharpe. Could tie in with the Mary plot... Also go to mouth off Connelly. Generally got ignored. Funny how timid the RP can be if you come on strong.**  You walk out of the cave, your eyes adjusting to the bright sunlight. Entering the grasses of the field, you walk for a ways, until you have reached the highest peak. Rolling Fields          It's a gorgeous sight, even in the dark of night, the brilliant yellows and greens of tall grasses waving in the chill wind, rolling hills stretching off as far as the eye can see. Pure, white stars shine in the breaks of the thick, dark cloud cover above, bringing a mild, yet still chilled, warmth to the vast expanse of land.         As you reach the peak of one of the highest hills, you are able to survey the land as the scent of life washes over you. Almost ninety degrees from the hill with the huge, gaping hole, and far off into the distance there is a massive forest, several deer darting into the trees as you spot it, as if sensing your discerning eye. Immediately opposite it is a large body of water, from which the cave stream flows. Ninety degrees from it, directly opposite the cavern entrance, there rest the ruins of a large stone complex, resting atop another hill, one lone tower being all that remains of the once-majestic structure.         A little off to the northeast (assuming the ruins are north), a small, metallic-bowl structure sits. Long tethers sometimes stretch into the sky from beyond it, connecting to a marvelous airship docked above the bowl. The slender curves and high-tech metals used on the small building are a stark contrast to the ruins just fifty yards away, and it easily gives away who is responsible for such a building.                                  >                                  Contents: Standingwater Cally Viktor Paksenarrion Connelly Obvious exits: Novus Valnastium    The Living Forest    Clear Lake    Hole in the Hill    High-Tech Workshop     Compton tromps out of the cave. His pants all soggy and sodden from his inter-dimensional splunkering to get here. As always, he looks right pissed off having to do it.  Connelly smiles and shakes her head, smirking a little.."So..Viktor...did you go on the rescue mission? I mean..no-one has told me exactly who all went.."  Viktor leans his head to the side so Connelly can see him past Cally and says, "Yeah. It was very interesting... It reminded me very much of a strange science fiction movie. I regret I could not do much, but  I helped transport our party through the natural diasters of the shaken Realm."  Cally looks to Viktor and smiles.. "I'd like that too,.. she walks over to the note Standingwater wrote and hmms.. "what sort of Expert you looking for?  Standingwater hitches his pack up a little on his shoulder. "Can you track down a dead chick? Maybe make her hold still while I put an arrow through her heart?"  Cally hmms.. "dunno if I can, but.. I's sure like to try and be assistance./. this been oked with Jonah? the removal of tia I mean?  Compton flattens a path of grass with his loafers as me marches his way down the hill. A direct line from the 'hole' to the gathering being made.  Standingwater spits to one side before he replies. "I really don't care what El Queso Grande wants. I'm answering to a higher power here. Though I'm sure he'll approve since the Spirit Council met with him about it."  Connelly frowns, and looks at Standinwater.."Standingwater....Why don't you go ask a Euthanatos? They deal with the dead all the time..."  Cally looks at Viktor.. "how about it? Want to join us on this?  Compton stops short of barreling in to anyone, but his bristling demeanor and direct approach leave little to guess as to why he's come. "Got the message." he states blankly, obviously only intended for one person. "My cabal specializes in controlling or eradicating what you seek." he says in his gravelly voice. He's practiced this opening.  Viktor looks between the big group and then finally, back at Cally... How can he resist? He looks to Standingwater and says, "Tracing, tracking, and finding, are my specialty, but I'm afraid I know nothing about the spirits 'ere what my library can tell me. If I work with someone, I could indeed track her, and possibly slow her, or stop her with the power of forces."  Standingwater pinches the bridge of his considerable nose. "Where was all this help when I needed it to deal with that spider beast? Which is still at large and likely babbling our secrets, by the way." Nose pinching done, he eyes Compton. "And you are...?"  Cally smiles.. "well I'm not quite an adept on the paranormal world but.. I do have more then a slight knowledge.. " she looks up at Standingwater. "so how about it? Can you use us?  "I, er, Compton... Invisible College." Compton falters a little, having run out of his predetermined lines, "Keene, as usual is... busy."  Standingwater pinches the bridge of his nose again and mutters darkly under his breath in one of the dozen or so languages he speaks that no one here is likely to know. What was that all about?  Connelly frowns at Compton,"I thought the Invisible College specialized in causing car accidents?  Cally shrugs at the foreign tongue.. of course to her even french is foreign.. "so how about it? Can you use us?  Viktor stifles a chuckle at Connelly's comment and studies the newcomer for a moment. He then looks at   Cally and smiles, seeming happy that shes a persistent gal. He stands closer to her and whispers something to her.  Viktor whispers to Cally.  Compton shifts his gaze sideways at Connelly and stiffens more, "Shuddup bitch." he says with all the grace of someone verbally sparring with a baseball bat.  Standingwater gets this pained expression, which he mostly wipes away with a longsuffering sigh. "Any help will do. There's no grand plan. If you can find her, find her. Grab me by the hair and drag me off to where she is. I'll put this arrow through her and go back to my life of leisure."  "This all pro-bono?" Compton asks, already assuming the answer.  Paksenarrion coughs and looks at Compton as he comments to Connelly, "Beg pardon?"  Connelly frowns,"Paksen...let it go...when they get shot up or something...I will just let them treat themselves..By the way..which of them went with you to Doisettep?  Cally uhms.,. "find her.. well I may need some assistance. I mean I barely know the story Viktor nods. He looks between everyone and says to Standingwater. "If I have someone that can locate spirits, then finding a way past our unique focis, we might stand a chance of locating the ghost. Is there anything else about her as far as looks or personality or anything that might help us locate her?"  Standingwater shakes his head. "Not a clue. She's dead. She's the daughter of a Marauder. Her name is Tia Sharpe. Maybe Abel can tell you more. He met her."  "All you need is the name... A spook is just a spirit... that's all you need." Compton explains in an impatient deadpan.  Paksenarrion makes a face and settles back into a sitting position  Cally looks at Paksen.. "what do you think? think we can do this?  Connelly looks at Paksen quietly...not looking like she likes what is being talked about....  Viktor looks at Standingwater quizically all of sudden. "So what exactly happens when the chair is sat on again? I think you failed to mention that."  Paksenarrion glances over towards Cally, "Do what exactly? You'll forgive me but I was a little distracted at the time."  Standingwater spreads his arms to indicate the realm around him. "All this goes bye-bye. Big boom. Then nothing."  Compton, after many silent moments watching the group in seemingly quiet reflection or murmuring private conversations pipes up with, "Right then. Spook on a stick. We'll be in touch." and turns to lumber back up the hill. Obviously places he'd much rather be, most likely involving a beer and naked jiggling flesh.  Cally says, "well? you wanna help us find Jamaia's spook?" she turns to Jamaia.. "By the way, how she die anyway?""  Viktor pages: what a perverted old hipster...  Standingwater shrugs helplessly, "I haven't had a chance to ask her."  Connelly frowns.."I know someone who could maybe help you, Standingwater...."  You have just received a +recc from Viktor.  Who +recc'd you  When        Why ---------------  ----        --- Viktor           Tue Apr 15  For mini-intro and an insight into /what/                               the Invisible College does  Paksenarrion shakes her head, "I don't think I would be much help in that endevour.."  Standingwater scowls at the sky. "At this point I wouldn't care if the guy with the most iron teeth and plastic bones helps. I just want to get this job done so I can go back to the forest where I belong." Viktor mutters something along the lines of, "I'll get started right away in that case..."  Connelly nods..."Standingwater..do you know a local artist named Mary? She...sees ghosts...."  Compton huffs his way up the hill, his form growing smaller in the distance, but that gaudy shirt keeping him well within eyeshot if one cares to look. Q: Where does one even find things like that to wear any more? A: The Toronto enigma, Value Village.  Heading down the hill and up the other, you enter the cavern's dark entrance.

      Imogen pages: Sorry to disturb you, I wanted to include you into the scene I'm about to run here. but YOu're in a building. This has to occur on the street. You paged Imogen with 'I am?'. Waterfront - Yonge and Queens Quay(#1102RJ)  OOC Imogen waves OOC Penny waves  Imogen pages: I know some of this will be some OOC info, but here's what's happened from me thusfar Imogen pages: The dismal rain begins to fall from the sky as twilight approaches the city. Within the Shadowlands the terrain is even more bleak as it's tainted with the effects of Oblivion. Through the streets, dreary looking Quick travel as through burdened by the weight of the world on their backs.  The occasional car passes down the road, when a loud banging sound is heard and echoes through the Shadowlands from somewhere just around the corner.  Imogen pages: I believe I will have to page you with what you see, I regret the inconvenience. :( I will soon create a command that will make all this flow more easily.)  Imogen pages: The effects of what's about to occur will happen in the Skinlands You paged Imogen with 'Ah!'. Long distance to Imogen: Penny sits tight, then. Imogen pages: Any chance you saw that last pose? You paged Imogen with 'Nope.'.  Imogen pages: The twilight air of Toronto heralds with it a light rain. The city street is mostly vacant except the occasional passing car. One such vehicle begins to come near the intersection in which you stand. The driver looks awake, but exhausted from a typical day at work.  You paged Imogen with 'Should I pose outloud or to you..'. Imogen pages: Please pose outloud. If you want to do anything 'special' during this scene, just page that info to me    No umbrella, no raincoat. That's some plan of action Penny's got. She looks at the sky with some misgiving and slouches her way toward a nearby overhang. But the doors keep opening and people keep edging her out of the way. She tries to light up a few times, moves into a doorframe with a 'FERME' sign flipped. Pressing back into it, she strikes a match and watches the people start to scatter off; catching buses, hailing cabs and pooling themselves into the subways.  Imogen pages: Mere seconds later, the vehicle is lurched into chaos. The driver flings his arms around wildly as though suffering horrible hallucinations or just basically 'freaking out'. The tires squeal and the car arches hard off the street proper to barrel down the sidewalk. 4 Pedestrians who turn startled by the sound shriek in terror as the car rolls quickly towards them.  Long distance to Imogen: Penny has a rote she'd like to use. Simple: smoke signal - she breathes out the enochian word for 'Over here' and spirits in the penumbra talk to her, tell her what's going on. Imogen pages: Ok, what spirit will you attempt to contact? What animal? You paged Imogen with 'Any, really. It's not a totem kinda thing. She's just putting it out there that she's watching and wants to know what's happening.'. Imogen pages: I believe it's an Arete roll vs 6.   Long distance to Imogen: Penny nods. //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Imogen at diff 6. For a total of 3 success(es).  Imogen pages: Some of the people are too slow, and they are caught under the wheels of the out of control car and it's lunatic driver. Moments after running down 2 of them the car collides with a light pole standing near to the road. The red spray of crimson mist splatters along the windshield and steering wheel. Cries announce from those nearby and some of the patrons of nearby establishments rush out from the noise to find out what's going on.  Imogen pages: The spirit detects nothing unnatural going on nearby. If anything is going on, it's within a realm that the spirit cannot sense. You paged Imogen with 'Excellent.'.  Penny drags hard, exhales harder and keeps frozen inside the doorway. It's true what they say about carwrecks - you just can't turn away. Her gaze travels from the mowed down people to the car to the lightpole. Caught there, she yells at people emerging from doors and windows, presumably with a lot of other voices "Don't! That's a live wire! Get back!" murmuring to herself something mean and subtle about dumb frogs, lurching from the recess suddenly to turn to those nearby "GET BACK."  Imogen pages: Individuals are smart, but peoplethey're stupid. Luckily the morbid nature of most of the population tends to make them all observers rather than to actually get involved when something horrific is occurring around them. So most just circle around the car gawking at the pleasant red color trickling down the car's glass. Some raise their hands to cover their mouths but at least one of them has the common sense to grab a phone.  OOC Imogen says "Pending on Penny, I believe" Takoda arrives from the north. Takoda has arrived.  Penny looks at her phone once, then up to the accident and tucks it back to that inner pocket of her jacket. Who would she call? She looks out at the crowd again and shuffles people behind her with an assertiveness of an old hand; crowd control doesn't come naturally but who'll argue with a shaved woman? That's right - not these nice, normal people. Herded away, some cry at the horror and happenstance of it all. When questioned later some may say "He just came out of nowhere," and "I was just leaving work" - they rehearse these things among themselves as Penny leaves them, against better judgement, to get a better look at the plates of the car. Or something.  //.etro: Imogen rolls "4" at diff 6 For a total of 3 success(es).  Lights. Red and Blue and White and Yellow: That's the first thing that comes to view. And then a Forest green SUV comes barrelling down the road, slowing as it approaches what looks to be... Well, a mess. Slowing down, so as not to hurt another pedestrian, the SUV, with the White Stenciled letters, 'Parn Warden' stops a number of yards from the actual accident. The vehicle is turned off, but the lights remain flashing, and out steps Takoda. "Fuck." He mutters to himself, before he states, while exiting the car, over the Dispatch channel, "This is officer Wanikiya arriving on scene, requesting immediate Emergancy aid and backup. We've got a crowd."  //.etro: Imogen rolls "3" at diff 5 For a total of 1 success(es).  EMS Units sound their sirens down the street. The echo of the wail reverberates through the buildings accompanied shortly afterwards by the police.  Well of course there's a crowd. It's rush hour, there's dead people on the pavement and no cops in sight .. except the park ranger.  Penny looks around for other gawkers to blend with, catches the tail end of some Eaton Center shopper-crowd and walks with them. She talks quietly with one of the tourists, pointing at her camera. The pantomime under the noise could be read a few ways; either she wants Penny to take a picture of her or is giving the camera to Penny.  Takoda finishes his statement, before he jogs over to the first of the downed pedestrians. "Everybody please stay back." He shouts, as people draw closer, and he bends down to check the person's pulse. His movements belay a certain grace, a comfort in his own body that few people manage to achieve. Any sign of authority is 'something' and the flashing lights of his SUV appear to give Takoda some authority. Most of the pedestrians move back, but remain within eyeshot.  The order in the area is, of course, objective. Any kind of Canadian crowd'll have it's hecklers and it's shriekers; it's weeping and its morbidly curious. In this burgeoning, Penny focuses the polaroid on the car, snaps off one shot, then hands it back to the sweaty-palmed tourist with another brief exchange. Thank-yous, some might opine and be right. She pockets the picture before it develops and edges around the crowd. The question on everyone's lips is "Is the driver still alive?"  //.etro: Jeff rolls for Initiative: wits + dex + 1d10 -> 11 Tex arrives from the north. Tex has arrived. //.etro: Imogen rolls "8" at diff 6 For a total of 1 success(es).  More sirens wail in the distance, but one squad car screeches to a sudden halt as it approaches the scene. The crowd of onlookers earns a scowl from Tex, as he steps from his awkwardly parked car. He approaches the wrecked vehicle and the crowd, taking his badge out, and tucking it in his coat pocket to identify him as a officer.  OOC Penny says "It's Takoda's pose, yeah?" OOC Takoda says "Yes, I was waiting on something.:)" //.etro: Imogen rolls "2" at diff 6 For a total of 1 success(es) including 1 ten(s).    Tom has arrived. Tom goes back IC.  Takoda steps up from the first person on the sidewalk, seeming to be content with the heartbeat of that individual. The second one gets a glance, as the woman moans. "Don't worry Ma'am, EMT's are on their way." He says closer to her, bending down for a moment to examine her, before he finally moves to the car. He whips out a flashlight, and shines it inside to take another quick one over, reaching inside to place his fingers on the driver's neck. Again, he nods, and steps back, glancing over as Tex arrives, speaking into his walkie-talkie on his shoulder. "This is officer Wanikiya, I have two wounded, another critically. Please send additional EMT assistance."  Wool coat tossed loosely over his shoulders, Tom seems to be exiting from the Liquor Store, a little unawares of the whole situation. Perhaps a slight fog - narcotic or alcoholic or just the moisture in the air acting on his sinuses - acts on his senses. Regardless, he looks slightly dazed by the scene of disorder that confronts him once he's exited the store. In a mild state of shock, he hefts up the brown paper bag full of clanking beer bottles he has gathered into one arm. Numbly, he wanders a half-circle, eyes not failing to notice the spray of blood across the front windshield. Mouth half-opens, releases a semi-conscious, "Jesus... fucking... downright awful."  Tex peers at the vehicle, to see if he can spot any gas leaking from vehicle. Fluids are everywhere...no telling if petrol is involved. Turning to the crowd of onlookers, who carefully approach the accident scene. "Get back!" he barks to the people, stalking towards them like a predator. "Get the hell back!" he barks again. His attitude and tone of voice suggest he'll brook no mischief from anyone.  Penny keeps looking up, waiting for the damaged light pole to fall. Penny, pending doom. She drops back another few feet, bumping into people when the officer raises his voice. She keeps her head down, reaching behind her neck, tugging out the hooded part to cover up. "Is he? Did they say?" someone on a cellphone keeps asking Penny - like she's some authority on who lives and dies in the street. "Look, I dunno. Ask that guy, he's the cop yeah?" nodding over to Tex.  Takoda read your description.  Takoda looks over to Tex, nodding to the man in gratitude, before he leans back down again, into the car. "Sir, sir, can you hear me? Emergancy services are on their way sir, you're gonna be alright..." He meanwhile shines his flashlight around inside the car, looking for any passangers, or any signs of mischief.  The driver appears to have lost consciousness. Trauma to the head from impact with the Steering wheel then the glass Obviously not wearing his seat belt correctly.  As Tex barks at the crowd, Tom dutifully withdraws. Either shame or common sense (or, perhaps, both) prevails in getting him to take his eyes away from the whole reprehensible, compelling, disheartening scene. He paces the outskirts of the crowd, hugging foreign beers to his chest, scanning the faces of his fellow onlookers, eyes burning, alight; a penetrating gaze.  Tex reaches into his pocket, and produces a set of car keys. "Don't get any closer!" he tells the crowd in a gravel-scratch voice. He runs to the trunk of his car, and opens it. He rummages around inside, and produces a duffel kit, and the typical roll of yellow tape. He runs back to the crowd to ensure that his orders were complied with. "Officer, don't let that guys head move. Keep tabs on his pulse." he asks the man. He drops the duffel bag, and finds a mailbox to tie some tape off too. "And get a E.T.A. on our medical." he says. He has a feeling that the driver dosen't have very long.  The lights of the Ambulance herald in the EMS. It's approach is slow, yes but here it is. Once it grinds to a halt 3 Emergency technicians exit carrying their gurney and move quickly to the site of the crash.  "Gotchya." Takoda states, making sure to make no sudden movements near the man's head. It's rather obvious he isn't quite used to this sort of situation, but seems to be handling it just fine. "ETA is any minute..." His voice trails off as the ambulance arrives. When the EMT's begin to head over, he steps back from the vehicle, glancing down at his bloodied hand, from checking the driver's pulse.  Penny turns a shoulder to the scene when the ambulance finally arrives, its sirens heralding help. Seems to be an effective way to get people moving again, restoring order to the momentarily paralysis of the commuting public. She shudders, touching her way through the pedestrians, kindling side-to-side glances; who touched me? what was that? was that you? No it wasn't; just Penny in wake, shaking out the polaroid.  Imogen pages: That still will be probably worth some money with the local newspaper. :) Imogen pages: still=photo, whatever. :) Long distance to Imogen: Penny images it would be. What's it show us? Imogen pages: When did you take it? Long distance to Imogen: Penny scrolls up. You paged Imogen with 'Right before Jeff's roll. And exactly before Tex arrived.'.   Jaw squared off, Tom's pale eyes twist away from the crowd. There's something in the reflections on their eyes he doesn't like to look at. The blood - or maybe the strange, gaping sort of hunger. If not for blood, than for information, than for a story to watch. A generation of people grown up on car chases and wrecks in the movies now avidly consuming real life as though it were entertainment. As though it were sold to them, and they were buying. An easy walk carries him away from the scene, towards his car, parked an alarmingly close distance away. Moistening his dry bottom lip, he struggles to keep his legs still, keep the tremble out until he's safe in his car and on the road.  One Emergency care technician exits the van and moves to Tex to find out the details of the situation. The 3 that exited earlier divide and each attends one of the fallen victims of the accident. One to each person that was run over, then another to the driver. Once there he says to Takoda, "Thank you sir, I have it from here."  A yellow barricade of tape is erected slowly, with room left for EMT's to do their job. Tex runs the tape along his own pre-set path, moving pedestrians and traffic out of his way rather roughly, if they do not comply. A few zig-zags later, he ties off the tape and a established accident scene is created. That being done, he lets the EMTs do thier job, and he can really begin his. A notepad and pencil are pulled from his coat. "Who can tell me what happened here? Did anyone see the accident?" he barks out to the crowd of onlookers. Someone here saw what happened, he's sure.  Takoda seems again, relieved that the EMT has taken over. He steps back from the car, clicking his flashlight off, slipping it into a small clot on his belt. Clicking the pouch closed, he glances about once more, before he heads slowly towards his SUV, parked just outside of the Police yellow tape. his Red and blue flashing lights still do their thing, and he leans into the open driver's side door to remove a small white metal box. Opening it, he pull sout some sterile towels, and a bottle of disinfectant, and goes to work on his hand.   Imogen pages: Lets see, within the SKinlands you coudl have gotten a picture  of whatever you like. :) Should anything 'special' be done with the photo so see other realms I've noted what would be on the still.  //.etro: Imogen rolls "8" at diff 4 For a total of 7 success(es) including 2 ten(s). //.etro: Imogen rolls "1" at diff 2 For a total of 1 success(es).  You paged Imogen with ''nother roll maybe?'. Imogen pages: Sure thing if you like.  //.etro: Arlen rolls for Initiative: wits + dex + 1d10 -> 11   //.etro: Imogen rolls "1" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). //.etro: Arlen rolls "strength + 3" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es). //.etro: Imogen rolls "7" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es).  Order is established, or at least to the satisfaction of Tex. He starts taking statments from the witnesses to the accident. The EMT is privy to what's being said, to avoid any confusion. And to save Tex the time of having to re-tell the same story.  Imogen pages: Anything for me?  With the beer secure in the passenger seat, Tom pulls on his safety belt. Makes sure the damn thing is extra tight, adjusted correctly, his seat isn't loose, the steering column is tilted to best prevent injury... once he's satisified that his mirrors are in a state of relative symmetry, he starts the car and begins to pull away. Pressing the play button on his CD player, he tries to sink into the relaxing sounds of a Phil Collins CD that came with the car. As he mouths the words to Su-su-sudio, he does his best to put the whole awful event out of mind.

      Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber.          This room is mostly empty, even more vast in some ways than the hall outside. Only three things mar its granite perfection; a perfect marble table at the head of the room with nine chairs, each marked with a single Sphere glyph, a perfectly inscribed Certamen circle in the center of the room, and perhaps forty seats at the back of the room, for observers and audience. A single door to the left glows a soft gold.          The great marble table seems designed with the center chair in mind. Polished and pristine, the table stands as if it had stood here for an eternity, perfectly circular save the path which leads from between the Seat of Entropy and the Seat of Prime to the new Seat, it's unknown symbol shining a warm golden hue.                            >                           Contents: Alexandre Rhiamon Aaron Jonah Obvious exits: Left Door    Out      Alexandre nods, "I left it in the Covenant Library, with Agnetta, for safe-keeping, though I'm sure that Jane has secured it." He smiles knowingly at Rhiamon.  Jonah nods slowly, "It is a possibility that the version you have found may have differences. Each was hand-written, after all."  Compton staggers in, looking rosy cheeked and disheveled. A Paper bag wrapped bottle hanging from his limp hand.  Cally has connected.  Rhiamon has reconnected. Rhiamon has partially disconnected.  Cally nods to Alexandre favoring a warm smile. "Yes I have. I was studying on how to interact with the spirit realm more directly.  Aaron chuckles at something and shakes his head a little, picking up his laptop and slipping from the table  Cally nods to Jonah. "Hello Mageistar  Compton clamps one eye shut, and tries hard to focus from the other one, looking in to the room as if looking through a fishbowl. His countenance frowns and he manages an 'Aww damn...' while swaying in the door way.  Alexandre's attention is diverted by Compton. He stares at him, watching him stagger in. He seems to sigh, just the barest of sighs, before returning to look at Jonah and Rhiamon, "I would like to hear about the differences, if there are any."  Aaron pauses on his way to the door and glances back to Jonah, "Pushing this guy over look bad on the Tribunal?", obviously talking about Compton  Jonah stands slowly, collecting his cane as he does. He grants a nod to Alexandre. "I will inform you of the differences as soon as possible. For now, I must leave." A frown, however, is given to Aaron. "Mr. Michaels, show courtesy to your fellow magi. And, Mr. Compton, please try to be sober on occasion when you visit this place, for the same reasons."  Jonah stands and leaves The Council Table.  Jonah makes his way to the double doors, "Good day, everyone." With that, he leaves.  Compton just looks plain ole confused. First at Aarons comment, as if trying to discern his point, and then at Jonah's as if trying to conjour an excuse... or at least his reason for being here in the first place. All of this fails though and he simply stands there on his sea legs.  Jonah has disconnected.  Cally cocks her head and smiles. "So. what's up"?  Aaron nods and passes Compton iwith a light pat on the shoulder Aaron steps back out to the main hall. Aaron has left.  Compton goes to ask Aaron something as he passes by, but takes so long he misses his chance, now he just looks blankly in to the room as states 'The John?' to anyone listening.  Cally cocks her head. "the.. john? err Bathroom? I.. don't know where it is right now sorry." Cally shakes her shoulder looking confused  Alexandre apparently is listening, stating, "Outhouse is in the back. No indoor plumbing." Then looks to  Cally and offers, "Foray into the Shard Realm of Forces. Fought giant worms and the Fallen. Rescue captives. Trying to figure out the lineage of a book. Standard stuff."  Cally blinks? you.. made it to the planet Mars? and never got words to me? "  Rhiamon smiles wryly, "A lot of poeple are saying that. It was kinda we grabbed people who were there.."  Cally sits down. Now she's the one that looks confused. "Uhm.. can you start from minute 1 please? Alexandre nods to Cally, "It was more than a bit of an emergency. Those who were immediately available were grabbed."  Compton /leans/ up against the door like it is going to save him from drowning, and just closes his eyes tight. Giving up on the whole concentrating on the outside world for a bit.  Cally glances over to Compton.. Ok.. she doesn't know his name but.. "Are you allright? Need someplace to sit? you look a little ill." Compton without opening his eyes simply assumes that the girl is talking to him, and extends his hand waving away and offers of help - obviously he's used to this kind of attention, and doesn't brook with it much. "Isssalright. Jus need a moment." he replies.  Cally ahs softly and looks at Alexandre and Rhiamon.. maybe they can help him or explain. one of the two. Besides she's still wanting an explanation for what happened.  Rhiamon ponders, regarding her left-hand nails, but then relaxes. People seem to get so...testy when blasted by sleet...  Alexandre watches Compton, distracted from regaling his stories of giant worms. He takes a few distracted steps towards Compton, asking, "Perhaps you should get some rest? You don't look good."  l alex         This is a man, not young anymore but not yet middle-aged, sporting black, thin-rimmed circular glasses, with tussled dark brown hair, medium length on the top, short in the back. He has an olive complexion and dark brown eyes, possibly of Mediterranean descent. He has high cheekbones and a thin face, a nose thats a little hawkish, but otherwise plain featured. He has a slight frame and measures an average height.         He wears a dark blue turtleneck and blue jeans. He wears earrings, small, simple silver hoops, in both ears. A couple rings, with red and blue gems, add color to his fingers. A black satchel bag hangs on his shoulder.  Compton heaves open a bloodshot eye and glares back at the now increasing unwanted attention, "Ya think I wanna be here, pasty?" he asks, now getting irritated.  Cally decides not to say anything. she glances back to Alexandre.. ""so.. you were saying something about guests?"  Alexandre tilts his head slightly, "I don't know. I'm not a mind reader. But what I do see is that it looks like someone is going to lose everything in their stomach. And that concerns me. It isn't healthy. "    Cally sighs and sorries. she's getting sleepy as well   Rhiamon just dosed off herself. Sounsd goo dto me Rhiamon has disconnected.  Compton nods again; closing his eyes, and rolls his hand over a few times, motioning to carry on. "A someone not breathing would probably alarm you too, but that doesn't mean it's not normal" he says in a brief moment of clarity, "Tell your stories."    Cally waves Cally has disconnected.  Compton obviously nodded off there, as the next time he opens his eyes, most everybody's gone. "Aww, damn..." he says to himself mostly, grinding the palm of his hand in to one eye. The other hanging on to that bottle as if by magnetism.  Alexandre replies, "Well, not breathing is normal, if you aren't alive." He pauses, then suggests, "If, however, we're talking about you and me, I would be alarmed. If you're saying I shouldn't be alarmed because you throw up regularly, that only alarms me more."  Compton looks real confused for a second or two, as he flips through the card catalog of his short term memory, until he finds a match, "Because that isn't normal for you?" he asks. Obviously put off a little by the direction your point was leaning.  Alexandre offers, "Because it isn't normal for most people." He smiles gently, then looks serious once more. . "I'm still not getting the point..." Compton says obtusely. "You say you are worrying because I am not like the next guy?" He looks truly dumbfounded now as he reaches for the golden nugget on this one.  Alexandre replies, "You probably aren't getting the point because you're drunk and can't tell here from there." He shakes his head slightly, then says, "So when will you finally drink yourself to death? Is that your point?"  "Fuck man," Compton says exasperated, "You sound like Alyx, with all your black and white (makes a 'quotation mark motion with his hands) 'obvious' rules to living a better lifestyle..." he pauses, raises the poorly obfuscated bottle and takes a belt, when he talks again surprisingly sounds more coherent, "Quite frankly, I'm shocked that so many of the enlightened have such a narrow focus on the possible. Perhaps some drink, or shoot, or fuck around to live... What is above so below, and thus some must mirror the opposite to society around them. What is bad is good."  Wow. For those that don't know, that was a hell of a lot of babble from the normally stoic guy.  Alexandre shakes his head slightly, "Some drink, but we're not always babbling drunk. Some of us have sex, but we don't hump everything that moves. And really, you just showed that you're desire to mirror the opposite is just some mid-life crisis reason to do whatever you wanted to do anyway."  You say, "So you, like everyone else that hides up here in your extra-dimensional club house feels the need to make a ruling on someone else's life, hand down divine bits of unsolicited wisdom because.... You /love/ me?"  Compton is sobering fast, although the bottle makes a few more trips to his lips between comments. He's not pleased. What could be mistaken for righteous anger seems to be building in him, of course unless you knew him and then would think such a thing is not only unlikely, but damn near impossible.  Alexandre watches you for a few moments, watching you get riled up. Doesn't say anything for a few more moments, then says, "I suggested you lay down. You chose to insult me. If you could mistake that for love, you are more drunk than I thought."  Alexandre has reconnected.  And with that the fire goes out and the sullen-ness returns to his features. Compton draws what looks like a couple of Polaroid's from his shirt pocket and eyes them for a second, then you, then quietly replaces them from where they came. "Ya know? I honestly don't know why Keene cares so much to help you guys. Help you'd reject because you don't like the massager's shirt." and with that turns to go. The swagger gone and his footsteps merely heavy.  Alexandre watches you turn, walk away. Rubs his chin, then offers, "I hope you have a good rest." He looks to the walls, then opens his satchel and begins to rummage.  "No you don't." Compton reply's in a depressed Eyore kind of way and he's off.  You step back out to the main hall.

      Pub - The Dubliner(#4865RXJM)       A haze hangs upon the air within the confines of these walls. It is a  mixture of smoke, the kind that is emitted by the raspy cough of a habitual  smog-puffing derelict. Several paneled pillars rise from warped wooden planks  to the ceiling above. Though old and the room dimly lit the floor planks are  squeaky clean. A long bar runs the north wall with a multitude of stools. Too  many have ripped seat covers with tufts of white cottony fabric peeking out  from beneath the vinyl. Some have been patched with duct tape. Most all of the  chairs, surrounding their scarred oaken tables, are in the same condition.      A lone pool table resides at the back of the room upon an elevated  platform. Numerous barstools line the counter that runs the circumference of  this section. The table was once a fine piece of wood craftsmanship until the  occasional knife stroked its surface with violence. The felt has so many pills  upon the surface that it rivals any sweater within the known world      Throughout the bar beautiful coloured pictures of Ireland are posted on  the walls along with large colourful posters advertising Irish beer and  beverages. The crowded dance floor in the middle of the bar is always full of  people dancing jigs and singing loudly along with the vibrant music. The dance  floor itself is scuffed and worn bare from all the dancing feet. Everyone in  here seems to be loud and rowdy, all of them drunk. Fistfights often break out  though not usually right near the bar.                                   NIGHTZONE                                                                                          Contents: Alexander Seamus  Alexander opens the padded door and enters the pub. Alexander has arrived.  Alexander wanders into the pub accompanied by two dirty looking fellows. By the markings on their clothes, they could be gangers or bikers. Turning to face them once they have entered, he lays his hand on one of the men's shoulders. Exchanging some words, the both of them steps back outside before much more attention then that surrounding the entrance has befallen them. Alone, he proceeds over to the counter.  Alexander read your description.    In the back of the bar, Penny continues to add nothing but haze to the atmosphere, her cigarette in an ashtray. The loss of interest is mutual, in a moment it will snuff itself out, ash and a lack of oxygen overtaking the tiny orange ember. It will happen most likely in the same minute she chooses to answer the phone she left on top of the table next to the ashtray. She watches it vibrate on the table in its holder, shuttling back and forth like a demented mexican jumping bean.   Alexander lays his hand in what might be interpreted as an instrusive manner over the arm of a waitress just recieving an order from the bartender. He says something quietly to her, making sure to hold onto her arm for the five second long speech. Proceeding across the room, he slows beside your table, although not apparing as if it was his destination, rather he was just about to pass it. He eyes you, then cellphone, and you again. Reaching his hand down, he aims to pick it up and answer it.  Isobel opens the padded door and enters the pub. Isobel has arrived.  //.etro: It is 9:20 pm, late evening, on Friday the 12. day of December, 2008. Isobel slips into the pub and moves towards the door, lifting a hand to wave as Seamus looks up Isobel sits down at the bar.  Isobel leans forward as she slides onto the bar stool, speaking in her soft Irish brogue she sounds a lot like most of the regulars, or not depending on if you are a regular yourself, "hello there Seamus, I would be having a pint" she then sits back in the curve of the worn bar stool and glances about  Where would we be without the happy hour? In barbaric times, that's where.  There's not a chance the guy that got up from the table near Penny's is going to make it to the door before he collapses; been here since 4 by the stink of him and as he collapses into Alexander he grins, goofing "Hey g'lookin'.." and hiccups before passing out on the floor. Common enough for this bar that nobody really turns. Common enough that it doesn't phase Penny. She's just watching the phone. And then it stops ringing, lopsides itself on the far side of the ashtray and everything's back to normal.  Isobel reaches out and snags the pint as it begins to slide its way towards her. Grinning her thanks she takes a sip and then once again glances around the smoke filled bar. Pausing now and then as something entertaining or odd catches her attention. In this place there is plenty of that. Washed and unwashed it would appear  Alexander looks slightly bothered. But just slightly. Brushing his hand once in a dismissive kind of motion over his jacket where the man touched him, he takes a wide step over the drunken patron. The waitress he spoke with just a moment ago is motions towards, and he takes a seat by the table opposite of Penny.  Alexander sits down at the shadowy corner booth. Alexander joins you.  Anupra has arrived. [OOC] Anupra peeks in. "Room for one more?" [OOC] Penny says "Why the hell not." //.etro: Penny rolls "willpower" at diff 6          For a total of 2 success(es).  Isobel smiles as she spots a rather unusual and indeed amazing sight, even in Dublin not many have pink hair. She observes for another moment and then loosing interest takes another sip. Just glad to relax Anupra read your description.  Stepping up and in from outside, leaning heavily on her cane with each step, comes Anupra. She peers around the irish-themed bar for a moment, straightening her back before heading slowly towards the counter.  It isn't just that Penny has enough friends. It isn't just that Penny had a bad day. It isn't even just that Penny doesn't want to be bothered thus in the darkest table in the farthest corner; it is all of these things and simply looking at Alexander that moves Penny out of her happy place. Comes through in her voice, at least to that guy, but anyone looking could tell she's not in the mood. "That seat's taken. Take a hike, junior."  Isobel realizes that something is going on across the room but being too far away she just takes another sip of her drink and leans back, wistfully wishing she could kick up her feet and chill  Anupra eventually reaches the bar, sliding up onto a barstool and ordering a glass of cola from the barman. Anyone close enough could easily pick out the southern twang to her accent, her request delivered with a warm smile for the server.  Standingwater opens the padded door and enters the pub. Standingwater has arrived.  Standingwater moseys on in and heads for the bar. An Indian in cowboy gear walks into an Irish pub. Is this some kind of a joke?  Isobel blinks and then smiles as the gent wearing the battered hat steps in. Having just recently arrived from Europe this is something one would only read about, an indian in cowboy gear. Amusing.  And it's happening in Canada. Within the booth, Alexander does not move from the table. He lifts a finger as if to interupt you, then begins to fish around inside his pocket. Comming up with a cigarette package, he takes a good while to place one between his lips. Lighting it, he takes a drag and start to reverse the procedure to return the package to his pocket. A moment later, and he glances to you, "Was that to me?"  Anupra relaxes onto her barstool, setting her walking cane against the bar before reaching for her drink, taking a slow sip and peering around the room thoughtfully.  Tom opens the padded door and enters the pub. Tom has arrived.  Standingwater tilts his hat back as he takes a seat at the bar. "Beer. Nothing fancy."  The bar (#1) has 7 empty places.    Present:   Isobel   The pool table (#2) has 4 empty places.  The round table (#3) has 5 empty places.  The square table (#4) has 4 empty places.  The shadowy corner booth (#5) has 4 empty places.    Present:   Penny - Alexander   The counter by the pool table (#6) has 7 empty places.  The cigarette machine and pay phone (#7) has 3 empty places.  Downright frozen day for a walk around. Some are of the mind to not even go outside in weather like this - especially not at this late hour, when there's usually no excuse for it. But, then, given an excuse for it...some, like Tom, will sluggishly and torporously meander towards some destination in the frozen weather. Twelve minutes late on the twelfth day of the twelfth month in the year 2008, Tom pushes through the door and quickly pushes it closed behind him against the howling wind. Teeth still chattering, he stands inthe threshold of the door and pats snow off of his arms and shoulders.  Standingwater mumbles something incoherent when his beer finally arrives. For the longest time he just sits there and stares suspiciously at it. Weirdo.  Penny looks at her phone, briefly then to the interloper sitting across from her. "Yeah. And he's gonna want his seat back." Penny can play this game for only so long. She looks around for the waitress or the goon or whoever 'he' is like it's about to go down; everything is immanent. But she has no other props - her one and only cigarette gone out just a few moments before, she sets her hands under the table. Maybe into her lap. Maybe her pockets. Maybe the small off her back - yeah. Her shoulders do that hitching thing when people are reaching for something behind them. Something tucked away nice and small. "So you're leaving, right?"  Isobel slides a few bills out of her pocket and then swigs back the last of her beer.. sighing with pleasure once she sets the pint down on the bar  "Is there something wrong with it?" Anupra inquires casually in Standingwater's direction, head tilted a little. "Too fancy, maybe?" she adds, smiling a little.  Standingwater shakes his head without taking his eyes off the beer. "Just waiting for the mind control drug to seperate out from the beer so I can skim it off. Teh government won't rest until the public is reduced to mindless zombies. Combined with telemarketing and network television... Well, no need to go any futher into that."  Alexander looks up at the waitress having stopped by the table. He taps his chin, looking as if he concidered something or the other. Placing an order, he reaches his arms up and folds them behind his head, making himself comfortable, "Certainly." Although he doesn't seem to be in any real hurry. "Nice make-up. Very.. primal.. modern."  Isobel sighs and then slips from the bar and heads towards the door. Zipping her jacket shut and then taking care with the snaps as she departs Isobel pushes through the padded door and exits the pub. Isobel has left.  Eyeing the other amerindian thoughtfully, Anupra eventually shrugs. "Whatever you say....don't touch the stuff myself, so hopefully I'm safe." She gestures to her cola. "Though only god knows what's in this stuff."  Standingwater snags a spoon and starts dipping beer out of his glass into an ashtray. "Worse. Much worse. The alcohol in the beer neutralizes the biological agents the United Nations has been sneaking into our water supply over the years. Notice the dumbing down of the general population. Soon even shoe laces will be too complex. Folks will need these fancy robots to tie their shoes for them." Uh... huh.  You snooze, you lose, right? But somedays you win, and man, some days you do nothing but lose. And it's good for the soul, probably. Builds character, right? So, Tom seems content to snooze a little, lazily making sure his jacket is free of snow before he trudges a long, thin line of wet snow into the room. Brushing a hand over his close cropped hair in what looks like a compulsive gesture, Tom drifts deeper into the meandering evening crowds, through the jig-dancers and step-dancers and carefully around the couple on the dance floor, swimming through the vibrant music, dodging confrontations and potential fist-fights thanks to an eye for human nature. Blind to the greater mass of humanity, he seems to brighten some when he spots Penny - but that's ok, it balances out when he sees the young go-getter sitting with her. Symmetry is, thankfully, maintained by Mister Tall, Dark, and Handsome. Jaw set, he moves towards the shadowy booth in the corner, perhaps a bit wary.  Anupra mmhmms, chuckling quietly at Standingwater's response. "If you say so," she agrees pleasently. "Don't feel too stupid or dumb myself, but maybe I'm just deluded."  Standingwater eyes his beer one more time before finally taking a sip. "Ah. Then the signals broadcast by the Trilateral Commission's satellites aren't having an affect on you. Excellent."  "So can you taste any remaining mind-controlling drugs?" Anupra wonders curiously, brows arching a touch. She seems to be humoring the other barfly for now.  Standingwater shakes his head and sets the beer aside. "I think I got it all."  Anupra nods a bit and goes back to sipping her cola, expression thoughtful, perhaps a touch bemused.  Everything's a gamble - nothing ventured, they say. But let's face it; Penny's not in a betting mood even with the royal flush in her hand. Her hands are still under the table and she's taken a more relaxed posture in the booth; leaning just enough to catch that perfect moment. There is fortune and opportunity staring at her dead-on. She affects the kind of nonchalant grin you see in ads everywhere; ads geared toward the socially irresponsible drinkers of the world, carpe diem. Penny-with-the-off-table-eyecontact makes a target of Tom. "Tried to save you a seat but," her shoulders lifted marginally. This isn't her fault. This wasn't the way it was supposed to go down.  Standingwater goes back to his beer. Mmmmm... Beer.   Alexander motions towards where he is seated, then nods at Tom, "Looks like I should be going after all. Spicy girl you have there, bud." He stands from his seat, grinning at the fellow having approached the table. Snapping his fingers as if he had forgotten something, he turns back to Penny, "Right.. Your phonenumber?"  At the eye-contact as he approaches, Tom looks momentarily caught off guard - maybe just at his first look at her in a long time, maybe something else. Whatever it is, as he approaches, Alexander keeps him off-guard. "Hnh." Precarious, Tom's gaze skims from one to the other... then, finally, he settles his incomprehension on Alexander. "I don't exactly have her," he speaks, the tone a little distracted - drained of emotion one way or the other. "So, uh, feel free," he adds, in an ex post facto endorsement of him asking Penny for her number - the tone indicates sarcasm, however. Sort of like saying 'make yourself at home' to a burgler, really.  While the alarms are going off. Right.  Penny had started to sit up a little, one hand maybe tucking her shirt in as Alexander takes his leave but maybe now she doesn't. "Got a pen?" something terrible in her smile, in all the attention she's paying to Alexander just now "..it's a little long. I'm" and excuse, an easy segue "borrowing." Every widening, the spectre of insinuation hovers while people shuffle around the paused three-some. Penny can be accommodating when it suits her. She can wait, indicates that with a gesture, a simple leaning to one side.Standingwater finishes off his beer with little fanfare and turns to leave.  Anupra has disconnected.  Alexander opens his jacket to reach into the inside pocket of it. He comes up with a cellphone, flipping it open. Pushing a few buttons, he turns the display to Penny, "Why don't you type it down here, bruiser." A glance is directed Tom, and he asks solemnly, "Did you say something?"  Standingwater pushes through the padded door and exits the pub. Standingwater has left.  A moment of pause. It would seem there's been some kind of programming error in childhood - Tom is, for a heartbeat or two, quite obviously conflicted as to the appropriate response. Rival response to the stimuli just offered. Within the confines of his mouth, he touches his tongue to the roof, probably to check for adrenaline. Finally, scratching his scalp, Tom offers an easy going: "Nothing of note." A pause. "Uh, champ." He glances to Penny with some measure of disorientation... then adds, mildly, "You've got a funny sense of humor. Is this your idea of a joke?" No anger - only mild disorientation.  Devard has arrived.  Now it's just old. Game's over. She inclines her body foward on the booth's bench, cants her head toward the floor and then up a little. It's a revealing pose; decolletage twisted she is become an ingenue and Penny says "If I wasn't giving it up last time, what makes you think I was giving it now? Just move along with your little biker friends back to your little biker life and leave me alone, okay?" She leans back and leaves it for the men to hash out.  Devard read your description.  Alexander nods his head a couple of times, "True, true, we were awfully busy that night. Well.. You can always drop by my place again. Ride on my bike, roll around the hay." He tips a hat that doesn't exist, "Ma'am." Walking from the table, he heads towards the exit, inclined to leave it would seem.  Well, ok. Tom looks to be on steadier ground, now. Eyes flit from Penny's angry reply to Alexander's odd response. The whole thing is way too dramatic, too... over-the-top to really impinge too much on Tom' sense of personal reality. This is like TV. He can adjust to this - theatrics! An easy smile as he makes to occupy to space where Alexander once stood - then, thinking better of it, just shifts towards Penny, sits on the corner of the exit. As Alexander is walking away, Tom suggests, "We should probably get out of here. It's not exactly my uh..." Tom pauses, to look at a 50-something Irishman doing a jig  with a 17-somethinged girl with adorable freckles... to gaze at Alexander's departing back... at a drunken bartender leaning onto a counter. "My scene, I guess you'd say."  Did someoe say.. Theatrics? Devard wanders into the bar, absently juggling a pair of balls in one hand. Yes, Juggling. You got a problem with that? Using his other hand to open doors and the like, he then proceeds towards the bar, smiling confidently.  Penny shifts some. Little slice of absurdity does the soul good. But too much might make one just a little bit crazy. Penny watches what Tom watches and shrinks a little; some of the wind flagging out of that bravado, some queasiness creeping up on her - like she's just now seeing where she is for the first time. "I'm really sorry, springing that on you. It's just I think that guy's *stalking* me and I," she makes a helpless gesture; something only a woman can pull off with any degree of accurracy "he cornered me. Would you mind.." pausing, Penny takes the phone off the table and tucks it away somewhere "would you mind walking me to my car?"  Alexander pushes through the padded door and exits the pub. Alexander has left.  Hot-dog! Traumatized girls make great dates, you bet. So why isn't Tom exactly leaping for joy at this golden opportunity? Go figure, some guys get all the breaks and never appreciate it. Tom wearily rises to his feet, offering a sad little smile. "Uh, sure. Sure, I'll walk you out to your car." A pause. "You alright?" It should be noted that as/if/when Penny heads for the door, Tom follows. Even walks alongside. You stand and leave the shadowy corner booth.

      Jane pages: Hello? I'm just answering this phone....  "WHO THE FUCK IS THIS?"  If you held the phone away from your ear, the shout could be heard by lots of other people. Provided there are lots of other people around.  Jane pages: "Ow? This is me. Who is _this_?"  "GIVE THE PHONE TO STEVE."  It's clear the woman on the other end of the line doesn't deal with 'Me.'  Jane pages: I'm sorry. I don't know anyone called 'Steve'. And would you mind lowering your voice? Giving me a headache is really just going to get me pissed.  "GIVE THE PHONE TO ITS OWNER."  It's also clear that the woman on the other end of the line doesn't give a shit about you.  Jane pages: Sure.... let me just shove it back in his pocket, okay?  From afar, Jane says, as though to someone with her. ""Wouldn't know. All she wants to do is yell at me like she's fuckin' nuts."  The phone makes noises. Like someone pressing buttons repeatedly but in a pattern. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Jane pages: "Could do, but she's not talkin' to me." She pauses, "Jealous girlfriend?"  The button pressing continues. It's very repetative and very annoying.  Pobble pages: Yello? From afar, Pobble repeats louder, "Helloooo? "Steve."  It's Penny. She sounds *pissed.* Y'know - the subtle way all girls get. She nice. Toofuckingnice.  "Penny. God would like to express to you his extreme displeasure. He states that while he still loves you, he is currently very much not liking you."  Pobble adds almost as an afterthought. "I on the other hand, have forgiven you for being a copper and trying to kill me."  "God has a great ass. God can also eat me."  A pause.  "Who answered your phone? What if she'd pressed the star key? Don't give the stupid phone away. Hiro said. ... and that wasn't me. It was some guy. Where are you? I saw all the shit in the bathroom and got .." Penny would never say it outright but yeah, she worries.  "God currently has no ass, and is unable to do any eatings. I don't know who answered the phone. I diddn't want to move. I'm lying down on the grass. I realize you may be jealous, but since you're admitting to bringing a gentleman policeman home I don't feel so bad anymore. Something major has happened. Very very important."  There's a clinking sound. Background noises "Hang on," Penny moving through a crowd then it's quiet again.  "Okay. I can hear again and I didn't try to kill you. Let's just be clear on that. YOU overdid it again. And that fucking monkey was doing nothing to help you either."  Riled, she brings herself down a few pegs. "So what happened."  "The LSD contained a compound I'm developing, the copious quantities injested with a straw managed to form a cellular divinity matrix within me noggin. While you were trying to kill me, I must've started to mutter something close to a prayer. Either way. God has entered me. Quite literally. He's trapped in my head. For reals."  There's a very long silence.  "You know there's no such thing. ..which god is it?"  and  "You're so fulla shit."  and  "I wasn't trying to kill you. You Were Hemmoraging."  Pobble sounds entirely serious. "Yahwe. Jehova. Le lord ala hosts. He's rather miffed to say the least. He blames you. I blamed you too, but like I said. Your forgiven. You'd expect him to forgive too but he's a cunt really. I think he's regressed to his OT days. I've seen behind the facade. I'm not bugfucked, it's truth. Scouts honour."  "Pobs," and suddenly it's Intervention Time Penny, complete with this-side-of-warning creeping into her voice "I want you to listen to me. Very Fucking Carefully. Whatever you dropped last night might've left you cracked open, I'll give you that, but no god anybody writes about would think your head's a great place to set up shop. Okay? Pobble?" From afar, Pobble sighs, "It wasn't out of choice. Cellular Divinity Matrix. Got it all figured me. See, this skeptisism in your tone isn't going down too well. God is getting angry, which is giving me a headache. I'm going to go now, I shall be home shortly and maybe you'll be more rational by then. Goodbye." and he hangs up. Ring ring  *click* "Keene here."  "Hi." Flat and cranky; sounds like a busy kitchen behind the voice "Pobble thinks he's god."  Keene sounds moderately bored. "Again? I thought he really liked thinking he was a fish."  "It's his fault the bathroom's a mess." There's a big pause, more noise. Sounds like she's in the back of a bar. "I meant to tell you about it this morning but I wasn't up and then we missed eachother. Anyway. That's drugs in the sink and he was on the floor when I got home and Dave was being useless under the bed, said he was dying. So."  The phone is muffled for a minute, a waitress in the background taking Penny's order. Bourbon. One of those nights.  "So he's gone when I get up and I went looking then some cunt answers his phone and he tells me god's living in his head."  His voice is carefully neutral. "Good for him. Maybe the Quiet will do him some good. That, and me cleaning the bathroom out before somebody brushed their teeth with LSD."  "Y'think? I guess," uneasy, overtly uncomfortable with anyone being that unavailable "He has to sign the lease papers. Thing's in his name." Distracted. Waitress with drinks. "Hey how'd that meeting go?"  "It was miserable, as I expected. I left a summary of my notes on the desk. I predict they get crushed sometime in the next six months. Our objective is to be out of range when it happens."  "Could do with some target practice," taking on Pobble's thick accent she does a good impersonation "What about that Aaron guy. Heard he's a knob. Bet on him switchin'it up again?"  A grunt. "I'm willing to bet he never switched in the first place. These people are /easily/ fooled."  Glasses clinking, she snorts and snifs "Yo, they're a mess. 'Cept for a few. Never met'im but his missives are funny as fuck. I miss yours; when're you gonna write for us again... 'member those leaftlets at the Mall of America? At the BestBuy? Those were *the best*" pausing "or maybe it's a waste. Hyperion's cornered the market on that kinda propaganda. Oh um.." leading into someone, she trails off.  "I'm going to wait to see how Hyperion handles the latest batch of stupidity that happens before I act."  Quietly she adds "There's some other stuff in the bathroom."  "I've heard. I ain't touching it."  "Good. I'll be drinking if you need me."

      >> Saturday afternoon, May 3 2003.  Keene goes to a Tradition council meeting, since he's one of the few people sober enough to do it.  Hilarity ensues.  Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber          This room is mostly empty, even more vast in some ways than the hall outside. Only three things mar its granite perfection; an immense marble table at the head of the room with nine chairs, each marked with a single Sphere glyph, an intricately inscribed Certamen circle in the center of the room, and perhaps forty seats at the back of the room, for observers and audience. A single door to the left glows a soft gold.          The great marble table seems designed with the center chair in mind. Polished and pristine, the table stands as if it had stood here for an eternity, its circle unbroken save the path which leads from between the Seat of Entropy and the Seat of Prime to the new Seat, it's unknown symbol shining a warm golden hue.                            >                           Contents: Cally Marcus Alex Kaze Taliesin Rhiamon Paksenarrion Aaron Jonah Obvious exits: Left Door    Out      Kaze nods in turn and rises, "I am Shinketsu Kaze bani Akashic Brotherhood, leader of the Dharma's Tear Cabal." he says and takes his seat once more.  Jonah says, to Keene, "Just in time, Mr. Keene. Please, take a seat in the Audience."  Keene steps in from the realm. He politely inclines his head to Jonah as he passes through the doors, then moves to an inconspicuous seat near the back of the audience section.  Cally looks over to see who's in the Spirit seat..  Leaning back on the rear legs of his chair, his feet on the back of the chair in front of him, Alex could be asleep for all anyone could know. But then again, this is the same attention that he has given all of the meetings so far and rarely seems to miss anything.  Cally looks out and around the table.. "I'm Cally Grant Bani Electrodyne Diva, head of Team Ether.  Marcus holds up his hand, "Andrew Marcus Yarr, Cult of Ecstacy, sole member of Razor's Edge."  Jonah is studiously taking notes as each name is called out. His pen returns to the inkwell multiple times, indicating that his script is large and ornate; some would say inefficient. He looks up to the Audience, awaiting their call.  Rhiamon says, "Rhiamon Jones House Ex Miscellanea of the Orer of Hermes.Member of the Turris Scientiae"  Keene, after putting his legal pad down on a chair next to him, gets up and makes his usual presentation. "I am Steven Keene of House Ex Miscellanea, of the Order of Hermes. I am the head of the Invisible College." After that, he sits back down, picks up his legal pad, and starts taking notes.  Paksenarrion coughs and speaks up, "Paksenarrion Johanson, I am of the Celestial Chorus.. Independent."  "Alex Hess, of the Virtual Adept," Alex calls out casually,"Member of After-Math."  Jonah finishes writing down the names, then lowers his pen. A glance is cast upon each individual, then to the group as a whole. "Very well. We shall begins this meeting. The first item on the agenda is the formation of a central government for the new Chantry."  Cally nods listening..  Keene takes meticulous notes.  Jonah continues, "The new Chantry shall be divided into two separate governmental bodies. Each shall act as a check and balance to the other. The bodies shall be as follows: The Primary Governing Council shall consist of a voted member from each Cabal, plus one member voted in by the independents. Each representative shall have an equal vote, save for one. Every representative will serve as Moderator for a term of one month or four meetings, which ever one comes first. The Moderator will then pass off to the next representative according to a schedule which shall be drawn up at a later time. The Moderator will serve as a tie-breaker, in that his vote shall carry the weight of two for purposes of determining the result of a tie only."  Kaze listens attentively with his hands folded before him demonstrating that oh so typical detached Akashic serenity.  Alex ... doesn't do much of anything. Reacting to the purpose (or dictated) governmental organization in neither word or action.  Jonah says, "The Governmental Council's primary duties will be to draw up, enact, and sustain a Council Charter. They will be responsible for determining and declaring the laws of the Council and seeing that they stay fair and coherant."  Cally raises a hand requesting to be recognized..  Jonah glances down at his notes momentarily, before continuing again. "The Security Council shall consist of a Council of Nine. Each Tradition in the city shall have a representative present, and it may not be the same representative as from the Governmental Council, save in very exceptional cases. It, too, will possess a Moderator with the same powers as in the Governmental Council, with its own unique schedule." He notes Cally's hand, but does not call on her yet. Instead, he finishes his statement. "The Security Council shall be exactly what it sounds like: It's responsibility will be the security and maintenance of both the Chantry and the Realm, as well as the enforcement of the Governmental Council's laws. They shall be tasked to develop a security policy pursuant to the laws generated by the Governmental Council." Now, he guestures to Cally. "Yes, Miss Grant?"  Cally looks to Jonah. "It sounds as if you're suggesting the primary governing council will act as the Legislative and Executive branch of our Government, with the Security council acting Judiciary? similar to the US Government?  Jonah chuckles quietly, "I was attempting to avoid comparison to other governments, Miss Grant. But yes, I suppose that comparison could apply."  Cally ahs and jots that down.. "thank you.  Jonah looks back to his notes, nods, and picks up. "Each Council, as I said, shall act as a check and balance for the other. Policies are not required to pass both Concils to be effectual; however, with a signifigant majority vote in the opposite Council, a policy may be vetoed. A signifigant majority is equal to two-thirds its total members. This applies only to policies which are reviewed within thirty days of their ratification, and not to existing policies. Existing policies may be appealed at any time, pending review and signifigant majority vote by both Councils."  Hana has arrived.  Alex raises his hand.  Jonah looks over to Alex, "Go ahead, Mr. Hess."  Hana comes through the door, immediately moving to a place from which she can view the proceedings.  Jonah passes a nod to Hana, then seems to note down her presence in the log. Lowering his hand, Alex doesn't bother to rise. "From your description, it sounds like all the members of either council will have to be present to be able to actually get anything done...."  Keene continues to take detailed notes on the proceedings onto his legal pad.  Jonah shakes his head, "No. It will be possible to hold a meeting, but only if that signifigant majority is met. As long as at least two-thirds of the members are present, meetings shall be held. In cases of less than two-thirds yet not less than half, a Council Moderator may hold a meeting and cast a vote, then subsequently send missing Council members a declaration of the vote, explaining the topic and allowing them to cast their vote directly to the Moderator and one other, with the results declared at the next meeting."  No reaction is given to the response to his question. It might even be believed that Alex didn't actually have any interest himself, just thinking that it was something that should be cleared up.  Jonah takes a few fleeting notes, only to look up again. "This issue shall be more formally declared and posted for all to see. Voting for Cabal and the Independent Representatives of the Governmental Council and for the members of the Security Council, where it is appropriate, shall commence soon. Any more questions or comments?"  Taliesin has arrived. Jesyca has arrived.  Jonah begins shuffling through his papers, "If there are none, then I shall continue with the meeting. The next topic on the agenda is the movement of the entryway to this Realm, as well as the potential for the relocation of the Node."  Jesyca tries to slip into the meeting without being noticed, but she's panting a bit from her quick dash across the realm to be here. She begins to walk quietly over to her usual spot, and kneels down there.  A faint smile comes to Alex's face at the mention of moving the node.  Jonah glances over to Jesyca as she enters. He grants her a nod, confirming her presence, then seems to record it in his log.  Keene is sitting in the back of the audience section, taking detailed notes on the proceedings on a legal pad.  Paksenarrion leans against the wall to the side, nodding a greeting to Jesyca as she enters.  Jonah settles his papers before him. "The portal to this Realm is not static. However, it does seem to be somewhat tied to the Shallowing created by the Node below Allan Gardens. The portal should be able to be moved, if we can either tie it to a new Shallowing or if we could possibly relocate the Node. Doing so is very, very difficult and would require more power than any one of us may possess. However, I do believe that, with the aid of the Traditions Council, we might be able to handle this task."  Jesyca flinches a bit when she notices Keene and lowers her head quietly.  Keene shows no particular reaction to Jesyca. He has no doubt noticed her arrival, but appears to be more focused on taking notes at the moment.  Paksenarrion tilts her head and glances at Jesyca curiously..  Alex remains seated in his chair. Leaning back on the rear legs of the chair, with his feet propped up on the back of the chair in front of him. His shade-covered eyes seem to be focused on his feet, but who knows what he is really looking at.  Rhiamon sits quietly listening.  Chase has arrived.  Hana leans bordely against a wall; looking bored only through her appearance of inattention.  Jonah says, "However, such a thing as relocating a Node will require much work and much time. It may even have a noticeable effect to the world around it. As such, it may not be a valid idea. A study should be performed to measure the impact of relocating the Node. We may, instead, need to see about opening a new one, or strengthing one that I believe already exists on the new Chantry grounds."  "How about we steal the one at the vacant lot,"Alex suggests with a small shrug.  Jonah frowns, "Again, relocating a Node may have drastic effects on the environment around it. Hence why I suggest a study."  "What kind of studies?..." Alex asks.  Hiro enters the Council Chambers from the Main Hall outside. Hiro has arrived.  Jonah's frown becomes sharper. "Perhaps you should allow me to speak, Mr. Hess. You are talking out of turn. If you wish to speak, you know the procedure." He sighs, then clears his throat. "Clearly, Mr. Hess, you are not aware of the scientific method. Use it to determine the environmental effects of relocating a Node."  Keene is seated near the rear of the audience section, writing detailed notes on a legal pad. He's gone through a few pages by now.  At some point, Hiro is there shadowing the doorway: record bag over a shoulder -- bulging, no doubt, with assorted and sundry substances which are in no way records -- and hands balled up in his labcoat's pockets. A cigarette hangs from the corner of his mouth, trailing greyish smoke.  Jonah takes notes of the new arrivals as they enter. He grants them a nod to confirm that he has noted them, then goes back to the meeting at hand. "I will need people who are knowledgeable in the material Spheres, as well as the Sphere of Prime, to work together on this study. We will need viable evidence supporting the lack of environmental damage before we relocate a Node of any size."  Paksenarrion raises her hand  Alyx slips in quietly behind those who've also come a bit late, walking silently across to the Seat of Entropy and settling into it. Gloved hands settle on the tabletop and she listens to the speakers, trying to get a feel for what's being said.  Jesyca lifts up her hand slowly, and partially as words sink in and find their way of being processed in her mind. She is in her usual kneeling position.  Jonah guestures first to Pakzenarrion. "Yes, Miss Johanson?"  Paksenarrion coughs and stands up from leaning against the wall, speaking clearly, "I am well and equally versed in those spheres.." Pointing to the Spirit Chair she continues "As well as that sphere. I would be the first to offer my help with that."  Jonah nods to Paksenarrion, noting this down in his book. He glances about. "Anyone else?"  Raising her hand slightly, Alyx sits back and waits for her turn.  Cally raises her hand as well.  Keene continues to take dutiful notes on the proceedings.  Sighting Keene and Penny at the rear of the council chamber, Hiro slides down into a folding chair nearby; settling his record bag across his lap.  Jonah looks to Alyx, smiling. "Miss Davian."  Alex drops his feet to the floor and stands. Gather his sling bag and helmet from the chair next to him, he turns and heads for the door.  "If, in 'material spheres' you mean the three pattern spheres, I offer my small skill in Forces." Alyx volunteers. "Though my understanding of Prime is somewhat limited."  Alex has left.  Jonah nods to Alyx, also noting it down in his books. "Very well. Miss Grant."  Cally answers "I'm not as well ranked as Paksen is but I'm willing to help as well. Which leads a question. How will we be able to work together on this when our Methods differ?  Jonah nods, "That is a valid question. We will not be doing this in a ritual style, for it is more observation and study. In fact, magickal arts themselves may rarely come into play. This will be a /study,/ not an /application./"  Kaze raises a hand slightly.  Jonah says, "Yes, Shinketsu-san."  Kaze folds his hands before him once more, "I would offer my experience with the spheres known generally as Forces and Prime, as well as my Kohai's skills with Matter for this endeavor."  Jonah notes this down. "Very well. Are there any others?"  Keene continues taking notes peaceably.  Cally jots down notes on her end as well  Jonah nods. "If there are no others, then I would like to make one quick annoucement before I wrap up." He stands, organizing his notes. "Shinketsu Kaze-san and Dharma's Tear is bringing in a new member, an acolyte by the name of Hojo Ryoshi. Also, Mr. Aaron Michaels is bringing in an acolyte of his own, by the name of Catherine McGee. I have spoken to both and determined them acceptable for entrance to the Realm. Please give them the respect you would give to any other of our own." He looks about to everyone else. "Is there anything else that anyone wishes to enter into the meeting?"  Cally raises her hand.  Jonah says, "Yes, Miss Grant."  Cally stands up.. "I wish to enter in the meeting about my plan to jam the Hyperion commercials and upload several of ours in their stead..  Marcus frowns a bit, looking over to Cally. First time he's been active this entire meeting, it seems. He doesn't say anything, though, just listens.  Jonah nods and returns to his seat, pulling a fresh piece of paper from his briefcase. "Very well. Please, discuss your plan before those present."  Keene glances to Cally when she speaks again, then starts a new page to write on.  Cally nods and looks out.. "My esteemed Colleagues. I have discussed this plan with those in my Cabal, and a couple of others as well. As many of you know, the Technocracy has the upper hand because of how they can sway the populace. The Hyperion Commercials are ample proof of that. If we can do something to disrupt their message and add mistrust in their public image, I feel we may have a foot in the door to make our part of the Ascension War that much stronger. A suggestion of mine was to take the families shown in the previous two commercials and show them being forced out of their homes because Hyperion desired their locations for businesses. another clip would be of the Homeless shelter located quite near the vacant land also being bulldozed with a sign saying, coming soon Hyperion's new Executive Parking Lot. We can wrap up our commercial showing the families now mixed with the homeless freezing in alley's under buildings suggesting Hyperion has taken over the city. Now my idea can be improved on but that was the example I was hoping to Engineer. " she stops takes a sip of water then continues "However, I wonder now if the idea may be a little late. I've spoken to Aaron who pointed out I should speak to the Chantry on a whole to get their opinion, and to Abel, as any affront to Hyperion may cause them to pressure him. Abel did give his blessing, but a couple of my colleagues did not feel it appropriate. I now open this discussion if I may."  Jonah nods, "Very well. Consider this a forum. Does anyone have an opinion they would like to share on this matter?"  Paksenarrion shakes her head, quietly continuing to listen  Jesyca speaks very softly, and out of turn, "I like it." She then goes back to being a mute on the floor.  Marcus raises his hand, but doesn't wait to be called on, "As long as you don't want to put a park on that lot, I'm fine with it."  "If there are no other opinions to be voiced," Jonah says, noticing the silence on the matter, "I shall speak." His eyes fall upon Cally. "From what I understand of your plan, you wished to 'hijack' the Hyperion commercials and show your own version in their place. I believe that this would serve only to bring the wrath of the Technocracy down upon you and upon others. I believe it would be more fruitful for you to create your commercials as you see fit and then simply air them alongside the rest. This may cost some sum of money, however it is more efficient for you to show your objections to their project in a non-threatening manner. Allow their commercials to air, but air your own. Then you can let the masses decide."  Jonah lays his pen down, leaning forward against the table. "We are not terrorists, after all. Aggressive actions beget aggressive responses. And, also, you should be sure you know everything you can about your enemy before you strike; you should research Hyperion and know what it constitutes before you begin making claims against them that you cannot back up when your claims are presented against you."  Jonah says, "Are there any other comments on Miss Grants interests?"  Cally nods.. "I will discuss this with my Cabal, but I do ask this. Should my cabal and I decide to continue with our plan of hijacking the signal, Would there be repercussions from the Traditions? " she holds up a hand. "I am neither stating nor backing down, as I want my Cabal to have a discussion in this. I merely wish to know what sort of repercussions if any we may expect from our Allies."  Jonah responds, softly, "There will be no repercussions from the Council that I can guarantee, however I cannot guarantee that you will be awarded any support from it, either."  Hana pushes off the wall and slips out the door. Hana steps back out to the main hall. Hana has left.  Cally nods to that.. "I will promise this then. If my Cabal decides to do it, I will of course inform everyone, on the board days before we strike. this way if anyone wishes to help they can, and those who wish not to do it can prepare for any repercussions.. Cally is meaning Techno repercussions  Jonah says, "If there is nothing more on this subject, I will ask once more if there are any other subjects which anyone would like to bring to the meeting."  Alyx raises her hand after a moment's thought.  Jonah seems to wish to add something, looking back to Cally. "Miss Grant, just keep in mind that the Technocracy will likely respond to the Traditions as a whole, and not just to those responsible. Therefore, any harm that comes on anyone outside of your Cabal, should you choose to perform your actions in such a way that causes a response, will fall on your shoulders." He glances to Alyx. "Miss Davian."  "Since she's not here at the moment to make the point herself, I wish to offer up something on behalf of Aaron's student, Catherine," Alyx murmurs. "Though it shoulden't be a problem, I'd like to make it known that she is mute, conversing by means of either sign-language or the written word. Just a heads-up, to help everyone avoid embaressing either themselves or her by commenting on her quietness."  Jonah smiles, "Yes, Miss Davian is correct. Miss McGee is indeed mute. Therefore, keep that in mind if you speak with her. She is not allowed to be out of Mr. Michael's presence when in the Realm, though, so this should not be a problem." He passes his glance about. "Any other comments, questions, or agendas?"  Alyx sits back, glancing around at those here.  Cally shakes her head.. "Just one.. I also sent you a letter a while back about the possibility of setting up a school, where we can exchange skills and training as well as culture so we can learn more of each other.,.  Jonah responds to this, briefly, "As we all know, cross-training between Traditions has always been a sore-spot. It has been attempted on many occasions; unfortunately, for the most part, our ideas of magick are not compatible and thus restrict us from teaching each other the Arts. A school would be an interesting task, but for the purpose of learning about different cultures and perhaps beginning the process of tearing down the walls between ideas, but such is a task which would require many, many years to complete to its maximum effect, I fear."  Cally nods.. "I was thinking more along the lines of weapons training, and unarmed combat myself.. As well as information about the Traditions. Cally says, "err individual Traditions.."  Lifting her hand again, Alyx glances thoughtfully between Cally and Jonah. In response to Cally's comment, Jonah again says, "We are not terrorists. We should not have to fight with weapons combat, and instead with our wits and intelligence." Then, he guestures to Alyx, "Yes, Miss Davian."  "While we're on the subject of teaching and learning, I'm looking for a mentor who's capable of teaching someone of my paradigm. My knowledge of other Traditions is sketchy at best, so I woulden't know who to approach," Alyx voices, looking around again in a semi-hopeful manner. "Teaching in any Sphere I can learn would be appreciated."  Marcus looks across to Alyx, then furrows his brow. "You a Euthie? Talk to me after the meeting..."  Jonah stands again, stacking his papers before him. He looks over the collected group, then smiles. "I fear that this meeting has gone over its time. Therefore, we shall now adjourn the meeting. A formalized writeup of the Councils shall be presented within the week, and information regarding the Node Relocation Study shall also be posted, with a signup so that people who are interested in helping may help. The next meeting shall also be posted on the board, and shall fall soon, so keep your eyes out for it. Please, if there are any more questions or comments, do not hesitate to contact me after the meeting for clarification."  Cally nods to that and gathers up her papers  Alyx rises slowly from her seat, adjusting her gloves before heading over towards Marcus.  Jesyca stirs a bit from her position on the floor. Her head slowly rises, and a yawn comes out of her mouth.  >> Keene's brain shuts off for a while, then switches back on.  Marcus stays sprawled in the Seat of Time, relaxed. He smiles to Alyx as she approaches him, but doesn't move.  Hiro starts awake in his seat, rubbing at the side of his face.  Keene concludes his note-taking when the meeting ends, putting the pad away inside of his jacket.  Cally nods and stands walking to Jonah.. "why don't you come over for Dinner some time? I'd like to talk with you on a few things."  Jonah chuckles as he puts his things away. "I am unfortunately a very busy old man. I will try, but I cannot guarantee anything."  Alyx comes to stand behind the Seat of Time, arms clasped around the top of the backrest. "So," she addresses with a slight smile to the seat's occupants.  Hiro wakes up in stages, which seems to involve scratching his head and working his way down. By the time he's given the old wang chung a good long delousing, he totters to his feet. "It's friday," he informs Keene. Never mind it's nine in the morning. "Let's go get some jim beam."  Marcus looks up to Alyx, then chuckles. "So. Yeah, I've had some luck teaching Euthies here and there. It all depends on their style. At some points, we tap into the same mystical beliefs, so there is some leeway." He kicks up, out of the chair, and onto his feet. "Let's take a walk, see if I can't help you."  Jesyca looks over towards Hiro, and then Keene. She speaks softly, "Hopefully, this time you will not end up causing a disturbance at Overdrives Alley."  Cally nods and grins.. "just give me a call then.. " Cally stands and leaves The Council Table. Cally makes her way out..  Marcus stands and leaves The Council Table.  Hiro fixes Jesyca with an infinitely placid look. The kind of expression a hindu cow might posess. "Excuse me?" he inquires, with improbably good diction. He adjusts the strap of his record bag, unzipping the pouch. "What was that?" Yes; Hindu Cow. Perhaps a hint of pleasant expectance, as if he were trying to catch barely-missed words from a close friend and personal confidant.  Jesyca lifts up her shoulders a bit towards Hiro, and lets out a breath, "It is not one of the best places. A lot has happened there, and several members of the technocracy have come in there, and made it their personal hangout."  Alyx nods and follows Marcus, arms crossed comfortably over her chest as she slips out.  Marcus steps back out to the main hall. Marcus has left. Alyx steps back out to the main hall. Alyx has left.  "And we wouldn't want to compromise your valuable ass-shaking job," drones Hiro, this time through teeth which are more gritted than fixed in a grin. That smile widened. It didn't work very well. "You ever try some cuntish bullshit like that 'gain, we c'n have our next bit'f dialogue in the certamen circle, you catch my drift."  Jonah looks up, between Hiro and Jesyca. "Enough. Hiro, your language is out of line." He looks to Keene. "Mr. Keene, I have heard some nasty rumors about the activities of the College. I suggest you keep your cabal under control."  Keene has sat there quietly and let Hiro talk for a while, not seeming perturbed by Jesyca at all. Keene, after all, is the consummate professional. At Hiro's last comment, though, he puts up his hand to signify silence from Hiro, then gets up when Jonah speaks to him. Jesyca, for now, doesn't require his direct ministrations. "Would you care to share what you have heard, Magister? I, as a rule, dislike rumors."  Jesyca lets out a breath slowly, and looks towards Hiro, "Yeah, the pity, the shame, the idea of there being consequences for actions. The ideas, and attitudes I have watched over the months be presented here, has made begin to question if I really am the right side of the fence. Walk in, cause harm, walk back out, and expect to never get any consequences of those actions."  Hiro goes abrubtly and pointedly silent, neither meeting Jonah's gaze nor fixing it upon Jesyca. His attention, instead, drifts off into an idle middle distance; he retracts his hand from his bag, zipping it quietly shut.  Jonah sighs softly, then shakes his head. "Mr. Keene, perhaps at another time. I would much rather not risk exposing someone who came to me in strict confidence."  "I see," says Keene. "I can entirely understand your reticence to speak publically about a private matter, Magister. Would you prefer it if I made an appointment, at your convenience, to discuss the matter?" He appears sincere in this; perhaps Keene is just a victim of circumstance.  A sharp sniff, and Hiro ambles off towards the exit.  Jonah thinks, momentarily. He nods. "That may be appropriate. Please contact me on Monday, and we shall attempt to schedule an appointment."  Keene inclines his head respectfully. "As you wish it, Magister. Thank you for the opportunity."  Hiro steps back out to the main hall. Hiro has left.  >> Jescya:           Before you is a young girl or woman. She is a delicate five foot four, with a small frame to her body. Her skin is of a pale pallor, needs to be in the sun more often, but it is no different than the average typical neo-goth look. Her eyes are an emerald green, but show a touch of something, and they contrast with her raven black hair. Her hair is long enough to flow past her shoulders and turns up at the ends into a bit of a curl. Her face is a bit angular with a small nose, and delicate mouth with small pouty lips. Jesyca has a slender neck that meets her shoulders in a smooth flow. Her arms are slender as well, and her body is not over or under developed, but seems proportional, making her look pretty, but not beautiful and far from exotic.         She wears her long hair with most it pulled back from her face into a full ponytail. Along side her face are three distinct long ringlets of dark hair. Her face has a bit of make-up on it, a light red color painted upon her lips, and a dash of glitter upon her cheeks. Around her eyes she has on some black eyeliner. Clasped around her throat is a black velvet choker with a single black rose in its center. On a single petal is drop of painted blood.         Over her body is a long, once thick black cloak with a hood. The cloak flows over her body to the ground, dangling just a bit off of the ground exposing a bit of the shoes she wears and dingy gray socks. The cloak catches on the slight curves of her body but hardly enough to bring them to more attention.  Keene, having attended to that particular matter, then turns his attention to Jescya. "Hello," he directs to her. "I believe we have met before?" He puts out his hand to shake, perhaps in a peace-making gesture.  Jesyca gives a bow of her head towards Keene, and looks towards his hand. It takes her a moment but she does take his hand, "Yes, we have."  Jonah gathers his briefcase and his cane. "Good day, everyone."  Keene gives Jesyca a polite but firm handshake, then returns his hand to a neutral position at his side. "Good day, Magister," Keene directs to Jonah as he leaves. After a respectable amount of time, he returns his attention to Jesyca.  "I apologize for the scene that Dr. Alder and Mr. Stice caused at your bar," Keene says. "They were punished for their actions and have been put on notice to behave more responsibly in public. Whatever they did, it was stupid, and not becoming of men of their skill and knowledge." A short pause. "No one was hurt, I hope?"  Jesyca lifts up her shoulders a bit, "Not physically, though Cassidy seems to have decided to continue to stay away from things. I am not sure if that has to do with the various events, or what took place. It is over with, and in the past."  "Of course," says Keene, smiling professionally. "But I felt it was only proper that a suitable apology was given, in a more suitable forum than the front steps of the bar." He adjusts his lapels. "However, if I may offer you a free consultation? In most situations, police officers will treat someone wearing a suit automatically more credible than someone wearing, say, a Winger t-shirt. It is also common to the psychology of individuals who become police officers to be hostile to individuals who question their authority directly." He gestures with his left hand. "Thus, I found it extremely easy to influence the situation in my favor. I, however, meant you no harm; Technocrats in similar situations may have used the power differential created to much more harmful effect."  Jesyca shakes her head a bit, and lets it tilt off to the side slightly, "Last I saw, the real police didn't show up when one of them fried a kid standing right next to me. Guys in black suits walked in, grabbed the body, and walked out. The other man stood up and slipped away. Events like that, and others have made more than edgy when people start causing serious commotions in there. It is not my job that I am wishing to protect, is the owner."  Keene seems legitimately puzzled at that. "And no suspicion of any kind was raised from that incident at all?"  Jesyca shrugs her shoulders a bit, "Technocrats covering up for technocrats. I think those that arrived on the scene deemed it that he took too hard of a hit from the fight he was in. Which might have been believable if you could ignore the smell of cooked human meat, and the way the body reacted."  Jonah steps back out to the main hall. Jonah has left.  "That's amazing," says Keene. "I had no idea the Technocracy was this strong in Toronto."  Jesyca chews on her bottom lip a moment, "I do not know how strong they are, just that a lot of things have happened, and that they seem to be just about everywhere. Before I awakened, I knew several of them. I still do, I'm just trying to hide that I have awakened now."  Keene considers this for a moment or two before answering. "I operate under the assumption that the Technocracy learns everything soon enough, but I happen to be below their interest."  Jesyca gives a slight nod of her head, "I do not know where I lie on their interests, and I never have the intention of finding out."  "A rational goal," Keene says. "You may find it in your best interest to invest in some camoflage, then."  Jesyca cracks a slight smile, "And that is impossible, for me. I'm already out there too much, and speaking of already being out there too much. I have an art showing I am late for."  Keene's expression brightens. "Of course. Have a good evening."  Jesyca gives a bow of her head and begins to head off quickly out of the chambers.  >> Keene departs.

      Vulture leaves an apartment. Vulture has arrived. Vulture read your description.  //.etro: It is 05:06 am, early morning, on Monday the 08. day of December, 2008.  After having navigated the maze that is the Holiday Inn, the birdman has ended up in the lobby. He turns around a couple of times, just to make sure he's in the right place, and then heads slowly towards the counter. Vulture digs the keys out of his pocket as he goes - definitely through with nights in this place. Too expensive... someone should tell him it isn't a lodging house, but a hotel. Of course the prices are going to be higher.  Only the fitness freaks and partykids are up at this hour. Figure Penny fits into the latter group, trudging through the lobby toward the hallway. Her coat slung over one shoulder on two fingers, she's smoking something filtered. The greasy twenty-something behind the desk gives her a look, unwelcome but he can't do anything about a paying guest. Penny yawns in a big way, arms stretched out and everything, ashes where a vaccuum's just been run and trolls toward the continental breakfast alcove.  Having had a rather restless night's sleep, or day's sleep, or whatever, when Vulture arrives at the counter he's not exactly in a pleasent mood. Across the counter with one hand he grabs said desk clerk by the tie and hauls him over the divide between them... partway. He holds the key up in front of the young man's eyes, "Look here," Comes the lazy sound of the punk's voice, as he glances at the name time, "Richard... Dick... I fuck'n paid good money f'this fuck'n room, an all I can fuck'n hear's th'fuck'n people on either side o' me fuck'n an screamin'." Without ceremony he shoves the key into the breast pocket of the attendents shirt and shoves him back, pointing a finger just afterwards, "Y'keep th'fuck'n money... buy y'self a real hotel... Dick."  Cornering the cigarette on the left side of her mouth, she peruses the buffet with twitchy, disjointed movements. A couple in running gear cough politely to indicate to Penny that her smoke is bothering them. In lieu of a verbal answer, she drags and keeps puffing and grabs the basket of coffee stirrers&creamers, tucks it under her arm and piles up boxes of mini-cereals - the kind all kids like - and some other things; croissants, styrofoam cups, spoons and the metal pitcher of milk. The same couple clear their throats to indicate they, too, have some right to the milk Penny's absconding with and would like some conisderation.  But nobody's paying attention to them. The commotion at the front desk is more entertaining to the help than her. The old security guard is even thinking about getting off his ass. It's his job of course. "Dicky, y'okay Dicky?"  The kids squeaks "Fine, fine. Just," shaking a little "punching in a credit is all." Richard, like his nametag says, may be bitter and might not like Penny much but he's accommodating. "Sir, I've cancelled out all ch-ch-charges."  And in the meantime... Penny's looped the juice pitcher up in her other hand while no one's looking. Casually she starts walking toward the main hallway again.  In accordance with Intimidation law Fourty two point four, section three alpha, the punk at the counter turns to have a look at the security guard. He slides his shades down on his nose so that his eyes slip up overtop of them... living and dead. Its just a stare, nothing more, but it does allow him to  catch sight of the klepto and her stash of breakfast goods. For a moment, Vulture's attention is brought back around to the front desk attendent like a pair of Naval battle cannons, "Are y'try'n t'start shit, Dicky?" The voice goes quiet, and chill, "Y'try'n t'say that I can't fuck'n afford t'stay here? Did I fuck'n ask f'my goddamn money back, or f'charges t'be dropped?" He points back to the now, mostly empty, Continental breakfast trolley, "I woulda liked some fuck'n breakfast... but 'pparently y'don' keep th'goddamn thing stocked up like't should be... do you?"  The cart and table's a shambles; it's former glory now stockpiled in Penny's sticky fingers; but this is the right of all guests at the Holiday Inn - she can't help it if the attendants are slow; and they are (this being Canada) but they do catch on quickly and move far and away into the nether region of the pantry for to restock. The guard goes back to being docile and Richard remains his pleasant self behind the counter. Newly arriving guests can't tell he's cowering but we know better, don't we.  Penny's wise to the mohawk's complaint, though and while everyone else is extremely reluctant to approach the guy, she chucks him a few boxes with Tony le Tigre on them "Oi, heads" teething her smoke, she calls out from the corner of her mouth. Little on the mumbled side. Not the nimblest guy in the world, the punk turns to catch one box with his chest and the other with a hand. Hey, one out of two ain't bad. As he stoops to pick the other one up he lets a slashing grin cut across his lips, "Y'gonna throw th'milk now?" Standing up, he shoots Richard another Neck-breaking glance and then steps away from the desk to let the other check ins stride up to the counter. Box to his lips he tears the top off with all too perfect teeth - Tony the Tiger is about to end up chewed on and spat out. He has this way of eyeballing anyone who gets a little too close. Canadian, eh? Gotta have that good personal space. "R'should I wait f'th'slow motherfuckers here t'brin' somethin' that ain't lukewarm an pissed in?"  Penny has this kind of relieved expression about the eyebrows, unwrinkling slowly into a smirk. Like she's glad that glance is headed in the direction of the counter and not her. Like everything, it seems, would be alright for what's left of the morning.  Right then. Readjusting her grip on things, Penny uh-uhs and explains "Think you scared'em, guy. Wouldn't bet on them showing up again til you're gone or," pausing, she tugs out the burned-to-the-foam bit from her mouth and stamps it out into the carpet "whatever. Got bowls and stuff back at the room. Y'want?" Half-lifting the pitcher in your direction, half toward the hall - whatever the reason she's not giving up the pitcher(s) or the rest of her loot. Probably that beady-eyed tourist-kid over there looking to score a tossed box puts her off toward her room. Like the walking-wounded, her posture stoops and she shuffles down the hall. No point in hanging around when food has been offered. Of course, its the beeline into that beady eyed kid that does it... he's blind in one eye, and looking back at the counter puts the tourist into that blind spot instances before the punk drives an elbow into the boy's temple. Whoops. Looks like we  have a clean up in aisle four. Vulture spits the top of the box at the downed kid before he strides off after Penny. A couple of strong steps helps him catch up to the overloaded woman and her dragon horde of breakfast stuffs. Munching loudly on Tony's flakes the birdman swallows before offering a,  "Y'practicin' f'bein' a bag lady? I once saw this fuck'n chick, she had like, a fuck'n loada shit... but then, she had'a fuck'n cart, an y'don'..." A shrug of one shoulder, and more profanity, "Y'gotta name, Cereal killah?"  BANG bang bang taptaptaptap tap.. tap. Thunk. Thunk. Thunk. Sounds like metal  on the crapwood of the door. Thunk. "Guuuuuys, wake up" mumbled into the door.  Thunk thunk. Thunk thunk.  Already at her door, Penny kicks at the door. BANG bang bang taptaptaptap tap.. tap. Thunk. The metal pitcher knocks into the door. Thunk. "Guuuuuys, wake up" mumbled into the door. Thunk thunk. Then her head, thunk thunk. She pleads quietly through the peephole "Guys I can't get my keeeeey.. Pooobs c'mon.."  She just might not've heard your question, taken to whining at a closed door. Best to bet Penny needs to be asked twice while she's distracted "HellooOoo.." kicks at the door again.  Time for a little divine intervention. Vulture steps up to the side of the door and blasts a couple of hammer blows into the firedoor. A couple of good steel toed kicks as well, "OPEN UP!" Is the less than melodic bellow, "WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! THIS IS THE POLICE!" Oh, sure, then he leans against the side of the doorframe, folding his arms across his chest. One ear cocked to listen  for movement inside the room. His lips, of course, are split into a wicked grin of mischeivous malice, "So... y'gotta fuck'n name, or what?" There's that question asked again - cause he can.  There's some scrabbling from inside. Sounds like plates being knocked about,  something goes smash. Then silence.   Knock knock. Comes the reply.  There is the sound of a door slamming open, and then closed.  Penny stands aside with all her shit and lets you stay there in front of the door. Casually she leans  on the wall with a no-good-can-come-from-this look toward the ceiling. "'Course I do," gravel for a voice, her eyes rolling that way - toward you, the noise and the door. "Uch. It's up," Penny observes with some melodrama, some ill-will and takes a step to the left. Saving introductions for later, she  nods that way across the hall, "Might wanna" indicating you should move before the door opens.  And so the carrion bird perches himself a good foot from the door. His hands drop away from his arms and hang at his sides, Vulture's never been known - yet - to be caught with his pants down around his ankles. He half glances at the door and then looks back across it to the less than verbose woman, "S'good t'have a name..." He comments singularily, before stuffing a few more frosted flakes in his mouth... chewing noisily. He even starts to tap out a tune on the molding with the heel of one boot, stuffing the unopened box into one of his deep pockets. This should prove interesting.  //.etro: Pobble rolls "chemistry+intelligence" privately to Penny at diff 4.          For a total of 6 success(es) including 3 ten(s). //.etro: Penny rolls "Dexterity + Dodge" privately to Pobble at diff 6.          For a total of 4 success(es) including 2 ten(s).  The door whips open, and a beaker flies out. There seems to be some kind of  contraption stickytaped to it. Maybe another container within. As this  happens, there's the smell of sweet flowers and a light mist which errupts  into flames.  Amidst the conflagration of scent, the beaker smashes. So does its counterpart.  Oh. My. God. Mister Smelly Time. Acommpanied by a thick acrid yellow fog. Nice.  The door slams shut. A small voice calls out, "There's no one home." Another sound of the interior door slamming. And.. wait. It sounds like.. something trying to climb up the door.  Penny knew it was coming. It's like she's psychic or something.  "Mother fucker," see - she's in the right place - to the LEFT of the door.  "Shouldna said you were the cops," asiding to you like it's good advice. Penny  kicks on the door "you open this door Dave or I swear to FUCK I'll skin you  myself."   BangBANGbangbang.  She coughs a little, shielding her nose and mouth in the pile of boxes and food. "It's just fucking me. ME, PENS. God. Just open the door, I swear to god there's no fucking cops."  Light dissapears through the peep hole. There is a sigh, something scrapes the door and the lock clicks shortly followed by the sound of something small hitting the floor.  "Penny you fucking brass hat."  Laughing. Oh yeah, the punk is busting a gut. He's dropped Tony on the floor, he has one hand over his mouth and nose, and he's laughing so hard he could puke at any moment. Leaning back against the wall Vulture looks like he hasn't laughed quite so hard in a long time. A long, long, time. One hand waves, trying to sweep away the vile smelling smoke. A pause in his uproar, just long enough to say something along the lines of, "Fuck'n paranoia... I love't..." Hard to discern, it's the hand that muffles it. Hell, he could've said, "Monosodium Glutamate." And it would have sounded vaguely familiar.  Gripping the handle from the farside, Penny shoves the door open with her free-ish hand and lets it swing wide. "Least I get some, hairball." Bit on the venomous side this morning, Penny practically spits that. "Practical joker," an apology of sorts and waits, waving you in first "Mi casa.." She's not particularly amused; probably had too rough a night for nonsense like this.  The door is stopped by something. No one to be seen inside. Just a mess. The thick acrid stench drifts within as the door remains open.    Pobble is apparently in the bathroom. With the door open, David is nowhere to be seen.   Vulture ahs, and nods.  Keene has connected. Keene has disconnected.  Penny looks left then right and holds the door open for Vulture, shoving the door open wide as she can. "Yeah," a few boxes finally tumbling out to the floor and whatever else crowds it "COMPANY," she calls out though it seems there's no waking the dead in these parts. Sounds from the bathroom mean there's at least one person over there; noises from the floor beyond the second bed means there's at least another body that side. Only clear spaces seem to be in between beds and two small spaces between the closet and desk areas. "Breakfast," she nudges a sleeping bag on the other side of the bed. When it doesn't move, she moves on to the lump on the first bed "Comps you livin'? Eh.. " Setting up stuff on the minifridge, Penny grabs a bowl for you, one for her and one for whoever's in the bathroom. "Help yourself..." looking for a name.  From the bathroom, there is a faint gurgling noise and then the noise of someone sucking through a straw.   From under the bed, a small voice says, "Oh holy christ." with a tone of sheer terror.  Hammering the door shut behind himself, "Vulture." Looks over at Penny briefly before he surveys the room. A nicely sinister smirk is on his lips, and he tugs the box of cereal out of his pocket to pop the top off of it. Despite his lack of a second functioning eye he seems to be able to take in everything pretty well. Good spacial awareness, "Nice fuck'n pad y'got here..." He comments as he carefully steps his way over to the minifridge.  Penny crosses paths with you, moving toward the bathroom, stepping over a pile of shoes here, clothes there. Cables piled up next to the door; lots of brown packing boxes still taped up and labeled with smiley faces, headphones and/or arty-glyphs. "I hate this place, thank god it's just temporary.." bang bang on the bathroom door "oi, needa skin up" looking back over the bodies, taking a stab at who might be in there "wanna sha, Pobs. Fuckin'monkeybrains gave us the stink. Brought breakfast." Knock, knock.  "I don't shag coppers," comes the call, its a world weary and vacant voice. The voice of a soon to be coma victim.  There's a big gulping sound, and then the noise of someone apparently falling to the floor. Glass tinkles. Someone vomits rather violently. "They're... comming. Through.. my nose...                 cameras in my.. nose. You fuckers won't take me."  "Dave.." The voice gets weaker and weaker. "Kill.. Kill Penny the copper.." Dave apparently wants to stay under the bed. Whimpering. Vulture taps his tongue stud against his teeth for a moment or two as he spills the contents of the Frosted Flakes box into a bowl, keeping his gaze anywhere but where it should be. Murmuring to himself, "This is what'ts like... what't's like when worlds collide... this is what't's like..." As his eyes pass by the bed, he tilts his head to the side, "Hey," He stops his singing for a moment to ask the most potent question --> "When did I fall inta th'TV? This's a Rob Zombie video, right?" Pulling the cereal box up to his face he points a finger at the fucking tiger on the box, "Y'come alive, Tony, an I'm'a take back my childhood, y'crack dealin' fuck'n feline quadraped..." Crunch. Squishing the box those eyes finally rest on Penny, "S'okay f'I grab some milk?"  Yeah yeah," distracted, she has her ear to the bathroom door. She tries the handle murmuring "Uch not again.. the fuck is peachy.." asking the handle, not the voice under the bed. Finding it unlocked, Penny shoves her way in saying "Yeah um, really sorry about all this," with half a backward glance, "..pranksters. Tough to live with y'know? Help yourself.." her good humor forced, checking to see if you're more into the milk than what's behind Door Number 2. Yes? Yes. Good. Penny gives a final shove and slams the door behind her. No peeking.  Inside is a chemical mess. Aparatus set up to drip something into the sink, with the faintly familiar smell of LSD. A straw floats in the pool, and next to the sink is Pobble. Looks like he's been sick through the nose and is sweating and shaking profusely.  Something under the bed whimpers some more. "He's falling away.. bye bye..... bye bye.."  It's true, Vulture is more interested in a healthy breakfast than whatever someone may be throwing up in the bathroom - or whatever. He pools milk into the bottom of his bowl, watching it slips and slide all over the flakes, "Drown, y'lil' bastards... drown..." Yup, cause it's mentally stable to talk to your cereal, "Y'd think that Lewis Carroll woulda come up with more've a concept than this.." Evidently the carrion bird still thinks he's in some sort of wacky land of make believe. Before he takes his first spoonful of his soggy flakes he pops a couple of pills into his mouth and swallows, "They know who you are," He sings to himself, "There know who you are..."  There's a lot going on behind the bathroom door. Since you're already in the right frame of mind to picture it, you've no trouble at all imagining Penny-Whipthin dragging a body across the short tiled distance or what kind of tinkling crash a glass makes when it's swiped off the counter. The dull echo of booted-feet in a tub. Sound of the shower being turned on and a lot of tinny, echoey conversation happening. In between there are solidly formed phrase "hospital again" and "not even a week" or "Keene'll shit a BRICK" or "fucking monkey." Take your pick, it's all Penny talking anyway.  Following the sounds of water are screams. Real agonizing screams, the sound of someone being terrifyingly mutilated by rabid creatures of death. Words grasp to make themselves understood through the pain-static noise but to no avail. It sounds truly horrendous.  Penny has managed to pick your ass up through some miracle of leverage and keeps talking to you despite your lack of response "I am NOT taking you to the hospital again." She hobbles with most of your weight on her into the bathtub, gets the water on ice cold at full blast "You think I need this shit? It's fucking freezing out there. You know what they'd do if we brought you back there? They'd look at me and Keene and say 'not even a week' and he's dosed hisself good'n STUPID again." It's a two-step thing and you're no help with all the screaming "Fucking delerious, Keene's gonna lose his shit is what, shit a brick aww.. c'mon, wake up." Ducking down, now your face is in the water "Up, up y'go. C'mon Steve-O it's just me and the lousy old shower."   From afar, Pobble flails about wildly, trying to move out of the water as if it were acid of the corrosive kind. His hands claw at his face, perhaps trying to protect it but not doing a great job. Red lines appear, and his cheek breaks open releasing a blood trickle into the flow of water.  Vulture pauses. His cheeks are puffed out with the monstrous spoonful he just stuffed in there. Eyes wide behind his shades. Evidently someone doesn't like taking showers very often. Slowly he commences chewing again and swallows. Curiousity killed the cat... it's a good thing the punk is more often seen as a bird. He steps over to the television and pokes it on, tuning in some godawful religious telemmercial. Watching it with kind of a half interest considering he isn't in the least bit religious, "C'mon, Jimmy... tell me I'm goin' t'hell.... then show us y'daughter's tits and tell us she's a whore." Well, at least he can keep himself entertained, glancing back over his shoulder at the bathroom door in caution. The water makes the screams louder and Dr Steve thrashes about, smashing his arms against the side of the tub. Those'll be some nice bruises. His face bleeds more under the water, and a clawed hand desparately tries to pull at the wound. In between the screams the man coughs and splutters. "Fucking Police Brutality" he manages to cry.  Screams, splutters, coughs and choking noises are followed by a strangled call of "Fucking police brutality."  Someone is getting murdered.  Outside, someone else errupts into a coughing fit, and there is the sound of glass breaking underfoot. "Oh god, I'm going to hurl." can be heard.  From the bathroom, "UP, up.. c'mon" blurble, blurble and then during the commercial break come more screams. More thrashing and the bad noises. "Fucking Police Brutality!" then a thud.  "You fucking cunt," said with an it's-for-your-own-good friendly menace "that was MY face you just scratched. EARTH to CADET," wet slap-slap sounds prolong the episode in the shower.  The TV gets turned off... nothing Reverend James can say will add up to the fun sounds coming from the bathroom. Vulture wanders over, still stuffing his face, and stands next to the bathroom door. Off to the side like. Listenning in. His gaze goes idly to the bed where the voice was coming from before, another couple of scoops of cereal beginning to drain the bowl in which it resides. His head bops along to the soundtrack playing in his head as he does so.  "Dave.. they're killing me.." comes a weak cry. Then silence, then more screams. Then silence. Thrashing, thudding. Silence.  From under the bed comes a shrill cry, a cry of pain and anger and frustration. A tiny shape darts out, running with speed straight at Vulture. Its a monkey, in a suit. Along the way, it deftly grabs the previously discarded steak knife with a monkies-only dexterity and dives at the biker, knife first. "Noooo." it screams, seeing Vulture as guarding the door to the violence.  A squeak-squeak and dripping sound tells us Penny's turned off the shower. And she starts shouting "WHY AM I BLEEDING?" WHY. AM. I. BLEEDING?" with all the authority of The Authorities Pobble's been railing about all this time. Another squeak-squeak sounds like rubber soles stepping out of the tub, whip sounds like thrown towels and she drill seargents "GET UP. GET UP."  Pobble seems to have lapsed in to some form of comatose state. He twitches violently, then is still. Twitches again. Then still. Breathing is shallow. Although wet and soggy, he looks like he's burning up. The LSD continues to drip into the sink.  A punch, yeah, the punk would probably let it land. A knife, on the other hand, would leave a lasting impression. Vulture has too many of those. Even as the monkey is quick, the birdman is quick. Spitting out his current mouthful of Tony's flakes he drops the bowl to the floor - yet holds the spoon evenly in his hand. Sidestepping rapidly out of the way the Carrion bird drops his shades onto the end of his nose, "This's FUCKT!" He exclaims, a grin rippling lengthwise across his lips, "Y'wanna go? Its go time, Curious George..." Apparently, unlike other criminal elements in this city, the mohawked one just doesn't carry anything that can be considering a weapon. So, in pure Tick fashion - SPOON!  The door to the bathroom opens behind you and like providence, Penny's hand grabs and pulls you inside the bathroom. Slams the door. "Erm.. uh.. hi."  Whirling around, spoon held high for the kill, Vulture looks stupified and ready to rock and roll - all at the same time. He blinks, not once, but a whole bunch of times, "Th'fuck?" He peers around the bathroom, half expecting a knife carrying suit wearing talking monkey to come flying out of the wall at any moment. Of course, that's what happens when you're dreaming. Right?  The tub's running now. And Penny's soaking wet, red slashes on her cheeks. "I'm SO So so so so so so so sorry about that." Wide eyed, Penny is convincing and totally believable. "My friend" indicating at what's behind the shower curtain in the bathtub "left one of his programs running. Stupid lasershow bullshit. All that cable and the computers on the desk," a little out of breath she pauses here, flips the toilet seat and lid down and sits "he's mad fucking cool but he's totally fucking crazy. Thing was cycling for shutdown," looking at a much waterlogged watch "like at 10:30." Put into perspective the whole Dream theory gets chucked out the window. Ever the curious sort, Vulture opens to the shower curtain to take a brief peek, and then looks back down at the woman on the toilet. You. He points the spoon, "Well, this's certainly been a fuck'n cool night... no word've a lie. I ain't never been attacked by a fuck'n monkey n'a suit 'fore..." With his free hand he pushes his shades back up on his face, "Y'might wanna throw a couple o' dressins on y'cheeks, tho'... laser show'r not, y'boyfrien' there did a number on y'face." The whole computer lingo thing, for the most part, goes right over his head. He can turn one on and loosely surf the net - but everything else is Greek. wipes at her face with the back of her hands "Be fine," though she winces. "The whole stinkbomb thing is part of this like.. treehouse security system he's rigging up for our new place but .. this just isn't working. A monkey in a suit? So fucking lame. You weren't fooled were you?" Rhetoric, she knows you weren't. Elbows on her knees, Penny shivers; wet clothes don't really do much for her now do they. "I gotta get the place cleaned up 'fore the rest of them come back," still a little embarrassed by the whole affair "this is ridiculous. Catch up some other time, eh?"

      Eaton Centre - Northern Wing(#579RJ)       Upon entering Eaton Center you are struck numb by the awesome size of the  place. Bright light shines from the glass domed ceiling, casting dazzling  reflections off the tiled floor. It is four stories of commerce, complete with  the dominant mall subculture, White Trash. You can't turn your head without  seeing kid leashes, mile high bangs (you estimate that the hairspray it would  take to make hair defy gravity like that would create a substantial hole in  the ozone layer), and prepubescent boys and girls waiting to be picked up by  their mothers.      A rent-a-cop sleeps on a chair directly next to the information booth  where an old lady reads a copy of the latest Danielle Steele romance novel,  looking anything but helpful. Directly behind that is an island of payphones,  all with gummed receivers and bathroom poetry etched on the plastic surfaces.      Many stores bespeckle the mall landscape, but all are under the  impressive wing of Eaton's department store. Eaton's stands as a direct  contrast to your first impression of the mall. The patrons are all well  dressed, the sales people amiable, and the wares are exquisite.                               This is a DAYZONE                               It's midmorning, and the Centre is /packed/ with last minute holiday shoppers. Poor husbands too busy normally to do any shopping, are now zipping around trying to find the 'perfect' gift for tomorrow morning. There are some frantic women, and teens and people of all ages. Politeness and courtesy, have melted away because of the last minute hysteria. Ah ... the holidays.  Penny wouldn't normally be in a mall but she's a woman on a Mission (from God, totally another story). She's one of those people that hates the holidays but loves the presents and has come to this nexus of Hell & Beyond prepared. In one hand is a list and the other a fist (pocketed of course). She walks with purpose through the burgeoning crowds and carries a look that moves gravity as  a force away from her. She's here to shop, don't mess with her.  That seems to be the attitude a lot of people have. There is a tension in the air, that seems only aggrivated by the stupid piped musical version of 'White Christmas' that is sung, poorly, by the Toronto City Chorus. Or maybe it's just the recording that sucks. And yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. His fat ass is sitting right over there, with a line of kids two miles long waiting for the $25 a pop opportunity to sit on his sore lap and beg for presents. Some are lucky enough to be able to afford the photograph too.  Penny's got skills. And the advantage of looking like she'll punch people in the mouth for that tie or those cufflinks. In one of the normally tastefully appointed men's stores she's elbowed her way into, the holiday-temps have festooned the mannequins with santa hats, pierced the suits with ornament-hooks and lined the walls with blinking lights. This wouldn't be a problem but for the simple fact that the lights have started to strobe and blink out of sync with the timer - and it's started to look more like the inside of a club than the local version of Brooks Brothers.  There is constant background noise as well, of registers, ringing in purchases, spitting out receipts, the dialing of credit card machines ... ah ... you have to love capitalism. Some of the stores have gone above and beyond, and are circulating, giving out free sweets of sorts, but mainly, most are just too busy. Shelves are left unstocked, and the cases containing the merchandise sit nearby, since the help is just too busy to unpack it. That doesn't stop customers from helping themselves to the materials inside however.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 2 success(es).  //.etro: Penny rolls "dex" at diff 5          For a botch!  Boxes and boxes. And so many people. Penny starts perusing quietly and with limited movement. Any casual observer would say she's a little stiff and tense, even for a last-minute shopper. A clerk with a straightrazor comes around toward a mess of sweaters and oxfords half-ripped out of the cardboard and she stands aside with a woman clearly harried and ready to get out of the stores already. Penny's hand moves to the small of the woman's back and gets tangled in the cord of her purse when they get shoved by another group of rabid customers.  About thirty seconds later Penny goes "..shit" under her breath and tugs her hand away, gets more stuck and hey, isn't this awkward.  The woman who's purse your hand is caught in turns around, and yanks on her purse, hard, "ExCUSE me," she says, loudly. Loud enough for the clerk to hear. And you know, most stores these days have electronic survalliance. How much do you want to bet, security saw your bangled up attempt too?  All at once and without pausing, she hunches her shoulder inward and gasps "Oh my god, I think he cut me" and looks at the woman with wide, frightened eyes. Look over there? The clerk with the box cutter looks terrified and confused. Her posture screams 'lawsuit' and he immediately positions himself with the straightrazor in the Other Hand, trying to nonchalantly go back to his job. But there's so many people, like so many trapped animals circling and diving for the kill. "Help," quietly to anyone. It's building, this hysteria.  Christmas eve, the perfect time to get all those last minute presents. Or, in some cases, all those presents. Snow glinting on his furry coverings, the unlikely christmasophile saunters happily into the shopping center, rosy cheeks and serene smile in hand. Sidestepping casually he avoids being bowled over by happy happy children, screaming at each other in their endless joy. Reaching into a pocket, he draws out a handfull of change to drop into the carol singers basket while he scans the shops for likely candidates.  Follow the strobing lights and the generalized distraction and you'll find Penny. Maybe. The locals are getting hostile, jabbing items with senso-tags at security guards; waving receipts like white flags in front of them "I paid for this! I paid!" Little children screaming and crying because that's what little children do. Mothers and fathers with more bags of wrapping paper than actual gifts, with boxes, with ribbons and bows. Colors block out the patterns of the mood swing - gargantuan red bows there signal overwhelming feelings of helpless frustration, flashing gold lights in their centers. Gigantic wreaths and streamers of green keep the consumers moving into the stores and buying buying buying. Green goes in, green comes out.  There is chaos, and there is the furry island of calm, standing next to singers who gradually become more and more distraught as their small fence barrier is jostled. Flicking in and out of tune. Pobble begins to drift through the crowds, patient and zen. He stops, waits for openings and slips forward. Eyes scan for the least populated shops. Even masters have their limits on patience. He chuckles at something, shaking his head with a last glance towards the singers before they're lost in the heaving sea of frantic proles. He makes his way towards a flight of stairs, and stops next to it in a  small lull in the shifting tides. Reaching into a pocket, he pulls out a bright blue flip phone and idly taps in a number. Days like these, one needs a shopping partner. Or a mainline injection of coffee. Of all the shopping malls in all the cities, Pobble had to pick this one to walk into. There's madness here; a fever pitch brought on hour-to-hour and minute-to-minute. Walking, talking holiday memes: Santa Claus is coming to town - anticipation, he knows when you're awake - paranoia, jingle bells - cashier noises. You Must Buy. Spend money, appease the seasonal gods. Spend money, everyone will thank you. Spend money, there's love for sale.  Penny is carefully extracting herself from a difficult situation down the doomed corridor. Burdened with bags, the flashing christmas lights in the men's store have become too much holiday for her. Doubled over, she sinks to the marble floor outside and pokes around her tied-on bag to make the ringtone stop. "What, I'm losing the fight. Oh god it's awful," she says into the phone.  "Most unlike you dear." states Senior Pobble into his phone. Nearby someone blurts out, "A blue phone! Where'd you get it. I want it. Hey, this guy has a blue phone."   At first ignoring the lanky shrill toned man, Pobble interjects as the creature-of-impulse reaches for his phone. Pobble puts a hand out, and pushes his bloody palm towards the monster. The sight of the wounded and oozing hand coming for his face is too much for the shattered mind of the last minute shopper, and the man looks about frantically while backing off. A new thing takes him, clutching at straws and he begins crying out again, "A coat, that man has a green coat! Hey, look!" and he runs off, to paw at random man's old green coat. A must have this christmas. "Why are you so calm," Penny stays seated underfoot and out of sight with the phone pressed to her ear "Did someone just try to rip you off?" She sniffs and there's a rustle of paper-and-plastic bags "Everyone here's going crazy. I think I just got slashed" says this thing casually "I don't wanna look."  "You're here?"  In the background are the sounds of the Salvation Army Band. A group of four players and one nun with a bell. It's unending noise jangles nerves and keeps everyone far away, not tossing coins into the metal bucket. Find them and you'll find her.  "Of course." Pobble smirks, "God wishes he could be everywhere else but here. I think he's starting to forgive you." His voice is calm, controlled and continuing the pattern of the past week. The sounds of the chaos through the reciever attest to the fact that yes, he is in the same hell as you. "I'm at the bottom of some big stairs." Turning slowly, he looks about for a better landmark. "Think you can make it to the information booth?" That sounds like a plan, everyone is too busy to ask for information. Information erodes shopping time. Everyone knows that if they stop to ask for direction, the bargain that had their name on it will be bagged and taken.  "I can't. Go left and you'll see a dancing banana," a landmark if ever there was one. "I'm afraid."  Penny seems to not have moved an inch since putting the phone to her ear. People are walking around her now in and out of the store with the strobing lights.  "There's a guy in a bearsuit, fu.. Pobs?"   Pobble stops and twirls gracefully. Spotting said Bananna he smiles beautifically. "I see.. I'm not far away." Waiting for a space, in a manner not unlike a game of Frogger, he moves towards the victim. "Never fear, Dr. Steve is here."  Surely enough, he isn't far away. The connection goes dead, phone slipped back into pocket, and the furry chemist eclipses the strobes over the prone woman as he crouches down behind you and puts an arm over your shoulder.  Whispering into your ear he says quietly, "Be not afraid." A slight smear of blood graces the purple leather where his hand sets down before it moves, so that his fingers touch your cheek. Another hand reaches into his pocket once more.  But Pobble your hands,..." she cautions and fails to mention what big eyes he has (the better to see you with), what strange things in his hair (the better to hear you) and those things marks, those marks on his forehead (and never you mind about that). This is something that no shopper wants any part of, that no shopper wants to see. Perhaps they confused the color combinations - that red wasn't on her coat, it was on the wall behind her. It was in a poster, an advert on the wall. It wasn't in his hands. Penny must've mis-spoken, she must've seen wrong. She must be on drugs.  The hand emerges from pocket, holding something. What it is, lost in the shadows and blocked perspectives to any that would be watching the couple out of sight huddling at foot level.   "Shh.. You trust me right Pens?" he says looking into the woman's eyes with that zen smile. The hand fidgets at Penny's side, before gently pulling up her top just a minute ammount. Shielded in the crevase between them, and still with his fingers touching her face, Pobble eases a syringe into Penny's side. Silver serum out, syringe vanishes.   The chemist closes his eyes for a second, twitching almost imperceptibly before leaning in further to kiss Penny's forehead. "Happy christmas."  Penny looks upward past the Judas kiss; consider the ecstatic having a visions, collapsed then into a fit. The woman weeps; she must be crazy. The cellphone tumbles from her hand and gets kicked away by a thousand pairs of feet. A child notices but so, too, does his mother and tugs him away from them; from the trouble she knows them to be. The little boy still reaches for the phone, its color and size toy-like and attractive. A lost cause.  The security guard that was looking for Penny might find her now, bleeding from the side as she'd suspected when she slipped past him. Her blood moves quickly and spreads across the tiles.  The serenity has cracked on the furry man, and with a weary face he moves to stand, attempting to bring Penny up as he does so. A tear runs down his face as he begins the ardurous task of leading Penny towards the exits and out of (in to?) hell. He moves slower, his expression a Frappe of sorrow and a McFlurry of wearyness. Opening his coat he wraps it around Penny, big enough as it is. Glancing to her as he waits for an opening, he smiles. A very old, very tired smile. There are no words. Just a break in movement before they continue on out. The phone lost in the forest of feet, and the blood just another pitfall in the Temple of Doom, waiting for an unwary hurried automaton to come crashing down on its slick surface.

      "Red hair, wacki chica." Chase responds between sips. "Dress all D.R." Sitting with his thick shoulders to the door, he's propped on a stool and talking to Vulture behind a wall of cancerous nicotine. Brooding over a mostly finished drink, his weathered hands go about the mundane process of describing a height. "You know... wacki." That settles it.  "Wacky, huh?" Vulture is kind of half seated on his stool, one hand on his drink, the other moving to rummage around in his pocket for... ah, there it is... a Chupa Chup. A red sucker. He begins unravelling it slowly, "Fuck, Chase... wacky chicks are all I fuck'n know... s'th'way th'world works.." Once unwrapped he pops the sucker in his mouth, and then takes another swig of beer. A grimace. Yuck. Oh well.  [Enter: Penny, speaking of wacky.]  She goes hey at Chuck and beelines for the bathroom. Twitchy girl with a sneer trekks her bad attitude off to make it better, wet footprints in her wake, one hand pushing open the buttons of her coat. Slipping to the inside left, she disappears shouldering open the swinging door at the back. Bright yellow light shafts through the haze of smoke, sharp sound of a face being slapped (corner of the phone/restroom area - a man and woman) then the thudding sound of the wooden door slapping back on rusty springs.  Chase missed the passing spectral train that was the copper girl. Though he did catch the 'hey', and for a beat his red gaze peels from Vulture. But there's a cigarette to finish, and the last drink of this round. "If we depended on wacki broads ta keep 'r runnin' round, she woulda stopped first bloody day of the month."  Still grimacing from the nasty mix of Stout and Candy, Vulture just nods. He picks up a napkin and wipes his tongue off a couple of times to get that fucking AWFUL taste out of his mouth. A moment later he's succeeded, and makes a decision... he pops the sucker back into his mouth and pushes the brew away, "I s'pose... still... can't live with'm, can't kill'm, can't even gett'm n'th'sack..." Wow, that was cryptic. As it was, he too missed the beeline. He'll catch it on the way back.  The fight between the pimp and his bitch is still going on; it's getting louder and making less sense. Penny's propped open the door with her foot - some precarious and strange leaning between the two doors; everyone can see the arguement's moving into the ladies' - well, everyone that's not busy racking up, stacking up, pushing the cue. Not a lot, actually. She squeezes through the door, jacket catching on that shitty iron handle ripping open the buttons of her coat again. Before she can catch it a little black case skids out under a high stool. Opting for a cool and smoove approach, Penny tries not to look pale and frozen, feigns an interest in the gameplay where the stool's positioned.  And slowly she sinks down behind big men with their backs turned; sharks circling the tables shouldn't have time to see her reach between the rickety legs, grab the little thing. Shouldn't see her edge carefully around that stick-holding post.  There's more sitting going on, Chase slowly raises one shoulder to adjust it. Like a forklift, his actions are mechanical. *Sniffle* Nostril wipe, he throws back the last bit of whiskey bitting into the ice cube that accompanies it. He speaks again, muffled through a mouthful of frozen water. "I rrrr 'aaaat," there's some crunching, "That yer woman with the stuff in 'r face?" Vague gestures of piercings about the lips when the scuffle pulls his attention. A look, "P-Diddy" under his breath. And to those beyond, a 100 yard stare. His eyes could be crosshairs.  Charice comes into the pool hall slowly and takes a look around at the new look. A smile graces her face as she sees something in here she likes, which isn't that rare for the woman.  Hopping down off his stool for a minute, Vulture holds up a single finger to indicate to Chase that he'll be right back. BRB. With that he strides into the ladies room and one can hear his voice a moment later shouting something along the lines of 'SHUT THE FUCK UP!'. Several bone jarring thuds are heard, and the pimp goes silent. The prostitute, she can be heard giving her thanks until another couple of thuds resound. Now she's quiet, too. The birdman steps back out of the bathroom and heads back over to sit on the still nearby his comrade, "Uh..... what th'fuck were y'sayin'?" His fingers wrap around his glass again - but this time he takes the sucker out of his mouth before having a swallow of his drink.  Moss is following behind Charice with a smug looking expression on his face. He stops a few feet inside the main pool hall and gives the place the once over. He pulls out a pack of smokes and a zippo while he's doing this and lights up. He turns to Charice and nods his approval.  Jarrod follows Moss and Charice in. His eyes gleam and he appears to be in an excellent mood. He moves smoothly, looking over at the pool table and cocks his head to the side curiously, looking like he's trying to remmeber something.  Ya, there's Penny. And a crowd of people enter as a scuffle is ended near the bathroom by the birdman. He returns to a seat next to Chase, who seems momentarily blinded by the extra purpleness of the girl's jacket. But he managed to watch Vulture go about breaking up the ruckus, in a somewhat muted, yet amused state. "I was talkin' wacki broads, cabrone." It's a response to the man as he snuffs out the cherry of a spent smoke when he returns. The last wisps leaking from his detached smirk. There's more people to spot, but the thick 7-11 mascot waves Penny towards the counter. "Oi, Becka."   Beating down a pimp? Probably not the brightest thing Vulture ever did in his life; this part of town, this sort of estabishment brooks no smugly grinning fools. But he did leave a stool free there beside Chase and Penny, reassessing her situation what with the retucking of case to inside pocket, friendless and alone, misses the opportunity to stroll over casual-like. Instead she makes some vague hand-gesture at Chase. It's almost like a wave but also almost exactly like someone curling their fingers into a hang-loose pantomime, then looking to her left she swipes two fingers from right to left across her jacket sleeve. Lazy bastards flinging butts. Maybe she's checking for burns when he calls out to her. Cutting a profiled glance back toward the bar, her blue lips render a crooked half smile.  Charice watches Moss move out of the bar and then shrugs, turning to Jarrod now. "Let's get us a table or something so we can talk, alright?" She moves over to him and puts her hand on his arm lightly, "Been here before, have ya?" tugging on his arm a bit as she looks around for an empty table for the two to sit at.  Vulture has never been accused of being the brightest guy around. That's for certain. He wipes the drying blood off of his knuckles with a nearby napkin. It's the violence. The violence inspires lesser men to do lesser things. With a yawn the birdman looks around himself before replying to Chase, "Uh...yeah... wacky bitches." That's about it. Having started his adrenaline flow it's time to go find someone else to turf. Or get turfed by. He slides off his stool and throws a couple of bucks on the bar to pay for his drinks. "Yo,Chase... take'r easy... we'll seeya later."  Jarrod is tugged along by Charice. "I'm not sure. Seems familiar though. But I think the place I remmeber had a different name."  "Buenos suertes, Vulch." For the departing bird, flying off. The narcotic haze is obvious, Chase holds up the metal sign and hand nods in the air. 7-11 orders another whiskey keeping an eye on his back. Always on his back. He doesn't miss the crowd, not a person, but it's time to shoot the shit with a pal. Lazy towards Penny, there's pretzels that come under attack. "Thanks for the thing at the place with the guy." His greeting to her.  Jarrod read your description.  Charice looks around at the tables and nods to Jarrod, "Yeah...Crazy 8's. That was it's name." She frowns at something, turning too look over at the door like a caged up bird now. "Jarrod...let's..umm..haul, okay?" Tugging on his arm so he will follow her once more.  Jarrod seems a bit surprised to be getting tugged a different way but nods. "OK." He glances at Charice curiously and smoothly follows her toward the door.  Penny always turns up. Penny always gets in the way. It could be formulaic; someone oughta do a study, finance a survey on just how badly Penny does this. She totters briefly on her stacked heels and shuttles to the right giving the guy with the mo' wide berth. She stares at him, eyes like pinpoints, before going "..oh" fairly quietly and without much ado. Half aware of the bartender, she holds up her fingers - two fingers, the index and the middle waiting for him to notice. Yes? Have we seen? Yes. "Good," unaware that she herself is speaking, Penny's bloodless smile eases into another de-nada expression "Any time, any place," scooting in toward the pretzel-shaped mess on the bar.  Right out the door. That's the way the punk travels. Vulture is at one with the street a moment later, his hands stuffing themselves into the depths of his pockets. Have feet will travel.  Vulture opens the door and walks out onto the stoop. Vulture has left.  Charice grins at Jarrod, "I got an itch to ride is all. Come on.." she makes her way though the bar quickly as she can, with Jarrod at her side.  "Right now..." Chase looks back at the door as people enter then scoot off like trepid animals. "You scared off the lot of 'm, eh?" Back to Penny, a few bits of dead pretzels fall from his lips as he speaks. "You see that one? With the hair?" Again, he makes the extremely inaccurate portrayal of someone's height with his palm. "The chica? With the red...? That there, 'n the mohawk." Some scratching under his chin, he says it all secret like. "They ain't right."  Penny does that thing where she swipes two fingers across her breastbone again, right to left. And she lets you see it, giving it some weight, some impact. "It's the drugs. Amps my latent ability to spook the spooks.. " stepping up on the low rung, Penny leans her body-from-the-hip across the bar and grabs a handful of ice and a handful of olives, sits back down "That kid? Yeah he's a little.. fuck, *I'm* a little.. "  Her slouch just now isn't an affectation; she just absolutely can not readjust. Like her muscles have given out for a few, taking five. "How'dja meet'im?"  "Be careful 'a them lot. I pulled some bloody bastard from her jaws one night in the middle a the street." Chase reached for another pretzel. His stained make it a point to bite down on the salty treat in a crunching fashion. "More fuckin' whiskey." He says that to himself, then aloud in real time to the tender. "Bushmills." And back to P-Diddy. "Fixin' on lunchin' his soul, the fucker was."  Figuring you don't mean literally, Penny goes on with her olives and ice; popping one and the other melting in the usual fashion. She reasons "Snack's a snack, oi?" Snickering at her own inherent humor, Penny explains in her further unconcerned, fixed-and-dilated way "Piggy'n the old man'a pulled me outta some shit I never thought I'd get away from..  but they're just guys .." rambling on "they're just guys and get trained from diapers they get to be on top, s'not their fault really. All that bullshit social programming.." Some sympathy edges out but not much else; bent as she is.  Drink arrives with inconsequential timing, Chase welcomes the whiskey to it's new home. "You don't like 'm on top?" He swats the ball back into her court, picking up a few broken pieces of snack from the counter that threated to fall under foot. "I mean... whatever." *Crunch* and sip, this could sustain him through the apocalypse possibly. "What kinda shit does Penny get into, where she plays damsel?"  Penny gets an itch. Not the kind of itch you can see, it's something lingering behind her eyes and she drops the ice, knuckles touching deep temple tissue for a few. "It's not like that, fuck that. Fuck bait. Fucking no fucking way." All this take an extremely long time for her to say, can't quite seem to get the blood to boil in its usual manner; the invective lacks truth. Disinterested in the olives, she drops them, too, underfoot and picks up a drink that may or may not be hers. Just to hold it, wrap her fingers around it. "That's not me. But y'know sometimes you gotta get outta the house man. Livin'with all those guys makes a girl ..whatever. Whatever I can say it, I made some bad fucken choices man but they got my back is all. Is all I'm tryin'a say."  "So you think they all rolled together?"  "The bird's owner, she got crap in her face." Accurate. "Ya know, studs 'n whatever. Buncha piercings. Dunno. I don't get that one. I mean, can't ya get pretzels stuck in there 'r some shit? I knew this chic had her neck pierced..." Hands barely fit round his horse neck in description. "Like this. Like a necklace. All round. Grossed me out, 'specially when it got infected." He -totally- makes a grody face. "Fuckin things were drippin' clear liquid. Fuckin gross!" Chase almost yells that last bit, and remembers what he was asked. "I mean, yeah. The bird's owner's pals with the redhead. Gonna munch away, she was. On some poor cabrone the bird beat down." A shrug."Ya know, i couldn't just stand there 'n let 'r have at some beat down puto. I'm tellin' ya, that one..." Fingers point at the door, "that one was 'bout ta lunch."  "Shoulda let the monkey have him," her comment mostly under a breath, half spitting whatever she sipped. What IS she drinking? She takes a good look at the glass, tries to focus. "I hate Jameson," taking it personally though really it's no one's fault but her own. "Should give'em som'what Pobs foiled up for me. Set'm right on their asses is what. Won't be no one's problem." She bites down hard on her lip, shoves the glass back to the bar. "So what, you go all vigilante now?"  "Naww...." Chase waves that off. "Me? Comeon." A dubious look. "But ya know, they were bein' sloppy. Fishin' in the public pool, front 'a all sorts a eyes? You do someone like that, give a Colobian neck tie, you don't do it next the local internet cafe. That just tells me they're dumb, and deserved the fucking with I dished out."  You say, "..IS kinda stupid, innit."  Penny swings around on the stool and observes "So maybe it wasn't me what scared'em off, hey?" She punches you in the shoulder "Fucko, should let a girl in on the down low." Losing her balance, Penny starts to slide and catches long enough to get right briefly "..fuck," murmurs "cab me, get me home okay?"  "Lightweight, i'll take ya home." And he stands, slamming his untouched whiskey. He does that kinds thing not to impress, but to -suppress-. Lips smack in a yummy sound, "Smooth." Mr. Furly! There's some head shaking goin on, Chase is jarring loose his driving skills from their mental self. Some bills are placed on the table, he looks back towards the bathroom as the pimp starts to regain his senses. "This place is dead anyways."

      [ed Note: Penny sucks at magic, blames God-in-Pobble's-head]  You step into the bar. Overdrives Alley - Main Bar(#6632RlJM)       This is the large, open main room of a rowdy biker bar. Near the entrance  is a single bouncer who casually looks everyone over as they enter. On the far  side of the room is a long, wooden bar with old, leather-covered bar stools in  front of it. Behind the bar is a long mural of a naked woman, sprawled out on  her side. The liquor selection here is fairly limited, but there's a wide  selection of beers to choose from.      Around the room are wooden tables of varying sizes, surrounded by wooden  bar chairs. Along the wall across from the bar are a few booths. In one  corner, next to the bar, is a door marked 'Staff Only'. Opposite it, on the  other side of the room, is a staircase leading up to a more private room.  There are two old, battered pool tables to the right of the front door. They  charge a loonie per play and have a limited selection of pool cues, none of  which are in good condition. A juke-box sits next to a small dance floor that  is rarely ever used for dancing.                               Places available                                                                NIGHTZONE                                        The street out front is visible through the only window in this room.  Contents: Pobble Antigone Seth    Seth read your description. Seth read your description.  Long wooden bar (#1) has 10 empty places.  Large wooden table (#2) has 6 empty places.  Small booth (#3) has 1 empty place.    Present:   Pobble   Round wooden table (#4) has 3 empty places.    Present:   Seth - Antigone   Large booth (#5) has 6 empty places.  Battered old pool table (#6) has 4 empty places. Pobble read your description.  Pobble sits alone at a booth. Two beers sit, one for his invisible friend perhaps. His attention is focused on a journal which he scribbles in..  Seth is seated with Antigone as they talk quietly and relax. Antigone has a beer infront of her and Seth has a glass of Tequilla and a bottle of it infront of him. Antigone read your description.  Antigone settles back a bit from Seth, shrugging her shoulders. "Left her, then left me - go figah," she murmurs, perhaps a bit louder than she intended too. Her eyes shift to tak in the new arrival of Penny, eyes narrowing slightly at the signs of abuse on the other woman.  Someone was holding the door open letting in the frozen north winds. Not many people are walking in with it. There IS Penny, though ignoring the bouncer and the comments, shaking snow from the mantle of her jacket and dusting off the brim of her cap. She flashes open a wallet for him; probably picture id of some kind and moves further into the bar, a stiff-legged trek toward the back.  Seth shakes his head and sips his drink. He seems slightly amused at something. He turns and watches Penny walk in and head past them.  Penny moves away from the door, and Pobble glances up towards it. The lines of vision and motion fail to cross in the brief second that the man leaves his writing and he looks back down and continues the scrawl. A hand reaches absently towards the beer. As he grasps it, he lets go and twists his book about, writing something quickly across the top line. A small red stain is left on the cool condensing caraffe.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Pobble at diff 6.          For a total of 0 success(es). Antigone arches a brow at Seth, leaning slightly back in her chair as the pair contiunes to speak. She gestures absently toward him with her empty beer, and then looks about for the bartender.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Pobble at diff 6.          For a total of 0 success(es).  Penny changes direction suddenly, this not being such a crowded place, for the jukebox next to the dancefloor. One hand in her backpocket, one to lean on into the machine. Its lights make her a glow of red, a wash of yellow then green. She presses the button to make the options change, keeps pressing the button. After the third time she finds something appealing, the green glow glinting off her white teeth - her smile displayed just to the selections there. She pulls coins from her pocket, punches in numbers and turns away. Her song comes out of the machine, Lou Reed doing his thing while she stands there looking pointedly at the booths. "I'm waiting for my man, twenty-six dollars  in my hand" he sings and the band plays behind him "Up to Lexington, 125 feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive.. I'm waiting for my man."  No no no. Thick lines criss cross the last section of work, and intersecting lines and words are hastily resurrected around it. The new sounds cause the man to again glance towards the door, but it doesn't last. While writing feverishly, he maintains that eerie calmness and again reaches for his beer. A line is drawn, Pobble looks satisfied at something. He takes a moment to sip the swill and survey the surroundings, searching surreptitiously for a smoke.  Antigone begins to laugh at something Seth said - a full bellied, full throated, all amused type of laugh. The laugh causes her emerald eyes to dance with green falmes, and her dimples flash in the light - even if briefly.  "Here he comes, he's all dressed in black .. beat up shoes and a big straw hat."  Penny could be singing along, her mouth moves but nothing audible comes and she does this thing with her hand when Pobble looks up; she's in his sites now - thumb and pinky fingers splayed then she swipes two fingers across her chest. Probably that guy at the bar got a little sloppy with his drink.   "He's never early, he's always late - first thing you learn is you always gotta wait. I'm waiting for my man."  At first, Pobble doesn't recognize the girl staring back at him from the bar and his gaze moves onwards, but then he backtracks. He offers a smile as he finds the cigarette, holding it up before him and flipping it about in his fingers. It comes to a stop pointed at the beer opposite him. Popping the cigarette into his mouth, Pobble shrugs. His now free hand makes a vague motion of hanging loose before he flicks a V finger formation at the girl and takes up his pen. The writing continues.  Antigone shakes her head a bit, a waitress dropping off a beer for the woman. She takes a long pull, then settles back more fimrly in her chair.  A whole verse has come and gone by the time Penny makes her way over to Pobble's booth. The Velvet Underground's churning now, burning out the speakers with "Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares. He's got the works, gives you the sweet taste.." Music spurs her on and with her other hand she interrupts the flow, drops something in his book. She takes the cigarette from his mouth, fingers close around the filter and drags. "Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste. I'm waiting for my man." She also takes the pen from his hand, turns the book to face her and writes something down. Making long, deliberate eye-contact with him while the song winds down, Penny turns the book around and walks out with this cigarette.  Pobble pages: Looks like complex chemical formulae and notes written into shapes of crucifixes and steepled churches.  She wrote: God's fucking with the frequency, Kenneth. Also, come home. We're packing.  Unpreturbed by the apparent violation of his workings Pobble stands, gathers his belongings and leaves. The two practically untouched beers remain on the table as the fellow heads out into the freezing cold.

      Given the hour, Penny should be asleep. But there's things afoot in the bathroom. Light under the door and a rustle of paper being shred from a book and torn further.  A muffled, half whispered "Shit." The crystaline sound of breaking glass - thin glass and not much of it.  The entrance door clicks shut, and Senior Pobble steps in cautiously. The sound of glass breaking causes his otherwise serene poise to slip. Bathroom. Glass breaking. Sounds uncomforting to a restroom-chemist. Scanning the shapes in the darkness he begins the ardurous trip to the next door and raps a knuckle against it quietly.  The door pitches off your knock. There's Penny half-crouched over the toilet, her bare foot on the seat. Little leather case tipped off the counter, syringe shattered in the unlucky fall "That you, Pobs?" stage-whispered "Keene's not still here is he? Come in, come in..shh.. hurry. Careful" already tweaked, she throws a damp towel over the glass and gestures to the ice bucket next to the  sink. "Pick."  Pobble slips in, pushing the door quietly behind him. His hand leaves a smudge of semi-congealed blood on the white surface. He looks awfully pale, the usually preternatually wide pupils shrunken to pinpoints. Leaning back against the door he offers a shrug, with a smile of zen calmness. "I don't have one."  "You have to pick," her voice going thin, twisting into a peculiar accent where 'pick' sounds more like 'pay-uck'. The tongue too tied by another pulse,another drive. "Week's up," tipping the lid down, Penny sits indian-style trying to keep her eyes open and haivng a miserable time of it.  And squinting at the wall's new colors "Where'd that come from?"  Spreading open his hands, Dr Steve reveals this winter's fashionable Stigmata look. The holes don't look too fresh but are still oozing. The tranquil smile remains as if stuck to his lips with glue, and he looks up towards the ceiling off to the side for a second. The smile widens and he shakes his head before stepping forward to the ice bucket and looking inside. "I have no idea what you're larking on about."  "Put your hand in the bucket and pick one."  She says this, says "hay-und" and "buh-kit", achieving a kind of lopsided balance with eyes closed. "S'time to switch. We do this every week Pobs, quit fuckin'around and pick."  "Oh. Right." he says, hand reaching in and russling about. "Penny. You look fucked. Did you know that? Fucked." A slip is grabbed but he doesn't look at it, he leans down to stare at your eyes. His lips twitch as if he's thinking something over, and then he nods. "We agree."  Her slivermouth smiles; muscles tighten in her jaw on the left side. Off kilter. "We have not been fucked, have we? Can't help what we pick. It just comes knocking. We can't help it can we. We can but we shouldn't." Things get very still for her then, maybe she stops breathing. "Don't make me talk anymore. Hurts my teeth."  Compton has connected. The bathroom door is closed but there's a light on. Conversation going on behind it. To early to put a fine point on it, sounds like Penny and Pobble.  Pobble pulls a cigarette out of his gogglestraps and places it between his lips, "Sunday." he says, unravelling the folded paper with one hand. A zippo is withdrawn and shkt and puff puff. A hand pats his jacket, leaving damp sticky spots. "You want something to take the edge off there love?" Little noise, little whinge, little snif. A tightness has overcome the framework, taut like a drum. "Better, yeah" a short nod. Flexed fingers and hand extended out expecting. "Feel stuck, tire stuck." She knows what she's talking about; you might not but sense isn't part of this dialogue. Her eyes  half-open, touching your fingers, the buttonhole of the cuff "You're stuck, too, aren't you."  Pobble shakes his head slightly, keeping his eyes on yours. He looks only mildly perplexed. The unusually with-it Dr Steve is an ocean of calm today. Crouching a little more he replies, "I am not stuck. God is stuck." The words are only mildly mutilated by the keeping of the cigarette between his lips and retriving it after speaking.  She puts two fingers on your wrist and takes the cigarette from you, bones in her elbow popping. "God's gotta go." She says it this way, casually, the kind of thing someone says about the kid at the party freaking out in the corner after someone spiked his drink. "God's definitely gotta go," dragons out the smoke "crashers are so over."  "God can't go. He's not a crasher.." He stands, once more and winks conspiratorially. "You'll see.. in time, you'll see."  A hand reaches into his pocket and he drops a pair of small oval yellow pills onto the counter beside you. Leaning back down he plants a light kiss on your forehead and turns to slip out.

      [ed Note: Chase shows Penny how he does bi'niz. And vice versa.]  Holiday Inn - Room 174 The lamp is ringing.  You'd swear it's the lamp ringing. There is nothing else on the nightstand but that's where the sound is coming from. Fiberboard that echoes; carries an antiquated briiiing noise; the Holiday Inn - resting place of all outmoded means of communication. And because the alarm-with-the-flip-digital-clock-and-radio tells us it's around 5am, we also know it to be God on the other end.  Or, according to Penny's half-mumbled tirade from under cover, it better be. Or else.   Her arm pokes around at the desk, flops mindless and knocks into the nightstand's drawer. Phone in the drawer. The ringing stops and "Hrn.. nafuc..ya. YA," come cottonmouth responses. Phone back in the drawer. A phone so old it makes that half-ringing sound when its hung up. Or knocked into by a half-sleeping Penny. "Offaracesghuysbacklate."  Awful hallway light yellows the floor and ceiling as she leaves.  Air Canada Centre - Lord Stanley's Mug:  The house that Lord Stanley built, the city even. Yes, December, the NHL's in full swing, and out of towners and pilot are tweaking over some coffee and checking out last nights scores on the screen. But not Chase. He could give a fuck. Sitting there in his 7-11 shirt, he looks all too outta place. That's why he called for backup. Gum -and- cigarette going at once, he broods over coffee near the window as airboat land beyond.  It's a sports bar. It's open all hours. It is, if nothing else, accommodating but it's not good enough for Penny. She comes up on the place virulent and shivering bent on a few things; making it quick and making it easy. Anyone can see it if they look; still crusty her eyes have that red-rimmed glaze and her body is closed up, shoulders hunched, hands in pockets. Morning-after hair could be the final clue; this just isn't Penny's morning and it's going to be One Of Those Days. So she's taking it personally; Everyone else has that just-washed or just-landed look. Everyone else has an excuse for that little-too-oily/little-too-old-for-this sheen and it pisses her off because they all want to talk to her. Ask her about her hair. Ask about her make-up. Ask her about the foot and a half of snow caked up around her boots. "Fu'off" is all she can get out of that twist of a mouth, quiet up until she gets to the window "..hi."  Could be a greeting but really, it's a cry for help..  From his reflection in the thick glass, red eyes pull and rise to Penny. Chase doesn't look especially tired in comparison. Not anymore than his usual amount of slack. The bloodshot gaze and 10 pound sacks don't excessively heavy this early morn, and he even manages a cheery smile. "Thanks fer comin, chica." Nose rub, *pop*, the smell of coffee and smoke, he shifts to kick out the seat opposite from him. "Cop a squat, 'll buy ya some mud, eh?"   Penny would take off her coat but a misted layer of icy snow keeps her buttoned-up a little longer. Instead she leans into the cheap metal shield covering the radiator - industrial and substandard enough to make that loud/empty noise they all make. Loud enough to disgruntle a snoozer at another table. "Mmng," an affirmative from thin blue lips, nodding up "mu's'goo," teeth belatedly chattering. "s'noprob," she lies "s'up en ee way." Dropping from her coat in larger chunks now, the frost shakable, Penny starts to unfold from its confines slowly. Eyes still half-lidded, coffee *would* be good for her, slide the malaise like the slush from all that wet nylon. She drapes it across another chair and drops into that seat like a ton of bricks.  It so happens that the coffee Chase was gonna buy for her is the one he was sipping on. It's mostly there anyways, seventy four percent of it. And already dosed with enough cream and sugar to make it smell rather pungent. And duly, it nudged forwards. "Don' worry, 's just 'family' coodies, ya know. So then, Becka, how's the hubby's new cat? I hear those hairless fuckers are hell ta raise." The man across from Penny starts in familiar tones, as though speaking to an old friend or relative. Under the coffee that's nudged towards the girl, is a stained napkin. Conspiratorially, he points a callused finger at it. "Got the mud just how you always take it."  Penny hates a ruse. Penny is so straightforward she may as well be an arrow. It's possible she's too tired for this, it's likely that the moment she picks up the cup that coffee will slosh out and burn her fingers and there's no doubt she'll need more. For now, Penny just puts her hands around the mug like a kid with hot cocoa, sinks low in the chair and affects the kind of smile that's not a smile but a crease in her forehead and dimple in one cheek. "Yeah but no hairballs," totally deadpan. She starts to pick up the mug but there's some block; a lack of snapping synapses. Motor skills at zero rpm. Keeps her eyes on the circles vibrating in the mug.  "-JUST- how you like..." Chase repeats through pursed lips. "Right... Becka?" His manner prompting, impatient. Shits always stress with him. Eyes creep to one side, then back. A pilot claps his hands at the bar, Vancouver beat Dallas. Some peanuts are slipped. From across the table, an obvious throat clearing and nudge at the coffee and/or napkin. An attempt to jump start Penny's motor skills.  Her left hand fidgets with the handle of the mug, starts to slide if off the napkin just a few yawns short of making meaningful eye contact "Yeah yeah," a slow, low drawl. A convincing signal-to-noise. No need to coach, she's got it all under control "S'got just the right," going in for the big yawn; full body stretch. "c'sistancy. You always know how to get the color right," no need to adlib or fill-in with something clever. Penny yawns again and sips without hesitating.  If one were to look, from in close, with an eagle eye, they'd find ball-point pen scribbling on the napkin. 'Drink and watch' is what is says. Who knows. Chase squints his eyes a bit as Penny tests the concoctions. There's the distinct taste of oranges, an odd hint for morning java. "I outta, you 'n yer college friends would make me cook vats a this shit when I was on shore leave." He finally continues, nodding his head and looking less pensive. *Pop* Eyes out towards the window, he advises, "But uh...don't drink too much, I putta lotta sugar in there. Enough give ya a nasty buzz from the whole cup." Back to Penny he turns, reaching for his smoke to add some flavor to his gum. A healthy drag, and larger cloud expelled.  It's not healthy, all this stealth so early in the morning. So what's to see? Some geezer tipped over on a stool. Flight attendants congrating by the entrance. Coupla guys reading papers. These things hold no interest for Penny. These things are as mundane as they are plentiful. Maybe she just doesn't see it yet. Clarity of vision has not come; she's not caffeinated enough. This morning is wearing thin on her; she's doing her best not to throw back the whole mug, doing her damnedest not to drum her fingers or rub her eyes, touch the fuzzy parts of her hair or toy with an earring.  Because we are being low fucking key.  "I remember that time you came back from Bora Bora," half her face in the mug, eyelashes, eyelids, eyebrows just above the rim.  The nook between nostril and cheek get's fingered, Chase leans a tad forwards in his seat. his hand drops to his stomach, and a nauseous memory drifts over his features. "Shit girl, that was -before- the surgery. Ugh. Fuckin' Asian Trots. I swear ta fuckin' gawd, that bowl twister was longer than the snake in Anaconda." But his eyes are telling a different story. They're not focused on vague flashbacks of foreign diarrhea, no. They're needle sharp, squinting at a spot three inches above Penny's eyes.   And then she hears him really. Oh his lips keep moving, describing in detail his battle with the toilet upon his return, but in Penny's mind, he's saying something else. And here comes his voice, crisp and drowning out the nonsense his lips are spewing. "Here's the situation..." A flashing image projected in your mind's eye. Of... a man standing in front of Der Weenershnitzle, or something spelled much like that. He dawns the suit of a giant hotdog mascot. Chase's voice again. "There the hotdog's a U.S. custom's agent, he spotted my coyote in J.F.K. He's looking for a solo, not a couple."  Penny doesn't exactly go cross-eyed but hey, give a girl a little warning. She keeps her mouth on the mug to keep from gibbering something stupid or something period. Penny looks like she's experiencing that kind of hung-over disorientation when you wake up in your own bed, still fully dressed but can't quite recall when or how she got there. "What?" suddenly, a jump - a lapse in the conversation maybe. It was her turn and she missed a beat. "Oh, about Lance" it sounds like lay-unce, she goes on and on about the cat and its shots, and how horrible it feels - like a plucked chicken underfoot. Putting down the cup on the table, her hands move slowly out of sync with the conversation, toward your left. Her fingers are rolling a tiny red thread, straying lint from your sleeve, correcting little things about your shirt. And then it's kicked back, that image; recycled into two options with subtitles - the agent handled by a tearful grandmother with lost baggage or the agent with the runs, cursing the danish he's shouldn't have ordered. When she leans back, hands to herself, the afterimages start to fade; color turning inside out - burned off the retina of your mind's eye. "And he refuses to pick a flea collar without asking the stupid vet about four different kinds. Which do you think'll work? He trusts your judgement."  "Fuckin' spiked." He -would- say that. Chase shakes his head though, jaw still flexing on his pulverized chewy treat. "Of course. 'N make sure you keep that thing away from the nino. They steal baby's breath yaknow. Piss of grams if lil' Eubert couldn't show fer his briss because the gato sucked his lungs out." Wives-tale, an old one.   Mental tennis, Chase swats back. There's the man in a hotdog suit, and the image drifts from the mighty unkosher one, now floating through random faces towards the baggage claim. And through the wall. And into a room, fulled up with A.T.F. and uniformed customs agents, 'la migra' in LA. "He's miked to team, waitin' on Guermo." A narrative, and then a shot of someone's face. A grimy looking fellow, short, hispanic, wearing a 'Member's Only jacket and sporting a south american soccer mullet. "He's Guermo. We're gonna be mom 'n pop, hit the mark, and jet to the bathroom. The Hotdog needs to be there, and he needs to report back that an elderly couple came in contact with the mark. That'll give us five minutes to get to the bathroom. Payed off a baggage handler to open the hanger to us, i'm parked out there. You get 2 bills. Sound fair?"  Penny tilts her head down and laughs under her breath "You still read too much Stephen King," she shifts, looks at her coat and maybe at something that's a watch on her left wrist. "You ready?" moving like there's a meter that needs feeding; shuffling things out of the way, tucking chairs aside. "I gotta..." trailing off; some things don't need saying.  "'S do it." And up. Look at 'm go, Penny's a regular junior kingpin in training. Chase leads, it goes off like without a hitch, and the beard gets her geets. Thanks beard.

      Overdrives Alley - Main Bar Contents: Jesse  Sunday evening, just past Eight, and Jesse is circling the pool table, frowning in concentration. Judging by the sparse clientele, he's just running the table by himself. Judging by the trail of empty longnecks, he's been at it for a while.  Compton lumbers in. Weighted down by his heavy parka and a pool cue case he manages to navigate the main door clumsily. Stomping his feet a few times he leave clumps of slush behind and move in towards the tables himself.  "Winning?" the big guy asks sarcastically.  Jesse bent over the table, raises his eyes and grins under his hat brim. "Hard to say." He stands, lifts his cigarette to his lips, and raps his knuckles on the side of his head. "Crowded in here. Can't tell who's up and who's down. You?"  In the usual Invisible manner Compton raises his right hand in a hang loose sign, before pointing to the left with his index and middle fingers, "Breaking even." he retorts before shrugging his way out of the coat and turfing it on a nearby bench.  Jesse responds with a peace sign, taps his left breast, and nods. "Could be worse." He returns his attention to the table, speaking with lacunae and pauses, his focus on the last few balls remaining on the brightly lit sea of green. "So what's doing? Anyone around?"  "Pobbles fucked." Compton starts. "And I hear Penny's bent on some smack he came up with." He opens the case and draws two black aluminum poles from the case that he threads together. Fucking slick pool cue. Seems retirement with a gold card has its benefits. "Keene and Hiro's watching TeeVee."  "See Keene, tell him I'm down with the White Star. He can keep running P.R. with the Muckity Mucks, I'll run solidarity with the Zapatistas." Jesse, finally, takes his shot. Sinks it. Paces around the table without lifting his eyes, sweeping chalk up to the end of the cue, and begins staring again. "And we should get the mouse to give us the rundown on that Mecca thing."  Eyes squinting as Jesse hovers around the table, Compton seems to be deep in thought processing and translating your slang and ciphers in to meaningful strings of ideas. "Right." he says with all the convictions of a drunken prom date. "Who’s your man?"  Jim comes in from the street.  Jesse takes another shot, misses, and straightens his back with a frown. He tilts his head to one side. "Huh?"  Jim strolls into Overdrive's Alley, makes his way to the bar and slaps twenty dollars down. He winks to the bartender, and says: "One bourbon, one scotch, one beer."  Jim sits down at Long wooden bar.  "Yer Star, would I know him... and you gonna finish soon?" Compton says standing next to the pool table Jesse is playing solo on, "Otherwise I'm goin for a round."  Jesse points to the cue ball with his stick, shaking his head no. "All yours." He sniffs. "Little danzig looking mofo. You know him. We did laundry together, I think." Jesse turns to retrieve a longneck of Budweiser from the nearby beer puddled table and takes a long swallow. "Anyhow. Peaches can keep running his game; I just want him to be cool with me running this angle my lonesome."  Jesse sits down at Battered old pool table.  The bartender give Jim a harsh look, but he ignores it. "Come on man, deal it!" he responds. After a short while of rummaging around, the bartender grabs Jim's order and sets it before him.   "Ahhhhh!" Jim says, perusing his alcoholic cornucopia.   Talking, partly to himself, the bartender, and perhaps partly to the Holy Father as well, he says: "Since it's Sunday, I'll /only/ drink myself stupid. Promise." With a wink and a gulp, his bourbon disappears.  Compton props his fancy pool cue against the table and starts collecting the balls to re-rack them.  Gulp! There goes the scotch. Jim smiles broadly as he zips the burning hellfire down his throat. He begins looking around, and notices the pair playing pool, and nods to them in an informal greeting.  At your table Compton frowns for a moment shaking his head, like he's about to deny any knowledge of the guy - a reflex perhaps before the fog of various impurities of the liver lift and his brow crinkles up with recognition, "Right. That tough guy at the meetings. So he's cool then?" Compton asks with a hint of surprise in his voice. "Fuck me. I thought we were alone"  Jesse tugs at the brim of his hat, nodding in the direction of the bar "...Cougar." He turns, gesturing with his cigarette for the older man to rack faster. "Yeah, cool as shit. Got his six."  Compton finishes his preparations and collects the triangle. Stepping back he declares, 'Your break... Wanna shoot fer beers?'  "Naah. I got beers. Let's shoot for 'ludes. Piggy cleaned me out at Doom Friday night, but I hear you took all that and his shirt at hold'em when I passed out." Jesse, twisting his right hand to chalk his stick against the cube in his left, walks to the end of the table, grinning. "Keep taking advantage of the kids, you're gonna rack up a karma neither one of us is gonna like."  Isaac has connected.  "Just fucking shoot." Compton states. Obviously ticked for being fingered in such a dastardly crime and for taking shame from the wastrel as he digs a mitt full of horse pills from his trouser pocket and dumps them on the side of the table. "Eye fer eye, punk."  Jim looks over to Isaac, wincing slightly at the labyrinth of facial injuries. He then lights up a smoke, and begins to destroy his beer.  Isaac enters the bar, looking around warily, with a few flakes of snow already upon him.  Jesse bends, planting his weight on his hand, and grins up at Compton, then throws himself behind the stick, rising on his toes with the force of the break. Sinking back on his heels, he tilts his head to one side, gesturing invitingly at the table. "All yours, old man."  Jim finishes his beer quickly, and then calls to the bartender, "A pitcher of..." he recognizes Isaac, and looks over to him, "Hey... Isaac, right? What're you drinkin? Come on over here man, look like you've been hit by a Mack truck."  Isaac walks up to the guy and eyes him. "I don't really feel like getting alcohol anywhere near this..." He motions to the cuts on his face. He does approach and sit on a stool. Isaac sits down at Long wooden bar.  Compton grimaces at Jesse, like he's already ruined his night, "Aw fuck man, hold on. Lemme grab a pint." and stomps off to the bar leaving his cue on the table.  The 'pint' is in fact a pitcher of the house draft. (Most likely recirrculated swill from the trays under the tap.)  Compton then returns to the table sans glasses and just takes heady draughts from the lip of the pitcher himself, before wiping his mouth with his shirt sleeve and picking up his cue.  Jim laughs a hearty laugh. "You know, after knockin back a few, it don't hurt as much. Come on. Kieth's. I'm buyin." With that, Jim orders a pitcher of Keith's and two glasses, slapping his money down.  Isaac looks at him weirdly and shrugs. "Your money, I guess... What's got you in such a happy mood?"  Jim smiles. "Well, for one, I just started drinkin. For two, I got me a steady gig down at the Dubliner Pub."  Jim pours them both a glass, and raises his. "To life, liberty, and the pusuit of getting fuckin' shitfaced!"  Compton leans forward and braces his bulk against the table which groans under the guy’s weight. Closing one eye, he jerks his head aside flipping the top of the Santa cap over to the other side of his head and takes two long practice shots before letting go on the cue ball.  Isaac rolls his eyes. "You got a job at a bar, are your celebrating by going to /another/ bar to drink yourself stupid? That’s really smart, I'm sure they appreciate you not giving them business."  Jim grins. "I come here for the atmosphere."  Jesse rattles his stick loosely in his hand, slouching against the wall. "So what's with the brit seeing jesus?"  Isaac snorts. "At least some businesses don't change depending on the year..." He eyes his glass and finally gulps some down.  Jim smiles at Isaac's drinking. Then, encouragingly, "Come on, if you get drunk enough, I promise to drag you over to a booty palace, and we'll make asses of ourselves in front of naked ladies. Trust me, it's good times."  The white ball slams in to the assembled mass of other balls sending them careening about the tattered felt. Three go down. 2, 5, & 10.  "Beats the fuck outta me. Is a little weird, ya know? Even for Po-boy... Tables still open." Compton states and lines up for his next shot.  Isaac shakes his head at that. "Sorry. I'm trying to get Uta to understand the concept of one partner, and I need to set some sort of example if I'm gonna have a chance at it."  Compton lines up for a bank shot, trying to sink the 13 & 14 balls in the corner and center pockets respectively. Misses of cource, but it was a nice idea. "Fuck"  Jim grins and a belly laugh issues from his throat. "Women. I don't even bother trying any more. Take what you can get, and enjoy it man, looks like you could use some joy." Jim looks at Isaac's wounds, but leaves the question unasked.  Jesse takes another pensive swallow from his beer, without moving his weight from the wall. "I haven't seen it yet. Just heard around the room that britboy's gone all godfreak, and now Penn's with it." He sighs, shaking his head, and unfurls his slouch, walking over to bend over the table. "Four in the corner." Fluid movements from the elbow, the stick snaps, the ball falls. Precise. Measured. He walks to the pile of pills on the edge of the table, pushes three in Compton's direction, picks up a fourth and dry swallows it. "One back here." He pats the felt, bending again to line up his next shot.  Isaac takes another gulp and says, "This is what I got when I tried to be nice to a woman. Didn't even get to say a word to her before she slammed me into the back of a bar. She must be pretty skilled to have gotten me over the bar and into the beer shelf.... but who knows." Jim laughs again, drawing the attention of a few disgruntled bikers. "Man, that's classic. Like I said, take what you can get. Leave what you'll... get assaulted by." He takes a liberal gulp of half his beer, and puffs away at the cigarette.  "We've been cooped up in that shit-hole too long I say." Compton does say, and lifts his pitcher to his mouth again and sucks some more back leaving a film of foam on his 'stache. Damn, looks skuzzy. "We gotta get out before they have us going door to door with fruit cakes."  Compton guffaws in to his pitcher, "...fruit cakes..."  The one banks off the far rail and lands solidly in the chosen pocket. Jesse plucks another pill from the table, pauses to wash it down with beer, and looks back to the table, blinking and shifting his balance. "Seven." Then, a bit unsteadily, he taps the corner pocket closest to him. "Here."  Isaac wrinkles his nose at the cigarette, but drinks a little more of the beer. He doesn't say anything, but he looks at the two playing pool.  Compton steps forward and bends down, plucking the remnants of the chalk cube form the sticky floor before applying it to the end of his expensive cue, "Anyone talk to Dave about it? He'd know what'd possessed the limey shit I'd guess."  Jim continues drinking, and quickly pours another glass. "So, Isaac, what's goin on in your world, man. Other than the crazy chicks, I mean." Jesse leans forwards to line the shot up, nearly miscues, and fails utterly to sink the seven.  The thirteen, however, does wobble its ponderous way into a corner pocket. "Huh." Jesse stands, leaning on his stick, and gestures at the pills. "That one for me, or one for you?"  Isaac shrugs. "Just trying to get business together. I got a bid to make a custom sports car for a certain person in town, but I'm having some trouble getting the parts." Jim raises an eyebrow. "Really now? Well, maybe I can help. What sort of parts would these be?"  "Me. I'm highball... and friday. I could use another beer toots." Compton’s says smugly and spreads his legs and leans down for his next shot. "14, in tha middle." and sinks it.  Isaac shrugs. "I haven't organized it very well yet, I'm pretty busy with the shop. Why, what can you do?"  Another 'lude makes its way over to Compton’s pile, and he paces the tables a few times eyeing up his next shot.  "Goatfucker."  Jesse eyes the pile of pills, slides two more to join the two already moved towards Compton, and walks to the bar, fishing in his back pocket. A crumpled knot of currency s withdrawn, untangled, and counted through. A strange snarl of suspiciously high denominations and chickenscratch. "Pitcher of whatever's cheap." Two bills are straightened, flattened, laid on the bar.  Jim grins. "Well, I know some guys. They deal in parts, and the like." The way Jim says that word, "parts", implies some sort of illicit aspect of the subject.  Isaac doesn't seem to believe Jim. He takes another sip and then says, "Well if I think you can help, I'll let you know. Anything I can't find, I'll probably make myself."  Jesse walks back to set the pitcher next to Compton's beer-in-progress. "Oh. Whatsis skipped town, so you may have to start paying for it over at the pot."  Jim shrugs. "I'm just saying, if you need a hand up, lemme know. Business is rough, I know it." With that, he takes an alarmingly large gulp of beer, refills his glass and calls to the bartender. "One bourbon, one sc-"   The bartender interrupts Jim with a guffaw in the midst of his romantic George Thorogood moment, and serves up one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer.  The 11 ricocheted off the 15 and goes wide. But the 15 falls in. "Aww shit. Fuck cunt bitch... forgot to call it." Compton says in irrational disbelief from himself. "Yer up slim."  Jesse, tilting his head to one side, stares at Isaac's smirk. He raises an eyebrow but stays still, leaning back against the table, legs crossed in front of him.  Jim gets down to some /serious/ drinking, taking both the bourbon and the scotch in quick succession. Apparently, in an attempt to murder his liver.  Compton circles around to Jesse and his beer, but stops when he catches Jesse's look, and gazes back the way he's looking. Adding his own considerable glare.  Isaac looks back at Jim and says, "Slow down, man. No need to kill yourself yet and besides, it lacks some originality."  Jim grins, and gulps down half the beer in a flash. He fires up another smoke, and turns slightly in his stool to regard the pool players, puzzled by their nasty looks.  Jesse snorts when Isaac looks away, shaking his head, and turns back to the game. Stretching broadly, he circles the table, then lines up the shot again, gesturing with the stick at the seven ball, and then at the corner pocket. A miss.  Compton gives up with the 'Fuck you. Die' look and goes back to hunting the elusive 11 ball.  Jim looks over to Isaac, and takes a long drag. In a low, joking tone, he says, "Making friends are we?"  Isaac laughs for a moment and says, "I don't think those guys like us watching their game."  This time it is a long shot down the length of the table to the far pocket. The shit is clean and dead straight and the 11 joins his brothers. With a smirk Compton goes for the chalk, "Some peoples larvae eh?"  "You didn't call it." Jesse picks up a pill, looks at it, and grins at Compton. "That's a penalty. One for me." He swallows the pill.  Jim grins again, but says nothing, option instead to finish his beer and suck on his smoke.  Compton's mouth opens and closes a few times fish-like, and his ears pink up. For e brief moment he looks like things are going to fly, but he turns to his beer and says a defeated "Shit" to the gods of dead nights buried behind the walls of this dive.  Isaac waves his hand to ward away the smoke and watches the closing game intently.  Jim's gaze is pulled towards the mural of the naked lady behind the bar, and he puffs whimsically as he studies her curves.  Compton adjusts the grimy Santa’s cap on his head and takes another belt from the pitcher, and continues a more subdued conversation with Jesse.  At your table Compton says "So, you ah... See the note? In the hotel?"  Jesse shakes his head no, leaning against the table again and waiting for his turn. He lights a fresh cigarette, eyeing his beer where it sits n the corner, and thinks about the distance to it.  At your table Jesse says "What note?"  At your table Compton says "Tha one 'bout who ratted us out to the papers and cops? Ya know the tapes..."  At your table Jesse says "Yeah. That's the White Star guy. The one who sent the note." Jesse finally musters the will and stands, padding over to the little end-table in the corner on which the cluster of empties sprouts. From them, he plucks a half full longneck of bud, and upends it, swallowing the last.  Compton stomps around to the far side of the table and points with his cue at the green and white 12 ball and says, with much emphasis on Jesse understanding him, "That fucking ball" then taps the pocket closest to him, "In this fucking hole... got that?"   Isaac takes another gulp of beer and then dismounts from the stool. He leaves a couple of dollars on the bar and says, "Take care of yourself."  12 ball goes down the hole and Compton sneers smugly at his handiwork.  Jim nods. "You too man."  At your table Compton says "That's yer man? Right on. We gotta get a crew together and go collect this shit."  Compton's next shot sinks the 4. Low ball. Scratch.  "...Yeah." Jesse, slow to respond, speaks thickly from a far away place. "Yeah, I get it already." He nods again, adjusting his hat. "Crew-wise, yeah. Count him in. We gotta get his six next week, show the colors a little." Jesse grins, sliding around the table to line up a shot at the Six. "Fuckers forgot what fear was." The shot misses.   Jim finishes his smoke, and walks out the door, nodding to the pool players as he leaves.  Jim heads out to the street. Jim has left.  "It pisses me off ya know? Here I take all this flak being with you guys because we're a bunch of terrorists..." Compton rants as he stalks the table again, "Yet they totally ignore the fact that they have a rat in the house. More than this fuck should take it up the arse. I didn't fucking retire and move here to wind up hiding my ass in the dark because some shit has a moral dilemma with our reality."  Jesse shrugs, surreptitiously taking another pill - that's six. And we should be doing things by seven, really, but Jesse's motor control is already slowing dangerously. "So? So it's not like we're not gonna shiv him, we get a chance. I'm just waiting to meet the guy."  "But it's the principle." Compton says emphatically, "I'm kinda old to be notorius ya know?" and lines up on the 8 ball. "8, top left."  Compton misses of course.  Jesse chuckles softly, moving to line up a clear shot at the six. The sedatives must be kicking in - the cue wobbles out sideways and caroms off the rails. "Fucker." Jesse stands, gestures to the eight. "Your shot." Compton grimaces at the 8 ball, as if to intimidate it in to behaving. "8 ball. Dead center."  Compton stands up straight looking pretty darn smug. He plods over to the remaining pills and sweeps them back in to his hand, which quickly disappear in to his pocket. "Suck it up punk." is his words of wisdom to the loser.  Jesse exhales faintly, and gives a vague shrug, reaching out slowly to lean his stick against the wall. "Huh. Damn. I wanted to fight that ugly dude, too."  Compton disassembles his cue and packs it away. Then dons his heavy coat, "Common, we'll go find god-man. He'll fix you up."  Jesse wriggles into his coat and nods, mumbling something and following in search of Pobble.  And The Laurel and Hardy of the underworld wander off in to the night.

      Penthesilia comes in, out of the bitter nights cold. She's covered in ice crystals, and looks like she's spent half the night in an ally. She also seems relatively unaffected by those facts, heads straight to the cig machine  Penny immediately removes herself from the payphone/cig machine area, winces tight "Players pull-thing sticks," some advice, but don't mistake it for friendly chit-chat. Penny drags long on a palmed cigarette and eyes the phone like she's expecting it to ring.  Penthesilia nods, and grunts once. Clamping one huge fist with a flat palm, she applies a quick, sharp blow to the side of the machine, causing a pack of Lucky's to eject. Sighing with resignation, she sucks one of the cigs out, and lights it up with a battered Zippo. Sighing heavily, she murmurs, in a heavily accented voice. "Christ. Out of normals. Have to settle for shit now. Thanks for warning." She removes herself from the cig/phone alcove, and sits down on the stoop  Penthesilia pulls out a book, and opens it up, staring not at the pages, but at a note stuck between the pages. She studies it intently, but the look on her face suggests that she might burn holes in it if she had the ability. Something about the note irks the hell out of her.  Penny drops back into another half-lean on a stool. Wobbling on approximately three and a half legs, it holds Penny up but only just. It's so quiet in here, what with both doors closed, you can hear the cigarette burning down. Hiss and crackle. The air in here stagnant and unmoving, smoke halos her instead of expanding up. She keeps looking from the phone to the street, to the phone and every now and then over to you.  A bouncer peeks his head out the door, makes a kind of nod toward Penny "Still here," he observes.  She goes "Yeah. Still."  The bruiser, let's call a spade a spade, makes a such-is-life shrug and closes the door, the yellow sliver of light cut back out of the stoop.  Penthesilia claps the book shut with a *BANG* in one large palm, and places it back in the battered army duffle slung over her shoulder. Slowly bringing herself up to her feet, she shakes her hair out, the ice turning into dripping rivulets in the warm air. She frowns as her Lucky goes out, and spits it out indignantly. Turning on one heel, she stalks over to you; pissed...not at you, but pissed. Pray that she is kind to whomever it is. Tilting her head, she asks in a rough voice "Hoy...you mind if I ask quick question?"  And the pay-phone starts ringing. Just like that. It's a loud, stuttering ting-ting-ring noise. The pocked and rusty thing has just the kind of dimensions that speaks of unreliable hooks and receivers that fall dead, often.  Still smoking, Penny's eyes shift from the phone to the advancing shadow/brick-wall and quirks a brow "No, go ahead." She says this calmly, near serene like she has the patience of a saint.  Penthesilia remains motionless for the moment, eyes sliding over towards the phone, "That for you? Answer first, if you need."  The closer you get, the easier it is to see - Penny's eyes-like-saucers. It probably isn't possible for her to get up again. "Ladies first, hm?" She thinks she's funny. The corner of her mouth twitches a smile on and off.  Penthesilia contines her statue impression. There is just a faint cracking of knuckles, as a clenched fist barely moves against a massive palm. She trembles slightly, as if something inside continues to build with each ring until it finally reaches a crecendo. Moving faster than her bulk implies, she nearly rips the handset off the hook, and yells at the top of her lungs a stream of foreign obsenities. Sounds Arabic, or maybe Hebrew. When she hangs up the phone, her mood seems improved, taking a deep breath. "There. Better. Okay."  She pauses, and then finally remembers why she came here in the first place "Hey. You regular here? Know something about homeless person, killed near here, not long ago?"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Your phone (or possibly another nearby) rings if you are ICly anywhere near it. OOC: Type 'answer Chase' - or 'options' - if you have a coded cellular, or page Chase to reply. Note that those about you cannot hear this message and you may wish to rp the phone ringing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Penny watches all this with placid awareness; like instances appearing through the water. She does not flinch or shrink at the violent gestures, nor is she surprised when not a second later the phone begins to ring again. It is persistant, it is hounding and demands a proper address. The system of levers and switches it takes to keep making the sound sound like they've begun to wind down, though. The ringing is also excessive and wastes the phone's precious reserves.  "Heard about something. Who's asking?"  The corners of her lips tug upward at that. "I am asking. You need name, you can call me Penni". Said with complete unawares of the amusing little situation Fate has just set up, in regards to the names people have.  Penny waits briefly for an answer but can't ignore the phone and can't endure another outburst. She tips off the stool, boots thumping across the tile, shuffling through butts and bottle caps toward the payphone.  (Directed into the phone) Penny says "You should be here," and her hand covers the end of the phone. She's talking to someone else now, a hard edge of suspicion underlining the question "You a cop?"   It starts with a few snorts, almost as if she were clearing her throat. It turns into a deep throated derisive laugh after a little more coaxing. "No. Am pissed off homeless woman who gonna beat shit out of man cops refuse to find."  (Phone) Chase is eating chips right into the receiver and being generous with the *crunching* noises. As such, it's several seconds before he's swallowed the mouthful of salty treats and is able to speak. And don't be dirty!   "What the shit girl. You in Afghanistan??"  Penthesilia grumbles "Fuckin' Republican, small dick. Think he can play Darwin."  (Directed into the phone) Penny tips her head that way, the cord of the phone twisting with that metal creak "Yes. God and I decided it was time to go walking through the motherfucking holy land during bombing season." You had that coming. "You know where I am. Just get here." Penny clicks her cellular to disconnect the call and hangs up.  Penthesilia smirks for a moment "It very overrated.  Penny hasn't looked away in the meantime. Her hand moves blindly, knowing the terrain of the phone, hooks it. These things all work the same way. "Yes, we agree. It wasn't meant to work out that way. But there was a m.." Penny stops.  Penny make a concious, visible effort to stop. But her mouth keeps moving at an incredible rate "..moment when one of those marys would've got on that cross /fo/ him and well. Something had to be done. You know how it is, always a man on top."  Abruptly this monologue changes. She lets go of the phone and tugs out another cigarette from the depth of a pocket. Doesn't light it, tucks it behind her ear. "Got a feeling they just don't know. They don't know a lot."  Penthesilia mmmms softly. Okay, maybe she can play with this delusion "Early Gnostic Christianity, used to be very female-run. Community groups. Matriarchy. Paul and others, put quick end to that. Now it all suck." She pauses for a moment, attention to get this train of thought to switch tracks "So what do you know, about person killing homeless?"  it's gone, the thread disappeared like so much smoke into the atmosphere. Her left hand touches briefly to the inside right. Penny keeps her hand there, holds or adjusts something hidden. "We only know what we see. There's a lot of /bad/ little boys running around this part of town. Ruins the atmosphere. Stick around this place long enough and you might see what I mean."  Chase walks in off the street. Chase has arrived.  As if on cue, Penthesilia looks over her shoulder at the man walking in through the doors. Penthesilia turns back to Penny, and mumbles softly "Yeah. Well. Thanks, anyhow."  Snow still on his shoulders, Chase walks in cursing the world in Spanish. That language not being associated with cold climates, it's little wonder he shows no outright love for the chilly weather. Boots stomp off some sludge as the thick man grooms his feet for indoor use. This is about the time his lazy gaze registers other forms.  Oh but he was expected. And he's no boy. Penny lifts some kind of elaborate, almost fingerless wave to Chase as he makes his presence felt, letting the wind blow in. She points two fingers to the left and smiles. With less obvious movement, Penny ticks the cigarette from behind her ear and extends it to him.  "I mean it. He thinks he's invincible. Needs to be put down, is what. Stick around," Penny searches pockets with her left hand, some slick damp trailing across her leather jacket.  "Tits."   That's for the cigarette that's needed to warm his soul. Chase can't help but to look up at Penny's new large friend. But it's a cursory glance, because what's more important than tall women right now, is FIRE! And out comes a zippo, orange flame's got the cure for what ails ya. It's held to the cigarette's business end as the thick fellow enjoys the first smoke of the new day... or is it?  Penthesilia tightens her jaw for a moment, pressing the small of her back against a nearby wall as she sits down on a rickety looking stool "Sound like you know him. Personal like."  Penthesilia blinks and suddenly tights, and if struck dumb. Like a bolt, she is on her feet, and barely manages to stammer out an explaination "Will be back. Emergency has come up." Penthesilia quickly stalks out of the bar, not even waiting for anyones reaction Penthesilia walks into the streets. Penthesilia has left.  "God tells me you're a treasure and wanted me to say thank you for last night. Well. I wanted to say thank you, he's just a gloryhound." Amazing she can deadpan that. Penny tugs Chase nearer by the pocket of his coat, her fingers move in and out, smuggling a cigarette from him. "Also. That kid with the mo's gonna buy it soon. Isn't he."  "Huh? Last night?" He's lost as to what he did last night besides mooch some of yer smack. Chase exhales as his boots scuffle towards Penny under the pull of her fingers. But he let's whatever it is that happened last night fly off into the abstract and moves on. "Who, Vulch? Dunno. I suppose if he keeps lettin' girls with lip piercings suck his arteries, he might. 'S not good for one's health, ya know." Tap tap. Ash onto the ground, to mix into the dirty snow.  "The ride, for the ride. Guy was," she moves her hand to her mouth, the index and middle spread and make a downward gesture and leaves it at that. "No see," pointing to the crumpled paper ontop of the stacks. It's folded open to and article about the dead homeless. "I think I remember he was asking around for hired hands. Worked for someone giving someone else the business."  Touching the cigarette to the corner of her mouth "Light me, hey?"  Duly, he does so. The zippo was still out, and snaps open again for a repeat performance. "Oh. Yeah." It's clear from his face, he's not a fucking clue. Chase turns back out into the snow day, vaguely spotting the large departing form of... well i'm not gonna repeat that unpronounceable name. But he thumbs back to her, "Sup' with the ogre?"  "Says her name's Penny. Wants a little payback." She inhales deep and moves smoke through every gesture "Sorry for that outburst, I couldn't stop her and god agreed it wouldn't be the wisest course of action to try and reason with her." It's all a bit more matter-of-fact than the Penny you're accustomed to. A little to everything's-alright eggs-in-one-basket.  "Penny meets Penny. Does that make you like... the mini-me in that relationship?" The zippo's finally tucked back away in one of Chase's bagillion pockets. There's some smoking going on, the thick dude peeks into the pool hall proper. "Let's get a drink, yo."  Penny tips off the stool again "Aight," follows you inside. "But no stick tonight. M'not so good with the leaning thing okay? More of the same slick appears on the stool's dark-stained wood and where she touches the doorframe. Chase opens the door leading to the pool hall and enters. Chase has left.  So then, scratch all that shite about snowy mornings 'n such. Because it's nighttime, yeah. Chase leads, he's good at that. Might even make a halfway decent Salsa dancer. Did I just say that? *vomit* Towards a table, he kicks at one of the chairs with a heavy boot and lets fly open the flaps of his long coat. Into the chair with a grunt, he's already eyeing the waitress.   "So then, I trust you fags got me note, eh?"  Penny drops into the chair, the study and won't fall apart chair, like a stone. Was she asleep? She keeps blinking, looking around. Huddling inside her coat, Penny slides her ass to the far edge of the chair so she's low. Inconspicuous.  "Yeah," like it's just coming back to her now, little enthused "yeah! That shit for reals?"  "Pffft?" Brows scrunch. "Of course it's real. Came from my ass." Cigarette still smoking, Chase is finally able to make eye contact with the waitress and it seems their table is high on the list of things to do for the working girl. After a lung's worth of inhaling, he turns back to Penny and talks more. "So then, whatcha gonna do 'bout it, is the question..."  Penny ashes to the floor, arm still extended ignoring the smoke "Oh come on," smothering a first response "It isn't a question, Chase.. " looking from right to left "..we'll be restoring things to their natural order." Tightly fisted, Penny ashes again and looks to the tabletop for a drink that isn't there yet. Nothing but wet rings and other people's napkins. "Simple."  A few silent nods, Chase understands. "'S about what I would do I suppose." And here comes Janet. Well, that might not be her name, but she bears an uncanny resemblance to Janet Dewitt from 'Three's Company.   "What can I getcha?" She asks, all sassy like. She may look like Three's Company, but she speaks like Flow from Alice.    "Bushmills on the rocks, please." Who knew Chase was capable of saying please. You turns to Penny as 'Janet/Flow' does, expectantly.   "And fer you, sugah?" Where the shit did she get a southern accent up here.  You say, "SoCo, beer chaser. Whatever's on tap" ending the order with a now-go-away tone. Penny isn't seeing the waitress, doesn't know whether she looks like Janet or Chrissy, fixed on the tabletop. Might put the waitress off a little but this isn't a place know for it's service, friendliness or particularly mild-mannered customers. Once she's gone, Penny picks up the thread again "Know where he lives?"  "Nu-uh. But that's not the problem, right? I mean, I could just trance out 'n finger his ass pretty easily." Chase responds, turning back from Janet/Flow to Penny/Penny. "or, get a mouse jockey on it. Ether way, that's not the hard part... Ya'll might get lip fer pulling something like that off. At least while the big cheese is in town. Might, ya know, wait till he takes his old ass away."  "That fuck's let him run around getting away with it. He can stick it in his /ass/ f'e don't like it. Shit, it really isn't a problem. Boy's got some fuckn'nerve."  Penny starts to shrug out of the leather jacket inches at a time, menaced by its sleeves and her side. Still low in the chair, she looks at her hand under the table, wipes it to the bottom no doubt across a sea of olf gum and gunk.  Chase smiles a bit, perhaps happy or amused with Penny's degree of angst. Ether way, it's a friendly response. "Fuckin' nerve, that he does. But the old stinker didn't know, or hadn't bothered to look into it. That's what boggles my shit." The cigarette is dyeing, and Chase sucks it's soul from the filter before gnashing it dead in the ashtray. And there's drinks, and talking, and more drinks, and smokes. And so ends another night with the dead enders of the world.

      Metro.  Middle of the night.  Somewhere on Mars.  Rolling Fields          It's a gorgeous sight, even in the dark of night, the brilliant yellows and greens of tall grasses waving in the chill wind, rolling hills stretching off as far as the eye can see. Pure, white stars shine in the breaks of the thick, dark cloud cover above, bringing a mild, yet still chilled, warmth to the vast expanse of land.         As you reach the peak of one of the highest hills, you are able to survey the land as the scent of life washes over you. Almost ninety degrees from the hill with the huge, gaping hole, and far off into the distance there is a massive forest, several deer darting into the trees as you spot it, as if sensing your discerning eye. Immediately opposite it is a large body of water, from which the cave stream flows. Ninety degrees from it, directly opposite the cavern entrance, there rests Novus Valnastium, a large stone complex resting atop another hill, one lone tower stretching into the sky above.         A little off to the northeast (assuming Novus is north), a small, metallic-bowl structure sits. Long tethers sometimes stretch into the sky from beyond it, connecting to a marvelous airship docked above the bowl. The slender curves and high-tech metals used on the small building are a stark contrast to the ruins just fifty yards away, and it easily gives away who is responsible for such a building.                                  >                                  Contents: Standingwater Obvious exits: Novus Valnastium    The Living Forest    Clear Lake    Hole in the Hill    High-Tech Workshop      Standingwater is seated before a fire at the usual gathering spot. He looks... irritated. Nothing new about that.  Keene takes his time moving out of the tunnel, muttering to himself about `a decent set of stairs, you fucking savages'. He has managed to avoid getting his shoes wet, though. Gradually, he makes his way down to said spot, standing for a few seconds in silence before speaking. "Hello."  Standingwater loses some of his irritabilty as he looks up from poking at the fire with a stick. Fuckin' savage. "Ah. Mr. Keene. Good to see you. Pull up a rock. Get comfortable. There is a job that needs doing, and the Invisible College seem to be the ones to do it."  Alex wanders out of Novus Valnastium in the distance, slowly closing ground until he has arrived in the heart of the fields. Alex has arrived. Alex steps out of the keep and head in the direction of the cavern.  Keene, invited for once, moves over and finds a relatively flat rock to sit on, easing onto it carefully. It's disingenuous to see a man in a suit and Standingwater sitting near each other around a campfire, but so is most of the Realm. "Alright," he says.  Standingwater tosses a bit more wood onto the fire. "We've had our differences over methods. But one thing I do like about you guys is your willingness to actually get out and do something. I'm a bit of an activist myself. My early years were spent in ecoterrosim before the Verbena came calling."  Keene slides a cigarette out of his breast pocket, waves it in the fire for a second, then brings it back and takes a mild puff. He listens.  'Ecoterrorism' catches Alex's ear as he nears the campfire. His head turns a little in the direction of the two men, probably a side ways glance in their direction from behind the shades.  Standingwater pulls his hat down over his eyes as he speaks. "We have a problem. Unfortuantly, working within the system isn't working. We need something radical. Is there something you guys can do to make the Hyperion site unsuitable for building? Say, a huge sinkhole? Generally unstable ground? Perhaps a radon problem."  Alex perks an eyebrow at Standingwater's request. "That sounds like acts of terrorism," he comments, not really seeming to personally find any problem with it,"People jumped all over me whenever I talked about doing such thing...."  Keene sits silently, having no immediate reaction to Standingwater's proposal. He puffs on his cigarette, gaze tracking to Alex for a few seconds before looking back to the native. "Let's assume for a moment," says Keene, "that such a thing was even feasible in this heavily urbanized area. What purpose would it serve?"  Standingwater shrugs. "It does sound like terrorism, yes. I'm only opposed to reckless terrorism. Materials and equipment should be the primary target. Attempt to minimize harm to bystanders. Sometimes lumberjacks get hurt when they cut into a spiked tree." His attention is drawn back to Keene. "At the very least, it would delay construction long enough for the legal process to go through. We must thwart the Ironteeth in their attempts to build a new base of operations. "  "I have already start working on getting a cease and desist order to stop construction until the issues that have been raised can be resolved,"Alex comments.  Cally has connected.  Keene smokes for a while after that, thinking in a meditative silence. He ashes his cigarette before speaking again. "This is a futile endeavor. Let me explain my reasoning." He gestures with his cigarette. "Alright, let's say some damage is caused to the site. If you make the ground collapse, you're probably going to hit a snarl of utilities and wreck at least a few city blocks. The city fixes it at great expense, and Hyperion probably gets another tax deduction out of it. If you go the more man-made route -- monkey-wrenching subtle or not -- you give Hyperion the sympathy of the people and destroy the credibility of protesters." He puffs on his cigarette. "The legal battle is a noble attempt, but in the end Hyperion will win. They have the upper hand on every front that matters in this fight. Simply put, an office building that will bring commerce to the area is more valuable to the city than a playground, which in itself has been shown to be ridiculous in the media. The Node is as good as theirs, and has been for some time. Throwing more time and energy after this fight is only going to consume resources that could be used elsewhere."  Cally comes out with the blueprints, and scraps of the Daedalus.. spare parts.. and an urn.. she walks to the area where the grass is glow in the dark blue.. and kneels.. as she begins to bundle the blueprints and scraps together...  Standingwater pulls an pipe out of his pack. And what a pipe it is. An eagle carved into the end holds up the bowl with its wings. "Okay. So we don't stop construction. Can we, perhaps, sabotage the node? Make it useless to them?"  "I don't know," says Keene. "Prime is not an area I know very much about. The Magister would probably know."  "So, is it your opinion that we should just sit on our asses while the Ironteeth build their Construct a block away from the portal to this Realm?..." Alex asks tilting his head slightly.  Cally stuffs the scraps in the urn.. and kneels.. "to the Daedalus.. For a short brief time you were my Valiant steed. A moment and we soared like eagles. We were invincible. Yet with my hope, I feel you died a noble death, and I swear to you, It shall not be in vain. your protegee will of course be strong and be built from the lessons you taught me.. " with that she begins to light the blueprints and scraps.. acrid smoke, some of it black begins to filter out.. and crackle..  Standingwater squints up at Alex, "El Queso Grande is working on moving the portal to a more secure location."  Alex smirks glancing over to Standingwater. "Yeah... He has been working on that for months now,"he comments with a slight shake of his head,"I wonder what will happen first... The Construct is completed or the Portal gets moved."  Keene puffs on his cigarette. "Please," he says, looking to Alex, "throw your head underneath the wheels of the machine. Don't let /me/ stop you. If you want to keep burning up your trump cards and psychic energy in an unwinnable scenerio, go right ahead. Personally, I only get into fights where there's a shot at coming out on top." `El Questo Grande' merits Keene's attention for a second, but he represses any reaction that may have come about. "I imagine moving the portal can be done in an evening."  Cally bows her head as the smoke flows.. "ashes to ashes.. chemical reaction to chemical reaction.. Particle quantums to particle quantums.. I now release the spirit, the soul of Daedalus to be reformed on the winds of Ether." she watches as the remaining items are consumed to ash..  "So, what do you think is a winnable battle?" Alex asks,"...Sabotaging traffic lights to cause traffic jams?..."  Standingwater tosses more wood on the fire. "Then how about a fight you can win? Mecca Pharmecuticals. I understand it's been around for a while, and word has it it's a Nephandic base. It should would suck for them if the ground opened up and swallowed the place or something."  Keene smiles thinly, and seems about to fire off a riposte' when Standingwater distracts him. "Mecca Pharmecuticals? How much is known about the place?"  the black smoke finally dissipates as the personal ceremony ends . Cally looks up.. "I told you.. Create an endangered animal, release and imprint it to the building location of Hyperion.. the Red tape of trying to move said animal will give us months to move the Node."  Standingwater facepalms. "An endangered animal suddenly appears in the middle of a city?"  Keene says nothing, looking briefly to Cally, then back to Standingwater. "I've never even heard of this Mecca place before just now. Has someone been keeping a file?"  "Thomas did,"Alex comments as he takes a seat on the ground.  Cally looks to Standingwater.,., "It happens quite often actually.. in the United states..  Keene moves his attention to Cally for a moment. "What my colleagues here are trying to say, I think, is that the sudden appearance of an endangered species in an area which has not ever been known to have such would appear disingenuous. All that would occur would be the transport of the animal to a more suitable habitat."  Standingwater takes out a small leather pouch and loads his pipe with the contents. "I couldn't shit an endangered species anyway. Well, maybe an endangered plant or a rare insect. Nothing anybody is going to care about."  Cally says, "the animal would be moved.. yes.. but after the Environmental groups fought for the creature to remain there.. would Hyperion suspect we are behind it? Maybe. In any case, there would be a lawsuit, Hyperion would have to go to court before they could remove the animal . And as such Publicity for them would be turned.. It is subtle, and it will give us time to move this node.. Why are you even against it? And if they do move the animal, it will be to a refuge where it's addition would help restock the species."  "I would still be interested in what would be a worthwhile battle,"Alex comments as he leans back on his elbows.  Keene waits for Cally to finish, includes an adequate pause, then speaks again. "No. This gambit would fail. This is my reasoning." He puffs on his cigarette, giving a `one moment' look to Alex. "It would become clear by a cursory examination of the past data that the endangered species would not belong there. First, there is the matter of it being in the center of a massive metropolitan area that has been throughly sanitized of most wildlife. Further, the area would not be suitable to support most living things considering its surroundings. Any environmental group that discovered an endangered species of any kind in that area would probably encourage moving it rather than allowing it to be exposed to the negative environment of the city."  "There was a rare and endangered frog found in the urban waste land that was turned into the Sydney Olympic site,"Alex comments idly,"Tied up construction of the Olympic village for months...."  Cally says, "fine.. whatever.. you boys continue to nay say.. I had my discussion of it.. you guys figure out how to do it , but as for me, I'll back out of this endeavor. If you ever decide to come up with a unified plan I'll frankly be shocked.. you boys asked for suggestions, I gave one, and rather then consider the possibility, you have condemned it in less then a minute. fine. Do what you want.. I now wash my hands of it.. Besides, I've more important things to worry about."  Keene finishes his cigarette. "It will fail. Feel free to try it, of course. I have outlined my issues with the idea in a civil and professional manner." He looks back up to Cally. "Have a nice day."  Cally looks to Alex and gives a small smile.. At least one person has considered her suggestion.. But for the others, well.. she's tired of the my plan is better then your plan type attitude that seems prevalent..  "You were asking a question," says Keene, settling back on his rock and looking to Alex. "about winnable battles. Let me first tell you what is not a winnable battle: a head-to-head fight against a Technocratic corporation when you don't have a game plan outside of trying to play a game of `keep away'. Perhaps I just wasn't here when this all started, but were any of you going to clean the Node and do something with it before Hyperion came along? I heard it was corrupt for the longest time."  Standingwater lights up his pipe. It sure isn't tobacco in that thing. "I was merely hoping for a delay while the node was moved or destroyed. The destruction of Mecca would also be welcome, but I see no one is up for that either. I'd better start packing my bags. People who sit on their hands will get me killed."  "Abel was going to cleanse it, from what I have heard," Alex comments with a shrug,"I even erased all of the permits that Hyperion had for the site, but no one did anything to follow up on what I did."  "And I'm sure that wasn't suspicous in the least, nor not remedied during the course of a day by producing the original copies," says Keene. He fishes out a second cigarette from his pocket, not lighting it up just yet. "Trying to fight `the system' by doing what amounts to spiking the punch doesn't do anything but piss the Technocrats off and damage Sleepers. This is why I don't go for the head-to-head thing." Keene waves the cigarette through the fire, bringing it back afterward to take a puff. "That and I know when I'm sorely outmatched. You need a large structure behind you to even nick their paint."  "Actually it took them a /bit/ more than a day,"Alex informs with a making a pinching action with his fingers,"I rezoned the land for non-commercial and industrial use. They had to get in and fit that too... And as for working in the system, that is what Virtual Adepts do best. I mean, we have a cabal working in the NSA after all..."  Cally ahems.. "excuse me.. I have a question. Other then the basic premise that the technos own this land and it has a Node, mind telling me why I should bother trying to offer services in getting it? I mean.. honestly.. I've been here a little over a year. I had problems I asked for assistance, and only in one or two situations was help ever offered.. Only once was assistance given. I offered my services other times.. Many times my offers were placed aside.. you know what? don't even bother with Hyperion. Because if apathy can turn a person like me who used to have ideas and drives for this chantry to not give a shit, then those of us who stopped giving a shit a long time ago won't bother helping.. Frankly there is no respect. no interest.. no reason to help another member.. In short we have nothing in common, and no common goal. So we are going to lose here.. Fine.. As for me, so long as it does not interrupt my research, I personally don't care anymore.. I'll throw money and stuff for the chantry like a good little Traddie but frankly.. my heart is not in fighting a losing war.  "I'm very impressed," says Keene to Alex. "But all the same, all it did was cause them some moderate annoyance. Granted, I imagine it was very funny at the time." He puffs on his cigarette, pausing to let Cally speak. He seems to have no comment, since he continues with his thought to Alex. "I deal with individuals rather than trying to challenge the machine directly. The Invisible College tries to stir the people of this world out of intellectual complacency by various means. You may have called them `stunts' or `pranks'. Creating an altered state of consciousness in a person, even for a short time, nurtures the spark within all people to become more than robots. Waking people up, to me, is a much more productive venture than trying to stop a heavily militarized hive-mind driven magic-powered conspiracy with what amounts to a spoon and the Crazy Eye."  Standingwater sighs, "I apologize for wasting your time, Mr. Keene. I just thought this was something the Invisible College would get into. Even just destroying Mecca would help raise spirits around here. Clearly I miscalculated the ability of the College." This said, he falls silent and just puffs away at his pipe.  Alex nods to Cally, shruggin a little as he does. "That is why I have been saying that we need to sit down and decide what it is that the Chantry is doing here. Direction. Goals. A mission statement."  Alex glances over to Keene,"But this heavily militarized hive-mind is working in opposition to what you are trying to do," he pause a moment,"And they are pouring more effort and resources into it than you have to expend."  Keene smokes. "Perhaps," he says. "But that's how it's been for a thousand years. And here we are." He looks at Standingwater for a moment at his statement, but has no immediate reply.  "The Ironteeth have only been working against us... the Traditions for a couple hundred years,"Alex states,"And in that time they have continuously been pushing the Traditions back. Sooner or later the Traditions are going to be pushed up against the wall and crushed, if they do not do something about it."  Cally sighs.. "Alex.. you were not here.. no wait maybe you were.. I tried to shock the group into trying to get into purpose.. I've received nothing but flak.. when I tried to assume the mantle of Leadership,. once I saw no one here bothered. What I got instead was protests and complaints I was infringing on their rights. Jonah came in. He did the same trick yet he was accepted as the leader. Yet tell me. Has anything changed? Has any groups worked? I've gotten some things done with my group, but as a Cabal it's not working. Mr. Keene here is a perfect example of my statement. I suggested an idea, a way to fight the Technocracy, not from the front but from the flank. I listened to what you guys wanted. Time at least to set up the moving of the Node.. Yet only Alex here even considered the idea.. the idea instead was quashed in less then a minute.. the Invisible College? Yeah they are active.. but they are without direction, punks flaunting their power, answering to no one but themselves and no one willing to reign them in.  "You mean this isn't crushed?" asks Keene. "We're sitting on Mars. I imagine we'll have to invest in parkas and hang on Pluto soon enough." He puffs on his cigarette. "Tell you what. I really don't have any ideas about how to reverse what seems to be the consensus of the human cattle out there, but I'll listen to suggestions." He looks to Cally at her comment and smiles benignly. "Such words from one of your lofty station could only be complimentary."  "I was here,"Alex informs Cally,"And your problem was that you tried to take control of the Chantry in place of a departing /elected/ leader. You were viewed as a usurper."  Standingwater just keeps puffing away. Soon his eyes aren't looking at anything within a thousand miles of here. He's not much fun now.  Cally says, "yeah well.. that was a mistake in that the guy who made Dyne Abel and myself his inner circle never bothered to make that public to the Chantry.. Had he done that that would have been worlds easier for explanation.. I wasn;t trying to take over or be an usurper.. merely trying to keep the damn chantry together until someone would take over in a democratic way.. And Keene? Don't patronize allright? I really don't want to hear it.. I spoke my peace.. It may not be true, to you, but to me it is truth.. Quite frankly.. the problem here is no one has any respect for another.. what we have done is degenerated back to the days of the creation of the Order of Reason. you know how we won back then? Because the Traditions, or what will be the Traditions were too busy lording over their own power patting themselves on the back saying how greats they are and never bothered to look out from their castle to see times a changing.. Well.. 700 years later, our Traditions has again found ourselves in that comfortable hole.. quibbling and greedily grabbing for their piece of the rock, without trying to organize and present a unified front. you want Hyperion gone? fine.. you stop trying to work with the Invisible College Mr. Keene, and work on trying to integrate them into the Traditions with the rest of us. you stop pooh poohing ideas that are not your own and listen to other suggestions. the endangered animal thing? Maybe it was not a great idea. I'll admit to that. but it could be a stepping stone TO an idea that can work if you and others took the time to examine it. build on it and see how it or something like it could be used."  Alex looks to Keene,"You yourself have said that what you are doing is just how things have always been. But they have not had any effect in countering the efforts of the Ironteeth. So maybe we need to do something different..."  Keene maintains his peaceful, probably chemically assisted expression. Cally goes on at great length, and he doesn't break character at all. He does pause to smoke about halfway through, but still seems to be paying vague attention to the surroundings. "Duly noted," is his reply to Cally when she concludes her lengthy monologue. Then he moves his attention back to Alex. "As I said. I'll at least let anybody who has an idea present it before I critique it. I'll listen to anything; I don't buy into much."  Cally looks at Jamaia.. "Jamaia.. Can I ask you something?  Standingwater manages to force his gaze back to somewhere within the same universe as the rest of the group. "Ask. I can't promise a good answer."  "Well, the whole point to fighting the construction of the Hyperion Building is to keep the Ironteeth from getting a stronger foothold in the city,"Alex comments with a faint shrug,"/If/ we can do that then maybe your effort, just /might/, have some sort of effect over the people of the city."  "Why is that a concern?" asks Keene. "I have no delusions of grandeur. I don't /want/ to run the world. I'm happy if I can open a few eyes a year. Even a handful of people who don't blindly follow authority and stop to think occasionally improves the quality of human civilization considerably. I work on the micro level -- the macro level is for people who think they *actually* know better."  Cally sighs softly.. "Jamaia.. Playing Devil's advocate.. how would a endangered creature, discovered during construction be reacted to? What would be the outcome, and most importantly how long would there be a delay in construction?  "Because given enough time and apathy on your part, the few people who's eyes you open will be back to blindly follow authority because they are overwhelmed by all of the people that the Ironteeth take over," Alex states rather pointedly,"You think that the Ironteeth as going to just let a few people slip through the cracks?... They want /everything/...."  Keene smokes. "And what do we offer in return? Isn't this all just one large power struggle with both sides having ambiguous moral authority?"  "Well, in this Paradigm War; the Traditions are trying for a paradigm that would still have room for the Technomancers way of... 'life'," Alex states sitting up and crossing his legs,"The Ironteeth have only one way how things should work."  "Interesting," says Keene. "So it is assumed that a global paradigm could be maintained that could encapsulate several wildly divergent paradigms, as well as the present Technocratic establishment?"  Cally glances at Keene and Alex to show she is at least half listening while she politely awaits Jamaia's answer..  Standingwater taps his pipe out into the fire and puts it away. "We'd get a week. Tops. The environment around here is thoroughly cataloged. There is a refuge for nearly every endangered species out there. The only delay would be in identifying the creature and flying in a specialist to pack it up and move it to a refuge."  "I said a Technomancers way of 'life'," Alex clarifies,"Not the authoritive Technocratic establishment." "Did not happen that way in Sydney, only nine years ago,"Alex comments in response to Standingwaters statement.  Cally nods.. "allright a week.. Tell me.. what sort of Environmental impact groups are there here in Canada who would oppose such a move?  Keene gestures broadly. "Of course. That paradigm would be part of this patchwork quilt of paradigms under this mindset." He puffs on his cigarette. "Do you believe that we, as the Nine Traditions, would be able to handle power over the world on that scale without resorting to the tactics the Technocracy has used?"  "How said that we would have power over the world?..." Alex queries,"We would only have to be caretakers. Maintain the status quo."  "Hm," says Keene. "That sounds terribly familiar, doesn't it."  "No... Actually it does not,"Alex states simply as he rests his elbows on his knees.  Standingwater stands and gathers up his gear. Pack. Bow. Good to go. "Your guess is as good as mine. I haven't been in the ecology business in a very long time. Besides, where do you plan to come up with these critters? How are you going to make it look like they've been there for years rather than just being dumped there?"  Keene smokes. "Tell me why not."  "Maintaining a status quo of a diverse paradigm is /nothing/ like what the Ironteeth as trying to do,"Alex explains with wave of his hand,"They have one way of thinking and doing things. And if you do not fit in with their way then they get rid of you."  Keene finishes his cigarette. "And can we really be so sure we wouldn't start using those methods? Without the active threat of the Technocracy, the cohesiveness of the Nine falls apart. The only reason we even work together is out of a desire to survive. Once our individual Traditions started to regain power ... well, I know how the Order is, and I've read my history books."  "Well, I would rather try to do it and fail than just give up and let the Ironteeth win," Alex states with a dark scowl.  Keene flicks his dead cigarette into the fire. "I think they won a long time ago, by the way Paradox seems to work and the existence of television and modern medicine. All that's left are some fragments on the periphery they don't seem to be able to get rid of, but the wagons are pretty much circled." He leans back. "So, as I said earlier, what makes us intrinsically better? Our moral character is not without question. Our cohesiveness is reactive rather than cooperative, ultimately illusory. Further, the concept that the sheep would want to actually want to /work/ -- and that's what magic is, as it requires actual effort and competence -- is counter to everything I know about human nature." He idly picks a piece of dirt out from one of his fingernails. "Thus, I see an impasse on the macroparadigmatic level."  Cally shrugs.. "actually.. I don't know.. I have no experience in the Life spheres.. To be honest, I'm not even sure what sort of endangered creature there is here. Or rather was here..I do know that in the US sanctuaries have been lobbied for Many times successfully. I also know that many companies when exposed to the presence of a undiscovered creature at least in the US, had the property dispute tied up for years. I do know maybe.. the Technos may suspect we did something.. then again, it may not matter. I can promise you this: If you can create an endangered animal, I will help you with researching the perfect one.. for our plans.. " she looks steadily at Jamaia, and then at Alex and Keene. "I can't promise the idea will succeed. But maybe.. it can buy us some extra time.. Particularly if we had others try to stir up media and the public about preserving this animal's habitat. the plan is subtle.. and it may have the advantage to darken the Technocracy, perhaps loosen a few more from the Techno's grip.. My question then is, what would we have to lose? what sort of risks would there be? the animal we create, even if moved would still live and help repopulate a species that would almost be wiped out.. We could get an injunction to freeze Hyperion's efforts.. and the Technocracy would not be able to attack us directly thus giving us a chance to win without looking like the criminals here.  Alex shakes his head and stands,"Whatever..." he says and turns to head for the keep.  Standingwater slings the pack over his shoulder and heads off to the lake. "Sorry. Can't help you. Creating endangered creatures is beyond my skill."  "Have a nice day," Keene says pleasantly to Alex.  Alex begins down the hill, ascending the other. He opens the doors to the structure, heading inside. Alex has left.  Keene stares into the fire for a while after Alex leaves, speaking only after he's out of sight. "I can't do much for you, even if I particularly felt inclined to. Nobody I know can make living animals either."  Standingwater heads down the hill and follows the stream toward the lake in the distance. Standingwater has left.  Cally sighs.,. and shakes her head.,. and looks at Keene. "and you have now witnessed why we are going to lose. Because you know the damning thing? One of us can do it.. Or even know someone who can do it.. but it's easier to give up. wash their hands.. so.. I'm going to join the growing mass. wash my hands of it.. If you have any idea and can pull it off. Well give me a call.. Otherwise, I said my piece and tried my best. Sorry it wasn't good enough.  "It's alright," Keene says, looking into the fire. "You have a nice evening, now."  Alex wanders out of Novus Valnastium in the distance, slowly closing ground until he has arrived in the heart of the fields. Alex has arrived.  Several minutes later, Alex exits the keep and makes his way across the rolling hills to the cavern. He pauses a moment to look back at Novus and then turns to head into the cavern. Alex heads down the hill and up the other, disappearing into the cavern's darkness. Alex has left.  Keene sits in front of the fire for a while. Then, after kicking some dirt onto it to put it out, he steps off and heads back towards the real world. Such as it is. "Ta."  Cally nods and sighs as SHE STANDS THERE . seems SHE HAS SOME DECISIONS TO MAKE.  >> Keene leaves. >> Alex leaves a note.  ============================= Mage - Traditions ============================= Message: 46/93                     Posted        Author Good Luck                          2003 May 22   Alex -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    Tradition Members, I have decided that the Traditions are a lost cause.

      //.etro: It is 8:05 pm, late evening, on Thursday the 01. day of January, 2009. . Downtown - Yonge and St. Clair(#113RJ)       This intersection is covered with streetcar tracks, running west and south. Nearby is Rosedale, one of the nicest residential neighbourhoods in central Toronto. There are two movie theatres within the same block, the Hollywood, and the Hyland. The Royal Bank takes up one corner, and on the other side of St. Clair is a popular little McDonalds that is connected to the subway station. Just north of St. Clair is a commercial development housing Bruno's Fine Foods and several small restaurants including Bregman's, a great breakfast place. The rest of the area is mostly made up of office buildings and various stores. Like most of Yonge's intersections, this one is usually busy with traffic and pedestrians.  Contents: Griswold Penny  Griswold arrives from the south. Griswold has arrived. Griswold step up from the south, a slight smile on his face as he walks north.  Curbed with the rest of yesterday's celebrations, Penny stands shivering. With a coat slung over her arm, she tries to light the end of a cigarette with a cheap plastic lighter to no avail. From the continued repetition, it sounds like the flints long gone.           An extremely handsome European man stands before you, at about 6' 11" and with nearly 330lbs of muscle. Naturally straight blonde hair flows down his head like a waterfall, parted at the side by pointed, almost elf-like ears. This man's deep sky-blue eyes look out at you from a slightly narrow face with strong bones. Some people, gazing upon this proud, dignified man might feel an inexplicable sense of unease creep over them.           His brown leather trench coat spreads evenly over his broad shoulders and muscle-bound back and flows down past his knees, nearly hiding simple faded-brown pants, a bright new arctic blue polo shirt and faded black combat boots. This ensemble comes together to show a life of living it rough.               Griswold read your description. There are no +view's in your current location. +Viewable items on Griswold:  EERIE  Griswold sufferes from the flaw Eerie Presence.  Griswold's eyes are pretty much trained on the north, and there is a bounce in his step. As he nears you the sound of the cigarette lighter becomes apparent and he looks to you. After a moment he picks up that you are shivering as asks, "Are you ok?" As his large frame would suggest, his voice has a low pitch.  Penny looks up, a faint crease where a smile would be on anyone else. "Need a light," the stick bouncing around her words. But because she's cold-thus-perceptive she takes it out of her mouth, the better to vocalise. Two fingers form a v around it and she gestures a circle with it at you "got one?"  Griswold shakes his head. "Nah, sorry. I don't." he says, before looking around. "It's a little cold out, are you off to somewhere?"  "Waiting for some-" it takes her a minute but once it settles in, once she gets a good look at you, Penny begins to take a step in the opposite direction. Her fingers curl around the cigarette, folded and probably bent into the palm of her hand "-one. Uh.." her coat begins to unfold with less grace in gravity than most things and she makes those little required adjustments to keep it off the ground.  Griswold seems oblivious to your reaction, and nods as he looks around. "Hope they come soon, and get you inside. You look cold." he says innocently, looking back to you and smiling warmly in return to your forced smile.  One step. Then another until there's a better distance. The traffic of other groups of people seem to be unconciously giving wide berth to this immediate square of pavement. Wind blew the trash just then or the light changed and those people have opted for the other way afterall - and on occassion one or two still pitched onward look back over their shoulders. They look at Penny because she dropped a pile of tobacco on the ground and hasn't moved, they look because she can't stop staring at you, they look because she hasn't covered up as they have to shield herself from the weather and her nose is running and her eyemakeup is smeared.  Griswold tilts his head to the side and looks genuinely concerned. "What's wrong?" he asks in a worried tone, stepping forward a little. The empty circle that the pedestrians unconciously leave around the large man follows him, he does not seem to notice this among other things.  She looks down the street again, briefly. It could be interpretted as a flinch; it is not a genuine gesture. The metal and glass tied in her hair make a faint clinking like china touching crystal; gradual clatter.  Dusting the mess of brown flakes off her hand, Penny protests "I'm /fine/. What's your problem? I just wanted a light." Pinched nerve in her voice.  Griswold recoils a step at this change of tone, his eyes widen and he automatically holds up his large hand with palms facing you. "Sorry, you just looked cold..." he says, looking over you once more.  Fierce for a moment, matching the timbre of the traffic sounds; loud horns streaming by. The noise and attitude pass almost at once and Penny lifts her shoulder, turns her head to the side cutting off direct eye-contact; a gesture that removes her profile. Provides wind-block so she can work on the lighter again and a cigarette pulled from the depths of a hidden pocket.  Griswold waits for a moment more, just standing and looking at Penny with wide eyes. After a moment he tentively says, "Ok, well. Have a good night." He begins to walk towards the north. "And get inside, before you freeze."  Penny can not run away, not in those heels but she has this innate sense; knows when an opportunity to take off has come along. Time has passed - this mystery person hasn't shown, if there was infact anyone at all. She does not hail a cab, preoccupied with the cigarette, the lighter, managing the coat.  Penny can not run away but you get the feeling she would if she could.  Griswold shakes his head softly and walkes off to the north, he can be seen head and shoulders above most of the pedestrians.  Relief comes in Mustang form with a raspy engine and a paint job that's seen better days. The worn car rounds the corner a few digits over the speed limit. It's tinted windows conceal the driver, but it appears picking up Penny's on the agenda. It's rumbles to a halt a few feet away from her, in double parked mode. The passenger's side door is punched open, and weed smoke rolls out from it's innards like Redman were at the wheel. A voice from inside, "Oi."  This is the thing about walking in heels most people don't understand; the reason women cross one foot in front of the other is that the angle of descent keeps them from toppling over. It isn't because the jaunt puts a particular accent on the hip, it isn't even necessarily appealing, this walk of Penny's, this is about functioning in near-immobile conditions.  And once given pause, the body tips toward the car. She steps off the sidewalk, off the curb keeping her balance with a light touch on the no-parking 6pm-7am sign toward the Mustang. Bending from the waist, she squints into the haze. "Oi," and gestures hang-loose with her hand, two fingers with the cigarette pointing left.  Griswold walks north to Eglinton. Griswold has left.  "Inski." Chase looks back to the road, hands at 10 and 3 o'clock like a good driving student. The engine revs, the man's expectant. Eyes to the rear-view. Always checking his back. "Less go fer a ride, eh?" Always checking his back. So much so, he hasn't had time to spot Penny's new duds. Until.   " Shite chica, whatchoo... Makin' a few extra bucks on the side?"  Ducking into the car things hitch; her skirt, her breath, her heel in the grate. All of these things quickened in the confines of the leather-trim and tinted glass.  "Yes."  Her fingers press gently into the seam between seatbelt buckle and gearshift; a stitch in her side, sinking lower into the bucket, legs taking up a mile beneath the dash. It's the heels. Still looking dead ahead, she offers nothing more but asks "Light?" untucking the cigarette from behind that ear.  But Chase is still drinking it in. His eyes say stuff, but he just turns back to the task at hand. Driving and lighting. A zippo sits kingly above a pile of ashes in the ashtray, his car lighter being occupied by a wide band-width police scanner. It's pointed to as the car pulls out into the scant traffic.   "'M not even gonna ask."  Penny exhales, sighs really, like this is work or this isn't fun or there's something Chase is missing. Fingernails tip into the ashes and just the smooth click and sudden butane-smell seem to take the edges off her. Soft crackle at the far end, she keeps the lighter open and ducks it somewhere down and to the left.  "It's not like that," an explanation without saying too much "it's a thing I do," emphasis on 'thing' as she drags "just for the new year. Jesse can explain it better than I can" and exhales through her nose.  "Ah." It's like Chase stops her from continuing, even though her explanation is final. Into the flow they pull, the Mustang takes no quarter amongst it's peers. A right turn here, a left turn there, and straight as piss for a mile or to as some vintage Velvet Underground starts playing. The stuff before that dumb German chic jumped aboard.   "You niggers ain't set up yet, eh? 'S what Jesse said..."  True, you don't need to hear it whatever it is. Another time. "God's got a say about that this month. s'all involved on account'a Pobble's meddlin'an' his fingers in all o" she cuts herself off, realizing with intermitent clarity that she does sound like a crazy person. The business of closing her eyes seems an easier thing, so Penny slumps over to the right putting her forehead to the cold glass of the window.   "Make any resolutions?" voiced with a kind of disinterested twinge; it's the most mundane thing she can think of to say, the most normal because normal is what's necessary for long drives out into nowhere. Then when its quiet, quiet in the relative sense; when there aren't sirens chasing down some other fool, aren't parties being passed by, aren't flashing neon adverts - when it's dark she sings along "Like a bird, you know she would fly, what can you do" can carry a tune but it's creepy "you see her walkin' on down the street" half mumbling into the elbow repropped on "look at all your friends that she's gonna meet.. you better hit her.."  "Eh..." It's not a yes or no, Chase makes a left. The whole first part, about god and Pobble, that get's a look. But it's fleeting. Fucker knows better than to ask by now. "I suppose. Well, mebbe. Mebbe I'll try and get laid this year. 'Aven't done that in a while. Mighta forgot how ta do it, though." The idea builds, Chase is giving in to it. The stubble on his chin makes some noise as it's scratched in nervous energy. Some nods, perhaps he just made that one on the spot. "Yeah, ta get laid. That's it." A moment's pause and he spots the girl riding shotgun. "Looks like that was yers to, eh?" A grin back to Penny, hooker heels and all.  Tranced out in between lyrics she says something that sounds like "to be loved" or "to be most beloved" mumbling about the season, the aeon, the darkness and desire passing. Like a scratched cd jumps around in the track, the groove of conversation is lost. A jumble of mixed up words and thoughts, burning down the cigarette is the only aide - each drag breaking up what she says so that each phrase makes sense. "He said there's no such thing as sin," repositioning herself to see and speak to you, uncoiled, the stutter of metal and glass when she turns her head "that's it's all apostelic, mysogynist bullshit." As she leans, there's a sound, like sticky tape pulling apart from the skin.  Eyes that were expecting a quip or joke in return, wait like a stood up prom date. Chase just watches her for a few silent beats after she speaks, turning back to the street without the prize of a proper reply.   "Yeah." The void is filling with some prompting conversational hooks whilst stopped at a red light. "Weed's in the glove, chica. Blow's under the seat, 'n I gotta few whip-its left from my New Year's blowout."  Penny is innocent, blameless. "Pull over, hey? M'gonna.." she half-tilts her head meaning she's gonna one or the other or something else entirely. "Where we goin'anyway?"  And it strikes you just then that she is void of that particular pique you're feeling... in a lights-are-on but no-one's-home kind of way. It starts to make twisted sense as she digs around in the folds of the coat and pulls out a small leather case - same case you saw her with last week. "Fix with me?" Unbuttoning, you can see it holds just the right things, just the right size - spoon, needle, the smell of antiseptic assaults and tucked into the other side are things both wet and dry.  A moment's consideration. "Why the fuck not." Sure, twist his arm why doncha. And so Chase pulls over, and they fix, and the rest is a narcotic blur.

      Downtown - Jarvis and Dundas(#131RJ)       Empty lots and undeveloped plots of useless land fill this intersection. Old, largely-abandoned factories are set up along the streetside. Development here ceased long ago, apparently. Two major homeless shelters operate in this area, given its rather cheap real-estate value. The area is mostly populated by homeless people, junkies and whores, though the occasional employee of the few operating companies in this area might be seen driving through... generally rapidly.  Contents: Jesse Chase Billboard In Front of the Vacant Lot   Almost sunrise, some people don't sleep. Like the never ending patrol across the street in front of the private lot. Or, snug between two smaller imports, a black Mustang is nestled in a space barely big enough to hold it's frame. The windows tinted, the doors closed, the only hint someone's in there is the smell of smoke in passing. Though you'd hafta be near the worn vehicle to pick that up. And even closer to finger it as weed.   With the vague shuffle of a junkie or the ponderous attention to balance of a drunk, Jesse turns the corner and drifts up the quiet pavement. He is hunched, his right hand held before his eyes, and whatever is in it, he's following it, his slow and careful steps winding around manholes, pausing at crumpled newspapers, and veering towards the detritus in the gutters. Then, motionless - he stops and looks up, turns one way, then the other, then stares at the dark car before him. Alone, as it were, on the morning sidewalk, accompanied only by everyman's partner Jimmy Beam, visible when the left hand brings the fifth from under his coat for a surreptitious sip.  If she had eyes, she'd look back up. But it so happens the Mustang's lights are off, and the engine's long cold. Still, there's stirring inside, and a squeak which can be attributed to the window roller. Down the tinted glass slides, allowing a narcotic fog bank to drift into the pre-dawn air. "Oi." From dark inside, a figure's illuminated by a strange blue glow. One usually associated with Pilipino kids who trick out their Acuras with neon and play streetfighter at the local liquor store. "That whiskey?"   A nod, and Jesse looks at the ersatz pendulum in his right hand - a glass eye in a knotted condom - and shakes it. Flaccid. He looks at the car again, shrugs, and tosses the rubber into a storm drain. He offers the bottle to the window.  "Bourbon. Cheers."  It's a trade then. Chase's callused hand offers up a mostly smoked blunt through the opening, before he leans back into the relative cover to swig. Lip smacking sounds, he even wipes the bottle. "Tits." He approves and sticks his head out proper to be identified as such. Lazy eyes follow the makeshift wondrous item, then back up to Jesse. Though his square chin is sure to recoil into the depths of his ride when the first dawn of the new year threatens to rise over some buildings. "Inside?" A suggestion, and look back across to the vacant lot.   A_Raven flies high above the city streets, heading north.  Jesse nods, cupping the last of the blunt to his lips to guard the red glow from whoever might be watching. He skirts around the car, swings the passenger door open, and stares at the sky in disbelief.  "Fuck me." He coughs out smoke. "That's a big fucking pigeon."  With that, he folds himself into the car and slams the door shut.  A_Raven caws as it flies over.  Again with the squeaks, they belong to the car's window handle. The black Mustang sports equally dark glass to conceal her contents. And their number is two now.   Inside the car, Chase allows Jesse in and hands him back the bottle. Tit for tat, and the blunt's plucked back. The thick man's gaze too focused on the lot to notice the creatures native to this hood. "Missed 'r. What the shit's new, amigo?" It's asked without looking, Chase turns back to watch the patrol as the hotbox continues. The blue glow, now obviously emanating from a stacked stereo system and digital nitrate regulator.   "Fuck all." Jesse shrugs amicably, accepting the bottle once more. "Ta." He turns his gaze across the street, as though by staring he might unlock the secrets of the construction yard. "Been away, came back, far as I can tell everyone's still dumb, we're still in a hotel room, and now apparently dumb has been going to meetings, 'cause we're supposed to be organized."   Stinkface. "I've 'ad it with that lot." Chase seems cocksure, "Fuckin' central." Here he vents, and turns back to Jesse. The blunt idly smokes by it's self. "They want me ta help 'm watch their gay ass altered states." Pffffts. A big hit and raspy voice as he speaks in the safety of his aged Mustang. "Like I'm a babysitter 'r some shite, ahhh chingato."   Jesse shrugs. "We gave 'em Peachy to keep them quiet. He just churns out press realeases an' says shit with that smile of his, so the rest of us can do, uh..." He laughs. "Whatever it is we do. Had some logistical problems with the rest of our stuff arriving. Weren't planning to stay in the Holiday Inn all year."  "Yeah well. General Paris... He says do, 'n I do." There's more smoking, Chase checks the lot every 8 seconds. "Least you cabrones gotta face man. 'I walk in there and take their shite meself. Hell, gimme fuckin' Timor anyday. I'll take a sea a' gooks 'n bungy traps."  "Ask me, you should break out the black mask and pipe, man." Jesse tilts his hat forwards, leaning back in his seat with a grin. "Pull some of that old ELZN magic. Really shake shit up."   "'S not 'red' in this city yet. There's time for prep work." Chase sniffles, ashing the blunt and nudging Jesse with it as it's near dead. "I go into grease paint and go mode, there's no turnin' back. 'N I got shite ta do still."   Jesse nods, holding the blunt with his fingernails, a scant half-inch from his pursed lips as he inhales. "Way I see it," he pauses to blow smoke at the windshield. "Way I see it, we're working backwards. Stopping construction's not gonna do anything. Fucking with them isn't the same as getting anything done. People around here, I don't really see them doing anything. Aside from the martyr me jesus kids, and I try not to think about what they're doing too much."   "Japutos." Chase curses, rubbing his nose absently. With a long exhale he settles back into the fake lamb furred seat. Still eyeing the lot from a lazy slump. "Ya know, if i had the resources, shit would be churnin' in this fucker already. I woulda had hot fuckin' blow on the streets. I'm talkin' day-stopping shit, opening people up right on the damn sidewalk to spiritual convulsions. 'Stead? Instead I get to guard the 5th dimension from ghosts... Paris better make his mind up soon, I can't take this anymore."    Jesse laughs and offers the last shreds of blunt back, then takes a pull of the bourbon. "Hell. I don't even know who Paris is. Peaches takes care of all that, I just gotta keep my mouth shut and quit screaming at the Criamon chick." He shakes his head no. "Hate to say this, but if anything goes down, I trust the people at my back, you know? Those joeboos in the backyard, I wouldn't trust them to know which end of the gun to point, let alone not to hit me on accident."   "Paris is my man back in Guam. He's tactical coordinator of the 12th signal brigade, After-Math central." Chase looks down to the dead brown scrap that was the blunt and gnashes it into his ashtray. "He's the only one I trust with me life in this damn shitglobe. All them other cabrones, well, i'm just here 'cause el General says so. Till he figures out strategical advantage in Toronto theatre, i'm supposed ta play nice and forget that they relocated me Chile." A red eyed glance at the blue display, and the sun rising tell him it's time. "But all that, that's another story. Time ta beat rocks, hombre." A hand's offered over, callused and worn. "Via con dios."  Jesse nods, opening the door, and tucking the bottle between the seats. "Watch your six, caballero." He grins and tugs the brim of his hat, then slides out of the car and slams the door shut, stretching and yawning widely. "'sup, Penn?" Jesse calls over. "You headin' back holidayside?"  *Vroom and Rumble* Off the car goes. Go eat Chase, go eat. Chase escapes OOC. Chase has left.  There's a long dark car rolling through this part of town. Maybe one of those pharmaceuticals had a til-dawn party. Day-running lights? or just lights still on could place that car in a variety of situations. But it stops up on the corner and Penny gets out.  Doubletake. Penny?  Or an evil twin; dark hair, dark man's coat pulled out behind her. The door clicks shut behind her, a heavy and well-machined sound. A wealthy of oil and engineering. Such a simple thing. And as she moves out between garbage cans and piles of recyclables, the car rolls after her, shadowing. The window goes down and a gloved hand extends a card stacked on a characteristic fold of money.  "Penny?" He repeats himself. "You heading hoidayside or what?  Abel appears from the north. Abel has arrived. Abel comes walking down the street, hands dug deep into his pockets to keep warm.  The hand from the car does not waver or shake the offering but does seem strained. It is not a long or especially deft arm. Positioning tells us this person is riding shotgun, backwards. That it's low on the edge of the window suggests 'asian.' Maybe it's the cut of the glove. Penny takes the two steps back to the glove, takes the cash and card. The car peels out as she pockets the fold into a jacket clearly not hers.  "You're back." Stunned, Penny has to squint out of the sun just to get a better look. Like the hat and profile isn't enough to convince her what she's seeing is real. "I need a drink. Don't think that hotel bar's still open."  Abel          You see a good-looking young man in his late teens, maybe 19 or 20. He stands about 5'10". His one time straight, California-blonde hair has been cut and faded to a more normal blonde color and has curled a little now that it is a natural color again. His eyes are grey and have an old, far-away, feel to them, as if he's seen much more than any teen his age should or could have. He has a winning, trust-inspiring smile that frequently eases through his features and a lot of natural presence and charisma. He speaks with a California accent, almost the stereotypical surfer type, unless he's in a formal situation when he obviously tries to control it. He's on the skinny side and doesn't look very strong but is lean and moves easily on sure feet.            Currently he is wearing a pair of clean khacki cargo pants and a black long sleeve T-shirt. Over the black he is wearing a grey, short-sleeve T-shirt with a picture of a penny on the back of it. He wears brown, mid-cut hiking shoes. Around his neck, on a thin chain, hangs a small, stylized sun symbol.            Over all this he is wearing a warm-looking brown great-coat to ward against the Toronto winter cold.  Jesse points to the retreating car. "Left the bourbon with Chase." He shrugs, scratching at his sleeve. "Tats are still fresh. Itch like fuck. 'mgonna pass out. Wake me before new years, hey?"  //.etro: It is 08:45 am, mid-morning, on Wednesday the 31. day of December, 2008.   Abel stops in front of the Hyperion lot, looking at it with a bit of a frown.  You say, "Is that who.." Maybe it's the shoes, but she wobbles and puts her hand on Jesse's arm suddenly, catches herself. "Don't let him touch you with it," a not-whisper. "Don't go in the bathroom. He keeps it there."  Clearly Penny isn't going back to the hotel any time soon.  Jesse nods. "D'worry. Been pissing in Piggy's wheaties anyway." Jesse bares another yawn, tugs his coat closed, and shuffles towards the hotel once more. "Don't forget, kick me before the new year or else."  Abel turns from the lot to look across the Street at Mecca. He frowns at it as well. If he noticed the car episode or not is open to speculation. In this neighborhood deals going down out of cars are hardly out of the ordinary.  Jesse moves pretty fast for .. well for him. He's gone off the block and caught a cab back across town. Penny would do something similar except for her heels. They make the walking slow going, painful to watch her stick in the pavement cracks, narrowly missing sidewalk grates, shaking the odd piece of garbage from underfoot.  Abel read your description.  Penny(#6870PIOAC)           The refined sythesis of hard living and regular controlled substance abuse is as much a draw as it is obvious. The countenance is the portrait of the soul and the eyes mark its intentions. What is most clear is that Penny wants. Green eyes, sun-scorched dyed-black eyebrows obvious on the paler skin. Her mouth a red, ripe stain; a suggestion of violence.  Somewhere it was ordained that she have a sleekly dark skull, that she have this black hair; full on top and pared down at the sides. Buzzed into a V-shape at the nape. Slopes and curves festoon upward from both ears, shaved into the scalp like a tagger's signature, fine print. About half the hair on top has been threaded by silver wire and glass straws.  That dress is criminal; steals glances, fosters ungovernable thoughts - some more potent than others. A swathe of gunmetal silk, it drapes from shoulder to shoulder just across the neck and down to points just past the knee. Its back also mantled low into the small of the back is cut to focus on a tiny silver chain-and-pendulum and a design. Running up Penny's spine is a tattoo of shapes similar to those shaved into her hair. Same artist. Impossible heels finish the look, ankles in the bondage of iAbel nods to Penny if she comes near him, but out of politeness more than any thing else. He seems to be lost in his thoughts and his eyes havea slightly distant, unfocused look to them.  In this part of town, distant and disconnected are modus operandi. See there? No one's bothered to roust the homeless out of those corners, not even the light of day can stir them to wakeful and alert. It's this fog, this bone-chilling fog. It settles like a skein, crisscrossing awareness until things, people, are bumped into. Walking like this, half-senseless, Penny knocks into Abel's mirage.  Abel seems to anticipate Penny knocking into him and moves to catch her before she falls or snaps her ankles in those shoes she's wearing. His eyes refocus. "Are you alright Miss?" The coat falls open, red stains inside. Some bright, some brick. Another dress bundled inside it starts to slither out. She's fast, recoiling the pieces to her "I'm" weary, cold "sorry. I'm f-fu-fine" she chatters "It's these shoes." It isn't funny but she laughs in a way that makes you think it really is her shoes that're the problem.  Abel nods and looks down at the shoes. "How can you walk in those things at all? Like, This isn't a good neighborhood to not be able to move quickly in." His california accent is pretty noticeable right now. "And you sound cold."  "Friends," she nods at some vanishing point up the street. Whoever they were, they're gone now. Steadied and righted at your side, Penny touches on a moment of clarity "And you're here. You're here," indicating the lot's fence without pointing, but a nod of her head. Like that says everything.  Abel smiles a little. The chain around his neck and the symbol on it catching the light momentarily. "Friends? I Know Jesse a little. But I don't think we've met." He gestures to the lot with his head as well. "As far as 'here' goes, I'm working on the problem."  If it were any more obvious, it would've bit her. Penny goes 'ah' and collects herself on less unsteady ground. "What binds m.. " she starts but with a wince, her head canting to the side internalizing the rest of that phrase, bites it down the way drunks hold back the naseau "Penny. I'm Penny," left hand crossed to cover that stitch in her side, the coat concealing a better portion of the gesture. "Y'know Jes. That's good, look," with a renewed urgency "could you just hail me a cab maybe? I'm not.." not so good is what she means.  Abel nods. "Nice to meet you Penny. I'm Abel. And yeah. I can get you a cab." He looks up and down the street, making sure Penny doesn't fall over. "It takes an act of God to get one in this part of town to stop though." He grins a little. He says a small prayer under his breath as he looks up and down the street, then gestures at a cab passing through in a hurry. That it stops may be nothing short of Miraculous. It actually goes by, then seems to have a change of heart and turns around and comes back to the couple.  Hiro arrives from the south. Hiro has arrived.  New Years Eve. Nobody gives a second thought to another person just a little too full of festive cheer. It isn't anywhere near midnight. Nobody is supposed to have uncorked the champagne yet. Hiro must be a cracked-out loon. But there's plenty of those to go around, around these parts. Cracked out loons.                  "PEEEENNNAAAH!"  And, with that, Hiro appears from nowhere. And collides with Penny.  He appears to be attempting to grapple her in some kind of terrible bone-cracking bearhug.  The cab, naturally. That's where Hiro came from. That's why it backed up and got so close to Penny and Abel. Providence.  And Penny, in those heels.  The hapless mass that is Hiro is not something she shies away from but that look on her face, that mask of a halfsmile. That charicature of horrified and forgetful glee straps itself across her entire body in a posture of absolute agony when he gets a hold of her.  And she screams.  "PiggypiggypiggyNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO..god..god..god..god..oh..god."  Abel frowns and winces. "Carefull Hiro, She's hurt." He reaches around to make sure the three of them don't go over onto the ground.  Hiro read your description. Hiro Bad posture is to blame for Hiro's diminutive presence: with shoulders slumped and hands balled up in his pockets, he cruises closer to 5'6 than his modest 5'9. The polite might refer to him as 'big boned' or 'chubby': the fact remains, however, that he simply looks like a pig. Short, tousled black hair, a plain face that edges towards the porcine, and silent, placid brown eyes distorted to largeness by corrective lenses. His double-helix bears the tags of half a dozen southeast asian cultures, with a smattering of anglo-mutt thrown in on this side of the pacific.  In 1993, Rancid's release tour for their self-titled debut was met with a small riot in Des Moines, Iowa. The Wallgreens off of I-26 -- being the only business open at two in the morning -- was attacked by teenaged punk rockers. The pharmacy, in particular, suffered heavy damage and losses: an estimated street value of seven thousand dollars in valium, muscle relaxants, and ritalin. The on-duty pharmacist had his labcoat stripped from his shoulders during the struggle, whereupon it was appropriated by a Mod who went on to become a speed cook. The garment hanging from Hiro's shoulders, sleeves rolled back to half-conceal the chemical burns scorching the fabric, shows it's history. The blank white pin affixed at his collar, however, tells no stories.  A white t-shirt bears a black and red steer's head: ']D[' embossed in fixedsys font. Black cargo pants faded to grey collect around the tops of dingy white sneakers, many-zippered pockets cross-hatching the thighs.  "Ohmygoshsorryareyouhurt?" Hiro releases Penny immediately, then -- near-immediately, or perhaps most immediately post-immediately -- hugs her again, then releases her again, seems to get caught in some kind of dull feedback loop. Stops. Physically stutters. Blinks owlishly. His eyes have the look of a solar eclipse. "Sorry. Hi, Abel. What the fuck is going on?" Big, hesitant kid's smile.  Penny keeps Hiro close, her fingers sinking deep into arm-tissue, keeps him from breaking her in half. She asides to him, mouth more or less occluded by the bulging rim of his glasses, "It's Pobs, did a thing and" Hiro can feel whatever kind of gesture she makes. Something that signifies this thing can not be helped or sorted. "We uh.. " indicating Abel "just met." And to put a point on it, a wad of cash and business card tumbles out of the disarray of other-dress and gathered coat in Penny's arms.  Seeing that Penny is latched on to Hiro, and knowing theyu aren't going to topple any Time soon, Abel stoops down to scoop up the cash and card. He doesn't look at... it's not his business. "You should probably get her to a doctor. I'd help if I could, but, Like, I'm not good with that kind of stuff." He pauses a moment. "I bet Jane Connelly could help her."  "Oh," mubles Hiro. He frowns just faintly, squints at Abel, and runs a hand down Penny's side. Perhaps he's feeling up her ribcage. Mrowr. Cognition flickers somewhere in saucerlike eyes, a spark somewhere beneath the placid surface. "Who's the dirty roman?" he asks. Then: "N'thanks. Conelly doesn't like us much."  Penny insists, if a bit belatedly "I'm not /hurt/." Whatever it is Penny considers herself, it's not one of the walking wounded. If you can ignore her eyeballs rolling to whites when Hiro does that thing with his hand, Penny might be covincing. "Nnn...noli me tangere," the words resurected in the harshest whisper.  Snaps. Clicks back into place. She nudges Hiro and thrusts her chin at the cash "Pocket that," snapped from whatever trance that was "doneednoquack," gritting through her teeth.  Abel hands the wad of Cash to Hiro. "Yeah... I know you guys don't." He says very little on the subject. Not that he looks like he doesn't have an opinion about the matter, but that he thinks it best to keep it to himself.  A dumb stare at the wad of money; Hiro stands there, in the middle of el ghetto, gawking like an idiot. The business card is eyeballed like some incredibly complex, intense puzzle. "Mmmyeah," he counters, dumbly. The taxi is just idling there, running up a bill -- Pig-boy looks back over his shoulder. The wad gets stuffed, haphazardly, into a pocket of his labcoat. "Talkatchoo later, honest abe. Me'n Pen need to get back to bible study." A stupid grin, as if this was some incredibly clever in-joke shared by all present. It isn't.  It is. But it isn't. "Nice ta" and Penny shows an absent twiddle of fingers. witched to autopilot, she lets Hiro take over. He moves her in a way that suggests this is practiced. Learned. Habitual. There's order here; jacket and dress balled up and thrown into the backseat then he takes both her hands. Wrapping them close to her body, he positions her backwards into the cracked pleather and lifts her wholly into the cradle of the rear bench beneath the knee.  The little perv.  Her head tips back and to the side, lolls before Hiro slams the door shut. Her forehead presses to the glass, fog of bodyheat rising in a halo around her head.  Abel nods. "Peace be With the both of you, and Providence guide your steps. And call me sometime Hiro... or come by St. Matt's. Like, we haven't talked in ages and I always enjoyed the ones we had." He pats a lump in one of his pockets. "Aaron's got me to go cellular now so I'm moch more reachable."  If you can't keep it in your pants, keep it in the cabal. There's some kind of argument with the driver, and the cab peels out.

      You enter the apartment. Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Keene  //.etro: It is 02:37 am, the dead of night, on Friday the 16. day of January, 2009.  Door to the room bangs open and Penny stands there stomping slush and muck off her feet. "Weather's shit," dropping the coat from her shoulders into elbows further dirtying the hallway. The door closes behind her, kicks off her boots "I hate it here," grumpy and ticked off for any number of reasons, Penny starts emptying pockets to the nightstand.  A notepad, a cellphone, an unfamiliar wallet, a strange set of keys all clatter down to the delaminated surface.  Keene is sitting on the floor, shoes off, jacket hung up neatly, smoking one of his usual cigarettes. He is watching `The Shining' on free cable, which acts as an idle distraction.  As it goes to commercial, Keene looks over at Penny. "Join the club. I can't wait for the Realm to blow up. I think I'll have a little party afterward."  "Well it's ah very homey." "Yes."  Penny stands idle for a minute watching Jack on the screen. Still stripping out of soaked clothes, Penny undresses her way into the bathroom. Walking out of jeans, bloody t-shirts hefted into the sink, you can hear the shower start. She's only in there about five minutes when the shower stops. Returning to the room in another of Jesse's shirts, Penny mutters something indetrminate about Eva loving him more and something darker about Pobble, god and unhelpful asian whores.  "I'm having a psychotic episode, Keene. I need something."  "Up or down?" asks Keene, watching the ice cream scene. A month later Penny responds, chin resting on folded hands  "Down. Way the fuck down."  "Man. I miss my bigwheels."  Keene ashes his cigarette into an empty beer can at his side, reaching into his breast pocket and pulling out one of his customary orange vials. He offers it to Penny. "Valium. Take 'em with a shot of Jack. Good for you."  He looks back towards the screen, puffing on his cancer stick some more. "I wonder what happened to Olive Oyl's career after the 70s."  Penny keeps explaining, turning over a keycard looking for the number. "Found the traitor fuck. Then I found the old man getting his ass kicked.. " intimating that some serious retribution needs doling. Penny pushes down on the stupid child-safety cap but it doesn't open. Tries it again, gets it to pop and fingers out two pills, takes them dry.  "She did this fucked up children's show .. fairy tale movies.. I think she had a total break after this movie."  "Pretty wack," mutters Keene, resting his cigarette on the beer can before pausing to stretch his arms. The hedge maze beckons. "Scary looking bitch regardless. Very 70s."  He picks back up his cigarette. "So where's the Benedict?"  "Those teeth, right?" propping herself on an elbow, shuddering theatrically. "Wheres'a jack .." feeling down around on the floor for the bottle "..him? he's up the block," struggling to find the bottleneck somewhere under the bed "hangs out with some nasty sort. Kinda hardcore but maybe a littel to trendy. Anyways. This spirit says he's always there, never leaves. So I figure we stake it out long enough, won't be.. y'know.. too tough."  Keene grunts. "Fucking shut-ins," he says, as it goes to commercial again. "If these people got laid more, they'd probably be a lot more understanding of Truth. Of course, I imagine fucking cabbages has its own particular charm." He puffs on the cigarette.  "I'll have Hiro go trashing around the place. We'll track his financial movements and behaviors for a while. Then we start systematically leaving tracks for the Black Hats to find. Let them take out the trash."  Success. Her hand ferrets out the elusive and mostly empty bottle, upcaps and swigs. "Ah ah ah, Wendy" she says to the television, chastizing "castles don't have phones."  Fishing around in your top pocket for a cigarette, tiny flecks of blood stain the white double-fold on the inside.  "Is that what we want to do? Why should they have all the fun," slowing down now but not sluggish "Keen-o, that's complete crap... oo I love this part," lighting-up with a stray bic, exhaling over your head "kid's a little fucker 'inne."  "Damn right he is," says Keene, finishing his cigarette and dropping it into the beer can. "Well, it's up to you guys. I just want his ass dropped -- I don't really care how it gets done."

      Downtown - Parliament and Front E(#164RJM)       The downtown core can be seen in the horizon to the west. Here lie many of Toronto's old and abandoned warehouses. Fences set ten feet high with barbed wires interlacing the top portion guards this area closely. Despite the look of these dilapidated warehouses, this is a popular filming area for major motion pictures. The abandoned warehouses make a perfect location for many scenarios used in action movies and TV shows. Overhead, to the west lies the Gardiner Expressway where it joins with the major north-south highway, the Don Valley Parkway. To the west is the St. Lawrence Market and Union Station, while to the south is the docks to Lake Ontario.  Obvious exits:  Hana arrives from the north. Hana has arrived.  //.etro: Auto-aliasing to +today. (see +help +time for more)   _________________________  //.etro: Toronto by Night _________________________                              //.etro-logical Data                              ______________________________________________________________________________  It is 09:39 on Thursday the 15. day of January 2009.  Sunrise:    7:29     Sunset:  16:30 Moonrise:  09:41     Moonset: 22:42 It is week 3 of the month and the first quarter moon is not up. The tide is low and ebbing. Sleet and freezing rain fall from heavy clouds, coating everything with ice and making the ground slippery. The world looks silver in the icy grey light. A raw wind blows from the northeast. ______________________________________________________________________________ Hana walks down the street, not minding the rain much, or the fact that her hair is turning to ice.  Compton, oddly enough is just standing there in the freezing rain. The Fur lined hood of his parka drawn up over his head. He stands staring at an old industrial complex, his fingers intertwined with the rusted chain-linked fence. With the anfgle of the hood and the loud pattering of the thick rain off of it it is doubtful he realizes anyone is around.  Maybe Hana recognizes the figure, if not the face. She slows, a dismal dripping half-frozen drowned cat. Stopping behind him, she looks past him at the industrial complex assuming you mean the light industrial shop?.  Okay, yes the Light Industrial Shop then. He just keeps standing there as if frozen stiff gazing at the structure, or perhaps sleeping on his feet with the deep rythmic breathing Compton seems to be performing.  //.etro: Compton rolls "perception+awareness" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es).  And just keeps on staring, oblivious. Hana dips her head and rubs her neck, running rivers of water from her hair into her eyes. Then, quietly, she steps up to the fence, beside Compton.  From the side profile, you can pick up on two things: 1. It is in fact the old perv from the bar and 2. he's wearing some weird-assed three lensed pair of goggles over his face that emit an eerie green light. Which is why he most likely isn't picking up on too much right now...  //.etro: Compton rolls "perception+awareness" at diff 6          For a botch!  Hana finds his seeming obliviousness slightly amusing-- but that's only amusing enough to make her lips twist into what is, at best, a sort of sad, ironical smile. She's barely managing her normally pacific expression today. But enough about what Compton doesn't even see. The rain probably muffles the faint swish of her sopping coat. She waits a few moments more.  A large city works truck comes rumbling up the street. The pinwheels under it spinning fast and throwing a copious amount of road salt on the road and up over the sidewalk. A loud chiming is created by the hard pellets bouncing off the chainlinks. It isn't moving fast though and most people can move out of the way and avoid it. Not ole Compton though. Stuck transfixed as he is on the spot.  (SPLAT!) (CRUNCH!)  Compton is thrown up against the fence violently when he gets his in the back of the head with a particularly large chunk of road salt. The Springboard action of the chainlinks then propell him backwards and down to the now gritty pavement. (It also just happens that due to the angle and position of Compton, Hana is completely protected by the passing truck.)  "Ow. Fuck!" is the frank observation from the big guy. His goggles askew and a fresh cut on his forhead starts to seep blood.  From his position on the ground, he can observe Hana at a bizarre angle. She looks down at him from a seemingly great height, one of her hands still on the fence as she looks over her shoulder. The same little wan smile touches her lips. Watching the rain wash the blood down his face, Hana sayds, after a moment, "Are you hurt?" Ya think?  Compton struggles a little bit to even make it to his elbows, "Wha?" is his second response and he pulls his goggles down around his neck and dazzedly squints at Hana, "Who...?" is his third comment and finally reaching to his forehead with two fingers and touches the wound, "Ow. Fuck." again. Guess that's an affirmative.  "You're going to need a bandaid," Hana says, with possibly irritating frank observation. "I don't have any." She turns fully from the fence and steps forward, offering the man a hand. To look at the two, it's amusing to think she could pull him up. More likely she'll end up flat on her face.  "Ss'sallright." Compton manages sounding stupifed. Rolling to one side on the slippery sidewalk and gets to his knees, which complain loudly at the abuse. Standing now, he's soaked through, the parka not much good when lying on yer back in 1/4" of slush. He pulls off the stupid looking Santa's cap he was wearing under the hood and uses it as a make shift bandage.   Now that he's more together he gives a side long glance at Hana again. Reapprasing her from his 6ft stance. "Ow. Fuck." to the wound, and then, "Wh-why'd ya hit me for?" he asks testily. "If I had hit you, you wouldn't be in a position to ask me why," she says, rather sombrely. She turns and walks back to the fence, placing her hands on the top again. "What's so fascinating about the shop?" she asks, obviously meaning the building at which you were formerly staring.  Compton looks unconvinced at the first statement but pulls the cap away and prods at his forehead again. The bleedings stopped, which ain't too bad for a guy his age. Tossing the hat away in to the street he pulls his hood back up and covers his quickly freezing head, "Lookin for someone. Got a hunch 'bout this place. It shit though." Of cource, said guy could have been standing next to him and Compton would have missed it this morning. He looks tired. His face is drawn, moreso than the last time you saw him. Dark rings under his bloodshot eyes speak to a long night of staring at random buildings.  "Really? I've lived there," she says, leaning against the fence. "By the way, you owe me money." She rubs the back of her neck again. She's soaked pretty much to the bone, as if she's been soaking in cold water for a long time. The way someone looks when drenched in hours of rain is somehow more pathetic than if they've been dunked in a lake.  Compton grimaces at the fact he's been staring at your home for the last hour in vain, "Yeah well... ain't the right place." he says defensivley. The cold and the wet and now the gouge in his forehead make Compton look even more haggard than before, taking it beyond pathetic to tragically sad. At least without the hat now he looks less homeless. "What?" he asks incrediously, "Fuck you I do." his his not so friendly reply to the joke.  only it's not a joke. Funny thing, a little girl asking an older, much larger man for the money he owes her. "Well, no, there was no fucking, but I did what I could. I can't help it if he vomitted." She glances towards the house again. "Maybe that is the right place, hm?"  "No, it's not and no I don't." Compton says incresingly agitated, "I remember that night pretty good, and you stated some fucked up dollar amount then attacked the kid. Never said I'd pay... If anything I owe you a favour. That's it." and undoes the strap holding his goggles in place around his neck and stuffs them in one of the pockets of his coat.  Hana lifts a hand and smooths back her wet hair, flinging drops of water behind her, invisible in the rain. "Come on, you're not going to make me -insist-, are you? I mean, after I put you on your back again, I'll have to go get Alex and explain to him he's got his house staked out. I really don't like him right now, not on good terms since he thinks I tried to kill him. It'll just be a big bother."  Maybe it's the fact that he's a sexist, ageist pig and doesn't feel threatened standing before a soggy china doll, or maybe it is just the fact that hanging out with outcasts has just inured him to threats period. "Yeah, okay. Whatever little girl. Ya ain't getting a dollar from me, so go fuck off." is his increasingly less eloquent reply. The guys had a bad start to a day he is most likely willing to go forget in a bottle of rye.  Compton also looks like he about to go on his way.  Hana stands still and silent.  Hana seems to be letting you go on your way, watching as, or until, you turn your back on her.  Compton promptly turns his back on Hana and goes to walk across the street.  //.etro: Hana rolls "dexterity+brawl" at diff 6          For a total of 5 success(es).  Perhaps you don't even realize what's happened until you hit the ground; perhaps the shock of hitting the ground keeps you from realizing it, even then. Something certainly happened, though, and there, above you, you can see Hana looking down. "Very sorry, but I need the money. I am tired of sleeping in trees."  Penny arrives from the west. Penny has arrived.  Compton rolls over furious. There's murder in his eyes, "What the fuck cunt?!" he exclaims, perhaps not as affective a statement lying in the frozen street as it could have been. "Yer fucked now." Again, intimidating, not so much.  Compton is lying in the street now, yelling at the tiny girl. Calling her very nasty things and he too is soaked through with a fresh gouge in his forehead. Some sort of papers in hand, Penny gets out of a cab at the corner of Parliament and Front streets bidding the cabbie a cheerful thanks-and-goodbye as she opens up a huge umbrella. There's an incredibly strange air about the woman - happy as a pig in shit.  Singin'in the rain.  Penny splashes about down the street for half a block with some destination in mind before she catches on to the commotion over yonder.  "Oi! Old man?"  //.etro: Hana rolls "dexterity + athletics" at diff 6          For a total of 1 success(es).  Hana stretches, putting her hand behind her neck, and her other hand behind her back, betwen her coat and t-shirt. "No, trust me, fucking would be a lot more expensive. Look, you said you were weqalthy enough. i think "loaded" was the word? So why being so stingy? Come on gaijin, get off your ass and pay up. And maybe while we're at it, you wannt tell me why you're spying on that place over there, hm?" Hana leans over, and pulls off the odd pair of goggles Compton's wearing. Not too easy, getting them from around his neck.  "Ain't got no million bucks to spend on a do nuthin whore, especially one that I didn't agree to pay." Compton says pushing himself off the ground, sheets of slush falling form his back.  Closer now, Penny yells "OI," through the sleet and rain "OLD MAN?" like she's confused. That couldn't be what or who she thinks it is. It's too early - there isn't even a lunch crowd loitering. She half-circles to get a better look and ..stops.  "Two things wrong with that," Hana says. "One, I'm not a whore, which I told you, and two, you did say you would pay me anyway. Now, usually I'm damned easy-going, but I've been having a pissy lifetime, and almost getting vomitted on by a highflying chingaku doesn't help." Hana steps back a few feet, putting the goggles around her neck with her own pair. "I suppose we can do this later, though. I guess I owe it to Alex to tell him he's being watched."  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Everybody feels abnormally calm. Everything's coming up motherfucking roses. That bad day you were having? Gone. It's like you just won the goddamn lottery.  Compton flinches at Penny hollaring and looks like he's about to fly in to another torrent of explatives at the lil nipper. But instead smiles real big and dopey like and says "Hi Penny." all chipper like.  No noticable change in Hana. In fact, she seemed pretty calm already. Weird enough. Oh, but wait, she does seem less sombre...  Compton sloshes up the street all sodden from lying in it. Grinning like a fucking idiot.  Hana watches Compton's dramatic change. Not feeling dramatically different herself,, she does, however, decide to let the matter drop. besides, she's got his goggles. Maybe that will do for payment. She starts heading north, herself.  And Penny, taking Compton by the elbow, moves between the mounds of snow and crap back to the sidewalk. Penny is not smiling. Penny doesn't seem to be affected by this calming sensation, says loud enough to be overheard by any passer-by "Y'like it when little girls pound on you, hey old man?" and she turns an unflinching eye over her shoulder to Hana "Those're booby-trapped, chiquita" and keeps walking with Compton under her umbrella. She hails a cab and ushers him in.  ~FIN~

      You journey up one of the trails to the quiet park area. Centre Island - Island Park(#1262RnJ)       The beaches on the island's south side are supervised in July and August. A wide range of facilities are available, including washrooms, drinking fountains, water taps, lots of picnic areas with fire pits, first-aid stations and police. Small beaches, wooded areas, open grass picnic places and a couple of stone garden sites also dot this southern end of the island, creating a nice, relaxing atmosphere to enjoy the company of friends and family. The multitude of bike, rollerblade and jogging trails makes the park land home to many sport enthusiests in the summer months. The park is cleaned and well maintained, groundskeepers can be seen busily cutting grass, picking up carelessly thrown litter or otherwise ensuring the beauty of the island.  Contents: Pobble Obvious exits: Centre Island     //.etro: It is 02:10 am, the dead of night, on Tuesday the 13. day of January, 2009.  Pobble stands on a smaller section of beach, a notoriously easy to spot furry sillouette captured in the moonlight for a second before a cloud dims the glow. Braids shift slightly in the grasp of the wind but remain mostly held down with their implanted implements. A cherry moves slowly as the figure sucks on a cigarette, the smoke whipping around his head with the ocean breeze. He stands right on the waterfront, small waves lapping at his boots.  This place is deserted. Nobody hangs out on a beach in the dead of winter; the winds keep normal, sane people in their place. Penny comes walking up from a beach on the south side of the island, boots tied together by their laces and slung over her shoulder. Jeans rolled up past the knee; they look dark. Wet or stained. Walking slowly toward you along an erroded dune, her footprints are washed away in the ebbing high tide. //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a botch!  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 3 success(es). You paged Pobble with 'Tell me what's in your head.'. Pobble pages: Jealousy, lonliness.. Angst monkies.  Something falls from the man's left non-smoking hand. A small capsule, bouncing in the lull of the tide before it gets swept out, a needle's point flashing in the starlight before being pulled into a wave.  The man gasps, and starts to sway as if about to fall. He takes a step back, almost involuntarily but something goes wrong. His right leg bends the wrong way, as if it had snapped at the knee, such a surreal sight it is. The furry fellow falls backwards, landing flat out on the sand arms out to either side in cruciform.  The tide has seemed to take pity on the man, as it retreats further. A weary hand shakes sand from the cigarette before taking another puff, with a sigh.  Mashing down cliffside, Penny picks up the pace a little and books down the shoreline kicking up sand and crunching down seashells. Her hand skims the surface a few times trying to make a grab at the floating needle, gives up on the third attempt.  Dragging weeds and sludge from the lake, Penny trudges back toward the place where you fell and kicks at your foot. "Stop it. He isn't gone, he isn't GONE." She kneels on your right and picks up your wrist, feeling for a pulse "It's a timeshare thing. Jumps around," and feels around in the pocket of the coat for cigarettes. "Where's your lighter, c'mon.."  Indeed there is a lighter, and a crumpled softpack of imported Dunhill 100s. Dr Steve's leg twitches the wrong way, and close up its apparent that his boots are covered in a thick layer of algae, almost gluing them to the sand.  "I know.."       "Its just.. You wondered why Jesus thought it were so bad. He was going to get back up fighting in 3 days, back in heaven. Was no loss right?"          "That was the hard part. Having God turn away. Turn. Away." The line is punctuated with a long drag on the cigarette, illuminating damp sand speckled cheeks, and scratches along the 'crown of thorns'.  He flashes a smile, alas a somewhat lame attempt at one. His empty hand reaches up to his hat, laying off to one side of his head and extracts a small parcel from the band near Cally - The Fool.  The thin, wrinkled plastic sleeve comes loose, a sudden gust shivering it down to the driftwood. For it size, it makes a lot of noise, catching in between fallen branches and the remains of a picked-at gull picnic. Penny makes with the flick-flicking, cornering the cigarette between her lips and twists her body carefully but the trenchcoat slips its knots and blood seeps through her shirts.  Hands cupped just right, she pauses, silhouetted in the crescent moon "Cut that shit out, Jesus was just a man."  The wind dies long enough for her to light up and she tosses the plastic thing square on your chest. "This thing is playing you, playing us. It's a sickness, a virus. It's got up in the blood and it wants something. After new years? I was at this thing and I swear someone was washing my feet" then an afterthought "can feel it when I dream."  She palms the lit end and looks down at you "Is divine euphoria supposed to peak like this? Look at you, you're bottoming out."  A vague smile twists Pobble's lips as if remembering something pleasant. A fingertip rubs at the retrieved paper parcel as his arm returns to rest on his chest. The last draw on the cigarette encompasses the cork coloured filter in its burn, but the noxious fumes don't seem to affect the chemist. A deft fingerflip sends the butt flying and its lifted away on a brief gust of wind.  "Jesus was just a metaphor." Ice eyes swivel to view you, and a now free hand moves vaguely towards your feet at talk of washing, as if drawn of its own accord. The lapping water decides to make an untimely run, almost passing the level of Pobble's boots. One foot avoids the deluge by an uncanny motion of a reversed knee. There's a spasm, with its accompanying facial twist, and his thigh straightens out. Leg returns down hard, thumping the heel into the sand.  "Weird ain't it." He puts the paper parcel in his mouth, gripping it against the wind in his teeth as he retrives a small device from a pocket. A block with a pair of deep grooves, one of which is mostly filled with a silver tube.  Sitting indian-style she agrees "Yes," watching your hand fall short of her feet, maybe "It's fucking weird." Wrists balanced after a fashion across knees, the one with the cigarette hardly moves - the wind does all her ashing for her.  A fog has started to coallesce and rise off the lake; reducing visibility rapidly, the dry haze is almost blue. In the distance a foghorn is blowing and a whistle replies with one long then two short blasts.  She drags long and watches the butt roll down the little incline, watches the white wrapper grey-out in the water "What's that?" indicating with a brief nod to the block.  Dr Steve sits up, and in the hollow of his legs, he places the block atop his coat, extracting the tube. The parcel is retrieved from his teeth and he unfolds it with the extreme patience and dilligence as one would use while constructing an origami statue of liberty. Some deft tapping and arranging results in the pink contents of the package being released into the grooves. He does however, continue to wrangle the paper until it forms the shape of a strange little plane which he releases to the wind.  His hair seems somewhat unruly in the wind, and emits a tinkling as the glass components hit each other. The hat flips over and rolls off to the side, repositioning itself face down and causing the card to fall out and dance along the sand.  "Best Christmas present ever?" he asks, smiling despite his mood - a little of the old Dr Steve showing through. The old, but tired Dr Steve. The silver tube is placed into one of the grooves and shielded from the wind, the block is proffered to you. His gaze shifts from you out to what's left visible of the lake amidst the fog. "Should we die, the world may end." he says, somewhat out of the blue.  The foghorn blasts another short round and ripples move across the lake. Out there is the sputtering hum of a motor boat. A dying engine, choked with brine and other things best left at the bottom of a lake.   "But we're seven days outside the Epiphany," the drug talking again, using Penny's voice to protest something about the timing, the timing is all wrong. Wrestling with this idea, she doesn't realize she's smoked down to the filter and is surprised when her fingertips are singed. She tosses off the cigarette and eyes the tube. Pink's familiar. Looks at the block   "You first."  Pobble shifts on the sand and negociates with his head until it aligns itself with the left hand groove. Taking the silver tube he plants one end in block, one end in nose. A fingertip on empty nostril and shhhhhhht. Eyes close for a second, blinking involuntarily and a catalogue issue smile plants itself square upon his lips. A wobbly hand once more proffers the implement in your direction, and after a second it moves back as Steve slumps back to rest on one elbow. The block still proffered, just further out of reach. Lazy fucker.  "Is he still angry at being trapped?" he asks in a faint warbling tone.  "I told you."  Penny's hand makes a grab for the block and straw, "it wants something. Doesn't stay angry very long, tries to come at me when I sleep but there's Jesse's place and he can't get in" and seeing as Pobble hasn't expired she doses just as fast. Doesn't smile though. It doesn't hit her the same way. Knuckling into her nose both sides, Penny shakes her head, elbows down on the silty pebble sand. Sun's starting to come up so she keeps her eyes on the horizon.  "He moves in mysterious ways." they said. Pobble shrugs, bringing up his apparently unbroken knees and hugging them against the cold, with fists clenched as not to bloody the material. His coat shifts in the wind, patterns forming and unforming in the shag of the fur.  "I'm still working on DivComp3. It'll be.. interesting. Need to do some study.." he pauses to shudder with some euphoric glint in his eye. "And reprocessing. We'll see.." He turns from you again, following your gaze to the sunrise.

      [Ed. Note: Cheerios, cocaine and lsd: The Breakfast of Champions]  Derlict House - Kitchen    Beneath two stories, lies a basement with all the common amenities. However, it's been converted into a semi living space.   In one corner, a boiler and heater stand, though only function down here. The fuse box is also configured to power the subterranean portion of this structure. A washer drier are next, and a small makeshift sink. All four walls have been padded with heavy insulating material and wires run down from key holes in the ceiling. A few bundle are strapped together, feeding into a video network system. Four screens sit at a small square table, flashing camera feeds from strategic points outside and inside the house above. A reclining chair, made of brown leather, encircled with ashes and empty beer bottles on the hard cement floor. A TV sits atop another broken TV, it's wires arranged to split off the block's main cable system.    To the far wall, a long table has been set up, stacked with a variety of chemical compounds and mixing material. Everything from begin base liquids, to corrosive acids stored in chem-hazard tanks. A myriad mix of beakers, vials, and test-tubes line the shelves above. Gloves, goggles, tongs, all things a junior mad scientist would need to conquer the world. Some larger steel drums of chemicals are stored under the table, and some electronic chem-analysis equipment blinks an occasional red flash.   And finally, set along the length of the large basement, seems to be a make-shift firing range. Shell casings litter the floor at one end, opposite from a large reinforced steel door dimpled with a thousand bullet dents. The remains of a tattered paper target hang on the door. Over it, a picture of Ronald McDonald.    Contents: Chase Obvious exits: Reinforced Door    Stairs Up       Chase is totally eating Cheerios right now.  She comes down the stairs slower than the last time, does a kind of slide-cling thing along the wall. Sounds different; canvas on painted foundation. Looks different, too, in her bright red trenchcoat. Penny half-jumps the last few steps.  "YO."  The response is muffled by breakfast goodness, just the way to start a morning. "'O." A single circle of cereal falls from Chase's thin lips, taking a few drops of whole milk with it. Hunched forward in his leather chair, the TV's talkin' about Bill Cosby's latest illegitimate son. A backhand wipes some mess from Chase's square chin, he's still wearing last night's outfit.   "Sup neegro?"  Chase read your description.  "Fliponnatoons, hey" coming up behind the leather chair, crunching on something she's got in her pockets "or like Jerry, the snooze rots your brain y'know." She says this with some authority, plopping indian-style next to the chair, eyes fixed on the screen.  Cereal crunching, Chase turns back to the screen and raises the remote.   He hopes that by 'Jerry', she meant 'Springer'. Because at any given moment, in any given country, Jerry Springer is on some fucking channel. Today, on a very special Springer, 'I hate my wife's purse'.   Chase looks back to Penny, speaking with a mouthful. "Wha' 'ou thin' 'bout that chi' 'epsy, eh?"  Of course she did. The audience is up, chanting for The Man Himself. Chairs are almost on the rise - check out the redneck in the green silk shirt.  Zoned out way before she got here, Penny tips her head to the side studying the screen. Strangely inebriated, cornflakes litter the floor where she misses her mouth mumbling something significant about the creator and the creation. this is apparently all she has to offer on the topic, jumping directly to "Have you seen Pobble? God's concerned." The trench pools off her shoulders, sits on her waist and legs, trapping her arms. She doesn't seem to notice, goes on "We can feel him, like magnetic north. We just don't know where he is."  "Sup with that god shit, anyways?" Chase takes a tactical pause and reaches inside his coat to pull out a snuff vial. Filled to the brim with powder. Some up his left nostril, and a healthy dose spread upon his Cheerios. A few sniffles follows, he makes circular motions in the milk with his spoon. Before she can answer, he goes on. "No. Last I saw 'm he was runnin' outta here trippin' balls. He always like that?"  "I thought maybe Mexico but then he said 'Don't be trite'" mimicking someone or other following her own thread, continuing in that same booming voice "'we can not tolerate that level of filth' so then I thought maybe Rio and he didn't have anything to say about that," evening out to her indoor voice. Forgetting any impulse to chew or even bother with food, Penny picks up a magazine and holds it up infront of her face during a commercial. "God is one of us." A pause.  "Or both of them. And we can not be together but we can also never be apart." Another pause.  "It's very complicated."  A spoon full of cocaine and Cheerios hovers near Chase's lips. Red eyes look down to his seated guest. "Wha... No." He shakes his head and eats.   *Crunch* "'N Rio's dirtier than Mexico could ever be. They fuckin' sell 12 year old boys in shanty villages, 'n the whole place smells like spoiled coconut oil and dirty thongs." *Crunch* "This is one yer messed up cabal thingies, right? Wait, forget it. I don' wanna know." He points with his spoon, "Pass me that beer."  You say, "The trouble is the reception. Messages stop coming in clear," she sighs, slouching toward the longneck nearest her until she realizes there's the coat. The stupid coat enforcing consequential restriction of movement. "and he thinks he can take it back but it has to /want/" to punctuate, to underline that she tears her left arm out of the sleeve, "to leave. And it doesn't."  Rocking forward, she reaches for the beer and lands back with a wince.  "Plus it likes this batch. Amped the frequency."  Penny does juggle the magazine and bottle inbetween fingers pretty well at first but there's a dangerous second where she might drop one or both. However she made the grab, it's clear either her hands aren't big enough to manage or that signal-block she was talking about stems her motor functions as well.  Muffled noises come from Chase's full mouth and he shakes a spoon. He wants no explanation. Just to hear it, might infect him with some of her craziness. But the beer's accepted, yes. That, he wants. And promptly washes down some narcotic cereal. Holding the beer and bowl, his gums go numb and he makes funny smacking sounds.   "Fuckin' 'ell... froze my damn teeth." A few clack against his stained choppers with his spoon just to test up. "Fuck." There's a few twitching motions. "Fuck. So ya didn't answer my question. Whadja think bout that Hepsy girl? Least she didn't scream when that talking monkey came at 'r, eh."  She sits there watching the program change from Jerry to Judge Joe Brown with seamless continuity, blinking. "It's hard to communicate," digging around in one of the pockets, she pulls out a small stack of business cards and lays them out before her making a tarot cross "because at times there's an intense euphoria, the drug in the blood and in the skin" still trying to explain things, Penny turns card after card over. They all say the same thing: RYAN REEVES - REPORTER in a stocky block print. "so 'I' can only observe."  She sits up a little, peering at the cards "She seemed nice. Willing to believe is key."  A tick build in one of his eyes, Chase sets the mostly empty bowl down on the table behind him and has more warm beer. "She was runnin' with another crew, vaguely connected to my peeps. Buncha bubblegum hold up kids though. Need ta get a few calluses on 'r hands." Yes, there's the whole deck, eh. RYAN REEVES taunts Chase from the floor, prompting him to turn his head minutely. "What's that about?" He still got the spoon, it makes a great pointer.  Penny repeats "Bubble gum," losing her focus. Her eyes roll to whites for about half a second then "That was strange," and leaves it at that.  Milk from the pointer/spoon drips across the floor and rolls back under the chair in twin fingers. A badly laid foundation is no surprise in this part of town. Penny slips her other arm out of the coat and starts turning the cards so they all face the same direction. "After I saw you in the gardens I ran into him."  Slowly she pieces the night together, phrases fractured around this obsessive/compulsive act of card-turning "I was a little fucked up. And still bleeding. And he wanted to give me a ride."  "And then he gave me his coat."  "Suits ya, I suppose." Again testing his gums. Numb. "Fuck." Chase leans back into a position more conducive to relaxing.   "That monkey tripped me out. How the shit you deal with that all day? I lose my shit I think."  "I'm here, aren't I?" turn-swish of the card on the floor, collecting powder and dust of every kind underneath. "He used to be cool. Then he like.. grew up. I dunno .. do familiar's even HAVE hormones?  "Dunno. Think he's the first i've met that wasn't trapped in a grid-splice on some partible Mac. 'S way better than any A.I. shite. Fucker even smokes." Chase, still feeling his frontward gums.  "Needs a leash," said with none of Penny's usual venom and bile where the monkey's concerned; she's pretty fucking calm right about now. "..s'much of a genius Steve is, he hasn't been able to make one what that monkey can't get out of. Lost him once in Bel Air... that was a fucking trip.." trip.. hahaha, Penny's laughter mostly swallowed.  Laughter's contagious, but her's only inspires a chuckle. And even that is marred by Chase's fingers between his lips and gums. "Like the old dude to, he was money with the heat. Any of you fuckers got skills with bitches? I mean -skills- ya know. Be happy ta pass on the S.E.A.L. training. Handy shite, it is."   //.etro: Penny rolls "6" privately to Penny at diff 6.          For a total of 5 success(es).  [Ed Note: The last few poses of this scene have been edited out to protect the innocently retarded individuals writing the scene. They were tired, they were cranky and mostly they were illiterate. It went something like: Penny displays gun-fu, Chase goes okay, fine. Be that way. Penny leaves, Chase takes a piss. The End.]

      Rolling Fields          It's a gorgeous sight, even in the dark of night, the brilliant yellows and greens of tall grasses waving in the chill wind, rolling hills stretching off as far as the eye can see. Pure, white stars shine in the breaks of the thick, dark cloud cover above, bringing a mild, yet still chilled, warmth to the vast expanse of land.         As you reach the peak of one of the highest hills, you are able to survey the land as the scent of life washes over you. Almost ninety degrees from the hill with the huge, gaping hole, and far off into the distance there is a massive forest, several deer darting into the trees as you spot it, as if sensing your discerning eye. Immediately opposite it is a large body of water, from which the cave stream flows. Ninety degrees from it, directly opposite the cavern entrance, there rests Novus Valnastium, a large stone complex resting atop another hill, one lone tower stretching into the sky above.         A little off to the northeast (assuming Novus is north), a small, metallic-bowl structure sits. Long tethers sometimes stretch into the sky from beyond it, connecting to a marvelous airship docked above the bowl. The slender curves and high-tech metals used on the small building are a stark contrast to the ruins just fifty yards away, and it easily gives away who is responsible for such a building.                                 NIGHTZONE   Contents: Alyx Dave the Monkey Pobble Chase Obvious exits:  Cadence wanders out of Novus Valnastium in the distance, slowly closing ground until she has arrived in the heart of the fields. Cadence has arrived.  Compton sloshes out of the cave. His heavy winter boots waterlogged by his interdimensional splunkering... and he look thrilled for it too.  Alyx has disconnected.  Cadence walks out quickly, scratching at her shoulder. She seems to be in a hurry, glancing around her, but moving intently toward her destination.  Chase is standing near Dave the monkey and senior Pobble. And despite being located somewhere near Mars at the moment, he looks rather confused by the sight of a talking monkey. A camera is slung about his neck as it flashes a tiny green light, one associated with lowlight functions. Square jaws flexing on gum, trying to crush every last sugary morsel from it.   *Pop*  Cadence heads down the hill and up the other, disappearing into the cavern's darkness. Cadence has left.  Pobble stands with Dave near Chase, staring off into the void with a smoking blue tube between his lips. Dr Steve looks sad and unhealthy in the sickly light of the glowstick that is attached to his lapel.  "You're fackin weird, I'd heard great things about you, but I don't see it.." says Dave. The monkey looks up at Pobble. "Oi." it says, but Pobble doesn't respond. He seems to have developed an attention lock on the void. Ash falls from his smoke down over the white fur.  Compton trudges down the hill. His boots making audible squishing noises the entire way. He unzips his parka now that it isn't needed here in the artificial warmth of a black hole shining down on everyone. A large bottle falls out of the loosened coat as he marches. Stopping briefly to stoop with a grunt and snatch it from the grass. Yanking the cork out with his teeth he takes a belt as he approaches Pobble & Co.  That prompts Chase to smile. Stained teeth shinning back at the monkey in brilliant shades of dulled yellows and caffeine browns. "Well, I supposed i've been accused of worse things than looking weird." Taking a moment from his eternal behind the ear scratching, Chase points a callused finger at the monkey. "Nice ta meetcha, just the same." And back to Pobble, who seems perhaps distracted. "Right then. Who the fuck are you two again?" As if he forgot to ask. But it's an understandable distraction, a talking monkey. You two, meaning Pobble and Dave, as Chase hasn't registered the old dude yet.  Pobble holds the smoking blue at Chase, "Pobble." he says in almost a whisper. Palest blue eyes hold the void in their depths, as if the doctor's soul is being sucked away.  "Dave," says the monkey. "Dave Monkey." Taking the giant cigar in tiny hand he offers the other mitt to Chase for shaking.  "Pobs, ya dumb shit. Ya fergot yer key again." Compton announces when he gets there. Holding out a key with a large dangly keychain with a 1 7 4 printed on it. "Hi Dave..." and a less familiar "Hey" to Chase.  Attention still on Dave Monkey, Chase bends a tad at the knees to shake his hand. His thin lips still skewed in a modest boyish grin, finally he looks up from the speaking simian. "Pobble. Right, Penny says yer a 'fuckin' genius' to quote the broad." To Compton, his square jaw still in flex mode as it destroys his chewing gum further. "Oi." Yes, he recognizes Compton from one of the meetings, though he's never met him proper like. "'M Chase."  "Geni.." murmers the man. Apparently a lost cause. One hand, stained black in patches in the light and glistening slightly still holds the blue smoker at Chase, as if he'd forgotten he was proffering it. The end seems slightly stained with black against the blue.  "You will ave to excuse Dr Steve, e's a bit out of 'imself of late. He's lost something important." says Dave gesticulating at his companion. A solemn toke on the cigar follows, and the Monkey reaches into the immaculate suit pocket and retrives a crumpled ball of something. "Oi, Chase. I 'eard Penso talk about you. She wanted to give you a present." The monkey, with its bluest blue eyes, winks and offers the bundle.  Compton nods once, obviously fronting in front of the rather extreme personage of Chase, "Compton. Invisible College." and as if to prove his point, flicks out his pinky and thumb and circles them in the air a few times. Hang Loose. Then taps his left breast with his fore and index finger before passing a whole pack of smokes to Pobble, if he's with it enough to reciprocate.  "Eh?" Chase, distracted by the present offering monkey, again finds it impossible to pay attention to anything else. And duly, he reaches down to take the bundle and unbundle it. "What's this." It's a rhetorical question, because clearly he'll have figured it out by the time Dave can answer. That is, if by opening the bundle he'll have solved the enigma of Pen's present. While callused fingers go about opening the gift, he continues speaking. "Oi Compton. I'd thought you guys tried ta stay outta the 5th dimension, no?"  Compton frowns, and hangs his head slightly. Obviously shamed. "Yeah. Usually. Dip shit here forgot his keys again. We're trying to move and nobody's there. Peachy sent me to make sure god-boy doesn't freeze in an alley... I hate being in la-la land." funny Compton of all people should say that. But to totally undermine the point, takes a belt of his hooch.  The 'Gift' is apparently a pair of underwears. Used female underwears. The monkey grins, showing its teeth and then begins to stroll off towards the wall, waddling slightly and waving its cigar about.   Pobble ignores the proffered cigarettes, and maintains position on the burning down boomer. He says nothing.  Like the pincers claws belonging to salad tongs, Chase plucks the panties and allows the bundle to fall. Eyes squint, and look for the joke. A slight stain is all they find, no? For the span of 6.7 seconds, Chase, locked in a look of confusion, dangles the underwear before his eyes. Then, "What the shit..." Looking to Dave, then Pobs, then Compton, "What the shit..."  "They smell great don't they?" says Dave, nearing the wall. The tiny ape comes up to its base and knocks at it with his little knuckles. Sucking in more smoke, he blows it at the surface, watching it dissapate.  Compton looks at Pobble for another few seconds, as if to gauge what to do with him, only to be distracted by Chase and his prize. The brows go up, and the forehead crinkles, the mouth slackens and the eyes boggle. "Oh shit.... Dave? What *have* you done?" and quickly the bottle makes its way back to his lips and an extended draining ensues. *wheeze* "She'll fucking kill you Dave... she'll fucking kill all off us." is his frank assessment of the situation the tiny primate has landed us in. But, not to be thoughtless, Compton digs inside his big coat and pulls out a can of Coors. Rare to see up in these parts, and passes it to Chase. "Here man. Was nice knowing ya."  "I... yeeeeeah." Chase says, then suddenly, the SILVER BULLET! Ohhhh, Compton knows the back route to Chase's heart. Quickly, and still clutching the panties, the squat man reaches out for the beer. "Nice." He says with a good degree of thanks. It's snapped open and tilted into his lips. Must taste great with the synthetic watermelon flavored gum. A few healthy gulps, his mouth smacks when done. "Fuckin' tits man, how'd you know?" He's forgotten about panties and monkeys for the moment.  Chase says, "Listen, I gotta... I gotta go see this chica that's supposed ta come round my digs. You fuckers wanna join us? Got weed, got blow..."  Pobble still holds out the strange smelling smoke in Chase's direction. He hasn't moved, and while the stick has burned down its still longer than a regular cigarette. The man is glued to the void, tears rolling down his cheeks and a look of intense sadness on his face.  The monkey however, has grown bored with the wall. "I like tits me." he says, waddling back over. "Yeah, Chase. Penny was saying how she'd love it if you jumped her, made a move. Got stuck in. She's real shy yanno." Monkey makes an obscene gesture than seems even dirtier comming from the tiny critter. Dave seems to be doing the good thing, and also ignoring Dr Steve.  Not to be rude, Chase ohs and finally sees the smoke Pobble's offering him. Along with the panties, beer, and offers of Penny's cha-cha, Chase doesn't know what to do. Though smoking some of Pobble's shit does seem on the list. It's plucked from him and dragged upon before anyone can say anything.  "I didn't." deadpans the big guy. "It's just the cheap stuff the indians smuggle up." Comtpon then peers at Pobble, then answers for him, "Yeah, me and Rainman are in I guess." and then gloares at the monkey, "You *really* don't wanna live do ya?"  Dave L. Monkey points at the blue smoke, its grin widening. Afterall, Dr Steve only had one pull on the beast before passing it on and look at him. "Crack, smack and PCP. Don't let him drive." says the simian. "Wanker." he adds, probably to Chase.  Dave hops over to Pobble and pulls at the fur coat. "Steve you twat. Wake up."  Inside a barreled chest, Pobble's smoke lingers. Chase can take hits like nobody's business, and he doesn't say anything right away. No, he just allows the smoke (of whatever variety) to do it's magic inside his lungs. A nod to all three, monkey included, and he waves the trio along with callused hands. FInally, after the smoke's expelled, he speaks. "'S in Chinatown. I cin drive..."   Dave the Monkey has left. Pobble takes Dave the Monkey.  **Pause for station identification**  Derlict House - Kitchen    Beneath two stories, lies a basement with all the common amenities. However, it's been converted into a semi living space.   In one corner, a boiler and heater stand, though only function down here. The fuse box is also configured to power the subterranean portion of this structure. A washer drier are next, and a small makeshift sink. All four walls have been padded with heavy insulating material and wires run down from key holes in the ceiling. A few bundle are strapped together, feeding into a video network system. Four screens sit at a small square table, flashing camera feeds from strategic points outside and inside the house above. A reclining chair, made of brown leather, encircled with ashes and empty beer bottles on the hard cement floor. A TV sits atop another broken TV, it's wires arranged to split off the block's main cable system.    To the far wall, a long table has been set up, stacked with a variety of chemical compounds and mixing material. Everything from begin base liquids, to corrosive acids stored in chem-hazard tanks. A myriad mix of beakers, vials, and test-tubes line the shelves above. Gloves, goggles, tongs, all things a junior mad scientist would need to conquer the world. Some larger steel drums of chemicals are stored under the table, and some electronic chem-analysis equipment blinks an occasional red flash.   And finally, set along the length of the large basement, seems to be a make-shift firing range. Shell casings litter the floor at one end, opposite from a large reinforced steel door dimpled with a thousand bullet dents. The remains of a tattered paper target hang on the door. Over it, a picture of Ronald McDonald.    Contents: Chase  Pobble comes down the stairs. Pobble has arrived.  It's not a long drive in the Mustang, but it's punctuated by long bouts of silence under the blaring Cramps that Chase's system booms. That's where the money went.   With a small digital remote, the door's unlocked and alarm disabled. Chase is the first downstairs, the TV, stereo, and video feed react to his presence and light up. His thick frame meandering over to the fridge next to the lab table, he's still clutching the empty Coors can. "Whisky? Doritos?" He looks over his shoulder.  Compton peers around, clutching his security plunk, "Homey" the big guy deadpans.  "Wot he means to say is, that this place is a shithole." says Dave looking about. The monkey scampers past the three of you over to the chemicals and equipment for a gander. Dr Steve only moves when pushed in the right direction. His bloody hands now rest at his sides, and his face is slack as if he'd suffered a recent stroke on both sides, but his cheeks are still wet from crying.  Hepzibah comes down the stairs. Hepzibah has arrived.  A blinking red light above one of the video feeds heralds her arrival, Chase stiffens in reaction. He's standing by the fridge, holding a bottle of Bushmills and bag of Doritos looking at the feed. "She's on time, I like that."  Compton perks up and shuffles over towards Chase, "Whiskey." he says with the ernestness of a drowning sailor. "Got any coke for dopey?" he says jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Pobble, and turns to look at him, but sees Hepzibah and falls silent. He gets that caught look on his face and demeanour.  "Banannas?" asks Dave quietly, scampering about the gear. Dr Pobble stands by the door, facing a wall and apparently thoroughly engaged by it.  Hepzibah arrives at the bottom of the stairs and pauses to take in the room. Her hands are crammed in her pockets and she's chewing furiously on a wad of gum. She stares a bit. Eventually, she stops chewing and tucks the gum in her cheek. "So's this the right place, then?" she asks the room at large.  A Dorito is crunched up between Chase's stained teeth. They smile as Hep arrives in an inviting manner. Even if the speaking monkey and talk of blow doesn't seem so homey. "No bananas, sorry. Potassium extract though, in powdered form if ya dig..." Tiny bits of chips fly out his mouth as he says this, wiping his callused hands on his pants and approaching Hep. The bottle's handed to Compton. "Oi, Hepz..." Apparently, Chase forgot (or never knew) how to pronounce her name. "Hep, right? From Bob's crew? 'M   Dave monkey spins to look at Chase, "You saying I want Banannas? Fackin' insulting that. Takin' me for some kind of ape. I should fackin' eat your fackin' balls you twat." he seems quite miffed.  Hepzibah gives her gum a couple more half-hearted chomps, then spits it out. She holds it between her fingers gingerly and looks around, possibly for a suitably polite place to deposit the sticky mass. "Hepzibah. Hepsy. Hep. Depends on how much you like to hear yourself talk. Um.." She can't help but trail off and stare at the talking monkey. "Um...." she tries again.  Dave the Monkey points his cigar at the new arrival and says "Whotchoo looking at slag. Fack off issit?"  "That's Dave. 'N yeah, he's a talkin' monkey." Chase confirms and takes Hep's gum. It's flicked into the corner haphazardly. "Had the same reaction myself." A look back to the ape in question, Chase tries to be the good host. "Well what can I get you then, eh?" With that, he starts towards the lab table and reaches for a metal canister on one of the shelves. Before getting an answer back from the monkey, he continues to do his best at welcoming the new face. "You cin set up wherever... got a bed from upstairs I'll move down for ya."  "Move down. Good term, haveta remember that one.." says Dave turning to examine the setup once more.  Pobble stands near the door, watching paint dry. His hands twitch a little, and blood drips from a fingertip to splat down onto the floor.  Compton unscrews the cap of the bottle and sticks it in his pie whole. HE's trying to be inconspicuous, but his glum demeanour and size just make him look sinister standing there drinking 6 month old wiskey from the bottle.  Hepzibah takes an unconscious step back as the somewhat threatening monkey points the cigar at her. "Um, yes, I guess." she agrees vaguely. She stares some more in spite of this probably not being in her best interest. "Well, it's just..." she begins, then frowns. She's entirely forgotten about the gum. "I'm sorry. It's um... yes. Well."  "Eh, don't fret." Chase says back to Heps. "He won't..." Well then, how well does Chase know this monkey? Not very, it seems. "He -better- not fuck with yas." Bloodshot eyes squint a tad at the menacing ape as he opens the top of a metal canister. Some pink powder's poured onto the lab table. "Oi, Dave. How's about some nice tranq, eh? Scored it from a janitor that works at the city zoo. 'S what they use to calm the big cats down when too many gooks get in the park and start snapping away." Chase makes some gesture that could ether be associated with a camera, or a tank mounted 60 mm.   "Cheers mate, but no ta. I only take whats provided by the Doctor." The monkey indicates the coma victim in the corner. "S'the law." he adds, not even looking over at Chase, but still cataloguing the man's stuff.  Pobble turns away from the wall, eyes full of tears and heads over to find somewhere to sit. One finger seems to be clawing at his palms, causing a faint trail of blood droplets to form in his wake.  "Suit yerself." And Chase bends over to do a line of the offered traq. Rising again, he pinches his nostrils and is blinking manically. Though through it all, he spots the video feed again. Sounding funny and nasally, he says "Pen's 'ere." And with that, again hits his digital remote. Duly, there's a clinked sound at the top of the stairs and Chase approaches Hep again. "Heard about the place with the bomb 'n that. Nasty."  Chase shouts, "Come on down."  Penny comes down the stairs. Penny has arrived.  With the pre-emptive warning of the impending female arrival, the Monkey runs off behind the canisters as fast as its little legs will carry it. The cigar is dropped along the way and the monkey dissapears into the shadows.  Clump, clump.   Clump.        klack-klack-klack.  Quietly then "..fuck, Chase" and Penny's on her ass a few steps from the bottom, the stairs proving too difficult for her feet to navigate. She makes a big deal out of checking the soles of her sneakers, unwinding some odd variety of a/v cable from her ankles. With her other hand she pushed off the headphones that are still blaring some drum&bass.  She hasn't noticed Dave.  Pobble stands aimlessly in the middle of the space, one finger digging at his palm, dripping blood onto the floor. He's crying, staring straight ahead with a face otherwise void of expression.  Compton's head cranes around when Penny ‘walks in’. His eyes go real wide and his forehead crinkles up. He looks surprised; no scared. Next he gives a quick side long glance at the gansta monkey and then back and you can visibly see his adam's apple move up and down as he gulps. Yeah. Real cool under fire.  Hepzibah nods and pushes up her sleeve a bit to show a slightly pink patch near the wrist. "Yeah. I'm doing ridiculously well, considering it's only been a week and a half. Whatever they gave me for the burns and stuff worked wonders." She paces around the room inspecting the occupants and the paraphanalia with about equal interest. "They're not pissed at me, are they, Chase?"  "They must be, sent ya ta me, after all." The monkey's scampering feet draw Chase's attention back from the stairs and Hep. He walks towards the large plush leather chair and opens the flaps of his long jacket. Like a twisted Mr. Rogers, he goes about the task of disarming himself and getting a tad more comfy. Two Colts are plopped on the lab table, each banging slightly as metal meets metal. An eye to Pobble, then back to Compton. "Is he... is he cool?"  Compton takes his eyes off Penny for a second and glances at Chase, then to Pobble. He relaxes a little realizing how tense he was. "No, actually. He's fuckered." he answers. "The monkey says he's depressed about loosing god. Got any happy pills?"  Hepzibah seems genuinely concerned about this possibility. "Well it seems that way. I just wish they'd tell me what it's about. I mean, no offense to you or anything. I don't know you, right?" She comes to a stop a few feet away from Pobble. "Um, you alright there?" she asks hesitantly. "Your aura's wobbly."  She also hasn't gotten up but makes a peace sign at the stricken-looking pair of Pobble and Compton then alternately checking the inside of her coat. "Smoke me, who's she?"  Pobble's head snaps around in an unlikely motion. He fixes Hepzibah with a cold stare, and opens his mouth. It seems as tho he's bitten his tongue or cheek as blood begins to run over his lip and down onto his t-shirt. Face remaining slack except for a look of apparent hatred in his eyes. Its as if he goes to speak, but gurgles on the blood instead before turning away and slumping down into a chair, face first. Crying.  "Does the Pope shit in the woods?" Chase quips back to Compton and pulls out a small orange prescription pill bottle from one of his many pockets. A small yellow capsule is fingered out and held up for inspection. It features a painstakingly real bee painted in water soluble pigment. The cries get his attention again. Chase doesn't know what the fuck to make of them, but the pill's handed to Compton. "You feed 'm." Eyes up to Penny. "Right then. Intros. Penny.." a finger's pointed at her, "Hep. Compton. Pobble." And yes, they each get a point.  Well, Pobble is apparently not okay, but Hepsy seems a bit at a loss as to what to do about it. "Right then." She says, and continues her wandering, which takes her over in the general direction of Penny. "Hi. I'm Hepsy. I'm not quite sure what I'm doing here, but I expect it will all make sense shortly." she explains optimistically.  Compton nods and gives a very gruff "Hey" in response to Chase's name gaming. The stark fear he had a moment before tucked down deep inside again. He plods over and collects the Killer Bee from Chase and moves on to Pobble. "Hey Steveo," he says attempting to sound calming. He fails. It comes out more like someone trying to talk like 'Papa Bear'. "Got something for ya."  Penny's fingers wave and twitch over the offered pack. It takes an unusually long time for them to settle around a filter and after that, to pull it out and not break it in half. She slumps to the wall, gravity and habit doing the rest. Cig to lip and waits, lipping it to the corner of her mouth "Got a light, Hep?"  It can be said she has the same demeanor as Pobble; some unmoving, unflinching way of looking.  Still waiting for a light, she starts studying faces. Chase to Compton. Compton to Pobble. Pobble to Hepzibah. "The fuck is going on here, someone sell us out again?"  The sound of that voice stirs the crying Doctor. Pushing up from the chair, the blood and tears have made his face a mess and he fixes his gaze on Penny. The offering is taken from Compton without even looking at him and he dry swallows it before saying, "I need it back." Yes. A true Junkie.  What -is- going on here? Well, the monkey lurking in the shadows is gonna owe Chase, for one thing. As his 'gift' isn't going to be mentioned any time soon. Chase turns again to Hep, with high hopes for Pobble. Yellow-jackets don't usually let him down. "Give 'r a light then, girl." Eyes are fixed on her redder than red hair, he's in appraisal mode. "So then, i'll give you a tactical briefing later. In the meantime, hungry, thirsty? Want some a that zoomorphic traq?" Fingers reach up to rub harshly against one nostril, the pink powder still tickling the inside of his nasal cavity.  Hepzibah fishes around in a coat pocket. There's a fair bit of plastic and paper crinkling before she comes up with a lighter and tosses it to Penny. Good aim is not her strong suit, so hopefully Penny's good at catching things. "Um.. never had that before." She eyes the powder indecisively. "Normally I take valium, but.. looks interesting." she ventures.  "Good for what ailes ya toots." Compton deadpans as he plods back from where Pobble is sitting "Never look a gift drug in the mouth." Perhaps not the most inspiring rolemodel, there is a distinct feeling that there is a universal truth to his statements.  Hepzibah’s Desc          She obviously wants attention. Nobody who wants to blend in would dye her long, poker-straight hair bright, unnatural fire engine red and wear lipstick to match. The colour makes her pale complexion and blue-grey eyes look washed out like a faded photograph. Sizewise and shapewise, she looks pretty unremarkable.         She's wearing her heart on her sleeve, or at least her politics. Various patches and slogans decorate her scruffy army surplus coat, including a prominently displayed white-on-black anarchy symbol on the back. Her faded bluejeans look like they've been put through the dryer with a rabid mongoose, and her running shoes are partly held together with duct tape.                                  +view available  Penny says, in Enochian, "I can't, stuck to my synapses" the subtext 'shouldn't' and 'has reservations' ringing clear. She catches the lighter but it's obvious she was expecting to be lit. Obvious because her eyes roll and she snorts out, shaking the last of the audio cables off her feet. So guarded, speaking around the inhale and exhale "we're sharing, remember?" Penny shoots Pobble a look, a faraway not-in-front-of-these-fucking-people because she really can't get into it look. "Saw him in a dream. S'got designs on Jesse, next. Likes his digs, that place y'know."  Pobble screams, spraying a fine mist of blood into the air before storming past Penny and heading for the door and out. "Die fuckers, die." he calls as he slams the door behind him.  Penny looks up the stairs after Pobble.  "It was something I said."  Compton frowns as Pobble tears outta here. "Aww shit. Peachy's gonna have a bird..." Habitually he raises the bottle of Whiskey to his lips twice more before finishing with. "Fuck it." More to himself than anyone else. Audibly admitting his retirement from Pobble sitting.  "Eh, you'll dig it then. 'S valium to ...." About here is where Pobble screams and interrupts Chase's train of thought. Eyes rise and follow the abruptly leaving Pobble. Unsure. What the shit to make of him, but I'm hoping he didn't leave the monkey. "Ya. Umm... 's like valium." Chase explains and points towards the pink lines on his lab table which includes a snorting straw. He turns to the video feed to watch Pobble run off in horror. A small shake of his head. "I gotta piss." As he starts towards the reinforced door, he barrows the bottle from Compton for a swig. And gives it back of course.  Hepzibah tries to look like she knows what she's doing. She picks up the straw, aims it at some pink powder and inhales. The powder goes into the straw. So far so good. But she's a little thrown off by the way it feels in the back of her throat and starts coughing. She quickly turns her head away from the table and covers her mouth. Her eyes water as she tries to stifle it.  Compton grins like a wolf, "Good shit eh?" he asks the girl who's obviously in no condition to answer, "Here." he adds holding out the whiskey as a chaser.  Penny starts to get off her ass, elbowing the wall. She drags long and looks at Compton, then the stairs and the door Pobble just exited by. She puts a hand in her pocket, flicks the kill switch and the thumping bass finally stops. "Good. Good," to herself and maybe to the bathroom door. Surveying in paces, Penny walks around the lab "can't though," to Heps' invitation to dig on it "not my turn." Whatever that means.  Exhaling over the stacked televisions, Penny toys with the wires. "So you uh.. know Chase a while?" Whatever Hepzibah says, Penny eyes Compton for confirmation.  Hepzibah wipes the tears away with her sleeve and and accepts the whiskey gratefully. She makes a pained face as she downs some, then passes it back. Some coughing, sputtering, and wincing later, she gets her voice back. "Thanks... about three minutes, give or take." she rasps. Her lipstick is noticably smeared now. "Uh, what about you?"  Compton peers back over at Penny and his face tense's again. What is it with him tonight? To her question he takes a look at Hepz, then back to Penny with a shrug.  Compton says, in Enochian, "I know as much as you do Elohim."   Penny says, in Enochian, "Didn't your mother ever tell you not to do drugs with strange girls?"   Hepzibah makes some strained throat clearing noises as she tries to make some sense of what Compton and Penny aresaying and apparently fails. She sort of slides down the table leg and folds into a crouching position.  Compton looks over at Hepz again, after what Penny says. No, in fact leering would be a better word. "I've seen stranger looking girls. Besides it's Chase's shit and I'm just being supportive is all... ya don't see me doing it do ya?"  "How ya feeling little girl?" Compton asks Hepzibah.  Whatever Penny said, the tone's a little incredulous. It's a flat response, maybe a little ticked. Maybe, but that's all left to interpretation. She turns and leans on the tvs, lamppost-like. "Oh ages," her smile a friendly gesture. Placid like lake water, the eye of a hurricane "Chase, he's good people," nodding at the bug powder dust on the table, a tight little nod again at Compton "you're a lucky girl."  Zip, flush, and prince charming's back. Chase walks through the reinforced door palming the back of his head. "What 'append to that dude, anyways.." Probably Pobble. The soldier looks for answers, still pinching his nostrils and heading back to the leather chair.  Hepzibah sits on the floor and looks slightly bewilderd. "Uh, alright I guess?" she hazards anxiously. "I um...I'm still not sure *why* I'm here." she adds. "But the explanation can't be that far off, can it?" Her gaze locks on Chase as he comes back into the room and follows him to his chair.  +view hepzibah/patches A sampling of the patches on Hepzibah's coat includes:          -Everything- gives you cancer.         Save water. Drink urine.         Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity.         Just do it: Burn your Nikes.         Legalize It!           Saddam Hussien, Stalin, Hitler, all had mustaches.  Penny shrugs and tips off the tvs toward the bathroom, Penny has no answers. She's just decoration, shedding her coat and a wad of sterile, red-soaked bandage from her right side. Unhooking her bag for maybe the millionth time (this gesture looks easy - it is not, this is a complicated affair) she asides to Chase "Trash?" balling the gauze up in her hand "Gotta change this."  Chase says, "Yer here fer proper field training, Hep. 'M not a flake like Bob 'n his crew. No teenaged pipe bomb runs here, chica." Towards Compton, the thick man offers for his benefit. Ya know, just so everyone cin speak freely. "She's from a junior chapter of After-Math. Gonna get 'r nose wet up here."  He seems to be pacing the room slowly, the now almost empty bottle hanging limply from his finger, "Right. Fresh blood... young blood." Compton hits the word young oddly. "....allies." he finishes with his voice trailing off in a whiskey warble.  Hepzibah seems to take mild offense at the term 'teenaged pipe bomb runs.' She sniffs. Then again, maybe she's just not used to inhaling animal tranquilizers. "We had proper explosives. Would've been just fine if the Terminator guys didn't come out of the flowers." She frowns. That just doesn't sound right. "Not the sort of thing you can predict, you know? I tried to do a reading the night before, but none of it made any sense. Happens sometimes. Chalked it up to nerves."  "Ya, I know those robot fucks pretty well." Chase returns, slumping into the chair with a sigh and eyeing the bottle in Compton's grip. He does the 'gimme' motion towards it. "So Comp over here, he's parta something called the Invisible College. Dig they're style, even if I can't understand what the fuck they're up to half the time. Sos P-Diddy 'n the screamin' fruit that just ran outta here." fault."  Compton shambles back towards Chase hand haphazardly holds out the bottle for docking. Those born far enough back will recall images of the MiR/Soyuz collison in the early 90s, and this is a fitting memorial for that famous calamity. In his usual deadpan Compton adds to Chase's commentary on the College, "It’ not our fault."  Hepzibah says, "Invisible College." Nope, repeating it to herself doesn't make any more sense. "Yeah, Bob was saying... the terminator robot whatsits were like... um... " She reaches up and plucks the straw off the table, then uses it to draw little circles in the air. "Invisible. Not coming out of the flowers."  Copious vomiting. It's like listening to the Hoover Dam fall apart. Yak, flush. Yak, flush. Noisy, awful wretching underscores the conversation in the lab.  Then it stops and a subtle throbbing, distant headphone-echo starts to build up again. The door to the bathroom opens on rusty hinges and slams into the wall with a loud bang, Penny at her finest. Swiping spittle from her chin and cheek, her forehead is damp, t-shirts near to soaking and the red stain on her right has brightened, if anything. She toes the door open again before it can close on her face  "Yo Chase," she croaks, headphones vibrating around her neck "Band aids?"  Chase looks up from the leather chair, "Eh?" Bloodshot eyes look upon the wounded. "We talkin' Flinstones vitamins or field surgery?" A few inches forwards he leans, accepting the bottle from Compton and awaiting further info from bleedy over in the corner. Without wiping the top, he swigs. Clearly not afraid of germs.  Penny deadpans "Funny. Just big enough to cover," she turns away and the bathroom door gets propped open on her shoulder blades. Nimble fingers tug up the shirt where only she can see "bout three inches," her voice bouncing off the bathroom walls. "C'mon, it's making a mess'a me."  Chase stands from his plush chair, adjusting the straps to his kevlar vest and procures a small first aid kit cleverly stashed out of sight and under the lab. Why out of sight? No good reason it seems. At the lab table, he opens the tin and fingers out a few band aids. "Three inches? Need a stitch mebbe?"  Silvius slips into his Robes of Office and into Judge Mode!  Hepzibah chews on the end of the straw. "What happened to you anyway?" she calls in Penny's direction, morbid curiosity getting the better of her. She chews on the straw some more, grinding one end pretty thoroughly between her teeth.  Guess what ya don't do, ya don't go poking about the exterior of Chase's underground lab and sanctum. Especially not while he's home and has his ears on. It just so happens that Chase catches this on the feed and a snarl whips over his features. "Who the fuck's that." He's forgotten Penny's well being for the moment, instead opting to pick up the shotgun next to fridge and hand it to Compton. "'Ere." Regardless wether or not the man knows which end is which. A colt 45 in hand, and not the kind that Billy D. Williams promotes ether. Chase steps towards the video screens and hunches over to get a better look at this would be intruder.  It so happens, that on Chase's video feed from upstairs, you notice a person, male, decent size and build, poking about the exterior of the building.  The man on the feed looks rather non descript, other than the wide shoulders and perpetually irritated look on his face. He walks around from the side of the house to the front, and reaches out, trying the door.  Compton's eyes bug outta his head a bit and he staggers slightly from the sudden reactions of Chase - but his big mits grasp the barrell of the 22 gauge surely enough. With barely a thought he sticks the stock to his shoulder and chambers a round, and only then shoots a 'What the fuck?!' look over at Penny.  "Nah nah," rolling down her shirt before Chase gets around with the kit. "Just a ..can't stitch it. Chase? Comps?" Having ducked in momentarily, Penny comes out of the bathroom one more time with toiletpaper wadded up under her shirt. "Comps," she gestures with her free hand for the gun and makes the universal hand gesture for be-quiet.  Hepzibah ambles over to take a look at the monitor. "Never seen him." she contributes, trying to sound like she has at least half a clue, and might have a remote chance of recognizing a random intruder.  Looking up at the top of the stairs, Chase peels his gaze from the video feed and pulls out a small digital remote to go with his Colt 45. It's aimed at the door, the remote not the Colt, and beeped. With a few quick depressions of the button there, the door atop the stairs reacts with a solid locking mechanism. Having takin that precaution, his alert yet reddened eyes return to the feed. "Keep the heat on the door, Comp." He commands, moving quickly in business mode. This is where Chase thrives. But this dude, he's never seen before. So instead of looking like it's go time, he seems more curious than anything. "Mebbe a drifter..."  Compton gets a hurt look on his face at Penny's motions to disarm, and holds up one hand reassuringly to her before quietly plucking the other Colt from the bench and lobbing it towards Penny and then quickly sighting up on the door's center. Letting Penny to worry about the catching more than the throwing.  The man steps back quickly as the locks slip into place on the door as he tries it. His hand slips under his shirt at the back of his pants and pulls out a large handgun, possibly a Desert Eagle or similar. He moves to the side of the door slowly, as if expecting someone to emerge from the door. He makes no other motion, and glances at the other feeds shows that the man seems to be alone.  Hepzibah studies the monitor intently from far enough away that she's not blocking everyone else's view. She chews on the straw and gets red lipstick smears on it. Her eyes are big and wide and she seems a little bit stunned.  Well Chase can see him, that's a plus. Armed? That's to be expected. And they happen to be in Chase's sanctum, not a place you'd wanna fuck around. So, still idly holding the Colt, the narcotic soldier plucks something from the chem rack. It seems to be a blue bottle, containing a handful of blue pills. "Let's figure this out then." He says to no one in particular, and pops a pill. "Some back up, if you please Hep. Let's do this right." And in turn, a pill's handed to her.  Thus armed, because Penny's fucking athletic, she's got a bead on the door and one eye on the monitor when it counts. "Yeah," sarcastic "Cause a fucking drifter packs the biggest hand cannon on the market. How 'bout the competition? You got any? Doesn't look like one of those magic fucking ninjas..." she opines, advancing to the bottom of the stairs.  Hepzibah takes the blue pill in the palm of her hand and looks at it uncertainly. "Um what sort of backup? What is this?" she asks. She swallows the pill without waiting for an answer and glances over her shoulder at the stairs. The straw goes back between her teeth and she gnaws on it furiously.  "Fuckin' raw recruits." Chase snarls at Hep. "Just believe in what i'm doing, ok? Fuck..." Some head shaking, the thick man looks back to the feeds now as his jaw begins to gnash up the pill. It's turned into a messy blue powder rather quickly, and swallowed in short order. After this, eyes narrow upon the armed form, Chase's trigger finger gets itchy.  Compton licks his lips and jerks his head to one side flipping the Santa's cap over. He shakes his noggin a little trying to clear the whiskey, and squints one bloodshot eye closed.  Hepzibah holds her hands up defensively. "Ogay. Ogay." she agrees, speaking through her teeth with the straw sticking out of her mouth. She swallows a couple of times and looks back and forth between the door and the monitor and doesn't seem to have a clue what to expect. Her hands stay held up in front of her just incase of...surprises?  After a few moments of watching the screen, a dirty grin slinks over Chase's features and he rises. "A messenger." Stuffing the colt in his waist, he rubs furiously under his nose. "Watch the feed. 'M gonna go take care a this..." Another handful of pills are popped, Chase isn't taking his eyes off the man. More concentration.  The man still hasn't moved from the position next to the door, though the gun does lower a bit and he glances to the door, a look of indecision crossing his features.  There's a moment where Chase is watching the feed. And the next, well, he's just not there anymore. But, the door at the top the stairs is opened somehow, and promptly closed.  Hepzibah shifts anxiously from one foot to the other. Watching she can do, but it doesn't seem overly useful. She does a double-take when Chase disappears, but hey.. it makes as much sense as anything she's seen lately. She watches the feed as helpfully as possible.  She blinked and then he was gone. "Damn." Penny lowers the gun to her left and edges up the stairs, right shoulder first. Still dripping in splotches across the floor and steps, her blood mingles with the dirt and grime underfoot. One step at a time, Penny gets about halfway up and retrains the gun on the door.  Compton lowers the barrel of the gun and pushes the Santa cap back on his head and wipes the sweat from his brow.  And on the feed, Mr. Intruder looks pensive still, and steadfast in his ready position. But there, on the screen, in the corner, is Chase approaching with his Colt in one hand. One would guess that the man would -have- to hear or see the thick man's approach. But no. There's nothing. In fact, Chase get's within /inches/ of the man before casually pointing the 45. barrel at the back of his cranium. Over the audio feed, you hear, "Drop the gun 'n letter, or you're aces cabrone." And truly, with the barrel poking his skull, there'd be no chance for this man to escape sans bullet hole.  Hepzibah is clearly quite fascinated. Chase seems to have the situation in hand, so she quits worrying about being useful and just watches things unfold and chews on the plastic straw.  Compton clicks the safety back on the shotgun and puts it down on the bench, before shuffling off to the fridge and rummaging around inside.  The unnamed man blinks and jumps a bit, gun raising quickly but then stopping as he feels the barrel to his skull. He sighs a bit and shakes his head an inch or so. The reply is one in a voice heavy with a spanish accent, "No can do Amigo... Unless you the right man.. You kill me boss kills me, makes no difference if I give to you and you wrong."  Penny remains there on the stairs, gun pointed at the door. "Comps, got another smoke?" Hasn't budged an inch and isn't likely to. Clicks her tongue against her teeth "What kinda messenger says no..."  A moment later "..obviously not one that wants to live."  Still with his bitch painted on the back of the man's skull, Chase switches over into some Spanish. Which I will translate here for everyone's sake. "You lookin' for Chase? You found him." The 45. cocks, and the hammer pulls back. "You lookin' ta get yer head fucked open, you keep ignoring the puto with the gun to yer head. Now, drop yer piece and leave the letter on the ground. Last time..." 'S like watching a real TV show, video screen 'n all. Only, this one's for reals, and filming right outside.  Hepzibah eventually finds something relevant to say. She demonstrates her mastery of the blatantly obvious. "Guy's got a lousy job." she remarks. It doesn't sound like she has a huge amount of sympathy for him, though.  Compton's head pops back out of the fridge, the pompom on the hat flipping around moronically, "Yeah, somewhere. Gimme a sec." and the closes the door with two beers in his hand and starts to pat down his parka with the other one looking for the square lump. Finding it he extracts two smokes and makes his way over to the stairs, stopping by Hapzbah to make a 'Got a light?' hand motion.  The man then nods slowly, his knees bending as he very slowly reaches the gun towards the ground. His other hands reaches into his back pocket, slowly as well, to give the man behind him no reason to pull the trigger. "Hey man, it's all cool, si? Just had to be sure, ya know." He sets the envelope and the desert eagle on the ground at his feet and starts to straighten again, "Now I just walk away right?"  "Scoot." The gun's lifted from the man's skull, Chase allows a peaceful retreat. And soon, it's just the thick soldier on screen. The Desert Eagle's grabbed, as is the letter, and soon Chase is on his way back inside without any shots fired.  Hepzibah doesn't notice Compton's gesture. She's way too new to this to be blase, and a couple people who want to smoke cigarettes don't even register while there are brand new loopholes in the laws of physics and a couple of guys with guns to consider. She sucks on the flattened end of the straw and watches owlishly.  Besides, Hep's lighter is in the pile of jacket Penny left on the floor. Eyes in the back of her head, Penny would say something but the audio's come back to life again. Out there it sounds pretty tense; doesn't want to fuck it up. Under her breath, Penny mumurs "..wrong answer, heffe.."  In through the door and down the stairs, Chase is unfolding a letter and stuffing a 50. Cal hand cannon in his waistline. "Can't fuckin' believe someone knows where the shit I live." And that, more than anything, has him -pissed-. He reaches the bottom of the stairs and walks towards the lab, eyes still downcast.  Compton rolls his eyes at the young'in and her excitement at the promise of violence and moves on, beers clinking as he moves across the space. Reaching Penny, he offer both smokes up. "Sorry, no light." and gazes to where Penny is so intent on.  (SPISH) A beer opens.  Compton has the beer out for Chase without a word. Shortly there after opening the second one and nipping in.  Or maybe it was in her backpocket. Lighter mechanics.. y'never know. She looks up to the door again, clicks the safety back on and tucks the gun into the small of her back. Gets lit and teeths the cigarette enough so she can exhale and talk around it. She presses herself against the wall, casually looking over Chase's shoulder as he walks downstairs. "S'bullshit is what that is."  A muchly deserved beer from Compton, "Gracias." Chase thanks and pulls from the cold treat.  Hepzibah turns around to look at the real live Chase coming down the stairs. Her expression is brimming full of questions, but she manages to squelch them for the time being. She rocks back and forth between her heels and her toes and accidentally flicks the straw across the room.  "Eh. Wonder how he found ma ass." Chase says, having absorbed the letter's contents in a single gulp. Beer wielding hand rubs his nose again, lazy eyes look at his three compadres. "Gun dealer." That's offered in explanation, and the thick man returns to his spot on the plush leather chair. "Been pokin' into his gig, guess he found that shite out. Good lookin' out though, cabrones. Ya'll 'r regular Johnny's on the spot."  Compton grins proudly that his little display of macho-killerness was so convincing. "The College is 'ere for ya is what Jesse says. So we're here for ya. Is all good." he croons on confidently. Yeh. Holding that big gun in his hands fulfilled some need in Compton that he's riding high on now.  Penny drags long and exhales something quiet under her breath. She stays in the region of the stairwell, talking to herself. Her right hand has returned to the drenched toiletpaper sticking to skin and shirt, starts plucking it out one soggy square at a time. "De nada, man" pasting on a smile for everyone's benefit "we're all alike."  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Silvius at diff 5.          For a total of 2 success(es).  Long distance to Silvius: Penny is gonna roll arete diff 5 and get a spirit to do some recon with the messenger. Kay? Silvius pages: okay. Silvius pages: having it follow him? You paged Silvius with 'Yep. Will tell me who he's taking orders from.'. Silvius pages: penny okay, he walks a few blocks and gets in a car, then he drives to Little Italy, to Botticelli's Ristorante. He steps up to a man eating there alone, dressed in a very expensive, tailored suit. Man looks to be in his late 50's early 60's. He tells him how the scene went. The man isn't pleased about the gun being left behind but nods and dismisses the messenger with a wave of his hand.  [Ed Note: This, of course, is not what I asked for. But hey..]  "Right then. Let's see that cut, P." A finger wags at her, Chase has set aside the letter and is holding the band aids he procured for her before they were interrupted. The protective paper strip is peeled, and his callused hands prepare the wound closer.   Hepzibah twists a long lock of unnatural red hair between her fingers. "If you say so." she mumbles. She brushes the end of the hair over her cheek as she toys with it. She settles back down cross legged at the base of the table and looks at everyone like she's Alice in Wonderland and they're hookah smoking catterpillars.  Penny tugs the gun out and lays it on the table. "Got feelers out," sucking in, her hand scrapes off the rest of the tp into a garbage can. Heavy, wet noise in the plastic liner. "..keep you posted. I gotta get cleaned up. Hey," she adds almost as an after-thought, nodding at the gun on the table "you wanna let me hang on to that? Just in case he's like.. down the block'r somethin'?"  That's our Penny, as coy as she is polite.  "Eh." A glance back to the Colt. "Eh, go 'head I guess." Though Chase is still holding the band-aids, and offers them over with insistence. "But here, fuckin' plug that hole. Pobs bled enough on the damn floor, don't need this place lookin' like Fred Krueger lives down here. Now that I gots a roommate 'n all." A brief glance towards Hepsy, wonder what she makes of all this. Her relative silence speaks loud enough though. Silvius has left.  Compton stands idly by watching Chase's feild triage sipping at his beer. "So, um... what's with the hole anyways Pens? You pickin holes in yerself like Doc?"  Penny retucks the piece and begs off the band aids. "He says he's terribly sorry about the mess and wishes it could be otherwise but it's a limitation of the vessel."  Right. Just a smidgen off her game, Penny looks to Compton and to Hepzibah "I gotta go," some edge of hysterial tilting her voice to the higher end of the scale. She takes off almost as fast as Pobble did. Only minus the screaming and vulgar language.  Hepzibah attempts humour. Sort of. She laughs nervously. "Uh..as long as he doesn't really live down here, it's all good." she says. The lock of hair that she's twirling is smooth and shiny from the attention.  Chase is all about checkin' this gun boy. After handing over the band-aids, his cell phone is pulled out. "Via con dios, P." To the retreating girl. "Oh..." A beeping sound and the door's open. "Now then, let's see what kinda game this fucker's runnin'..." And his fingers go about punching in a number.  Compton shrugs at Penny, puts down the beer and starts doing up his parka. He makes to go too. But far less hasty then God-lady. "Well, was a slice guys. Thanks for the beer." he says cordially on his way. Penny goes up the stairs.  Chase says, "Adios Compton. Thanks cabrone..." Chase picks up his cellular phone and begins to dial.  Compton winks a final acknowledgement. That crossed with the grimey Santa's cap makes for a disturbing image. And he's gone too.   You go up the stairs. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Penny comes up the stairs. Derelict Home - Main Room You leave the derelict house. Chinatown Side Street       The buildings are too closely spaced together here. The first few buildings are businesses, spilling over from the busy street beyond. Then the buildings settle down to being residences. Many are old and rundown. Most are crowded close enough together to be termed shutgun houses. However, a few here and there are more elegant, remnants of an earlier time.

Long distance to Cassius: Penny is looking for James. Feel like witnessing a spirit roll to send some out a'huntin' for me?  You walk south along Jarvis to College. Downtown - Jarvis and College E(#128RJ) You walk under the archway and enter the gardens. Allan Gardens(#6048RIJM)       Verdant manicured lawns stretch out on either side of a wide sweeping walk way the leads you into Allan Park. A large circular fountain dominates the view as you approach the Conservatory.      Low concrete benches surround the shallow marble lined basin where one may sit and watch the bright red and orange Koi swim in and out of the lily pads and underwater plants that festoon the clear water. Copper and silver coins glisten beneath the calm waters, tokens to the gods of good fortune from the small children and wistful lovers who pray for favor over their offering.      Ahead gleams the ornately crafted Conservatory where the collection of tropical flora from Madagascar is tended, considered to be one of the finest in the country. And to either side you notice walkways that lead through out the formal gardens.                           Place code is in effect here                             You paged Cassius with 'Maybe?'.

From afar, Cassius grins. Hmmm... Cassius pages: Alrighty. Give me a roll. Where are you calling for a spirit? Cassius pages: And give me a PAT first, it'll help determine the spirit. ;) Chase steps in from the steet and heads into the gardens.  Chase has arrived. Chase enters the conservatory Chase has left.  'Phenomenon - Penny's sitting on a bench in the garden outside the Realm. She takes out her cellphone (foci) and dials.

Downtown - Jarvis and College E(#128RJ)  [And a short time later...]  You walk west along Bloor to Bay. Downtown - Bay and Bloor W(#224RJ)       This bustling intersection is a constant hub of activity. Stores of all ranges pack the streets, and pedestrians flock to all of them. An office tower currently occupied by the Bank of Montreal with shops and stores on the ground level is known as the Manulife Centre. Other major stores include Holt Renfew, a department store selling only high-priced brand-named goods like Armani, Harry Rosen and Christian Dior; Bay Bloor Radio, a large discount store specializing in electronic goods, and the Bloor Street Diner, a yuppie bar and eatery. Bloor and Bay is one of the hearts of the after-hours hangouts. Yuppies nestle themselves into snotty bars while those of lower incomes pack into pubs and eateries. This is an area of influential, high-powered business mixed in with high-retail commercial. Pure white sidewalks are here, with the freshly paved road now deprived of pot holes as the beautification has come through here as well. Pleasant flowers in planters line the streets and small trees rest in their own holders at various points along the street.  Contents: Ted Reeves Ryan Reeves Mick  Ryan Reeves is apparently waiting at a red light in an old blue-green Chevy. Hurrah for obeying the law!  Mick Is chilling in a grey government sedan, finishing a sandwich and a cellphone call at the same time.  The chevy's backup lights flare into the night as he inches backward from the red to line h is car up next to the governmental sedan. He then comes to a complete stop while keeping the engine running.  Ted Reeves is riding shotgun with his head out the window smelling the air. Hurrah!  Penny j-walks through the middle of the street, headphones on, collar flapping in the tumultuous winds. She isn't paying much attention, the world going on around her. Busy looking at a cellphone screen.  Mick flips a bird to the world in General "  Mick flips a bird to the world in General, muttering to himself "Im a friggin Federal Employee, I don't chase speeders....Jesus H Christ"  Ted Reeves motions for Mick to roll down his window and then he says in a british accent, "Pardon me sir, but do you have any grey poupon?"  Ryan amuses himself by watching the woman cross the street. Respectfully, of course.  Mick shrugs and waves his sandwich, "Nah...I got plain old frenches yellow," he adds as a rather inneffective comeback "I got a Remington 870 in the trunk?"  Hennessey arrives from the west. Hennessey has arrived.  She gains the curb on the opposite side of the street without incident; nobody deliberately tried to mow her down - mostly they just slowed or she kept the right pace to traverse bumpers. Passing by the groups of people spilling out into the street, Penny slows on occassion to look from the phone up to doors. She stands back more than once, looking for numbers across the doors. Numbers and faces; looking into the faces of people she might know, doesn't know, will know in the future. Her headphones describe a false distance between her approaching these people, keeps her on that side of the glass and wall-eyed she keeps walking.  Ryan Reeves is apparently pulled up beside a government Sedan in his own blue-green Chevy.  Ryan gazes at Penny as Ted talks to whoever's in the sedan.  Ted Reeves gives Mick a confused look, "How do you change you're tires with Remington?  Mick hangs up his cellphone, conversation apparently finished and grunts "Very Carefully, Very Carefully"  Ted Reeves snorts in a british accent to Mick, "No grey poupon!? How uncivilized!"  Ryan casually leans back in his seat, apparently not going anywhere. He withdraws a cigarette from a jacket pocket before he alerts Ted, "I think he and the Miss's are picking up soliciters."  Mick asks the guy across from him "No, we aint picking up Johns," then he looks the pair in the Chevy over and asks "Hey, aint you that reporter guy?"  Hennessey crawls through the start-and stop of traffic. Shows must be just getting out or something. She yawns.  Penny holds her phone up to the next awning, counting silently to herself, nodding her head up and down. Up and down. Down down, bamp bamp. She finds her groove and knocks it around, shivering terribly.  The things we do for love or money. Suffering outrageous conditions, Penny glances downat her shoes? at something lower than eye-level and shoves her way past a heaving debutant faster now.  Ted Reeves switchs from a british accent to his patented southern accent and says to Mick, "Well, I'll be damned. If we's a re-port-ers, then I'll bet that your a mountie... Eatin' a sandwich with no grey poupon, that is."  Ryan sighs, apparently allowing Ted to handle whatever questions are asked. He instead leans out the car window and makes a motion toward Penny as if beckoning her to approach.  Millia arrives from the south. Millia has arrived.  Ryan is apparently sitting in the driver's seat of a blue-green chevy which is pulled alongside a sedan.  Mick says "Yeah, Im a mountme, you want a leak or not?"  Hennessey crawls through traffic in a dark blue little Audi sedan... the live-parked Chevy isn't helping, of course, but then again, maybe it's important.  Ted Reeves pats Ryan's shoulder, "He's giving us info! Screw the streetwalker." He turns back to Mick and says, "So, Federal employee what do you know?"  Mick says "Well, I don't wanna talk outa school, got a place you like to drink beer at?"  Penny wasn't looking at the gesturing Ryan; she was concentrating on her phone. It was only the after-image, the missing motion of a stopped hand that catches her wide eyed and staring. Blue, gloveless hands refold inside the jacket as she tucks away her phone and approaches the truck.  "Yeah?" One syllable, multiple interpretations.  Late evening or not, Millia seems to still be speaking to people. She walks about the streets, handing out buttons as she speaks to people along the way.  Ryan gives Ted a slight frown before he says, "She looks cold." He then gazes at the woman who has approached and asks, "It's a bit late to be wandering the winter streets, isn't it? Can I give you a ride somewhere, madam?"  //.etro: It is 9:53 pm, late evening, on Saturday the 10. day of January, 2009.  Coming closer to the group, the reporters should recognize Millia, now. She's one of the two candidates running in the city council election. She smiles at the two of you, "Thanks for the offer, I might take you up on that."  Ted Reeves looks at Ryan and shakes his head, "Hey cop, I'll go drink a beer with you. My brother has his eyes on other things right now."   Mick nods "Sure thing dude, hop in?" he eyes the brother and says "Let ol' boy get to gettin?"  Ted Reeves jumps out of the old chevy and into the Govt sedan.  Mick fires up his car and pulls out of the parking place, zipping down the street for buisness and beer.  Ryan shakes his head slowly before offering Millia a smile as well. He seems to have been addressing the previous question to Penny, but he decides either woman looks cold.  Mick walks west along Bloor to University. Mick has left. Ted Reeves walks west along Bloor to University. Ted Reeves has left.  Maybe she was about to speak up but hey, Penny knows how to let things move along. And she goes with the flow, passing by Millia in just a few quick steps without a backward glance. Everyone near Penny has buttons and a few of them try to pass some her way, touching her elbows, pinching at her jacket.  Hennessey pulls out behind the sedan. Well, at last, traffic's moving.. Hennessey walks west along Bloor to University. Hennessey has left.  Ryan frowns as Penny begins to walk away, but he does address Millia as he asks, "So, things look to be pretty much in order here. Did you want a ride somewhere?" Yep, Ryan seems to be running the blue-green taxi service as of late.  Millia looks at Penny as she passes by her, a hint of recognition on her face, but that is gone almost as quickly as it appears. She nods towards Ryan, "Sure, I'm pretty much done here."  Penny says, in Latin, "DON'T TOUCH ME!" shouting at these drunks, these wastrels, these her brethren. Penny shrieks and flinches away from the button brigade. She holds up her hands, pushing at the air, shielding her eyes from the wind "STOP" swiping at invisible hands trying to plant these electoral seeds in her pockets and palms.  Ryan nods to Millia, motioning toward the now empty passenger's seat as he says with a sly smirk, "Hop on in. You're lucky, Ted usually doesn't give up the shotgun position without a duel."  Millia chuckles softly, and like her voice, there is something light and musical about it, "I think I've run into your brother, but I can't pin where." She then wanders around to the passenger side of the chevy and climbs in.  The shouting seems to do the trick, sends the hip and youthful guerilla campaigners on their way to other streets and other bars where their efforts won't be rebuffed. Penny, winded, puts a hand out to a white-painted pole. Leaning there only a moment, her handprint remains in a red stain as she limps on.  Ryan nods before commenting, "Probably, he does seem to know everyone in the city." Ryan points in Penny's direction before commenting, "Well, besides her." He wences at Penny's shouting, a slightly concerned look crossing his face before he accelerates and pulls up alongside the woman. "Um...did you want a ride as well, miss? You seem a bit upset and lost," Ryan says before he adds, "And...um...wounded."  Ryan gazes at Penny for perhaps a moment too long after he asks the question before finally blinking once again. In all, it looks to be the appraising type of gaze reporters often give when trying to size someone up as a potential story.  Millia gets a look of worry across her features looking at the handprint. From the vehicle a soft humming is heard, as she takes hold of her pendant.  Millia actually steps out of the vehicle, moving towards Penny, "Are you alright? What happened?"  The headphones tilt and slide off her head "Get away from me," taking it personally while the truck rolls slow enough to keep her pace, harsh and heavy words issuing forth "you're a mark, we're not supposed to talk." She stops suddenly, an equally estimating eye fixed on Ryan "What'd he want you messed up for anyway. You have a little too much fun in the Boom Boom room?" On second thought, this really isn't the time. Resorting to duck and cover, Penny tries to keep moving through the crowd.  From afar, Millia wants to do a lifescan on Penny, to see where she is hurt. Millia pages: Would you like me to contact staff, or would you let me roll it to you? You paged Millia with 'You can roll but I'll tell you - she's got a wound in her abdomen.'.  Ryan moves to slowly keep up with Penny, his vehicle inching forward. He doesn't appear to be too upset with the woman despite whatever it is she's going on about, instead offering a (what he hopes to be) disarming smile as he responds, "I assure you, I am not that type of man. I've only been in there once and that was for a friend's eighteenth birthday party."  From afar, Millia is trying to remember if I'd rped with you before or not, I've talked with the rest of the Invisible College.. Long distance to Millia: Penny nopes.  Moving as slow as it was, Millia showed she had some atlethcism when she steps out of the truck. She walks rather quickly to intercept Penny, "Please, ma'am, let me look at that, I am medically trained a bit."  From afar, Millia nods, Okay...no mentioning the rest of the college to try and stop then.  The shouting taunts and Penny can't stop herself, evading Millia with a few quick feints, a dodge to the left and she's back at the truck's window. Her hand grips the mirror like she's about to take off again "Y'see like a nice guy, you're not 'cause you're a reporter and I know better, but you seem nice." Some threads of genuine concern, something else wrinkling her forehead "Okay? You just.. seem .. nice," warning you off, Penny starts to take off again.  Millia keeps in step with Penny rather well. She steps just beside the other woman, glancing at the her abdomen, pinpointing the wound quickly, "What happened to you?" Her voice is full of concern.  Ryan offers a slight smile as he answers, "And you seem to be cold, madam." He continues to follow alongside Penny, ignoring the traffic that passes around him as he moves. "You know you have absolutely nothing to fear from me. Why don't you let her see to your wounds, madam?" Ryan makes a motion toward Millia as he pulls to a stop once again, casually exitting the driver's seat in a graceful motion.  Penny looks over her shoulder, passing by panhandlers, people turning out papers, trucking out the hopelessly drunk. Blood passes from Penny to those stumbling in her path, dotting them. She looks over her shoulder and sees the unwelcome entourage, stung by the vision and spurred on like there's a whip across her back. "Go away, ..said it'll only get frostbit. Just fuck off, okay?"  Ryan sighs as he withdraws a cellphone from a trenchcoat pocket. He, of course, keeps after Penny, red trenchcoat swirling dramatically about him as he dodges passerbyers rather deftly. "Listen, madam, if you do not stop I will be forced to call an ambulance and possibly the police as your safety outweighs any dislike that you may bear for me afterwards."  So she stops. And waits for Ryan to catch up. She, too, reaches into her pocket and tugs out a cellphone, a calm composing her suddenlyvery still "Got one, too. Anyone can call the cops. Do you have a point? People can bleed if they want to." Close up you can see her shoulders slump a little and her skin's a little silvery - damp. "G.. " gutteral noise, unfinished in a sneeze, more substance issuing out "..you wanna be a hero? Save her election," nodding up to Millia "don't do me any favors. It's nothing you'd understand."  "I don't want to be a hero," Ryan responds softly before adding, "I just don't wanna see a woman die before me." And, with a deft motion and turn, Ryan removes his trenchcoat and tosses it toward Penny as he turns to leave. "Do me a favor, don't freeze to death," Ryan says as he doesn't even bother to watch whether Penny catches the trenchcoat or not. As he makes a motion for Millia to follow him back to his chevy, Ryan adds presumably for Penny, "Tell him he has my appologies for whatever perceived insults he's suffered and is free to have me roughed up at any time, but that I would ask he lay off injuring women."  Connelly has arrived. Connelly walks in in her heavy winter jacket as she is heading towards the bank...(OOC OK..now can someone set the scene for me?)  Ryan Reeves is wandering toward a blue-green chevy, presumably to get out of the rather cold weather. He occassionally glances in Millia's direction as if to be sure she's following. "Please miss, you're going to pass out soon if that wound isn't treated," Millia says to Penny who seems to be running away from her, while Ryan climbs into a truck parked nearby.  Penny catches the trench tossed in her off-hand. But Ryan's walking away; too fast for Penny to throw it back at him. Hey, free coat. She wanders off, but not before responding "You don't know shit about and God says you're gonna lose."  Millia sighs shaking her head, but after saying that, she does follow Ryan towards his vehicle.  You walk east along Bloor to Yonge. Downtown - Yonge and Bloor(#110RJ) You walk down the stairs into the subway tunnels, pay your ticket and approach the subway platform. Subway - Yonge/Bloor Station From afar, Millia chuckles, talk to Connelly before you run outta her. Long distance to Millia: Penny is long gone.  Penny takes a subway bound for college. You board the subway for COLLEGE. Subway - College Station You enter the lobby area of the Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn(#2848RnAJ) You enter the apartment.

      Pandora's Box - Pool Hall       The ceiling is set high with churning metal fans. The blades churn a thick haze of smoke from cheap cigars and the pungent aroma of sweat mixed with stale spilt beer. The bar runs the length of the far wall much like a saloon in an old western. A polished brass foot-rail gleams in the fading light of the occasional dropped match and guttering cigarette butt.       Many of the patrons watch each other with looks of a cautious calculation. Not only are those opposite the pool table viewed with suspicion, but also the few one might mistake as a friend. A darkness of nefarious deed reigns within the shadows as the lighting illuminates from the mouth down. It is as though the dark conspires to hide the intent deep within the eyes from the light of revelation. Then again the windows to these souls only come up black.                                   NIGHTZONE                                      Contents: Hana Tasha Jesse Pool Table Chuck  Hiro opens the door and walks into the pool hall. Hiro has arrived.  Hana sits at the bar, just receiving what might be a screwdriver from the bartender.  Compton stomps in. Heavy Parka drawn up about his head and his boots are leaving slushy prints behind him. Under his arm is tucked a long leather case and behind him is the walking freak show of Hiro.  A pool hall is not the kind of place for someone like Hiro to hang out. At least, not while wearing a plaid skirt and fuzzy cat ears. Hiro can be spotted loitering somewhere behind Compton and to his left, fumbling with the cellophane around a pack of cigarettes.  Hiro’s desc: Bad posture is to blame for Hiro's diminutive presence: with shoulders slumped, he cruises closer to 5'6 than his modest 5'9. The polite might refer to him as 'big boned' or 'chubby': the fact remains, however, that he simply looks like a pig. Short, tousled black hair, a plain face that edges towards the porcine, and silent, placid brown eyes distorted to largeness by corrective lenses. His double-helix bears the tags of half a dozen southeast asian cultures, with a smattering of anglo-mutt thrown in on this side of the pacific.  There is only one thing in this world more distressing than a convention geek, and that is a convention geek in drag. Put sailor moon and trinity in the same blender, with a healthy helping of geek, and this is the bleak result.  A dead-black jacket of some synthetic material reminiscent of kevlar: high collar, long sleeved, and designed -- obviously -- for the female form. The logo, stencilled across the back, is a yellow and black 'electric hazard' symbol: paired with the slogan: "NO CONTACT". The collar, however, is broad enough to reveal the sailor's blouse beneath, along with the red necktie tied in an elaborate bow. His skirt is just shy of knee-length, checkered green and black plaid, and -- despite the knee-socks -- neatly reveals the fact that he has failed to shave for this role. The patent leather mary jane shoes almost top it all off.  Discounting the furry cat ears.  Jesse, on his stool, turns lazily to the door as it opens. Compton's bulk, encased though it may be in a parka, is given a nod and a tug of his hat brim. Then, when the porcine satellite orbits out of eclipse, Jesse snorts. Beer is spat, and his choke is mostly laugh, though a halfhearted attempt is made, mostly for decorum's sake, to turn its end into a cough.  "E Rock." Another cough. "'ro." He sniffs. "Nice Judy."  Tasha opens the door and walks out onto the stoop. Tasha has left.  Compton stops and doffs his hood back and glares at Hiro, "Don't get us kicked out, I wanna actually play some pool this time, and um... yer lopsided."  Hana says something long in a language you don't understand.   Hana lazily looks over her shoulder, already narrow Asian eyes narrowing half a stop more. Her lips suddenly form a pearl-showing smile and, as if she's biting off the words-- She says something short in a language you don't understand.  rare to see this girl mirthful; no small thing, her laughing.  A moment's pause; Hiro squints nastily at Compton, and idly adjusts the tilt of his faux-breasts. They were, in fact, lopsided. "Eat shit and die," he replies, to both greeting and admonition. Cellophane crumples idly in his fist.  Jesse's thumb and pinky splay out, tracing circles in the air. Hang loose, he gestures. Then he taps two fingers over his heart. "'ro. Sport me a square." He glances at Hana, and shrugs with a faint grin. "It's his medication. All that television. Youth of today. What kind of messages are we sending to our children? Return to old time values. Trickle down morality. Prayer in cartoons."  Compton in almost mindless motions done to the point of trance, Compton flashes a peace sign and taps his left breast with two fingers.  A flashed V of index and middle fingers in Jesse's direction -- that's just too much -- and Hiro taps a cigarette out of the pack, offering it between the same two. "Keene cheated," is his explanation -- for what? -- as he slumps onto a barstool. "Nobody said we were allowed to cheat."  Well, Hana is cheered for the night. She looks at Jesse, still smiling. She's the kind of girl who's a pretty bitch, but even better when smiling. She rests her elbows on the bar.  Hiro takes a seat at the barstools. Hiro joins you.  The stool complains loudly as Compton deposits his ass on it, "Suck it up sissy. Cheating is always allowed. What good would the rules be if it wasn't." and shrugs out of his coat and tucks the case under the bar, "Hey JT. Whatcha cock?". The last part in a horribly fake cockney accent.  "Monkey came through with some weird DMT analogue bonded to knockoff oxides." The film canister from his satchel is removed once more and slid down the bar. "The oxides dehydrate you something fucking awful, though." Jesse wags his beer side to side.  Jesse stands, frowning, and sets the beer down. Without a word, and rubbing at the side of his head, he wanders towards the bathroom.  Hana, after a moment, slowly turns to look more closely at Hiro. Maybe something's caught her ears, because it's not her eyes that are so curious anymore.  A narrow sideways look at the film canister; Hiro tugs his own cigarette free from the pack, fits it between his lips, and lights it in a distinctly unladylike manner. Women tuck their elbow in when they light a cigarette. He needs to work on his schtick, obviously.  Compton peers at the film can for a few seconds like it's a landmine he just stepped on. Slowly he turns it over and pry’s the two halves apart an inch and peers inside.  Compton smirks at what he's found. A youthful twinkle in the old guys’ eyes. He looks over at Hiro and beams, "Gimme yer smokes Stince, and order me a rye. Yer gonna love this."  Hana turns her back to the bar, tearing her gaze off Hiro at the same time. A couple of drunks play pool nearby, and she watches them, without actually paying attention. Her mirth is gone, once again.  The packet of cigarettes was set down on the bar; Hiro offhandedly swats them down to Compton. "Why the hell are we in this shithole, anyway?" he asks.  "Maybe being gangraped was part of the bet," Hana says, apparently to Hiro, though she's looking another way.  "Jesse." Compton grumbles back, "He’s got shit and you need to get out more. Kenne has me on orders to get you laid, so..." swivels on his stool and makes a grand gesture to the room at large, "We come to where the skank lies in ambush." That said he turns back to his tin can and the pack of cigarettes.  "I'm not going to get laid dressed like sailor sasquatch," mumbles Hiro, pointedly ignoring Hana's unpleasant commentary. He hits on his cigarette.  Hana glances briefly at Compton, again at Hiro, and thankfully doesn't comment this time.  Opening the pack, he pulls the foil off the untouched side of the pack. Canadian cigarette packs come with umpteen layers of packaging: Plastic cellophane, cardboard, foil etc. The large packs hold 25 cigs each unevenly divided in to a 'small' side and a 'large' side. Unspoken smokers law says you smoke the small side first. This allows one to hold on to more foil longer, which is the most useful part of the pack. Excellent for leftovers. Compton takes the foil from the large side and flattens it out on the bar.   Next two cigarettes are drawn from the small side and placed next to the foil. He closes the pack and slides it back to Hiro.  As for Hiro, he seems pretty fucking out of it. Mind, one has to be pretty fucking out of it in order to traverse public areas dressed like sailor moon. He smokes his cigarette, and offers no further commentary towards Compton; eyes fixed on the ceiling ward curl of smoke.  Between calloused thumb and forefinger Compton starts to roll the first of the two cigarettes above the foil. Slowly and gently emptying the contents. When he's done with this he starts again with the second cigarette and when finished places the two empty shells carefully aside.  "I need to powder my nose," mumbles Hiro, getting to his feet. He leaves his cigarettes -- and Compton's drink -- and ambles off towards the restroom.  Hana glances over after Hiro, curious to see which bathroom he goes in. "If I were him," she says to herself, "I'd definitely choose women's."  Hiro does, in fact, slip into the women's restroom.  "But that's unfortunate for the girls," Hana adds, turning back to her drink, and the very bad game between drunks nearby.  Compton glances over his shoulder at the mongoloid tranny and then sideways at Hana, "You'd be doing me a favour if you followed him toots. The guy could use some help."  "Yeah, even if I were willing to climb that mountain, I wouldn't do it in a public bathroom." Her accent, once she gets to the r's, is clearly Japanese.  Compton' obviously disapointed tries one more time, "Don't use the bathroom then... The guys got cash... Okay, I got the cash and I'm paying. Just fix him up." Yes, he really did just say that. From the looks of him, his type, this is something he does often. Never the less he nonchalantly goes back to his ministrations on his now disemboweled cigarettes.  Hana stares, but it's probably not the kind of stare Compton might usually get when making this kind of request. Maybe Hana's surprised that he dared, so surprised she's forgotten to be pissed. "Have you got 75,000?" she asks, flatly. Maybe she's not offended.  Compton blinks! Okay, that took him a little off guard, "Jesus honey? You for real?"  Hana’s Desc         The words poised, graceful, and subdued describe the appearance of this young Asian best. Bone-china skin covers a sculpted body, though her svelte frame is more understated than buxom. Slender limbs seem to lack almost as much muscle as fat, while finely detailed features work with the hue of her skin to give her something of the appearance of a Childrens Day doll. However, whereas a doll is painted to give the impression of life, this girl goes without makeup, without colour, and it rather suits her-- the signs of life are within her eyes, rather than the colour of her face. Thus, while the sculpture of her cheekbones, her chin, and the fine curve of her nose are precise and delicate, most striking are her eyes. A scheme of a pale moon reflected in night-black waters, they are a liquid and true black. While her expression seems pacific, or at least composed, her eyes alter the effect with a smouldering, dark quality, a quiet, restrained passion that sparks and flares. She smiles but rarely, and it is an odd smile, evocative of an Eastern court, where reserve and discipline dictate the expression of emotion. Her hair is as stark a black as her eyes, and holds to the ethnic paradigm by being exquisitely fine and straight, somewhat past her shoulders. Her hands keep with the theme of the rest of her body. On the left hand, they end in smooth, short nails, while on the right they have been filed to sharp points.           She's wearing a t-shirt, not too lose but not tight. It's white, with a very bishounen looking man swinging a sabre style sword, his hair flying. For those who know either Japanese or the Anime, Vampire Hunter D A pair of loose, dark pants hang low on her hips, the top just covered by the end of her shirt. Upon her head she wears a pair of old English driving goggles, the strap going over her hair as if they were just raised. Over the t-shirt, a long, blackish coat tapers into the waist and thin flares a little at the hips, in a very stylish design. Faux grey fur lines the cuffs and encircles her long white neck, and the coat remains open. Upon her feet she wears some strange black shoes of dull leather. Her hands are in blackish leather gloves.  Carrying: Cricket Phone  "Do I look cheap?" Hana asks, again, as if biting the words in half before they leave her mouth.  You say, “Well, yes.”  It's about then that Hiro seems to materialize from the bathroom, wedging a packet into the side pocket of his jacket. He moves with the careful, exaggerated nongrace of someone who is deeply and properly out of their mind. "Hey, Compy," he mumbles, slumping back onto his still-warm barstool.  "Lemme put it this way honey. Yer not a biker, playing pool or drinking booze in a bar. That means one thing, easy snatch." Compton says this as he turns back to concentrating on his freeform sculpture now that Hiro has returned. He prys the tin open and draws a tiny vial out. The kind perfume samples come in at Sears.  "Is that some weird Canadian culture thing?" Hana asks. "You can't be serious. Empress Keiko over there's wearing a skirt, what kind of invitation is -that-?"  Hiro retrieves his still-smouldering cigarette from the ashtray, hits it, and promptly stubs it out. It only had one drag left in it, anyway. If he's aware of the ongoing conversation, it's only in the most distant way. He gives Compton and Hana the sideways hairy eyeball.  You say, "Hey, my friends kinks ain’t the point. He needs help. All I'm asking you to do is help him."  "Well, I'm not his type. trust me, " Hana says, picking up her glass of orange juice again. "I'll show you.." After taking a drink, she sets her glass down. "Hey, Chingaku, are you up for a challenge?" Hana seems to be addressing Hiro.  Compton takes the vial he's been palming and snaps the head off. Letting the powdery contents settle on the piled tobacco. With practiced care he mixes the substance in to the shredded leaf adfter discarding the container on the floor.  Glassy. Hiro's eyes, that is -- that dull, disconnected sheen. "Pardon me?" he asks, attention gradually tracking to fix on Hana.  "Oh come on," Hana says, turning back to Compton. "I don't think he's even got a mountain to climb."  "Just takes a little encouragement." Compton says over his shoulder, paying more attention to his work on the bar.  Hiro sniffs sharply, scrubbing at his nose with the back of a hand. "Whatever, man," he mumbles, fumbling for a fresh cigarette from his pack. "Hey, uh, why are we in a pool hall?"  Hana must be profoundly bored, or maybe high off the fumes from someone else's drugs, because she rises and walks around Compton's seat. Assuming the glassy eyed mongrel is not quick enough to escape what she does next--    "Ta score." Compton says as he turns back around. Two shortened cigarettes in his hand now with the filters removed. "Here Judy, smoke this."  Hiro isn't even looking at Hana; he's now staring up at the proffered cigarette, and pawing at it in an attempt to secure it for himself. He's not quick on the uptake at the moment.  Compton daftly grins at Hana now, placing the resurrected cigarette on his lips - whatever jag he was on before now lost that he has accomplished his primary goal of birthing a spliff.  Hana's going to have to use a lot of mouthwash after this. She puts her right hand, sharp, evil nails pinning, around Hiro's chubby chin, jerking his face firmly towards herself as she tilts her head, leaning over, and gives Hiro a deep, deep kiss. With tongue.  Hiro paged Hana with 'Uh, Hiro just came back from slamming a couple caps of heroin, and you just startled the shit out of him He's going to be very sick. How do you want to handle this?'."  It's a pretty classic response. Normally this breed of situation only occurs in web comics. Geek dresses in sailor moon drag, ends up in pool hall, and is attacked by a random asian girl after his sidekick makes dispairaging comments. "Mmmphgh," Hiro gurgles. He's obviously not sure if he's being raped or murdered, but he definitely seems to think it's one of the two. "Mmmmphgh!"  Oh. "MMmmmMPHGH!" Oh. Well.  And that -- that's when the stream of greasy vomit erupts from between his lips.  Thank god Hana is fast on her feet. Sensing some sort of...something rising in Hiro, though it's not quite the expected eruption, she sidesteps, and just gets out of the way of that revolting stream. She keeps going, though, just for good measure, uttering a soft but articulate word in Japanese. "Told you I wasn't his type," she says, flatly, to Compton.  Wild-eyed, Hiro manages to stumble while sitting down. This takes a great deal of doing. He retches until all that remains is dry heaves, and manages -- somehow -- to get off the stool and remain on his feet. "Hrrr," he complains, audibly, before stumbling off towards the exit; cigarette still in hand.  Compton is convulsing with kept laughter. His head and ears are turning bright red as tears well up in to his eyes. He still manages to keep the ciggy on his lip and even snake Hiro's lighter form the bar to light it it, "Oh well..." he wheezes, "Was a good try." he manages between chuckles.  Stepping over the steaming pile of Hiro's stomach he collects his coat and the tin and stumbles after Hiro still laughing, "Wait up kid!" he calls as he leaves the place behind.  "If you think that was free, you're mistaken," Hana says, making no move to follow. "But don't worry, i'll collect later."  Hiro stumbles out into the street, leaving staring bikers in his wake.  Roll credits.

      Waterfront - York and Queens Quay(#1114RJ)       Here is the most famous area on the waterfront, the York Quay. You can see the large green and gray building known as Queen's Quay Terminal. Small unique shops and restaurants fill the Queen's Quay Terminal building, providing a nice, if somewhat expensive place to enjoy the waterfront. There are many other smaller office buildings and shops locate at this intersection, all taking advantage of the numerous tourist and city attractions located in the York Quay. Special bus tours begin and end at this location, travelling up and down Queens Quay. To the north lies the city core, CN Tower and Skydome. To the east is the Island Ferry Terminal and the west holds Ontario Place and The Exhibition. Adding to the loveliness of the area are the freshly cleaned sidewalks, newly repaved roads and the sweet greenery in their holders lining the sidewalks.  Contents: Ian Obvious exits: Old Bank Building    York Quay    West    East      The snow falls heavily, and cars stay off the streets. The blanket of white and the swirling flurries keep most folk safely indoors. In the haze of flakes that is the lighted area of a streetlamp however, stands a solitary figure. Black full length coat drawn up with a large hood, gradually succumbing to the ice and snow and transmogrifying into snowmanform. Smoke whips about amidst the white, as the last of a cigarette is spat out from the shadows of the man's headcovering.   Ian emerges from the Eclipse Corp building, his polished shoes trudging through the freezing slush outside. Turning to check the door, he rattles the handle before glancing over his shoulder. Noticing the solitary figure highlighted by the lamp, he looks to either side. Perking a brow, the streets seem vacant other than the two, the weather and hour forcing most in. Slipping his hands in his pockets, he crosses the street to approach the stranger. "Good evening. Awfully cold out here, you need anything?" he inquires politely as he causally closes the distance.   The man turns sharply, as if only imagining a voice formed from the tide and whipping wind. The motion allows a vague notion of his features. Lines of the tattoos stark against the pale skin. A wry smile, "Indubidably. There are many things I need. That however, is not the issue." A pause, the white holes where his eyes should be staring vacant, giving up nothing to the moment. "What is it that you need?"            From broad shoulders to sturdy legs, Ian's powerful physique is obvious. Standing just below six feet, his bulky frame is composed entirely of thick, sinewy muscle. Despite his size, Ian doesn't exhibit the clumsiness most associate with larger individuals. Yet, his callused hands, coupled with a healthy tan and weathered cheeks, speak of a rigorous existence. Dark hair, kept short in a contemporary style, frames his rough features. A square chin completes the outline, lending his face a certain authority. Thin lips, usually drawn in a neutral line, rest below a slightly bent nose. Impassive, gray eyes complete his stoic image.           Clad in an urban-contemporary ensemble, Ian is wearing a black suit over a French blue dress shirt and dark tie. The black, all-wool suit features a four-button, non-vented jacket and double-pleated pant. Beneath his black jacket, the finely woven cotton fabric of his blue shirt provides a pleasing contrast, making the suit look slightly less formal. His silk tie, featuring an alternating pattern of navy blue, silver, and black, is tacked in place with a bone tiepin shaped into a small rapier. His wrists are likewise adorned with bone cuff links featuring a Celtic raven pattern. A pair of black leather, cap-toe shoes complete his cosmopolitan look.           His languid movements and impassive countenance create a suggestion of indifferent. Even his powerful frame is made less imposing by a relaxed stature. Despite his apparent blase, Ian's eyes manage to appear alert and attentive, though his gaze causally drifts about.    Halting a few feet away, Ian steps into the thick snow concealing the sidewalk. Tilting his head curiously, he adds with a smirk, "A warm meal and some dry shoes, but I'll settle for information." Glancing back at the building, he inquires, "Firstly, why in the Hell are you standing out here, in this frigid weather? Of course, it is a public sidewalk, in all, but I'm just curious." His posture remains non-threatening as he chats in a conversational tone.  Those eyes stare out blankly, given the redness around them from the cold and the sheen of sleet that clings to his face, they could in fact be cataracts for all anyone knows. Unsettling how he appears to be looking at you, but could not be at all. "Waiting." says the man, quietly enough for the word to be almost lost in the shriek of the wind. Said wind pushes in the side of his hood, smacking the wet fabric against his cheek. This only causes his smile to widen. "You're missing something."   Ian squints against the bitting wind, his short hair waving against the gust. Noticing the ice that clings to the man, he remarks in a dry tone, "It looks like you've been waiting for a while." Raising his voice against the howl, he stands firm as he air whips his jacket about, kicking up sheets of snow and ice. "I'm always missing something, sir. Do you know of anything in particular?" his tone is firm, the extra volume required to convey his message in the weather.   While terrifyingly cold, and shivering slightly the man seems mentally sharp. Wired. The smile fades, an overly blank look replacing it as he stares in your direction. The hood rustles, snow falling off it as he shakes his head somberly. Ice cracks as the man unplants his frozen shoes from the ground and begins to turn away.  "You are not ready. Time will come." and he turns away, tromping off into the snow.    Ian remains motionless as the man brushes by. Blinking at the cryptic missive, he turns to regard the strange man as he trudges against the snow. Glancing back to the ground, he regards the ice imprints on the ground with a dubious look.  The imprints of work duty soles slowly become obscured by the falling snow as the man tromps on with slow and deliberate steps. Not another word or backwards glance, as he slowly dissapears into the whirling haze.

      Downtown - Spadina and Wellesley W(#269RJ)       The student ghetto dominates this entire area of town. Dilapidated condos and apartment complexes stretch up into the sky. Laundry can be seen hanging off balconies; the paint jobs here are faded and stained with acid rain marks, and the buildings themselves look as if they were built in the 70's. Scattered small commercial shops provide for the residents of this area, who are mainly students attending University of Toronto to the south. A steady stream of student traffic marches by here at all times. In the mornings and afternoons they head out to attend classes, while in the evenings they go out to hit the bars and enjoy the Toronto night life.  l wig  A ten foot wrought iron gate, with ornamental spikes formed on the tip of each pole. It is part of a fence line that surrounds the entire Firehouse Complex, keeping the world out with its stoic gaze.       The outer courtyard of this once noble building, is covered completely with cracked and worn pavement. It surrounds the entire building, which is then surrounded by the imposing ten-foot high wrought iron fence. Each pole is tipped with a fire-hardened spike that gleams gently in the halogen lights that shine brightly from the corners of the flat roof. The building itself was built in the late eighteen hundreds, and if you look closely the cornerstone has a bronze plaque reading eighteen ninety-two that is covered with dirt and forgotten grime. A squat two-story building, built of stone and mortar it has stood at this corner over a hundred years but has not withstood the ravages of time. Much of the once grandiose facade has begun to fall away, revealing in many places the actual stonework that supports the weight of the building. A huge rolling garage door, probably newer then the structure itself since its made of interlocking pieces of iron sits centered into the front wall, with a small human sized door built into it so it need not be opened and closed every time someone wants in or out. There are a series of windows around the building, two on each side on the second floor, while the first floor has one on each side excepting the front in which the large garage door is situated. All of the windows are dark, revealing not an ounce of light from within, possibly dark curtains, or maybe just painted black to keep unwelcome eyes out. Also they are all covered with thick security bars, screwed into the stones with heavy but well rusted bolts. Overall the building gives most viewers a sense of sadness and lost, for what was once a symbol of hope and protection, is now crumbling like so many other grand landmarks.  This Building is a Nightzone   James steps through the Wrought Iron Gate and out into the street. James has arrived.  A bum stands outside one of the student buildings, holding a battered coffee mug shaking it and shivering from the cold in a grungy poncho and toque.  James comes out of the Wrought Iron Gate. It slides closed behind him. He looks around, smiling to himself as he spots Compton. Checking his pockets he begins moving towards the older man.  The drifters bloodshot eyes wake up a little as he spots a perspective mark heading  his way, "S-spare c-c-change m-mister?" the big guy stammers. He twitches oddly, his eye lazy and wandering. Perhaps signs of Parkinson’s?  l James         A young gentleman who appears to be in his mid twenties. He stands a few inches over five feet tall. His long, straight silky hair is a blond so pale as to be almost white. It falls to the middle of his back, and is tied up with a dark green ribbon. His long narrow face and hands, denote a fine bone structure, although his nose is a little on the small side. By far and away his most striking feature is his vibrant emerald green eyes.         He wears a loose fitting green t-shirt, and a relatively new pair of stonewashed levi's. On his feet are a pair of well worn blue Nike's, and from time to time you can catch a glimpse of his socks, which are a dark green. On his right hand ring finger is a silver ring, engraved in a celtic knot pattern, and around his neck is a braided silver chain that disappears in to the collar of his shirt.  James grins at Compton, pulling his hand out of a pocket. Dropping about two dollars wotrth of loose change in to the cup. He speaks up after loosing the change, 'Ofcourse I've got spare change. How's tricks?"  The townie looks perplexed, "Y-you kn-kn-know me mister?" and glances in the cup and gives a half smile. The other side of his mouth seems to be numb, slack.  James nods, "We've met a couple of times before. You probably don't remember me. It's been over a month since the last time I believe.". He looks Compton over, "You probably aught to get something warm to drink. And I've got places to go. Take care of yourself." Woth that he looks around to see if he can spot a Taxi.  "W-wh-what's yer name b-buddy?" the old hobo stutters.  James replie, "James Anderson.", just before hailing a taxi.  Compton half grins again, waving a mitten’d hand in the air at Mr. Andersen as he leaves, "T-thanks..."  James replies, "Any time.", then steps in to the cab that has pulled up, closing the door behind him. James has left.  Compton straightens himself out, and quits with the fake twitching. A wicked grin creeps up his face and he dumps the change from the mug in to a Zip Lock he’s pulled from his pants, “Gotcha motherfucker.” He says savagely to no one, well, maybe the derelict passed out in the stairwell behind him. He now pulls off the poncho and toque, depositing these on top of the sleeping bum with his tin cup, and recollecting his parka and bundling back up. “Thanks bud.” he says to the wastrel before moving on.  ~FIN~

      **Stupid little scene. But Hana has been causing shit and I wanted to cover the bases ICly. The sad part is that this scene had to happen because of her OOC mouth. Anyhoo, it’s over shortly.**  Downtown - Parliament and Front E The downtown core can be seen in the horizon to the west. Here lie many of Toronto's old and abandoned warehouses. Fences set ten feet high with barbed wires interlacing the top portion guards this area closely. Despite the look of these dilapidated warehouses, this is a popular filming area for major motion pictures. The abandoned warehouses make a perfect location for many scenarios used in action movies and TV shows. Overhead, to the west lies the Gardiner Expressway where it joins with the major north-south highway, the Don Valley Parkway. To the west is the St. Lawrence Market and Union Station, while to the south is the docks to Lake Ontario.  This building is a moderate sized light industrial shop. The walls of this two-story building are well-made with cinder blocks and steel beams. There are no windows on the ground level, but a ring of soaped windows circle the building on the second level.  The building sits on an asphalt lot and is surrounded by a tall chainlink fence. Light poles on two, opposite, corners of the lot keep the area illuminated when it is dark outside.  You paged Alex with 'No doubt from your discussions with Hana, you are aware of someone matching Compton's description loitering outside your establishment from the electronic recordings. Well, he's back. Waving his arms over his head, obviously trying to get the camera's attention this time.'.  Compton knocks on the door marked .  Alex comes out of the light industrial shop by way of the service door. Alex has arrived.  Compton stands outside the fence in his heavy parka. The hood up against the gusting snow. Despite this the guys shivers, his lips blue. What kind of fool does this on an afternoon like this?  The service door to the shop opens and out step Alex. He crosses the lot surrounding the shop, stopping at the fence. "Need something,"he asks raising an eyebrow. Two other figures are standing in the open service door watching.  Compton nods shivering , "N-need to ex-explain... Little girl, yesterday." Compton says incoherently. Judging by the rose on his cheeks and the blearyness of his eyes, this outing is being fueled by some strong liquor. "I-I had the wrong place, h-honest. Lil slut tr-trying to ex-extort me."  "Wrong place?..."Alex queries with a single nod, accepting what Compton says but maybe not actually believing it just yet,"So,... which place /were/ you looking for?..."  Drawing a large hand from the parka's pocket he points westwards, "Over t-ther by tha u-university." he shivers throught the words. "G-got directions wrong." Compton continues to explain, obviously relived that you at least understand him.  Compton unzips his parka a little and draws a 26'r from inside and takes a belt of the brown fluid before continuing. The liquor seeming to warm him a little, he points at several other building in the area, "I check all of those actually. Was just dumb luck I ran in to that whore here. I wouldn't even had known who or what was here if she hadn't tried to threaten me with... well, you guys." He really seems to be talking from the heart. Why else would someone walk out here in a bizzard and try to convince a stranger, tha there was nothing wrong, when nothing was wrong to begin with.  "Really?..."Alex says not really seeming to pay much attention to which direction Compton points in, though that is so hard to tell with those shades. He starts to turn to head back inside but then stops,"Oh... I understand that Hana has expressed interest in your group?..." he asks tilting his head slightly.  "Hana?" Compton asks. "That's the hookers name is it? Well, I guess so. Hana seems to think I owe her money. She's fucked up." and tucks the bottle back inside his coat and zips back up. "Sorry for any misunderstanding, man." he adds in a neighborly fashion. It doesn't come off very well, and he looks uncomfortable doing it, like he's not used to 'patching things up' as it were.  The quarter finally drops in to the slot, and Compton blinks, saying the words over again to himself, "Wait, what kind of interest?"  "Yeah. Hana,"Alex says with a single nod,"The young lady that was looking to talk to your friend Dr. Adler."  Compton nods, squinting as a particularly hard gale of wind blows snow in to his face, "Alright. Thanks."  Alex turns and head across the lot and back into the shop, through the service door. Alex opens the heavy steel service door and step into the light industrial shop.

      Derelict Home - Main Room   The inside of this empty home is still relatively intact compared to large patches of missing paint and exposed concrete of the exterior. It’s the interior of a two story, unfurnished house, in fair condition. A modestly composed structure, there's a kitchen, a den, two bathrooms, and two bedrooms upstairs. The small imperfections are covered with fresh paint, the smell still strong in the air. Apparently just waiting for new occupants. Hard wood floors and an off white do this residence nicely. Though judging by the outside, this house might've been waiting for a long time. There's no lights, though it's not hard to spot the lack of furniture. It's lone piece, a mattress perhaps left by squatters in the living room.  Compton stomps in from the cold, holding a six pack of Coors up in the air as offering to the A/V gods that are currently scrutinizing him. "Come bearing gifts." he grumbles to the darkness.   It's an intercom voice. You know from previous visits that the whole house is wired, all patched into the underground sanctum. "Tits. 'S open..."  Nearby, a male voice shouts, "As in, come on down..."  Compton nods and grins up at the corner where assumes that there is a camera and goes on his way, leaving wet foot prints behind.  You go down the stairs. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Compton has left. Derelict House - Kitchen   Beneath two stories, lies a basement with all the common amenities. However, it's been converted into a semi living space.   In one corner, a boiler and heater stand, though only function down here. The fuse box is also configured to power the subterranean portion of this structure. A washer drier are next, and a small makeshift sink. All four walls have been padded with heavy insulating material and wires run down from key holes in the ceiling. A few bundles are strapped together, feeding into a video network system. Four screens sit at a small square table, flashing camera feeds from strategic points outside and inside the house above. A reclining chair, made of brown leather, encircled with ashes and empty beer bottles on the hard cement floor. A TV sits atop another broken TV, its wires arranged to split off the block's main cable system.    To the far wall, a long table has been set up, stacked with a variety of chemical compounds and mixing material. Everything from begin base liquids, to corrosive acids stored in chem-hazard tanks. A myriad mix of beakers, vials, and test-tubes line the shelves above. Gloves, goggles, tongs, all things a junior mad scientist would need to conquer the world. Some larger steel drums of chemicals are stored under the table, and some electronic chem-analysis equipment blinks an occasional red flash.   And finally, set along the length of the large basement, seems to be a make-shift firing range. Shell casings litter the floor at one end, opposite from a large reinforced steel door dimpled with a thousand bullet dents. The remains of a tattered paper target hang on the door. Over it, a picture of Ronald McDonald.   Contents: Chase  Compton enters. Wearing his old parka still, but gone is that lame Santa's cap. In it's place is a wide cut on his forehead and he moves stiffly like his back is bothering him. He doesn't look happy - well, not that he ever did but something seems to be bothering him above and beyond the surface crustiness he usually projects. "Thanks." he says simply.  Chase, Chase and more Chase. "Oi." In unison everyone. There's one in the leather chair watching Bewitched on the tube. And two at the lab table with protective eye wear working in tandem with soldering irons. The two at the table wear lab coat, and despite chiming in with the greetings, their work ethic is diligent. Some sort of electronic device seems to be the object of their attention, fashioned into a collar of sorts.   Lazy Chase is the one who continues speaking though. "Sup neegro?" Joint burning nearby.  Compton gawks. No really, his mouth fucking drops to the floor and his beady eyes bug out of their sockets. So, he tries what anyone would do and grinds his free hand in to his eyes trying to clear them of the multiple vision he's suddenly experience.  That fails.  But Compton is a part of the College with talking monkeys and whatnot. He quickly just accepts this amount of weirdness as okay, but shoots it a dirty look as if saying, 'Okay. I'll accept this. For now. Just don't push it.' and gingerly steps through, pulling Coors cans from the plastic rings, depositing them by the Chase's on his way through until he gets to Lazy Chase and hands over the last one.   "I, er... Sorry. Shoulda brought more." he dead pans.  "Oh! Silver Fuckin Bullet." Lazy Chase lurches from his slumped position to accept the offering. "Fuckin' A man. Gracias." The others smile, but continue working. Registering the slight shock to Comps, an affirmation. "Don' worry, I guzzle 'n they get twisted."   At that, one of the working Chases shows the room his middle finger, before connecting some wires to an injection system.  "Where the hell you keep findin' Coors up here, cabrone? Can't get this shite anywhere, really. All the liquor stores 'r full up with micro-brews 'n whatnot..."  Compton says in a matter of fact kinda way, "Ya know - that hand thing the College kids do? Well, everytime they do that shit ya gotta hand over a smoke. I don't smoke see? And at $9 a pack they can get stuffed if they think I'm buying the good stuff. I know some Wahoo's who smuggle stuff across the lake, like cheap ass cigarettes. They bring beer too. Yankie beer. No one else I know likes it though - so it ain't no big thing."  *SNAP* There goes the first foamy beer. Hola Hiro, you salty dog. Here's the situation. (Parents are gone on a three week vacation)   There's the chair. In the chair is one Chase, wearing a 7-11 shirt and opening a Coors from the heard that Comps just brought in. At the lab table, there are in fact, two more Chases. They seem to be working on some electronic device without pause.   Lazy Chase, the one in the chair watching Tabitha Stevens in Bewitched, is smiling a kid's grin to Comps. Tickled as fuck to have some Coors up in his shit. "Nice." he says between gulps. "Like my coyotes. But different product."  Compton shuffles his feet a little looking down, suddenly becoming more uncomfortable, "I can get you as much as ya like, but I... Um..." okay, now he just looks like an idiot. Breaking ice like this obviously is pain for the big guy. "I gotta ask you a fave." he says bluntly.  "Anyone who brings me Coors, gots one coming." Healthy swig. "'S on yer mind, cabrone?" Lazy Chase leans forwards a bit for the answer.  Compton idly touches the gash on his head and stalks away agitated, before turning back a few more steps. He sighs, and dumps his parka on top of a crate. "Okay. Is like this see?" he starts all high strung, "Ya hangout with this street kids, tough kids like Penny, right? And they kinda look up to ya..." ya okay, in Comptons mind anyways "And ya feel pretty tough yerself. Being able to blow shit up by tweaking the formulae of the machine and shit."  "But then some shit happens, and ya find yerself on yer ass in the street ready to load your drawers and there's nothing you can do about it until Penny shows up to save yer ass, again." he looks down at his beer gut ashamed. What a fucking pathetic sight. Someone shoot him already.  Perhaps lacking the sympathy gene, Chase doesn't get it yet. But he's just downing beer watching Comp's monologue instead of Bewitched. One of the worker bees behind the lazy one, prompts for more info.   "Whatcha talkin' 'bout?"  Compton sucks it up, that big fucking baby, "Got my ass kicked by at 16 yr old slant hooker." Yup. That's gotta sting anyones ego. "I want ya to train me." There, he said it finally.  "Can't go to one of the kids." Compton syas, "It'd destroy my image." Uh huh. There it is again, but whatever. We're all delusional in our own ways.  "Oh." Lazy Chase sets the beer down and takes one final drag of his dwindling joint. "Ok." See? That wasn't overly hard. "Ummmm, lemme see whatcha got first, eh?" At that, the thick man stands. One of the worker bees grabs something from the shelf and hands it to lazy. A pill of course, and they work together with one mind judging by the precision of movements. "Wanna kick my ass? Make ya feel better, mebbe. Good way ta judge yer skills to."  Chase pops the pill, and feels no pain.  Compton arches a brow at this one, and visibly swallows (GULP), "Well, okay..." he says with no assurance, and starts to unbutton his freaky shirt and strips down to a wife beater. The slabs of fleshy meat on his arms and chest fully exposed there. He's got the mass, just no tone. He balls up his fist and puts his guard up, spreading his feet, classic boxers pose. "You ready?" he asks with a little more conviction.  Steps into the dungeon proper, Chase makes sure he's not near anything dangerous for this. No stance, no hint of readiness. Just some beer wiped from his lips and a sniffle.   "Ya, ok. Let's have it then..." He doesn't have the posture of someone who's about to dodge a punch or get hit squarely.  Compton shuffles forward and throws a right aiming to beak Chase on the nose. Pretty good form.  Robotically, Chase head snaps back with the right cross. No blood. No flinching. No hint of discomfort. But a sniffle. He takes a step to his left, nose twitching. "Eh, ya the form's alright. Let's have another." Slack fucker.  Compton grins, loosening up. He shuffles his feet again, flinches to one side (okay, now he's getting silly) and throws another right at Chases midriff.  Fist meets flesh, Comps can feel a wall up muscle under the punk's shirt. This time Chase doesn't react as much, as the force is absorbed in his mass. "More." He's not even moving. 'S like a human punching bag with an out-dated haircut.  Compton is breathing a little heavier now, a light sheen of sweat showing up on his bald head, he nods simply and let’s fly with a left right combo.  "Ow! Fuck!" Compton hops back shaking and nursing his left wrist.  Well the first strike was completely off. Despite landing, it just glances off the side of Chase's face. Chalk it up to the sweat. The second at least, manages to draw a few drops of blood from his nose. The punk's head is thrown this way, then that way, in the succession of blows. A sniffle, no pain.   "You alright there?" Concern for Comp's wrist.  The slight cut Comps opened up on the bridge of Chase's nose, closes like a fleshy ziplock bag about a few seconds after impact. It leave the faintest of lines, though a few drops of blood still splatter his cheek and upper lip.  Compton grumbles, working the pain out of his hand, "Yeah... bad wrist. You alright?"  A shrug. No gash. No pain. "'Course." Chase says, as if that's a commonly known fact. "I'm uh... I got somethin' in me." Is all the explanation he offers for the self sealing skin he wears.   "Solid blows. Gotta work on yer conditioning 'n mebbe aim. But the form's there."  Compton nods, still huffing a little, he shambles over to a nearby Coors can and helps himself. Good for what ails ya. "Thanks." he says with some surprise, " Lil cunt was fast though. I never even got a chance to do anything."  "Yeah well, slants usually are. We'll get into some proper sparring next time if ya want." Lazy Chase walks over to reclaim his thrown of slack.  "That'd be cool." The old guy says, turning and retriving his shirt he starts to redress himself. "I'll give ya call."  ~FIN~

      [Ed note: Painful scene. May want to skip it, or delete it outright... Oh, Compton gets attacked again.]  Announcement: Silvius shouts, The peace of the afternoon is shattered suddenly as an explosion rips through the downtown area. The source of the explosion seems to be in the area of Parliament and College E. The blast can be felt for blocks in each direction, and heard for miles. Power flickers and goes out in the neighboring buildings, and car alarms ring through the afternoon air.  Downtown  Parliament and College E  You find yourself in the heart of Cabbagetown. This is one of the oldest remaining residential areas of Toronto. It has been virtually untouched by time. Buildings, their architecture dating them back to the turn of the century, rise all along the narrow one-way streets which criss-cross through this area. However, a new surge of 'yuppies' moving into the area has brought forth a flow of change to the old homes. Entire homes are renovated to a more, modern decor. The streets are now being filled with parked BMWs and Mercedes. Upscale boutiques and cafes are springing up on every corner. The more traditional residents have started to complain, creating a storm of controversy over the historic nature of Cabbagetown. In this case, however, tradition seems to be taking a back seat to wealth and power. Indeed it has, from the sight of the newly cleaned sidewalks and the freshly paved roads as well as the beautiful colouring of the fresh flowers and newly added trees.  Contents: Silvius  Compton shambles up the street, bundeled in his heavy parka and winter boots. He looks spooked, beady eyes flashing about.  Erick arrives from the north. Erick has arrived. Isobel arrives from the south. Isobel has arrived.  Isobel steps from a taxi and begins to run down the street, not an easy thing in heels.... her eyes wide with concern as she sees the damage....  A jittery looking Compton is skirting around what parked cars there are along the street, and peering over top of his erstwhile cover.  Isaac arrives from the south. Isaac has arrived.  Isaac runs up shortly after Isobel as he gets lost in the city easily. He clamors to a stop and a huff as he sees Isobel.  Isobel hurries to take a look around and then moves towards the crowd that has gathered  Erick moves down the street, not running, not panicked. Like a king he seems to move, but then here he pretty much is. However anger is on his face as he surveys the area and prepares for the fall out. Car alarms and shocked screams and yells fill the air, but overshadowing all this commotion is the roar of flames, green flames actually, which currently completely engulf the old McDulan family grocery. The glass of nearby buildings and car windows litter the streets.  Silvius slips into his Robes of Office and into Judge Mode!  Isobel looks over as she spots Isaac and just nods. calling to him "I caught a cab" then she begins to move through the crowd.. wanting to hear what the coppers had to say  Compton stands across the street. His face flush with excitement. Doing a fine job representing the do-nothing-voyeur-public in times of crisis.  Erick moves down the street, scanning for only a moment. He taps a few people as he moves by them, the most Irish from the look of it. Directing people to take the wounded to the other side of the street. That thin line of anger still there. The cops are going to show up for this one. He knows it and it pleases him not at all. A few others directed to find the owners of those cars and get the alarms shut off before he moves to where he directed the injured to be taken, god knows when the paramedics will arrive and he is assuming people need help now.  Isaac scans around and makes his way over to Isobel and asks, "All right, since you got here before me, what do you think happened?"  Isobel shakes her head and points towards the back of one of the estates where her little apartment is... "my god I was there only 30 minuets ago... " she shivers and then adds quickly "I need to help.. " with that she goes over to one of the ladies and helps her up from the ground, the poor dear is pretty banged up but she can walk.. carefully she leads the lady to a safe looking stoop, assuring her she needs to have some one look at those cuts...  The interesting thing is, no cops or firemen seem to be anywhere around here. But what's more is the strange green color that seems to permeate the flames. As erick directs the irish folk, they nod, some growing calmer as the seems to recognize the man a bit. They move off to help those they can.  Compton fishes one of those cheap disposeable cameras form his parka's pocket along with a small flask. FIrst he takes a belt of the hooch, to keep the home fires burning and then starts taking random snap shots of the chaos and carnage around him. zzip *CLICK* zzzip *CLICK*  Spotting Isobel Erick moves to the lady she has helped. "Take her two doors up lass. We need all of them together. See if ya can find anyone else with first aid trainin as well." He then moves back there.  Admiistering the little first aid he can. Actually tossing one man the keys to his house and telling him where the first aid kit is. He finally seems to notice the green flame and mutters something about old copper wiring.  Isobel nods her head and hurries to obey. guiding the lady to a safe place and shouting in relief as she spots one of the locals who works at the hospitial, he is hurrying towards Erick  Isaac shoves through the crowd himself and looks upon the scene. Since there are no police around, he takes a quick scan for damages... and then begins talking to people that seem to have had property damaged, especially cars....  Jim arrives from the south. Jim has arrived.  Jim walks through the intersection of Parliament and College, to see several people he recognizes. He tosses a raised eyebrow to Isobel as he passes.  Isobel works to get small children reunited with their parents. She is moving through out the milling mass, her heels a real pain in the butt  Jim walks north along Parliament to Wellesley. Jim has left.  Everyone on the streets has relatively minor injuries, glass, cuts, that sort of thing. the blast seems to have been engineered to engulf the building with little collateral damage.  Erick does not even look at the man. The first aid kit is his major concern. He probably knows him from years ago when his sister ran the place, if he's that old. He works on the wounds until the kit arrives and he can do it properly. One of the men leading people over is directed. "Go ta tha pub and get Seamus to get a cop here. An Irish one if possible, if there are still any onna force. But this shite we canna handle on our own. Not until later." The look in his face says someone is going to bleed for this, but that is later, this is now.  Jim arrives from the north. Jim has arrived.  Isaac looks at Erick as he is done making his rounds. "What the hell are you talking about? You're making this sound like terrorist attack."  Isobel looks up and actually spots Jim, she waves to him "Jim Jim! Help me please, I can na find this little ones Mother.." she winces as she holds the crying child.. trying to keep up with the dirty faced red haired tyke.....  Jim yells articulately. "WHAT THE FUCK!?"  Swan arrives from the west. Swan has arrived.  Jim goes about trying to pull the worst injured out of the rubble.  Erick looks up at the disheveled man who adresses him and just smiles grimly. "You a reporter or a cop lad? If ya are piss off I got me hands full here if ya didna notice. If ya aren't then it ain't terorists I'm worried aboot." He ducks at the second explosion, almost seeming to before it happens. "God damn it!" That dark look again on his face.  Isaac notes the pre-emptive reaction and says, "You know something about this, tell me what the hell is going on now, or I'll just have the cops take you in for questioning also."  Isobel is trying to help up one of the older men who usually sits outside and plays checkers.. she still has the crying dirty faced child on her hip,.. bouncing him gently as she steadies Old Mat... "its ok darln' we will find your mudder not to fret.... " as she speaks Old Mat looks up and blinks "why lass my mudder has been dead these last 22 years ... you sure you are not the one who took a brick to the head  Siomen arrives from the west. Siomen has arrived.  The building explodes again, seems possibly a gas main or the like finally gave to the intense heat. sirens are heard in the distance, growing closer as the entire neighborhood, the irish portion at least, seems to come to life to help. Neighbors futilely attempt to cool the fire with garden hoses and fire extinguishers, others form a bucket brigade. Yet more seem to come from the clinic, taking in the wounded there.  Isobel blinks in confussion and then has to laugh, but it is short lived as the second explossion hits... "i.. I was talking to the child Mat..." she sighs and then shakes her head. "nar mind.. is going to be ok. come on hurry .. hurry we do nah need to take more damamge  Compton keeps working his tourist trinket camera, snapping shots of the human conflict that is unravelling itself out on the street. He stands safely behind the scene next to some battered parked cars.  Swan moves to the periphery of the gathered group, speaking into a cellphone, as he scans the area for imminent signs of danger.  Jim grabs what people he can, and begins to pull them towards the clinic, he hollers at the top of his lungs. "Is there a fuckin' doctor out here? Come on you fuckers!" He glances over to Compton and yells at the man. "You! Yeah you, motherfucker! Drop the goddamn camera and give these people a hand you sadistic fuck!"  Hept-Seshet arrives from the west. Hept-Seshet has arrived.  Erick stands as the people atre taken to the clinic. They're better off there. He looks at Isaac. What I know is that two explosions just hit me fuckin' neighborhood and you're gettin in me face. Now get the hell outta me face, and if'n yer smart out of me neighborhood before I stick something hard and big and possibly flamable up yer arse. This is not the time to be accusin me of shite.  Siomen wanders down the street, drawn by the sirens and explosions, just another gawking fool Swan finishes his conversation and pockets his phone.  Escalus has arrived.  Isaac looks at the truck pulling up and waves the person emerging over to him. He then turns back to erick and says, "Are you threatening me now? So now they have to question you /and/ hold you on account of verbal assualt?"  Isobel blinks as she hears Erick being yelled at by Isaac but she does not interfere, instead she sets the small child down and begins to move her way back towards the cars where the man with the camera is snapping away like some voyeur tourist...  Swan walks west along College to Jarvis. Swan has left.  Erick smiles at the man. "I ain't threatenin ya welp. I'm givin ya friendly advice. Ya ain't a cop or ya'd be helpin out. Yer steppin on toes here, so either get ta helpin, or get tha fook out. Ain't noone here want ta deal with yer attitude, you're causin people ta suffer. An before ya threaten me ya might want ta keep in mind that ya accused me of some pretty nasty shit happenin ta a business I have interest in." He's losing his temper and his patience. But the man in front of him doesn't hold it for long, his head swivels and he begins to move in the same direction as Isobel, growling under his breath about vultures as the rude man is forgotten in favor of a much more satisfying target.  Giving the hecklers no mind, Compton continues to document the crisis. Sure it's thankless work. Nobody cares for the paparazzi during the mess, but afterwards when Mom's read the Time magazine in line at the supermarket, and comment how tragic the images are or when the CEO's on the shitter reading that months National Geographic he realizes how brave his country men are to have done what they did in times of need, all because of the pictures. North America the contradiction. No one wants to love the ones who get the picture, they just want to see the images. The photographer and the photograph have become alienated from each other. The images must be pure. They must come from no where in to the media. Compton is just one of the thankless scum who feed Canada its hypocritical sense of moralness.   Jim drags those he can out of the rubble, and begins administering what rudimentary first aid he can amidst the chaos. He tears up clothing to make tourniquets, elevates injured limbs, and talks softly to those on the brink. On occasion he pulls a silver flask from his jacket, and allows an injured soul a slug from its contents. All the while, he is alternately screaming at others to help out, get supplies, and occasionally, to 'fuck right off'. His presence is not one of leadership, but some stunned bystanders seem to acknowledge his cries, and join him in aiding the injured.  Hept-Seshet looks around and she grabs a few people and she points them at some people, "You, put pressure on that wound like this." and she shows the person how and then she points the other person at another wounded person, "You, hold pressure on her headwound." she then stalks over to Erick, her little form likely like a puff of edierfdown but the fury in her golden eyes packs a whallop, "Ypou don't worry about the stupid scut snapping pictures! Help with the wounded, let him be a jackass, the hurt people need help more!" she souts before turning to help more, organizng more bystanders. Isobel has partially disconnected.  Ryan arrives in a blue-green chevy, pulling as close as he can to the scene without interfering with police or individuals trying to get out of the area. When he gets as close as he can with his car, Ryan then parks and gets out to wander into the area on foot. He retrieves a small disposable camera from the vehicle before making his way in Isaac's direction. "Tragedy makes everyone edgy," Ryan says as if to catch Isaac's attention, "Best to leave him be. As Ted's elsewhere, it'd be helpful if you got a few pictures as we do what we can to help." Ryan then offers Isaac the camera before gazing about the scene to decide how best help can be given.  Siomen stands and watches, he shifts his backpack slightly and blinks at the scene, he seems rather quiet and just takes it all in. He doesn't seem to recognize anyone, nor want to be bothered by anyone either.  Isaac grunts and takes the camera. "Your the damn reporter, you should be doing this." Still, he makes sure to get a snapshots of the strange flames coming from the store, the helpers, and any apparent damage caused while standing back.  The sirens finally arrive, not too bad of a response time. Though judging from the fierce flames,the damage is done, the fire fighters will have a time of containing the blaze, let alone saving any of the building. And if anyone was inside... it'd be a good bet they aren't alive any longer. But none the less, the fire trucks pull through the crowd and Toronto's Bravest scatter to their work. 3 ambulances pull into the scene as well, and the paramedics start to take over the first aid.  Skip arrives from the north. Skip has arrived.  John arrives from the west. John has arrived.  Silvius pages: okay, Isobel is kicking at you and making a grab for the camera, do me a favor and roll me a   Compton rolls dexterity+dodge privately to Silvius at diff 6. For a total of 2 success(es).  Silvius pages Compton and Isobel: Okay, Isobel's action was successful, so if is could pose it, and Compton, when your pose comes up, pose your reaction, yet failure to resist please ;)  Isobel slips through the cars towards Compton, gritting her teeth as she suddenly goes into action. With a whirl of her feet she suddenly slams Compton with a flying drop kick... the camera sails into the air....... and falls smashing to the ground as she strikes with incredible agility... and jumps back...  Erick blinks as he is dissrespected in hsi neighborhood again. "Lass. If ya interfere with tha professionals doing tha medical work again I will see yer bitch ass taken in fer it. Don'tcha give me another god damn order, and what I said about getting the fook out goes just as well fer you." He looks back at issac, too many people with Cameras. So long as he don't take yer picture doin tha let him keep his guy gettin the pictures is actually helping. Then damn the tux he's moving to the front of one of the bucket brigades, until the hoses can get to work.  the hoses finally get hooked up and the water starts flying. The few fire personnel that are not on hose teams start to usher the civilians back, breaking up the bucket brigades with words of appreciation. Off i the distance more sirens can be heard approaching. The rescue personnel finally get the wounded under control, thanking those who have been helping but asking them to back off and allow them to do their jobs.  Compton, who is just doing his part to record the incredible vitality of the human spirit for prosperity spots the crazy woman heading at him at the last moment. He tries to move out of the way, but being older and heavier doesn't have much of a chance against an unprovoked attack like this. Isoble does her thing. $12.99 camera skitters away, and the big guy stands there just looking mighty insulted. "Crazy cunt." is all Compton deadpans.  Jim stands aside, allowing the crews to do their jobs. He looks around for a place that needs a hand. His jacket, hat and gloves are gone now, given to some more deserving soul. He stands caked in dust and slushy mud, coughing and shivering, his empty flask in hand and a glazed look in his eyes as he surveys the mayhem.  A bloodied and bruised redheaded boy pushes his way past the medics that try to tend to him. he looks beaten, not from the explosion, but more like he had just recently had his ass kicked good. He stumbles over to Erick and slumps against him, whispering to the man.  Hept-Seshet shakes her head a bit as she watches the mess going on and she sighs as she looks around.  Ryan simply nods to Isaac as he says, "Yeah, good afternoon to you as well." As Compton is 'attacked', Ryan frowns and mutters to Isaac, "Uh...keep taking pictures. I'll smooth things over..." He then steps aside to allow any firefighters and paramedics who might have arrived to pass without causing an obstruction. After all, there are plenty of stories of those who meant to help accidently causing more injury through their own incompetence. Instead, Ryan seems to quote as if his words were important, "After all, such photographs hold a great importance. Despite those who see the world through only the glassy world of television or the dry site of paper, there is still a need for them to be involved in such tragedies. How can one mourn the fallen if there is nothing to which their memory is held? How can one truly understand that which the police and firefighters must put up from day to day? How can one truly appreciate the safety which they take for granted? No, continue with your important role and you will be overlooked, but appreciated nonetheless."  Siomen watches in amazement at the scene. all this noise, burning, smoke... and now some fighting. He just shakes his head slightly in wonder.  Nothing helps people feel more calm and secure than to see a lawyer running towards the scene of an accident. Maybe not, but Skip Tanner thinks so. Attracted to the sounds of sirens and such like a deer to headlights, he slows his pace as he nears the scene. "All right, Skip, this is it. Gotta look good here" He takes a moment to check his hair, adjust his suit and make sure that there arent any sweat stains from the run. "Good, looking sharp. Important to look professional." Clearing his throat, he takes on a very serious expression and speaks to an imaginary person to practice his lines, "Im very sorry for your loss, maam and/or sir, but it is important at times like these to protect your interests and the interests of your family. You dont want to miss out on any reparation to damages" As he gets on to the more legal terms, he starts mumbling incoherently as if hes practiced the lines many times before until he finally just nods, "All right, sounds good. Lets get this show on the road." Adjusting his tie, he walks calmly towards the scene. This just might be a great opportunity for a little name and card dropping. Nearing the chaos, his carefully practiced lines start falling apart since Skip has never actually used them in a real life situation. Standing awkwardly in the middle of everything, he just dumbly asks, "Uh.does anybody need a lawyer?"  John blinks at the giant clusterfuck as he approaches down the street. He slips into an alley and moves through it as best he can toward the fire without being seen. The man blinks his eyes and they change colour briefly before taking on their normal blue. They are still somehow... different. He moves toward the crowd now quietly, keeping an eye out for something.  Isaac looks at John as he approaches and waves. He then tosses the camera to Ryan and says, "Right. Here, you sway off the vengeful drunkish soccer watchers while I do something else." He pads over to Skip and points to where the store owner or however looks like they might have been hurt is currently and says, "There you go, a real crisis. There's some people that might need your help."  Erick holds the boy to him, managing to get the blood smeared on his tux, seems to have forgotten he was wearing the damn thing. He picks the lad up, as he does he reaches into his pocket tossing a bill at Compton. "That should pay for camera." then he carries the boy to the nearest paramedic. Speaking to him softly. When he is done he makes sure the boy is in the poper hands and watches him, that look of rage on his face darker now.  Crisis always brings the nut jobs out it seems. Not out of the proverbial woodwork but out of what would normally be sane, moral people. Compton realizes he's been too close too long with such people. People who dream of greatness through out their mundane days, only to have something extreme happen and take licence to act out. He uses a good dose of rationality, zips up his parka, stuffs his hands in to his pockets and turns to go, only breifly pausing to pick up the battered camera.  ~FIN~

      [Ed. note: Penny plays pool. Really well. Impresses locals and makes a new friend.]  Pandora's Box - Pool Hall       The ceiling is set high with churning metal fans. The blades churn a thick haze of smoke from cheap cigars and the pungent aroma of sweat mixed with stale spilt beer. The bar runs the length of the far wall much like a saloon in an old western. A polished brass foot-rail gleams in the fading light of the occasional dropped match and guttering cigarette butt.       Many of the patrons watch each other with looks of a cautious calculation. Not only are those opposite the pool table viewed with suspicion, but also the few one might mistake as a friend. A darkness of nefarious deed reigns within the shadows as the lighting illuminates from the mouth down. It is as though the dark conspires to hide the intent deep within the eyes from the light of revelation. Then again the windows to these souls only come up black.                                   NIGHTZONE                                                            --> Places and view enabled.   Contents: Pool Table Chuck Obvious exits:  Devros moves past the usual drunkards, taking a quick stop by the bar and casting a glance over Chuck. "The usual, Chuckie.." He doesn't bother taking a seat, merely leaning his back against the counter and settling his gaze on the 'crowd', checking for familiar faces.  There's a table toward the back that's been left in mid-play, cues crossed over the felt as clear indicators. One of the two players is off in the corner counting out singles and the other, Penny, is just lighting up returning from a bathroom break. Taking a 'fuck it, I'll stay' approach to the game, she unties the sash of the trench she wears and throws it at high stool where it lands, crumpled.  "Oi," beckoning with two fingers to the shark counting out, she takes a drag and fingers down a stick "s'finish, hey?"  The guy's amused. He thinks she's funny. "Yeah a'right sweetheart, double or nothin'?" It's obvious he's winning. Five stripes, one solid left. And the eitghtball.  Devros soon takes his eyes from the ranting beggar in the corner, his gaze drifting to the pool table, an exciting spot to peep at, as always. The bartender returns a few moments later, handing Dev a bottle of beer. "Thanks. Put that to my tab..", he calls, coming a few steps closer to the table, not making the fact he's overhearing the chat very subtle.  Winning but not confident or comfortable in the least, his bravado lacks sincerity. This guy - let's call him Greg, Greg has a look about him, like he's out of his element. He gives any casual spectator the impression, given the sweat beading on his upper lip and forehead, that he's about to lose a great deal of money.  The chalkboard behind them shows Penny as three up on him.  "C'mon, it's your shot" she leans back to a post, tall enough that the shadows linger from the nose down, her smoke curling ever upwards, the cut of her smile terrible.  You don't really have to be much of a skilled pool player to realize the guy will have a hard time topping his opponent and getting the jackpot. Devros takes another step forward, slipping a gloved hand down the side of his trench and pulling a pack of cigarettes. As if the bar weren't foggy enough. He watches the rest of the game intently, glancing between Greg and Penny.  Making a fist of his left hand, Greg knuckles down to the felt. Somewhere under the din of voices at the bar there's music. His brow wrinkles but it's clear he can't concentrate, not with Penny watching so smug. There she is, breathing easy. Isn't she? He looked away for a second and she vanished but the door to the back hallway's still swinging shut so he picks up and rests heavily on the cue, asiding to someone sympathetic "That's like the hun'eth time she done that, yeah?" "Yeah. Fucken girls man." "Whadaya think's up with that?" "No idea man, don't ask tho' ..chicks hate it when you ask."  It was only five minutes, maybe six that Penny was gone and as she comes back, her hand's smoothing down the right side of her shirt, tugging at it. Picking out a stripe from the left corner pocket, she rolls it back out to the table - some weird house rule, maybe? But it does explain a lot.  Smoked down to the filter already, she goes "So?" laying down a coin on the edge "let's go."  Ready for it, Greg hunkers down to the tableside again, lines up behind the big white ball and scratches.  Devros pulls a cigarette, replacing the pack for his white lighter. His gaze only leaves the table to follow Penny on her way to the bathroom, and then back to Greg. He curls his lips into a thin smile, shaking his head at the poor guy, aware of his defeat. As soon as the girl returns and the game is resumed, Dev moves towards the closest wall, resting his back against it.  Six stripes on the table, one for each pocket. Penny rolls the blue square across her stick, stalking the felt. Elbowing down to the ledge, she calls out every shot and procedes clockwise to make them in quick succession like she'd set it up and arranged it this way. Except for the eightball.  Poor Greg, he never had a chance. "Oh t'hell with it," his hand rolling the eight into the side pocket, standing there slack-jawed, pissed off and much poorer than when he started off the night, the bowl full of coins and bills going toward's Penny's end of the table. She has no hangers-on, no one's asking her to buy the next round - this isn't that kind of place, these aren't that sort of people. As she counts out, the coins go one by one into the pocket of the trench and the bills get folded up into her back pocket.  Hana comes in, smoking. She pauses near the door to finish her cigarette, which she ditches in an abandoned glass on the nearest table. Time to start staking out the place. All the regulars know her by now, sometimes irritation in their eyes, sometimes pleasure, as they glance at her wandering form. She walks through the tables, looking slowly from one to the next.  Catherine opens the door and walks into the pool hall. Catherine has arrived. Aaron opens the door and walks into the pool hall. Aaron has arrived.  Aaron smiles to Catherine and follows her gesture to the pool table, 'Sure...but what will the stakes be?"  Hana decides none of the current games are worth it, and starts for the door again.  Devros casts a glance over Hana as she enters, recognizing her face from a few nights ago. His attention soon returns to the pool game though, being held between a drunken local and Penny. It's another casual night at Pandora. More strangers follow, deserving another glance by the shaven-headed freak. Not much of a surprise there either, since there's always someone new to join the fun.  Catherine blushes and gives Aaron a look. She then heads towards the bar, pointing to something on the menu.  Aaron nods to Hana as he passes and moves to join Caterine, nodding to her as he settles down  Hana opens the door and walks out onto the stoop. Hana has left.  Catherine orders a beer. Chuck grunts towards Catherine, then brings the order she ordered. Chuck sends the Catherine's order sliding to the end of the bar, where is sits an waits for Catherine to pick it up. Aaron takes a seat at the barstools. Aaron orders a Hard Cier. Chuck nods and fixes the order for Aaron.   Aaron says "OK..I give up spelling tonight" Catherine picks up the beers, seeing that Aaron made an order himself. Oh well, she heads towards the table.  Watching Penny's display with the cue, Dev has to face she's actually good. Good enough to beat him, perhaps? As the poor sob wanders out to drink his sorrows, the shaven-head wanders towards Penny. Hands are slipped on each side pocket of his trench, and a weak, somewhat half-assed smile is open. "That was a good game..for a newbie, I mean.."  "So buy me a drink, I'll letcha school me" nodding back toward the empty table. Clearly she was good - good enough that all the locals scattered; nobody wants to play her. Still busy rifling through the pockets of the coat, Penny refolds the headphones inside one of the pair of pockets, half looking over her shoulder at Devros "Go on, hey? Something girly," she stresses, at once laconic and louche "with an umbrella."  The business of setting up the table again is Penny's alone. There isn't even one empty mug or bottle for her to bug the waitress about.  Aaron blinks at Cathy and gets up from the tbar with his drink. He smiles, 'Sorry , love...can't stand beer..'  Aaron gets up from the barstools. Catherine takes a seat at the barstools. Catherine shrugs She says something in a language you don't understand.  She sits so she can watch the game that seems to be starting She says something in a language you don't understand.  Aaron takes a seat at the barstools.  Devros blinks in surprise after her first statement, caught somewhat off guard. "..well, that was..straight forward.." He grins, flicking the cigarette butt aside and placing his bottle on the table in front of him. "Oh..right..something girly..with an umbrella..Ok.." He nods to himself a few times. "..I can offer some beer..Cuz, you know..We're out of umbrellas..and girly drinks..." He casts a glance over his shoulder, sizing the couple of strangers briefly, and then gesturing to Chuck, ordering the usual. "..Just don't mind the funny taste.."  Catherine looks after Aaron as he heads into the the bathroom, sitting alone on the chair, swaying her legs and sipping the beer. A blush and a smile as Devros looks her way, then just waits.  Penny racks up stacking in some obscure and arcane numbering order, rolls the triangle forward a few times then finger-tightens the group; no room to move. While she waits for Devros to get back with the drinks, chalking her cue again Penny reaches back into the depths of a corner pocket for the cue ball. She polishes it against her thigh, grime twisting off it in her hand.  Chuck actually makes his way to the pool table, fetching her a pitcher of good ol' Canadian beer and a glass mug before wandering back to his dirty bar. "So, let's just go to the standard questions..", Devros asks, taking a sip from his own bottle. "Do you come here often?"  Perfunctory and effective enough to keep Penny interested, she nods "..but not enough to make a living at it," and she smiles. It's true. Chuck knows her, gives her a hey-what's-up but not much more. Chuck also knows she's dead-serious most of the time. She picks up a mug, wipes it out with the edge of one of her shirts and pours "Next?"  Catherine stays on her stool, but starting to watch the exchange by the pool table more intently.  "Hey, that's good to know." he says, although his tone of voice doesn't make it obvious he meant it. "Hmhmk..Lesse.." Devros looks upwards, thinking to himself. "Okies then, how about your name? Or alias..I don't really care..Just want to keep track of your tabs..", he shrugs lightly.  Drinking while Devros ponders, Penny rounds the corner of the table sweeping out stray bottlecaps from underfoot. "It's Penny." She says that with a kind of telling finality - that it's entirely possible she doesn't care who he is and won't be offering more than that.  "Well then Penny, it's good to meet another face to our humble shithole..", he smiles, brightly at first, but that rapidly fades. "..and lacking any sort of originality, that's pretty much all I have.." Devros chuckles, slipping his hands back down the side pockets. "Next time you're around, bring some cash..I'm sure ripping off these idiots is a profitable side job, but I mean, where's the fun in that?"  Well, since Aaron seems to be gone like, forever Cathy slips off the chair. Sipping her drink.. "Now's the part where you offer me a cigarette," pouring herself another mug "and tell me your name. And then I tell you 'I'm really not in it for the money, it's how I get my kicks' and then we play." Threading the needle of her stance, she's remarkably still. Lower to the table, bending and leaning just so, Penny focuses down the stroking line and exhales, shoots the cue and the loud crack of a clean break splits out.  Still narrating to Devros, Penny watches the balls roll and knock into eachother "And then you tell me 'I don't know if I really feel like playing now' and then I kinda give you this look and wait for a light and I ask 'So why is it I should bring cash?' And you say.." leaving the opening there.  "...Because..of my good looks..? C'mon, that's a tricky question.." He quirks a brow, grabbing the pack from his pocket and tossing on the table. There are only two cigarettes left. "You can keep some greens in your back pocket. A couple of hundreds, maybe? Then whenever I'm around, we play..I'd be more then willing now, but it was a long day, and the kids must be missing me, so..Will have to bring the extra cash on a later occasion.." Devros sighs heavily, turning and making his way across the room, back to the entrance. "Oh..right..Name's Devros..", is said along the way.  Penny fishes out a cigarette, picking off a lighter from someone else nearby. Sure, that was normal. "Pussy," she murmurs around the smoke with a hard glare at the path Devros' parts, tossing the stick to the table.  That about sums it up for Penny. She pulls her things together, headphones go back around her neck, trench gets remantled and sashed gingerly .. for whatever reason.

      Aftermath... So, I diddn't see any of the sabbat poses but I thought I'd leave 'em in for humor value.   Absently Chase hands over the kicker, still some red fluid to inject. "Hit that. Main line it, cabrone. We'll get... we'll get... the rest a you lot over..." Starting to get woozy, eyes close. His other nostril starts bleeding.  Wether its the sound of his name, or that scent in the air.. Dave scampers back and forth on the Dr's lap. The monkey takes the shot and injects the willing Dr, then suckles at the wound briefly. Its electrifying, the Monkey falling back onto the floor with a thump where he starts convulsing and shaking with the grin of one who is terrifyingly euphoric.  More twitching. A smirk shows Chase's coffee stained teeth even as his bloodshot eyes are closed to remain together. Something else is grabbed automatically within arm's reach, as if greedy fingers knew just where it was. A yellow pill for plain lips. "Sub... Subspactial ward. Walls." It's popped back to fend for it's self in with the gum. And duly, Chase nudges you to take more. "Crunch up, Doc. 'S final.... final piece."  Pobble kicks back, twitching and nudging the monkey with his foot. Dave doesn't seem to care, lost in some unholy caress. The empty shot is placed on a nearby surface and the last drag of the cigarette is taken down. "So. He have any chums left in the trads?"  Pobble says "P - Reaching into the ashtray, Pobble possibly continues to stare at Chase waiting for a response while thumbing out some Ash. Mixing this with the blood seeping from his palm he grabs a nearby book and trails the thin ooze over the cover in a twisting pattern. It's not terribly viscous so this takes a while, but Chase is otherwise occupied so.. Once the pictogram is complete its not even really recognizable, just a smear. Still. The chemicals in his head elevate the illusion somewhat and he mouths a single word in a language Chase doesn't understand. "Walls." says the Dr, in Enochian.  A - Mind 1. Shield. T - The image and the word, reverberate inside the psyche of the Dr, dragging along the psychotropic drug effects and twisting them into upperplane clouds across the subconscious. Blocking the mind from outside influences as a thunderstorm blocks the sun. Not terribly accurate or stylish, but perhaps worth the effort."  //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 1 success(es). //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s). //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 2 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Dr Steve leans forward and inexplicably licks the markings off the book before settling back once more with a somewhat perplexed smile and once more nuding the monkey with his foot.  Chase is still in the zone, eyes closed tight like they were keeping out bright sunlight. *Pop* Chewing in the same robotic pace. "Yeahhh. Right. Just under there." That didn't answer the Doc's question very well, but it's all he could muster at the moment.   P - Chase stands languidly, pushing himself up with lazy effort. His red eyes finally opens and he takes this moment to adjust his nuts. A look about the room, he's nodding something to himself. A canister is grabbed from the chem tins, looks akin to a smoke grenade. It's walked to the center of the room and the pin is pulled whilst Chase scratches his scalp. The faint smell of oranges start to permeate the air as a colorless gas leaks out.   Cor 4 (remove room from the spacial continuum for a duration.)   T - The gas is a conduit for the Cor foci Chase has already ingested, it's gonna draw his avatar out into the air, and dislocate this room from the rest of the world, creating their own special pocket of reality."

      From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah says simply "We don't need to talk do we? I mean, to communicate, we can talk with our hands right?" From Derelict Home - Main Room, Keeping his voice low Dar glances over the party, looking over to Micah once and nodding, "These Mages. They use spells and such?" He makes a motion to his lips as if thinking about them speaking these 'spells'. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Dean has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah nods From Derelict Home - Main Room, "They fuck shit up." Vulture hisses low, flooding blood into his veins to strengthen his limbs and his skin. Both knives are held easily at his sides, "Can bring fire'n sunlight without even wavin' a wand." Wow, how does he know all this cool stuff. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon slips quietly and discretly into the building from the second story, descending from the roof into the building with a practiced ease. The room is pitch black and dark (I'm assuming. No one is setting the scene here) but his small glowing eyes reveal everything behind his sunglasses, and he moves to press himself flag against the wall. (I'm assuming ALOT here) From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim looks to Micah, nods, and the idea passes clearly between the two clan mates. Quiet will be the word of the day. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim slips into the shadows, obsuring himself from others sight and mind. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Takes a few steps into the shadows, and doesnt seem to step back out... From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Dichotic eyes slip back and forth as Vulture watches his comrades disappear. Yup, he's left in plain sight. Gripping the handles of the knives tighter, he lets out a whispered sound of exasperation, "Fuuuuuuuuuck." From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon slides along the wall to the edge of the door frame. He waits there for a while, listening carefully. Not having to breathe comes in handy in these sort of situations, to pick out those who do. Not hearing anything (I'm assuming again), He slowly pokes his head around, and takes stock of the very empty hallway. Its very empty alright. He slides into the hallway, crouching low along the ground and slowly stalks to the next room, every muscle twitched. His strnage furry ears twitch a bit when he hears some cussing from down below, and he takes note of it. God damn scrub. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Into his own form of stealth mode, the Birdman crouches low to the floor of the room. His eyes scan the corners and he swallows, perhaps for the last time, before he holds his breath - no point in doing anything in the slightest... well... besides what he's done... to make noise. Arms cocked, knives pointing out the bottom of his grip, he advances towards the stairwell. Nice and slow. Of course, he doesn't know where anyone else is, which gives his movements a lack of definition. Almost seeming nervous. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon slowly rights himself, and moves over to the next closed door in the hallway, pressing up flat against the wall yet again. His powers of deception aren't as advanced some, but if remains still enough he becomes practicly invisible. He uses this to his advantage as he listens to any sounds from beyond the next door. Nothing (Assumption!). He waits even longer, and then ever so slowly taps the door open. It makes a slow creeking sound as it opens, and reveals more nothing. From Derelict Home - Main Room, At the creak that whispers down from upstairs, the Toreador shifts his position. He doesn't have animal ears, but damn is his hearing sharp. For a moment he just looks up at the ceiling - then remembers where Simon went. Centering himself he looks down the stairs and then lets out his breath nice and slow. With one tenative step he puts his foot on the first stair - preparing to descend into what could be the gates of hell for all he knows. Wicked blades held at the ready. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon suddenly appears creeping down the stairwell, quiet as a mouse, but highly visable to anyone who can see. Well, if you can see in the dark. He holds up a hand to Vulture, and motions to him that the upstairs is clear. Sabbat hand signals are alot like the ones the Navy Seals use, just alot cooler. His eyes scan the room, and then he signs, "Clear?" From Derelict Home - Main Room, One good hand signal; Vulture pops two big thumbs up after he manages to avoid shitting his pants at Simon's appearance. Of course, he's not quite able to have a bowel movement... but the look in his eyes says 'Simon, you utter BASTARD!'. Then he points with both index fingers down the stairs and gives a shrug of his shoulders - Should I go down? Seems to be his question.  Back to the comfort of the leather chair. Chase returns, more goodies. He's going scar-face tonight, eh? Another handful of capsules are procured from a tin on the lab table and they get crunched right after the punk spits his green gum out. He's need his jaw muscles for a few minutes. Crunch, munch, bunch, a yellowy foam builds at the side of his lips. Eyes roll back, he wipes his lips.   After a moment or two of steady delirium, "Oi. Cheeky, rude little faggots. Got a few foxes 'n the hen house... Dead ones."  From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon motions for the big brute to hold. He then does the feasibly insane, and slowly creeps down to the door to the basement and repeats the same proceedure as up above. He attempts to take notice of any tripwires and what not, but you can never prepare enough for this sort of thing. When he arrives at the bottom of the stairs, he pauses and holds completely still. If you weren't stairing at him before, you don't see him now. And he listens.  Pobble sits up, ears almost twitching. "Crapweasels." he murmers hazily. Again the foot to the Monkey. "Oi. Dave. Maybe you should pop sideways and tell the other cunts to get the hell out of Dodge. But away from here." He smirks, sitting up and wobbling a little, tapping his silver fingernails together with a metallic 'thwink'.  Shifting of the surfaces could indicate that Dr Steve is looking about, for something maybe.  From Derelict Home - Main Room, Vulture wanted to be the first one to go down! The huffy look he gets on his face says so. Resigned to being the less cool of the pair that are visible, the Birdman begins his descent behind his Packmate, blades held at the ready; set to rend flesh with his sharp, metal, instruments. Not surgeon's steel... but he's going to do some damage if he manages to hit someone. Each step is calculated as he places it on each stair. Slowly slipping down behind Simon without a peep. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon doesn't hear anything (Assumption). He then holds up 3 fingers in the air, initating a simple countdown. He then slowly grabs ahold of the door nob, and looks up the stairwell at Vulture. The last thing he does before he starts the countdown is wink, fangs and red eyes gleaming. Yeeeeehaw!  "Got some Windex and Lysol mate?" says Dr Steve after a second.  "Mmmmmm." Chase starts to look around as his eyes open again. "Yeah. Prolly. Somewhere... mebbe I should just give all a mental nudge, eh Dave don't gotta worry his furry lil' ass over this..."  From Derelict Home - Main Room, Taking note of the three count, Vulture almost seems to vibrate with excitement. Women all over the world would... uh... nevermind. Flowing his vitae into his nerve centres he prepares to move quick as a whip. Blades held at the ready. Its GO time.

      Part 3. Wouldn't let me do it as one.   From Derelict Home - Main Room, There is a rustle, and the sound of footsteps as Micah steps out from the shadows... From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah has arrived.  Chase turns his head before a response is forthcoming. "Oi. The bunker. There's a spirit in there, eh? That's how they found this pad. Doc Steve." The punk gains a moment of froathy clearity. "Yer good with them spirit types, right?"  Pobble moves to his feet, ignorant of the new arrivals and mozies over to the kitchen area. Fumbling about underneath he grabs a bucket, places it upright next to the cupboard. "Not a clue mate, That'd be Penny.." Looking into the cupboard he queries, "Think we can drop off a present?"  From Derelict Home - Main Room, Eventually, Karl appears, coming in from back outside. "Somehow, they've... escaped. Or hidden themselves. We may as well go home." From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah shrugs "Course we could always burn this sucker down...that way the night wasn't a total waste"  Chase makes a face, and turns to the bunker door again, fingering his cleft chin. "What ta do, eh?"  From Derelict Home - Main Room, A sillouetted outline appears at first. Fuzzy, indistinct, as if your mind is attempting to wrap itself around the existance of whatever it is. The cobwebs of the Obfuscate are shaken from the mind as Darjims hold on the blood is released, giving him shape and form. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim has arrived. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Slightly behind and beside Karl comes a gigantic swirling mass of obtenebration, the head is translucent so determining who it is might be more then alittle difficult, arms of blackness writhing and twitching like snakes as they remain at his, it's, sides. One could safely assume the shadow monster is Dean.  Pobble waggles his fingernails. "Nitro G." he says, and begins to pour random household products into the bucket.  From Derelict Home - Main Room, "I don't think they'd notice, honestly," Karl notes, with a shrug. "I have my ideas. We may just tell their friends a few more things about them, and what they did tonight, and see if that gets them dealt with. But me, I'm going home." From Derelict Home - Main Room, A frown flows over the lips of the Birdman, "What... you mean, they aren't downstairs at all?" His hands twirl the blades he's carrying around a couple of times. His eyes slip from Karl, to shadowy Dean, back to Karl again, "So... like... this whole thing was for nothing?" Yup, that's disappointment, folks. Another twirl, and he slides the blades into hidden sheathes on his legs. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah puts his Kukri back in his pants, and says "Well, fuck it, I aint all for messing with things I don't understand anyway." He looks around to his packmates "Whatdaya say we go chase one of those rickshaw thingies down and do something wrong with it?" From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim glances around the room carefully after coming out of the shadows, his own blade getting replaced in it's sheath around his back. He says nothing, his eyes scanning the room slowly before they fall on the exit. It would appear that it is time to leave then. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon is right by the door to the basement, counting down 3 fingers. Appearantly the kids were still in the process of clearing the building. He frowns, and stands upright. He removes his hand from the knob, and moves up the stairs with a sulk. His claws remain extended, and he glances over at Vultrue. "Pup, what are you doing? Someone is going to die tonight for all this trouble. I don't care who anymore." His voice is more on a growl, and with that he stalks out the door. You get the sense he's going to kill the first 3 people he sees. Its been that sort of night, and conversation isn't going to sate this bloodlust. From Derelict Home - Main Room, "They moved, somehow. They were there, and then they were not there." That is all Karl has to say. "And they're probably beyond our reach now. I'm simply going home. I'll deal with the later." That said, he simply starts on his way out. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim shrugs and as well moves out of the house. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim leaves the house. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah just shakes his head "Im going to get a fucking cup of coffee...and throw it at someone..." From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah leaves the house. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, "Pup?" Vulture mutters indignantly as Simon stalks away. With a frown on his lips he gives the Gangrel a nickname, too, "Cock!" Then he lets out a snarl, and notes his whole pack is buggering off, and heads out after them with a brisk movements, "Guys... hang on... I got an idea..." Oh yeah, like the punk has anything worthwhile in his head.  You say, "Its the perfect gift." He stops, looking into the bucket and pondering. This doesn't last as Windex and Lyson have a somewhat overpowering smell, causing him to step back. Wobbly. Looking over to see Dave still lying on the floor, Dr Steve sighs. "You useless fuck.""  From Derelict Home - Main Room, Vulture leaves the house. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Vulture has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon leaves the house. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Simon has left.  Chase says, "Airy thingy... just whispin' about in the bunker still. Mebbe we should give P-Diddy a call, eh? 'Fore we come out. Get her to banish this lil' bugger."  From Derelict Home - Main Room, Karl leaves the house. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Karl has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Dean leaves the house. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Dean has left.  Pobble is still recoiling from the noxious clean smell of the bucket, and just manages to lift it up and pour the contents down the sink. No one seems overly impressed with his drug addled plan and it sucks the motivation out of him. He stands there, bucket upturned and wobbling for a few moments. "Go 'head" he mumbles, dropping the bucket noisily and lighting up a new smoke.

      P - Well, since Chase is the lead in this particular dance, he'll be concocting a special  brew of new fun chemi-yummies for Pobs to taste. There's gonna kick back, turn on the TV,  smoke sblue colored powder and think about shit -real- hard.   A - Cor 2/Prime 2 (Plasma Death)   T - Chase is opening Pobs up to a new path of Avatar relations, one not steeped in his  particular hermetic style. It's a self attunement that's rather baseless, but seems to tap  into the core just the same. Only nonspecific methods, none charted by previous magi.  Still chemical foci, as Pobs uses, just going about it's business in roads. Chase will  take Pob's avatar energy with him via the Cor foci, showing him distance and spacial  relatives. Then, the prime kicker will activate, and we'll send over plasma bolts into his  fuckin' brain."     Cassius says "17 total... hmm, minus the four... carry the 87... comes out to  about... 26 health levels."  Pobble sits back, chews and repeatedly drags on an unlit cigarette. The repetition seems  to calm him and he stares off into the distance, with an expression that seems to be  slowly melting. The monkey on his lap looks up at him with sad blue eyes, holding onto one  of his hands and gently poking at the holes in his hands, as if trying to remind the  missing Deity of where to go to unleash its holy wrath on the crossfucking nonbeliever.   This is the zone Chase was telling you about. Static hissing in the background,  meth-sulfate mix hitting your spine. The thick man's in his plush chair in much the same  spell Pobs is. Some sweat beading upon his shaved scalp and gum chewing to some internal  clockwise beat. Every five point seven seconds, he remembers to breath and blink all at  once. Veins straining on his horse neck,he finally blows a bubble. *POP*   "You feel, it eh. Como que no. Dios." A single bead of sweat drips from Pobble's nose onto the monkey who scratches at his head  and goes to say something but thinks the better of it. Something in the air causes its fur  to bristle just a touch and an expectant grin begins to form on its lips. The smell of  paradox on the wind, the smell of the mother of all highs.  "Indubidably." murmers the good Doctor, silver fingernails glinting as he continues the  motion with precise timing. Sucking the cigarette, sucking the essence of Yahwe back to  his oh so hollow skull and a non lonely place. Angsty longing for the missing godhead  causes a twitch on his lip between drags, but it vanishes, succumbing to a merry sigh and  a moment with closed eyes.   Twitches start, like a cink in the system, one of Chase's lazy eyes squints up and  releases. "Yeah. Fuckin' yeah." Chin up when he looks to the skies, obscured by layers of  earth, concrete and mortar. "I just keep chewing." To nothing in particular as callused  hands shake up a glass vile containing reddish liquid. He inserts it into an air injection  unit and raises it behind his ear. "Grounded kicker. It's the universe's spike, cabrone."  The unit bites his skin with a hiss.    "Dave gotta stay with me next week....p... pu.... puto." Chase let's out a whisper.   A lighter is drawn from somewhere, its chrome muddied with blood from Steve's hand. He has  'em and he'll smoke em. Eyes that would be bloodshot if they weren't purest white flutter  and the man lets out a sigh as he exhales that first sweet drag. "I'm not heading anyplace  anytime soon fucker. Not safe outside by my reakoning."   Absently Chase hands over the kicker, still some red fluid to inject. "Hit that. Main line  it, cabrone. We'll get... we'll get... the rest a you lot over..." Starting to get woozy,  eyes close. His other nostril starts bleeding.  Wether its the sound of his name, or that scent in the air.. Dave scampers back and forth  on the Dr's lap. The monkey takes the shot and injects the willing Dr, then suckles at the  wound briefly. Its electrifying, the Monkey falling back onto the floor with a thump where  he starts convulsing and shaking with the grin of one who is terrifyingly euphoric.

      You walk down the hill and through the small valley, approaching Novus Valnastium. As you crest the next large hill, you arrive, opening the door and heading into... Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers     Penny shouts, "Daaaaisy, Daaaaaaisy" it's a sing songy, girly voice "give me your answer, do. I'm half craaazy..."          Two massive, dark-finished oaken doors, rimmed and lined in silver and steel. Through them lie the Council Chambers of Novus Valnastium.  Nearby, a female voice shouts, "Well, hell. If it ain't Penny Dreadful."  You open the double doors, heading into the Main Hall beyond. Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber          This room is mostly empty, even more vast in some ways than the hall outside. Only three things mar its granite perfection; an immense marble table at the head of the room with nine chairs, each marked with a single Sphere glyph, an intricately inscribed Certamen circle in the center of the room, and perhaps forty seats at the back of the room, for observers and audience. A single door to the left glows a soft gold.         The great marble table seems to be carved from a single piece of stone. Polished and pristine, the table stands as if it had stood here for an eternity, its circle unbroken and complete. Each seat surrounding it is spaced evenly, as if meticulous care has been given toward seeking this state of equality.         The room is lit by a multitude of dim fires which rest in recessed pits along the walls. Here and there, candelabras stand, adding additional light to the chamber through their infinitely burning candles.                            >                           Contents: Daisy Niko Supplies Obvious exits: Left Door  Out   Penny pushes open one of the massive oak doors with her shoulder, kind of backing into it. Her hands are occupied, you see. Duct tape, a dark duffel bag. She's dragging a huge roll of industrial packing plastic. From the look of the dirt and grass divets caked up around the base, it's taken her a while. She's even a little out of breath.  "I've been looking everywhere for you."  "What, so I can schlep stuff around for you?"  Daisy is standing midroom, one hand jammed wrist-deep in her hoodie pocket,the other one holding her cigarette up to her lips. Long tangles of black hair hang down over her face.  Niko glances over at Penny, "You are a very fortunate young lady....I'd dare say you don't know how much so...". He shakes his head softly and then looks at Daisy and reaches in his back pocket and pulls out his wallet, fanning out 3 hundreds, "This help you get what you need?"  Penny watches the business without interrupting. She's used to waiting. And when it seems appropriate, Penny deadpans at Niko "Yeah. I heard they had me, too. But it's cool. It's cool" picking dirt out of her hair, kicking rocks out of her shoes "I got friends over there, friends over there too."  She props her things in the way of the door to keep it open, leans on the roll of plastic.  Eyes glittering with the craven hunger of the chronically impovershed, Daisy just stares -- unblinking -- at the money. Then, long fingers flexing, she flicks forward to take it.  "Yeah," she says casually, bobbing her head. "That's definitely enough to get me started. An' I suppose I'm in charge of being started, being, as I am, Friday and all. An' being Friday, an' Friday being the Sabbath, I ain't got to schlep shit for you, Penny. Unless of course it's for a good cause. Talmud says I can schlep shit for charity."  For a moment, she scowls.  "Keene totally nailed me on that point last week."  Niko arches a brow and shakes his head a little as if he's trying to fathom something about you all, "And to think..3 years ago..I would have asked to join your litle group..". He smirks a bit and moves back to the circle, 'Don't take any of Alex's shit...he'll be more pissed off than he already is and I don't need him thinking about anything but pissing off the Union with me..'  Squinting, Daisy holds one of the hundred-dollar bills up to the light, then turns it over and examines the other side. She gets to examine real currency far, far too infrequently.  "We don't want to be sowin' no discord in Q Division," says Daisy. "Don't worry -- if there's anything at all Daisy Inscrutable's good at, it's keepin' the peace."  Penny looks Daisy over like maybe there's something wrong, incorrect perceptions; reception isn't coming in clear. She looks Daisy over, mouth twisted shut, eyes on the money. Purpose.  "You're taking applications? I thought our roster was full. Plus we gotta get this shit started, bein'as it's five in the goddam and it won't cook itself. Plus, y'know .. you're Friday," indicating the roll to Daisy. An introduction, an invitation.  Kicking her boots against the roll of plastic again, Penny scratches her nails across her jeans, flicking out sand. Or salt. Something that makes noise when it hits the stone floor.  "Us plus Voodoo Eddie plus Eva plus the Eighth Day means we're full up," agrees Daisy, turning her back on Niko and slouching over to the sheeting. Delicately, she pushes it with the tip of her toe, waiting it for to rebound. Her expression passes through a dozen permutations of uncomfortable. "I think we're good with what we got now, P. I mean, there's always the possibility that --"  Eyes, hooded, jerk from Penny to a point just over her shoulder.   "-- I mean, you know what there's a possibility of. That ain't a good possibility."  Niko settles back in the center of the Certamen Circle and puts his laptop back on his legs, 'I don't want to join, ladies....I'm just trying to remember when I was like you both are..'  "You used to be a stupid cunt that wanted me to carry a big bloody roll of plastic on the Sabbath?", Daisy asks sweetly.  They commiserate quietly, the girls. It's this thing they do, talking with their eyes.  And Penny doesn't look happy, no, not pleased at all. "..but it's the rules,.." she hisses "We have to at least try. It's what, I mean it's not just the principle of the thing, it's the fucking letter."  A guarded glance at Niko "I'm serious, I didn't want any trouble. That shit, Alex? He doesn't know man.  Niko smirks a little at Penny and shrugs, "Neither did I..and you can see what it got me.."  Penny, uncomfortable in the doorway, broken-records "Yeah. Uh. So where's the body." She touches the edge of the plastic, tip-tip-flicking a corner between thumb and forefinger. Shrugging up her shoulder, the question merely perfunctory.   "Figure I can ask and you can tell me."  Niko shakes his head, "I have no idea...I didn't ask...but you're not going to get it..and I have a feeling if you don't return that head soon....all hell's gonna break loose.  Deer-in-headlights. Daisy literally locks up with indecision, unmoving for a second.  "I suppose it's charity," she says when she thaws.  Penny arches a brow, the left one, the one that can be seen. She says, in Enochian, "Daze, y'ever get the feeling you're just not being heard?"  Reaching into one of the apron pockets on her hip, Penny digs out a scissor and puts her wrist through the roll of duct tape. She says, in Enochian, "Come on, this is pointless."  Niko glances to Penny, "I'll run that through the universal translator later..". He looks to Daisy, "If you're sure I can't help....then just let me know what you need...I'll see what I can do instead of having you poke around Alex's stuff.  Daisy's brows knit up and her lips start to move slowly. It's obvious that she only vaguely understands the language that Penny was speaking in. After a moment, she sort of nods, shrugs, and mumbles, "Thanks, Aaron. I mean it. But I gotta go."  Penny gives Daisy the scissor in between some complicated gesture, her thumb and pinky fingers spread out. Kicking the door off the roll of plastic, she holds it open.  "Don't run with those."  Daisy takes the scissors. Daisy holds the scissors. Daisy is obviously trying to puzzle out what you said just a moment ago in Enochian, and not doing so well. If you can read lips, you can see her going through the rather arbitrary declinations of the word 'nowhere'.  Half of them are wrong.   Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Contents: Rhiamon Abel Paksenarrion Connelly Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers      Abel heads through the double doors, entering the Main Hall beyond. Abel has left.  Rhiamon is following after Abel.. Rhiamon heads through the double doors, entering the Main Hall beyond. Rhiamon has left.  Daisy arrives from the forward doors. Daisy has arrived.  Daisy and Penny are just leaving as, apparently, the entire population of the Chantry starts to head through into the Council Chambers. The former has a pair of scissors in one hand and a cigarette in the other; the latter has a giant roll of plastic sheeting behind her. Neither offers an explanation.  Paksenarrion looks at the giant sheet of plastic, "Off to desicrate more bodies?"  Lugging along slowly, Penny and Daisy are going over a few things. "The fourth  doesn't apply in cases of the personal. Like affronts or insults. But if you just conjugate with a verb like I did? it works. Cig me," a polite request as they walk "I'm only taking this as far as the next door then it's all you."  Daisy dips into her center pocket to cig Penny. "What door?", she asks.  Abel arrives from the forward doors. Abel has arrived.  Abel comes out of the main Chamber, heading toward the doors out of the keep.  Daisy and Penny are just leaving as, apparently, the entire population of the Chantry starts to head through into the Council Chambers. The former has a pair of scissors in one hand and a cigarette in the other; the latter has a giant roll of plastic sheeting behind her. Neither offers an explanation.  Abel looks at the two woman curiously. "Hey. What's up?"  "We're workin' on something," Daisy says cryptically, snapping her scissors in Abel's direction. "You'll see soon. Don' worry."  Abel holds his hands up defensively as the scissors snapp at him. "Sure."  "Eight days," Daisy says flatly.  Abel says, "Eight days till what?"  "That one," pointing Daisy at the library. She gets a sharpie out of her bag, bites off the cap and holds it there between her teeth. She starts writing on the duct tape, scribing circles, slashes, points on an axis. "Eight days," she repeats like it should be obvious enough. Matter of fact she's just like those annoying chain-store jingles that keep reminding you how many days there are til Christmas. "Eight days," tearing of that section. It gets slapped to the plastic sheet.  Daisy is not quite so cryptic.  "Eight days 'til you find out," she murmurs, eyes flicking to Abel for just a moment. Shivering and sober, she stands behind Penny's right shoulder, watching. Waiting. "Eight days 'til everyone finds out what we're up to. You'll love it."  Abel doesn't look too sure of that. "Eight days huh? Does this have something to do with Chase?" He stays a short distance away from the two women, obviously unsure how to interact with them. He glances at Daisy, noticing the state she's in. "Are you all right Daisy?"  "Don't worry, Abel. It's not a violation of the Council's order. I'm over that. We're just in planning."  As Abel speaks, Daisy wrinkles up her nose and bobs her head. You can see aftershocks -- muscle tremors -- across her shoulders and back. They're obviously uncomfortable.  "I'm just comin' down off of somethin'. It's ... not so good."  Abel nods to Penny and then to Daisy. "Believe it or not... I know," he says quietly.  "She's fine," an offhand comment, not really concerned. It's most likely that Penny's seen Daisy in far worse shape. "I'm fine. We're all fine except him. He's dead and you can't even help us honor him. Why are you letting Alex hide his body anyway? What's it to you?" This is rhetoric, these are complaints.  Tearing through the tape, Penny's fingers get stuck. "Cut that into about three headless Chase's," chinning to the plastic.  Snip. Snip. Snip.  "Don't worry about Penny," Daisy contradicts, giving Abel a look of genuine concern. Tic. Tic. Up goes the corner of her lip, but it's not a sneer; it's a twitch, and one she can't do anything about. "She's strung out. We're all a little strung out. Since Chase went out, we've been ... too much."  It's obvious what she's been too much of.  Abel blinks to Penny and nods to Daisy again. "I don't know where Alex has put the body. I wasn't around for it. And how are you honoring Chase? You guys never tell anybody what you're doing. You simply do your thing that nobody else understands. And then you expect us all to just... to just get it." He runs a hand through his hair in frustration. "And I think you like it that way."  "That's true," says Daisy contemplatively. Halfway done, she finishes cutting and looks up, red-rimmed eyes on Abel. "Would you like us to tell you more? We could tell you things, if we could find Hod. It's Hod's job to tell you things."  Penny is mapping out a lattice of tape. It looks like a net, the long lines of silver half stuck to the floor, criss-crossing. Fencing. On hands and knees Penny marks up the tape and starts pulling out tiny things from her pockets; copper wires, bay leaves, jet pebbles, bitter herbs. These things remain in a pile beside the near-complete sticky frame.  "No. Hod is not Keene."  "Okay, help me flip this over sticky and then put that" she points to the plastic "on this."  "Keene is the best Hod. Keene is deeply Hod," Daisy explains, carefully taking up one end of the net, carefully turning it over, and carefully lowering it onto the aforementioned plastic sheeting. She looks up at Penny expectantly, lip caught between her teeth, before continuing. "There's seven of us. There're seven days. There're seven Sephirot reflected upon the face of the supernal crown, Kether. Each of us, each of the members, is a day, a Sephirot, a name. Today I'm Friday, the Sabbath. Now, the Sabbath doesn't do any work, 'cause the Sabbath is head of the cabal, just as Eheveh rules the world and the father is the head of the house. Today Penny is Monday. Monday is more cryptic than the rest of us, because Monday is above the language of intelligences."  Her smile is wan, but still a smile.  "Be glad you ain't talkin' to Da'ath. Da'ath is silent, and a bitch to boot."  Abel smiles a little and moves to help keep the plastic and tape from getting caught where it isn't supposed to go. "Here, let me help. I really need to read up more on my Kabbalah."  Penny stops with a sharp intake of breath waiting there. And it issues forth in little put-put noises when she drops a corner for Abel to pick up since he wants to help.  Her gestures are slowing down, becoming more fluid. It's possible her facilities and acuity are leaving her.  "Now. Turn it over and litter the shroud with safe passage, enlightenment and sacrafice."  The pile, her eyes fix on the pile. The bay leaves, the bitter herbs, the jet. Who knows what the copper wire is for. Better leave it out.  Of course, it's plastic. It's duct tape. It's a rock. It's a leaf. It's silly, and it's not going to work.  Daisy is a mage because she has learned to ignore these things. Closing her eyes, she takes up the bay, scattering the sharp-spined herbs across the duct tape and plastic. Then the green-brown curls of herb, scattered carefully across the same area. Then, finally, the jet stones, which clack and clatter across the shroud beneath her hand. She's whispering a gutteral, inarticulate prayer underneath her breath, choking back sobs.  You always swear in the language of your birth. You always grieve in the religion of your parents.  Abel stands back and watches. He understands something is being done... something for Chase... and he bows his head in prayer as well.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 2 success(es).  Abel prays under his breath "Eternal rest grant unto him oh Lord, and may perpetual light shine upon him.  Penny rests back on her heels. "And when they give us his body, we'll wrap him up and take him in among us," vacant-eyed she stares at a vanishing point. Head tilted to the side, her eyes go wide and slack. Swaying and rocking like some ecstatic, she might faint.  OOC> Penny says "awareness rolls if you're feelin'it."  Daisy's shoulders are tense, and her expression is hard, and she's staring at the shroud on the verge of crying.  "We will," she murmurs, "and our will is become flesh."  That's not something she would normally say, and it's lacking her characteristic insecure, gutterish diction.  Rhiamon arrives from the forward doors. Rhiamon has arrived.  Abel puts a hand on Daisy's shoulder comfortingly but doesn't say anything. Rhiamon enters from the Council chamber, yawning.  It's all on Penny, the energy, the resonance. This is clearly a meditation and you know she'll be here for hours. Another facet of the fasting, perhaps. She's made this little spot, the shroud and all part of a temporary domain. By touching it, the plastic, you can sense her presence and know if you stay there that your will could be subverted to her own.  Daisy, Abel, and Penny are clustered around three pieces of plastic sheeting, each roughly man-sized and man-shaped. A matrix of duct tape has been overlaid on each. The thick, pungent smell of asafoetida, fennel leaves, and horseradish rises from her. Baby leaves of romaine lettuce are scattered with jet stones and bay leaves.  Penny, kneeling, is sheened in an oracular sweat, eyes rolling up under closed eyelids, taut muscles vibrating with effort. There's no clear indication of what she's doing.  Rhiamon blinks, but doesn't interupt what is going on.  Abel turns and moves away from the powereful magicks and resonance of Penny's working, not wanting to get caught up in it. He remains quiet, contemplative.  Rhiamon mouths a greeting to Abel, and waves with a smile  Daisy stands without a word, and walks, straight-backed, out of the keep.  Daisy opens the two double doors leading out to the plains, leaving to enter the plains beyond. Daisy has left.  Abel smiles to back to Rhiamon with a bit of a shrug, and heads out of the keep as well, gesturing to Rhiamon to follow and remain quiet. Rhiamon nods, and picks her way over.  Abel opens the two double doors leading out to the plains, leaving to enter the plains beyond. Abel has left. Rhiamon opens the two double doors leading out to the plains, leaving to enter the plains beyond. Rhiamon has left.

      Penny was here before you. She's been here for days. It's been days.  It's a pretty day. The sun is shining. Penny sits indian-style at the peak of a hill, her back to the fields, her back to the tall swaying grasses and the peace that might come in quiet contemplation. She watches the forest, hands in her pockets. It's possible she hasn't showered since she got here. It's been days.  Days since that day.  It's a pretty day. The sky is blue and the sun is shining.  Cresting the hill, Pig-boy comes shuffling down the embarkment; footing unsure; stumbling, really. No master of stealth, he makes a great deal of noise in his approach - grass rustling, dirt and rocks cascading ahead of him.  "Hey, uh -- Penny," he calls, or perhaps mumbles.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 4          For a total of 2 success(es).  In the area are familiar looking things. It's the partial contents of Penny's bag - sharpie markers, slips of paper, tampons, keys, a gun. You walked into this area, this little circle and the slide guy interrupts your vision, your sense of self. It feels like Penny in there and Penny wants to kill. Everything.  Easy to recognize, it's adrenaline and mescaline. It's pressure risen. It's blood in the veins and a tightness in the fists.  "I don't understand," she says with a distant tongue.  "...nothing to understand," answers Hiro, crossing the invisible line between rolling elysian fields and Penny's personal hemisphere. The sun doesn't shine so brightly, here. The birds, untroubled and singing, a little more difficult to hear. He keeps his hands balled up in his pockets, stubbornly; a key element to his perpetual slouch. "He's dead. Motherfuckers killed'm. Thassit, right. And the people we're supposed to answer to, who're supposed to protect us and help us don't give a shit, as usual. They care about number one. As usual. Nothing new."  "Right," slow and contemplative "right." Decisive. "Grab those keys, hey?" And the markers, she probably means, too.  Good mescaline comes on slow. At present time Penny has no problem getting up, picking up things, dissolving that felt-presence. But things linger - the crisp sound of paper crumpling in her hand, the feel of cold metal in her hand, your hand.  Penny holds the gun. Safety on. Finger threaded through the trigger and around the handle. Little click.  "We're taking it out of here."  It. "You mean the body," Hiro observes, bending down to retrieve Penny's keys from the grass; a fistful of sharpies next. These things are held uselessly; offered up, as if an alternative to the gun. "We can't lug a corpse out of here, Penny."  Penny starts tramping down the hill, wading through the hip-deep grasses toward the big building over there. The only building, as it happens. Consider it a march; on the move with Penny. "They brought it in here. We're taking it out of here." An unspoken 'why not?' punctuating her reasoning. "It's got a sheet on it," like a sheet's enough. "It was enough for Caesar, it's enough for him. I have a plan."  Her stance, her posture is a challenge to the building itself. "We can't leave him here. Not with these cowards. They do him wrong."  Arriving at the doors of the Novus Valnastium Penny declares quietly "We're taking him out of here. Today is the sixteenth and the first day. On the ninth day we will celebrate him. The ninth day is the Bacchanalia."  Hiro falls into place behind Penny, his record bag jostling as he makes his way, stumbling, through the field. Whatever's in there, it's heavy. He lights a cigarette as he walks; hands cupped around the tip, butane continually going out in the artifical climate. He lights it only at considerable length.  This place wasn't designed for smokers; it was designed for throwbacks. Pig-Boy's expression attests this opinion; scowling around the filter.  "We can't just cart a corpse out of here, Penny," he insists.  "It's the end of the feast, Piggy."  She raises the gun, grips it with both hands and aims it at the doors. There's a good chance she doesn't know what she's doing, what she's aiming at.  "Our fasting begins right fucking now." Thumbing the safety off, she pulls the trigger. The bullet ricohets off the stones of the building, the distinctive smell of scorched air orbits and she walks into the building.  There is a certain instinctive response to gunfire, one you don't see in movies. The hard-asses never cringe at the report, at the explosion of cordite, the sharp sound of a bullet ricocheting off of stone, or the zip as it passes through the air.  Pig-Boy is no hard-ass; he ducks instinctively, as if this would save him from a stray round. "Fuck, Penny," is all he says. He still follows -- just gives himself a little more distance.  Connelly 's sitting on the floor in a corner of the room, reading some sort of  book...  A few seconds earlier a gunshot pierced the quiet.  Moments later comes the former statue-on-the-hill that was Penny. In her hands is a large gun and in her wake is Hiro armed only, somewhat impotently, with sharpie markers. She is making great strides across the hall toward the council chambers, offering the troops no quarter moving onward.  Abel arrives from the forward doors. Abel has arrived.  Abel comes out of the council Chambers, heading to ward the exit.  As if just now realizing his hands are full of sharpies, Hiro stuffs them away into a pocket of his labcoat; following suit with a set of keys. The cigarette, then, is plucked from between his lips; ashed on the ground.  In passing, he flashes an ironic 'peace' sign -- index and middle fingers extended -- in Connelly's direction.  Connelly stands up as she sees the two people coming in...and blinks.."What the..." She says her words hanging in the air as she sees the women with the rifle come into the main hall....  Abel goes still when he see's Penny. "What in the One's name?"  Penny doesn't stop amid the protests but keeps moving for the doors over there. It's not a rifle. It's a gun. A Colt .45 in Penny's hand.  She isn't aiming it at anyone in particular but has it in her right hand. Her grip loosens and blows past Connelly, past Abel She says, in Enochian, "It's nothing to you. Stay out of my way."  -- and Hiro remains just a few feet behind her, keeping pace. His record bag creaks and jangles with his movement, the heavy load thumping against his back.  Connelly does what anyone who has seen armed people moving like that would do...she drops the book she was hold(a Medical Examiners procedural book) and presses her back against the wall.....  Abel calls out, trying to warn the people in the other room.... Abel shouts, "Incoming!"  You open the double doors, heading into the Main Hall beyond. Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber          This room is mostly empty, even more vast in some ways than the hall outside. Only three things mar its granite perfection; an immense marble table at the head of the room with nine chairs, each marked with a single Sphere glyph, an intricately inscribed Certamen circle in the center of the room, and perhaps forty seats at the back of the room, for observers and audience. A single door to the left glows a soft gold.         The great marble table seems to be carved from a single piece of stone. Polished and pristine, the table stands as if it had stood here for an eternity, its circle unbroken and complete. Each seat surrounding it is spaced evenly, as if meticulous care has been given toward seeking this state of equality.         The room is lit by a multitude of dim fires which rest in recessed pits along the walls. Here and there, candelabras stand, adding additional light to the chamber through their infinitely burning candles.                            >                           Contents: Alex Niko Supplies Obvious exits: Left Door    Out      Hiro enters the Council Chambers from the Main Hall outside. Hiro has arrived. Niko read your description.  Alex is seated in the Seat of Correspondence, slightly slouched, and with his fingers folded together in his lap.   Niko walks across the line and enters The Certamen Circle.  Penny-with-the-gun comes through the doors to the chamber, glassy-eyed and radiating that kind of level-headed calm people with guns tend to have. It is not raised or aimed at anyone in particular, it rests there in her right hand.  An extension.  She looks left, looks right and then begins to move at a reduced clip into the room "Where is it." Her voice is a thin, hard line.  Abel enters the Council Chambers from the Main Hall outside. Abel has arrived.  Behind Penny, Hiro pauses at the chamber's threshold; standing in the shadow of the enormous oaken door. He says nothing: expression carefully neutral, only his eyes -- fixed nervously on Penny, lacking their usual narcotic placidity -- giving his state away. The cigarette rises to his lips, cherry flaring bright orange-red.  Abel comes running into the room a moment after Hiro and Penny.  "Where is what?..."Alex queries calmly with a raised eyebrow.  "The body. THE BODY," when she repeats the words, they carry upward. They echo. They reverberate and shuttle quickly back into the void. Still not pointing the gun, Penny watches Niko moves deliberately into the circle. Perhaps it's an involuntary reflex that moves her to say "I don't want to fight you, I just came for the body."  Alex hrms softly and gives a single nod,"...And what do you intend to do with the body?...  Niko settles into the circle, cross-legged and looks to Penny, "This is just where I think...chill out.."  Abel stays back for now... not wanting to get shot.  "They're fucking you about," Hiro murmurs, matter-of-factly. He still shadows the doorway; eyes flicking sideways to Abel as he materializes beside him, then back to Penny, to Alex. "Cough it up, man. He doesn't belong here."  "Oh... And I am sure that you know better than anyone else where the body belongs,"Alex comments casually,"...So why do not you enlighten us with your brillance?..."  Penny fingers the trigger of the gun. Tilting her head to the side, like maybe  she doesn't understand english, Penny squints at Alex. She holds this pose for  one, maybe two minutes before turning and walking back out of the chamber.  "Keene was right."  "...you think they ate him?" Hiro asks, quietly, as Penny draws near. Did he just insinuate... A sideways look at Alex -- a silent stare held for several seconds -- and he turns to follow Penny out.  Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Contents: Connelly Obvious exits: Out to Fields O  Laboratory Doors RD Library Doors LD  Council Chambers FD    Penny returns almost as quickly as she left this area "Where is it, where's the body. You /tell/ me where the body is right now." The gun is still in her hand and she seems less stable, less patient than when she left.  Hiro arrives from the forward doors. Hiro has arrived.  "Yes, the body." Connelly ums.."Who's body?"  Alex arrives from the forward doors. Alex has arrived.  Abel arrives from the forward doors. Abel has arrived. Abel follows Alex out of the room.  Alex casually wanders into the main chamber, stopping just through the door. His head doesn't turn, but one would assume that his eyes are moving about behind the shades.  Hiro doesn't travel far into the corridor. While Penny is interrogating Connelly, Pig-boy is fitting the foam ear-beads of a minidisc player into his ears; thumb held down on the fast-forward button.  Connelly 's stqanding, like she is waiting on something...she is definately watching the gun in Penny's hand..    Hiro says "Need awareness, diff 8, from you guys" //.etro: Connelly rolls "perception + awareness" at diff 8          For a total of 1 success(es). Huh?  (Type "help" for help.) //.etro: Alex rolls "awareness + per" at diff 8          For a total of 1 success(es). You paged Cassius with 'True ..and the last time I did it was with a cabal  member that had matter 2. Rats.'. //.etro: Penny rolls "awareness+perception" at diff 8          For a total of 2 success(es). //.etro: Abel rolls "6" at diff 8          For a total of 2 success(es).  Hiro pages Abel, Penny, Alex, and Connelly: The air is atingle. -_-  Dropping the minidisc player into his labcoat's breast pocket, Hiro takes a hesitant step across the corridor. Then another, and another. "Penny," he says, quietly; as if ignoring the presence of the other mages. "Come on then." A few more steps down the corridor, and he's pushing open the door to the laboratory.  Abel turns to Alex questioningly.  Penny falls back a step from Connelly. If looks could kill. If they could even maim. If she really wanted it to. But Penny just doesn't have time for stupidity. Clearly there are other doors, other venues to pursue here. She looks toward Hiro and gestures with the gun She says, in Enochian, "They have nothing in them but fear. If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man was ever injured,"  spitting to the ground She says, in Enochian, "But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance."  Alex sighs and shakes his head following after Hiro.  Hiro opens and moves through the door marked 'Laboratory.' Hiro has left. You head to the doors marked 'Laboratory' and head through into the room  beyond. Novus Valnastium -- Workspace          This room is bare, save the inclusion of several seats, benches, tables, and other miscellaneous lab equipment. Even with this equipment, the room itself is fairly empty, left to made into whatever is needed at the time. As a lab, it seems poorly equipped; however, should one consider the makeup of the room, it would become clear that the lab was built as such to better align it with any who might use it, as opposed to fitting it to any specific paradigm.  Contents: Hiro Obvious exits: Out     Alex enters the Laboratory from the Main Hall. Alex has arrived.  Abel enters the Laboratory from the Main Hall. Abel has arrived.  In the corner of the room, where Alex's computer system has been setup, is his gang. They appear to be working on something on one of the computers, but when people enter the lab they look up. The sight of Penny's gun has them all on their feet in an instance. However, they take no action, but probably only because Alex holds a hand up to stop them as he enters the lab.  Hiro pushes his way into the library, the tinny rattle from his earbeads growing cacophanous, almost deafening. The Misfits? He fixes his attention on the body lain out on it's gurney; tapping his breast pocket to kill the music. Somehow, he never even looks at the gang of bikers. "Your show, Pence," is all he has to say, unshouldering his record bag, and dropping it down onto a workbench.  You paged Cassius with 'Can I roll at you and can you tell me what the result of a matter scan of the body reveals?'. Cassius pages: Are you looking for something in particular? From afar, Cassius warns he will be logging momentarily. Long distance to Cassius: Penny wants to know if it's booby-trapped or if it's just flesh and bone we're dealing with here. Cally wasn't exactly forthcoming with info. In order to perform this ritual in nine days we're going to have to prepare the body and I don't want any surprises. Cassius pages: Aside from a small implant that looks inactive, the corpse is an ordinary embalmed corpse.  One hand occupied with the gun. The other hand begins pulling things from her bag, that bottomless bag. She begins to deposit these things one after another onto the sheet that covers the body. A sewing kit from The Holiday Inn, her  cellphone, a swiss army knife, a Stickies notepad. "Sharp, Piggy." She holds out her free hand to him but not her full attention. That, the audience will notice, is fixed quite specifically on the head.  Contents of the record bag. white-jacketed records, unlabelled. Black plastic garbage bags. Zip ties. Cylinder of minidiscs. Wire cutters. Bag of cocaine-- that's what he was looking for. He's already got a largish quantity tapped out, narowed down to a three inch long, pencil lead-thin line. It goes up his nose with the hollow cylinder of a mechanical pencil.  "That's some spicy guacamole," he declares, straightening bolt-upright. Sharp sniff. He turns; tosses a sharpie to Penny, underhand.  Alex frowns as he makes his way to a stool next to one of the workbenches. The gang watches with idle curiousity.    Penny says "Awareness rolls diff 8, please." //.etro: Hiro rolls "perception+awareness" at diff 8          For a total of 0 success(es). //.etro: Abel rolls "7" at diff 8          For a total of 1 success(es). Long distance to Hiro: Penny just got ammo. Alex frowns as he makes his way to a stool next to one of the workbenches. The  gang watches with idle curiousity. //.etro: Alex rolls "awareness + per" at diff 8          For a total of 2 success(es).  You paged (blind) Alex and Abel with 'Huge energy centered around Penny as she makes a move toward the head.'.  Alex sits on the stool, leaning an elbow on the workbench. His head tilts slightly as Penny moves toward the head, but he doesn't do anything to stop her.  Abel says, "Penny, what are you doing?"  Hiro cuts out a second line with the edge of a public library card. He seals the bag, dropping it into a labcoat pocket, and leans forward. "And one for my dead homie," he murmurs, before huffing the entirety up his left nostril.  Penny has the ability to do two or more things at once. She catches the marker and moves the sheet at the same time, uncovering the lump that was Chase's head. "Son of a bitch," she remarks, her hands turning the appendage, eyes wide ..maybe more dilated than they should be "son of a /bitch/. You fucking assholes," a remark for the group. "Knife, Piggy."  Penny says it again, insistant "Piggy, KNIFE."  How is it that people consuming cocaine, irregardless of other tendencies and paraphenalia choices, always seem to carry a bladed weapon? Who would have guessed that Hiro kept a gleaming, polished kitchen knife -- wicked looking bugger, fine swedish craftmanship -- in his record bag? He brandishes it briefly, turns it in his hand to grip it by the back of the blade, and offers it to Penny handle-first.  "Don't gotta be a howling cunt about it," he replies. Sniff.  Abel seems very unsure about what's going on, like he wants to interfere, but he doesn't, though he makes a few moves to.  Alex tilts his head little in Abel's direction without looking away from what Penny is doing. "Maybe she is trying to get inside Chase's head?..."  Penny responds with a quick "You don't know what I'm looking at," to justify the howling. Looking back over her shoulder at the gang of geeks Penny advises "You might want to step back," bending over the head she rests the knife on the gurney's edge "You, too" kind of waggling the gun toward the door at Alex and Abel implying that 'step back' means 'leave.'  Appearantly Alex isn't about to leave. He remains seated on the stool, elbow leaning on the workbench. He seems totally unfazed by what Penny is doing or is planning on doing.  "Motherfucker looks like he could use one," Hiro comments, sniffing again. He does not step back; he leans forward to stare glassy-eyed at the gap between head and neck. "Fuck. They really did him, didn't they?"  Abel looks at Alex and back at Penny. He hesitates but doesn't leave either. He stays back and out of the way though.  "Yeah they did," she asides to Hiro, her voice quiet and contained, possessed of the strangest calm. "Suit yourself, just don't blame me .." Already embalmed there's no gore, no blood when Penny slides the knife through the remaining tissue at the base of the skull. Carefully she presses until she can 'see' with the knife what she was looking for. Retracting the knife slowly, something not flesh and not bone begins to issue forth.  An implant of some kind.  "Careful with that,"Alex advices as Penny takes out the implant.  Abel frowns. "Are those Chases or did someone else put them there?" He looks a little sick.  Penny palms and pockets the implants, ah-ah-ahing at Alex with the gun "Back off. The Invisible College is the executor of Chase Kettle's last will and testament. If you can't respect the wishes of a dead man," letting it hang unsaid what she would hate to have to do.  "Piggy you maybe bring those bay leaves?" Never taking her eyes off Alex, her communication with Hiro is succinct and to the point.  "Show me the will,"Alex says pointedly as he stands slowly,"Because otherwise I am going to assume that you are mutalating and stealing from the dead....."  "Besides..."Alex adds,"You can not do much with those implants without special skills...."  "Fuckin' black box," mumbles Hiro, retreating to the workbench. He tears a garbage bag free from the roll, tucking it under his arm. A manilla envelope follows, embossed with six seperate post marks; a wide array of postagestamps. Mostly european, by the look of them. He passes it off to Penny, shooting a look back over his shoulder to Alex. "Don't fuck about with the affairs of collegates, for they are blatant and very fucking high on drugs," he advises.  Gandalf would not exactly be proud.  Abel shakes his head but remains back. He doesn't know anything about this techno stuff anyway.  "Well, if you want to see what happened when Chase was killed, I have it on DVD," Alex states with a bit of a smirk. He then turns to face Hiro,"Be careful who you say shit like that to," he says reaching up to remove his shades. As he does so, his right eye and the curcuitry tattoos flash a bright blue.  You say, "See boyo? Special skills," indicating for Hiro with a half-nod she tosses the envelope lefty at Alex. There other important things to concentrate on. Dickwaving never did hold her interest. She looks at Hiro again. Well, maybe. But other important things - like how to pick up the head with a gun in her hand. "Little help here, hey?"  Alex frowns slightly as he catches the envelope. Opening it he checks inside.  "I ain't threatening anyone, man. 'm just here for m'fuckin friend."  Shaking the black garbage bag out, Hiro stuffs his arm down inside, gripping Chase's severed head through the plastic. He turns the bag inside out around it; twisting it around several times, reverse double-bagging, and fixing the top with a knot. "Let's go, Penny. We can get the body later."  Abel sighs a bit and heads out of the room. He isn't doing any good in here anyway.  Alex takes a smaller envelope out of the envelope and proceeds to open that one.  Pig Boy (Saturday) says, "You paged Alex with 'It's full of crushed bay leaves.'."  Alex pours out the content of the envelope on the floor, leaves of some kind, and then tosses away the envelope. He seems about to say something, but when Hiro speaks he just shrugs instead.  Abel leaves by way of the double doors, entering the Main Hall. Abel has left.  Penny picks up her cellphone, presses two buttons and starts texting something with one hand, murmuring "Please don't let anyone move his body," gesturing around the lab with the gun "this place is just fine." Eerie, this disaffected notion in her voice. So brisk, so formal all this time. She looks up at Hiro and collects her personal effects. "Alright. I'm ready."  "You shouldn't litter. Those make excellent seasoning," Hiro says, stuffing the bagged head into his record bag, and repacking the remainder of the contents. The strap goes over his shoulder, and he gives Penny a curt nod.  "When he tells us, we'll let you know," he informs Alex, brushing past.  Abel leaves the hall, headed back to the Earth. Abel opens the two double doors leading out to the plains, leaving to enter the plains beyond. Abel has left.  Connelly looks at the people coming out of the lab...and keeps back from the door...  Hiro steps out of the laboratory ahead of Penny. His record bag bulges oddly. Another flashed 'peace' at Connelly, and he heads for the exit.  Penny follows Hiro at the same pace, her gun holstered. "Y'think he'll maybe share a cab with us?" nodding up ahead at the doors. "Fuck if I've even got change for the bus.."  Alex enters the Hall from the Laboratory. Alex has arrived.  Alex steps out of the lab, when he sees Penny and Hiro still in the main chamber he stops. Doesn't do any. Doesn't say a word. Just watches them.  "No bus," Hiro mumbles around the filter of his fresh cigarette, butane flaring between his cupped palms. His tread is the confident, heavy steps of the incredibly coked up. "We walk him home." And exeunt.

       You return IC ... You open the double doors and head out into the open, rolling fields beyond. Rolling Fields          It's a gorgeous sight, the brilliant yellows and greens of freshly sprouted grasses waving in the wind, rolling hills stretching off as far as the eye can see. Pure, golden sunlight pours forth from the never-setting sun standing at twelve o'clock high, bringing a mild, pleasant warmth to the vast expanse of land. Puffy white clouds dart through the sky, sometimes fast, sometimes languid and slow, always casting their cool shadows across the land.         As you reach the peak of one of the highest hills, you are able to survey the land as the scent of new life washes over you. Facing north, toward the keep, a massive forest sits, far off into the distance to the west. Several deer can be seen darting into the trees as you spot them, as if sensing your discerning eye. Immediately opposite it is a large body of water, from which a small stream flows. Near the stream is a large oaken forest, which gradually renews itself in the warm light. Before you, directly opposite the massive crater, there rests Novus Valnastium, a large stone complex resting atop another hill, with one lone tower stretching into the sky above.         A little off to the northeast, a small and upside-down, metallic-bowl structure sits. Long tethers are coiled up beside the structure; no more does the glorious airship dock above it. The slender curves and high-tech metals used on the small building are a stark contrast to the Keep, merely fifty yards away, and it easily gives away who is responsible for such a building.                                   >                                   Contents: Shen Chi Cole Cadence Viktor Obvious exits:   _________________________  //.etro: Toronto by Night _________________________ Name          Sex Mode    Idle  Type  Short Description ______________________________________________________________________________  Cadence        F   IC      1m   Pl    - Viktor         M   IC      3m   Pl    - Penny          F   IC      1s   Pl    Chute jacket, jeans, t-shirt.

If you had asked me yet a week before, I might ask you to be formal, but fate has decided that I shouldn't.... Anyways, thats not important nor likely interesting to you two." He looks and addresses only Shen and Cole. "Welcome, I suppose. I'm not sure why Cadence has brought you here, but I'm sure it was with good reason."  Cole jams his hands in the kangaroo pocket of his ragged burgundy sweatshirt, watching Cadence, Shen Chi, and Viktor talk.  Shen Chi raises his brow rather interestedly at what Viktor has to say. The ball bounces from behind his shoulder and heads toward Cadence' hand without Shen Chi even look. "Cady? Well, Kaze brought me here the first time I came. I suppose Cady is only being curteous." He grins in her direction once more without quite looking at her before he says. "I find a lot of things interesting, by the way. But only so many interesting things can be said at one time, I suppose."  Cadence responds to Viktor, "I didn't bring Shen Chi here. If you hadn't noticed, he walked in quite well on his own." She almost misses the ball tossed to her, thinking that he wasn't going to throw it, and already having taken her hand back. She manages to fumble through catching it, however, just barely. With a small smile she looks over toward Cole, tossing it to him. "So what brings you by?" she addresses Shen Chi for the last question.  Penny makes great strides towards the crater's edge, bee-lining from the novus in a hurry and a half. Along the way she caps a pen, yanks out a hat from her bag and winds a scarf around her neck.  Viktor glances at Penny and listens for Shen Chi's answer.  Cole glances over at the swiftly moving Penny as well, watching her curiously.  Shen Chi shifts his hand into his pocket and removes another nearly fuzzless tennis ball and shrugs casually. "I was looking for Kaze. He's not with Ryo so I thought he might be here. I'm worried about... Well, it doesn't matter, I can talk to Kaze about it." He smiles amiably and offers his free hand to Viktor. "It is good to meet you, Mr. Deseann." He glances sidelong at Penny for a moment before smiling upon Viktor again. "Do you live here?"  Viktor takes his hand and replies, "I don't live anywhere. I no longer have a house to stay in." He doesn't seem disturbed or worried about this in the least.  Cadence looks surprised at that news, looking away from the swift Penny back to Viktor. "You don't? You can't stay at the estate?"  As Cole is distracted by Penny's dash, he misses the ball entirely and it bonks him in the side of the head. He looks first to Shen Chi curiously, wondering how he managed to get a ball to hit the ~other~ side of his head...when it dawns on him. He looks back at Cadence, shocked, before bending to pick up the ball and coming up red-eared.    Industrial Light and Sound says "Any'f you seen the flyers that just hit the streets? Just got one from some kid outside the saigon."   Patch'em'Up shrugs. "I think you got too much time on your hand, dude   The Forger says "what are they spreading around now?"  Viktor sighs and says, "Staying and living are two different things. I /could/ stay there, but I don't feel welcome if I make it my home for more than a few nights. Besides, it's not my home. It won't ever be."  ============================ BB Post in Progress ============================= Group:  Mage - Traditions Title:  On Mourning: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Around 9:30pm, March 24 the following URL is posted.          http://www.junkho.org/  and written in copperplate beneath:          AD NOCENDUM POTENTES SUMUS    ==============================================================================  Cadence winces as she turns back just in time to see Cole picking up the ball. She smiles sheepishly, though there's a healthy dose of amusement in the expression as well. "Ooops," she mutters, then explains to Cole, "You were supposed to -catch- it. I thought you were looking. Sorry." She holds out a hand to him to toss the ball back again. "What happened to your previous home?"  Shen Chi seems to miss this interplay and just watches Viktor, tilting his head curiously. "I could talk to some people in low income housing and help you find an apartment, Mr. Deseann. How much money do you make? A roof over one's head does wonders for the Self."  Street> Industrial Light and Sound says "Here, check't out. (http://www.junkho.org/) Creepy shit for a party, man."  Cole tosses the ball back to Cadence and returns his wavering attention to the matter at hand, housing. Clearly a weighty issue. He nods to Viktor, seconding Shen Chi's offer and encouragement.  Viktor gives Cadence a rather mean look for seemingly no reason and says, "If I have to explain to you whats happened to me recently, then you obviously didn't care enough to listen before... meaning I doubt you do now. As for your offer, I must decline. A librarians salary is hardly enough to cover much buy my eating, and I prefer to sleep here more often than not, mostly because I won't be bothered."  Cole glances over at Shen Chi...  Shen Chi nods solemnly to Viktor, as if he certainly has all the freedom in the world to make that choice. However, he does clarify. "Low income housing is intended for people with low incomes, but it is okay. I am sure living here is just fine." He smiles in a friendly manner upon Viktor before shifting his gaze to Cole and Cadence, "Just showing Cole around? He needs his hand held?"  A shadow of a shadow, Penny's form diminshes. Moving toward the vanishing point between the tall grasses and the crater's edge, not even her path remains - swaying reeds that part and bend so easily snap back to their own form.   You walk south along Parliament to Queens Quay. Waterfront - Parliament and Queens Quay(#1111RJ)       The intersection here is a patchwork of overpasses and onramps that join the city streets, with the Gardiner Expressway stretching east and west, and the Don Valley Parkway heading north through the city. The expressway is literally a dividing line between the downtown core and the waterfront, and below it, the development of the city center gives way to a mix of run down warehouses, seedy industrial infrastructure, and commercial docks further south. While one can make out the Toronto Star building lit up to the West, and the soaring height and sparkling lights of the CN Tower in the midst of the skyline beyond, this part of Toronto is clearly far removed from all of that. This area is dirtier than the city center, and graffiti marks the support structures of the overpass and is scrawled on some of the warehouse walls, colorful gang tags dimly visible. After dark, with most of the actual businesses closed, that same criminal element tends to wander a bit more visibly, making this a dangerous part of the city indeed, its grimier side not easily hidden by the rows of trees and other foliage planted along the waterfront, the most recent attempt at urban renewal just coming into bloom.   It's fair and mild, with a few clouds in the sky.  Obvious exits:  Warehouse WA       It is larger than most warehouses on the block. Standing tall and preeminent in its domain you are faced with clerestory windows and a set of large doors. They are opened only for for tractor trailers and large panel vans to load and unload their shipping. There is a side door which allows for individual traffic without all the effort required to open the much larger sliding doors.   Hiro has arrived.  Everyone has a distinctive walk, a particular kind of footstep. She knows it's you before you say anything. "Should check it for bugs," Penny comments in an offhand, distracted way "can never be too careful." Hands on her hips, some flyers folded under her arm, she looks up, scanning the line of the rooftop. "Get tight on the door, yeah? Otherwise this is gonna be a bitch. Last thing we need is another lysergic puke fest."  "Nobody's botherin' to bug these shitholes," answers Hiro, coming to a stop just behind your left shoulder. He hits his cigarette, the precognitive emphysemic wheeze of smoke sucked through a filter. "We do a map point block and a half away, use one of the kids -- bring them in a few at a time. No big groups."  Penny reaches over, ashes the cigarette - her hand on yours - and takes it to the corner of her mouth. Dragging long, she exhales with a rattling cough "Should get a screen up in there so they can't see .." pausing to look up the block "..everything."  Another immense pause. Everything behind the curtain. "Wonder if Alex'll show," testing the boundary of a smile, fasting made her lips chapped and raw. "Kinda beats you got lined up?"  "We open with dawn and some fluff-cheese. Some kinda uplifting bullshit." Hiro rolls a shoulder, giving a tug to the lapel of his technicolor dream coat. "Mix in some Klute, go right for the hard dee'n'bee. Maybe psy when things wind down and everybody's fuckered to the gills..." He trails off, squinting up at the warehouse's high windows; mouthing something wordless to himself. Numbers.  "You're gonna be gone, too" examining the cigarette, it's filter, like she's never smoked before. She tosses it into a drainage grate "Better get the monkey on board to take over when it starts to hit."  "I'm gonna go get the.. get things started." They say you should never do anything you can not admit to later. But some things. Some things are unutterable.  "I'm eating a ten-strip tonight," Hiro answers absently, tilting a sidelong look towards Penny as she turns away. "I do my best work fuckered to the gills." A killing drag from his cigarette, flicked aside -- an end-on-end red-orange parabola in the dark, then *hsst* into a pool of filthy water -- and he turns away as well, heading down the street.   [MEANWHILE… 8 hours later…]  Waterfront - Parliament and Queens Quay(#1111RJ)       The intersection here is a patchwork of overpasses and onramps that join the city streets, with the Gardiner Expressway stretching east and west, and the Don Valley Parkway heading north through the city. The expressway is literally a dividing line between the downtown core and the waterfront, and below it, the development of the city center gives way to a mix of run down warehouses, seedy industrial infrastructure, and commercial docks further south. While one can make out the Toronto Star building lit up to the West, and the soaring height and sparkling lights of the CN Tower in the midst of the skyline beyond, this part of Toronto is clearly far removed from all of that. This area is dirtier than the city center, and graffiti marks the support structures of the overpass and is scrawled on some of the warehouse walls, colorful gang tags dimly visible. After dark, with most of the actual businesses closed, that same criminal element tends to wander a bit more visibly, making this a dangerous part of the city indeed, its grimier side not easily hidden by the rows of trees and other foliage planted along the waterfront, the most recent attempt at urban renewal just coming into bloom.   It's fair and mild, with a few clouds in the sky.  Obvious exits:   You return IC ... You open the warehouse door and walk in off the street. Main Floor - Warehouse(#1811RIXJM)       On a normal evening, the warehouse would be nothing more than a giant, empty metal cavern. Tonight, however, it's been transformed into a technicolor, sensual version of Heaven and Hell. The corrugated metal walls and ceiling have been painted - half the room in black, and half the room in white - separated from each other with only a sheer veil of gauzy scarves and sparkling beads that dangle from the rafters. Music throbs throughout at a volume that's nearly deafening.      In order to get to Heaven, one must first go through Hell. The black portion of the warehouse is dark and forbidding. Black-stemmed electric candles with red flickering bulbs are mounted on the walls, illuminating a scattering of second-hand sofas where the weary may find respite. Two large television screens hang from high, blasting images of dancing concert crowds interspersed with scenes of destruction, fire, death and mayhem. Three black, corinthian columns rise from the floor to the endless blackness above, while the fourth column lays on its side. The floor is littered with sparkling silver dust and black feathers from Fallen angels.      Heaven is nearly a mirror image of Hell. Ivory-stemmed electric candles featuring white lights cast a warm, steady glow around the perimeter where a collection of comfortable sofas and chairs can be found. Two large television screens hang from high on the walls, scenes of televangelists and religious congregations flickering between images of nude bodies entwined in rhythmic coupling. Four pearly, corinthian columns rest majestically, one in each corner, and the floor is covered with gold dust and the white feathers of Heaven's chosen.                  **   *   **  Contents: Taliesin Alexandre Daisy Standingwater Niko Abel Hiro Obvious exits:    Taliesin smiles to Abel, "That's wonderful." He winks, "I was hoping you would do something like that when faced with her being sent away. She'll be in good hands, and I'm sure we'll be able to arrange for you to visit." He looks around, "As for the party. I'll miss the guy, I really will."  Hiro snaps the top of the sound console down, checks the power, and begins to switch the remainder of his equipment on. There's a lot more there than just the turntables and mixer -- small black boxes with small knobs and softly glowing LCD screens. "Five till takeoff, Daisy," he announces, examining his watch again.  Alexandre nods slightly to Standingwater, "It seems a lot of us are waiting for that." Frowns slightly, then looks to Niko, then back to Standingwater, "A lot of things were put on hold, I suppose."  Abel says, "We're only engaged... I don't have a place to live yet... or a job that will pay enough... but... but The One willing IFYA will happen and then I'll have a bit more of something to offer her."  Viktor opens the door and enters from the streetside. Viktor has arrived.  Niko glances over to Alexandre, 'I'm ready to do it now if you folks are..'  Viktor enters and says, "Ah ha! There they are." He appears to have just arrived from scanning all the warehouses.  Jake has arrived.  Alexandre looks over to Niko, shakes his head, "Not right now. Later this week? I don't have all my instruments with me."  Abel's slightly hazed look scans the room as he turns toward Niko, pausing at one moment to look into empty space, then continuing on to Niko, Jamaia, and Alexandre. "Are you heading toward Michigan? he asks?"  Standingwater just grunts, pulls his hat back down, and settles more comfortably against the wall.  Standingwater grunts from under his hat, "Michigan. Hell. It doesn't matter. I'll go."  The entity that has come to pay its respect to the late Chase Kettle moves about the room again, leaving the slumbering Maisri to her foggy dreams.  Alexandre looks to Abel, somewhat surprised by the question, "Mmm... No. I'm not sure to what you're referring." He smiles slightly as Viktor walks in, raising his hand to greet him.  Jake walks in quietly.  Penny, obviously, is bringing in the tv.  There's a big commotion at the doors, see; jostling and shouting. Pushing a television stand on wheels through a small army of ravers is a difficult thing. They kind of back up, their arms spreading back and outward, giving Penny plenty of room.  The tv itself is something decades old. Straight out of the eighties. There's a crack running down the center of the glass. Or maybe it's a pattern? It doesn't have the look of a natural smash. Snaking out between her steps is the tail of large, orange extension cord.  "Oi," she shouts.  Daisy stands from her sand-painting and carefully edges her way around it, expression neutral, to take a place in front of the microphone.  For those that haven't seen her in the past two weeks, her condition -- already questionable -- continues to deteriorate. Heavy bags hang underneath her dishwater-coloured eyes; her skin hangs like rags over bones. Catabolism has eaten her down to her core.  "Hi," she says uncertainly, wincing at the sound of her amplified voice. "The Invisible College would like to welcome you to the Invisible Party. You all know ... you all know why you're here."  Abel turns to Daisy as she makes her announcement. He nods.  Viktor nudges aside someone to get a good look has an expression like he /doesn't/ know why hes there.  Hiro steps aside to make room for Daisy, his thumb held down on a cut-out button on his console. The kids near the front of the venue are getting to their feet, dusting gold-dust from their gargantuan pants. His expression is, perhaps, less neutral - more on the side of grm.  Alexandre shifts where he stands, looking towards Daisy as she speaks. He adjusts his satchel so that it hangs mostly over his back. Hiro drops SETUP: READ ME!.  This area is temporarially a DAYZONE. The party is taking place starting at IC dawn. Those of you with broadband and winamp can tune in:                 http://205.188.234.65:8024 Almost anyone can view the flyers:                 http://www.junkho.org  "You're here," Daisy continues, "because Chase Kettle is dead. He died ... well, he died to save the Invisible College from monsters we don't quite understand. But. I mean. There --"  -- and she nearly falls over, tendons standing out against pale skin as she grips the microphone --  "-- I mean, I'm sorry. We, and I mean by that Penny and me, we've been fasting waiting for this. So all of you pull up a beer. There's gonna be a show, and then some dancing. Listen, though: we respect your religions. Just this once, respect ours."  Taliesin makes his way over to Penny pushing through the crowd, although they clear out of his way fairly helpfully. He mutters to Penny, "... do... want... place... honour?"  He smiles slightly as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out what appears to be a black silk handkerchief, which he begins unfolding slowly, while waiting for Penny's response to his question.  You sense Taliesin makes his way over to Penny pushing through the crowd, although they clear out of his way fairly helpfully. "Where do you want me to place the guest of honour?" He smiles slightly as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out what appears to be a black silk handkerchief, which he begins unfolding slowly, while waiting for Penny's response to his question.  Jake waits quietly.  ...the kids, the crew that's been hanging around, is already clustering around the pair of pony kegs; someone brought plastic cups. Strangely, they each take only an inch of beer or so; about a fifth of a cup each. They cluster around of the edges of the warehouse with their cups, silent.  Abel looks concernedly up at Daisy and starts to move toward her when he sees her stumble, but she seems to be OK... well... sorta.  Through the glitter and feathers, Penny shoves the stand on squeaky wheels finally to where it belongs. She wheels the stand around so that the screen faces the crowd. Then she starts undressing, walking towards Hiro, scarf, mittens, jacket, hat. These things are discarded as Taliesin follows in their wake. She slows down, pausing while she unbuckles her belt and kicks off her shoes, "Follow me," and leads Tal behind the curtain.  With a wan smile to Abel, Daisy adds, "We're okay," and turns around to take the television's plug, to run it toward the wall, to plug it in. This all takes much longer than it might otherwise: the cord jumps and twists in her impaired perception, remaining steady only at the margins of her peripheral vision.  The handerchief now looks like a flag as Taliesin continues unfolding it even as he walks behind Penny, the thing hanging by one hand to his gleaming oaken staff. Is there an end to the thing? No one will know because he's slipped behind the curtain after Penny.  Abel nods to Daisy. "If you need me let me know." He looks over at the Pony kegs then. A small look of fear passes though his grey eyes, pretty easy to see it too sinc ehtey have that partially stoned, distant seeing look.  Penny draws and ties the curtain onto a pole. It seems to be one of those unwritten rules of the party - you don't go near the decks, you do not pass go. A small group of glitter-tykes reassemble in the area, filling in the holes Penny, Tal and Daisy left in the crowd.  Hiro bends down to retrieve a record from the plastic milk crate behind the decks, examing the label, flipping it over, and sliding it onto the spindle of the leftmost table. He cranks the volume all the way down -- a barely perceptible thrum, somewhere at the edge of perception -- and lays the needle down. No music yet.  Abel heads over to Hiro and leans into whisper to him, the slightly hesitant look still in his eyes.  As Hiro lays the needle down, the television springs to life. The screen casts Heaven and Hell in a cool blue glow for a long moment. Phantom shapes play across the split in the screen, glowing in shades of green and red and blue.  Daisy takes the microphone again, murmuring, "Take seats, if you want. There're couches around the edges of the room. This will take a while, but I'm sure you'll want to see it."  With a hesitant look around the room -- she's still not used to taking the job of MC -- she steps back.  [BEHIND THE CURTAIN] It seems to be an altar, the overturned area of squatted living - a bathtub smashed into pieces, a sink and mirror equally shattered. "Here," continuing to remove her clothing, she walks into an unlit area where the light can't find her skin "put him here. And his blood, if you have it."  A rustling then. Of loose fabric. She reappears, tying on a sheet. Horribly emaciated, a lone survivor of some civil unrest. "Okay?"  Taliesin finishes unfolding the black silk cloth to its full dimensions eight feet across and six feet wide. He sets it down over the bathtub as directed. He shakes his head, "No blood I'm afraid. Whomever embalmed him either did it with magic or got rid of it." He sets down his staff for a moment and spreads the cloth out a bit over something, a form that was certainly not anything in the bathtub. He looks at it for a moment, concentrates and then, with an almost theatrical gesture, grabs one end of the black cloth and yanks, flinging it off of the headless corpse of one Chase Kettle, Esq.  [OUT THERE IN THE WAREHOUSE] Alexandre remains in the back, then makes his way towards the front. He accepts a plastic cup that's passed to him, peers at its contents. Sniffs it. Wrinkles his nose, then steps back slightly from the ravers. His left hand, with the cup, drops to his side as he waits.  One of the kids leaves the crowd; approaching Hiro as he slips a pair of headphones around his neck. Pig-boy leans forward to accept a plastic cup -- half-full of beer -- with two hands; giving Abel a sidelong look. "Don't sweat it, Abel. Just watch." He thumbs the microphone off, and turns to face the television.  Jake does not sit, he mearly remains standing and watches everything in a quiet manner.  Abel nods, looking a bit relieved. "Thanks Hiro. Maybe I'll explain someday." Then he moves away to get a view of the TV.  Abel looks back over. "I'll pray if it will help, though.  Penny unhooks the curtain allowing Tal to leave. She stands there a moment, looking over her shoulder. "It'll do." She hangs back and waits a moment, watching the blue light start to flicker across the crowd.  Alexandre read your description. Penny(#6870PIOAC)  The refined sythesis of hard living and regular controlled substance abuse is as much a draw as it is obvious; this woman is tall and lean in a way that exaggerates her features. The countenance is the portrait of the soul and the eyes mark its intentions. Summed up in a word; pin-points. Green eyes, dyed-black eyebrows obvious on the paler skin. Her mouth a red, ripe stain; a suggestion of violence in the curve of her lips.  She's got white hair, a canvas for other color. With a part on the extreme left, it was cut with a blunt tool and layered across. If you could stand above her, it's shaped exactly like an almond and drops across one eye.  She has an incredibly pretty face, nothing hidden, no lines of early aging, no mark or scar. An eternity of cheek bones, a long neck and around it one long silver chain vee-ing into the collar of her shirt, something suspended at the end. The lack of sun has turned her pale and she's become translucent where the skin is thinnest, the bluest veins risen to the surface.  She wears white fabric wrapped badly, like a toga. She is skin and bones. This is not the look of a healthy young woman - there's hollowness, spaces waiting to be filled. Around her arms are tattoos in india ink - words and phrases in a language not known to many or at all. Her feet are covered in the same manner.  Daisy stands at the microphone for a moment. She clears her throat. She shuffles her feet. She closes her eyes. When she speaks, her voice is low; her diction is stuttering. She misses words, trips over them, goes back and corrects them.   "Praise be unto thee, O Osiris, the Lord of Eternity," she says. "Un-Nefer, Heru-Khuti, whose forms are manifold, whose attributes are majestic. Praise be unto thee, O thou who art Ptah-Seker-Tem in Anu. Thou Lord of the hidden shrine. Thou Creator of Het-ka-Ptah and of the gods therein, thou Guide of the Tuat, who art glorified when thou settest in the sky."  And the screen lights up.  The film is familiar by now. Jackie Kennedy and the President are driving in Dallas. The book depository is invisible and inevitable. It lurks outside the frame, impatient for history to catch up. The crowd swells and bulges with the anticipation of a spectacle.  The President smiles.  Two hundred saw it. Only Zapruder's grainy film and unsteady camera is preserved. The event is expected. The expectation hangs in the air, and Daisy continues to chant.  Taliesin steps out from behind the curtain. He occupies himself near it by folding up the now huge piece of silk cloth that he's carrying, before shoving back into the crowd. When all is said and done, its a neatly folded handkerchief again and goes into his pocket.  Sound creeps in at the lower edge of perception; a wash of incomprehensible female vocals, the decibel level of a television in the next room. A beat, irregular and surreal, vibrates at a level more felt than heard.  Viktor watches curiously.  The President waves. His expression is opaque; contemplative.  The cantor intones, "Thou turnest thy face towards Amentet. Thou makest the earth to shine as with refined copper. "  And it happens.   Through Zapruder's eyes, the event is silent, sterile. The six immortal frames pass in a moment. There is no hot rush of blood. There is no sound, and out of the frame, Secret Service agents scatter, though Zapruder directs his attention elsewhere; down. It is Jacqueline's face, still uncomprehending, which is the focus of the camera.  "Those who have lain down in death rise up to see thee," whispers Daisy. "They still breathe."  Abel stands where he can see, his eyes still distant looking... you'd say he was stoned if you didn't Abel never gets stoned. His lips move in silent prayer.  Alexandre closes his eyes for a moment, right after the the moment, then opens his eyes to look at the image.  "Isis embraceth thee in peace," murmurs Daisy, voice wavering, on the verge of breaking. "She driveth away the fiends from the entrances of thy paths. She driveth away the fiends from the entrance of your paths."  Jacqueline cradles Jack's head. The tears are immediate, but only a projection: the grain of the film is too strong. They can only be imagined. The scene leaps. The film threatens to tear.   From behind the television, the chorus intones: "Their hearts are at peace since they behold thee, o thou who art Eternity and Everlastingness. Their hearts are at peace since they behold thee, o Osiris.""  The crowd of ravers is silent - immobile. They all hold their cups still; none of them have consumed the small quantity of beer. All eyes are on the television. Walking out from behind the curtain, Penny mouths the words Daisy speaks, the way people familiar with a body of work do. She puts her hands on two people, leaning at first like she might faint. They walk her up onto the dais to stand next to Hiro. Niko read your description. Abel read your description. The film cuts away.  The film is no longer Zapruder's. It's less grainy. More professional. It depicts a dissection table: a heavy surgical light hangs overhead, casting the theatre in sharp-edged shadows. Four surgeons surround a corpse; Kennedy's, you presume.   "The hair of the Osiris Ani," Daisy says, breaking with the liturgy, for those who remember it. Her tone is opaque. "The hair of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, is the hair of Nu."  Without turning his attention away from the television, Hiro lays a hand on Penny's shoulder; gives it a wordless squeeze. The single record continues to spin silently behind him, the tactile bassline going through a subtle shift in tone; from merely trippy, to something more alien - darker.  The doctors begin to cut away the hair on the back of the corpse's head. The slim blade of a scalpel is inserted between scalp and skull; a thin incision is made. The screen has begun to throb; the glass gently pulsates with the shifting glow of the video playing beneath.  "The face of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, is the face of Ra," Daisy says, voice firm.  Acting with wordless coordination, the doctors turn the corpse over. One is staring at something behind the cameraman, just over his shoulder. Another disappears behind the cameraman for a moment. The remaining two begin to make incisions into Kennedy's forehead, near the exit wound. Blood has collected in thick dry cakes in the President's eyes; it spills in runnels over his cheeks.  With delicate precision, the doctors extract the bullet. They operate solemnly, wordlessly. It clinks down hard in a surgical pan.  Peculiarly, there is a wine rack positioned along the back wall, full of bottles. The labels are unreadable.  Abel is engrossed in the video. Watching with the others.. He actually seemed to react when Daisy changes the liturgy. Maybe he knows it as well?  "The eyes of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, are the eyes of Hathor."  One of the doctors opens the corpse's eyes, checks their dilated pupils with a scope. The doctor that had disappeared behind the frame returns, unwinding a length of surgical tubing from around his upper arm. Laughing (and silently; the microphone isn't turned on) he punches another of the surgeons in the arm.  Viktor watches silently, but confused at the purpose of all this. He looks around at all the people near him.  "The ears of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, are the ears of Up-uatu."  The ears are checked for obstructions. The doctor who has just come back from out of frame is weaving; his eyes are bloodshot, unfocused, and his hands tremble. A stroke of his knife removes a section of Kennedy's ear: a thick crescent of flesh that disfigures the organ into unrecognizability.  The crowd seems full of what some present might consider children. Teenagers. Young twenty-somethings. They're dressed for a party, but a solemn mood prevails. More have filed in, while the video was running; perhaps thirty, forty people now. Each holds a single plastic cup, the contents untouched. No pleasant greetings ring out. None of the candy kids hugs each other. There is an aura of familiarity between them -- but not joviality.  Standingwater goes home. Standingwater has left.  "The lips of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, are the lips of Anpu," the chorus intones as one doctor inserts a metal appliance into the President's mouth. The inebriated doctor stands aside as the other attendants wind it open. "The teeth of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, are the teeth of Serqet."  Underneath the surgical masks, one of the doctors is laughing. The joke is lost to history. Undeterred, the cantor continues:  "The cheeks of the Osiris Ani," Daisy says, clinging to the microphone, "whose word is truth, are the cheeks of Isis."  At least not yet there isn't. Penny and Hiro watch Daisy sweat the microphone along with everybody else. There isn't a smiling face in the house, no uncomfortable fidgiting or throat-clearing either. This is not your average group of afterhours kids - they're seasoned professionals.  Abel looks over to see what Tal is doing.  Because we want to wake these ravers up some day and they need to get used to the wierder shit we do ..like summon spirits.  Taliesin is standing there silently, holding his staff in his right hand. He makes no sound, barely breathes in fact, perhaps he's praying, perhaps he's stunned by the moment. It is difficult to read his expression, although there is something soft in his eyes that suggests a bittersweet mix of joy and grief.  Daisy says, "The arms of the Osiris Ani," the cantor says, "whose word is truth, are the arms of Ba-neb-Tetu."  While Daisy speaks, something on the screen is going wrong. The doctors are bringing out a surgical saw. Two of the doctors retreat behind the cameraman; the others bring the to sparking life. The camera cuts out for a moment. The lights flicker. The throbbing becomes a backbeat to Daisy's voice. One. Two. Three. Each beat hits a different word.  They have cut the President's arms off.  If the suspension of disbelief had not been broken yet, it is almost certainly broken now."  Abel turns back to the video, eyes still wide. Jake opens the door and heads out streetside. Jake has left.  Someone breaks off from the crowd, moving to stand a short distance from Daisy. He places his cup next to Daisy, on the platform housing turntables and mixer, and dissapears back from whence he came.  "The thighs of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, are the thighs of Nut."  The doctors weave slowly down the President's body. Briefly, from just out of frame, you can see the nose of an ass, lips pulled back in a terrible idiot grin. The cameraman is disinterested; the viewers therefore get no better view.   Their intention to cut off the President's legs is obvious. The camera mercifully cuts away, but the chorus is unrelenting. "The breast of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, is the breast of the Lady of Sais," Daisy pronounces. "The breast of the Osiris Ani is become the breast of the Lady of Sais."  Abel seems to blanche but then seems glad, maybe he noticed the Ommission?  Viktor yawks and looks away as this starts to get a little sick.  Taliesin, perhaps a bit stronger of constitution, or will, remains watching the ceremony unchanged by the events taking place on the screen.  Abel also keeps watching. He still looks pale, though.  Alexandre's eyes narrow as he watches; he looks towards Daisy, looks towards Penny, gaze shifting between them. The cup in his left hand shifts slightly, he returns to looking at the screen, but he keeps the same suspicious look.  Niko has watched the entire thing without a flinch, though he is not holding a cup, just remaining against the wall.  -- and as Daisy pronounces 'the breast', the surgical table in the video rises up and spins, spilling its contents on the floor. The torso, all that remains of the President, falls onto the floor.  A spume of fresh blood and deep red wine rises up in front of the camera. Silverware is laid out on the counter behind. Only one figure, a doctor masked with the head of an ass, remains in frame, staring down at the tableau.   As the autopsy begins to fade, Hiro and Penny begin to speak as well:  "His sister hath protected his soul; hath repulsed the fiends, and turned aside calamities. She uttered the spell with the magical power of her mouth. Her tongue was perfect, and it never halted at a word. Beneficent in command and word was Isis, the woman of magical spells, the advocate of her brother. She sought him untiringly, she wandered round and round about this earth in sorrow, and she alighted not without finding him. She made light with her feathers, she created air with her wings, and she uttered the death wail for her brother. She raised up the inactive members of whose heart was still, she drew from him his essence, she made an heir, she reared the child in loneliness, and the place where he was not known, and he grew in strength and stature, and his hand was mighty in the House of Keb. The Company of the Gods rejoiced, rejoiced, at the coming of Horus, the son of Osiris, the spirit of Osiris, whose heart was firm, the triumphant, the son of Isis, the heir of Osiris."  Abel turns to the door from where he is standing, his grey eyes open and distant, standing near the back of the crowd that is watching the scene up on the stage.  [GO ON, LAUGH FUCKERS] "Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable." H. L. Mencken  PHENOMENON: Penny removed her street gear for a toga. The toga is the symbol of all that is well-learned, all that is philosophical and possessed of great knowledge. Earlier in the evening she decorated her skin with Pythagorean symbols, with glyphs from the Book of the Dead. These lend her an other-worldliness and she becomes, in the eyes of ravers, someone to be believed in. Someone like a leader.  ACTION & THEORY: It's a Mind effect. It's her job to begin the festivities, her job to get it started. This has always been her role. The first phrase "Bibamus, moriendum est!" means "Let us drink, death is inevitable." This is the cue she gives at all Invisible Parties. They raise their glasses and toast. She is reaching out to these open minds as she speaks the second phrase "Omne ignotum pro magnifico est!" which means "We have great notions of everything unknown" and encouraging them to see greater things than the lies on what is set before them. In this instance: the television screen. Penny, with the mere presence of her voice, is ushering these kids towards enlightenment."  OOC> Hiro mocks Penny. OOC> Penny says ""Ah crap. Well. There you have it."  "Those who have lain down in death rise up," the chorus pronounces vehemently.  "Those who have lain down in death rise up. They still breathe. The grave sings."  Then just Daisy: "The flesh is a vessel. Those who have lain down in death rise up. The grave sings. They still breathe."  The TV flickers. Behind the screen, the ghostly image of a skull appears, CRTs plugged into its empty sockets, circuitry inlaid in whorls about its crown. For a moment, the image of sallow flesh superimposes itself on the skull. Then the picture appears again:  Pillbox hats place the time of the event in the 1960s. Endless rows of tombstones roll into the grainy middle distance. Kennedy is being laid down on his funeral barge. The Eternal Flame burns on its prow. She is veiled, she is visible only from the back, but the flip to her hair is unmistakable: this is Jackie Kennedy. She lays Excalibur on the fallen President's chest, which rises once, then falls.   Jacqueline steps back from the barge. The barge departs for open water, and Daisy continues to chant, voice faltering.  Viktor looks around, confused, and wonders what the whole point of this is, as he does not get it.  Abel looks around the room to see how many drink.  Penny surfaces slowly. From where? From somehere below the decks. Just before the screen starts to fill with snow, she grabs the mic from infront of Hiro and puts her lips to the metal mesh  "Bibamus," her voice a purr compared to Daisy's chanting. Like she isn't really speaking at all. The crowd stirs, comes alive at once with a responding cry inunison with Penny "moriendum est!"  Hanging onto the mic cord, Penny leans back on Hiro, forehead tucked into his shoulder. She's smiling. She screams at them, at Hiro's headphone'd ear "Omne ignotum pro magnifico est!" and they raise up their plastic cups to drink fast.  Hiro turns to face the console, and raises his cup towards the mob - now swelled to almost ten times it's original size. The crowd has grown more diverse while no-one was looking - punks and gutter trash intermingling with ravers.   A hundred drink with him. Contents: finishes unfolding the black silk cloth to its full dimensions eight feet across and six feet wide. He sets it down over the bathtub as directed. He shakes his head, "No blood I'm afraid. Whomever embalmed him either did it with magic or got rid of it." He sets down his staff for a moment and spreads the cloth out a bit over something, a form that was certainly not anything in the bathtub. He looks at it for a moment, concentrates and then, with an almost theatrical gesture, grabs one end of the black cloth and yanks, flinging it off of the headless corpse of one Chase Kettle, Esq.  Viktor Taliesin Alexandre Daisy Niko Abel Hiro Obvious exits: Wharf WH  Streetside S    Hiro turns to face the console, and raises his cup towards the mob - now swelled to almost ten times it's original size. The crowd has grown more diverse while no-one was looking - punks and gutter trash intermingling with ravers.   A hundred drink with him.  "Drink to him," Daisy murmurs, dropping out of her chant. She grips the microphone with both hands, eyes beginning to roll into the back of her her head. "And if you have anything you wish you'd said to him -- you'd best say it quickly."  The moment of weakness, the break in her cadence, only lasts for a moment. Choking back tears, she continues:  “The grave is flesh. Those who have lain down still breathe. They still rise up. The flesh in death is become Osiris; the flesh of Osiris, divided, is become the gods. O Osiris, the Lord of Eternity, the flesh still sings to you. They still rise up. The grave rises up to sing to you. Those who have lain down in death have the flesh of Osiris. Those who have lain down still sing. O king; O Osiris The dead rise up and sing. Sing to the dead, O Osiris; the dead sing to you. They rise up. The grave rises up. Flesh becomes flesh. O Osiris, the dead still live. The flesh lives within us. There is no fear in us. Flesh becomes flesh. The grave sings to us."  "Rise up."  "Come back to us."  Hiro ducks down to retrieve a second record from the milk crate; sliding it smoothly onto the second turntable. One headphone is propped between shoulder and ear; he lays down the needle, giving the spindle a few quick twists. Hands move of their own accord; keying the sampler, bringing things into synch. His eyes are not on the decks; they are on the crowd. The speakers, still, give only their near-inaudible murmur.  Alexandre raises his cup in the air, whispers something to himself, then drinks the little bit quickly. He lowers his hand, looks around himself, then smiles slightly. He then manuevers out of the crowd he's found himself in.  Abel closes his eyes and bows his head, murmuring softly.  Taliesin seems to have gotten a cup from somewhere, and he closes his eyes finally before lifting it to drink with Hiro and the multitudes.  Abel mutters to Taliesin, "... One,... may perpetual..."  There is a stirring of something that starts just beyond the edge of perception. It hovers briefly above the forms on the dias, hanging there gently in mid-air supported by nothing at all. As eyes throughout the crowd lift to look upon the figure, it seemingly gains some semblance of solidity. To those who know him, the countenance is Chase Kettle, though now he is glorified. His eyes look down with fiery wisdom upon the gathered believers, arms outstretched as if to embrace them all in love.  Penny peels herself off Hiro's shoulder and hooks the mic back where it belongs. The few steps down to Daisy take her an eternity. Hands reach out to her, help her, guide her toward Daisy, move her in a back and forth weave. Dropping cups. Dropping. And looking up, staring at what could easily be part of the light show.  It's the beginning. "Daisy, daisy.." a whisper in the microphone. Together Penny and Daisy fail to collapse. Stoicly aright, they watch the crowd, sense the thing Hiro's about to do.  Hiro spreads his hands out across the decks, fingers hovering over the records in a gesture of silent supplication. Reflected in the lenses of his spectacles, glowing red numerals begin a backwards countdown from ten.  A wash of sound envelops the warehouse. The babel of a million disconnected voices, a million incomprehensible languages -- joined by the roar of the crowd. They are screaming; fists are raised; words loop back in on themselves, hidden microphone amplifying the screams, looping them over each other.  With a flourish of her arm, Daisy lifts the proferred plastic cup, then slumps in against Penny, trembling side pressed to hers. The beer is Keystone Light. The ergot is cheap blotter acid. The sentiment is the same.  "There ain't nothin' to fear," she says, maybe to Chase's apparition, maybe to Penny. "There ain't nothin'. There ain't nothin'. The grave sings to us."  Abel looks up at the figure of Chase... it's not the Chase he knew. He winces a bit at the screaming coming from the speakers.  And then: silence. This is when the lights kick in.  Hiro drops his hands. With them, the curtains on the high warehouse windows drop -- the cavernous space flooded with the light of the rising sun. Head tilted back, he passes his hands over the console: once, twice.  ...and a heavy baseline rises up out of the floor, music exploding over the sea of upturned faces. The roar returns - the unamplified screams competing with the music, which only grows louder.  A thumb hits the audio cut-out.  "Now, we forget. Dance, you fuckers." Six beats. And music returns as a palable force.  The apparition that is Chase Kettle is robed in white glory, an angel to create the pinnacle of the Heaven side of the party. To the more astute observer, this is no manufactured light show, no tell tale flickering or imperfection, just a simple peace that somehow manages to be carried throughout the assembly on the wild death cries manufactured by Hiro's sound system.  And then, the figure seems to be raising its arm in a benediction. Its spectral fingers close once its right arm reaches the apex of its arc and curls into a fist. A single 'Oi' is heard in the silence preceeding the music, and the figure vanishes, rising up on invisible wings.  Abel blinks at Chase again. "Oi."  From afar (to Penny, Hiro, and Daisy), Cassius realizes that sometimes there are players who make it all worth it. ;)  "Til death do us start," a cup pressed into Penny's hand out of a thin circle of writhing limbs. She drinks long, her cup fuller than it should be, holding Daisy or holding to Daisy.  And they dance. Those fuckers dance like angels on the head of a pin. All at once and without end, arms in the air. Groups of seven and seven and seven colliding, reforming, rolling into eachother and sliding like mercury.  Viktor yelps as he is suddenly assualted by a whole crowd. He starts making his way to the nearest side he can guestimate.  Abel gets pulled into a group of dancers. He looks a bit uncertain, then he glances back up to where Chase disappeared, and tries. He's slow to get into the rhythm of it, though... hesitant... And then, Abel smiles... no... he grins. The flashing lights around him reflect off of his sun symbol, he closes his eyes, and he begins to feel the music... the Time of it in his body... and he dances. And he laughs.  Viktor falls onto the stage, having made it away from the masses and he gasps, being out of breath. It looks like he got beat up a little. A little wide eyed, he looks for an exit and starts going for it.  Penny thumbs off Daisy's microphone before she drops it and feedbacks the whole sound system. When it does fall, it goes unnoticed kicked underfoot with other empty cups. The swaying masses start moving faster and faster syncing up and out of time with the beats-per-second thumping out across the warehouse.  Glitter and feathers everywhere, shining in the light of day. Somber to ecstatic in split seconds, the music climbs to a new pitch.  Taliesin whirls into the crowd both hands holding his staff high above his head. He shifts and flows as though he is keeping track of the bodies of everyone in the room. His spinning movements make him look like a sort of human helicopter as he rolls on through the crowd.  There is an explosion of flowers from above... white lilies fall upon the dancing masses. Probably just another special effect arranged for by the party's hosts. The funeral flowers pirouette as they descend into the masses below.  Niko has remained on the fringes of the group, watching the goings on, smiling a bit as he sees some break into dance. He moves back from the throng towards the doors, not leaving yet, but seemingly not intent on getting trampled either  Abel dances with his eyes closed. He isn't a dancer, but this isn't really dance is it... this is... this is celebration... this is something unformulated... And though his eyes are closed, and he doesn't move as well as your average raver, he doesn't get trampled... he weaves in and out of the crowd... merging and melding with it.  It comes on in waves. Hiro, hunched over the tables, captures one side of his headphones between ear and shoulder; fingers on the vinyl. The music feeds on itself; echoing ouroboros of sound following its own tail. A crescendo, the beat grows faster, faster, and ...break, cut, gone, a moment of silence, the tide ebbed--         --only to return in a tsunami, a beat skipped, a thumb released from the audio cut: the floor explodes.  Viktor shoves a little through the crowd, and makes his way to /an/ exit. He gasps for air and is then promptly pushed out as a dancer jumps or gets wild. Crashing into the door, he makes his way out.  OOC> Alexandre must crash. Neat stuff. Bye! Alexandre goes home. Alexandre has left.  OOC> Hiro says "I hate to do this guys, but I really gotta crash. I had to get up hella early for a class." OOC> Penny kinda has stuff in the morning, too. We'll do this next time NOT on a school night. OOC> Taliesin says "Night Hiro." OOC> Taliesin says "Night Penny." OOC> Abel says "Night Guys"  Abel waeves his way through the crowd toward where Daisy and Penny are nearly crashed.  Niko smiles and if he catches the eyes of the hosts, nods softly before slipping ou tthe door himself OOC> Hiro says "Hope you guys enjoyed the show. Next time, we'll actually throw a proper party ;)" OOC> Abel says "great party" OOC> Niko says "Very different :)" OOC> Hiro says "Funerals are boring. -_^" Hiro escapes OOC. Hiro has left.

      Abel walks out of the council chamber doors with a pensive look on his face.  Penny sits somewhere in the vicinity of the fire. Infront of her are a number of items - her bag, a stack of unopened flyers, a few records. Palm-and-pocketing something small she looks up and over toward the chamber doors like she was expecting someone else. "Evenin'..." she offers, a hesitating drawl.  Abel nods to Penny. "Evening. I assume you're getting ready for the goodbye to Chase tomorrow?"  "Iguesssoyeah," quick and tightly wound words, the sound of her voice sharp. Like tacks on glass, the tongue behind her teeth a desert. "Tal's bein'a real humanitarian about it, yeah? Nice guy, real mensch" nodding to herself, nodding to the floor and to the fire. Nodding in a way to the fire watching the flames without really seeing it. "Most everything's done. Daze, Piggy .. they got it under control. Just," indicating the pile of flyers wrapped in brown paper "distribution what needs doin'.  Abel nods slowly. "I'll try to be there, but I may have to head toward Michigan." He sighs. "Alyx's body is on a garbage barge on it's way there." He looks sad.  Penny pats the floor "C'mere," the lazy flop of her hand, the boneless gesture of a drug coming on strong "Come sit with me. Why is she on a barge? I haven't seen that girl in months. What happened?" She tries to do that thing with her hand again, but only moves her shoulder and elbow - needs the hand to keep her upright.  "Jesus."  Funny, the things we say, how we term our surprise. Penny shudders a little, shock surfacing but only briefly "That's pretty fucking awful." Penny doesn't say anything for a long time. Each time she tries the fire cracks, pops or hisses at that odd interval. Like it doesn't want her to speak. "I didn't know," finally. Slowly. Tarred up is what she is, maybe nodding off with her eyes open "Gonnahaftadosomethingaboutallthis."  Abel nods. "We don't know who did it, though. We'll find out when we bring her back."  Penny moves her tongue around in her mouth the way people do when they taste something bitter. When they taste bile. She rubs a hand over her face, her tired eyes.  "I hope I never find out."  Abel nods and starts to stand. "I ned to go. I should probably get a few things together... to see about getting a the money to rent a boat. Aaron can run one, but he can't get cash or the technos will find him.  Penny nods a few more times "Should ask Pobs. He might have some floating around," cash, she means. "T'care, Abel. See you later," she says with limited enthusiasm or none at all.  Abel nods. "I'll to that Penny. Peace be with you and Providence guide your steps." He finishes standing and, with a wave of farewell, heads toward the door out of Novus.

      Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Contents: Catherine Alex Viktor Niko Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers     You return IC ...   Niko smiles, 'She gave up her family and friends to be with me..I don't want her caught because I didn't get the best...and she doesn't know who she wants to lead.."    Viktor says "night" Viktor has disconnected. Niko looks to Alex, "Besides...I'm going to push their offer to provide support and see if it's serious  Viktor thinks for a moment and heads to the library. "Well, I'm off to do some research. I'll see you all later."  //.etro: It is 06:10 am, early morning, on Sunday the 22. day of March, 2009.  "Later,"Alex says to Viktor with a small nod as the man heads toward the library.  Was Penny always there? Hard to say, things not being as linear as they could be. Regardless, she's there now. Between a few short, quick steps her phone beeps and while it may be true that certain grids can not be accessed out here in the nowhere, other particular matricies are always available.  Skirting the hearth, she advances on a place just to the left of the library. Just a few days ago a shroud of a sort was laid out. The strong smell hovers in that general area but nowhere else in the hall.  The phone is still beeping when Penny tugs it, and a smoke, out of her pocket. She thumbs the buttons for a few seconds until it's quiet.  Cassius pages: Alright, you get a message back saying. Wil du. Luv u. You paged Cassius with 'Texting back: Body was hidden .. here? Need 2 bring it 2 our place.'. Cassius pages: Hard 2 do Big guys will stop. You paged Cassius with 'Y? We need 2 lay him 2 rest. 2morrow. things 2 do.'. Cassius pages: Big guys wont let me take things from the place You paged Cassius with 'Will carry him myself then. where is he?'.   Catherine looks at you She says something short in a language you don't understand.  she yawns...hiding it behind her hand.  Alex glances over to Penny when she step into the room. "Come back for the rest of Chase?..." he asks her, a slight frown coming to his face.  Niko smiles to Cathy, 'then come and curl up with me and I'll carry you to bed after..'  Connelly 's sleeping on the floor in a corner of the room.... Catherine does just so, resting her head against Niko..  Penny has the bearing and mien of a person teetering on the far side of rational. Her shoulders too stiff, her posture too erect. The corner of her mouth twists, up. Down. The dead-white crust in corners, she is thin-lipped. Her gaze fixes on the phone. She thumbs something out on the keypad and looks toward Alex, her eyes rimmed red and peeled wide open "Yes."  Catherine does fall asleep...  "Oh,"Alex says with a smirk, almost a chuckle,"Too bad he is not here... But I am curious... What is it that you had planned to do with Chase's head and body?..."  Niko sits on a divan with Cathy salseep and resting across his lap as he toys with her hair and just watches on  Taliesin enters the Hall from the Library. Taliesin has arrived.  Taliesin comes out of the library and starts walking in the direction of the council chambers.  Niko sees tal enter and doesn't pause to say hello or anything else, 'tal..you wouldn't be an Adept of Ars Animae by any chance...woul dyou?"  Alex is standing by the hearth in the same area where Niko is seated. His eyes, however, are on Penny. Perhaps waiting for a response or a reaction.  Taliesin comes to a halt when Niko addresses him, "An Adept of Ars Anime? No, I'm afraid not. I've been focusing my studies on the sphere of Prime lately. Why what do you need a Life adept for?"  Niko smiles to tal, 'Well..now I have to add to my request..need an Adept of Life to make the changes to Cathy..I can change my face..not hers  The tap-click-beep-beep noise of Penny-with-the-phone is a constant throughout the conversation. She doesn't look down as she types, operating by feel. A sandpaper sound comes out where her voice is requisite "It was said already. There is a letter to follow, instructions" she emphasizes "hoc monumentum heredem exterum non sequitur."  It's possible that she believe this should make sense.   Taliesin ahs softly, "I may have a solution to that. I'll get to work on it." He glances over at Penny, "How are you using a cellphone here? I can't believe you're even within roaming range. I know mine doesn't work?"  "And when I asked to see this... letter, while you were stealing Chase's head at gun point, you gave me an envelope full of dried leaves...." Alex says in response to Penny's statement,"I would think that, as a leader of this Chantry, what is done with Chase's body is a Chantry matter."  Pobble enters the Main Hall through the Fields, closing the massive double doors behind him. Pobble has arrived.  "I never pointed a gun at you, Alex" her declaration a means to free her from that conversation, ending with "we are his next-of-kin and are due his remains." Quiet for a few minutes while she rearranges the three shrouds ontop of one another, Penny pockets the phone "It doesn't work," pushing the jet stones and other detrius into the center of the plastic sheets "it only talks to god."  Kneeling, Penny looks at her work, unsatisfied and fixated.  Pobble pushes the door open, allowing a suited monkey to scamper through, trailing a luminescent exhaust of cigar fumage in its wake. Sashaying behind the smokestack is a hooded man, black coat worn closed with the oversized hood shrouding his features in shadow. The fine shoes tap on the stone, as the man follows monkey into the chamber. A cigarette dangles precariously from thin blood stained fingers, the claret glinting fresh as the cherry ember sparkles on silver fingernails.  The pair come to a stop, suddenly and as one. The motion whips the heavy smoke around and in an overly dramatic manner, the fellow throws back his hood. The empty eyes of Dr Steve are revealed. Emaciated and haggard, his head shifts in the only indication that he scans the room, given the blank eyes.  Taliesin nods slowly to Penny, her commentary about her cellphone's abilities at communion being left alone for now. He asks, expecting that someone will know the answers, "Where is the body now? It should be handed over to them, as soon as possible. When will the College be holding the memorial? I know that myself and some others would like to attend."  Niko hmms a little, 'It's not a memorial they are doing...not right off, anyway.."  //.etro: It is 07:28 am, mid-morning, on Sunday the 22. day of March, 2009.  Alex let's out a sharp bark of a laugh,"Is /that/ what they were doing when they hacked into Chase's head with a kitchen knife?... Preparing for a memorial?..." he asks seeming rather doubtful of that explaination.  Taliesin raises a finger to the two Virtual Adepts, "Gentlemen, before you start in on defending the dignity of the corpse of a man that neither one of you was particularly fond of, I would like to speak with Penny about this. As a leader of the Chantry it is right that I should do so." He motions for Penny, Pobble and Dave to join him in the library.   Niko gives Tal a look and frowns a bit, "Make sure you run a lie detector.."  Penny stops what she was doing with the positioning of the plastic, muttering something about the squares not holding the circles. She stops because Pobble walked in. Instinct guides a hand from the floor to her side, the way a person looking to arm themselves might keep a loaded gun. The left hand from the floor to her right side stays there and does not move.  Dave Monkey nods, "S'right." he says slowly, waving his cigar around indignantly. "I'd have said he'd've rather 'ad is head cut awf that spent a quiet weekend with yous." The obnoxiously little monkey begins to swagger across towards Taliesin. The latter comment from Niko causes the fella to stop and he goes to say something but a following Pobble ends the statement pre-emptively with a kick to the rear. The monkey moves on but Dr Steve pauses to stare at Niko, "You are certainly full of insinuations today young man.." he says in a hoarse whisper, dried blood flaking on his cracked lips. "You should becareful where you aim such weapons of disunity." This said, he moves towards Penny and offers her his arm.  Niko glances to Dave and smiles, 'If daisy had not told me precisely what you all were looking to do, then I would not be so worried with your behavior..". He offers an obvious fake smile to Dave, 'And don't go calling me 'young man'."  Seemingly amused by Dave's antics, Taliesin offers Niko a slight smile, "I'm sure I can handle things just fine." He stands patiently waiting for the members of the Invisible College to proceed him into the library.  "First of all, Tal,"Alex says turning toward the man,"You are wrong about me not liking my former cabalmate. And second, Penny would not of had to come here, guns drawn, if there was any explaination as to what they were doing with Chase's head and body."           This fine gentleman is probably in the 25-30 age bracket, and is posessed of an unhealthy pallor, his skin having a washed out look to it as if he's been dry cleaned one too many times. Haircut looks to be home made, low grade clippers job but just a little patchy in places where there are hints of blue in the stubble. His eyes are apparently fitted with some form of contact lens, since they are a pale milky white with no iris or pupil visible. His pallid skin is contrasted by the adornments that mark it. Besides the peircings (1) there are numerous tattoos, the main design being a series of small black marks that ring his head in a strip about an inch wide reminiscent of a crown of thorns laden with black ink. Under his left eye, starting at the peak of the cheekbone are three thin vertical black lines, varying sizes with the middle the longest at about an inch. Finally, an abstract design formed from intersecting black and white squares, about the size of a silver dollar adorns his neck on the right.          Dressed to impress in a four figure suit in a black that purposefully looks a touch faded. Its appears to have been fitted perfectly, but the stylistic crispness is convoluted into a more casual style by virtue of an unbuttoned jacket, and the white crinkled silk shirt worn untucked with its top button open. The cuffs of the shirt protrude at perfect lengths, fastened with flat round headed cuffs consisting of blank white circles. The hands that emerge from the expert tailoring are also thin and on the pale side, accentuated by patches of dried blood (2). Precisely pressed and creased pants with precision turnups and length are finished up by a pair of stylish black shoes that appear both classy and designed for duty with thick soles and what could be steel toe caps.          Cold repelling is perfomed by a full length black crushed velvet overcoat, apparently with an added inner lining. In contrast to the fine attire beneath, the velvet hasn't held up too well in the snow and rain and is starting to become patchy in places while having that drowned rat look to it while wet. It has an oversized hood, and deep out-side pockets.          He speaks with a South London accent, sounding quite common at times no matter the covabluary he wields. He moves wearily, as if each motion is a true feat of willpower and each step a mile.      Penny seems to wince at the offer, seems to recoil from Pobble or Dave, seems to give a great deal of consideration to his extended hand and none at all to the conversation going on around her. Equal parts fear and delerium keep her quite motionless, a wide open stare travelling slowly upwards. Caught her own reflection in the shine of Pobble's shoes, Penny winces again.  "..not just yet," she whispers to the steel toes, taking his bloodied hand. Is it then that her hand becomes red as well? or was it before... "cycle hasn't resolved."  Dave Monkey mutters as he heads into the library, casting a look back at Niko, pointing his cigar as if it were a rifle. It could be, its the right size. No shot however, Dave Monkey, saving the lives of those he despises. He whispers into the momentary silence. "I have every right to call you boy if I wish. Do not condescend the monkey. The monkey is ancient. The monkey has many friends across many layers of existence. The monkey takes no prisoners." This is said with remarkable venom.  Dr Steve smiles, sadly. As if an act of simple kindness had destroyed the world. A slight nod, and a gentle squeeze of Pen's hand. He then leads her to the library in silence. There is an air of resignation about his motions when close to Penny, his wasted features growing sadder still.  "I think the chimp just threatened you Niko,"Alex says as he moves to take a seat in a nearby armchair.  Niko looks to Alex, "He'll throw feces next, I'm sure.."  You head to the door marked 'Library' and head through into the room beyond. Novus Valnastium -- Library          High shelves, comfortable chairs, warm lights, and wide tables adorn this room. Large rugs of various types of fur spread out, here and there. On one wall is a hearth that seems to always burn with a quiet, warm flame. This room is a bibliophile's dream, with books on magick, books on history, in fact, books on almost anything one might think about.         Currently, most of the books are still away, packed in Hermetically sealed crates which line the walls of the room. Soon, though, the boxes will be unpacked and the library will be complete.  Obvious exits: Out     Pobble enters the Library from the Main Hall. Pobble has arrived.  Taliesin enters the Library from the Main Hall. Taliesin has arrived.  Taliesin follows shortly thereafter and closes the door behind him. He looks at the three of you, "Can you guys tell me what's going on? I'm more than willing to help you memorialize Chase, but I need to know what the hub bub is all about."  Dave Monkey says, "Awright Tal me ole mucka." The indignance of youth forgotten it seems, the Monkey hops into a chair and performs admirably the task of looking happy for the entire Colledge. Matted fur around the eyes attests otherwise maybe, but for now those saucer pupils are filled with something that resembles glee.  Dr Steve comes to stand near Dave. Releasing Penny he seems to slump down as if a great weight has been returned to his neck, Steve Atlas. The chair seems to be the only thing supporting his defiance of the tyranny of gravity. His head shifts, eyes possibly moving to Penny to allow her to explain.   The monkey, ill conceived little steward that he is, leads the way for the strained couple. She folds herself down to the side of the chair, not for lack of strength but because just at that moment Dave, Pobble and Penny exist in a kind of Raphaelite symmetry.  "It's to do with dates. Time, really. It's the right time." A pause, her voice still paperthin and erraticly octaved "Um. I'm sorry who are you? I don't think we've .. met."   The other two nod solemnly at this. Eerily in time with one another. Questioning looks await response.  This earns a look for Dr. Steve and Dave from Taliesin. He sighs and grips his white oak staff taking a deep breath before speaking, "Penny, I am Taliesin Emrys. I'm a Celestial Chorister and I'm a friend of Chase. I'm trying to figure out what is going on with his remains that has caused such a problem. I'm not understanding your explanation, so if you could try to explain it to me, more simply. I'd appreciate it."  Penny ohs, maybe making a mental note. Studying Tal, intent on his staff, his posture, she brings a knee up, readjusting her position on the floor. Hooking an elbow around it, she rests her head, a dark bloodied palm-print left on the black jeans.   "It isn't my .. I haven't got the words .." a pregnant pause, like she's waiting for an invitation.  Taliesin is really trying here, "Ms. Ante, I need you to try please. This is causing trouble that Chase would not have wished. I want to help you do right by Chase, but I need you to help me do that."  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 4          For a total of 1 success(es).  Penny shifts again to pull a notepad and a sharpie from the apron pocket she sits on. There's another uncomfortable moment where Penny just stares at Tal. All processes pending circulation. The sense of muted urgency breaks when she teeths the cap off, grips the pen. In a quick hand she writes the words REQUIESCAT IN PACE on the notepad, a rectangle, scribbles that look nothing like the english-letter alphabet, a discoball, a television and seven stick-figures in a circle. She rips the page off the top, a bloody thumbprint set squarely inside the stick-figures.  "Here, here" holding the note out for him.  Taliesin takes the paper, looks at it and nods. "I see. What were you guys doing with his head though? Was there something you were trying to get out?"  Pobble has disconnected.  It's not the strongest projection ever built but it conveys enough; that they're giving Chase his due; a bacchanal.  Penny slumps back to the chair and looks up at Pobble before rasping, scratching something from the corner of her mouth "His skull of course. And the pieces that did not belong to him. Part of the deal. Return to sender."  Taliesin ahs softly, "He had some sort of implant then? And you guys were taking it out to send it back to the person who gave it to him?"  Penny nods, folding away the notepad, capping the marker. It isn't so much that she's dumb or mute but that she can not get cohesive. A twitch here, a shiver there; subtle signs of a hunger strike.  Taliesin nods slowly, "Very well. I will have the body ready for the Invisible College to take care of in short order. If you would let me know who you're sending the implant to as well, so I can make sure they receive it, and so the others will know what's going on. I would appreciate that as well."  Taliesin sings a few bars under his breath and the pangs of hunger and deprivation fade into memory. He smiles, "No need to suffer like that any longer, Ms. Ante."  Penny shouts, "NO!"  Taliesin takes a step back, "What's the matter? Are you alright? I'll have the body for you as soon as I can. There was no need." He looks worried that perhaps he has done something wrong unintentionally.  Penny lurches forward like she could reach what was just slipped out of her grasp. She makes a noise, a wail, a cry "No! It's necessary! The letter.. " looking at Pobble who has succumbed, has passed out or slipped unconcious for minutes at a time. She raises fingers to her mouth, still chapped? "..you don't know anything!"  Taliesin smacks himself on the forehead. "My apologies." He looks ashamed of himself. "I was only trying to help. I will set you back the way you were, Ms. Ante, but before I do, is one of you remaining healthy enough to plan the bacchanal?"  Dave panicks and scoots out of sight. He's seen Penny at her shrieking, terrorizing worst, he knows better than to stick around.  "It's done," getting up knees to feet "Put it back, give it back," stumbling down as she crosses the room, tripping over the apron strings. "..give it back.."  Penny shouts, "Put it back, give it back!"  Taliesin nods, "I shall." He pulls out a stick on incense, "This is very important, before you leave, I want you to take this and burn it. I'm going to put a blessing on it that the Chorus often uses when subjecting ourselves to similar privation. If you burn it those who inhale the smoke of the incense will be able to endure your privation with greater grace. It is up to you if you wish to use it, but I respect what you're doing and want to help." He bows his head, "Lord, please forgive Your servant who has interfered with the sacrifice of another, please forgive me my foolish pride and restore the sacrifice made in the name of a friend." The pains of hunger wrack your body once more and once again it becomes difficult to think clearly due to your grumbling and forlorn stomach. He focuses on the incense and prays over it for a few moments and puts it in your bloodied hand.    Taliesin says "Eseentially if you burn it, anyone in the area who inhales the smoke will be able to deal with extreme hunger... think of it as a stamina boost directed toward exactly that."   Taliesin says "I need to go nini now."   Penny says "That's excellent."   Penny says "I'll letcha go. Say. Before you go?"   Taliesin says "Yes?"   Penny says "You're getting the body to us ..so that means I don't have to haul it out of here myself?"    Taliesin says "Right."   Taliesin says "Just let me know where you need it to go with a +mail or the like."   Penny says "Okay. Thank you. This was excellent."   Taliesin will have to recover it first of course, but that's my problem now.   Penny nodsnods. Taliesin leaves by way of the double doors, entering the Main Hall. Taliesin has left.   You open the double doors, returning to the Main Hall. Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Contents: Alex Niko Connelly Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers      Alex is seated quietly in one of the armchair, his shade covered eyes looking in the direction of the library door.  The library door opens again. And Penny doesn't so much walk out as she shuffles between short spasms of breath. By and large this was the way she entered the room but for the very faint, very thin sheen of sweat that's broken across her features. Even now as she returns to the hall this sweat seems to be evaporating, her left hand still bloodied. The strings of the apron are rednow as well and her knee bears a dark handprint.  "What," she rasps "you were expecting someone else?"  Alex doesn't bother to answer Penny's question and his eyes don't move either. In fact, he doesn't move much at all.  Penny shrugs her jacket back the right way, the nylon making that slithery noise as she zippers it. "Whatever. Jackass." Short on words and patience in low supply, she stuffs her fists into the pockets. Penny walks toward the door slowly; her body just as stiffly resolute as when she walked in.  A faint smile creeps to Alex lips; as if Penny's words where a victory on his part. Still he remains silent and still.  Penny snorts then starts coughing. It's a terrible, colicky sound that rattles from deep, deep in the lung. She stops to try and control it, working the flem up, up and spits it to the stone floor.  Spitting on the truth, some people call it. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and leaves the hall still clearing her throat. You open the double doors and head out into the open, rolling fields beyond.

      _________________________  //.etro: Toronto by Night _________________________                              //.etro-logical Data                              ______________________________________________________________________________  It is 20:13 on Tuesday the 07. day of April 2009.  Sunrise:    5:25     Sunset:  18:34 Moonrise:  03:20     Moonset: 13:27 It is week 1 of the month and the waning crescent moon is not up. The tide is high and rising. A cool breeze blows from the west, driving dark clouds before it which blot  out the stars in patches overhead. Elsewhere they glitter brightly in the dark sapphire sky. ______________________________________________________________________________ The Rose Tearoom(#1214RlJM)   A renovated older building on the corner hosts a cosy little tea house. A  small sign hanging over the door proclaims it to be 'The Rose Tearoom'.  You open the door and enter the tearoom. The Rose Tearoom(#1214RlJM)       Upon entering this tea room, it's evident that either the establishment was named for the decor, or decorated to match the name. Though there's nothing gaudy or glaring, roses do seem to be a major theme in the style of the room. Small tables seem to be the norm here, though there are several places where larger groups can be seated. The tables themselves are masterpieces of creation, having the look of handmade quality. Oak surfaces glow from frequent polishings, the legs of each carved to depict roses on trailing vines that circle the leg all the way to the floor. The chairs surrounding the tables are also of oak, though soft cushions have been placed upon the seats, making them comfortable. The floor itself is also hardwood, though woven rugs placed here and there give it a comfortable, warm feeling. The walls have been painted a soft shade of dusty rose, with a wallpaper trim running along the top, where wall meets ceiling, decorated with white roses against a wine-red background. Large windows face the street, of beautiful stained glass, depicting vivid red, white, and pink roses. Towards the back, a long counter runs along the length of the room, where people can sit, or simply place orders, though waitresses also circle the room. Behind the counter are two doors, one of which leads into the kitchen, the other to a staircase leading to the second floor, though this door is locked, with a sign that reads: Private. Music plays constantly, though at a soft volume, ranging from classical to soft jazz, though it's always instrumental, and never vocal. Decorating every table is a vase, with a single, freshcut rose.      Flames burn brightly, encased within hurricane lamps at the center of every table, providing more illumination than one might expect. Discreet overhead lighting also sheds it's glow onto the room, so that the light level remains soft and diffuse, but ample enough to see clearly.      Looking outside, you can see it's fair and mild, with a few clouds in the sky.                          ** Places and +views present **  Obvious exits: Private Door U  Out O  Tom enters from the street. Tom has arrived.  It's a pleasant walk from Union Station and the lake is gorgeous. Tom is back in Toronto after his prolonged absence fighting the good fight on the island of Rhodes where against some incredible Globalization-Struggle-Rioting backdrop he did do ferocious battle against some hidden conspiracy of Nazi financiers/media conglomerate owners wherein he defeated, once more, the excesses of the foul advertising industry coupled with the unthinking excesses of global money-power, in so doing, vindicating the righteous power of the mass media to do good and righteous service to the global citizens of Starship Earth...          Man. If only that were true, he wouldn't look so beatdown. There's something about Tom that looks beat like a drum - his hangdog face, the general lack of focus and clarity in his often energized eyes, the 'I simply do not give a fuck' adjustment of his tie, the knot falling quite short of tidy. His amble into the room is aimless, his gaze simply a skitter of sight against rose, red, red red rose, his posture is stooped, his hands clammy. One holds a travelling briefcase. The other tenses... untenses. Tonight is one of those nights. Going to be a tough one to get through. Sweat beads on his forehead. His internal biochemistry is gone haywire. Tom is coming undone at the seams.  On nights like this, the tea room loses most of its patrons. Warm nights, no traffic.  They should have outside seating; a place where people talk, enjoy a lull, leave change, move on. As it happens, as it so often is the case, the interior mimicks the exterior - very little traffic, warm and pleasant. Certain dialogues exist on certain levels but it's white noise. Impossible to zero in on one particular conversation, insane to discern the nuance of laungages. There's only so much french you can listen to until it becomes a boring nasal drone.  Of course, there's Penny. Strikingly gaunt and towheaded against the muted mauves. Headphones on her table, jacket slung back across the chair. Scarves of steam rise up from the cup of tea in front of her, a little to the left. Threading her fingers together, she watches Tom-the-antithesis-of-calm with her head canted.  And, of course, travel will do this to you. A trans-Atlantic flight is a very  long time in a very uncomfortable environment that absolutely no evolutionary  mechanisms prepare you for.  A night, a week, sometimes even a month is not enough to recover after a particularly strenuous odyssey from home. Especially not when you find yourself, just for instance, waking up at five in the morning because where you were, it's noon. /Especially/ not if you find yourself in the very real situation of being up and moving at eight thirty six pm when it is to you three in the morning.  This is how Tom finds himself here, his eyes blind, ears deaf, even his nose blocked to the rich exchange of information in the form of hand-jive, the patois of invisibly evolving underground linguistic structures, even the careful cryptography of chemical precursors to amino acids that float in specially prepared tea. The entire universe is information, and it offers up a bounty to those willing to open themselves to cosmic patternings. But Tom just can't be fucked to do it, just now, sorry. Instead, the world washes over him in a wave, meaningless, senseless. Arbitrary, imagined, just as it is, as it always has been - without interpretation or the imposition of personal meaning on the recognition of structures. A pair of quarreling lovers don't remind him of a girl in Budapest he nearly married -- instead, they are strangers and it is none of his business. It is a frightful state to be in, and Tom is aware of it, only this, how out of character he is, how utterly not himself he feels, how distant and dissociated he feels from his ordinary self (or even his extraordinary self which is largely something of a secret and especially from his extraextraordinary self which today is given to napping and the occasional emergence in a clumsy, crabby moment).         Tom sits without art or technique in an elegantly carved oak chair perilously close to the secret friend whose name he's never known, the girl who has always been here and yet who he has always been unaware of. He puts the briefcase down carelessly - as a result, it topples with a loudish bang - he doesn't even start. He just opens the front of his jacket and slumps, giving himself over to a hyperfocused study of the rose on his table, vibrant and full.  That one face in a swell of unknowns. Any other soldier home from the war would go running. Would move with the tide of humanity, know his place in it and understand the destination as home, as safe, as terra firma. A place of rest. Like magnetic north draws all compass points, the seat with its back to Penny is the only obvious stopping point. She behaves as a long-term fixture, the way old men feeding birds in the park do. Moving minimally, making adjustments only with two fingers here. Two fingers there. To her shirt, the jacket. Shoving cup and saucer gently toward the center of the table. Her arrangement is methodical - the very slow and organized taking stock of herself. It's the point of all good neighbors to be only as involved as necessary; to keep all things hers beyond the point of interruption. That side of the fence.         Moving deeper into the zone, Penny peels off a sticker from her headphones and seals it to the table, pulls out a marker and chews on the cap. For a little while this mutual silence evolves in a sequence of sighs and shifting. Taptaping. Spoon drummed on the china.  "Ave," Penny says, subvocalized.  Isn't this the sort of thing that Tom gets all fucking worked out of shape over? Or he's supposed to, anyway. That's what he gets paid this respectable little salary (with benefits and vacation days and plenty of life insure) to do. To get worked up over things that aren't any of his business. To bust heads for holding thoughts that are, really, none of his business.  The peeping tom brigade. The sacrosanct order of reality puritans. Big BrXXXXXXXXXX you. (Classified for security reasons -- your eyes only.) Well, not tonight. Either Tom doesn't care -- or more likely -- he hasn't the energy or desire to notice whatever shenanigan is going on. Society will manage itself nicely without him for an evening. Society always does, always has, always will. Society is an organism. An organism that isn't properly maintained will collapse. An organism at the point of collapse is a danger not to itself but to the organisms immediately bordering it... death, putrefaction, corruption of the flesh, infection, pockets of bile, pus, poison all result.  Tom takes a bottle of poison from his pocket and opens it up. Now, he needs poison to function. He taps two pills into his palm, and swallows them dry. One, first. Into the mouth, over the tongue, down the throat with a grimace. The second, into the mouth, can't get it down, waitwaitwait saliva corrodes the time-release capsule the foul taste on his tongue and down it goes. He dabs the corners of his eyes with the napkin, and hardly notices even that he's done it.  Whales, dolphins, and humans are the only mammals with salt-water secreting ducts at the corners of the eye. They say that humans evolved into whales and dolphins -- they spent so much time in warm, seasonable water that they went native, they evolved to fit it, they left the whole poisonous clusterfuck of human interaction for the embrace of the seas where a whole other show was going on, involving poetry, love, and brotherhood. That's what they say.  Radiating a monday after-work turmoil so deep into a Tuesday keeps everyone else minding their own business or minding Tom's. That couple twice removed in the scheme of things now take turns with a furtive glance. Is he? Isn't he. Homicidal? Derranged. Assumptions scribed in the lines of downturned mouths, twists in a napkin, crowsfeet crinkling in squints;  Pill-popping power broker. Fired. On a bender. They look at his hands and take the imagined story further. Bachelor. Lives in a studio. Never seen the inside of a gym.  Penny doesn't look. Can't very well turn around and offer conversation. Not yet. the atmosphere is thick, tension bouncing off the normally tranquil setting walls. Even the tiny lights in the hurricane lamps flare and spark. Working fingers away from the goetia surrounding her, Penny tips two out toward the room. The universal signal to a waitress. Two.  Without much delay a small woman wearing a small apron, stooped low to the ground by arthritis and poor nutrition in her better days, shuffles into the room (her way around the counter was a journey bracketed by cracking bones and gutteral grunts) with a cup and a pot of hot water. She makes her way toward Penny, smiling toothless, her eyes lost dots in the crinkled lattice of puffy eye skin and jowl. In broken english, the waitress coughs "Water, yes. Yes," pleasant, happy to be useful and doing something, not shored up in the network of socialist homes for the aging "other cup? you?"  Penny shakes her head, nods backward indicating Tom. The waitress nods like she knows the score and sets it and the saucer down. Gruff "Meelk, shoogar" pointing a bony finger at the accoutrements on the table. The tiny tin can of milk. The lidded bowl with the tiny spoon of sugar.  The waitress pours water from her one-shot tea pot, shuffles away and it's almost like you can feel the heat warming the thin walls of the porcelin. The sensation is not startling so much as it feels like the atmosphere of the tea room is finally seeping in. Into your bones and behind your eyes, a tranquil, easy feeling.  The drugs, perhaps. They kicked in sometime after the refugee from the People's States of Europe set down the tea Tom didn't ask for but didn't have any goddamn energy at all to send back -- too busy getting the childproof cap back on, too busy keeping the bile down, too busy ignoring the pointed stares, the accusatory glances from people who are here by design of the Universe specifically to pry into his business. There is a somehow appropriate inversion of values and status here.  But Tom, well. He's already looking up, bottle in jacket pocket, contemplating with much more weight than necessary the not-quite-tranquil surface of the tea. Invisible eddies of air stir the liquid. Convection currents within the cup echo the stirring motion of the faint breeze, and make with their own answering distortions of the hot tea, liquid joined by surface tension. As above, so below. In the world, there is pain and hurt. Now, Tom, who has put himself into step with the world, is filled with pain and hurt. But Tom wants the world to be filled with love and knowledge -- so he lets the love and knowledge regenerate within him. He is too busy contemplating drinking the tea to vomit -- he is too busy enjoying the perverse satisfaction of his penance, to be snooped upon, to bother to snoop on the snoopers. Let them stare! Tom will drink his tea.  And he does. Tom lifts the cup and holds it in his cupped palms. The Chinese have a saying -- too hot to hold, too hot to drink. And it is, but still, he does. Only a little, a sip, and it goes down easy... and he sips a bit more, just a bit, not enough to be really hot, to do a lot of damage... but to remind him he is, you know, alive. And for now, Tom does not question where this tea came from (indeed, to his mind, the salvation has the face of a wrinkled, shrunken woman in advanced stages of collapse), or how or why... in fact, he doesn't question at all. He sips. Relaxed. Content. Evolutionarily satisfied.  Better. Everything, it seems, will be alright. This sensation permeates, changes perception and things begin to slow down. It's warm and pleasant and certain dialogues have begun to disappear; like so much vapor. The door has performed its function, swinging open and closed time and again. People, customers and off-shift waitresses, leave the tea room. It's not a hurried leave-taking but an amiable parting. Perhaps they overtip. Maybe they kiss and make-up. Behind the bar at the back, there's a kind of cleaning up happening. Neatening, straightening, wiping down. A younger waitress thumps her way down the little aisle in thick-heeled shoes. Quick swipes across both occupied tables; she even rights the fallen comrade briefcase.  Penny moves for the first time since the waitress left, her wrist, elbow, vertebrae cracking loudly - protesting the sudden flexing. There are not the noises of a body that wants to move. Like a stick-figure pulled reluctantly off the page, Penny shifts. The chair creaks, rivets in the wood carving released from incidental weight; she was never part of the tree it came from. Never had to bear the pressure of the wind, the pull of the root, the fall of the axe.  Somewhere a clock ticks. The inner workings loud, suddenly.  She touches her teacup, stirring the hot water inside, with a sugar-crusted spoon. Her mouth makes a long slurping sound when she sips and slouches further in the chair. Further in the background are the noises of plates being stacked.  Like so much vapor, the tea disappears into Tom. Warm and flowing, it floats down into the digestive system and out into the capillaries and veins and arteries and other mechanisms of irrigation. Warm water and Lord knows what else reinvigorate a damaged system. The organism was damaged - now, the damage seems put at bay if not addressed completely.  The room empties out, molecules spinning off and away. Like a vapor, like a gas, humanity in the tea room dissipates. Tom serenely sips, some weary office buddha who has found his contentment. Who knows what thoughts boil through that head? Who knows what plans, what misty-eyed schemes for global brotherhood are being rewound, given a second try, in this rare moment of harmony and all-togetherness. The sweat has dried, the hair is matted. Tom will live.  And he goes. He stands up without weariness, without complaint -- the mind/body dichotomy has been subdued, and his body no longer serves the mind unwillingly like a put-upon serf, but rather in the uncomplaining manner of a lover fetching a lost item of his beloved. Each task is performed with uncomplaining devotion - why should it not be so? The two are one!  Tom leaves a generous tip for the waitstaff on his table, and stoops to grasp the once-fallen, now-righted briefcase. The two have much in common -- the universe is a swarm of symbolic relationships and occulted meanings. With a clearer mind and an easier step, he walks back out into the luxuriously warm night to do things unguessed at.

      through the line and orders fries and a coke, then settles in a seat near the counter and begins to survey name badges.  To those who know her from her party persona, Daisy would be virtually unrecognizable: she's wearing a garish red and yellow polo, and her Bettie Page bob is piled up underneath a baseball cap on top of her cab. At the moment, she's the only one working the McDonald's counter.   Perhaps "working" is an exaggeration: she's listlessly daubing at it with a dingy grey cloth while staring across the mall.  Name tag? No dice.  Daisy's reads 'Sandra'.  What, you thought 'Daisy Inscrutable' was her real name?  Darke looks around for the obvious, then it seems to fail. He gets up and heads back into the mall to the nearby Hallmark card store...  Darke comes back in and settles in the back of the place. He begins to fill out an assortment of cards - Mother's Day, Valentine's, Birthday, etc. He seals each one and labels the outside with the same name.  A number of raver kids -- big pants, candy jewelry -- cluster around a table in front of the McDonalds. One of them, possibly the elder, grins over at the mall McDonalds' single apparent employee.  Daisy just scowls back.  Daisy sorts through the cards one by one, dragging her thumbnail along each seam to open the envelope. With each card, her expression of consternation grows deeper. "Really, now?", she asks. "Someone left all them cards all over the back table?"  Her deft fingers pluck out one at random. 'Happy 50th Anniversary!', the card cheerily declares.  "I dunno how they knew it was me an' Charlie's fiftieth," she adds.  Darke shrugs as he looks at the woman. "Maybe they were just being thorough.. shotgun approach or something like that." he points at the Happy Halloween card and the hand written inscription 'Do you dream?' "Looks like some of them are even personalized."  "Personalized," Daisy echoes. She thumbs open the Happy Halloween card, and she frowns. "And no. I don't dream, on account of I don't sleep."  She means it. The shadows underneath her eyes are deep and bruise-coloured.  Darke flips through the cards to the condolences card in the stack. Written inside is the phrase, 'I need the help of the dream speaker'. He slides he card over to you. "All or nothing time I guess."  Daisy's eyes narrow. Daisy's lips press together into a thin colourless line. Daisy's nostrils flare.   "Okay," she says, "rule number one that this is my day job, and you don't ask me about what I do at night while I'm at my day job. When I'm here, I'm just the girl what cleans the counter, dig? That's all I do."  The expression doesn't fade, though she adds: "I don't know you from Adam. You got ten seconds to explain why you're buggin' me here. Clock starts ... now."  Darke looks around, "There is something fucking with dreams, and I have only started to grasp the basics. I need a teacher... I was told you might be able to help. I was getting the run-around on the streets and would have tried to contact you at a social event, but I don't tolerate being jerked around."  "Riiiiight," Daisy says flatly. The expression fades from anger into trademark inscrutability. "I'll tell you what: I'll see what I can do, but I got to get together the entire College. There ain't no way I'm gonna do freelancing without my homies."  Darke nods a bit as he looks around. "On the streets, I go by Grave Robber. Next time we meet, you can call the place and time. I am looking to either earn your trust, or hire you outright. You and the rest of your homies can talk it through, just don't leave me hanging. if you are not interested, let me know as well. Lives are in the balance."  "Dig," Daisy repeats, rubbing at the corner of her mouth with her thumb. "We'll see what we can do."  Darke nods a bit. "Works for me..."  "I'm daisy@junkho.org, if you've got a net connection," Daisy says, "and you can catch up to any of us at our parties. We got a roster of future map points on junkho, too."  Darke ahs and nods. "I wander the digital world under the name Prometheus. prometheus@maildump.com. Send it there and I wil catch it in transit"  Daisy bobs her head sharply, perhaps in affirmation, perhaps because she's falling asleep.  Darke slides his coat on "Hope to hear from you soon." is all he offers before he pulls the cliche arcane-induced vanishing into the crowd stunt

      Side Street       Buildings line the street on both sides. It seems this is a mix of commercial and residential zoning. There are a couple of cars that bring to term the word heaps along the side street. The average clean cut useful member of society would be scared to enter this area. That especially holds true if there were a group of young punks hanging out by their vehicle smoking pot and drinking cheap booze. What are those two doing at the end of the street? Was that the sound of glass breaking? Perhaps it is best not to linger too long in this wasteland. The thought that the Mayor was right, Urban Blight needs to be halted, comes to mind.   Contents: Eddie Obvious exits: Basketball Court   Cross Street   Large Door     So it's the afternoon and there's these kids out in the street.  It's warm and pleasant - they're talkin'trash and rolling down the street with a graffitied basketball. It makes that hollow noise echoing off the walls of the nearby tenaments. On the steps of one of those buildings, Penny's leaning into the afternoon. The building isn't important, is generic, is always  falling apart; has overflowing metal garbage cans and rats moving in and out of the shade. A cigarette, unlit, rests in the fleshy part of her thumb - a balancing act. She's casual, slouched, has the look of the perpetually stoned; half-lidded and loose-limbed. Doesn't mind the locals and they don't seem to mind her.  A new games for the kids, offered by a gold toothed interloper. But no one's playing it seems. Either the younglings' about are too young this brand of chance, or they've got street smarts enough to smell a hook. Fortunately, there's always a sucker in the bunch. No matter how small the street traffic, no matter how savvy the audience, there's always someone who thinks they can  beat the game.   When Eddie comes to a halt a building over; he's found such a mook. He's young, black, and cocky. But he's got time to learn. The cards are simple playing cards, shuffled with a shark's touch. Eddie sets up on top of a small newspaper dispenser. It's flat enough to run the grift. "Ees called, find da' queen, right." And her highness is offered up for inspection in her red hearted glory. The boy nods, sure he can finger her amongst the other two cards.  Penny knows it when she sees it. Can mark the marker in the blink of an eye. From her slouch, that particular vantage ponit between the twisted iron slats, Penny watches the newcomer reel them in. His big show seems someting exciting and new. She gets up on a higher step, the concrete crumbling below even as she moves. She pockets the cigarette, pushing her sleeves up. But it isn't good enough, the view.  And those kids? They got goin'the minute their friend laid his money down. It's all "Bullshit" this and "You're gonna lose" that. But this kid, he's got confidence. Or dumb luck. Penny's just a step, a half. Then she's there staring over the tops of their heads at the game.  "Hi," her voice sending a shiver through the line-up so that they move, almost as one, turning then stepping back.  "How ju' doin." His accent's thick, and that was more of a statement than a question. Despite the momentary pause to pass on the pleasantries, Eddie's hands never stop handling the cards. The young black kid with his crooked 'Blue Jays' hat pays no heed to P. No, he's focused on her highness as she lays down with the other two cards. Then there's movement, fast fingers shuffling the three cards between three respective spots upon the newspaper dispenser. The Brazilian doesn't need to watch what he's doing; it's second nature to him. And besides, some white girl's talking to him out of the blue.   "Come on man, yer neva gonna win, yo." The kid's pals interject. But that doesn't phase the cocky street boy's intensity. Eddie finally looks down at the mark, hands still moving. "So den, hijo, jer gonna fin' de queen, right." She's flashed up from the middle position so the boy can get his bearings again. "No problem." He says confidently, placing his five spot on the make-shift table.  The kid's pals are so right about that. He'll never win. Poor and stupid are bad odds. He's the kind of kid that'll play chicken in a shitty car down a blind alley in a few years. He'll never even see that dumpster coming. He's the kind that doesn't take advice; not even from a white girl when she says "Don't you have a tournament to practice for?" Just like the poster says. King of the Courts. April 5.  "Yeah c'mon man," one shoves. "Yeah yeah, let's go already." "Man," the third complains "this shit's old."  But they don't really move. Hard to walk away from five-maybe-ten dollars in the middle of the day. Penny still hovers, glancing from time to time from Eddie's hands to his face. She's got a look on her face while no one's paying attention to her. Like she's asking a favor. Just don't.  //.etro: Penny rolls "3" privately to Eddie at diff 5.          For a total of 1 success(es).  Dumb AND lucky.  Penny moves up again, positioning herself between the kid, his money and the game. Now that she and Eddie are facing him, he starts to tilt his head a little. He starts to lose his cool, confident intensity "Nah man that ain't right," eyeballing your jacket and hair. Your teeth and tats. He backs off with his friends catcalling "Told you man, told you." He starts to make a grab for his money. But it's already in Penny's hand. She holds it up and back, has the height advantage. "You fuck off out of here right now and stop shitting your mother's dope money away, hey?" She chucks the balled-up bill and watches him go running.  Far from satisfied, Penny profiles, lip curled "Don't they teach you not to shit where you eat?"  Golden smile turned to neutral watch. The boy's are out of sight, more important now is the girl who fucked his grift. But the cards don't stop, even though the mark's been run off. Maybe a nervous habit. Eddie keeps shuffling.   "Da' was dinner money ju' jus spooked." *flap, flip, flap,* Fingers work the trio. The queen remains hidden under cover, and Eddie's mood runs sour. He wants to see what's next, he wants to recoup that five spot, and his stomach audibly wants some McNuggets. But he's not letting on like he's sniffed her yet. Nothin' in his body language shows his hand. Dude's got one helluva poker face.  "Josiah Michael Stevens isn't your meal ticket" Penny watches the cards. Flip flip, tick tick, stab. Her thumb interrupts the flow, the pink of her nail going white with pressure of her frame behind it. Speaking from the pencil-thin lines, her mouth and eyes transformed, possessive "He's mine."  She stands there still wanting to make something of it but her eyes are a give-away, red and veiny. All bark and no bite, clearly not at the moment. She steps back and swipes at her nose "So."  So, some foreign language. "Olhe a menina, mim no sabem que tipo do modelo voc pensa que eu sou, mas eu vi o que voc apenas l. E eu no penso que engraado... ou atrativo." Whatever that means.   The card's flipped over, Penny isn't a winner. But she shoudn't feel bad, like he says. "Don' feel bad, hija." See. Eddie holds up the King of Diamonds. "Nobody wins when I play. But ju'... ju' owe Eddie a cheesburger, eh." (In Portuguese "Look girl, I don't know what kind of idiot you think I am, but I saw what you just did there. And I don't think it's funny... or cute.)  You say "How about we call it even and you go make chumps of the tourists," nodding up the block during the departure from the english language, coming back around with "y'know that way, Eddie." The name spoken like a taunt. Whatever you said it didn't register on her radar of things to get offended by and she's on a tear all  her own.  "I got a business here, shit" all pissed off "and you think you can just stealth your way in? What the fuck?"  "Business? Dat what ju' call fuckin' with those kids lil' brains, eh?" A glance towards their departing forms. With a single swipe, he's plucked up the trio and returned them to random slots in his deck. That get's lost in his valet's uniform, and patted with his grimy fingers. Somewhere a nail-clipper is missing him. Eddie's working on one hell of a coke pinky. Planting both hands on the newspaper dispenser, he leans in to speak real quiet like.   "Next time ju' fuck with Voodoo Duarte's game, ju be nice about it hija." Having said his piece, the dark dude backs and preps to bail.  Penny, too, leans in real close like and slides her hands up on the empty newspaper stand, grabs the trailing hand. Presses something into it. Smallish. Dime-ish "I know who you are," she grins white and wide "I just wanted to see for myself if it was true."  As she walks off into traffic you can hear her say "He talks about you in his sleep all the time."

      You walk north along Parliament to Wellesley. Downtown - Parliament and Wellesley E(#179RJ)       Sitting on the edge of Cabbagetown, the homes here are nearly as old as those just south of here. However, the residents themselves are a little poorer. The old townhouses crunch together along the street, their dark-brown paint jobs chipping away to reveal the weakening wooden panels beneath. One-way streets become the norm here as well, creating no end of traffic problems. Residents park on the roadside since the homes here rarely have driveways. Small variety stores, grocery stores, hair-care salons and restaurants are all common here, all within easy walking distance of the residents of this area. With clean sidewalks, freshly paved roads and the newly added plants to create a comfortable air.  Contents: Clairance Obvious exits: Corso's Books   The Dubliner Pub  //.etro: It is 03:37 am, the dead of night, on Saturday the 18. day of April, 2009.  Clairance is making his routine rounds along the street. The townhouses here need little police attention, of course, but the officer is eager to spot any trouble that may revolve in or around the local pub. Clairance walks with his hands clasped behind his back, his green eyes constantly surveying and scanning the area as he walks. His pace is ginger and not filled with haste, although it could not well be described as 'leisurely' either -- an average pace.  Clairance read your description.  And so little in the way of pedestrian traffic that Penny is as evident, and just about as useless, as tits on a bull in a china shop. She's loud and .. well just loud. Singing at the top of her lungs, her head enlarged by mammoth headphones, the cord dangling and looping from neck to knee. Crossing the street she narrowly avoids getting hit by a crawling cab just outside the Dubliner. The cabbie doesn't get out to check on her - just picks up his fare and moves out, business as usual. Her singing gets a little lower around a smaller crowd of university drunks, mouth moving most likely out of sync with the track. She hun-huns a few words and bursts out again somewhere around the chorus.  The officer of the law, Clairance, doesn't seem amused in the least by this. Checking the time on his watch, he then takes a healthy stride over to where the girl -- not far from his age, anyway -- is walking. Making note of the various University students in the area, he takes the moment to gently tap the girl on the shoulder and motion above his own head for her to remove the headphones. Clearing his throat, he waits for the other to comply. "Ahem." The rookie cop seems a bit nervous as his eyes glance here and there, but this should be something he can handle easily.  There is a rustle, and the sound of footsteps as Micah steps out from the shadows... Micah has arrived.  Micah steps out from a little gaggle of folks hanging out infront of the Dubliner, he pats one of them on the shoulder and says "Thanks man..." before walking down the street, smiling.  Those other kids clear the area; cops at this hour are all business. Business they don't need, want and fear writing home about. Those kids couldn't make bail if they sold themselves. Penny, however. Let's call her reckless. Drunk and disorderly. Blissfully unaware or maybe she's just numb. Whatever the reason, she doesn't feel Clairance's cattle-prodding finger, goes on bobbing her head, starting intently at the traffic light or cross signals.  Unseen beyond the Shroud by the majority of Quick, Flay stalks along behind Penny. Looking bemused by her antics and sucking the blissful vibes trailing behind her. His face darkens and his lips curl in to a sneer as the Officer approaches.  The police officer taps Penny on the shoulder once more, a bit of a frown forming over his features. He may go as far as to grip her upon the shoulder, but not quite yet -- unless she doesn't respond, of course.  Micah strolls across the street, jaywalking. He dances through the traffic rather gracefully, comming on over to observe the Constable and the Citizin interacting. Micah is a devout Libertarian, and he would hate to see any abuses of power.  Penny jumps and whips her body around, right forearm first. They teach this sort of thing at civic centers. Put out a good strong elbow/arm and it's possible you won't get mugged. Maybe she's that side of drunk, which is why she misses and looks surprised, caught in a stumble. Turning head then shoulders and pivoting fully, Penny's other hand wrenches the headphones off her ears. With eyes half-closed she bellows "HEY why don't you watchwhoyou'rebumpin inna! Goddamn don't be all touchin'an" It's possible to sense the eye's focus through the conduit of the voice as she slows. Slower. Staring at Clairance, she mouths 'oh shit' and backs away a few steps. Lucky for her there's no oncoming traffic.  The police officer offers a bit of a smile, nodding his head at the obviously preoccupied and perhaps otherwise... engaged... woman. "Ahem. Ma'am, I think there's a slight problem here... you see, the hour is rather unfashionable for the loud noise you were creating. So, I'll have to ask you to not be quite so loud in this area... and, are you alright? If you need to get home safely... perhaps due to partying a bit much... we can arrange that for you. Don't want to see anyone getting hurt.." He clears his throat, stepping out of the way of traffic and speaking to the lady in a polite tone.  OOC> Micah says "crap i gotta go...sorry..." Micah escapes OOC.  Wide-eyed, Penny blusters "It's perfectly appropriate! I'm GOING to a FUNERAL" red in the cheek, red in the eye - it's probably true. Granted being drunk and singing dirges isn't the most obvious way of representing - generally and traditionally it's all black clothes, black armbands, black limos and a cachet of flowers to rival any wedding.  Penny has none of these things. She has a discman, maybe an open container and a head full of steam "I'm Fine, I'm just going" a scowl creeping past her lips and into the curve of her shoulders "going to a funeral okay so just go shove a bum offa bench o ..er..or something.."  The dead have very few liberties, and thus few libritarians. Flay has a chip on his corpus when it comes to people in uniforms, 'The Man' so to speak. Seeing the growing confrontation starting to form between this nights entertainment and the bastion of the status quo he moves between them. Of cource being incoporeal and trapped beyond a veil of disbelife it would not seem to do anyone any good.  "Oh." The officer takes a step back, nodding his head at that for a moment. "I see. Well, do you need a ride or perhaps an escort? And could I still ask you to keep the noise down, mm? I am sorry for your loss, but we still have our laws I am afraid..." He nods his head at that, confident in his approach.  Penny looks up and down the block. There. There's the cruiser. Spotting it's location, Penny makes sure her destination is in the opposite direction. This? is obvious. She was walking right for it about a minute ago while she was busy singing and waking up the neighborhood. Still she carries on at an indecent decible, possibly on her way to eleven "Oh yeah, right! We chat," elongating vowels and biting off the ends of phrase "you put your arm around me, then ease out your cuffs, shove me in the backseat and I WIND UP IN PRISON and MISS the FUNERAL. Yeah right you're sorry, you're sorry.. yeah you're sorry.." hiccupping in the middle, grief interrupted "you're sooo sorry baby.." She covers her mouth and turns, leans on the nearest thing; the hood of an old plymouth and casually vomits into the space between its tires and the curb.  "I don't have any desire to arrest you, honestly. I'm about your age, and I understand how these sorts of things happen... now, where is the funeral? I'd be happy to take you there. Unfortunately, you're not really in a state to go there yourself... you could hurt yourself, or somebody else." He says with an authoritative nod, clasping his hands behind his back and offering a weak smile.  Flay reaches forward and waves a gloved hand over Clairances eyes... all unseen by the living officer and his perspective chargee.  //.etro: Flay rolls "charisma+pandemonium" at diff 7          For a total of 3 success(es) including 2 ten(s). OOC> Clairance says "Eep. What happens?" OOC> Flay says "Lemme explain." OOC> Flay says "You're experiancing a momentary hallucination. Will only last a second, but will seem real. I'll @pemit the exact results." OOC> Clairance nogs.  Penny retches, dry heaves and shrugs off Clairance's hand. She flinches, presses herself forward to the car and twists away. "Told you to lemme'lone man," spittle dropping off her chin in a long spidery vein. "JESus mary and joseph," stubbing her toe on a garbage can, she doesn't seem to notice "you can't go where I'm goin'and anyway you got no" her tone of voice angrier, swallowing whole truckloads of bile (both real and imagined) "BUSiness at a FUNEral for a body you never met so just fuck.off.and.die."  "Oh, shit!" The rookie cop is immediately on his radio and running in the direction of the shots, quick to pull his own weapon and begin an impromptu investigation.  Watching the pig in uniform scurry off in pursuit of the wyld with a smug grin, Flay wispers across the Shroud to Penny, "Better get going chick, he won't be gone long." and turns and slinks off into the night having taken his fill.

      Pandora's Box - Pool Hall       The ceiling is set high with churning metal fans. The blades churn a thick  haze of smoke from cheap cigars and the pungent aroma of sweat mixed with stale  spilt beer. The bar runs the length of the far wall much like a saloon in an old  western. A polished brass foot-rail gleams in the fading light of the occasional  dropped match and guttering cigarette butt.       Many of the patrons watch each other with looks of a cautious calculation. Not  only are those opposite the pool table viewed with suspicion, but also the few one  might mistake as a friend. A darkness of nefarious deed reigns within the shadows  as the lighting illuminates from the mouth down. It is as though the dark conspires  to hide the intent deep within the eyes from the light of revelation. Then again  the windows to these souls only come up black.                                   NIGHTZONE                                                            --> Places and view enabled.   Contents: Eddie   Penny's all alone at the bar. Backlit by the jukebox, her jacket turns different  colors; blue, muddy yellow, bright orange. Everyone else seems to be enjoying their  night. peoplecleaning up at the tables, getting decent service (lip, drink and  otherwise) but not Penny. Surrounding her, a cloud of smoke and another imagined  somewhere above. The hangdog expression does a lot to explain things as do the  number of empty shot glasses lined up in front of her.  This is a long night and these are necessary evils.  Eddie walks in, he does. Counting bills already like a gremlin. Hunger forcing him  to participate in small games with small people. Perhaps not the best night scope a  joint for local suckers, given the scarcity of actual pool playing going down in this pool hall. No cocky green studs with their own sticks. Those are the easiest. Those are the ones that'd jump to throw a game Voodoo's way. Some brown dude with a stolen outfit, underfed, and dirty. Comin' in off the streets to step into a white  man's game. They'd pounce.   But they're not here tonight. So Eddie allows his gaze to drift once this is noted.   Penny shifts on the stool and the headphones looped and hanging off its back follow  gravity, slithering into a loose pile of wire and plastic on the poolhall floor.  Mingling with cigarette butts, spilled beer and the glint of canadian pennies, the  headphones tilt and open flat, kicked underfoot by someone else drunker than Penny. Drunk enough not to notice the loss or the molded pieces of plastic cracking under the pressure of a rough and stumbling foot.  She's busy, damnit. Penny is busy making a dent in their worst whiskey. Bottom of  the barrel, rot gut, acid breath. In her left hand she has poised the next shot.  Wet, dirty and possibly ashed in,her hand is listless. A boney trap of spindly long  fingers and in her right is a cigarette. Unlit.  Over to the overworked. Eddie steps to the plate, stuffing away funny colored  money. The bright pinks and reds associated with far off places. Mainly because  there's no fish in the sea tonight, he won't need the shiny lure. A moment to look  presentable as he switches over from business to one of the few remaining lords of  leisure. Dude does that thing with the licking, and his first and last finger, and  the running them over his eyebrows in different directions.   "Hija." Eddie pretends he's not quite sure it's Penny, that girl that fucked his  game. One hand holds the lapel of his jacket in place when he leans over her at the  bar. Scavenger inspecting a bit of luck.  Oh yeah, that's all you. Slick and even. And Penny? She's all tough jawed, determined. Girl's on a mission; a kind of localized vietnam; wandering through the foreign jungles of a deep, deep alcoholic persuasion. Was that a hiccup or a hello - hard to determine under the whinging of certain other elements in the thinly populated bar tonight - a younger, irresponsible crowd. They type that are always 'on something,' always paying too much for entertainment, getting ripped off by the strung-out waitress and wondering in a passive way what exactly happened to a grand in a night.  Yes, the noise peaks and coughs. Sounds that span the room before they drift down to a bass and acceptable treble. And her hand has barely moved; elbows on the bar, liquid rolling into the fleshy white space between her thumb and forefinger. "Hnn," unable to make her mouth do the talking.  "Ju lookeen..." Well, she looks like shit. "Excellente." Slime. He'd say that to anything. Eddie smiles through the layers of grease that coat his soul. 'There's  somethin' up', you'd be thinkin'. "Can I seet weet ju'?" Fingers uncoil towards the  stool over, one between the prospective bar mates. For good measure. It's all  polite, his approach. Designed specifically for an affirmative or agreeable reply  of sorts. To get him in the door. To get him closer to your paper.  Penny wraps her fingers down around the shotglass. The motion bringing to mind two very specific gestures: the first - a pitcher looking for the sweet spot on the ball and the second - combat oriented reloading, middle and index fingers finding the bottom of the glass. The middle and index tip-shoving the glass into place at the precipice of her lip. She drops her head back and makes it quick, the reflex flinch almost entirely absent - possible she's done enough she's not tasting it.  Setting down the glass to the bar Penny swipes those same two fingers across her shirt, left to right, slurring something in a vague and breakable english "Y'c'gme a li, yah."  At some point, Hiro -- a beacon of pure, shining light amidst the darkness of dark  deeds and dark thoughts ... no. Scratch that. He's just dressed like some kind of  fairy, and is wearing one of those queer temple headlamps. Regardless, he  materializes at Penny's elbow; flicking the goddamn lamp off when he notices the  brooding patrons fixing him with their steely, opaque soul-windows. Which is good,  because the illumination -- once one is accustomed to the oozing inky blackness of  darkville -- was nearly blinding.         "'ey, Pensy," he prompts.  "Como que no." The approach; worked as intended. Hannibal loves it when a job comes together. Eddie has been granted parlay, an audience with drunk party chic. A shiny loafer swings over the seat; dude plants his flag and goes for some matches. Matches with two sticks left, only one in working order. With a bit of luck, he doesn't need the second one anyways. Luck is his venue. Fire for Penny.   Boyo sits a seat over from her, allowing the stool between to act as the platonic  friend pillow guard in a sleepover. Eddie leans over to hand off the burning match.  On that side of the hall are the normal intricacies of the human condition. The simple drink, smoke and flirtation; a casual night out for a Canadian. And like those that traffic in weather and good tidings, they - Penny and Eddie and Hiro together perhaps - seem to exist on the other side of the screen. A strangeness pervades but doesn't move beyond them; the way she drinks is to excess, the way she smokes is indecent - the way she leans across the stool for the light with her whole body, a tattooed arm extended across to even out the keel, the cut of her hair falling off her face, off her wet cheek; an accident - an envelope full of glitter opening. Even the way she bends backward into Hiro before she's fully aware he's there.       "Rosy hm, this is my friennnnd" leaving an opening for an introduction.  Hiro scrubs the back of his hand across his nose, sniffing once, and offers it to  Eddie over Penny's shoulder. "'ey, whatsit," he murmurs, snapping his fingers - as  if to indicate a handshake should be immediate. He comes across as agitated and  nervous and paranoid and full of confidence - a chemical cocktail riding the horse  in place of a personality. "'s Hiro."  A gross whistling noise as Eddie's tongue sucks out the remains of his cheap dinner  from between incisors. Eddie's attention shifts to the colored pig.  The handshakes offered up, even if it forces Voodoo to touch the puerco sooner than he intended. His pace is a tad slower; his words end up waiting till all other actions  are accomplished. "How ju' doeen', 'm Eddie homes." Mexicans slaughtered his native accent in lockdown.  All hands where she can see them, Penny's eyes drift toward the bartender. The way he looks back at her says a couple of things about the place; they don't cut you off here. And they especially don't cut you off if you've got friends. Having a five second quiet moment Penny's eyes drift toward her navel, swung out and leaning half on Hiro, half on the barstool. "Same?" even as she nods yes, already with the bottle in hand, he starts refilling the shot glasses in front of her. No sense in dirtying up new ones but then she asides to the bartender "Cup'l fer these two." New glasses afterall. Lowball - they're all out of the tiny tumblers. Lazy, Penny drags and exhales across Hiro's head, working out the numbness from her tongue "Almost godlike, habatcho?"  Hiro's hand clasps, shifts, snaps off the fingertips. He rocks back on his heels as  he extracts the digit; wedging it back into his labcoat pocket. Not much movement;  just this perpetual slouch that forces him to address Eddie around -- no, more  eclipsed by -- Penny. He tilts his head to the side, regarding the lush sidelong.  "Tuesday, huh?"  Settling back into the counter, the valet. Perceptive. Inside words. Whatever they  mean. Eddie will watch for a moment, using his decoder ring went needed. Tuesday  bit, foreign. The brown man isn't hip. This allows for a brief inventory check. Pat  the jacket, bundle's there. Pat the front pant-leg pocket, keys. Taking stock. Dude  finally reaches out for the bar pretzels as gnaws on a few.  Penny finds it funny, smiles when Hiro says it. She snifs like maybe she needs to blow her nose and bobs her head back and forth; some variation of yes. When she opens her mouth to speak again, Penny already has the next shot lined up.  "Was supposed to go to this funeral with Days. Plan was we get medicated," pointing this out for Eddie's edification "you can never last through those things, all those handshakes" emphasizing the word on its first syllable - /hand/, flickflicking an ash down by her knee, somewhere in the dark between the bar and Hiro's thigh "but she never came to get me so I figured," talking mostly to Hiro's orbiting head "why not stay? Chin chin old chap" annunciating tight-lipped in a laughable east-ender accent, Penny snatches a shot and knocks it down.  A hand manifests, bearing one of Daisy's cheap GPCs, and Hiro plucks Penny's  cigarette from between her fingers, using it to light his own. "Ms. A," he states,  rather than asks. He knows which funeral. "The pig said I shouldn't go." The  cigarette is offered for Penny's retrieval. "Guess I won't. He said she was  watching me." He makes a scissor-cutting motion with index and middle fingers;  snaps again. "Like she wanted to do that. Girl was crazy. Loved her, but she was  crazy."  By this time i'd assume the other two drinks P ordered had arrived. That's a  novelty, relative strangers aiding in one's inebriation. Eddie seems quite pleased  to accept the fire water when it arrives, greeting the drink with one cheeked  puffed with munched pretzels. A few remain untouched in the palm of his hand. "Very nice." Nods, he's pleasant and giving thanks despite talk of corpses. A sip to  punctuate his approval of shit whiskeys.  "That pig has a point," infering something like agreement in a low voice, fingers held still to receive the cigarette again. The bartender approaches, murmuring "My shifts's over," hedging for a tip "so maybe you wanna close out your tab?" Penny nods a little, sure-suring him but makes no moves to reach for a wallet or anything that looks like she's pulling money out. Just nods her head and lips the cigarette, continuing when he backs off "besides they /all/ are, take Jesse" for example, she implies, clipping her words "disappears for months at a time doing stuff we can't exactly y'know, talk'bout with the PTA." Penny waves her cigarette around, pontificating and rolling her eyes. Unsteady. "I mean and they want us to act surprised.. stunned... amazed? Uh uh."  Maybe it's the hour and maybe she has a bullseye on her somewhere - some invisible 'tag' sign on her back; whatever it is, it's attracting all the wrong attention and suddenly there's some acne-faced kid standing there. Wall-eyed and grinning like he's at the spring formal getting up the nerve to ask her something. Did he think she was gesturing at him? Lidded, Penny pulls herself together and rasps "What?"  "Thought maybe we could y'know, dance."  There's other people way in the back - they're "dancing" too; a few couples crushed into eachother in the dark. She reeks but Penny is nothing if not indulgent. She spins off the stool and winks broadly over her shoulder at Hiro, leaving him to get chummy with Eddie for a few. Call it a sixth sense but there's a hundred and ten percent chance she'll have the money to cover the tab and then some by the time she gets back.  Bacon and whiskey, fine company. Even if Hiro isn't a white chic. The awkward  silence of two people left at the bar together ensues. Nether know each other for  shit. Friends of friends and that. Not that he knows Penny at all ether.   Eddie looks over to Hiro. A sip of cheap booze fills the void between them. "Pal a  jers get dead recently?" There's a curious starting point.

      Here's the log. It's missing a pose from me, I think, near the beginning. Pardon the bad posing and etc. We really had to rush it cuz I had to bail soon :P  You enter the shop.  Queen of Wands - Main Shop(#6966RlJ) 	This shop seems to fall somewhere in between small and large in the scale of size, though it can be hard to get a feel for just how big, or small, it actually is. The layout is a bit haphazard, with little twists and turns created by the setup of the shelves, resulting in little nooks in unexpected places. Upon these shelves is a variety of wares to suit the pagan shopper. Near the front is a selection of jewelry, as well as some of the higher priced ritual equipment, such as wands and athames, all kept behind a locked glass counter. Lining the walls are myriad shelves containing books, organized into sections such as 'Goddess Worship', 'Celtic', 'Psychic Arts', 'Divination' and 'Native Arts'. The books range in quality from the serious, to obvious fluff.. something to suit all tastes. There are the old standbys such as 'Dancing the Circle' and 'Drawing Down The Moon', as well as your usual horde of Llewellyn books. The rest of the shelves contain what seems to be a constantly changing selection of goods, though things such as tarot decks, stones, herbs, and candles are a constant ware. The air within the shop is constantly scented with mild incense, and music plays in the background, often music over the sound of waterfalls or rain. In the back is a door, with a sign posted listing times when psychic readings and holistic medicinal services are available. 	The shop is lit with discreetly placed track lighting, with the addition of tiny white bulbs dotting the ceiling. If one knows anything about astronomy, it's easy to tell that the stars are in the form of the constellations, and is very well done, with everything in it's proper place. Looking out the plate glass window that overlooks the street, you see it's clear, cool, and breezy..  Contents: Jake Daisy  //.etro: Escalus will be joining your location. Escalus has arrived.  The warning bell rings a good three seconds before Jake pushes open the door and walks in, closely followed by Hiro, it appears.  Cadence enters from the street. Cadence has arrived.  Suddenly, one of Hiro's phone rings.   Escalus says "phones."  Hiro was loitering outside; now, suddenly, he is inside - having slipped in alongside Jake. "Yo," he grunts-more-than-says; swinging his courier bag around to rifle through the interior. He comes up with a cheap, blocky cellphone -- the prepaid variety that doesn't require credit checks, background checks, or using your real name. "Yoallo?" he asks, thumbing 'ok' and lifting the phone to his ear. >> "Hello? Hello? Please don't hang up. My name is Dana Acheson."  Cadence heads into the shop, expecting few if any people around. She carries a book and newspapers under one arm, her backpack over her shoulders. From long habit she turns toward the front counter and starts that way before even looking around. She stops short, just before almost running over Jake and Hiro ahead of her. "Whoa."  To Daisy, the activity she's participating in right now -- leaning sullenly against a wall, aviator sunglasses pushed up to blot out every last photon, is 'hanging out'. To local storeowners and the municipal police, this activity is called 'illegal loitering'.  "...yeah, right, who gave you this number, huh?" Hiro asks his phone, twisting in place to eye Cadence sidelong. He steps aside, expression irritable -- as if Cadence has no right to be here -- and slouches over alongside Daisy.  Jake pulls his sunglasses down to the end of his nose and looks over them as he walks around towards the back of the store. When Cadence comes in, he turns and smiles, "Cade... how you doing?"  >> "Dr. Maximillian Ravenhurst told me I should get in touch with you, but I find the number by . . . adjustment."  Cadence gives Hiro an amused glace as she continues on her way to the counter setting her things down on the edge before hopping up onto her favorite seat. She grins over at Jake, "Good to see you! I see you've found a new sense of style."  Hiro tilts the phone aside, mouthing 'Ravenhurst' in Daisy's direction; expression quizzical. The mic maneuvers back into place. "Yeah, you looking for Peachy K or sommat? I got his number, but he's been kinda busy.."  Daisy doesn't flinch at Hiro's telephone conversation -- -- but you can see the tendons in her neck vibrate with anxiety, and a wave of tension pass across her shoulders, across her back, and down her arms, where it's finally released in a wave of antsy knuckle-cracking. This is not a girl who deals well with unexpected circumstances.  >> "I am looking for Mr. Keene or his colleagues. I need to talk to one of them."  Jake notices no tendons as he walks back over to Cadence, "Huh?" He looks down at himself, "Oh. Ted recommended it. It covered up the vest nicely." He looks up, "Something about a red pill and following a white rabbit. I didn't quite follow him. But this is apparently very universal if you need to more around alot.  Cadence smiles at him, nodding. "It works," she agrees. She keeps her voice down so as not to disturb Hiro's phone conversation across the room, idling swinging one leg back and forth in her position on the countertop. "You're getting to be buddies with Ted, then?"  "...yeah well you got his colleague. This' Stice." Hiro's voice remains super-cool. His expression has waned into outright panic. "Is there uh something I can help you with?"  Jake shrugs, "I... honestly don't know. Ever get the feeling everything you knew was wrong?"  >> "Yes. Would you care to meet me? I know you have no reason to trust me, but I can only say that . . . there are important things than this war."  Cadence nods to Jake. "All the time," she murmurs to him softly. "It's a horrible feeling." she offers Jake her hand, but her attention has now strayed to Hiro and his terrified phone conversation.  "Dude," the young punk girl stage-whispers, peering at Hiro over the gold frames of her aviator glasses, "use your ... whazzitcalled ... craft name. They eat that shit up. And ask him about my petition."  "Yeah well considering I've never heard your name before, yeah." Paradoxically, Hiro abrubtly seems significantly calmer. He isn't in trouble. "I'll meet you somewhere. Is there some kind of problem or summat? You got my attention with the name-dropping, but..."  Hiro hits mute. "Ain' him. Some dude," he tells Daisy, thumbing the button a second time.  >> "You can certainly say there is a problem. There is a wrong that must be righted."  Jake leans against the counter, "I'm trying to figure out what's the truth of the matter... and the deeper I look, the worse it looks." He sighs.  "I know," Cadence agrees quietly. "I had half hoped you wouldn't look. I enjoyed your optimism."  "Yeah well no specifics onna phone, right? Where an' when?" Hiro asks the phone, gesturing at Daisy for a cigarette.  Jake nods a bit, "Optimism based on lies does not a good reality make, I'm afraid."  Cadence half watches Hiro and Daisy out of the corner of her eye, but replies to Jake, "I know. I should have spoken with you about it more. I apologize."  GPCs, a crushed pack, emerge from the pocket of her pants. Daisy offers the entire thing to Hiro, and doesn't take one herself. Her expression is a perfect mirror of Hiro's.  >> "I am the one asking, so I will let you set the tone. I'll be alone. None of my people will be there."  Jake makes a dismissive hand gesture to Cadence, "Oh, Pish Posh. You've done wonders for me."  Cadence insists, "I could have done more. I should have." She makes a face, and is silent a moment, but suddenly says, "I do have a little bit of good news. Some hope, I guess, or at least an idea."Hiro pins his phone between ear and shoulder, shaking out a cigarette. "I don't like the sound of that, man," he murmurs around the smoke fitted between his lips. The pack dissapears into a pocket; a flash of butane flares between cupped hands. "But you can find this, you can find me..." He trails off, voice dropping significantly in volume when he continues.  Jake perks up a bit, "Oh?"  Cadence leans in and whispers to Jake quietly, motioning with one hand toward the newspapers on the counter next to her.  >> "Actually, I cannot. I have no skill in spatial science; this is on purpose. I randomly dialed the right number."  You paged Escalus with 'There's a starbucks at the corner of ... in downtown Toronto. It's high-profile and public. We'll be there in five minutes. If you aren't, meeting's off. You seem like a lucky guy. Catch a lucky cab.'.  Jake nods to Cadence, "Well good for him!"  Daisy now thumbs at the corner of her mouth, disguising an expression that is rapidly becoming even sourer than Hiro's. A glance is cast back to Jake and Cadence, then back to Hiro again.  Cadence nods to Jake, "Exactly. Obvious, but good news. Feel like helping?"  "Come on, Daisy. We gotta go," murmurs Hiro, dropping the phone into his hand, and thumbing 'off'. He hooks a thumbnail into the phone's release, strips away the faceplate, battery, screen, extracts a chip from the center, and leans over the counter to deposit the mess of gutted phone into the trash bin. A flashed 'peace' in Cadence's direction, and he heads for the exit; bending the chip between his fingers to weaken the silicon.  Cadence waves to Hiro in reply.  Jake nods to cadence, "Certainly."  To Cadence, Daisy gives a single explicit instruction. "Burn that," she says flatly, turning to join Hiro on his way out. One hand brushes through her hair; the other grasps nervously at the laser pointer held in her center hoodie pocket.  You leave the shop.  [...] Travel through the city, to Starbucks - 2 blocks away [...]  The rich aroma from Starbucks draws you in.  Starbucks(#547RJM)      In the fashion of all Starbucks, this coffee house is styled after the Italian coffee bars where regulars sit at small table and booths and drink espresso with their friends. It provides a seductive atmosphere, sleek yet comfortable. The coffee preparers, known as 'baristas', Italian for bartender, are busy behind the counter preparing various caffeine filled beverages. The aroma of their creations teases your senses. The counter and the entire room feature plenty of burnished wood and brass. About the place sophisticated artwork hangs on the walls. The sound of soft-rock music can be heard over the continuous murmur of the patrons. Through the front window pedestrians can be seen, glancing back at you as the aroma coming through the front door distracts them.                          -- Places Available Here --   Obvious exits: Out     Daisy comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. Daisy has arrived.  Hiro tugs the door open, wedging it open with his elbow to allow Daisy to follow behind him. He drops a handful of some crumbly green substance -- some kind of broken plastic, perhaps -- in the trash next to the entrance; brushing his hands together as he surveys the place. "Next to the window," he instructs Daisy.  Jesse's invisble friend has tagged along on this Invisible outing. Although his contact to the skinlands is AWOL tonight, he couldn't resist tagging along as the chaos that follows is always entertaining.  "Better switch out all the phones," suggests Hiro's partner in crime, "just as soon as you can. Better do it another place, though, on account of paying in quarters twice might be a tad suspicious." The barrista is watching her suspiciously. Apparently, Daisy's past excursions to Starbucks have gone unsurprisingly badly.  At this time of the morning there is only one person in Starbucks. He's a sandy-haired business-suit wearing man wearing silver-rimmed round spectacles. He's got a John Lennon-y look to him.  They're a feeble disguise, those glasses are, but Daisy still pushes them up as she enters. Better to have a shield against prying eyes, satellites, and god-knows-what-else than to go naked. So, having just snorted a bump of powdered confidence from the hollow of her thumbnail, Daisy struts on across the Starbucks toward Lennon. "You the guy we're waiting for?", she asks.  "I am Dana Acheson, if that is the man you are looking for." He speaks calmly and clearly. "Thank you for meeting me like this. You are friends of Keene?"  Hiro, taking his own advice, seats himself by the window; turning his head to watch the interaction between Daisy and Mr. Lennon. He doesn't say anything further, merely slouching in his seat.  Acheson shifts a little bit in his seat. It is the only sign of his discomfort.  At your table D"My name's Daisy. Daisy Inscrutable. So don't bother lookin' it up, 'cause it's obviously ain't my real name."  Daisy smiles thinly. It's a carefully rationed expression, neither friendly nor unfriendly, neither open nor closed. "And yeah. We know Keene.""  At your table Acheson nods. "We have a saying in the Syndicate, Daisy. Everything's got a price. I need to find out what it will take for you and your friends to help me."  At your table Hiro's hands fidget beneath the table; fingers lacing and unlacing. Finally, a hand rises with a cigarette -- procured from a labcoat pocket -- which he fits between his lips. He doesn't light it. "You're talking. We're listening. Some things not even you can afford, man."  At your table Acheson places his hands flat on the table, a gesture much like poker players use to show that they are ready to begin. "I have already made quite an investment. I am meeting with you, without the Administrator of Toronto knowing about it. This could be construed as treason in some circles, even though it isn't. I need the help of your cabal . . . and just your cabal."  At your table Hiro keeps his eye on the street as he speaks, watching the occasional car cruise past outside. Probably on the lookout for black sedans. "You haven't said what you want, yet," he points out, quietly.  At your table Acheson says "It's usually not a good idea to lay all your cards on the table. This thing has the potential of blowing way the fuck out of proportion and taking a lot of people with it." He takes out his own cigarette case--silver--and pulls rather expensive cigarillos out of it. He takes the time to light his cigar. "I am still gauging you.""  At your table "You're playin' around, man." Hiro comes up with a cheap plastic bic; roasting the tip of his cigarette -- a cheap GPC -- to life. He makes no special effort to smoke it; letting it smoulder silently in the corner of his mouth. He seems adverse to eye contact - keeping his attention on the street. "What we're doing here could be construed as treason, no matter who's name you waved like a white flag. So we're traitors. We've been called worse, you're prolly a squeaky clean fucker. What do you want?"  At your table Acheson says "I want you to help me rid the world of a particularly vile contagion. We all do things that we are ashamed of, even organizations dedicated to the betterment of humanity like ours. This . . . thing . . . I need your help with, is one of the Union's darkest hours.""  Acheson taps his hand on the table, and you can hear the ring he is wearing clicking on it.  At your table and that, that gets Hiro's attention. He looks over; fixes his attention wordlessly on Acheson. "Don't spook on me, aiight?" Unzipped outside pocket on his courier bag -- now hanging at his side -- and he rifles for something.  Hiro unzips his bag, rooting through it, and comes up with a battered black tape recorder. He hits play and reverse; setting it on the edge of the table.  At your table Acheson says "How familiar are you with Bergen-Belsen?"  Acheson freezes as you put the tape recorded on the table. "/No/ recordings."  At your table "I ain't recording shit, man. Taking a precaution you should have taken, and I was too blasted to think of." A thumbnail edges up the volume; it's definitely playing, not recording. Some kind of backwards nonsense interspersed with a murmur of static. "Never heard of it. It's some front, I'm assuming."  At your table Powdered confidence has crossed the line into anxiety and from there into paranoia. The expression on her face is locked into isostasis, lips pressed tremblingly hard against each other. Both of her hands are locked around the laser pointer in her front pocket. "They buried something there," she says, "in a block of concrete, on account of it wouldn't die. The doctor who did it was Dutch something. Maybe from South Africa. It killed almost the entire unit before they put it down. It's still there. Eva told me about it.""  At your table Acheson says "Bergen-Belsen was a concentration camp during the Second World War. It was part of the Final Solution." He raises his eyebrows at Daisy's statement. "I do not know anything about that. I do know that the Construct located there hosted Dr. Rudolph Zauberman and his pet nightmare, Projekt Ubermensch.""  At your table "Yeah so maybe I wasn't paying attention during Hitler week in school." Hiro's cigarette tilts upwards, the cherry's tip flaring. Smoke leaks from his mouth. "So what happened?"  At your table Daisy bobs her head. Once. It's obviously forced, but it's the most she can muster.  At your table Acheson says "After the second world war, when those of us who were called on the carpet for profiting from that madman's reign, they slapped Zauberman on the wrist and sent him to Eden."  At your table Acheson says "You see, no matter how tainted the source data, Ubermensch had very promising results." Sarcasm is evident here. "And success, to some, is more important than ethics."  At your table "Don't you guys have internal people to deal with this kind of mess?" asks Hiro, ashing his cigarette off to one side.  At your table Acheson says "You mean the Men In White? Yes, we do. But whenever you have an organization, you have politics, and there are people on the Amalgam Prime willing to overlook where the Ubermensch Data came from as long as the project continued to produce. No Man In White will go against an Amalgam Prime Ruling." He takes a deep inhalation of his cigarillo. "But we are not all Men In White.""  At your table "Yeah, you aren't the only one with that kinda problem," deadpans Hiro, scrutinizing the tip of his cigarette. "So what happened? And why'd it hit Toronto?"  At your table Acheson says "We . . . our conspiracy, if you want to call it that . . . have managed to . . . terminate all the remaining research members of Projekt Ubermensch, including Dr. Zauberman. We've managed to destroy all the data, even that data stored in the Central Archive, which is no small feat. There is only one last instance of Ubermensch left--one last link before it is gone forever."  At your table Hiro says "Tell you the truth, man, this sounds like it's a little over our heads. But what is it? This have something to do with the crazy shit that hit the streets this week?"  At your table Acheson says "It isn't over your heads. It is right up your ally. We've tried three times to eliminate this last remaining piece, and we've failed three times. By now, FCA7-T and Palmerton must have figured out that it is an internal conspiracy. Therefore, the chance of us actually succeeding is virtually nil. However . . . they may not suspect an attack from a different direction."  At your table "We gotta speak with the others. You understand that. If you can give me a voicemail drop I can leave our decision at..." Hiro trails off, crushing his half-smoked GPC out on the table. "We won't turn it over, even if we decide to assist, you understand. If we find it -- and I think I have an idea what you're referring to -- we'll want to destroy it."  At your table Acheson inhales the smoke. "You cannot share this with the rest of the Traditions here. We have enough data--the Man In White in charge of Toronto keeps careful eyes on you people. We're willing to give you more information, if necessary, to get you to do this.  At your table "I mean -our- decision. Not their decision." Hiro pushes his chair back, getting to his feet. "We don't answer to the locals, man. They're a bunch of fuckin jerk-offs. We'll be in touch, right?"  Acheson says, "Sure. Here is my number. I'll be in town."

      It seems to take her a moment to register what you said, or perhaps she is just deciding upon how to address you. Simply enough, she smiles and lifts her hand to wave, just as you did. "Hello." Her hand lowers and she looks off to her right where a lone car is driving in the distance. "Why are you out here so early? It is early, yes?" Her dark gaze sweeps over to focus on your face. The distant car turns onto another street. (Peter is seated on a bench. Mel is standing before him.)  Peter nods quickly, and says, "Yeah, it's early." He doesn't really look away from the woman, now, even as she glances at that car. He hesitates before answering finally, resting his hands on the computer, "I wanted some fresh air. I just like being outside, really. And I couldn't sleep. What about you?"  Her eyes seem to lower further to examine his hands. She shrugs and smiles up at him. "The same. I could not sleep. I have that problem..." She pauses and closes her eyes, waving a finger in thought. Suddenly her eyes open. "Insomnia. I have that. Sometimes." Again she shrugs. "Are you learning something on your laptop?" She takes a sidestep to get a view, though it is closed. Perhaps she expects him to just open it and show her.  The city bus. Hooray for public transportation. It runs all day and night. Even those ungodly hours before 8 AM. Conveniently and strategically, bus benches are placed at most major intersection to service the fleet. This one says '360' on the front, featuring an add for the Energizer Bunny. With a noxious exhale, the smog spewing rectangle comes to a halt at the local bench. Zombified, Eddie steps off as its mechanical doors open. Maybe it's too early, maybe he stayed out all night, and maybe the headphones he wears are blaring too loud. Whatever the case, this brown fellow is in his own special 'zone'. The curb holds a steady footing, as green eyes seek out the nearest street signs. The bus pulls off and burps carbon-dioxide at him.  Peter glances up as the bus pulls up, frowning a little as he sees the smoke. He looks back to the woman, then, not seeming to get the hint to open the computer. He shakes his head, "I was just writing a letter to a friend, who lives up North."  Mel looks up, North, sort of. "Oh. Yes, well I write up North all the time." She does not seem too convincing, of course. With a little twirl of her dress, she does a turn to face the offending sight, smell and sound of the bus. Her hand fans before her nose and she makes a face. "Perhaps he is an... insomniac too," she tells Peter with a half-smile of discovery. She then turns back to face the boy on the bench. "Do your parents know that you go out when it is still dark?"  Synthetic thumps leak from orange puffy headphones. Hands in pockets, Eddie starts down southward having fingered his location from the green signs. Nodding to the beats, it's a good bet he'll be deaf by 40 if he doesn't lower the volume. But his march is halted by a red light. On the corner, his fingers trail up the side of a pole in a suggestive manner. He's working on one hell of a pinky coke nail. Glancing to the left and right, safety first, it's a priority. His pink tongue runs over 14 carrot teeth as he says something to himself in a Latin based language.  Peter glances to Eddie, and then grins back to Mel at her joke. He nods, "Maybe." Then, at the last question, he shakes his head a bit with a bit of a grin. "Not really, no. But, I might not look it, but I am old enough that it doesn't really matter."  Melantha reaches down and gathers up a bit of her dress on either side, likely to aid in walking without tripping over velvet and lace. The toes of her small boots tap as she peers down at what she has uncovered. "I will leave you to that letter," she tells Peter plainly, glancing up from her feet at him. "I am going to follow him now. He seems quite oblivious to the world. That makes me curious." She nods her head toward Eddie and smiles. Oh, a little adventure. Sure.  Red light blues. This is a long one. Built to accommodate heavy traffic from the east and west. And duly, less from the north and south. So it has Eddie waiting, see. It has him standing on the corner at 6 AM. Perfect time for mumbling. What sounds like song lyrics perhaps, muffled by the obscuring sound of the beats being poured into his inner ear.   "Eu estarei esperando aqui at que eu morro."  Peter glances again towards Eddie, curious an then up to Mel again. He nods a bit, and says, "Might be dangerous, you know. But good luck." He smiles again. He opens up his laptop once more, but doesn't start typing right away.  "I would not bother if it was not dangerous. I should not even be out here right now," Melantha states with a practiced grin that is reserved for little girls licking lollipops. She lifts her hand and waves to Peter then turns on her heel to start after Eddie. Stuck at the red light. It must be fate. A few clicks of her boots and she is soon beside him, rocking back and forth with a coy sway. Her ponytail flops around to her shoulder when she not-so-sublty turns to give him a sidelong glance.  Suspect. Dubious. Girls don't approach him. Eddie doesn't like that. Maybe Eddie doesn't like girls. Maybe Eddie doesn't like humans. Maybe Eddie doesn't like anything but his headphones. And she's looking at him now. Cool under fire, dude arches a brow. That's about when the blank red 'don't walk' sign turns green. Time to step off the curb and into harm's way.  Peter smiles again to what the woman says, and nods a bit. As she turns to walk after Eddie, his curiosity won't let him do anything but watch to see what happens. He stays sitting on the bench, though, hands poised as if ready to start typing as soon as his distraction is past.  Suspicion and Melantha seem to be bedfellows, so she takes the arched brow in stride and steps off of the curb in odd time with Eddie. If he does not step, neither does she, that is the rub. Mimicing is likely one of the faster ways to get one's ass handed to them, but that is her approach nonetheless. She is smiling to herself by now, happy to be annoying someone.  Then by the time they've reached the proverbial 'other side', Eddie's aware this isn't a chance encounter. Nothing but a flaming infant falling from the sky could make him run right now; it's too early for that kind of physical exertion. However, once aboard the next concrete curb, one of the puffy orange headphones' are removed from his ear. This of course will allow him to converse in an audible and effective manner.   "Wha' ju' wan'?" Eddie's accent is unmistakably Hispanic. His southward trek doesn't waver, no. If there's to be any sort of conversation here, it's to be a mobile one.  Looking quite equal to the task, Melantha follows, in time, step for step. To the question she gasps and points at your mouth, then covering hers as she laughs. "Is that gold on your teeth? That is amazing," she coos, leaning a bit closer, one finger pointing to your teeth while another rubs at her own teeth. "How did you do that?" She is invading your space now, nearly putting her fingers into your mouth. Like ferrets, she likes shiny things.  "Wha' da fuck..." Shooing hands swat Mel's fingers from Eddie's mouth. Attacking them like invading bees with stinging intents. His neck reflexively pulls back, bringing with them his gold capped wonders. He takes a few steps away, to put a gap between the pair longer than arm's length. "Get away from me, loca." That means 'crazy'. And his eyes seem convinced of the fact. "'S a matter whichu." That's not really a question. Still he walks.  The flailing limbs and smart remarks give her pause and she stops following. Her expression is not so much defeated or sad... no, it is something more along the lines of disappointed realization. The way one looks when told that their ex-lover is sleeping with their ex-best friend. She turns a little toward the morning traffic and tilts her long neck awkwardly to peer up at a streetlamp. The pour of unnatural light causes her to look ghastly pale.  That's noted. The pale bit. But whatever just invaded Eddie's morning walk, doesn't quite compute. Strange mimes reaching for his teeth in an early haze. Weird enough to write about perhaps, but too weird to stick around for. Like a sex crime, he backs from the scene. Wondering what just happened, who that was, and why him. After a suitable distance is placed between Mel and Eddie, and with the benefit of a few comforting glances over his shoulder to make sure this would be dental molester isn't hot on his trail, his headphones are replaced to their rightful position. Leaving in his wake, a trail of electronic emissions and curled lips.  The lamppost holds a fascination that cannot be explained - nor will it be. The molester does not follow. She does not even look after you, but somewhere in the depths of her mind, if she bothered to consider it, she would be quite pleased that she disturbed the intimdating male. Bizarre...

      Overdrives Alley - Main Bar(#6632RlJM)       This is the large, open main room of a rowdy biker bar. Near the entrance is a single bouncer who casually looks everyone over as they enter. On the far side of the room is a long, wooden bar with old, leather-covered bar stools in front of it. Behind the bar is a long mural of a naked woman, sprawled out on her side. The liquor selection here is fairly limited, but there's a wide selection of beers to choose from.      Around the room are wooden tables of varying sizes, surrounded by wooden bar chairs. Along the wall across from the bar are a few booths. In one corner, next to the bar, is a door marked 'Staff Only'. Opposite it, on the other side of the room, is a staircase leading up to a more private room. There are two old, battered pool tables to the right of the front door. They charge a loonie per play and have a limited selection of pool cues, none of which are in good condition. A juke-box sits next to a small dance floor that is rarely ever used for dancing.                               Places available                                                                NIGHTZONE                                        The street out front is visible through the only window in this room.  Contents: Akiko Tom Jesse Jake Amano Owen Luthor   Luthor finishes his final drink and stands, walking away from the bar. Luthor stands and leaves Long wooden bar.  Jesse looks back down the bar. "So, is Cade okay?" As though he hadn't just said that thing about the strapon. Back to whatever passes for dignity and composure to him. He yawns, rubs his face, grins faintly as the pills find their way through the brain/blood barrier. "Who was the guy?"  Owen merely sighs at the turmoil, apparently unmoved by the incident at the door. Looking both sullen and bored, he summons the barkeep to settle his bill. Apparently calling it a night, the large man rises from the bar...vacating a valuable seat in the over-crowded bar.   Amano's mental wince manifests in a half-swallowed yelp, spinning 'round to confront her. "Hey! That's not fair!" Too little, to late... He backs off a few steps towards the bar. Akiko Hops back onto a seat and grabs her drink sipping it for a long moment before turning to view the bar scene and look to see if anything changed.  Jake looks at Jesse a bit, "A few cuts, a few bruses... no idea who the guy was. the cops aren't saying anything on the matter. Except he apparently shot his own hand off. People today..."  Akiko Rolls her head in a streching manner looking extremly bored herself now as she looks about crossing her legs and letting the dangling leg bounce in time to music.  Tom continues to lean against the bar, not even looking up for 'shot his own hand off'; being a fair bit of a bore, actually, a really boring fellow. His jaw tenses... loosely untenses. He takes a break from looking thoughtful and intense - no doubt involved in formulating some kind of big creative breakthrough or whatever. But then again, maybe not. His eyes give him away: he can often be found brazenly gazing at Akiko, enjoying the view while he has it. In, you know, a purely... chaste. Anthropological-slash-artistic way. You know, like that. (pfft.)  Amano is all sulky and exausted after that random little oredeal, draping his arms upon the bar, laying his head there, and wondering over the freaks who rest nearby. He actually seems rather interested in the goings on, which is rather special of him. Rising from the bar, Owen makes his way through the rough crowd. Still, his size and foul demeanor grants him some personal space as he heads for the door. Brushing past the bouncer, he bids the man "Good evening" and disappears into the moon-lit night beyond. Penny drinks long, listening to the conversation but really more intent on those biker chicks. She's busy. Busy keeping them at arm's length with the occassional dirty look and brow lift. As if to tell them it's better on that side of the bar. That's not what she's here for, a bar fight. Penny doesn't have time for anything as low as fisticuffs with people; least of all people with helmet hair (she must only take on the pretty people, she looks like the kind of girl that may have been paid to mudwrestle.) No, a fight isn't her scene. No, the height of drama was between her and a feather and now? "Oi, freebie over here" a hand up wave-wave-waving backwards behind her at the bartender.  "Well, serves him right." Jesse shakes his head, tossing his artfully bobbed hair, and lights a new cigarette. "You think that Daddy Frank cat had anything to do with it?"  Luthor heads out to the street. Luthor has left.  Jake thinks for a bit then comments, "Who's Daddy Frank?" Jesse shrugs again, returning to his slow, gloved scratching at the length of his arm. "Dunno. His name came up in conversation a couple times. Thought he was the competition."  Daisy comes in from the street. Daisy has arrived. Penny laughs, catching that "What, you're saying there's only room in this town for one kinda cult head shop?" Penny uh uhs like she knows everything and Jesse's just being paranoid. And still she's waiting for this elusive free beer.  Jake thinks for a long time, "I never heard about him... competition you say... there's a posibility."  Akiko Is a bit of a regular here she spots penny having a spot of trouble . She takes a pull of her drink draining it before looking over at tom with a smirk she slowly wets her lips with a pink tounge gives him an air kiss and moves over to where penny is " Hey back off sluts she's my girl got it? " a few of them seem to want to say something but back off from the tiny girl for some reason.  "Well, I mean..." Jesse just being paranoid is a little like the ocean just being wet. "Like, we were talking about him the last time I was in there. And, I mean, it's not his real name, obviously, so he's already got an alias, and plus Cadence said what he wasn't really a Bokor, but Voodoo says he'll work for paper. So he's some vreiboter houngan, and the whole martyr complex thing just seems a little too pat, you know what I mean?"  His attention, then, snaps to Akiko. He looks her down, then up, then down again.  "You. Bubblegum. Fuck thee off t'a nunn'ry. Past your bedtime, sweets."  Amano arches a brow at their weird gossip, watching it all with sideway interest. When the freaky little lady with the unzipped pants saunters into the mix, he gapes openly. Woo. Crazy. He forces his mouth closed in a naughty grin and backs off to get a better, safer, view.  Jake nod and seems to think about what jesse said. Alot.  Tom read your description.  Daisy's all pomp and swagger, striding in long and straight, like a man. Aviator sunglasses are propped up amongst her bangs; a cigarette droops, angled, from the corner of her lips. High-fives are dispensed at random to assorted punks. Not a regular, but recognized.  Tom is leaning against the bar, his back to the room in general. A broad expanse of back exposed to numerous disenfranchised fringe types who no doubt would like to take a swing at any gentleman matching the description of 'The Man' - and Tom rather fits the bill nicely. Brave man. As Akiko, you know, tongue-wets and air-kisses, and et cetera, she has his full and complete attention. She carries it all the way over to Penny, where, in fact, his attention diverts. Because, he notes to himself, drinking the beer, while Penny looks different, much different, she is in fact, still who she is, and there is little denying... you know, who you are, especially when you know it - or seem to know it - as well as Penny. So, there she is, and there's Tom, sort of studying her, recognizing her instantly but still. Drawn to the sight of a familiar face by an the sight of unfamiliar flesh. God, verb as he is, as Buckminster Fuller identifies Him, does do his action in mysterious ways. Akiko Looks to jesse and flicks a finger at him " Hey I didn't ask you besides I don't see you help her with the riftraft you balless dick " she sighs " Hey girl anybody else gives ya greif just say so I'll nail'em other then that have fun call me if you need help " she then moves back to hop onto her seat.  Penny looks over at Jesse and down at the little asian chick. Literally - downward sloping of the nose, chin and maybe even adjusts her stance because it's one thing to look at him in heels and quite another to look at her - size differences being what they are.  The pitch of her voice changes entirely, turns out a different kind of molasses than the stickysweet lingering at the bottom of those glasses at the end of the night "What he means to say is 'I'm with him'" tipping a nod at Jesse in a stern kind of voice, with a certain kind of educated laughter involved for those in the know "..y'know what I mean? You ah, have a nice night.." And her tongue follows with a kind of clicking, drags on a cigarette and makes some gesture in the air at Daisy-low-on-the-radar.  Jesse is on his feet the moment the word 'balless' clear Akiko's lips. Drawing himself to his full height. Rolling out of his seat and flowing upright to, well, loom. Menace, threat, and the certain presence of jailhouse violence in the angles of his stance as he stares down at Akiko, his head listing slowly first one way and then the other, as though his assessment of her might change, given the rotation of his neck.  "Stand up and say that again."  Akiko Hops down from her seat and looks up at jesse her own blue eye's now ice " Sure " she looks up " I said you didn't seem to be helping her with the other biker girls so I decided to do if for you " she pauses " Or perhaps it was the fact I said balles did i touch a nerve? " .  Amano shrugs up his shoulders, baffled, his fingertips tap-taping on bartop like nervous spiders as he inches away and twist 'round to face them. Hell no, it ain't his place, He winces for the girl's sake, if she doesn't have the sense to do so herself.  Penny hangs back, huffing out another cloud of smoke saying "Jesus he's really gonna blow a hole through somebody f'he don't get laid soon" under her breath. Or maybe to Daisy. Depends on a body's unique perspective. Penny could be talking to herself entirely. So she hangs, kicks a boot onto the bar rung and knocks out another cigarette from a nowhere pocket for the other chick. "Smoke'em if y'got 'em.."  And what she's doing, really, is bracing herself for impact.  Jake just watches for now.  Daisy screws herself down into a seat beside Penny, elbows backed up against the bartop. Lit cigarette transitions from lips to hand and lights the other one, which queues up behind the mostly unsmoked first one.  "He still carryin' around that shiv?", she asks nonchalantly, tapping the aviator glasses down over her eyes. "Fucker don't know that's a parole violation?"  Hiro comes in from the street. Hiro has arrived.  And so this is it: what the evening has been inexorably gliding towards. From the moment he stepped in, Jesse's had a vague foreknowledge that it would come to this, to his gloved hand flexing and adjusting its grip on the neck of a beer bottle, to his squint as he reassesses the space between himself and his fill-the-blanks-in target. The night's had barfight written on it since the beginning, had had the story of the first punch determined even since before Jesse rolled out of bed. His jaw clenches. He looks at the bottle, looks at Akiko, and frowns for a moment, lost in some private reverie. Then blinks.  "Oi, Piggy. Wotcha. You wanna get yer wick dipped? Gotta bluelight here." Some people do not belong in biker bars.  	Hiro, however, posesses a certain fuckered countenance: a indefinite bearing that indicates that -- even if he doesn't belong here -- he personally feels utterly at home anywhere substances which damage neurons are sold.  As such: Hiro, in technicolor dreamcoat, lounge-slumping against the bar alongside Jesse. He rubs his fingertips against the base of his nose; sniffs once, nostrils flaring, scrub with the back of his hand. "Oi, whatsit Jesse J. What's this then?" Akiko Blinks " What? do you speak English at all or ya dumb as well as balless ? " she shakes her head looks at the bottle " You need a bottle too ? big man arn't ya taking on a girl half your size and you need a weapon too , my my arn't we a standing example of macho might. " She clicks her tounge stud on her teeth.  Jake finishes off his beer and puts down the empty glass. He rubs his face a bit and humms a little to himself.  "It's like Batman," Daisy explains to either Penny or no one in particular. "He got this idea beforehand that the fight's gonna go like this, that he's gonna kick some ass, and you can almost see the cue cards. Biff bam boom. Maybe he seen it in a dream, that's why he's gotta do this shit."  She drags from one cigarette and then the other and exhales their intermingled smoke.  Jesse blinks again, looking back down to Akiko. "You still here?" He bares his snaggletoothed grin again. "Ain't your momma worried?" Jesse looks past her once more to Hiro and giggles. "Shit, 'rho. You gotta help me, here. I think I'm gonna hit a girl." Jake waves over to the bartender, "Another beer." And he moves a few seats down out of the way of the impending fight.  At the outbreak of what looks as though it may be violence - well, ok, it's got Tom's bourgeoise values all stirred up, and he's got his middle-class backbone up, which also makes his head dip right down at the suggestion of... a fight? That's what criminals do, isn't it? Well, anyway, it's not what Tom does, and -- more reasonably, with much less cowardice involved, Tom knows enough about crowds to know what fights do to them. It gets them, well, freed up from certain social inhibitions. It's why you so often see armies looting, raping, pillaging. You break one commandment, you might as well go for broke - and when one fight starts, you start to see wild eruptions of others. But Penny, no doubt either his guardian angel or maybe just looks settled - and so Tom doesn't go anywhere. Just yet. Tom finishes his Heineken - by prior arrangement, or happy accident, or perhaps the contrivance of the bartender on his behalf, another is brought to him, and promptly, as in just as he finishes his old one. Oh, kind fate! Happy fortune! Tom sips the new Heineken (perhaps his last) in his civilized fashion, and when he isn't sipping beer, he's got his mouth set into this purposeful, determined line. And, you know, he's sort of occasionally still checking out Akiko's unzipped pants, the tattoo around her tits, the whole thing. //.etro: Petruchio will be joining your location.  Penny mutters to Daisy, "... no... looking,... does... in... direction. That... gesture... passingly... the... a... comraderie... them.... cigarette... lips,... the... stressing to her... impolite and obvious... you slice... down... smoke,... connection... and... starts to... she... motherfucker..."  When no one's looking, Penny does that sidelong thing in Tom's direction. That incredible and timeless gesture of the demimonde. It involves passingly good lighting, the tip of a bottle in a gesture of comraderie and eyelashes. Great huge sweeps of them. Her cigarette burns between her lips, an extension of the words "We're /here/, Daze" stressing to her but talking to Tom's stare, impolite and obvious "it's a violation any way you slice it." Quick fingers draw down the smoke, ashes, re-establishes connection once again. There and there. Penny starts to nod at Tom as she puts a hand on Daisy's arm "So if he's Batman, who's that cool motherfucker over there."  "Why hit her when you can hit that," Hiro mumbles, coming up with a cheap GPC -- once, twice, thrice through the fingers, turning end over end -- and wedging it into one corner of his mouth. The cigarette vibrates at a low hum; pig-boy slaps at the bar for a book of matches, and brings them up for examination. His head tilts to one side; he stares at the little paper sticks. "She looks like a slip'n slide. You got a light, man?" Amano licks his lips and pushes away from the bar, weaving backwards among the tables until the back of a chair japs into his spine, and he takes the hint, takes a seat, and minds his business while he... browses.  And on down the line goes the cigarette, Daisy's second cigarette, to Hiro. It slips between the Asian kid's fingers without a word, and she turns back to Penny, chevrons of concern having already formed across her brow.  "And shit," she says, perhaps too loudly. "I ain't seen one of them since we left San Fran. Never shoot an honest cop, though, that's what I say.  Akiko Shrugs " Swing or get out of my face but youw anna fight me show some back bone and fight with your fists not with some weapon " she spits to the side " Use a wepon I got nothing wrong with sending you to the hospital other wise this is a bit fo friendly sport I don't mind educating a Gaijin every once and a while ".  Jesse reels faintly, rolling his neck back as though with the force of Akiko's words. His brow furrows, his lips twitching as they sound Akiko's speech out, repeating it to himself, as his shoulders rise and fall, nodding with the rhythm of the phrases. Then he grins, and shakes his head no.  "Nope. This is the part where you go home. And I get drunk." He giggles again. "I had the wrong movie for a sec there. Are you sure you're not up past your bedtime?"  The borrowed cherry dips, rises in the smoky atmosphere; Hiro cups a hand around the tip of his smoke, puffing to ignite via the coal. Then, the cigarette goes to his lips; travels to the same corner as it's twin, and both tilt upwards as he inhales. "Don't be so grouchy baby," he advises. He doesn't even look over; he's staring silently across the bar; as if he were struck with a vision. "You're clearly too sober f'r this kinda shindig. Clearly in need." The bouncers slowly come walking over to the altercation in progress. Akiko Snorts " Just as I though balless and dickless " she shakes her head and turns towards the bar " Go away you obviously don't have what it takes gaijin ." she motions for a drink from the bartender.  You paged Petruchio with 'PHENOMENON: With something as simple as the right look at the right time, Penny can lower her target's confidence completely. It's schoolyard rules. Don't mess with the cool kids. (Mind 2) ACTION: She'll come off the bar about a step and get the look in over Jesse's shoulder, briefly, to unnerve the target. Just to check and see he's got things under control and casually move back toward the bar. THEORY: Acting as backup for people (not like bouncers or security but like solid friends with certain knowledge that doom lives in their fists) it is entirely possible to make them look better/more fearsome than they actually are.'  Petruchio pages: Ok... t#5, roll to me. //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Petruchio at diff 5.          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Petruchio pages: Is she nervious about you or about Jesse? You paged Petruchio with 'Jesse. Should he hit her, she'll have a really hard time getting up the nerve to a) get back up and b) hit him (raised diffs by +1 or number of succs? your call totally)'.  "I..." Jesse looks confused. He rubs his face, pinching his nose under his glasses. He takes a deep breath, and tries again. Nothing. He shakes his head. Looks to Hiro for support. I mean, you tell me. Guy standing, bottle in his hand, debating whether or not to break it on the side of some girl's head and she's walking away from him. She's walking away. But she's still talking. Jesse's flummoxed. This isn't the way it works. Something's gone very wrong.  If there is a bottle on the bar in Act One, it must be used on the girl with tape on her nipples by the end of Act Two. This violation of fundamental dramatic rules seems to vex Daisy: you can see the bloodlust seep out of her expression, and her interest return to the bar.   A flick of her fingers summons beer to her side. The bar's bad; the bartender's considerably better.  Igg and Ook, the bouncers, look from one person to the other and say in their best shakespearian terms, "I'd der a problem?"  Jesse is pointing after Akiko and gaping, no comprehensible sound escaping his lips.  Hiro exchanges a wordless shrug with Jesse. "You fucked it up," he offers, mildly. "And it won't work -- that's the wrong kind of liqour, and her hair's the wrong color. Not to mention the bar name isn't even a meaningful anagram. Give it up." Upwards look; ironically or hopefully or seriously or balefully - he flashes a peace sign. Penny looks both ways across the bar, at the bouncers. They see this sort of thing day in, day out - nothing new to them. It'll probably sort itself out. She kinda smiles at one and looks over Jesse's shoulder at Akiko. It's a look not often seen on her face, one so grim and self-assured. Determined. "Go on, JT" chiming accelerated taunts through the bottle. She doesn't touch him - that would be stupid, clearly - but lets the springs inside him tighten, moves back toward the bar.  Akiko Snorts and and hops off her stool walking for the exit " Fuck this place and this shit, no problem I was talking to nothing. " she complete ignores jesse he's beyond her notice now as she saunters towards the door.  Jake puts down his empty mug and heads out himself.  A chemical tang hangs in the air: one of Hiro's cigarettes is giving off a strange aroma, and he doesn't seem to notice. Both get plucked from his mouth in unison; he leans forward to go into assvision mode as Akiko strides off towards the exit.  Let's be honest: Tom is not at all concerned. This is how things operate in the realm of the rational. One guy pisses off one girl, harsh words are exchanged, someone almost gets hit in the mouth with a bottle, and fuck it, it all resolves itself, you know? No one gets hit in the mouth, no one bleeds out, no one dies. Especially not Tom. So Tom relaxes. Tom drinks his beer. Tom looks like a real load got taken off, like his shoulders are no longer stooped under the burden of extremely imminent violence done to his person. Tom lets his own spring come un-sprung, whatever pressing business he was deep in the contemplation of, completely the furthest thing from his mind, such as it is. He fetches a discreet little black box from the pocket of his coat and flips it open. Lifts out a tiny blue pill and discreetly swallows it with a gulp of beer. Before you can say 'the synergistic effect of alcohol with mind-altering psychotropic narcotics', he's got the pill box safe away in his jacket in the midst of all this chaos, and good for him, by god.  Jake slips through the crowd and heads out. Jake heads out to the street. Jake has left.  Amano shrinks down and slinks out of his seat, and since the bouncer's concern has drifted off elsewhere, he hopes his exit will warrent less attention than his enterance.  Amano heads out to the street. Amano has left. Sacha comes in from the street. Sacha has arrived. Akiko heads out to the street. Akiko has left.  Jesse slumps back onto his barstool, the narrative thread of his evening lost. He blinks sleepily and bares a wide yawn, propping his head up on one hand. "Huh."  Nonchalantly, Penny observes of the door hitting Akiko's ass on the way out "Well that was ..fun." A puss a sour turn, a drop in the corner of her mouth where there was the curbed mark of a grin just a moment ago. To her collegues she sighs, flicks a butt off to the side and gestures for another "What the fuck are we /doing/ here?"  In the pocket, an open plastic bag. In the open plastic bag, an anonymous powder. Thumb goes in pocket, thumbnail (a rather unorthodox cokenail, but the only one she can't maneuver to bite down effectively) comes out with a loose payload of upper, and goes to Daisy's nose. She inhales sharply.   Entire maneuver takes, what, four seconds? Entire maneuver's hard to detect, but a sudden rush of induced paranoia causes her to turn back around and pay especial attention to the beer sitting in front of her.  "This place's a buzzkill," agrees Hiro, freeing himself from the counter's gravitational pull with a carefully placed elbow. "I'm gonna go watch the golden girls." With that, Hiro begins to totter off towards the door.  Sacha walks in. It's been a loong time since he's been seen around here. Not since almost getting into another fight with some random person over shit and other shit. The tattooed man heads towards the bar nodding to the bartender looking for familiar faces.  Hiro heads out to the street. Hiro has left.  Yeah. Well. Whatever Tom was here for, well, either he got it (free beer) or it's gone (certain intangible sense of promise - the whole night lie out in front of him, like, to rudely paraphrase, some patient etherized upon a table)... and so, finishing his second beer, feeling the effects of the pill begin to radiate out, feeling a certain clarity of thought, a lack of distortion, an increase in mental fidelity... he's leaving crisp dollar bills on the bar, he's making sure he didn't leave his cell-phone out on the bar, he's performing, yup, all the stuff you generally do before you split.  Penny ohs! like there was something extremely important that was supposed to happen much, much earlier in the evening. "Daze, listen hold up wait, wait" tugging the girl back over to a table near the front. Or whatever. In between biker and bouncer glares, Penny reaches into the deep trench-coat-pocket and pulls out a folded newspaper clipping "We should definitely do this."  The flush that passes over Daisy's cheeks lights her acne scars in sharp relief, even underneath the too-much-makeup. The posture changes too: from shoulders-forward punk swagger to an aw-shucks slouch, eyes averted and expression pointedly unreadable.  "I ain't what you'd call prime material for that," she says, "on account of they'd have to do some pretty serious work on my scars."  From the hand that crosses over to rub at the opposite forearm, it's apparent that it's not just the acne.  And that's that, isn't it? Affairs settled, et cetera, Tom makes for the door. Without objection, it should be noted - the bikers are as gracious letting him out as they were letting him in - that is to say, he has a sore spot on the /other/ side of his ribs, a pleasant little symmetry to contemplate as he eases out into the night and gratefully makes his way home. Penny snatches the paper back from Daisy, just looks at her and says in the most obvious tone "We totally need the money. And I'm not going by myself. Fuck that, my luck I'd get raped and murdered. And I'm *so* not bringing Piggy. He'd .." well whatever it is she says, it's funny and clever and totally girl-talk-private. "Please come? You don't have to like.. do anything. Picture you're an agent," guiding Daisy out the door on the heels of Tom.  Once that's out of the picture, the swagger comes back, and Daisy's inscrutable expression stabilizes, finally, into a scowl. "Yeah. Picture I'm seventeen feet tall and made of gold, 'cause that's way more believable."  Rose White walks in, smiles, and heads over to the bar. Rose White sits down at Long wooden bar.  Tom tries not to let the door hit him on the ass, on his way out. Tom heads out to the street. Tom has left. Penny links arms with Daisy because they are going home together. Not "together" but ..together. Charging out the door. So long, farewell, Auf wiedersehn, good night.  "Good. Because it's on my list of things to do before I die."

      Penny stumbles into the arcade over cans of red bull. They put the garbage cans by the door in places like this; garbage cans, zines, local pennysavers and japanese candies. It doesn't fly off the shelves, the candy, but it's colorful and definitely something to look at. It attracts attention, sterile and neat; super-plastic. So Penny pauses, eyeing the lime green wrappers and the bright red kanji. She kicks another crushed can of red bull from underfoot and throws down some change on the only counter in the place, picks up something brown. Could be chocolate, offers some to Daisy. "So when is it?"   Kaching! Ching-ching-ching-ching-ching! Flashing lights and noisy  coin-drops are the hallmark of a winner in this place, and lo it seems   Mark has struck gold. Or silver, at least, earning himself a payout comprising mostly of dimes and quarters. It's probably only a couple bucks worth. Better than losing it /all/ straight away, right? He seems embaressed by the noise and fuss his particular machine makes, pulling   away from it as soon as he's done scooping up his ill-gotten loot. How is that people like Hiro always seem to be loitering in arcades? Strung out, collar up, shoulders forward, head down. He's gnawing on a thumbnail, feet fixed on the ground a foot (maybe two - well inside her personal bubble) from Daisy, lackluster eyes fixed on the lurid luminescence of a flickering street-fighting game.  Daisy Inscrutable. Veteran job-hunter.  Having been fired from a job as a nurse's assistant, a supervisory position at McDonalds, a non-supervisory position at Hardees, a telemarketing job in Newark, as well as having been kicked out of half a dozen homeless shelters, Daisy has considerable experience at applying for things, from which she's clearly learned nothing at all.  Holding a dirt-smudged set of application papers and a dot-matrix resume, she's standing by the counter, attempting to apply. The oily teen behind the counter with the 2nd Edition Dungeon Masters' Guide doesn't seem to be interested in taking the application. Daisy, over her shoulder, shouts, "It's, like, on the cusp. Which means it should work like it worked before. You got a magick marker?" Somehow, you can hear the 'k'.  Daisy senses "Penny sticks the candy in her back pocket, sweeps the change back off the counter. "Course I do." Easy, fast. But not even the noise gets 'The Manager's attention. "Seriously - early or late century 'cause I think she really fucked with us this time. When was the last time you saw actual MONEY coming out of a game? Nine-teen-eighty, that's when." She looks left then right, nudges Hiro "Even if he can't hear us or see us," indicating the kid behind the counter "..maybe that kid can," indicating Mark.  Penny brings Daisy with her, half hooked by the elbow.  "Hey," they all kind of hover."  He can't hear nuffin'. Mark is far too busy trying to look innocuous to be listening to talk about magick markers and the 80s, stuffing change into  his pocket and trying to find a safer game that doesn't spit coins at him. That's just embaressing. He settles on Time Crisis 3, picking up one of the two pistols out of habit and racking up a line of quarters to keep him 'alive'.  Hiro is picking his teeth with the edge of a prepaid calling card. There's no other explanation or description that befits the behavior -- the corner of the cheap plastic rectangle wedged between two of his front teeth. He's still staring at that arcade game - Tekken, or Mortal Kombat 387, or whatever the fuck it is. "Erin's Vale," he mumbles, quietly. "Crash and I were out last night." He inspects the calling card with the wordless intensity of a artist examining his work. Some kind of yellow caked material - he hasn't flossed recently. "No subway system. We lost six." Having not quite noticed Hiro out of the corner of her eye -- but expecting him to be in a place like this -- Daisy turns back toward Mark.  "Hi," she says, hand shooting out. "'m Daisy Inscrutable. You got, like, a pen or something, 'cause I gotta sign something real quicklike." Already, Penny's tagging the side of the machine Mark's playing on. Whatever she's writing, clearly she's involved otherwise Daisy would've asked to borrow her marker, right?  Right?  Squeak-squeak. Idgy-idgy-squeak. Circle circle. Dot dot. "I'm gonna try something. Remember that thing with the stop-signs? Daze?" Penny peeks around the corner of the side of the machine "Daze, if I'm not back in an hour, get Jesse."  It's a pretty drastic thing to say, if you know Jesse. Even if you don't, it's still a pretty drastic thing to say. She waits for a nod, any kind of affirmation. He barely glances aside, busy picking off the "bad guys" who plague Time Crisis 3. Mark fumbles a hand into his duster coat pockets, fishing out a bright green felt-tipped pen and offering sidelong to Daisy. "Nice t'meet you," he murmurs halfheartedly, still working on killing off the enemy. Blammo, and all that.  Daisy sidles around to obstruct the geek's view of Penny. The latter being considerably taller than the former, this requires advanced sidling technique. Still, she manages to block out most of Penny's scribble-hand.  "Right. Call Jesse. Will do. He still got that tarot number?", she asks.  "Yeah." (says Penny)  And then she runs out.

      The dirty air and stench particular to bad hoods are the same all around the world. Certain cities spice their poverty with a missmash of borrowed or imported culture. Not this one. It's purely American trash-lash. So it's not suprising to find two genuine pieces of American trash patroling the lands of their ilk. Here come Cash and Hiro. Cash a few paces behind, wrinkleing his nose at the dwindling contents of his bottle in a bag.   "Fuck man. 'm low... You got... you a couple bucks?" Cash asks the pig boy and stumbles to catch up.  Dale, on the other hand, walks along at a good clip, eyeing the streetsigns carefully at every intersection. She looks about as out of place here as does the Audi -- no doubt stolen -- parked in front of the army surplus store halfway up the block.  Hiro runs a grimy knuckle across his soup strainer, giving a single, sharp sniff. It is not, per se, that the half-asian mutt -- nothing is more ameritrash than racial mish-mashes such as he -- is dirty. It is merely his hands. Dirty, grimy... these words are mere abstractions. His hands are the pinnacle of filth. He looks like he's been giving prostate exams to the local homeless population. "...it's just, that. It's not enough. You know?" He looks back, eyes gleaming. "We don't have enough energy, enough vis, enough spunk. Things need to be done. You know? We're walking all over the place, and we're just not GETTING anywhere. Do you understand me? Do you dig?" He gets that out fast. Not fast enough, perhaps.  "I dig… I dig that I still dunno where the fuck I am. Thas' what I dig, man.... 'n, 'm a half quart empty." Leaning back in his swaggering gate, he downs the last of the harsh liquid. Crash. Glass shatters as Cash tosses the bottle into the open maw of a metal trash bin when he passes the mouth of an alley. "I was tellin' P, we outta get some peanuts 'r airplane food for her, ya know. Make these random stops more bearable. Every time she drops us off... I'm jus'.. I really want fried chicken." Eyes that have seldom seen sobriety, drift in Dale's direction. "Mebbe she knows..."   "Hey. Ya. You. Cin I ask ya... what city's this?" Cash asks of the flannel girl upon their approach.  On a slightly closer inspection, the yuppie-ish chick doesn't look quite up to snuff for casual day at the office, either. The edges of her boots are caked with cracking mud, her pockets are bulging with who-knows-what, and a few winglike maple seeds are caught up in her hair. She starts, abruptly, when addressed, and one hand goes to the hair over her right ear, dislodging a couple of the seeds. "Uhm. Erin's Vale, it's called, unless they have different names for the 'burbs in this town." She lets out a weak chuckle, the sort which typically displays nervousness rather than humour. "I'm kinda not from around here." She's probably not lying, given that her accent's so acrid as to make vinegar jealous. Hiro shifts his attention towards Dale. Squinting, suspicious eyes. Black coal piggy eyes. Fingertips curl, rubbing together at his sides. And that -- not Dale's response -- is what solicits his -- "Dear venerable judge whopner. Someone has covered my hands in filth," this screamed in a 'sweet holy jesus look at the bats' kinda tone. "Observe my digits. This is disgusting. Who the fuck in responsible for this shit?"  Piggy eyes dart. Dale. Cash. Back  The screams startles Cash's lazy eyes and he woozily turns back to lock his focus on the screaming Asian. His tone is even and pleading. "Holy mackerel.... man. Ya know. No one's responsible for like... yer own dirt karma.... man. Thas'... thas' all you. Thas the dirt /within/ you." To emphasize it's location, Cash pokes a dirty finger of his own back at the open swine mits. With a 'so there' type swipe, the denim wonder points and shuffles back.  Dale flinches as Hiro begins screaming, as if the grating volley of sound is something she can physically duck away from. She edges away up the street, keeping to the edge of the sidewalk that's closest to the buildings, the wary hint of a crouch insinuated into her posture. Still, she doesn't sneer or stalk away in your typical not-in-my-backyard huff; something keeps her hanging back a bit, just keeping an eye out, watching.  "You're a lying fucking swine," hisses Hiro. Dale's departure doesn't cause him to so much as bat an eye. The screaming has stopped, at least -- leaving him with a quiet, manic intensity. Like he's breathing through his eyes. "Someone has done this," he replies, quietly. "And when I find out who, I'm going to eat their fucking liver." Pause. "Not that I'd really. Uh. Eat someone's liver. Just like joshin you around, man. You need money?" His voice takes a dangerous turn for the high-decibel again. "TAKE the fucking money." And just like that, a crumpled wad dredged up from a pocket, all pennies and dimes and dollar bills. Hurled at the sidewalk.  "Easy... EASY... man. Thas' almost six dollars." Concern follows the falling bills that threaten to run off on their own. Cash does need the money, and he stoops low to get his prize. So low. But by fuck, he's got it. And he's smiling. Fun with booze, more of it.   "See? Now we cin.. ya know. Go drink. And you cin stop with yer... sss'''bullshit." Cash walks past the raging mess that's Hiro, grinning a bit and running his fingers over the discarded green. "Erin's Vale. Wha' kinda shit is this place..."  Sure, it's probably a rhetorical question, but Dale volunteers an answer anyway. "Just your average small town going corporate." Whatever else she was about to say gets cut off in a garbled noise that might very well be "Fuck!" as fat raindrops splatter onto the sidewalk, the cars, and her. She fumbles with the zipper of her rain jacket and yanks the hood over her head, shadowing the top third of her face.  Hiro holds his hands out, so the drizzling rain might cleanse the filth from them. He power-walks behind Cash: a slum Jesus in nutjob clothes, offering his revolting boon to the heavens. "Who the fuck is Erin Vale?" he demands of the dime-bag cowboy, as whatever is coating his hands begins to liquify in the rain. This does not make the spectacle more attractive; his fingertips now drift with a material the consistency and colour of something you find under your elderly aunt's sink.  "Aeahhhgg." If you listen closely, that's the sound of god shitting on a homeless man's parade. The heavens open to drop a deuce on Cash's head, in acid rain form. "I dunno man. Mebbe... ya know, she was like an explorer. Who... explored... this place." The side swaggering is curtailed to the side of the buildings to offer some shelter from the downpour.   "Is there a... a liquor store or.. bar 'round here?" It's often really hard to escape from drunk ramblings in the middle of the day, somehow the offending drunkard always seems to corner you for a few questions past smelly. Yes, Dale's downwind. She can smell the old whiskey slightly muddied by the weather clinging to Cash.  Now that beak Dale calls a nose does wrinkle up, in response to both the piss-reek of whiskey coming off Cash and the stench, whether real or imagined, of whatever foulness is rinsing off Hiro's hands and re-exposing itself to the world. Shifting from one foot to another as the mud on her boots re-liquefies, she peers out from under the awning of her hood, casting about for something that might fit the bill. "Got me," she answers at last, then cinches the hood tighter, presenting an effect oddly reminiscent of a bright green snowman.  Hiro flicks his hands at the ground, limply, dislodging several small chunks of particulate matter. He looks off to the side, squinting through the fractal distortion of raindrops spattering his spectacles. "Back this way, wandering jew." The power-walk diverts. Reorients. A goal is now in sight, infusing Hiro with purpose and clarity of direction.  "Later, sheyner ponim..." Cash's off balance smile slurs that out at Dale as she tightens up her face hole. His course wanders, indeed, wherever the tides take him. Today, they lead through drizzling streets towards an unknown destination. Backing Hiro, the denim kid follows the loud pig towards Nirvana.

      You turn up the side street, as the businesses gather together; just past a dry cleaning store and just before a four-story apartment building, the courtyard opens up and you step in.  Tourist District - Courtyard of Shrines          This small courtyard is perhaps twenty feet by thirty feet, open to the street on one side and blocked by buildings on the other three. A dry cleaner is on the first floor of one building, but its upper stories and the other two buildings appear to be residential. The one that forms the back of the courtyard even has small balconies on the upper two stories, and first-floor windows peering right into the courtyard. Near the street are two stone benches, freestanding, and a discreet stone-exterior trash can.         The courtyard itself is mostly paved in cobblestone-style, the stones a diverse lot of shapes, but set well and pleasing enough to look at. Between the paths and the wide central areas are a few flower beds with flowers or even small bushes, and set against the walls along the courtyard are a variety of shrines, all constructed to survive the weather since they will be exposed to it. Here is a stone Buddha statue, and there a figure of Kwan Yin; each shrine occupies a small area, leaving space for the diversity of its neighbors, though they are spaced so that it is possible to face any one without facing its neighbors, at least if you are close.  Contents: Cash Rai Obvious exits: Out    Rai sits cross-legged in front of a statue of the Indian God Hanuman, and nearby Cash leans against a statue of Buddha. The boy gives the older man a disappointed look, though gets distracted by the sparklers in the statue's stomach going out. "Perhaps placing them in the rain was not wise," he opines quietly.  "Well... shit. Yeah, thanks for that. Nobody likes.. a smart asss... fuckin'... smart ass." Take that Asian youth, Cash stands open arrived before the fat man's statue looking into the rain with scrunched features.   To his left, the sogging remains of what once was an offering straight from T.J. "Nobody makes sparklers like Mexicans. They use dog shit ya know."  Under the hood of a large, dark golf umbrella are a pair of long, skinny legs swishing open the sash of a wrapped raincoat. Moving fast through the courtyard, she's sure-footed - clearly a she - the umbrella hefted by the wind. This way. That way. Can see her face. She touches the bronze of a statue, an absent gesture of balance coming up slow behind Cash. He'll notice the shade and she'll say "De nada" quietly then if it's possible to take that down a notch "Supposed to make ourselves scarce til Piggy gets the gr-" Penny looks at the boy "dogs settled in."  Rai blinks slowly at Cash, and doesn't look like he's quite sure how to respond to that. An uncertain, "Oh," is the eventual reply. "Does that burn well?" He looks about to add something else, but promptly goes quiet as Penny comes into his field of vision, looking at her curiously.          This young Chinese boy stands at four foot two, a little under average for his age, and whipcord thin. A strong breeze probably wouldn't blow him over though, there's sinewy muscle there, but it's a highly athletic figure with no excess muscle or fat on him at all. Even as the slimmer average builds of Asians tend to be, this boy is exceptionally lean, lending him an almost starved look. His features are typical of his race, hair so dark a brown it may as well be called black and slanted brown eyes in a flat face. Though not much of a looker, he really does exude a hefty amount of 'cute' in that way kids often do, despite - or perhaps because of - his usually quiet, withdrawn manner.          His clothing shows that he likely comes from a poor household. Baggy, worn black cargo pants that look like they belong on a kid a year or two older than him, dirty old black sneakers and a dark gray zip-up hoodie that's also starting to look worn. He's usually got that layer of general dirt and grime on him that children accumulate, as well as frequently sporting the various bumps, bruises and scrapes of an active kid. When he talks, though his pronunciation is clear, he has a heavy Hong Kong accent that marks him as foreign-born.  "Where are we... again?" The question for miss come lately. Cash shakes his head, nose squinting to match his eyes. "I dunno where the hell we got off." He wields no protection from the rains, his hair smelling like a wet sofa as it soaks in. The answer's not waited upon; Cash gestures back towards Rai with his nightly liquor thermos. "Thasss... Wha' was yer name again? Said it's bedder I dunno." Penny tilts the umbrella into the rain, the noise and bounce echoing in a way that makes Cash a little bit hard to hear. Or did she do that on purpose? She spins it again, repositioning herself to Cash's right, "You know," a look on her face - ponderous "I have no idea. Eva just gets these," picking fallen leaves off her coat, irritated - taking the weather personally "ideas. She get's these great big ideas and runs with them and never tells us anything. She's probably still pissed off at us. Did you see any signs?"  Rai offers Cash a small, almost patronizing smile at the question, but apparently takes Penny's replying to the man as an excuse not to actually respond himself. He reaches up long enough to slick his wet hair back out of his face, but otherwise continues to watch the two of you quietly and as unobtrusively as one can when sitting, well, right there.  "Well, wha' whas' the... thee, uhhh." Cash's thoughts get lost in the rain for some time, though he's sure to cover the neck of his bottle to guard against contaminant. "Fuggit." He waves it off and lifts his haggard form the wet fat man. "I dunno. I don' care. But... I kinda want some chicken. This rain sucks azz...anywayzz." Back into the pouring weather, he peers up a single eye.  The road weary marks of foot traffic have left their stains on this man. An aura of abandonment radiates in a ten foot circle around Cash. It is perhaps the strongest sensational quality about him. His unkempt hair and attire enforce this visage. The man himself stands no more than five foot seven, and that's generous. But a wide little bugger he proves to be. Shoulders set squarely apart from one another. And arms decently adorned with a squat brutish quality. Though his modest beer gut says this isn't a formed build. It's probably genetic. Cash's eyes are usually obscured by wavy dark locks; he's been growing that mop for at least a year or so. In no particular style, really. One day he just stopped going to Super Cuts and it grew with an alien will all its own. Muddy brown eyes peek out occasionally from below the curtain of hair that falls barely below them. This man's a Caucasian, that's obvious. Probably in his late twenties. He's got a large nose to, most probably Jewish or Italian in origin. There's bowed lips below that and a cleft chin. Cash is sporting a good three or four days worth of facial hair, with badly groomed 'burns reaching down ether side of his jaw line sharply.           His clothes are a tad low end. It's typically referred to as a 'Puerto-Rican' suit. Really though, it's just a lot of denim. Faded blue jeans frayed at the cuffs, and a spiked rocker belt with a metal buckle. It's inscribed with flowing letters that read 'Grandpa'. He walks on Chuck Tailors, a pair that've seen better days. They were probably 'white' at some point. Though now they're more of a dingy off-white, showing off black socks through the holes in their heels. To complete the suit he wears a denim jacket. Beneath it, there's a white T-shirt with a picture of Alice Cooper's face. A small golden Star of David about in his neck dangles from a modestly thin necklace. The last notable detail pertaining to Cash, a smell associated with whiskey if you happen to be downwind.   Penny mutters to Cash, "... so... saw... place?... artery-hardening slop... in... then as an aside, lower... we in Michigan?... I... I knew.." she links arms with Cash - her's across his back and vice versa - "..used to know... guy... Nods.... a... you... there's... seven... jails... like... go... Says something,... it." Penny looks over her shoulder at Rai... friend?"" You whisper ""Wait so you saw a chicken place? I seriously doubt it's that artery-hardening slop you found back in Michigan," then as an aside, lower "..are we in Michigan? Fuck I wish I knew.." she links arms with Cash - her's across his back and vice versa - "..used to know this guy Frankee Nods. Heard he did a stretch and a half up around there. Did you know there's eighty seven county jails in Michigan? It's like they expect half the population to go bad. Says something, doesn't it." Penny looks over her shoulder at Rai "Who's yer friend?"" to Cash.  Rai shifts his feet under him, standing up and giving himself a small shake to lose the excess water. Rather ambitious, since more just falls on him again. The two of you are presented with a small bob that's a bit much for a nod, but not quite enough to be a bow, and then he turns and takes off quickly towards the street without another look back.  "Yeah." Cash nods, ducking for a slight reprieve from the rain. "No." Then immediately he denies it. "I dunno who tha' kid is." The bottle that's helping him make a mess of himself, is nudged into Penny's chest for her benefit. She could use some dirt. "Weird though. Lil'... weird lil' freaky monkey boy." The pitch of his voice is raised so he may shout a departing word over the downfall. "Later... man...."  Cash waves.  Penny finally catches on, trades Cash the umbrella for the bottle "Fuck me, what day is it? Tuesday already?" Penny swigs and immediately gets confused "When is it? I need a watch or something. Something Eva won't like enough to steal. I always thought those cushions had no seams, but there's a lot of loose change," sloshing through puddles, she waves to Rai too.  "A lot of loose change."  There's no response from Rai, he doesn't even look back, and is soon out of view as he leaves the courtyard and hangs a sharp left. Rai leaves the courtyard, heading back down the street and out of sight. Rai has left.  "Drink tha' 'n less get outta here. I don't wanna get all dunked by Bhudda. I'm all... farblondzhet." The exchange is forced again, Cash takes the whiskey bottle back for a damp jacket and starts down the path.   Each collar propped like the Fonz, he'll cool it all the way down to the little people. "I cou' /really/ use some chicken though. We gotta get some kinda airline food up in her or somethin'. Maybe... a... a lil' thing a' peanuts. Salted, ya know."  "Salt peanuts? With Eva?" Penny keeps walking, but unevenly - as strangely poised as her words "Not unless you get fat, turn black and start playing the trumpet." She swipes at the corner of her mouth, phantom alcohol and the damp making her fingers twitch.  That's it for a while from her. She's entering her s.o.p. for new places - easy to catch once you know what to look for - a long walk, loaded to the gills, for as far as she can go until the roads divide the landscape into well-groomed and doomed.  "Find me somewhere quiet - I need to," trails off.

      (continued from the last post)  As the familiar homeboy struts from the alley, the gang lounges still, but the hollow eyes now glitter with lust unspoken. It remains so as they rise to their feet, gathering about the one who has journeyed into shadows known for sins enjoyed. Hands are stuck out; brown, crooked teeth are flashed in vulpine smiles as voices coarse echo in a confusing chorus. "Buddy!...Jose'....What...Give...Fucker hogging...Whiny bitch...GIVE IT!" The last cry is one of unanimous assent as the outstretched hands are thrust again at the newly arrived figure, demand writ plainly upon ape-like features.  "You got the fuck-up, we get the shit, remember?" The question comes from one of the unholy choir as the others echo their approval of this statement. Brows lower as they glare now, waiting with impatience for the dulling of sense and quickening of pulse...  "Step the fuck off, yo."   Deep within the soggy sponge that is Cash's brain, a foreign source of neuro electronic activity is hard at work.   Looking into our world from a watery dimension, sits an old Chinese man over a thousand years old. Chicken legs crossed and his knobby fingers grasping the gnarled end of a walking cane, Sifu Sun Fook doesn't look a day over five hundred. This altered state has been kind to him. And in the deep recesses of a parallel stream of reality, he strokes his white beard and produces a sucking sound between the gaps of his ancient teeth. The celestial lotus he sits upon offers up a jewel encrusted cup, filled with an ethereal substance that measures five thousand percent alcohol. It's sipped, he cackles, looking through a portal cut in the shape of Cash's dull eyes.   And when Cash' speaks again, wearing the skin of another monkey, he sounds utterly convincing to match the clone which his body has contorted into.   "I said step the fuck off, fuckin' vultures. This shit's on time. Boy came correct up in here. Ya'll check it." Looking about, the interloper spots the lead man on the totem to address further. A stream of Mandarin characters scrolls down his mind's eye, feeding him the secrets that were held in the dead man's skull. To the fat cat, he hands over one of the rocks, his bounty. So he may be measured and weighed. "Check this shit, top dawg."  At the words and the hollow echo that hangs for seconds upon the air in their wake, a glass tube with a rounded bowl at the end is produced from beneath leather jacket. Eyes rimmed with red and darkness flicker to one of the dark ganstas standing beside. The loyal acolyte draws a lighter from a hip pocket with a dazed smile. This action is mirrored by a hand plucking the proffered prize. The prize is lifted to the bowl and dropped into place as the iighter follows suit. A bubbling drawn from tales of Shakespeare and destinies fatal begins and a deep breath is drawn. Eyes close as muscles slacken, leaving a mask of idiocy in its wake. Silence as the eyes of all remain focused upon this still figure and when he exhales, the gang echoes the harsh rasp.  "That's good shit. Fuckface must'a been a narc. Glad ya wasted the fucker." The eyes are open now, glazed with symptoms known and settled upon the young gansta who holds the glittering treasure. "We needa show this shit to Marco. Get lots of money." The eyes narrow, focusing upon the gansta's hands as there's an addition to this statement. "We coulda be real rich. Real rich, amigo."  "Faggot said he hadda gang a this shit. But, I only found this, knaw wha' 'm sayin'. But they gotta be more a' this shizzle somewhere, believe dat." The interloper jabs at the prize with one finger from way above his shoulder. Keeping a respectable distance from top dawg, but feigning interest in the second hand effects of Pobble's uber-crack smoke, Cash lingers.   "Yo. 'M gonna check if dis boyz' address on his I.D. is fer reals. We'll come right ta Marco. Get some mutha fuckin' props up 'n here."  "Si. Stupid fuckers donta deserving it. Fuck man, we fuck Marco." The words are delivered with a slight slur as his eyes twitch from the promsing gansta and the giggling acolytes. The pipe is lifted again for another toke. An acolyte's grimy hands rise as if to take the pipe while the silver breath is savored. The hands don't make it far before a hand falls to the leader's side. It rises again in the next second, a trail of droplets flying through air as the rising hand bears a knife which steals grasping fingers from the now-marked Judas. Nothing is said as the Judas falls to his knees clutching the hand and cursing in a high-pitched voice. There is a kick then. The thud marks the change in cries from loud curse to low whimper. Blood pools beneath as Judas clutches his groin with tearing eyes and drooling mouth. The silver breath is now released, frosting the words now spoken with illogic.  Floating by, the formless embodiment of a character dreamt up in the bed of a nine year old Hindu boy swims and distracts Sun Fook for a moment. Dirty and long nails rake through the spirit matter, which feels much a spring breeze from the back of 69' Mustang. Lips smack a toothless sound, the Sifu returns to the conversation at hand. The purple lotus leans him towards the window of Cash's eyes so that he may reach through them and into the fat street urchin's weakened mind.   A handful of thoughts are pulled in his weathered and callused grasp. Those pertaining to Marco, those that describe the man and his position, and how to find them, thoughts that are inspired by the scheming mention of fuck overs and dirty dealing.   Cash, as gangsta, grins just as broad as he should, and not a millimeter more. "Yo, 'm come back in a few. We'll halla' at Marco then, see what the shit we come with."

      Downtown - Diaz District -= Raven and Pike =-          It is the three-story mall that seems to beckon people from all sorts of financial incomes into the area. Its large parking lot is available for plenty of room for shoppers to fill up their vehicles with its goods and empty their pockets in one easy day. Various crosswalks and shopping centers have sprung up surrounding the mall's center of fame, seeking to draw consumers to their market as well and indeed, succeeding.          Across the street from the mall lies a large shopping center, featuring a large movie theater in its court. Also to draw attention are large fashion stores, everything from the upper end dresses of the year to the inexpensive photography studio to show off your looks to friends and family everywhere. An interesting concept of note is the shuttle bus that moves from the mall to the shopping center across the street, allowing consumers to easily make their way from one area to the next with little effort.  ===============================| +IC Time |================================                    Current Time: Thu Dec 18 14:27:17 2003                     Time of Day: Afternoon (Daylight)    Weather: Overcast Moon: Waxing Crescent         Temperature: 45F (7C)  ===========================================================================  Penny has run off to the goddamn bathroom. Girls going to the bathroom in malls is almost an hour affair. And. You guys have all her purchases. You are loaded with bags. Not just any bags - these are definitely girly-looking shopping bags. An embarrassment and an eyesore.   So. Where there's a mall, there's a food court. where there's a food court, there's cheap food. Where there's cheap food, there's McDonalds. So these three people: one Penny, Hiro, and Compton - a young lady and her disheveled gentleman callers. And they're standing in front of the McDonalds counter, right?  So - Penny's off in the bathroom, /powdering her nose/, dig, and Compton's drunk, and Hiro is arguing with the pimple-faced girl behind the counter, apparently over the contents of the happy meal. There's some contention over the toy.  "They have them in Canada," he tells the girl, glowering. "I swear to fucking god. Where's your manager? Who made you a manager? How can you NOT KNOW?"  Compton looks around lazily like a Hindu cow. MAss consumerism seems to be draining the life from him by the second, with only his belly full of liqour to numb the pain. Mall security would normally be all over this type of guy and sweeping his quietly out the door, but for some reason they haven't noticed him. Most likely a Union outfit has sway here and no one else has screamed 'BUM!' yet. So he continues as Penny's pack mule. ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Mike................An introverted, wild-haired academic. Height: 5'10 Weight: 170#   Age:     App: 2  Cha: 1  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Compton.............Dirty old man. Height: 1.8m Weight: 67 kg.

Height: 5'9" Weight: %b     Age:     App: 3  Cha: 3   -----------------------------------[ - ]------------------------------------  Mike is all but unnoticeable in the food-court crowd. Like most Americans and most geeks he has absolutely no clue of the caloric value of a double bacon cheeseburger with biggie fries and a super-sized Dr. Pepper, and devoured them like a thirteen-year-old girl reads _Tiger Beat_. Now there are just empty wrappers, vestigal shells of the carbohydrates which they once contained, and a brown plastic tray. He finished some time ago, judging from the appearance of his small and uncomfortable food-court table, but he's still sitting there writing furiously in his notebook. And writing furiously on the inside of his burger wrapper. And writing furiously on the back of his hand. And writing furiously on... whatever it is that he's doing, it seems to involve an awful lot of writing.  Hiro comes up with this little like, piece of paper, right? Not even a piece of paper - like one of those reminder notes for UPS or USPS or PSU or whatever to tell you that you missed the package, asshole, and now it's gonna take you 3 days to find it. And he's scribbled something on the back -- looks kinda like a tamigotchi's face, like one of those little keychains. Only the face is like a symbol, right? Following? And that symbol just happens to be ole Gabe, gabby, Gabriel's name. As in archangel. And these things were on TV maybe six months ago in another country and Hiro's right now just like jabbing his finger at the piece of paper. Like - what's this. Look at it. Stop lying.  "Jerking me around," Hiro accuses, loudly. Making quite a scene.  "Hey man, it was like another country, ya know?" Compton says, his voice rolling across the gravel in his throat, "Fucking Americans thing Canada is the States. It ain't ya know? Shoulda got it the first time you saw it now leave the poor kid alone." You sense Compton isn't sticking up for the McClerk as much as he's just annoyed with everything around him right now.  Mike isn't looking at the scene, but not in the same way that everybody else is not looking at the scene. Everybody else is not looking at the scene in the way that they would deliberately not see a big gray elephant in the middle of the room. Noticing the disturbance would necessitate them making some difficult social decision, like calling the cops or telling you guys to grow up and get civilized, so it's easier to just not notice anything. Mike, on the other hand, doesn't notice anything because he's so locked away inside his own head that he probably is no longer aware of the outside world existing. At least, existing in any sense beyond "the place where I write down my stuff".  "Fine, fuck, just trying to kill the days we're waiting for mr level fucking seventeen half-elf illusionist to show up." Hiro crumples the post-it note up as he abandons McJobette, hurling the scrap of paper into the garbage. Hopefully Gabriel won't take notice. "We've been here like fifteen minutes."  "Here" says Compton as he heaves the bags towards Hiro, "Go, find a place to sit. I'll get Pizza while Shoperella does her thing."  Compton. Old hand at surviving Malls. Fuck, the guy is older than the concept of Malls.  "Don't go to Dominos," and Hiro says it like he's threatening murder. Brand loyalty enslaving us and all that. Shouldering the gargantuan burden, Pigboy hop jump skip stumbles his way right to Mike's table. "Yo," he greets, before depositing the load of crap onto his table. "Nice day out." We're inside.  Mike finally takes a break from writing _War and Peace_--or whateverthehell he's doing--and stares for a moment at the burger wrapper he's littered with glyphs. He reads it, blinks a few times, scowls a moment, mutters something about utter trivial tripe, and crumples the failure up just as Hiro comes over. "Uhh." Brilliant conversation-starter, isn't it? He just looks at Hiro, blinking a few times, still holding the crumpled wrapper, desperately trying to shift mental gears into something vaguely resembling normalcy. Then--"Hi." And you know why it's been fifteen minutes? 'cause fucking Penny is taking her goddamn time. Should know better by now not to cut a woman loose in a mall if she hasn't left her bag. The one she keeps the creditcards in. This fifteen minutes will surely turn into an hour - count on it. Piggy'll remember in just a few how she couldn't put down those dumb slogan undies at Urban Outfitters until he forced her to. And at about the same time, Compton'll think "Bathroom my ass."  "Is that a tamigochi?" Hiro doesn't so much take a look at the paper as leer at it, snatch at it. Grabby bastard. Like he's gotta have it right now. Oh, and his pupils are like an animal's when your headlights hit them like right before you plow over the fucker and make roadkill burgers. Wired. Now's the time to note, when he's like a foot and loose change from your face and grabbing wildly.  Mike doesn't contest the hold on the wrapper; he just lets it go as if it's of absolutely no use whatsoever. Which, to his lights, it probably isn't; after all, it's trivial tripe, easily discarded. What's on the wrapper? Scribbled linguistic analyses of ... good lord! There's Chinese, Devanagari, hieroglyphics, an entire Comparative Linguistics thesis boiled down into tiny, terse letters and symbols. If this guy speaks all these languages, it's real puzzling that he's so lousy with English.  "HmmMmMM," Hiro spits out, like he's really pleased, interested, fascinated. So much so he crumples the wrapper up and drops it -- complete with overflow ketchup and a couple onion bits -- into Penny's bag. The one she got from that really expensive store. The stuff that's all silky and wrapped in tissue paper. "You're Mike," he accuses.  Mike shakes his head no. "My name is /called/ Mike," he answers. "My /name/ is Michael. I am neither Mike nor Michael." Okay, someone's just shown themselves to be a few flavors shy of a Fruit Loops box. He says nothing else, showing a talent for conversation that's nothing shy of autistic.  "Well the method by which I choose to identify you is Mikey Mike, or Mikeadoodleskroodle, you dig. I'm Hiro Stice. You can infer the identities and names and nicknames of my esteemed associates, right." And Pigboy here, he lays like this card out in front of you, some kind of like rave flyer, but it says THE INVISIBLE COLLEGE and it's got these numbers, names, words, ideas all over it. "Yo, call us tonight, huh? You can come by the warehouse. Meet everybody, like. We can talk shop and braid each other's hair." Mike looks up at Mike, blinking a few times as he tries to parse out these words. "Okay," he finally says, taking the flyer from Hiro and placing it into his notebook. Quietly, he gathers up his papers and tucks them in as well, then closes it all up and returns it to his satchel. "If you'll excuse me? I've got things I really must be doing." Things in Devanagari, no doubt.  "Pleasedtapleasedta, Mikey." Hiro looks back at Compton, or at least looks for him - and kinda like, forgets Mikey Mike. Not in a rude way, but in a 'walls bleeding must stare' kinda way.  Compton's booty is held low and close to his body, by his quick movements and darting eyes you get the sense that he's up to something. "There ya go. Tacos." he says as he deposits the tray on the table. No, not pizza, tacos. Easy mistake though.  "Taco bell. You fucking swine," hisses Hiro. Hiro steps through a void into the OOC Nexus. Hiro has left.  Compton shrugs and retorts a 'Yeah, whatever Piggy.' and grabs up Penny's bags and makes tracks before the Taco's owners get wise to their food whereabouts. He heads towards a La Senza boutique. May contain Penny, but if not - oh well.

      (Cash starts in his effort to infiltrate the local drug competition.)  Another foggy and shitty day here in lovely Erin's Vale. A blanket of obfuscation for the seedier elements of the world to hide under. If it was ever sunny, the dealers and pimps might scatter like roaches when the lights go on. But, the lights are off. And the roaches are deeply entrenched in their hidey holes and comfortable corners of opportunity.   Enter Cash. White, disheveled, and out of place in this neighborhood. 'S a miracle he's made it this far, really. Brothers watch the semi retired video editor shamble through the concrete jungle, probably another junkie looking for the next high. His sneakers carry him towards a few gangstas patrolling the front of a liquor store. Looking for marks, johns, or victims. Cash could be any of the above. Whiskey aura just detectible, he approaches said gangsta.   "Hey, man."   Amidst the fog and human detritus that lie across broken concrete and beneath black shadows of ancient sins, the white man draws interest and hunger. Yet, there is no action taken. Those hungry eyes merely widen as the man walks without seeming care or knowledge of the dangers held within this dying land. They withdraw to hidden alleys and soft curses as the fool walks towards the lords of this realm, daring to tread where even seraphim fear to look.          The words uttered receive a look of surprise, wide eyes and dropped jaws, from those men to whom the foolish white boy speaks. There is a pause as the comical expressions refuse to leave their features before a bout of laughter wracks the group. The laughter dies soon enough as one of the crew takes a swaggering step closer to this fool as a hand slides beneath loose clothes to grasp the unseen.  "What up, holmes? Bit far from home?"  "Yeah. Totally." The slurred response of the inebriated. The picture gets clearer; this must be a bum who's lost his place in the soup line. Homeboy can smell alcohol leaking from Cash's pours. He sweats the stuff. There's even a personalized bottle tucked under layers of denim which looks just as worn as the man himself.   "Ya know, I don' even know where I am, ta tell the truth, man. Like, where cin cracker like myself score 'round here." The jean scarecrow looks about, ensuring the relative safety of their interaction. It's not safe, for him. But at least there's no pigs patrolling. That could be a good thing, or a very very bad thing. Ether way, he continues to play the part of the searching white junkie.  "Ya wanna' score?" The chorus of jeering laughter rises from behind the delegated representative of the lounging gang at the question asked. The laughter is acknowledged with a quick smile and look over shoulder. Then, with that smile firmly in place, another step is taken as the young man reaches out to lay his other hand reassuringly upon the junkie's shoulder. "Right place, wrong time, amigo."  There's a quick look about the street before attention settles once more upon the drunk with a smile grown wider by several degrees as an additional question is broached. "Got some money, amigo? 'cause if ya do, we might have the hook-up. Just gotta have the cash is all." There's another glance back towards the lounging men behind as another chorus of coarse laughter rises.  "Mmmm. Yeah. Dinero. Well... here's the thing..." Cash reaches into the greasy depths of his jacket pocket, withdrawing a handful of Pobble's primo cooked surprise crack rocks. It's held in his weathered and callused palm, jiggled within as his heavy eyelids are propped at half mass.   "I got these rocks here. 'N I don' really dig the stuff, ta tell ya the truth. I want some weed, but 'm willin' ta fork over like... two sixty bags of this shit for a good eighth of green. Or a lil' tar... Here..." Cash palms the off-white rocks over in a conspiratorial fashion. "Check that.. see if ya like it. If you gotta a rig, I'll smoke with ya. Ya know, jus' so you feel alright 'bout me, man."   Standard police narcotic procedure forbids partaking in controlled substances; this is an offer to show the homeboy he's not a cop. Might be a victim, but he's not a cop.  The laughter dies suddenly at the mention of a lack of green. Narrowed eyes and absent smiles greet the prouncement. Yet, the dark expressions lighten once more as huge grins spread across coarse features. The young gansta who stands before the would-be junkie blinks and then drops his hand from the junkie's shoulder to the white rocks glittering upon the proffered palm. One rock is deftly plucked from the offering and lifted to eye level. A moment's inspection returns a slight shrug as askance is looked at the crew steps behind.  "Try it!" The words are harsh as greedy eyes widen and their utterance prompts the gansta to pocket the rock before the hand rests upon the shoulder of the junkie once more. Pressure is delivered firmly as he takes a step towards a nearby alley. "Come on, amigo. There's a pipe back there. We can smoke a few and talk."  He'll find a willing subject, and Cash will accompany the gangster without abandon. A funeral march of sorts. Dead man walking. But this is Cash's game. And if there's a coffin in that alley, it doesn't belong to the wandering Jew.    "Far out." Words escapes Cash's chapped lips, and two fingers reach up behind his left ear. They're placed in a precise spot, a practiced movement he's intimate with. It's stimulates the Ki source lying dormant beneath tendons and muscle. Pressure's applied, and he adds a swig of whiskey from the bottle hiding under his denim flap. Lips smack at the sensation, and he wipes a small river of alcohol that threatens to run down his chin.    The pressure point spreads throughout his body warmly. Coupled with the rush of fire water, and an unseen hand gesture, his organs and vital points align themselves in a configuration least likely to suffer injury from a surprise attack. He prepares his mind and body for a deal gone wrong, though there are no signs of such an event.... yet.  WEATHER REPORT: The snow changes to a cold rain. The guiding hand draws the junkie towards the alleyway as another look is shot towards the now-snickering crowd. That hand, the one kept beneath clothes slips free finally with its contents hidden from the junkie by the gansta's body. The snickering grows louder as the young gansta starts talking with a jovial air, "Very, amigo. You gringos are nuts. Ya got rocks to match the huevos swinging between yo legs. Ya got style. Shame man." The final word ends with the hand slipping from shoulder to center of the junkie's back.  There's a sharp pressure and the junkie receives a sharp shove as the gansta swings his other hand up in front of his body. The hand's contents revealed now, black steel glinting with dangerous promise. The gansta laughs and spits out, "Real shame. Bueno dias, senor."  Not that this wasn't to be expected, but perhaps Cash had thought this part would come latter on in the game. Bearing gifts of crack cocaine doesn't usually get one shot, but this is the path this unlucky gangsta has chosen.   At the edge of the cliff, Cash offers one last life line for this homey to grab, before the jagged rocks below consume him utterly. "Hey... man. You go mugging yer customers, 's bad for business ain't it? I mean.. check that stuff. It's primo. I could be a cash cow fer you." The remains of the rocks are held out for the plucking, palm open and inviting. His other hand, meanwhile, has fingered out a small red chili pepper which is placed between his teeth. The 'hotter than shit' variety teeters in his choppers.  "Shut up, fucker. Only really stupid pieces of shit just up and offer prime shit like that!" The words are uttered with the sharp taint of rage that is followed by a quick step that draws the gansta even closer to the junkie. The gun is lifted in a sharp gesture as the rant is continued, "Any last words, bitch? Like an offer to suck my dick, you fucking homo?"  The rage only grows as another step is taken and brows draw together. Lips pull back from teeth far from the color of white in a bitter snarl. "Get on your knees, fucker." The hand is lifted slightly to direct the barrel towards the ground as the phrase is repeated with a harsh jabbing motion, "On your knees!"  The snap of the chili pepper's skin starts what appears a wildly stupid move to the untrained eye. Small white boy junkie versus gun wielding gangster on his turf. But this is beyond the eyes of his croonies, and this is no ordinary shmuck. The chili is crunched between his teeth, spilling its acidic contents into Cash's mouth. The sensation fuels a strike, now that the gangster has made the unfortunate mistake of pointing the tip of his barrel at the ground. He couldn't ask for a better opportunity to end this, real quick-like. And so what appears to be a drunken stumble forward ends in the deft protrusion of a two fingered strike to the underbelly of the would-be assailant's chin.   The strike aided by the configuration of his fingers, and the tingling of chili spreading over his tongue.  There's a harsh exhalation of breath between clenched teeth at the stumbling junkie's approach and the barrel of the gun starts to rise. Yet, the motion is far too late as the junkie moves past the barrel's end and places him within inches of the gansta. There's a sharp pain that prompts eyes to widen in shock to accompany the wet tearing sound of flesh and tissue giving way before force. The junkie's fingers slip past the boundary of skin in a spray of blood.  Muscles slacken as lips part, a crimson tinged bubble growing before his lips. Fingers slide from the striated grip of the gun with a clatter of steel and broken thought.  Lazy eyes drop to the crumpled mass below, Cash shakes his head at the waist and wipes his fingers on jeans stained by thousands of miles of concrete.   "Fuckin' mushugina."   At that, he bends at the knees to place the gun in his waistline, not that he'd know much what to do with the thing. At least his face is intact, it'll make it that much easier to copy. Wallet's next. He'll know the name; he'll know the 'alleged' address. If this gangster's not connected, he'll know someone that is. And the game will continue. The puffy Phila jacket looks retarded on Cash, and it's a tad too big. But when he leaves the alley, it'll fit just right. Away from prying eyes, fingers still ripe with blood are placed on ether side of Cash's Jewish face. This will be vulgar, but he's got time to kill. A little paradox sandwich, he'll enough it with a pickle.   The shifting of muscle and pigment is inaudible as he depresses portions of his skull that cause his skin to convulse. It feels right strange, but he's done it before. Cash, looking down at the dead dregs of humanity, slowly takes on the appearance of the failed criminal. Skin darkens, bones adjust. Within seconds, he's the shvatsa.   Attaining his new height, just a few inches taller, he tests his shoulders and rolls them. Knuckles crack as Cash gets used to this new form. For effect, he takes out the clumsy weapon on his waistline and points it down at the dead man's face.   *BAM*   That should alert his homies that the task is done, and when gangster runs out the alley clutching rocks and tucking away a piece, it's a good indication the white junkie will never be coming out of that alley again. The shot was placed close enough to the gangsta's face that he should be unrecognizable to forensics.   The first stage is done. Identity stolen, Gangsta Cash appears with a smile to his 'new' homeboys and takes off racing. "Fuckin' score, yo." He'll be back, to find the big fish at the end of this line.

       Keene Arrives.   Old GE Plant - Warehouse       During it's tenure as a legitimate industrial facility, natural light would flood the workshop floor -- some thirty feet beneath the peaked roof -- by means of louvered skylights. In the transition into a gomi shrine, these have been long since sealed away beneath plaster and black paint: webbed over with extension cords and network cable. The sole artifact of the original facility -- an enormous iron cargo hook, suspended by an equally cyclopean length of chain -- supports the loft's dim noveau sun[1]: a sphere of gutted television screens some five feet in diameter.      Where oiled machines once crouched, muttering and grinding implacably along, new beings[2] now congregate in silent communion: gathered in dimly illuminated corners, their faces turned upwards to the flickering solaris. Mickey Mouse -- or, at least, a plastic facimile thereof -- is here, human-sized and cheerfully vacant eyed. Ronald McDonald[3] sits on a wooden bench, his injection-molded face fixed in it's familiar, eternal grin. They number in the dozens; the fading icons of commercial success.      Twin rust-colored cargo containers stained with graffiti[4] scrawl flank the loft's dominant space -- the wide expanse of open lucite[5] floor -- in a broad 'V'. Fat bundles of zip-tied cables pipe electricity and data down to and up from the consoles which dominate a raised platform atop each container: the left bearing slimline turntables and mixer, the right a complex array of patchwork electronics and monitors.          [Footnoted +views]  Contents: Harrison Obvious exits: Fire Door    Hallway    Roof Access    Harrison is standing by the entrance to the hallway. He spins around at the sound of the door opening.  ***  Harrison:          The fourty-something man before you is a striking figure indeed. He stands about 6' tall, with a fit, barrel chested form. It is clear that this man is in very good shape for his age. His eyes are a deep chocolate brown, and he sports a neatly trimmed beard and moustache that matches his short 'salt and pepper' color hair.          His clothing is a bit odd, perhaps he's an entertainer or a hotel waiter. He's wearing black trousers, black dress shoes, a fitted violet waistcoat and a deep red cravat. The sleeves of his Victorian collared amd starched white shirt are rolled up exposing his muscular forearms. A diamond stickpin holds his cravat in place, and the chain of a gold pocketwatch dangles from his waistcoat pocket.          When he speaks, you detect an upper crust British accent. It's clear that he's 'not from around here' as he seems slightly unfamilliar with routine American customs.  ***          The door doesn't open immediately. Before anyone else arrives, there is the sound of a luxury sedan -- glimmers of it are seen through the dirty windows and gaps in the walls -- rolling past the gate, winding around behind the building, and coming to a halt. The vehicle shuts off, and a man in a suit gets out. The driver's side door closes; the trunk is popped. The man takes something large and heavy-looking out of the trunk, then slams the trunk shut. The large object rolls unsteadily behind him while he walks towards the factory, the familiar *blip blip* of the car alarm arming a second later.         The man in the suit opens the fire door. He is smoking a cigarette and looks moderately aggreviated about something. The case behind him is one of those matte black metal operations that, in movies, usually contain nuclear weapons or other unpleasant things. When it hits the concrete, it makes a scraping sound as the wheels dig into the flatter ground and even the case's travel out.         He doesn't even look up as he trundles forward through the center of the factory floor, ash flicking off his cigarette behind him.         "You," he directs to Harrison, flatly. "You're trespassing. Beat it."  Harrison arches an eyebrow at the well dressed man as he slips a handheld device of some sort into his waistcoat. In a cultured British accent he replies, "Really? I was led to believe that I was welcome here. Though current experience seems to indicate otherwise."          The man wheels the case into the center of the room, orienting it up on its side using the handle. He smacks the handle against the ground, driving it into two conveniently available holes to keep it moored in place.         Keene takes the cigarette out of his mouth, ashes it, and looks over intently at Harrison for a few moments. He squints, takes another puff from his cigarette, and looks at something that isn't there behind Harrison before speaking again.         "Who invited you?" he asks. "What is your authorization here?"  Harrison says, "As I mentioned to your.....er....collegues..." He stumbles a bit, trying to find the right word to express his thought. "My name is Lord Harrison Wells. Of the Electrodyne Engineers. Does that answer your question, Sir?"          The annoyance fades from Keene's features slowly. Either the nicotine is starting to kick in, or he has some reason to expect visitors. He takes another few puffs from his cigarette, getting within polite conversational distance of Harrison.         "It answers one of them," he says. Keene reaches into his jacket, producing a pack of cigarettes. Tapping on the pack, he offers one of the cigarettes -- it's a pack of Merits -- to Harrison.         "You'll have to excuse my rudeness earlier. We're all a little jumpy from the circumstances that brought us here. My name is Steve. I'm promotions and public relations for the group."  Harrison extends his right hand in greeting, waving off the offer of the cigarette with his left hand. "No thank you Mr. Steve. And I do not know of the circumstances that brought you here, but I take it they were somewhat less than pleasant."          Keene fluidly returns the pack of cigarettes to his breast pocket while giving Harrison a proper, firm handshake. "I won't go into the gory details. Suffice it to say, we have become wary of unexpected visitors, especially when we haven't gotten to know the other people in our community yet. It is fortunate that nothing untoward has happened to you -- it's lucky I got here when I did. If you had set off any of the alarms ... well, those things are entirely automated, as are the countermeasures."         Keene ashes his cigarette to his side, with the wind, to knock the ashes away from the two of you. "So what brings you here, Lord Wells?"  WEATHER REPORT: The sleet begins to slow and then stops altogether, though the dark clouds still remain overhead.  Harrison chuckles, nodding in response to your comment about the alarms. "I suspected as much. I was in the process of calculating the likely location through the labyrinth you have set up here."         "I am here simply because I was hoping to meet a few like minded individuals. I too am new to Erin's Vale and I have yet to meet any associates."          That prompts a small, fleeting smile from Keene. "Yes. I imagine anyone in your position would be interested in locating comrades. I wish I could provide some assistance to you, but I have only just arrived in town this morning. I haven't even checked my e-mail yet."         He takes his cellphone out of his jacket, meddling with it for a while. Text messaging, it looks like. He paces as he does this, continuing to speak. "Tell me a little bit about yourself."  Harrison says, "Only arrived in town this morning? I do not mean to offend, but how do I know that you indeed are someone to be trusted? You have the advantage Sir and yet I have no assurance as to your intentions."          "May I remind you," Keene says, continuing to tap at his cellphone, "that on meeting me, you introduced yourself with your full title and affiliation without me so much as soliciting it. Now is not the time to be second-guessing yourself in terms of issuing trust."         He finishes tapping at his phone, hits send, and puts it in his jacket pocket while awaiting a reply. He looks back at Harrison. "Not to be rude, Lord Wells, but you are on our property demanding things of /me/. This is somewhat backward, wouldn't you say?"  Harrison nods. "Indeed. I simply extended the courtesy of an introduction. Evidently I will not be recieving one in return. If you wish me to leave, I will do so. If you wish to discuss matters of interest to both of us, I will also do so. What I will not do is subject myself to an interrogation when it should be obvious to you that I am who I say I am.          Keene reaches into his pocket when it vibrates, producing his phone. He looks at the readout, scrolling down through the message quickly before pocketing the phone again.         "No," Keene says, patiently, "nothing is obvious, Lord Wells. Since I don't have all of the information about who is who in this city, you could very easily be a disguised Technocrat, a robot duplicate, an intrusion clone of someone calling himself Lord Wells, or a hard-light hologram projected from an orbital platform that appears to be someone called Lord Wells. You could also be controlled by a vampire by some means, or otherwise not be entirely who you say to be."         He puffs on his cigarette, looking evenly at the foreign gentleman. "That I have not sounded the general alarm indicates that I have a small measure of trust in others. Said measure is all I have left after my experiences elsewhere in which several of my friends and colleagues were murdered without cause. Therefore, I would appreciate at least a small measure of patience from you? It is not as if I am asking you for anything more than a very basic statement about who you are and what you are interested in."  >> He had to leave, then.

      Downtown - Montrose District(#454RJ) -= Jones and Clarke =-          Small shops line the streets, obviously an older part of the city, the initial settlings of Erin's Vale can be seen here. Some of them are reconstructed, new paint and wood being replaced on their structures, while others slowly decay from age. For the most part the small shops still manage to have a quaint appearance, allowing those that enjoy to pursue the history of the city to see some of it still evident.          It was the introduction of a night club near the eastern side of the street however that caused some of the old fashioned store owners to cringe. It caters to those of more extreme and eccentric tastes, bringing a whole new variety of patrons to the area come night. It was the introduction of that club that opened the area to other less savory businesses. From time to time a patrol car can be seen, coming to look for those women of the night that are rumored to linger around the corner of the streets every so often.   Obvious exits: Interzone Records IR  Daisy has arrived. Daisy walks into the record store. Daisy has left. Compton has arrived. You walk into the record store. Interzone Records - Main Room          Everything used to be something else, and Interzone Records used to be a bowling alley. Some traces of the original layout remain: the sunken floor, the shoe counters where the cash registers now sit, and most notably, the wide open spaces where the lanes once were, now filled with row after row of CD's and records, sorted by genre and artist.         The walls are a testament to Erin's Vale's rich history as a stop on the Pacific Northwest touring circuit. They're covered from floor to ceiling in psychedelic-inspired posters, from cracked and fading Fleetwood Mac and Pink Floyd tours, to recently-printed memorabilia from The White Stripes and The Donnas. Just as the walls are covered in posters, so the counters and record bins are plastered with stickers, in some cases several layers deep, covering the history of punk rock, from The Ramones and Stiff Little Fingers, to bands that are still practicing in the garage.         Near the counters, a small alcove has been devoted entirely to local bands, showcasing their music and littered with advertising fliers for local nightclubs, bars, music halls, and theaters - any place with a stage.         Over the sound system, there is music playing. Always.                  *Places and +views available* Contents: Daisy Enid Obvious exits: Side Door    Out   Compton walks in off of the street. Compton has arrived.  In a way, all used record stores have certain things in common. They're covered in posters. They're covered in band stickers. The Violent Femmes play on the sound system. There's a little punk girl with strangely-colored hair in the aisles, bopping along to the music while she returns CD's to their appropriate bins.  They descend like plagues of locusts, Daisy and her ilk do, and don't let up until they've shoplifted or purchased every last goddamn copy of _ROCKET TO RUSSIA_. And so, locust-like, Daisy and her ilk decend, though today's ilk -- Compton and Penny -- suggest that she's a gutterpunk, rather than a high school punk. She wanders up and down the aisles, not purchasing anything in particular but, rather, maneuvering so as to allow Enid no possible line of sight that encompasses Penny, Compton, and herself.  They're clever that way.  Though the probable cameras render it entirely moot. Daisy and Penny walk in side by side, the former ahead of the later. Must've been her idea. So Penny tosses her cigarette outside while Compton's got the door. She follows Daisy down aisle ten, boots skidding on the unwaxed floor. She turns a shoulder to the stacks, flips through some cds in the dollar bin and yawns.  "What're we supposed to be looking for?"  It's asked of Compton while she de-lints her pockets. The old guy, slips in last and quickly busies himself in the vynil section.  "Judas Preist, the one they sued em' for in court. You know, like the actualy exhibit A one..."   One second he's at Blue Oyster Cult, then another on the opposite wall at the Dead section and then again at the Jimmy Bufett row. His presence is slippery, moving in and out of your attention like a lazy trout in your mind. It's not that he actually disapears, you just simply manage to miss him.  Friends don't let friends shoplift The Ramones. Enid isn't looking, of course. She twists on the balls of her feet as if putting out a couple of cigarettes while she returns albums to their rightful place in Rock Music, A-M. She pops a great big bubble of pink gum and chews it loudly, though not so loudly that it can be heard over the music.  "Dude. P-dogg."  P-dogg must refer to Penny, because it's in that directly that Daisy's facing, and it's in that direction that Penny's not responding. Maybe the music's too loud. She repeats:  "Dude. P-dogg."  She's holding up a fine example of the contents of Aisle 10: a spoken word album whose album cover depicts William S. Burroughs' drooping features looking askance at an incogruous swirl of Technicolor. The album's title is so psychedelic as to be unreadable.  "Did you get Hiro a Christmas present this year?"  Cornelius walks in off of the street. Cornelius has arrived.  The record store is positively crowded. The Violent Femmes segue into The Velvet Underground, with Lou Reed singing "Sweet Nothin'" in his cracked and ruined voice. Enid hum along, with great enthusiasm and little talent, when she's not popping her gum. Her hands are kept busy returning CD's to their bins.  "Thought he was some kinda Buddhist..." Compton perks up from behind a crate of Steely Dan. The door to the music store swings open. A very wet old man bearing a strong resemblence to a drown cat steps inside the shop. "Ach... it is cold out there." Cornelius observes keenly. Momentarily dazed and confused by the visually blinding display of psychadelic 'art', he blinks his eyes, shaking his head. "My god..." Murmurs, turning immediately to a display.  l Cornelius         This is an older man. Slight, sort of frail looking. Top of his head has a sort of dusty look to it. In truth it's just what remains of his white hair clinging to his bald head in light little whisps. Ice blue eyes are behind wire rimmed glasses. Skin is pale white, wrinkled, looks almost like paper. Cheeks are lightly tinted red, just a bit of color there. Nose is hooked, downwards and his lips are thin, set in a line of disapproval.         Slender, scarecrow-like body appears to be loosely clad. The shirt is a plain blue dress shirt with a golden green tie that hangs down in front. The pants are light cotton dress pants, a black color, neatly pressed looking. Shoes are nice but kind of scuffy looking. Carries a cane in his left hand. Ebony with a silver cap in the shape of a smiling woman's head.  "Yeah," says Daisy, drowning out Lou Reed, "he was some sort of Buddhist, on account of it having something to do with his Japanese ancestry, and then he pretty much dropped that in favor of something what I don't know what it is."  Dextrous fingers busy themselves in the racks. It's apparent (now that she's attracting attention) that she's not shoplifting -- she's interweaving CDs from her purse with CDs on the rack.  That's right, P-dogg isn't paying attention. Her fingers are tracing across an Anti-Flag section, staring intently at the back of the cd zoning out. "Daz-ee baby, slow down," Daisy's getting much too far ahead of Penny "there's totally no cameras here" catches her eye just then, implies there couldn't be "it just wouldn't make economical sense. Surveillance in a bowling alley? Do you know how much space there really is here? I mean have you ever seen what goes on behind the pin machines? Me and this guy once, you remember Johnny Irish?"   A clear, shining example of the kind of person that hangs around in record stores. She's rocked, talking a mile a minute with no end in sight. "Well Johnny and I got into this thing one night after Jesse roped the wrong guy,.." Penny's still holding that cd at a strangely conversational angle "like that guy? Daisy - like that guy," pointing at Cornelius "only black and he had kindof a gut." How the guy in the story relates to the guy in the store is anyone's guess - it makes sense to Penny, so she continues "Anyway so the point is we had to get outta the bar so we walked through an alley and ducked in this door, but like we had no idea where it went and it was the scariest.shit.ever."  Enid is certainly an odd little creature. She returns a handfull of Misfits albums to their rightful place, then moves up the aisle for Leonard Cohen. "Mr. Shobaz!" she calls out to the old man, once he's recovered from the former bowling alley's bright interior decorating scheme. "I wasn't sure you ever left your waxworks!" She glances sidelong at Daisy and waves Leoard Cohen's 'The Future' in a way that isn't the least bit threatening. "We've got a whole section over by the counter for local bands," she says. Chew. Pop. Chew. "Or yu can just leave 'em at the counter and we'll sort 'em properly."  "Hardly ever Nid, hardly ever. But I had some shopping to do. I recalled that you sold... records here. So I wanted to see what kind." Looking around slowly, a wry smile touches his features. "Nothing that I would imagine that I would listen to." Observing the others in the shop, he pauses looking at Daisy, as if he recognizes her before looking back to Enid. "Can you reccomend something?"  Laughter comes from Compton, now over at the 'C's and digging in to the Clash. Apparently the thought of local hillbillies mashing instruments being to Daisy's liking to be... unlikely. "Right. Well," Daisy says, voice wavering sheepishly before it finds its strength. "We ain't exactly local, having just moved, as we did, from San Francisco and then to Toronto, and then after that to right here. I guess as I don't have to be sneaking them into the racks anymore.   Hand goes in purse; hand comes up with gum; gum goes in mouth, then back again for a CD, which she tosses underhand in Enid's general direction.  "Anyway. Yeah. We're the Invisible College. Not to diss on my man Lou, but you could throw that on, if it happens that you want to." She turns back to the racks. "I suppose I'll clean up your racks, then."  Enid weaves out of Rock A-M, passing Compton at 'C,' where she makes approving noises of his taste in music, assuming that loud bubble gum popping sounds are approval. The cocks her head to the side as she attempts to read the old man. "Classical? Like, Verdi or Vivaldi or some other Italian guy? Wagner? Not that Wanger's Italian, but," she gives a vague little wave of dismissal. "Jazz? Kletzmer? There's this band called the Kletzmatics that...well...you've gotta hear 'em." She snatches Daisy's CD out of the air with her free hand. "Thanks," she grins at the gutterpunk. "We'll make you a proper label and file you under Local and Rock I. You gus got any gigs yet, 'cus I've got a promoter friend who's breathin' down my neck for new acts."  The older fellow ponders this for several moments. "I will try... the... ah, Kletz-matics." Cornelius says, thoughtfully, glancing at the others before looking back to Nid. Rowdy kids. Probably going to try to jump him or something outside of the shop. Can't trust most young people. Degenerates, all of them! Penny moves around to where Daisy put down the Burroughs thing and picks it up then surprises everyone; see she WAS keeping up "Christmas, huh." An absent gesture, her hand goes inside her jacket with the cd. She looks down like there's something moving around her feet "...has it been a year already?"  Penny looks a little green.  The smile on Daisy's face is so broad that it has to be put on crooked, half of it jammed up into the little cheek-room she has to spare and the other hanging relatively limply in the corner. It shows off some reasonably poor dentition and ill-considered dental hygeine, but that, if anything, is par for the course.  "It's been a year for most of us, Penny dear," says Daisy, eyes tracking Enid back toward the counter -- she IS going to put that album on. "I dunno how long it's been for you." Enid sends Daisy's album flying across the counter, where it's caught by the red-haired punk working the register. In a few minute, it will be heard over the sound system, depending on what kind of priority the counter boy grants it. Now she waves Cornelius along towards the Folk section and looks around for the Kletzmatics. "They do this sort of funky Eastern European folk music, mostly in Yiddish, at least I think it's Yiddish," she mutters. Chew. Pop. "It sounds kinda like coughing up a hairball."  This gets a raspy chuckle. Cornelius walks over to the section she indicated. Fingers, like dexterous spider legs, click the records along before they slip one from the rack. He studies the front of it, then the back on it. Eyes always on those pesky kids.  Daisy, sotto voce to Penny, eyes rolling as hard as they can: "Euuch. Goyim."  Compton is old, to make a point. Well, much older than the 'kids' he trucks with. As he wanders the store, popping up here and there in his peculiar way it could be noted that he's older than the rock he checks out, older thena the Punk he puruses and older than the crap 60s Folk Music he avoids like the plauge. Each of the eras of music have washed over him like a ocean of Pop culture and yet he remains. Salty and crusty as any sea dog.  Enid looks down at Cornelius in all of her blonde (at the roots, anyway) haired, blue-eyed goyish glory. "I think you'd like it. It's traditional, but it's not like they're all falling asleep while playing their accordions and squeezeboxes and stuff. Todd Ashley was totally listening to this when he started Firewater." She looks expectantly at the much older gentlemen before her face falls and she says, "Umm...forget I said that. It probably doesn't make any sense to you."  "Indeed. It does not." Cornelius grins, moving through the store to the front with the one record. Setting it on the counter, he asks. "How much for the purchase?"  Top priority, of course.  What burst forth from the loudspeaker is not punk. It starts out breakbeat and noise. Noise and something spoken - it rises, tidal, and fades like the undertow - always there but just out of range to be heard. A silvery ting is flipped into the mix, shuddering with the vocal. It's not English. It's not Spanish or anything instantly recognizable - maybe Scandanavian - as a matter of fact it *does* sound a little like Bjork. But then again, maybe not.  Penny ta-ta-tas with the bassline and touches Daisy's elbow and guides her, the beat nodding her head, toward Compton in a very pointed and specific way. Paranoid.  The redheaded clerk at the counter puts on the album: it's always good to have one last-ditch local band to pull out in any musical discussion; something that no one else has ever heard of; something that stops the escalating erudition in its tracks.   The music on the CD isn't what one would expect from Daisy. It's an intricate wash of pop culture -- here and there, you can pick out fragments of jingles from commericals of the 1980s, distorted quotes from old movies, soundtracks running both forward and backward. The vocals, cigarette-roughened and husky, aren't English. The vowel sounds are wrong, and rasping back-of-the throat noises -- as in Hebrew or Arabic -- predominate.  Maybe the vocals are Daisy. It's hard to tell.  In any case, she glides along with Penny, casting a sidelong (and not altogether comfortable) glance at Cornelius. Behind Compton, she stops, peeking out around for another look.    Daisy says, "Ignore the fact that Penny and I pretty much posed the same thing. I'd be damned if I was going to rewrite the whole thing just to avoid redundancy."  The red-headed boy behind the counter rings up Cornelius' order. Enid lags behind, leaning against one of the bins with her head cocked to the side as the music starts. "Hmmmm." Her chewing and popping slows to a near-halt. "Like Halou meets The Sugarcubes. You guys do this kinda thing live or are you strictly a science fair band?"  During the debut listening of the Colleges latest offering, COmpton appears next to Cornelius at he counter with an armfull of Carly Simon records and asks the red headed kid, "Yo, where's the shitter?" in his completely accentless voice of slow death. The kid points to a partially blocked doorway in the back.  Off Compton goes with a spyness in his step that wasn't there before. What? He doesn't like listening to Folk music...  Blindly unaware of any of the interest in him, Cornelius takes out some wrinkled bills, putting them on the counter. Waiting for the boy to give him his change, he glances around the room one more time, observing. Curious.  The red-haired boy makes change for Cornelius under Enid's watchful gaze. The yellow-haired girl rests a hand on her bony hip and glares at the counter boy as if to make sure he does it right. "You got time for me to come by the waxworks tomorrow night, Mr. Shobaz?" she asks. "I've got the night off." It's a store full of music-lovers and gutterpunks and Nid wants to spend her free time with a guy old enough to be her grandfather.  "Totally. Though they're, like, invitation-only, or did we stop doing that, Penny?"  Daisy leans back against the counter, rolling her shoulders in a sort of an approximation of a shrug.   "We got sort of a vibe we're generally going for. And we usually only throw parties to premiere a new piece. Hiro comes up with them, mostly, and Jesse mixes."  Penny looks dead-on at Cornelius; she's very clearly on something. It's an extreme stare - wide eyes and bitten lip. Because she thought it was an aside, Penny asides back "We stopped until," and she makes this hand gesture; a complicated riff on sign language. Daisy should translate for the curious.  Penny looks greener.  "It would be quite acceptable Nid. We can start with the basics." Cornelius turns and meets Penny's gaze. Offers her a grin that might be friendly. But what are the chances of that. And it's gone. "See you tomorrow. I have procured the tools you will need." Holding the CD, Cornelius makes his way for the door. To the lovely outside.  It isn't ASL. It does, however, seem to remind Daisy.  "We stopped until Monday turned to Saturday again. It's some kind of ritual inversion or sommat, right?, where maybe the public sphere becomes private and whatever?"  Grinning at Enid, not having bought anything yet, she makes for the door, Penny in tow.  Penny probably doesn't realize it but the Burroughs cd is still in her hand. And as an anchor to Daisy, she can not help but be pulled by gravity in the direction she leads. Technically Compton should be leaving with them but he's ..still in the bathroom. And who knows how long old men really take.  Cornelius walks out of the record store and onto the street. Cornelius has left. Enid has disconnected.  ~FIN~

      Interzone Records - Main Room(#1937RhJM)           Everything used to be something else, and Interzone Records used to be a bowling alley. Some traces of the original layout remain: the sunken floor, the shoe counters where the cash registers now sit, and most notably, the wide open spaces where the lanes once were, now filled with row after row of CD's and records, sorted by genre and artist.          The walls are a testament to Erin's Vale's rich history as a stop on the Pacific Northwest touring circuit. They're covered from floor to ceiling in psychedelic-inspired posters, from cracked and fading Fleetwood Mac and Pink Floyd tours, to recently-printed memorabilia from The White Stripes and The Donnas. Just as the walls are covered in posters, so the counters and record bins are plastered with stickers, in some cases several layers deep, covering the history of punk rock, from The Ramones and Stiff Little Fingers, to bands that are still practicing in the garage.          Near the counters, a small alcove has been devoted entirely to local bands, showcasing their music and littered with advertising fliers for local nightclubs, bars, music halls, and theaters - any place with a stage.          Over the sound system, there is music playing. Always.   So it's late enough to be awake but too early for four-twenty, so Hiro's actually out and about. The cops are all over the east side right now, so he's not loitering in the slums, and there's no way he'd venture into the western half of Erin's vale. So - somehow, following mention of a twenty-four hour peep show from a phone booth to a bowling alley from a flyer in the gutter to somehow ending up here: Pigboy slouches through the entrance, the strap of his record bag digging into his shoulder, face ruddy from the cold and the wind.  On your typical Wednesday afternoon, Interzone Records is a bit crowded, with plenty of high schoolers looking to spnd their hard-earned allowance money on music. A red-haired boy is standing at the counter, checking bags in exchange for playing cards. A great big middle-aged biker stands at the register, ringing up orders, while Enid stands between the aisles with an armload of CD's, returning them to their appropriate bins. The sound system plays Soul Coughing, and the yellow-haired girl sings along to "Screen Writer's Blues" while she returns Iggy Pop and BT where they belong. "It is five am," she drawls, "And you are listening to Los Angeles."  Back of a hand scrubbed across his nose. Hiro sniffs once, sharply, and balls hands up in coat pockets; slipping through a knot of teenagers clogging the entrance. Progress into the depths of the store is slow, cautious: a nervous, furtive animal searching unfamiliar territory. Past banks of CDs - beneath garish displays - through crowds of kids - then, finally, down a specific aisle, side-to-side flicker of attention, eyes darting across dust jackets and labels.  A gutterpunk - two-hundred dollar boots, shaved head, pockets full of spare change - starts to slip a CD under his jacket while Enid's back is turned. With the same sixth sense granted to teachers that allows them to decipher just who threw tha spitball, the yellow-haired girl turns around and tell him, "You're _so_ gonna put that back, 'cus I'm not gonna buy it back off of you when you bring it by next week." The gutterpunk grumbles, the CD is returned, and Enid tactfully wanders off into the electronica section, still humming just a little off-key.  And, yeah, maybe Hiro isn't totally dissapointed. Because an initially cursory examination catches, snags: Pigboy slows down as something catches his eye. Backtracks. There's a certain obsessive fugue that makes people like him distinct: he doesn't notice the erstwhile thief, the failed theft - really, everything other than the tips of his fingers and the records passing beneath them exists on a frequency he's just not tuned in to. He's hunched forward like quasimodo by the time Enid breezes through his section -- scrutinizing a release from some obscure breakbeat label.  Every major city has at least one record store like Interzone. The aisles are studded with little recommendation cards from the staff. Buy this. Buy that. So-and-so is listening to this right now and it kicks ass. The breakbeat section encompasses everything from Electro Funk to Two-Step Garage, with notes scribbled in the margins about the pros and cons of various sub-genres. "Kidneythieves," Enid says as she passes the pig-boy. "You need to pick up every Thidneythieves album ever."  Some internal filter clicks, in the way that somehow even totally zoned people can pick up that they're being addressed when they don't seem to be paying attention to shit. Hiro looks up, then back: over his shoulder, thumb to glasses, nudging them up the bridge of his nose. A flash of scrutiny - enough to fill out a police blotter - and then back to the records. "Breaks?" he asks, rotating the record right-side-up, tugging it free from its nest. Flip-around: scrutinizing the tiny print across the back. "Never heard of'm."  Enid riffles through the vinyl, returning a few more albums to their appropriate places, plucking out errant artists who have wandered from their appointed genres - a yellow-haired angel of order. "Progressive breaks, yeah. They're a band outta LA. They played here last March an' kicked ass. Packed the house."  Hiro makes a noise - something in the neighborhood of acquiescence. The record he was examining seems to have passed muster: it goes under his arm, even as his attention drifts down to the 'K's. "Big following, like?" he asks, shuffling-edging sideways towards the mentioned target. A thumb seperates a sheaf of records in half, and he lowers his head for further examination. "On the lookout, right? 'slike nobody digs breakbeats anymore."  Enid shrugs, popping a stick of gum into her mouth. She chews loudly, blowing great big pink bubbles on occasion. "Beats the hell outta bands tryin' to sound like Suicide Commando, which is all we're gettin' in Industrial these days." Chew. Pop. Sure enough, the Kidneythieves albums have staff-written recommendations all over them, written in nearly undecipherable scrawls. "Cowpunchers has a breaks night these days, so there's a local market for it, but all the good tuff's comin' outta California."  Hiro looks back, again: squints. "You gotta be scammin'," he mumbles. "There's gotta be some kinda natural law against mixin' electronic music and mechanical bulls." Pluck from amidst the records: attention shifts back, and Piggy scrutinizes the hand-written notes, attempting to decipher a meaning from the hieroglyphics. "Which one you think's the most danceable?"  Enid leans across the bin and examines the half dozen or so Kidneythieves albums available at the moment, then plucks one out of the pile and holds up aloft. "This one - Trickster. It's their first album, an' I still think it's their best one. If you want to get another one, get Zerospace, which has a bunch of good remixes on it, but if you're tryin' to introduce a dancefloor to a new band, you wanna go with the original stuff first."  "Dig," acknowledges Hiro. He looks up as the sound of heavy rain creeps up like interference behind the background music: mumbles something decidedly impolite. The album is accepted, joining the other record already under his arm. "Thanks for the tip." Pause. "You know a lot of party kids around here, any chance? We just kinda rolled into town - need crew."  The red-headed kid behind the counter flips the bird at the rain pounding on the sidewalk and simply turns the sound system up. It becomes a little more difficult to talk, but Enid simply raises her voice. Loud music is a fact of life at Interzone. "It's the usual setup. We're up to our ears in party kids. Fuck, just about every loser with a set of Technics is a DJ. But if you put up a flier in the local section," she points towards a niche near the front counter. "People'll show up."  "Yeah, and so will every narc and gangbanger with a bust quota to make or some eezy to unload." Sideways flicker of attention, then back. Flash of teeth. "Thanks for the recommendation, anyway." Index and middle finger in a broad 'V', and he's heading for the counter with his rekkids.  Enid answers Hiro's peace sign by blowing a great big pink bubble that nearly obscures her face. Pop. Then she turns and gets back to work. Over the sound system, the red-headed boy plays Johnny Cash covering Nine Inch Nails. The biker is happy. Enid is not, at least if her suggestion that the red-deaded boy's mother prefers sex with the dead is any indication.

      Hiro slouches in his seat. This is not indicative of boredom, or uneasiness, or intoxication -- part of what defines 'Hiro' as 'Hiro' is simply that he slouches. An ashtray balances precariously on his chair's left arm, full of cigarette butts and ash and roaches and bottlecaps, overflowing to the critical mass point, teetering on the brink of a mess Daisy will have to clean up, because it's Daisy's job and Hiro is Friday and Hiro does whatever he damn well pleases, thank you very much.    He hits the joint, greasy brown with resin, and passes it to the right, to Penny. His eyes are fixed on the dome dominating the coffee table, an antique stock ticker liberated from eBay.    "We gonna do this?" he asks Penny.  Penny has her legs kicked over the right arm of her chair. She could be touching heads with Hiro if she were high. Taking the joint from him, she inhales a few times, cough-talking "We-gon-na-do-this," snorts smoke out her nose.    How the Invisible College got their hands on one of the first Edison Universal Stock Printers, on ebay no less, was definitely due in some part to Pobble's ever expanding collection of connections; amazing what money will buy. Penny, glazed but interested, can't take her eyes off the thing - a victorian masterpiece of brass, mahogany and a large roll of spooled white paper - "..it looks like an upended turn-table, really" she continues some internal monologue outwardly "and when we ask it to, the spirit will turn over the gears and .." she passes the joint back.    "Listen up," puts her fingers on the plaque, covering someone's name obscenely-wealthy-at-one-point. Who she's talking to isn't quite clear "Tap that little thing over there." Maybe she meant Hiro. 'That Little Thing' is the paper-forwarder. "You should try talking to them, ..it, with me, y'know?"    Hiro says, "Ok, is there any specific system for describing rotes here?"   Hiro says, "Like how we should break it down or something?"   Quiet says, "You can describe it to me now. I've not seen one yet. I assumed there wasn't but that is a failure on my part. I'll check with Oblivion."   Hiro says, "OK. We're using the stock ticker as a kind of ouija board. It's a relic -- a symbol of power just because of it's antiquity. We've wired it right into the fuse box. A computer microphone -- one of those cheap plastic boom mics people use for dictation and like net teleconferencing -- is wired directly into the current, and the ticker has a fresh roll of paper. It's two-way communication, so we can speak to it and it can respond through the stock ticker. We're trying to contact the largest, oldest electricity spirit in residence -- the big one, the one Hiro's already nicknaming 'Old Man General Electric'. The big kahuna that was in charge of the generators. The idea is that the ticker acts as a beacon, to draw the spirit in to speak to us."  Quiet pages: Thats fine. Two of you pose the beginning. Then make the first roll. Then the second pose. Then a second roll. Using anything to modify the DC of your roll?  Slouched in his high-backed chair, Hiro gives something like mumbled assent; exhaling a viscous cloud of marijuana smoke. He straightens, or at least tilts his slouch forward: laying fingertips against the edge of the stock ticker. Eyes close half-way, either from concentration or intoxication. He clears his throat, taking this very seriously -- steampunk telegraph machine his own postmodernist ouija board.  Hiro rolls arete (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:          Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  The paper moves inch by inch, threading itself through the mechanism to make contact with the two alphanumeric wheels. Penny sits back and takes the joint from Hiro again, tokes.  She exhales over the dome, then the perspective changes dramatically. The smoke seems to displace itself inside the glass dome and expand it outward, super-imposing and image of itself the full width of the table. Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:     -1- 2  Achieving 0 successes, resulting in a failure Penny watches the dome, stunned to a more upright position "That wasn't supposed to happen."  The air slowly takes on a charged feeling. Like the sense before a storm, the tingling of the static in the air of electricity looming in the distance.  "Hsst," Hiro hisses through his teeth, all don't-anger-the-spirits touchy about this shit. Maybe his favorite porn site was down this morning. A deep breath, released through bared-clenched teeth... which Pigboy didn't brush this morning. Fingers splay out, pinkie to index spread across the rim of the machine's base. "Imagination at work," he recites, enunciating each syllable carefully. No, no sanskrit, no forbidden languages. Corporate slogans.  Hiro rolls arete (3 dice) at a difficulty of 6:   4 3 -1-  Achieving -1 successes, resulting in a botch!    Quiet winces. At least it's a 0.   Hiro says, "Yeah :b"   Hiro says, "smoking dope and invoking forbidden powers. I don't see how we're going wrong.."   Quiet says, "Now all you need is some hideous Lovecraftian book."  "Would you fucking concentrate? Fuck, man fucking thing maxed out Pobble's Centurion for the quarter.." - of course, he doesn't know that yet, she asides "don't tell him, okay. Okay. Okay okay" her best Joe Pesci "just let it happen, right?" She closes her eyes and lowers her chin to her chest; not quite zen but it'll do.  [Willpower] Penny spends a Willpower point. Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 6:   5      Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.    Quiet says, "That would give us a total of six unless I can't count."   Hiro nods.  It happens again; a ghost of the ticker expanding outward toward Penny and Hiro - and then past them. Past the table and the down to the floor, the image increasing overhead like a projection until it loses all resolution.  Penny reaches out into the space in front of her, chipped nail polish throwing off points of light, like morse code. "Do you see it yet?"  Eyes flicker shut, open slowly. Hiro snatches his hands back from the machine as if shocked: fingertips rubbing together, fidgeting. He kipes the half-smoked joint from Penny, takes a long hit to 'center himself'. Exhale, a long narrow stream. Tone formal, offering the weed back to his partner in crime:          "Lord of Turbines," he murmurs. "We offer praise. Who brings illumination, driving out ignorance? Who drives civilization? Who powers our city, steam, fire, and current?" Pause. "Tell us your name, that we might return to you what is yours, that your wires might live again, that the machines might sing your praise."   The feeling of static in the air continues to build as the charge grows. From the microphone you can hear what sounds like interferance coming through. A faint whine comes from the speaker, must be really bad reception from the otherside. Slowly your hair begins to stand on end. "Who.... summons...." Comes a crackling voice from the microphone. Small metal objects slowly begin to slide to larger ones as the feeling intensifies. Outside you can hear a rumble of thunder.   "I... am.... Arcer." The crackling, staticy voice has the sound of a voice rusted from disuse.  Fuck. Hiro doesn't remember all the right honorifics. He's read too many comic books and not enough hermetic texts. But he's winging it, right? If John Constantine can bind the lord of plagues, he can make a deal with a generator. "The Invisible College seeks barter," he says, quietly. "We wish to return to you the glory that was once yours. Your turbines are full of dust, your wires silent, your home under the sway of foreign current. We would make the city's power lines yours again." Pigboy looks at Penny sidelong - like, do I sound pompous enough? Is this flying?  Totally pompous. Penny gives Hiro a look like he's just in from outerspace "Hello Arcer," fingers twitching til she makes fists on the table, reflexively chatting like it's a regular sort of phonecall "I'm Penny and that's Hiro. We're part of The Invisible College and if you don't have anything better to do, we'd like to invite you to stay with us." She looks up, briefly, to check the status of her hair-on-end "..provided you can find some way to not charge the air around us all the time."   "Ahhh..." The voice comes, carrying the hollow echo of a metal chamber that is empty with the faint crackle of electricity. "The turbines.... they are silent... I... I have been sleeping.... for a long time...." It does, indeed, sound almost like an old man. A confused, sleepy one, but an old man. The thundering outside settles down but the static electricity and magnetism can still be felt in here. "Where... where have the men gone... who shall tend the turbines... who shall check the wires and monitor my gauges..." There is a thunk as the televisions suspended by chains bang against each other.  "Everything is wrong... they left... Home Office... orders. Why will you do this?" It asks, confused tone becoming curiosity.   Hiro's questioning look turns into a frown. He was feeling very Hermetic for a moment. Clears his throat, returning his attention to the ticker. "The.. uhm, details." Pause. "Well, Arcer. They no longer believed in you. They left a long time ago. We do believe in you: we'd like to see you prosper. We've made this place our home, and we'd like you to do what you've always done. We'll help you - we'll give you back the city's wires, turn your turbines back on, repair the place so you can do what you're meant to do. In return, all we want is for you to look after us like you looked after the others. Only we won't abandon you like they did."  Another look with Penny. Under his breath: "That better? Jeeze."  You say, "The price of progress, Arcer" Penny explains further giving Hiro the nod, still convivial - chatty when she's high "the men left when their methods became obsolete. But now we're here. There are seven of us but we're not like the men that left. We can restore you to a purposeful existance," she lowers her voice, eggs on "We can give you a strength they never could. Do you want that?"  "Strength...?" The voice rises in inflection, the word rolls out on the waves of static through the microphone. "Yes... I had strength once... before they left. They abandoned me..." Your hair rises up more now as the spirit becomes more aroused. "More efficient... generation methods... turbines... not worth replacing... operating costs too high..." It recites as if snippets of the past flash back from its memories. "Agghh.... they abandoned Arcer! I served them.... and they broke the covenant!" Everything in the room is charged up now as everything arcs off to everything else. Even yourselves. Not dangerously so... just odd. You can tell it is upset.  Hiro lights a fresh cigarette: hands -- just barely shaking, controlled -- cupped around the tip, cheap dayglo-orange bic flashing butane blue. Flare of the cherry in the ill-lit room. "Arcer," he murmurs, plucking the smoke from between his lips, exhaling with the words. Keep cool. "We ain't interested in efficiency. We're interested in you. Fuck them, man--" So much for formal language and high ritual. "--bottom line hounds, dig? They don't know shit about shit." Pointed jab with his cigarette's tip, to drive the point home. "We're here to make a new deal."  Penny subvocalizes to Piggy "Say something nice to it now." She settles back into her chair and digs around in both pockets of her jacket. Tugging out papers and a dime, she kicks her feet back up and starts the process of rolling again. "Tell it about the parties we throw and what kind of energy we require." She's utterly relaxed, in her element. This is her thing and educating Piggy is the most fun she's had in weeks. "Stay cool, just be cool. hard part's over."  "New... deal.... A new contract." It's voice suddenly surges. "I will re... renegociate with new owners." Arcer finally replies, the static level dropping rapidly so that it's only slightly abnormal in here now instead of Dr. Frankenstein's Lab. "What are the terms...?"  Hiro looks, again, to Penny: she's rolling a joint and he's on his own. He taps ash onto the mouldering pile and leans forward, elbows propped on his knees. "You help us, we help you, Arcer. We make this place run again, we keep it running, we give you access to the greater city." Nova-flare of the cigarette in the flickering light; will-o-wisp trail as the cherry drops. Tobacco and marijuana smoke hang in the air in a haze. "You give us power, you keep us safe, you listen and watch to what happens in your world and keep us posted. It's like..." Pause. "Like a symbiotic relationship."  "Ah..." The crackling voice responds after a long period of silence. "I will... consider this offer..." The voice echoes a bit in the speaker. "Bring me.... bring me copper. I wish to taste fresh copper... five pounds... bring this tomorrow. And I will bring my answer."  ...and Hiro, Hiro's grinning like the cat that got the canary. Or the pig that ate the truffle. Or whatever. "You got it Arcer," he answers.  The static feeling is all but gone now. "I will go.... and don't forget... to turn lights off... when you're not using them... don't waste energy..." And then, as it came, so it is gone.

      Old GE Plant - The Invisible Loft       Skylights[1] flank a high, peaked roof, mirrored surfaces reflecting washes of neon and blacklight in mingling pools across the ground below. No natural light reaches this place - it exists independent of the cycles and systems of the world outside, time distorted to the infinite now of a dexedrine binge.      The area is dominated by a circle of seven high-backed chairs[2], surrounding a low coffee table[3]. Twin televisions hang from the roof by heavy iron chains - tilted at an angle to bathe each half of the ring in the warm glow of artificial reality.      Curling womblike around the periphary, the majority of the floor has been sealed off behind an amorphous plastic shell: bulbous and twisted as if exposed to immense heat, with a hue varying from embryotic pinkish-red to mouldy green. Veins of fiber optic cable run through the shell, a circulatory system in pulsating blue and purple. Piles of bedding[4] cling to the walls at irregular intervals. A solitary airlock[5] is the only access to the laboratory without.      Beyond the curving walls, the magic happens. Machinery once found on the factory floor has been reconstructed in bizarre mechanical simulacra[6]. Cabinets and work surfaces bear the dull oxidized finish of refurnished metal - a slick, glossy sheen drawing uncomfortable aesthetic parallels to an animal's organs. Plastic, metal, and glass tubing snake through the whole: an interconnecting network linking the machines.                  [Footnoted +views set.]  Contents:  Obvious exits: Library    Closet    Exit    Keene is sitting in his given chair around the coffee table, tapping intently at a PDA. A cigarette idles between his lips as he sets up his schedule for the next several days, taking note of several key lunch meetings.         "I need to find a good dry cleaners," he mumbles to himself, tapping at the sketch area and circling that part of his schedule.  There is a strange little high pitch singing noise in the air before a small, bright purple imp appears near where Keene is sitting. Of course. Messenger imp. Flashy.          The Hermetic pauses in his PDA-tapping when he hears the familiar singing noise. Being trained around Bonsagius magi makes one accustomed to old-fashioned ways of communication. Saving his progress and turning off the PDA, Keene leans forward when he sees the imp.         "Hello," he directs to it, putting the device back within his coat. "how may I help you today?"  "Greetings to you Keene, from Master Bartius of Seattle." The imp bows low to Keene. "Master Bartius sends me to express concerns that he has. An apprentice member of his Chantry came to Erin's Vale to visit family. And she has disappeared here. The good Master suspects that she may be dead for he can not reach her. Could you do Master Bartius a favor, see if you can locate the apprentice?" The imp inquires of Keene          "Of course," says Keene, automatically straightening up when he hears the word `Master' in Bartius' title. "I'll need her file, of course, but I can set to work on finding her right away afterward."  "Very well! She was here for the holiday. There is not too much you should need from us. But here is her file... with picture." The purple imp says, producing a file from thin air, offering it to Keene. "Any help you can provide will be appreciated. You will hold the Master in your dept." The imp bows again and vanishes. A faintly bad smell remains. Stupid imp jokes.

And Penny BANGS out the door and declares “I’m going out.”  Something something about Hiro in a chair hooked up to something with wires, pants around his ankles, a roll of pennies in his mouth. He, too, declares “I wanna come.”  Something else like: Penny says “So come,” sly? Did she know what he was up to? Hmm. “Nobody’s stopping you.” She fiddles with the door. Something something about the other magic word, KET, to open the door.   Nothing happens.  Penny looks up at the uncooperative door. Her eyes move from edge to edge, then spots it "Who set the deadbolt?" Hiro loses the wires and pulls up his pants, fiddling unsuccessfully with his belt. He looks up at the question, and promptly looks away. "I didn't want to be interrupted," he answers coyly, stripping off the rubber gloves.

Hiro makes his way into the Cowpunchers. Hiro has left. You make your way into the Cowpunchers. Cowpunchers - Main Room(#1194RIJMs)          Loud country music assails the senses, issuing forth from a jukebox in the corner. Leaning over the bar next to the door must be 'the newcomer', a man around 55 years old. He's usually cleaning the bar with a rag when he's not drawing a beer from the taps in front of him. The usual liquors are available on the shelfs behind him, reflected in the mirror that says "Cowpunchers" with a red hat tipping up in a ya-hoo move over a lassoo.          Weekday evenings, this bar is filled with older men, having a sociable drink before going on home to the wife. But on weekends the place fills up with the factory workers relaxing before the dreaded work week comes once more. At these times it gets rowdy, when the cowboys that still live on the ranches to the east of here clash with the factory workers. Most fights wind up on the street, out of respect to the owner's age, but occasionally the cops have to be called in.

Obvious exits: Cowpunchers    North on Lynx    East on Jones    West on Jones   Hiro comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Hiro has arrived.  Alabaster Smith comes into the area from the east. Alabaster Smith has arrived.  Hiro *zzzp*: he's tugging on the zipper of his pants, having just christened the entrance to Cowpunchers to express his disdain for the locked door. The closest bar in town, and they lock the doors. Lam-O. "You got a cigarette, Penny?" he asks, turning away from the offending establishment.  Alabaster Smith is just in time to catch that interesting little act as he wanders down the street. An eyebrow quirks.  Penny pats herself down. Jacket pockets first; outside, inside. Jeans. Breast pocket. Nothing. Then she digs around in that bag of hers. "Lucky you," Penny tugs out a silver cigarette case; hard to miss what glitters on the outside - the initials VAV. Flips the case to Hiro and digs around for matches or something, finds something else instead. The way her hand slows, stops and tenses sends out the 'wrong' vibe "The fu- I swear to god if that fucking monkey's been in my bag..."  Alabaster Smith seems, it might seem, to have been headed for Cowpunchers, but his attention is diverted by the unusual pair, who he studies in some brief detail.  Hiro pauses, cigarette case snapped open, fingers poised in mid-air. He gives Penny a sidelong look, shows teeth. He's the only one that seems to get a kick out of the chimpanzee. Looks away, then, to hide the expression - busines himself with fitting a cigarette between his lips, patting himself down for a lighter. Snap - there's one, flourescent orange bic. Spark - flash - inhale.  Penny stops, pulls her hand out - clean. "You're so fucking sexy Piggy," walks up to him, takes the lit cig from his mouth while he stands there, electric in some way. His charisma goes a long way with her, it would seem. So right. Penny walks up to him, steals his smoke and fixes his pants and shirt for him. Buckles his belt. Puts a hand through his hair.  None of this is sisterly.  "What'd they say when you went in?"  Alabaster Smith quirks an eyebrow again. "Pardon me," he calls. "Is the establishment closed, or are y'all just hanging out?" He's got one of those Deep South accents you can scrape roadkill off the grill with.  "Barn party. Livestock, no pants, bad scene." Hiro directs this at Smith, over Penny's shoulder. Simultaneous response, like. His hair doesn't improve with Penny's ministrations - it's a lost cause. "Heypennsygrabthefortyouttamybag," he mumbles, jerking a thumb over his shoulder. Hiro pages: record bag. No records. A forty ouncer and a zip-lock bag full of pills and powders.  Clearly Hiro's hands are useless. Or useful but only in a very specific manner for a very specific task. Penny circles him, cigarette burning down in her mouth, works the knot out of the twist-ties keeping the record bag closed on his back. She tugs and tugs. And tugs. Gets her hands down in it, small rattling, plasticky rustling noises slither down the uplifted glass fourty ounce-er. She keeps her hand in the bag, murmurs something into his ear.  Alabaster Smith watches the Hiro and Penny, expression amused yet mostly neutral. "Ah see. A barn party. Hmm. Pity, Ah was hoping to save some souls and get a drink."  "Blue goes down, red goes up, yellow goes sideways." Hiro reaches back - plucking the cigarette from between her fingers. Hits it, long and hard. Exhale around the words: "The rest's self-explanatory." He beams inexplicably at Alabaster - ashing his smoke in the gutter. "You wanna hit the forty, preacher?" Penny and Hiro are to the left of the door to Cowpunchers. Penny is smoking even though Hiro has his hand out, waiting for that cigarette to be returned. Her hands are otherwise occupied, a fourty in one and the other deep in his record bag. Her mouth couldn't be closer to his ear otherwise she'd burn him.  "So I says to 'r, I says... Ma'... don' bother me now, man, I got my headgear on..." To avoid having their conversation rained out by this abysmal weather, Pobble and Cash are sticking close to the sides of buildings. They approach in a conversational gate, Cash getting wet away from the protection of Pobble's super villain umbrella. He walks head down, watching his feet tromp through puddles in the production of micro tidal-waves. Cash continues the end of his antic dote trailing his fingers over the memory of his orthopedics aids.  Pobble strolls. Or rather, he would stroll were he not king pimpin' and combat booted. So its more of a strut. Well. It would be a strut if he weren't so obviously wasted. Lets call it swaggering. All S's, so lets call him shitfaced. Pupils agape, if they were mouths they would be the mouths of persons who had just seen the ghosts of their long dead parents, agape, all slack jawed. The irises have given up hope and gone into hiding. A cigarette dangles precariously from a thin lip as if stuck there with superglue. Another cigarette clings for dear life to his begloved silver tipped fingers. The umbrella is held waveringly, the black and white alternating segments twisting around through some wrist action chicanery.  Alabaster Smith smiles broadly at Hiro. "That's a generous offer, Brother, but Ah shall pass for the moment. Get me started on preachin' and Ah might need it later."  Hiro continues to drag on his imaginary cigarette - only, hey, now it's real - Penny's a thief and Hiro's smoking all her cigarettes. The attractive silver case drops into his pocket. Fresh flash of butane flame, flashed peace sign at the approaching duo. "Oi, assholes," he greets.  Penny hasn't seen Pobble or Cash yet, isn't even aware that the cigarette's gone - must be holding her breath or something. She tugs him and the bag back into the uncovered light outside the door to the bar. "Nnnsweet. I need.." She palms something out of his bag, pockets it and lets go of the straps.  Under the thin awning, Penny sneezes. She puts the other hand back in her bag, digs.  Hang Loose. Loose indeed, since the gesticulation brings about the downfall of the tragically fated cigarette between Pobble's fingers. Appropriately the finger-formation is replaced with a request for another cigarette. Brain catches up with reality, and fingers find the substitute cigarette on the lips. It is removed, after a long last-cigarette-on-earth drag. The rain-pearled umbrella toting yeti flashes a most charming smile as he moves with his companion to stand near the dastardly duo outside Cowpunchers. "Good evening, my droogan brothers. And sister." As he says the latter, he eyes Penny with a strange look. It's about half a mile away from enviousness, and three quarters from lust. Pobble taps his nose, and the expression vanishes like Houdini. "What transpires in the shadow of the house of slaughter?" he asks dreamily.  "Far out." Cash throws some fingers in pairs to Hiro and Penny, accompanied by a complicating ghetto sign ending in a *snap*.   "Whadda ya..." The rest of this greeting is interrupted by something square that grabs Cash's attention as his steps have taken him into proximity. Soaked jeans cry when he bends down to pick up said shiny blue square. Flipping the lost BlockBuster's card in his hand, he eyes it as a prize and nods to himself. It ends up back in Pobble's chest, handed over to the space cadet. "We should check into this." He whispers back, then "Whadda ya doin'.... man." for the two loiterers and company.  Echo comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Echo has arrived. Echo steps through a void into the OOC Nexus. Echo has left.  Alabaster Smith watches the others, studying them with a pleasant, unchanging smile, choosing to remain silent for the moment.  So now Hiro has two cigarettes, and he doesn't even notice it. Reality can't be as muddled as his head: teeth bared in a grin, squeaking with grinding-away enamel. Happy birthday. Both smokes wedged between index and middle fingers of the same hand, burning against one another. He jerks backwards at Penny's insistent tugging, stumbles, nearly falls back. Doesn't seem to notice, aside from an untrusting look aimed at the treacherous ground--         --attention snaps up. Fixes, somewhere between Pobble and Cash.  "Reckon them shitheels closed their cow club to us cattle rustlers, pardner," he drawls. Then, in more appropriate english: "So we've taken our sex and drugs to the street, where it belongs." Jon comes into the area from the west. Jon has arrived.  OOC> Jon waits for an idea of the scene before jumping in.  Hiro and Penny are on the doorstep of Cowpunchers. Hiro's smoking two tandem cigarettes: Penny's behind him, rooting through her bag. Pobble and Cash approach across a stretch of asphalt, Smith stands off to one side, scrutinizing. The vibe is manic, crazed, drug and drink fueled.  Penny was eyeing the corner of the building; specifically the darker, more sheltered area. Interrupted. Pobble. Penny moves sideways; away into some shadow only to be headlighted. There's a look - a fast gesture waved to them, to Cash and Pobble - not a good-bye. She seems to find her spine a minute later and calls to Pobble The Bear "You just stay the fuck away from me," she points with her left hand "you stay away," backing away, a tremor in her voice, hissing "He said it wasn't /time/.. Hiro keep him away from me.."  It takes a while for the idea to leave his cranium, some grand plan for free porn rental using this found BluckBusters card. And true to this, Cash seems detached from this group for a few beats as this scheme works it's self out. The obvious catch being, BlockBusters doesn't carry porn.   "Fuggin natzis... They don' even have porn, man." Cash utters in disgust, turning back to his friends that brave this weather. Of course without a mainline view of the inner workings of this drunkard's dome, these words are meaningless and out of place. "I'm still cookin' ya know. I got some mad kabob I put together."  Pobble, standing with a giant black and white segmented golf umbrella to stave off the downpour, stands near Smith, Hiro and Penny. Eyes that are suggestive of some kind of drug induced haze channel surf, flicking between the pair and the static fuzz of no-person somewhere between them which is only visible to the befurred man. An approximation of outrage crawls onto his features, but it's definately a half-arsed effort by the muscles. The desired look is missed, and the expression that shows up in it's place is more like.. senile old man thrown into bath of jam. Penny's actions cause him to step back a few, raising his cigarette holding hand palm outwards. "I haven't come for it. It's not time." Somewhere in the London drawl there is a sympathetic tone of apology. A blue blockbuster card is dropped into a pocket. [Public] Eri has joined this channel. Huh?  (Type "help" for help.) [TIC] Penny (Thursday) says, "Speaking of Steampunk, Wild Wild West is on TNT." [TIC] Pig Boy (Saturday) says, "nice"  Jon comes up the street with an umbrella over his head. The umbrella is black, and says 'Interzone Records' on it. He's walking at a good pace, a mostly smoked cigarette in hand. He pauses as he gets close to Cowpunchers and drops the cigarette butt on the soaked sidewalk, stubbing it out with his boot. He pulls a pack of Marlboro's from a pocket along with a black Zippo lighter. He removes a cigarette that's just a touch crumply from being in his pocket and straightens it out with his fingers. Once he's finished he lights the cigarette and puts the pack along with the lighter in his pocket. It takes a bit of work and time, but he gets it. Just his luck, that the minute he gets it all worked out, the rain stops. He mumbles under his breath as he exhales smoke. "Fuckin' rain."  Hiro looks away. Just like that - not his scene. Flicks something into his mouth, riposte off the thumb of his left hand, tips his head back for a long moment to catch some dirty rainwater - wash it down. Hard swallow of minimal liquid and something small'n knobbly. "Lovely day, inn't?" he asks Cash, after a moment: passing off his second, longer cigarette. It's a sad, soggy affair - barely burning with its twin.  It's not a particularly welcome offer, but Cash accepts it none the less. If not only to fulfill the symbology that weighs it, but to continue the pass eventually over to Pobble. Perhaps the unhappy and wet cigarette can snuggle up with a BlockBusters card and spoon a bit. "Whatever. This place never stops with the rain. And I need some more red soda, fugger." A search begins behind the denim flap of Cash's jacket and ends when he pulls out a flask to unscrew.  Penny discovers a ledge to lean on and positions herself where Pobble can't see her face. She disappears along the side of the building using Hiro as a shield. Her voice thins to a sometimes heard rant about time and it's meaning for another five minutes.  Then it's quiet. As the rain stops, there's a sound of something metal hitting the blacktop; and rainwater sluicing off the roof, tapping that metal in pairs of clinks. Other noises; interior distortions of conversation and music and one shuttle of gravel under a sliding foot.  Pobble takes the cigarette, it finding a home next to the cigarette he already has lit. Taking a puff on both at once he seems to look straight through Hiro at Penny for a moment before shrugging his rain laden fur clad shoulders and focusing his attention back on what blocks his perception of what he was seeing anyway. Umbrella spins, splaying out droplets everywhere and with a deft flick of the thumb it pops down as he angles it into some empty air. He sounds suddenly tired, swaying with the motion of demasting the rain deflector. "They kicked us out? Christ. I've not even been inside yet and they kicked me out." He'd sound angry if he diddn't sound so drug addled. "This is, an outrage." Sucking again on both of the cigarettes he twirls, swinging the brolly up under his arm like a baton. Looking about as if for a manager, he nearly spears Hiro with it's overly pointed end.  Jon puts his cigarette between his lips and puts his umbrella down. He exhales more smoke as he removes the cigarette from his lips. "Fuckers in there comin' up with reasons to kick people out?" He says it loud enough for anyone around to hear. He pushes his glasses up his nose. "Sometimes I wonder why the fuck I bother walkin' my ass down here." If he notices any hint of drugs in Pobble's voice, he makes no sign of it.  Hiro jerks back, recoils from Pobble's Penguinesque assault upon his person. He looks back and to the left (back, and to the left...): flicks the remainder of his cigarette off into the gutter. Buckle-down of the snaps on his record-bag. One last look between his partners in crime. Then, gone, not a word, retreating around the side of the bar - mumbled words, scuffle, straining noise, thump of meat against wall.  Alabaster Smith may be a preacherman, but so far he hasn't shown any signs of objecting to the presence of booze, tobacco, or other drugs. He just keeps to himself, watching, listening, keeping dry.  Enid comes into the area from the west. Enid has arrived.  From afar, Hiro tries to get you to your feet and against the wall, so you're not all sprawled out in the dust. Then books inexplicably.  "I hope he's goin' ta make soda..." Cash watches the techni-colored lab coat stalk off in silent retreat. Rain still dripping from the tip of his thrice broken nose. The presence of a preacher man settles, hunched outside an establishment of ill repute amongst scallywags. Long hair is parted, the better for Cash to see with. And above the fallen Penny and besides the wet fur man, the drunk drinks from his flask and smiles.   "Hey man." Cash offers to evangelic watcher.  "Bastards." says Pobble, turning to look towards the entrance to Cowpunchers. "You're all a bunch of bastards." He doesn't shout, and any trace of anger has dissapated. Mustered with the sucking of two cigarettes and expelled with carcinogens to the wind. An umbrella pokes from under his arm in a manner that still threatens to skewer the unwary as he turns to Cash, casting a perplexed look at Penny along the way. "Oi reakon," he begins, but then turns to nearby Jon, "Do this often do they?" he asks, voice fading in the brief five word question from curious to apathetic run off. Hand swings in a wide arc, palm open, cigarettes dangling. Apparently he wants Cash's flask.  Alabaster Smith dips his head. "Brother," he replies to Cash. God only knows what Smith's reasons for staying are. Maybe he just likes the ambience.  Everyone stands near Cowpunchers. Except Penny, who's slunk into a niche. Cash seems Drunk. Pobble looks fucked and sometimes agitated. Penny is hiding and rambling.  ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Enid................Punk rock Goldilocks.

"S'like anything else, man. Bunch of uptight bastards decides they wanna keep a certain class of folks out, they'll come up with any goddamn reason to do it. Doesn't even have to make sense." He shrugs it off. "I've been kicked out of my share of places cause people didn't like my look. Whatever that fuckin' means."  A moan. A hand then. On the cornerpiece of the building. It must be Penny where Hiro propped her up before he ran off. No explanation. Nothing. Man left in a big hurry. From experience, some know that's never good. The hand, Penny's hand, keeps readjusting itself like she's clinging to the edge of the world.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 6:    4 3 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success.  Enid rounds the corner, swinging her motorcycle helmet in one hand and whistling. Oh, somebody's in high spirits. You'd have to be in high spirits to try to whistle out a melody from psytrance. She passes in front of Cowpuncher's just in time to hear Jon opine about The Man keeping him down, a complaint that she answers by bumping into him with her shoulder. "You!" she says. "I don't like the look of you, Sickert. You're ugly an' you smell funny an' I wanna cigarette." She's at least thoughtful enough not to help herself to contents of his pockets, instead she extends a hand and wait. Of course, as she's waiting the realization slowly dawns on her that they're not alone here, at night, in front of a nightclub. She gaze darts self-conciously from one side to another.  Long distance to Pobble: Penny is channeling god, talking to it. Penny's done a massive quantity of herion to achieve this calling-forth. I'd roll to sense were I you.  Pobble rolls 4 (4 dice) at a difficulty of 6:    5 5 2 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success.  Cash rolls 3  (3 dice) at a difficulty of 4:    2   Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  "So like... what're you doin ova there, Penny." Someone finally comes round to it, as Cash hands off his flask to be hit. Pobble gets a ripe whiff of the stuff, it's running down each side of the silvery flask and mixing with the rain water. The denim man steps over to where Penny makes sidewalk angels.   "Get yer act together... man." Cash tries to coach the girl back off the cement. "Damn the Man. Next thing you know Music Town will take over." Enid's arrival brings a wonky smile to Pobble's lips with a sideways nod. "Awrighty." he says, and then he twitches just a little. As if a bee had just stung him in the side. It's not pain however that flash-marks his features but.. a look of loss. It dissapears as quickly as it came. While still facing Jon and Enid, eyes swivel to look sideways towards Penny's hand. Harsh drags on the twin cigarettes, in the waiting-for-scentencing fashion. Arm with umbrella takes flask. He begins to turn, suddenly appearing confused.  Jon bumps forward a little as Enid shoulder blocks him. "Well, I don't like your looks either bitch, and you dress funny." All the same he pulls out his slightly crumpled pack of Marlboro's and black Zippo and hands them to Motorcycle Mama Enid. "Here. I'm not gonna fuckin' light it for you." He tries to look stern and offended, but he can't help it, a bit of a smile tugs at the corner of his eyes "Where's your bike?" He pokes her in the leg with his umbrella.  Enid loops her arm through the faceplate of the helmet so as to free up both hands for cigarette-lighting. She bends her head down and cups her hand around the Zippo, not that it needs protection from any stray breeze. "'Round the corner," she says, tossing the lighter back to Jon. "Good luck findin' parking out here on a club night." As her tunnel vision expands to include the rest of the crowd in front of Cowpunchers, she smiles up at Pobble - the sort of sunny and beautific smile possessed only by children and happy drunks. It wavers in the face of Pobble's confusion, and Enid turns that expression on the white-suited Alabaster Smith. "Reverard," she drawls, exhaling smoke. "You've wandered a bit far from home, haven't you?"  Alabaster Smith smiles at Enid broadly, giving her the full attention of his personality. "Sister," he declares, "Ah am at home anywhere on God's green Earth. What brings you here?"  It pours out of her, an eerie language so gutteral at times it could be finnish and so sharp it may be japanese but it's definitely not english. The tone of the conversation Penny carries on seems to be a series of questions, one after another, sometimes interrupting herself. Tongue too full and heavy to round out the words properly. Penny stands up again with Cash acting as ballast, dry heaves and coughs. Too many pills. Or something.  With a last double drag, the twin cigarettes are flicked away bouncing off the wall to fizzle out on the rain drenched sidewalk. Pobble's look of confusion snaps away as he takes a swig from the flask in his hand, causing him to drop the umbrella which was held by his elbow. Itching palms it seems, now free fingers rub at the red gloves and looking back to Enid he says "Sorry. Bear with me a second." Tone has shifted to verging-on-sadness as he turns to head over to Penny, placing a supportive hand on her shoulder. Eyes find Cash, and he asks "Whaddshe have?"  You whisper "It isn't time yet but it keeps .. moving. Circulating. Like it's in the blood. . and it just wants to slip out." to Cash.  [TIC] Pobble says, "You saying anything understandable?" [TIC] Penny (Thursday) says, "Enochian" [TIC] Pobble has Enochian 3!  Jon continues to draw on his cigarette. He shoots a glance at Smith as he talks to Enid. He adopts his best 'bad ass' posture, though he is far from bad ass in appearance. He doesn't make any aggressiv moves or anything, but he gets that big brother pose by Enid, protective. "Who's your friend in the suit Nid?" As Penny heaves and coughs and Pobble speaks, his attention turns there.  [TIC] Penny (Thursday) is asking where it came from, where it will return to, what it wants; those things we never worked out that night on the beach.  Enid leans against Jon, not necessarily because she has any difficulty standing, but because cramps her friend's attempts as bad-assittude. She taps ash off of the end of her cigarrette. "Just takin' in the local color, Reverend. That's the Reverend Alabaster Smith, Sickert," she says, gesturing towards the man in the white suit. "Here to bring salvation to the great unwashed masses. Say hello to the nice man. He ain't gonna bite," she teases, but her sunny mood is short-lived as Penny begins to dry heave and speak in tongue. "Well. Shit." She looks to Pobble for confirmation or reassurance or, well, something. "She alright?"  Matt comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Matt has arrived. OOC> Matt says, "whups.. not here. sorry." Matt makes his way north. Matt has left.  "I dunno man. Mebbe she's the one that drank the last of the -red- soda." Helpful, much like a mailbox, Cash's center of gravity is low and provides Penny with rock in her trouble turbulent existence. Though the Cash ship sways over its anchor, but it's never uncontrolled in its drunken stupor. With an economy of movements, Penny is twirled and stood straight in an Aikido dance move.  Alabaster Smith grins toothily at Jon, and offers a hand. "Evenin', Brother," he greets. "As the lady says, Ah'm Alabaster Smith, a humble man of God here to do His works." He glances to Penny, eyebrow arching, as if affronted that she might show him up. "Ah do believe the Lord is sending us a sign."  Jon kind of casually leans forward and shakes Smith's hand, his attention distracted to Penny now. "Hi, I'm Jon Sickert." He keeps watching Penny even as he brings his hand back, "Red soda, booze, fuck man, she's on something. And I don't think it's friggin' Jesus." He lets Enid lean against him with no problem as he drops his cigarette to the ground and stubs it out. "I don't know what this would be a sign of, other than some people can't handle their shit."  Alabaster's interjections bring a curious look from Pobble. Although the situation doesn't seem to be all that humorous, his lips twist into a sardonic smile. "You have no idea." he says. Passing Cash's flask back to it's rightful place - Cash's hand, the unobvious humour passes and he nods to Enid with a reassuring 'Trust me, I'm a Doctor' look about him. "She'll be fine." From a pocket, Pobble pulls a handful of something, picks one, deposits the rest back and presses whatever it is into Penny's hand. "You'll be fine Pens." he says again, pulling a half drained plastic water bottle from another oversized pocket and giving it to the woman.  Dennis comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Dennis has arrived. Zoe comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Zoe has arrived.  Alabaster Smith smiles broadly at Jon. "The Lord, He works in mysterious ways, which is another way of saying He doth maketh the weird shit to happen, and leaves us to interpret it."  Penny is dry heaving, steadied by Cash near the doors to Cow Punchers. Pobble stands close by. Near the cluster stand Jon and Enid, Enid leaning on Jon. Alabaster smith stands against a wall near Jon and Enid.  Enid looks from Cash to Pobble and finally to the shakey Penny, eyes narrowing suspiciously. Somehow, she's less than reassured. "You think so?" she asks to Pobble, taking a drag on her cigarette as if she's been suddenly reminded of her own need for some medicine. The reverend's explanation is what finally calm her, and she lets out a sullen, "You've got that right," in agreement.  Dennis slips out of the Cowpuncher, gives Zoe a nod of farewell, and walks on down the street. Dennis makes his way west. Dennis has left. Zoe goes home. Zoe has left.  A little baggie is still clutched in her hand, a clue. Penny doesn't quite go limp but she's not the same person that was just out for a beer with her homes Hiro. A little paler, well. A lot paler. Hardly a contrast with her wet white hair plastered to her head. She stares at Cash with dilated pupils and a slack, sad smile. "He never goes completely," sounds rational. But she can't hold her head up and the second, the very second Pobble touches her, Penny tenses and buries her head on Cash's shoulder, like someone touched with a live wire.  Pobble's hand comes away from her hand, red and wet.  Examining her through the wet strands of his hair, Cash looks at the back of Penny's skull while she mans up to the doc's orders. "She'll be cool, man." Not that he sounds any more comforting in the matter now that he's retrieved his flask from sir Pobble. It's hit, his 30 proof breath travels and steams in the cold air. Penny's head resting on the swaying shoulder, Cash slowly infests her with the drunken swagger that snakes in his spine constantly. It's contagious, and now that she's allowed her weight to be placed atop of the squat Jew, unavoidable. "Far out." Cash digs it, he never goes completely. That'll be comforting in lonely times.  Jon watches the scene and nods idly at Smiths' words. "I suppose. I never put much stock in God myself." He notes the red on Pobble's hand. He doesn't say anything, but he does keep his gaze where the action's at. "Where you been tonight? I ran by the store and you weren't there. I thought you were closing?" That's it make light conversation. He feels for his cigarettes and lighter and doesn't find htem in his pocket. "Gimme my smokes."  Pobble lets out a long low sigh as he stares down at his fingers. Silver daubed with red. Red on white, red on red. For some reason or other, this turn of events doesn't seem to surpise him. Neither does the fact that Penny spasms when he touches her. The bloody finger smears something onto the bottle in his other hand and he holds this out to Penny as he takes a step back, reaching into his pocket and taking out another pair of cigarettes. He lights both, sucking in and speaking around them. He's starting to look tired.  [TIC] Penny (Thursday) says, "this feels weird. this scene. drama. but maybe not in a good way." [TIC] Pobble says, "Enochian symbolic equivalent of 'Chill' written in blood on the water bottle. It does seem weird." [TIC] Pobble says, "I feel ya." [TIC] Pobble says, "I'm the one that usually does all the falling down in bloody heaps."  Enid has returned the lighter, but she produces Jon's pack of Malboros from her jacket pocket and stuff them back into his. "I had to go pick somethin' up for TC," she says, eyes downcast as she makes some attempt to keep from staring at the Penny-related commotion. "An' now I need a beer," she says in the same sort of way that people usually say they need oxygen. "You drinkin', Reverend?" she asks, turning towards the door.  "Funny you should put it that way," Alabaster comments to Jon, "for He has much invested in you." He shakes his head at Enid. "Sadly, Ah fear my time right here is done, and Ah have to take care of some business."  Penny drops the baggie, takes the bottle and slumps into Cash. In tune with his wobble, her eyes kinda roll up back into her head. She curls the bottle inward toward her chest and 'hnnns' humming her way back to functioning "I cut .. myself. Didn't I. Shouldn't have touched ..me .. P-p-pobs I'm not ..ss-safe." Her eyes roll over toward the other trio, says "Oh.. shit," like she might cry.  Jon watches Smith and gives the man a vague smile before he turns back to Penny and that ensuing drama. "Dude, there anything one of us can do to help? I mean, she ain't lookin' any better." He gives an unsure look to Enid as if seeking her advice silently. "I mean...shit like this can get bad quick sometimes."  Enid's mouth forms a straight line. "Night then, Reverend." She catches Jon's look and gives him a barely perceptible shake of her head. "C'mon." She looks right past him at the bleeding girl. "I think it's time for us to go inside."  Shaking his head, Pobble turns back to Jon, Enid and Smith. Cigarettes waggle between his lips as he says "She'll be fine. Honest." He does sound quite certain of this as he reaches down and picks up his umbrella. "Home's not far Pens. You can rest soon." Straightening up as demanded, Pobble begins to lead his companions up the road with a tired smile to Enid, "See you soon.." A nod to John, "Thanks guvna." OOC> Penny says, "Night guys ..uh ..sorry it got so weird. Blame it on the rain?" OOC> Enid laughs. "No problem." OOC> Pobble says, "Yeah, next time it'll be much worse. I mean, better."  Jon nods to Pobble then looks back to Enid. "Come on, I'll buy you a beer." He heads toward the bar then. OOC> Jon laughs. "Nah, thanks for the RP. Weird is okay :)" Enid disappears with Jon into the club. Enid makes her way into the Cowpunchers.

      Dark Horizons Waxworks - Main Room(#1957RJ)           This room is not particularly large. Just an entrance room, really. Heavy black curtains hang over the windows in front, shutting out almost all of the ambient light from the world beyond. The room is lit only by real candles and gas lamps. The air carries an old, almost must scent to it, giving you the sense of walking in to a building centuries old, even though it is a relatively new rennovation.          The walls are mostly wood panelled but not in any particular order. Chaos seems to be theme of the decor. The ceilings are high. Ridiculously high seeming, as if they extended far beyond human vision, in to the pitch depths up above. Something may be lurking up there, even now. In several spots there shelves are set in to the wall. Each shelf is empty. The books themselves appear to be sunken in to the walls, giving the room an even odder feel. The floors are completely bare of any sort of coverings. Just finely polished stone. In the center of the main room is a series of ten chairs. The really nice kind, with deep seats and thick velvet cushions. There is a circular table in the middle of them with two books displayed.          Off to the left side is a smallish office. In the back center of the room, you can see a pair of doors, oaken. One door has the face of a smiling demon, a brightly polished brass nameplate under it says Fiction. One door has the face of an angry, almost leering demon, another brightly polished brass nameplate under this one says Fact. There are no visible handles, just a hole in each open mouth with tongues sticking out.                                 +views available                                  Contents: Cornelius Obvious exits: Fiction    Fact    Out    Unfolded and massive and floppy and awkward: Hiro is struggling with a brouchure-map from the Erin's Vale Board of Tourism, engaged in an attempt to fold it back into its original dimensions. He veers through the door - holds it with his shoulder, releases, gives the map a good shake, and begins to re-fold it.  So it's saturday afternoon and you're at the wax museum. Lucky you! When the door opens, the old man who was dozing on one of the large chairs wakes up rather suddenly. Fortunately for him, it looks like someone else is on the case. One of the back doors opens and a small man emerges from it. Dressed in a tuxcedo, he approaches where you stand. In a high, tremory voice, "Welcome to the Dark Horizons Waxworks!" Actually, he yells this. It's very annoying.  Hiro's map flops in half - he seems to have figured it out, now, peering over the edge at the approaching spokesperson. He squints: nudges his glasses up the line of his nose with a thumb, the glossy brouchure crinkling with the gesture. A deep breath, then: "HELLO!" Bellowing, really. His voice is no less irritating when delivered at high volume. "I AM HERE TO SEE WONDERS AND AMAZEMENTS AS PROMISED IN THIS GLOSSY THIRTY SIX BY TWENTY FOUR BROUCHURE."  "Please!" Cornelius yells at the top of his lungs, hurriedly approaching the pair. "Stop yelling!" This is mostly directed at the small man who looks up at Cornelius with beady eyes. "Yes sir." Cornelius rubs his eyes and says, "Fezcy, please go and finish your work." The dwarf bows and then makes his way off. Cornelius turns and offers you a smile. His voice is soft and raspy, like sandpaper on glass. "Sorry sir... he is enthusiastic about his job here and enjoys greeting guests. Welcome indeed."  Cornelius           This is an older man. Slight, sort of frail looking. Top of his head has a sort of dusty look to it. In truth it's just what remains of his white hair clinging to his bald head in light little whisps. Ice blue eyes are behind wire rimmed glasses. Skin is pale white, wrinkled, looks almost like paper. Cheeks are lightly tinted red, just a bit of color there. Nose is hooked, downwards and his lips are thin, set in a line of disapproval.          Slender, scarecrow-like body appears to be loosely clad. The shirt is a plain blue dress shirt with a golden green tie that hangs down in front. The pants are light cotton dress pants, a black color, neatly pressed looking. Shoes are nice but kind of scuffy looking. Carries a cane in his left hand. Ebony with a silver cap in the shape of a smiling woman's head.  Hiro gives Cornelius a look. That's all it is - a look, somehow managing to be completely devoid of specific overtones. The map, now returned to its original dimensions and bearing a picture of the coastline, drops neatly into a labcoat pocket. "Good evening," his tone is a mumble in comparison, gradually ramping up to conversation volume. He offers a hand. "You're the proprietor, right? Heard so much 'n all that."  The old man looks at your hand as though you have offered him a dead rat to eat. Then he extends his hand and shakes yours. His fingers are slender and almost spidery. The skin is paper white and smooth for the most part, with some rough callouses here and there that indicate years of hard work. It also has that dry, wrinkly feeling to it that old people hands have. "Yes. Cornelius Shaboz. A pleasure to have you here sir."  Hiro's hand retreats into his pocket, accompanying its twin. "Hiro." No last name. "Pleased ta pleasedta," he counters, looking away - no eye contact for more than a few seconds at a time. Natural jittery disposition, maybe. Jumpy? Looks back: fixes his attention on icy blues. "Kind of an artist myself, Mister Shaboz. D'you fancy showin me yer work?"  "My work is open for all to see." Cornelius remarks as he walks towards the back of the hall, leading to the spot where the two doors are. "Where would you like to begin?" He asks, those icy blue eyes regarding you. "Fact... or fiction?"  A moment's pause, that faint indecision before the first step falls into place. Then, that kind of forced easygoing stride - rhythm only by contrivance. "Let's go with the imagination side of the show first, huh?" Hiro flashes teeth with the comment.  "Everyone starts with Fiction." Cornelius remarks. Approaching the door, he sticks his hand in the smiling demon's mouth. There is a metallic sound and the mouth suddenly snaps shut with such violence as you might imagine it would sever his hand. But he seems unruffled. A movement and then the door opens. "Step inside Hiro the Artist."  Hiro skirts past Cornelius, his aversion to further contact just barely apparent. You enter the door marke Fiction. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Fiction           Welcome to the hall of Fiction. The hallway is filled with a series of scenic wax sculpture of infamous men, women and monsters from literary history. Each one of these is done up fantasically but with enough of a sense of reality in them to create an air of true menace. This hallway breathes life in to dark figures in fiction, the grand literary tradition of horror, both modern and gothic. Each scene seems to be worse than the last. The gore. The expressions of agony, of torment. It's a difficult thing to look at for long. Unless you like that sort of thing.          This hallway is fairly long, wrapping around to the side, probably heading back the way you came. The floors here are rough, unworked earth it would seem. The ceiling here is extremely high, invisible to the eye. Very dark up above. Occasionally you can hear a menacing sort of scrabbling noise in the rafters. As though something were following you as you move along the displays. From somewhere in the darkness, light fog trickles down. It leaves maybe a foot worth of cover on the ground, hard to penetrate.                                  +views available                                  Obvious exits: Out    "This room holds the nightmarish dreams of humanity. From literature or mythology." Cornelius remarks, closing the door behind himself. "The first is Dr. Franktenstein's monster. A creature that represents, in some ways, a tremendous amount of hubris in man's drive for power."  Quiet pages: Perception + Awareness, diff 5. Hiro rolls perception+awareness (5 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  4 -1- -1- -1-   Achieving -2 successes, resulting in a botch! You paged Quiet with 'Lol.'. Quiet pages: Ahhh... From afar, Quiet thinks... acid trip. You paged Quiet with 'I'm having a flashback. :b'. Quiet pages: Go ahead and make a pose. I'll emit your experience.  Hiro takes a few steps into the room, coming to a gradual stop as he takes in the experience of the chamber. He bobs his head wordlessly in response to Cornelius' words - eyes fixed on the scene depicting Dr. Frankenstein's monster, following the path of patchwork flesh to the girl laying broken in his arms. No commentary is offered - he just takes it in, soaking up the details.  Extending your awareness in this place was most assuredly a critical mistake. You suddenly find yourself overwhelmed by brutal feelings of malevolence. The air seems to shimmer and ripple. You can see tortured souls, their screams filling your ears. Literally hundreds of souls appear to be sealed in to the walls, all of them reaching out for you. Inside the displays you can see little worlds of evil, like a little bundle of hatred, containing entities. Everything seems to warp and run, your skin seems to be almost on fire from the pounding magical and spiritual corruption that fills this place.  Hiro's eyes narrow, slowly - fixed on the broken girl's face. Then: flick to the side, slowly widening. A single step backwards - towards Cornelius, unwittingly. Low-grade vibration running down the spine, showing in the tremor of his hands, now clenched up into balls in his pockets. "I..." Pause. There is something wrong with the kid - he's on drugs, or psychotic, or far too sensitive a soul to be visiting the horror section of a wax museum. "...think I..." Words come out haltingly, the pauses inappropriate, the end of syllables cut off jaggedly. "--gotta be somewhere. You gotta. Excuse me." Shoulders hunch unconsciously, protectively: he turns to face Cornelius slowly, as if forcing himself.  The old man's smile seems disproprotionately large from the rest of his face. The old teeth seem almost jagged in his maw, as if he were eager to devour your soul. "Of course Hiro the Artist." The old fellow reaches out, grasping your arm, as if to steady you. The hand is icy cold and there is an awful breeze that blows through the room. An intensely frigid one. The door is opened. You missed it. Did he open it himself or did it open on its own.  Eyes focus with the intensity that only comes with drugs or psychosis. Hiro seems to be staring -- with a dentist's scrutiny -- at Cornelius' teeth. Then: contact, jerk away, "Not to be impolite or nothin," hissed between his own chompers. Clenched. Get away: he bolts, the reserve of cool run out, run dry. Burnt up. Out the door.  Nothing impedes your departure. You soon find yourself outside of the Waxworks. Indeed, the whole building appears to be composed of those writhing bodies.

      Pool Hall - Back Room          The walls of this room were possibly once white, but are now stained nicotine yellow with yet dirtier splotches in places. The dark red carpet seems newer and less obnoxious than the one found in the main hall. Tall lamps stand in each corner of the room, shaded so they cast their light upwards giving the room a certain ambiance.          The central space is occupied by a trio of well used couches with newish slipcovers in dark shades - One green, one red, one blue. Arranged into a vague triangle, a low table sits between them with a black ashtray sat upon it. Against one wall is a stocked mini-bar sealed with a padlock and next to this a rack has been mounted on the wall containing poker chips and cards, similarly locked. The mood of the room is shot to peices by what sits squarely against the far wall opposite the door: The porcelain goddess. One shiny clean toilet with a wooden seat and lid, sitting next to a washbasin. A little way down towards the right corner hangs a payphone. A noticable thing is that it is overly quiet in here, perhaps the walls have been soundproofed as none of the sound from the adjacent hall carries over.  Obvious exits: Door [O]  You paged Quiet with 'Hey'. You paged Quiet with 'Listen, can I talk to the dead girl?'. [waiting... waiting... waiting...] Long distance to Quiet: Penny shakes you. From afar, Quiet is shaken. Wha? You paged Quiet with 'Dead girl.'. Quiet pages: Which dead girl. There are lots. You paged Quiet with 'I wanna talk to her. Can I talk to her? The one we were looking for. that one.'. Quiet pages: How did you wanna talk to her? From afar, Quiet shakes you. You paged Quiet with 'Hi, I'm back. Sorry. SO yeah - wanna contact her. Just a sec'. Quiet pages: Just gotta gimmie the how and I'll be glad to give it a try. :)   You paged Quiet with 'I want to summon her, if she's open to it (spirit 3/corr 1)'. Quiet pages: You don't need Spirit 3. Just spirit 2. May I join you? You paged Quiet with 'I knew that. Honest. Join away.'.  Quiet will be joining you in three seconds. Quiet has arrived.  OOC> Quiet says, "I knew you did. Otherwise I'd have to take your magick license away. ;)" OOC> Quiet says, "Go ahead and pose what it is you are doing."  Penny has a bad photocopy of the girl. The girl in question. It's upside down on the table and she's trying to make it levitate, trying to make it stand up on edge and turn around to face her. Penny says to the photocopy "Look, your parents .. /and/ your mentor were worried sick. We know you're over there so just come this way. Come over here and tell us who got you. We're all really sorry.."  OOC> Quiet says, "Extended ritual?" OOC> Penny says, "If you wouldn't mind. With a wp spend first?" OOC> Quiet says, "I don't mind. How many rolls?" OOC> Penny says, "3 - one to get her attention, one to bring her across and one to send her back." OOC> Quiet says, "That would actually be two different effects. attention/bringing across would be one. Sending back would be another. How many rolls for the first effect?" OOC> Penny says, "we get a reduced diff here in the sanctum, too so.. whatcha think - diff 5? // 2" OOC> Quiet says, "werks for me" OOC> Penny says, "Right on."  [Ed Note: TOTALLY forgot I wasn't actually IN The sanctum, perhaps A Sanctum... props to Quiet?]  OOC> Quiet says, "Bombs away. Fire off the dices."  [Willpower] Penny spends a Willpower point.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  5 8 5 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  10 4 8 Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  OOC> Penny dances! OOC> Quiet says, "Woot! Very nice." OOC> Quiet says, "Go ahead. Make one more pose and then I'll come in." The paper tilts up.  Even Penny's surprised - she's never attempted something so basic this sober. "The thing is, if you were rubbed out by the same people we're semi/quasi hiding out from? We really need to know, so could you come talk to me?"  The paper tilts up and then it falls off the board. It flutters to the ground where it lays for a moment. Then it trembles and the girl's eyes blink. She gazes up at you. "Who... who are you?" The soft, spectral voice seems to echo oddly from where the picture lies.  Penny pivots the chair and plants her feet on either side of the paper. She leans over, elbows to knees and says in her nicest, most convivial voice "Aw sweets, I'm Penny. Your mentor sent us chasin'after you but you were way ahead of us, weren't you."  "I... I can't be here." She says softly. "He'll know! And he'll find me." The girl sounds fearful. The paper flutters and sweeps along the ground a few steps. As if she were trying to run. "What... what do you want from me?"  "No one can find you if you come on out," she coaxes and offers her hand "Come on out. It's safe up here with me. Come on up and tell me who did this to you, that's all I want you to do - just come up here and talk to me." Penny kicks the chair back and gets down on the floor where the paper is. "I /can't/ leave. I'm bound... I can feel it." The paper shivers again and then she says, "What do you want?"  You say, "Who bound you? Who put you there? WHO? Are you alone?" She's furious and kinda freaked out. Why won't she come out? Penny's actually breaking a sweat. "Who put you there?"  "The dark one... the wax man." The girl responds, her voice still has that hollow echo. "There are so many here... hundreds.. I don't know for sure..." She sounds really scared, alone. "I'm with the Frankenstein... he killed me." Penny seethes, hands fisted "And there's no way to get out? None at all? No door? No window? Hundreds?" Piecing in together, Penny shrieks "He put you inside the figure? WHY? What is it making you do? Does..." and exactly what was she going to say. She's lost her ability to talk, just gaping at the talking piece of paper.  "We are all trapped here... we hear dark whispers from those who have been there from the beginning. That we shall be consumed... burned up. A ritual of some dark purpose... I don't know. But I'm so scared. Dying is one thing... but this means I will never..." Words trail off and the paper quivers a bit.  You say, "Okay, okay. Don't.. I'm coming to get you." Somewhat bravely, Penny declares this with a voice not entirely forceful "Okay? I'm coming. We're coming and .. just .. don't tell anyone. Is there anything you /can/ do?"  "Nothing... there is one here... a little girl. Somehow she got free... but she stays behind. Because if he knows, he'll replace her." The paper trembles again a moment. "I'll see if she can find you... oh no... I hear him... he's coming..." The words trail off and she screams. And then the paper bursts in to flames.  Penny reaches to put out the flames - you never know what Pobble's left laying around. Or that fucking monkey. Who is cowering behind a chair to Penny's left. She takes it out on him "Couldn't you be the least bit helpful Dave? You could've TOLD me. That fucking creep from the record store. And ENID, .. Daisy'll be so disappointed. Dave, get out here. You're on recon. Don't even START" when the Monkey starts to disappear "you know what's going on here," she points to a nebulous space between herself and Pobble's lab "so don't even pretend like you're just working for him, okay?" Penny, she's hysterical.  Pobble opens the door and enters from the main room. Pobble has arrived.  Okay so like, this is how it is:  Penny's out of sight but her hat and jacket are draped across the back of that first couch. Get a little further into the room and there's Penny folded up in some medatative state. Nearby is a pile of ashes. Dave's still chittering in a corner some kind of crazy-sounding shit about Penny torturing spirits.  There is the sound of a key rattling in the lock, one.. two.. three. Click, clock, clack. The door creaks open, the motion coinciding with the exhalation of noxious smoke from the entering individual. Haloed in the barlight-through-drugsmoke haze, Pobble strolls into the back room with a bottle of beer in his non-smoke holding hand. He stops, peering across at David L with eyes that would be curious if they weren't struggling to focus through the haze of potent narcotics. "Whots going on 'ere then?"  You say, "Your monkey's got no balls." A declarative.  Penny's eyelids flutter and her posture slackens. Her spine cleaves her to the couch and she hauls herself up with an elbow climbing into the cushion. "Went a little astral to check it out. We have a little problem," she goes on, not missing a beat "the kid we're supposed to be returning to her Mentor is not-quite-dead and I don't really know if it's responsible to return her ghost to her Mentor or not! I mean.. if something had happened to me I know I'd want to be with you guys in whatever unfinished form. It totally beats an eternity of lonely wandering y'know? All pathetic and unresolved but impotent at the same time?"  "You what what?" Pobble wanders over and plonks himself down next to you on the couch. The motion causes him to expel another little burp of intoxicating fumage. Thin silver topped fingers proffer the black smokestick in your general area as he swigs from his bottle. "That hermetic wench is dead but not forgotten? Where'd you find her?" Putting the bottle between his legs, Pobble extracts a small baggie of white powder from his pocket and throws it at Dave. Dave grabs it and burrows his way into one of the couches. There are sounds of sniffing.  "Mr. Dark put her in the Frankenstein statue.." indicating with pointed finger that she is not in fact having you off "..it's what she said. And there's hundreds more like her. And it's Mr. Dark's doing. Scared the shit out of me when I couldn't pull her through to me. But we have to get her." It isn't nobility or anything like it, in Penny's voice has crept a familiar note; greed. "We're getting paid to and should live up to expectation if not legend." Penny unfolds her legs and pulls the bottle out from between Pobble's. She swigs "So go find that map in Hiro's mess and we'll be on our way."  "Ha ha." exclaims the good Dr sucking down a hearty dose of narcotic bliss as a metaphorical pat on the back. "So I was right. Crazy fucker Cornelius was up to no good the whole time. Can't fuckin' make a wax crowbar my ass." He makes a little wave, "Don't need a map, I knows where that place is well enough." The far couch makes a snorting noise then chitters quietly. Pobble purses his lips, reacing forward to ash into the central cigarette-waste disposal container. "Intrestin'.. Interestin interestin intrrestingg." Repetition causes slurring. Steve lies back lolling head lazily against the back of the couch. Something registers and his noggin rolls to one side - your side - and he asks dazily "You want to go now? Like.. right now right now?"  "No, I want to go when I've had time to think about how stupid it would be to steal a spirit from whatever jail it's stuck inside from really what amounts to an unknown enemy. Keene would kill me for thinking so no, I do not want to wait and /think/. I want to go right now, right now." She was saying all this as she was getting off the floor, getting her jacket, picking up markers from the pen/cil jar. Penny's ready.  Pobble says, "Joo yoo think he's a neffanzi?" The smoke between his lips waggles up and down spuriously as he queries. A hand lazily pats pockets, checking for supplies in the face of unexpected action. Drugs, check. Weaponry, check. Monkey under sofa snorting cocaine, check. Inclination to elevate one's position from couch, absent. Pobble closes his eyes for a moment, "Not later later?"  You say, "Now now, right fucking now. Get up, get that fucking monkey and let's get in the car and drive. I don't know shit about what he is but I want him to know we can't stand that kinda shit. Not a fucking minute of it." She checks her own pockets; nothing but lint. "Look I don't wanna kill the guy, I just want to get the kid so you got a gun or something? Just in case?"  The chemist nods, and seems to concentrate a moment. Dave saunters out from under the couch and moves to Pobble's side as he stands. The smoke is stubbed out and he stretches, yawning. "Fine fine.. I just hope you know what you're doing since I have no fucking idea what's going on." Moving towards you he wraps an arm about your shoulder, "If this all goes town the shitter," A solemn nod, "It was good." Dr Steve's face melts to one side, making it hard to choose in favour of these words being serious doubts as to the survival of the dastardly duo this evening.  [Ed Note: Then, speak of the devil... ] As Pobble steps out...  Keene comes in from the main hall. Keene has arrived.  Smells like something burning. Dark in here but not as dark as it could be.  So Pobble just stepped out for a smoke or maybe to find something to lock Penny in the office with. Either way he's not here and she's making notations in a glossy unfolded map of the Wax Museum. "Ready?" manic, crazy look in her eyes "Oh. Steve." What she says, what she calls you when she's disappointed.  Keene comes in from the bar, spritzing his coat with a little Febreze bottle as he closes the door behind him. He looks over at Penny with his usual unreadable expression, continuing to spritz himself while making his own assessments of the situation.  "Hello, Penny. What are you up to?"  Penny says, "See this is exactly what I was telling Ste" confused a minute "-Steve. .. STEVE!" So annoyed, she grabs the map up in a fist, not realizing. "This is just what I said to him, I JUSt said it to him. He wanted to go later and not now and I knew YOU'D agree with him" accusing Keene of something clearly apparent to her "I hate it when you gang up on me." Like the pout could last long. "The point is she's not quite dead and her Mentor's still paying, right? He didn't say she had to be in one piece, right?"  Long distance to Quiet: Penny is scening out some more of the preamble. You're welcome to watch. Quiet will be joining you in three seconds. Quiet has arrived.  "I was told," Keene says, after a moment's consideration of Penny's incoherent rambling, "that he wished to know what her disposition was. We had no power to prevent her death, since we were informed of this well after the fact. Or so I believe."  Keene fishes a cigarette out of his pocket and rests it between his lips, digging in his pocket for a lighter. "How dead is she, anyway?"  Penny says, "So what, you think he was fishing for info she was actually more dead than alive? Like ..maybe he sent her off on purpose? I never even thought'a that." Her fidgeting paused for a moment, she comes back to life pulling at her clothes - she knocked something over, a paper cup rolls and bumps into an arc on the floor. Inbetween wiping down the wet, Penny looks up at matches hanging off the edge of the table, indicating with a nod "You got anything we can put her in? Like a spare Ronald or something? She got bound once so we can throw her in something til we get back to the loft... y'know, so we don't lose track of her."  As always, what Keene chooses not to answer is more telling than what he actually decides to acknowledge. He walks over to the table, picks up a match, strikes it against something convenient and lights up. The cigarette soothes the turbulence within, at least for a while.  "Does it have to be particular?" asks Keene. "A particular size, a particular shape, a particular color?"  "Nah, anything really" Penny seems sure of it but adds "Bigger than a breadbox? Duffle sized? The thing is we gotta go now and get her and find out what he's doing with the other hundred or so he's got stashed there." She's just about packed up and ready to go.  "Charming," Keene says, completely deadpan. He puffs on his cigarette, turning to head towards the door. "Off we go once again, to our imminent deaths. I'm going to make sure this is on my expense report. I probably have something in the car."  OOC> Penny shakes Quiet OOC> Quiet wakes up. Eh? Wha? Ya need me for sumpin? OOC> Penny says, "Yeah. We're leaving (with an invisible Pobble) for the Wax Museum." OOC> Quiet says, "Okay. My alter evil is there already." OOC> Penny doesn't want to scene with him; unless he's somehow bugged the pool hall's office and knows who I am and why I'm coming. OOC> Quiet says, "He's always there unless he's out for some reason. Whether or not you see him." OOC> Quiet says, "Cornelius lives there." OOC> Penny says, "right so. off we go, non-chalant to unbind a spirit."  -= Jones and Greens =-          There is a mixture of various ethnicities and social backgrounds within this small area, a melting pot all come into one. The very businesses appear to take a culturally diverse avenue of theme. Many smaller stores here can be found selling foreign foods and other rarities such as special health items. Besides the consumable goods, other fine import stores are littered about as well, making this small area more interesting for those that enjoy window browsing.         The nickname of 'Tourist Lane' has been placed upon the area, proving that out-of-towners often stay at a small cluster of higher class hotels. Both those visiting for vacation as well as business reasons can be found in almost equal amounts. Small stands of maps, newspapers, and novelty items can be found down the lane to take advantage of those visiting the city.   Contents: Phineas Obvious exits: Dark Horizon DH  OOC> Penny lets Keene set.  Driving in a black luxury sedan -- an Infiniti of some variety -- Keene and Penny take a trip from the bad part of town to another bad part of town ... the tourist district. The vehicle rolls into a nearby parking garage, where it makes its way to a certain part of the structure that is statistically unlikely to be disturbed by most car thieves or homeless people.  Climbing out of the vehicle, Keene sets the car alarm and begins walking towards their destination. Across his shoulder is his messenger bag's strap, with the bag itself having weird dents in it from an over-large object within.  "This is an exceptionally poor idea, you know," Keene says, deadpan.  Phineas has disconnected.  "Pobble thinks so, too. Don't worry." Penny's a bit keyed up. Sugar-high of a variety unknown to even six-year-olds. She's putting on a pair of wire-rimmed glasses as they walk down the block toward the Wax Museum. The pair look strange among a vacationing crowd, "I wouldn't do this with your approval anyway." She chews the cap off a marker and tips it felt-side down in her back pocket. When it bleeds out, it'll just add to her urban hippy look.  "You realize," Keene says, reaching into his coat, pulling out a hip flask, and taking a swig from it before holstering it once again, "that you need me alive to collect on whatever boon he'll give us for this job."  He puts his hands in his pocket, watching traffic idly as they grow nearer to the museum. "Because I would rather not get Chased."  "Shoulda parked closer."  Penny's head is now in the game. Because when questioned, witnesses usually describe how the angry young person elbowed and shoulder their way through the crowd. So she throws her shoulders back and affects a pleasant, if not sunny, air. She takes a hold of Keene's hand, fellow tourist and tugs him as they close on the doors to the museum.   "Subtle," Keene says, being tugged along. He keeps at least one hand on his bag throughout.           A very nice, plastoral looking building in the busier part of town. Recently rennovated, it has a pleasant facade to it, completely with a large hedge around the property, manicured lawn and topiaries of animals.  You enter the waxworks. The large double doors swing open for you. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Main Room(#1957RJ)          This room is not particularly large. Just an entrance room, really. Heavy black curtains hang over the windows in front, shutting out almost all of the ambient light from the world beyond. The room is lit only by real candles and gas lamps. The air carries an old, almost must scent to it, giving you the sense of walking in to a building centuries old, even though it is a relatively new rennovation.         The walls are mostly wood panelled but not in any particular order. Chaos seems to be theme of the decor. The ceilings are high. Ridiculously high seeming, as if they extended far beyond human vision, in to the pitch depths up above. Something may be lurking up there, even now. In several spots there shelves are set in to the wall. Each shelf is empty. The books themselves appear to be sunken in to the walls, giving the room an even odder feel. The floors are completely bare of any sort of coverings. Just finely polished stone. In the center of the main room is a series of ten chairs. The really nice kind, with deep seats and thick velvet cushions. There is a circular table in the middle of them with two books displayed.         Off to the left side is a smallish office. In the back center of the room, you can see a pair of doors, oaken. One door has the face of a smiling demon, a brightly polished brass nameplate under it says Fiction. One door has the face of an angry, almost leering demon, another brightly polished brass nameplate under this one says Fact. There are no visible handles, just a hole in each open mouth with tongues sticking out.                                 +views available                                  Contents: Cornelius Obvious exits: Fiction FI  Fact F  Out O Keene enters from the street. Keene has arrived.  OOC> Cornelius says, "Please, pose entry. I will be Quiet's extension for scening until otherwise notified that the NPC Cornelius has shown himself." OOC> Keene says, "K."  "Wow look at the doors," she whispers, pretending awe. Convincing. And when she thinks no one's looking, Penny grins at the table and chairs, mutters something under her break to Keene and steers him toward the doors "So which shall we check out first, fact or fiction?" Some kind of open-ended joke, they stare.  The museum is empty. Or so it seems. It's extremely quiet and the lights are extremely dim. It would seem that no one is home at the moment. Keene has a messenger bag over one shoulder that has weird bulges in it. It contains something larger than the bag really ought to contain. He acts the part of a tourist perfectly, having a true gift for deception. Everything from his eyes to his body language reads `sucker' rather than `terrorist'.  "Fiction sounds neat," the suited man says.  Penny was headed that way anyway. But the word 'neat' coming from Keene is enough to stop her mid stride. Puts a bounce on it, heel to toe "But Tommy I heard there was one of *the president* in Fact - can't we go there first?" She blocks the door and handle to the Fiction room; full-on - vamping it up horror-story-style. The door swings open and she leans backwards into the tilt. It even creaks.  Keene generates a put-upon expression as Penny whines at him, moving to intercept her. "Jen-Jen," he says, generating a cutesy name on the fly, "if we go see the President now, it won't be as special as if we saw it last. Hey, be careful --"  He jerks forward into the Fiction room, as if to try to pre-empt her from a spill. Keep moving, Keene.  You enter the door marke Fiction. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Fiction          Welcome to the hall of Fiction. The hallway is filled with a series of scenic wax sculpture of infamous men, women and monsters from literary history. Each one of these is done up fantasically but with enough of a sense of reality in them to create an air of true menace. This hallway breathes life in to dark figures in fiction, the grand literary tradition of horror, both modern and gothic. Each scene seems to be worse than the last. The gore. The expressions of agony, of torment. It's a difficult thing to look at for long. Unless you like that sort of thing.         This hallway is fairly long, wrapping around to the side, probably heading back the way you came. The floors here are rough, unworked earth it would seem. The ceiling here is extremely high, invisible to the eye. Very dark up above. Occasionally you can hear a menacing sort of scrabbling noise in the rafters. As though something were following you as you move along the displays. From somewhere in the darkness, light fog trickles down. It leaves maybe a foot worth of cover on the ground, hard to penetrate.                                  +views available                                  Obvious exits: Out O  Cornelius enters from the main room. Cornelius has arrived. Keene enters from the main room. Keene has arrived.  Penny who is Jen-Jen (Jenny jenny who can I turn to?) makes a grab for Keene on his way past her, slips onward expecting the door to swing shut. Did it? The noise was absent and it's lack settles down into the pit of the stomach. She scuffs her boots down the hallway, commenting as she goes along "Poor Lizzie, doesn't she always get a bum rap.."  The hall of Fiction is extremely quiet. Silent like the grave. Your voices echo strangely in this place. With it's foggy bottoms and large, open tops. Everything here feels... wrong. In a very subtle, difficult to define kind of a way. OOC> Penny says, "awareness rolls?" OOC> Cornelius says, "Yes. Awareness + Perc, diff 7 for the moment."  Keene rolls perception+awareness vs 7 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 0:  8 4 10 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Penny rolls perception+awareness (7 dice) at a difficulty of 7:  7 -1- 2 5 3 5 3 Achieving 0 successes, resulting in a failure  Keene grabs onto Penny, trying to keep her upright. Once they're through the door, though, he releases her and adjusts his messenger bag strap. "Wow, this place is creepy," he says, the master of understatement.  OOC> Penny says, "You'd think MY odds were better."  "Jeepers Freddie," she elbows him and laughs in a pretty careless way "You should hear yourself. I bet it's just the temperature change - all that dry ice in one place tends to get a little on the stale side a few hours in." On the whole Penny's pretty blase. Or good at faking blase.  Penny's good. Keene is better. He laughs in that overly loud American way, making an exaggerated `spooky' face. "But bad ventilation is spooooooky," he says, like Count Chocula.  +view of Frankenstein's Monster: Dark, dreary gothic village setting mayhaps provide you with some sense of where this takes place. Several small vllage huts are in the background. A moon hangs high in the sky. Apparently some of the fog generators must be above this display because it is foggy also, excess spilling to the walkway. In the scene you can see Frankenstein's Monster in all of it's terror and pity provoking grandeur. It stands there, face weirdly illuminated by a greenish light. In it's arms is a small, broken body. A young girl with a wilted daisy still clutched in her right hand that hangs out loosely. Her eyes are glassy, lifeless. She seems to stare out at you, jaw broken and hanging. The monster itself has a mixed expression of horror at its actions and savage triumph.  "Come this way," sounds cheerful and curious about what's around the next corner. Penny turns in toward the dark, gothic village setting. "Now is that what they're paying to see?" She looks at the broken kid-statue, arms folded, head tilted - judging. She walks to it's side - not to get a closer look but maybeb to keep out of it's direct line of sight.  Keene, meanwhile, blunders forward and transposes himself between Penny and the statue -- reading her body language, knowing how this game works. He stares at something inconsequential off to the side of the statue, doing his best cow-eyed tourist impression. "This reminds me of that movie, with the guy," he says. Keene works for Clear Channel. He knows all about inane banter.  The display of the Frankenstein's monster seems almost brooding. The girl's vacant eyes quite oddly seem to follow Penny's movements. You don't see them move... but wherever she is standing, the eyes seem to be looking.  OOC> Penny says, "I'd like to do another roll. Matter/Prime myself - raise my body temperature the better to melt the statue's two pair of eyes." Cornelius pages: How do you mean, exactly? Not sure how that effect would work. You paged Cornelius with 'As a foci-related effect: Wax melts at 138 degrees so via foci: Penny can write 138 degrees on her hands with the magic marker and radiate body heat of that temperature, using prime she can hurry along the damage to whatever trap is keeping the girl's spirit lodged in the figure.'. Cornelius pages: Mmm. You would need a lot of successes for body heat alone to have that impact. Unless you were very close to the statue. Like, right next to it on the display. Long distance to Cornelius: Penny intends to put her hands on it. Cornelius pages: Okay... then pose the action first and then I'll call for rolls.  Concealed briefly, Penny backs up into Keene and casually writes all over the backs of her hands. The Sharpie stink is strong. New. "Open the bag, just unzip it" Penny's turned Keene around to explain with brief gestures and in some other language what it is she intends to do. Melt the eyes, break the cage, catch the girl and run. Really fast.  Keene unzips the bag casually, making it look like he's looking for something. "Shoot, I should get a picture of this for Leroy," he says, but unzips the bag too far -- a box-shaped object falls out, sliding onto Penny's feet. It isn't very heavy. Meanwhile, various papers also fly out, causing Keene to chase after them and gather them up in his arms. "God damn it!" he says, fumbling with the various sized press releases he gathered off the fax machine for this purpose. Nothing like a klutz to draw attention away from a peyote-soaked maniac.  You paged Cornelius with 'this is where I'd turn and hit the statue.'. Cornelius pages: As a formality, please do me a favor and pose stepping on to the platform to do this. Long distance to Cornelius: Penny didn't see a platform in a desc. You paged Cornelius with 'Did I miss it?'. Cornelius pages: I am sorry. It's nothing specifically statted. And unneeded really. Don't sweat it.  When Penny steps close to the display and she passes the area where that is the boundry of the scene, the air ripples slightly and she simply vanishes from sight.  Cornelius pages: When you step across the boundry, you feel a faint tingling of your skin. Then you find yourself standing in a forest at night. In the distance is a small gothic village where the lights are lit. The air is extremely chill and there is a breeze blowing. In the distance you hear the sounds of an animal.  Keene continues scrambling around, picking up papers around him. Something in the back of his mind warns him something is wrong -- and he turns, seeing (or rather, not seeing) Penny. He keeps picking up the papers, putting them all in the bag and zipping it back up. For a few moments, Keene considers the situation. What to do?  He decides to try something -- Keene picks up the box-shaped object he'd left on the floor (actually, a very small hamster cage, complete with wheel) and eases it past the threshhold of the boundary of the scene with his shoe, waiting to see if anything happens.  You paged Cornelius with 'You think I'd be able to tell if I just stepped into the spirit world? awareness roll?'. Cornelius pages: Without the roll you can tell you're inside of some kind of pocket spirit realm. Like a mini-realm, subject to whatever rules were established during its construction. it seems very real however. Cornelius has disconnected. Sorry, Quiet is not connected. No one to page. OOC> Penny says, "... great."

      [Okay. I forgot to log this but it's plot so I thought I should bring it up in paraphrased form.]  Pobble goes to library to do some drug related study. Woman (Anastasia) comes along, asking about Nylarathotep. This is obviously strange, but she states that she wants to talk about Cornelius.  Conversation ensues in the office, details are revealed on both sides. She, along with her 'colleagues' (An undisclosed group, who can sense magickal happening and have a talent for seeing the invisible. Apparently drawn to Pobble by some manner of soothsaying.)  Not a lot of new information, besides a replica of a medallion worn around Corni's neck that they have. It wasn't magickal as it was a copy, but they think its related to some kind of teleporation and or mind attacking. It seems that Cornelius worships something called Nylarathotep. This suggests that he is in fact a Nephandi.  They are going to try and get the real medallion and bring it to us for inspection.   Based on the outcome of the subsequent transactions and trust building, details as to this faction (in which the spokesperson is a Violin Instructor) may follow.  Yay. Sorry about the log-forgetting.

      [Five days before Compton awoke to find a crumpled printout of an eBay auction stuffed in his shirt. From the scribbled notes in Hiro’s barely legible stupor-speek, Compton began stalking what is listed as, “Jesse James’ 1875 Schofeild Pistol *MINT*”.]  You keep repeatedly checking the auction and find that as the minutes tick by, it would seem that no one has noticed your bid is presently the highest one in. Each second going is a little more painful than the last until it seems like pure agony before it indicates that the auction has ended. You are the winner. The site instructs you that the seller of the item will contact you to arrange for payment as well as delivery. The auction indicated payment should be by PayPal with the different made up in the auction price and what PayPal takes out by the buyer. Shipping would be FedEx and would be free.  Sitting hunched over the keyboard in the dark like a decrepit gargoyle. His weathered features lit by the monitor in the depth of the Library. He pokes at the keyboard angrily with a bony finger, grumbling and swearing at the PC, willing it to respond quicker - the options hidden in arcane nooks of digital construct. His prize in peril he jabs at the space bar and the 'BID' bar depresses on the screen sending his last attempt to thwart Mr. X's attempts of stealing his prize.  8,000 bones Compton thinks to himself. "Fuck, better get a receipt for this." he mumbles to himself, remembering Keene's last tirade about expense accounts.  Quickly Compton clicks his way over to PayPal. Although technically versed and fairly PC-savvy for a guy pushing 70, he still isn't very smooth about it. His brow wrinkled with frustration, and hands clammy with anxiety. He realizes he's almost in shock, 'I finally found it' he thinks to himself as he goes through a 10 second reverie of the events that have brought him up to this point over a lifetime, as he slips a AmEx card from his pocket. The name on it reads Cally Grant, for anyone keeping score and he bashes in the numbers completing the transaction.  You wait a moment and then refresh the screen. PayPal indicates the payment has successfully gone through to the seller. There is a moment later when you see the little icon in the corner of the screen that indicates you have e-mail.  "Clickity-click, Babah-trick." Compton says as a form of personal computer mantra and opens Pine, to view the message of the end of a quest.  Congratulations Buyer!  We appreciate your prompt payment for Item #19390712348723, Jesse James Revolver for the price of $8,000US. We will send out your package via Federal Express next day shipping. A tracking number for your package will be provided tomorrow. We appreciate your business and will provide positive feed back on the next business day.  Thank you for doing business with Western and Indian Relic Brokerage Exchange!  Compton sits back, angling the ancient office backwards and depositing his bare feet next to the monitor on the desk. Folding his arms behind his head, he gazes at the long eerie shadows cast up the walls and bookcases of the library and rare grin cracking his features.  "I found it." he thinks to himself, "Finally, after all these years, a real Relic." HE even thinks the word capitalized. Most of his young companions wouldn't get it, what he's feeling. They haven't spent their lives searching. Their years with disappointment after disappointment... Don't realize how rare real power is... since most of those fuckers can do shit without even trying... and slowly the grin disappears in to his normal grimace.   Closing his eyes he pictures Jesse James' 1875 Schofeild Calvary Pistol hanging on his bedroom. "I'll have to make a mount for It." he tells the shadows idly.  The next day drags on like so much molasses crawling up hill in artic temperatures. Sure, you have other things to do but nothing sucks worse than having to wait for something you REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want. Just like when you were a kid. An e-mail arrives, as promised indicating the FedEx tracking number (888922781982 if you're interested) and the positive feedback is also delivered (A pleasure to do business with. Real asset to EBay. A++++++++!!!!).  Unfortunately for the seller and FedEx those tidbits of info are lost on Compton. Sure he could figure it out and do his bit to join the eBay cult or follow his treasures progress but neither function is in Compton's bag of Web surfing tricks. So instead he bids his time surfing for free porn with Hiro's pile of free passwords and polishing of a 40 of Cash's plunk. As the day crawls on he begins to grind his teeth more and more. His old jaw clacking annoyingly for anyone in earshot.  Mercifully the day ends and the new day dawns, bringing the time when the revolver should arrive. FedEx priority guarantees that a package shall arrive by 10:30 local time the next day. So when ten thirty comes and goes, it's a little bothersome but not terrible. What sucks is the day continues on and on... with no sign of the delivery truck.  As the sun rises and falls, so does Compton's spirits until him descending in to the depths of a murderous brooding. Spitting bile and sarcasm with the odd tirade at the expense of any number of unrelated parties. Eventually he grabs the old handset in the library hooked up to Pa Bell, the line already ringing through to 1-800-Go-Fed-Ex without any dialing, the tracking number printed out by the Raven dot-matrix in the corner.  The phone rings for a long time. "Thank you for calling Federal Express. If you have your tracking number, please press one and enter it. Press two for customer service."  Compton goes to hit one, then realizes that's not going to work with the 1950's era rotary he's working with, and just sits tight assuming at some point a live voice will get on the line.  Eventually the phone routes the call to an operator. "Thank you for calling Federal Express. This is Rhonda. Can I have your tracking number please?"  Compton very tensely reads off the string of numbers, ready to hear any number of excuses: tied up in traffic, typo'd address, stuck in the red tape, it was a firearm after all...  Some clickety-clickety on the other end. You can hear her sharp intake of breath. "Excuse me sir. I need to transfer you to a supervisor." And before you can even respond, you hear that mind dulling muzak all these companies have during internal holds. Eventually, on your 90th birthday, the phone picks up. "Sir? My name is Sean and I'm a team leader here with Federal Express. I have some... news regarding your package."  "Oh?" Compton manages, surprisingly with some control, despite a clenched jaw and white knuckling the receiver, ("No you don't you fuckers... not after being this close" he thinks to himself.)  "The plane that was carrying it from Santa Fe experienced some... difficulties and crash landed in Utah near the Salt Lake.." The supervisor says with some trepidation in his voice. "The plane lost most of its load before it crashed... we have recovery teams out there but it could take some time."  Compton is stunned. He just stares at the phone, mouth agape.  "Who did this?" he asks oddly, already making his own assumptions. Then, "How long...?' and finally, "Where is my gun sparky?"  "/Sir/. We're working on this. There are a lot of packages that are missing. They're all important to FedEx. We're more than willing to reimburse you for the value of your item up to its fullest cost. I would be happy to send you that form out." The young man says on the other end of the phone.  "Look 'son'... Cash won't cover it. We're talking a life time here. Cosmic chances." his facade of civility is quickly eroding, "Fuck, someone like you'd never understand... Just tell me, where the gun is." "We don't know. The packages are spread out over a sixty mile area. When the cargo hold of the plane shattered, it lost packages all over the place. They could be anywhere... in the desert... in mountains. I'm sorry." And the young man does sound sorry, really. Probably been getting this all day.  "Fine. What 60 mile area then. I'll find it myself." The anger bleeds away in to the psycho-scary seriousness that is always more scary than the wild maniac. Something about his tone makes you believe he'll do it too.  "Ahh..." The young man seems caught off guard by the request for a moment. "Let me find out for you sir. Please hold." And before you can respond, you're in Muzak land.  Compton digs around under the desk idly while waiting and is rewarded with a half-bottle of rye in a milk crate.  The line is picked up. "Sir? It occurred in the area of Grand Junction, Utah. That's where the plane finally landed. It was approaching from the south west... “The young man responds. Then, as if to make up for it. "You know... you can submit the claim anyway. This way, if you don't find your package... you still get your money back."  Compton's mouth curls up wickedly thinking about the AmEx card in the trash bin now, "Nah, that's alright... but tell me, what, happened to the plane?"  "Honestly sir, I'm not entirely sure. It's not something they really tell us. But if you're really going out there, I imagine you'll find out." The young man finally responds.  Compton hangs up without further ado. Looking at the piece of space junk in the middle of the Library, he says, "Well, old man. Looks like it's time for a road trip."

      The next day, when Compton climbs out of the fart sack he putters through his morning absolutions with more direction and urgency than usual. Avoiding most his collegiates, which isn't at all difficult as 20-something junkies are notoriusly night-hawkish, he starts to collect the odds and sods he takes on his road trips. Almost ritualistically after all these years. Such things as a bottle of Canadian Club, some charcoal, spray paint, rope, multi-tool, and some arcane choices from his library. Lastly he dons his ever present army coat and rolls some of the bodies laying around the Loft for some cash.   On his way out the door he leaves a note on the fridge as an afterthough, it reads:         Gone to get my gun. -C.  Out on the street, bright and early. The only thing stiring in the slums are the odd alley cat. Compton unpacks a can of spray paint and marks out a roughly rounded square on the sidewalk, and then puts an H in the middle. Next he digs out a piece of pink paper which he sets alight with a cheap BIC. Dropping it to the ground where it burns out on top of the rough depiction of a Honda symbol and looks at his watch, quietly counting down the seconds.  [Willpower] Compton spends a Willpower point.  Compton rolls intelligence+occult (8 dice) at a difficulty of 7:        -1-       4 Achieving 5 successes, resulting in a phenomenal success!  There is a quiet in the air. Like a collective holding of breath before something incredible is going to happen. A sense of anticipation fills the air. And it happens. There is a rushing sound, like that of air being displaced. You see some faint glow, almost like a short aurora borealis before its there. The ugly little Honda Element sitting there. The window is open. There is a bag of groceries on the passenger seat and the keys are still in the ignition. It would seem someone had just gotten home from shopping. In the back are several more bags of food.  "Sweet." is his simple appraisal of the situation and collects his stuff. Dropping it in the back amongst the sundries of suburban life he greets his rather homely travel companion, "Hey toots. Good to see ya again. Wanna go for a ride?"  Compton gets in without waiting for an answer. He's not crazy you know. Well, not that way. Indeed, the car does not respond to your words. At least, not immediately. When you turn the key in the ignition, it comes to life. The engine makes that purring sound that a new foreign car makes. It has all the fixin's. Power steering, power windows, power seats, air conditioning, a CD player and a CD collection (Complete works of Billy Joel, Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand). The seats are leather and it still has that new car smell.  Compton slips on the Barbra as a guilty pleasure, safe in the knowledge that the kids are all near dead right now and it is safe to do so.  'Send in the Clowns' is on when COmpton hits the Highway heading in to the sunrise.  WEATHER REPORT: The clouds overhead begin to move off, leaving clear skies.  It takes about forty minutes to clear through all of the streets and mini-highways before hitting actual interstate highway. There's nothing quite as freeing as good music, windows open and a vehicle on cruise control to really make one appreciate a road trip. About two hours in to your trip, in the distance, you can see that there might be some fairly unpleasant weather as the clouds are gray looking and the wind blowing in to your window carries the taste of moisture on it, the threat of rain.  Of cource there is. This is fucking Oregon... Compton thinks. Suddenly missing the relativly temperatness of Ontario.  But his mind isn't just on these trivial things. He's on a mission afterall. In search of his lost Grail... fucking FedEx. As he thinks this he reaches over and rummages through his sachel for a clunky looking piece of equipment. From the looks of the black thermo-resin casing with fake chrome trim, dating it at least 30 years old it is some kind of primitive radio device. He plunks it on the spacious dash and fiddles with a tuning knob until a steady dull beep comes through clearly.  What Compton is doing is setting up a link with his Patron, Pa Bell. A Spirit Guide have you, residing in the burnt out shell of Telstar-1.   For the moment it's silent. Perhaps simply too far from the mark for you to get any kind of read for Pa Bell to work with. Fortunately for you that your ride through Oregon is mercifully short, just a small part of the trip. A rainy part of it. A fairly unimpressive part of it but it's done and over with as the I-82 takes you through to Idaho. Yes. Idaho. Home of the potato. Woop de shit. Look? There's a sign on the side of the road. Fifteen miles to the site of the World's Largest Potato!  Compton is sorely tempted. Having something of a weird compulsion to buy campy postcards... but no. That would be staged as he doesn't have to actually stop there, it'd be frivilous. Shame really.  Okay, so we're in Idaho. It's been a few hours and he's drank a quart of the Sunny D he's found in one of the bag. Weird stuff. Like new age Tang.   He decides it's time for a rest and pulls off at the first Gas n Gulp he finds.  Around noon, you just can't hold it any longer. You pause on the side of the road and contribute to the environment by providing liquid fertilizer for the plant life that grows along the highway. As for the food part, it would seem that the person who owned this car was most assuredly not on Atkins or any other diet. There are some frozen things in there that will surely be nastified relatively soon and are candidates for pitching. But this individual also has a collection of chips, cookies, two bags of premium blend coffees and a ton of soft drinks. There is also a pathetically small bottle of Sunny D.  Frozen goods, kindly opened and donated to the crawling/flapping wildlife in Idaho before Compton remounts and goes looking for a gas station before the appearance of the buggy starts to get on his nerves.  It only takes about twenty more minutes before you are able to find a gas station. Bob's Pump and Dump. Yes. That's the name. An honest to goodness, independant gas station. You pull in to the place and see the one lone pump sitting sourly in the middle of the lot. When you pull in, a fairly unsettling looking man in his mid fifties wearing overalls and a baseball cap approaches. It might be stereotypical but it's true. And he's there. Watching you with washed out blue eyes set in to the soft folds of his pig-like face.  "Fill 'er up." Compton says, not one to judge being washed out and wrinkly himself.  "Ya happen to see any kind of boxes falling from the sky of late?" He asks, figuring why the hell not? He must be getting close, and he really has nothing else going for him in this matter.  The man just stares at you for a moment when you ask the question before he walks around to the side of the vehicle. Flipping the gas tank cover off, he removes the pump and sticks it in the hole, holding the handle tightly. The old mechanical display shows the dollars and gallons rolling by. "Bahkses? I ain't seen any Bahkses fallin' from tha sky... sorry mister. You'll need to find crazy shit like that further south." Indeed, Provo, UT is about seven hours away yet. :'aint from round ere' so to speak. Really, excpet for looking it up on Mapquest the night before, he hasn't looked at a map or asked directions once. Kinda going on blind fate here. %r%rComps pays up and get the Yuppie-mobile rolling. South it is. Compton 'aint from round ere' so to speak. Really, excpet for looking it up on Mapquest the night before, he hasn't looked at a map or asked directions once. Kinda going on blind fate here.   Comps pays up and get the Yuppie-mobile rolling. South it is.  The stones grind under the tires and a small cloud of dust is all that remains of you at the station. The porky fellow just watches, shaking his head in disbelief. The highway eventually turns straight south for a while. The scenery changes, becoming a little less green. The sun begins to set as night falls over the country, leaving you with the remaining four hours of your trip to Provo to be done in the darkness of night.

      You enter the waxworks. The large double doors swing open for you. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Main Room(#1957RJ)          This room is not particularly large. Just an entrance room, really. Heavy black curtains hang over the windows in front, shutting out almost all of the ambient light from the world beyond. The room is lit only by real candles and gas lamps. The air carries an old, almost must scent to it, giving you the sense of walking in to a building centuries old, even though it is a relatively new rennovation.         The walls are mostly wood panelled but not in any particular order. Chaos seems to be theme of the decor. The ceilings are high. Ridiculously high seeming, as if they extended far beyond human vision, in to the pitch depths up above. Something may be lurking up there, even now. In several spots there shelves are set in to the wall. Each shelf is empty. The books themselves appear to be sunken in to the walls, giving the room an even odder feel. The floors are completely bare of any sort of coverings. Just finely polished stone. In the center of the main room is a series of ten chairs. The really nice kind, with deep seats and thick velvet cushions. There is a circular table in the middle of them with two books displayed.         Off to the left side is a smallish office. In the back center of the room, you can see a pair of doors, oaken. One door has the face of a smiling demon, a brightly polished brass nameplate under it says Fiction. One door has the face of an angry, almost leering demon, another brightly polished brass nameplate under this one says Fact. There are no visible handles, just a hole in each open mouth with tongues sticking out.                                 +views available                                  Contents: Polar-bear William Matt Petra Zoe Suliman Cornelius Read Me Obvious exits: Fiction (FI)  Fact (F)  Out (O) (OOC) Zoe would think not, no.

(OOC) Cornelius says, "Just checking." (OOC) William says, "Man. Nobody saw Mulan."  Compton slinks in. The collar of his old army coat turned up against the shitty 'Vale weather. In his hand is one of those new fangled super-tiny cam-corders. Pretty high tech swag for an old bastard. He glances around at the exhibits with bloodshot eyes before going straight in to recording. Polar-bear's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. (OOC) Cornelius says, "We're not posing just yet Compton... waiting for the final consensus that we're ready." (OOC) Zoe hmms, "Cornelius - taking place before it opens? Right?" (OOC) Cornelius says, "I understand that to be the case, ja." Cornelius pages: How did you come to be here today? :) You paged Cornelius with 'By foot.  SNiffing around based on Penny's and Pobbles reports to the College.'. Cornelius pages: Mm. Right now we're about to have a blow up party. (OOC) Cornelius says, "Well, begin posing kids. Compton just walked in." (OOC) Petra says, "Um..." (OOC) Matt says, "Well appearently Compton's being allowed to horn in on our scene. So let's go." Matt hands out the contents of the backpacks, giving Petra and Suli the extra radio detenators. "Get them on the villans first, we blow those, then deal with the others. Jacob arrives with Zoe. The big guy tries to look small an inconspicuous, or as close as he can manage. The museum is quiet. In the center of the main room is a massive display set up that is covered by a large white tarp. Petra nods, taking it with one hand, shotgun held in another. She whirls at the sound of motion and levels the shotgun at the sounds. She is, of course, wearing a mask. She simply nods, then, and keeps moving. "Let's do this." as soon as they're inside, Matt decides that another form might be better for this and shifts to crinos. Matt's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. With Jacob, Zoe moves quietly, a rifle in hand, and follows behind the others. Keeping an eye on things as Matt hands out the charges, she glances to the tall guy who came in with her, a slight nod given to him before she moves once more. Suliman accepts his set of detonators and then moves out behind Petra. Nothing more to see here, despite the utterly blank expression on his face. Jacob watches Matt. Hmmm. Good idea. He takes the hint. Jacob's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. Matt stalks to the new display and rips the cover off of the thing; "I think I know, but let's bee sure." "Well, why not," says the guy who was even taller than Jacob, at some point. And he too changes. In the middle of the room is a scene of Central Park near the fountain. It is nearly a perfect replica of it, down to the little blades of grass. Even the tree seems real. But that's not the horrific part. The awful part is that there are several hundred bodies all piled about in the middle of the park. Each of them appear to have suffered a different fate. Disemboweling. Burning. Dismemberment. Crucifixion. Bludgeoning. Animal attack. Each one is a master craft of work, with the horror of the demise painted in to the face of each one shown here. There is not one peaceful soul. For anyone who troubles to count, there are six hundred sixty five dead here.  Some of these faces resemble pictures taken of those who have died over the past few weeks. In the center of it all is a rabbi standing before an altar. There is a pillow on the altar with two gold rings.  It's not that he disappears exactly. He's there, sorta. Just on the edge of your periphery vision the old bum hovers. You may see him, but quickly your vision is distracted to something else and when you look again, he's somewhere else. Slippery, elusive, Compton. Matt frowns; "Thought I saw someone. Be careful." He looks at the sculpture, and takes out four charges, calmly slapping them on the thing. "I have a present for asshole. These are coded to a seperate code. Suli. Jacob, Petra - take fact. The rest of you with me in fiction. Petra nods. "On it." She looks around once, taking the right flank as they approach the doors to Fact. A faint shudder runs through her. Suliman nods. "We're on it." He takes up a flanking position on Petra easily within arm's reach, but behind her. Vanguard-Walker looks around and sniffs the air. He nods and shuffles along with Petra. Petra levels the shotgun at the door and murmurs, "One of you open it and step back. This may get hot."  ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Compton.............Dirty old man. Height: 1.8m Weight: 67 kg.

I think the bite of the door mechanism might be more firm today than the last foray. StormcrowSTandsAlone hands Petra a long length of the detcord. "Use this to cut a door if you need to.

StormcrowSTandsAlone enters the oaken wooden door marked Fiction. StormcrowSTandsAlone has left. Vanguard-Walker says, "How 'bout we just knock it in?"

Vanguard-Walker jumps forward to grab the demon jaw, top and bottom, in an effort to pry them open. (OOC) Jumpstart says, "...and there was an earthquake when he landed." (OOC) StormcrowSTandsAlone says, "Heh." Zoe hears the hiss, her head turning to look back at the others to see what's happening before turning back to warn Jumpstart, eyes widening. Hands tighten around the rifle, her gaze cautiously glancing around.

Jumpstart's big, /very/ big -- but fast enough. No snappyhand for him. ((NEENER, FUCKER!)) Jumpy's door, however, remains closed. StormcrowSTandsAlone growls and moves to help Suli. He manages to pry the damn thing open, and as he does Suili's hand comes free and the door clicks open. ((Give me two people on this one.)) He moves to the other door, and sticks his own hand in to open it as soon as Jumpstart and someone else are in position. (OOC) StormcrowSTandsAlone says, "that was me. sorry." Suliman snarls a bit in saying, "Thanks." He stoops to retrieve his explosives and growls, "Let's go." He then shoves open the door.

(OOC) StormcrowSTandsAlone says, "Guys? There's some confusion. Vanguard was on the door, but I didnt' see it. what're you doing, V-W?"

It cracks a bit in the middle but it manages to hold against the force of their blows. The leering demon face seems to mock them.  The bum stands against the wall, over by the door, slouching in a patently James Dean kinda way... if James Dean looked like Jack Palance with a mullet. Arcane energies drift and weave their way around him, making him hard to spot by anyone actually looking for him, never mind those engaged in para-military activities. The cam-corder in his hand, silently recording in to a next-generation flash-ROM.

StormcrowStandsAlone takes out some of the detcord he's carrying and calmly frames the door, attaching a detenator. (( Get back.)) Quiet pages: You get a very clear, very compelling command in your mind to drop the camera and leave the museum at once. Zoe watches, then as Storm starts to set the detcord, she begins to move back even before he says anything. Petra steps back when commanded, silent. Focused. Stone-faced. She's not saying anything, just holding that shotgun. Suliman steps out of the way himself. Now at last he decides to change, slipping into a form similar to the others. StormcrowStandsAlone says, "((Change in plans. When I blow this. Everyone do this gallery first. Haul /ass/ - I want charges on every one of the villans as quickly as possible." Suliman's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. Of course, growling is not American English, nor the Queen's. But Jumpstart sure understands, too. He more or less shields the women, although they can still shoot around him and stuff. Yeah, stuff. Unseen, a little rat slips into the building, squeezing under the door perhaps. He sticks to the shadows, scurrying around as he takes in whats going on, his alert little eyes dancing over the room and its occupents. When he sees the.. werewolves? He freezes in place. When Suliman goes wolfish as well, he just stares. Jesus. You paged Quiet with 'How did Petra detect me? (Arcane 5)'. (OOC) Khinjaar Arramil says, "Wolfish?!" (OOC) Clipped Ear says, "Well.. you said similar. :p" (OOC) Zoe giggles.. try kitty, Clipped. (OOC) Clipped Ear says, "Oh. Boy!" That little rodent stare gets even wider as he notices that is indeed not a wolf.. but a cat. He doesn't stick around for much longer, running back the way he came and slipping out under the door. OOC) Clipped Ear heads out. "Everyone okay with that?" OOC) Zoe laughs and nods. OOC) StormcrowStandsAlone says, "sure." OOC) Petra nodnods. Zoe rolls alertness+perception (5 dice) at a difficulty of 8:  3 9 2 3 7 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Clipped Ear leaves the waxworks. Clipped Ear has left. Quiet pages: With a ridiculous roll against a very high difficulty. You paged Quiet with 'Fine.'. Quiet pages: It's the way the dice crumble. I'm sorry. There is a sound of an explosion as the door goes when the charge explodes. Splinters fly everywhere. That which remains of the door is on fire but it is easily passable now. Zoe grabs a few charges, and then readies herself to help once the door is blown to run inside and set them before getting out as quickly as possible as Storm says.  Compton packs up and leaves as quietly as he came. Popping the data-chip in to his pocket and strangley leaving the camera on a ledge as he leaves.  Petra pages: He did not follow the command. You paged Quiet with 'No worries.'. You paged (Quiet, Petra) with 'You get a very clear, very compelling command in your mind to drop the camera and leave the museum at once." Camera left, and Compton gone.'. To (Compton, Quiet), Petra pages: Whatever. Be a twink. You paged (Quiet, Petra) with 'Nice. Have it your way. Isn't like the scene is worth anything. Sorry Quiet.'.

      The Brewery - Main Room(#1215RJMs)          A light murmur of voices often can be heard upon entrance to the pub, everything from politics to the sports game shown on the television to the side of the bar. Tables rest in a pattern that would only make sense to a designer cursed with insanity and hatred of servers. There are several tables that line the wall in which the main door rests, but as they come to the door, they arc out onto the main floor and dissolve into a jumble of wooden chairs and formica tabletops. Yet, perhaps to aid those seeking certain tables, each tabletop bears the image of a certain logo for a type of beer. One can see a chubby weasel caught in mid-flight with the words 'Fat Weasel' written underneath beside the more traditional logo of Budweiser. This bit of kitsch is forgone, though, when it comes to the bar itself. The bar is made of solid oak and polished until it holds a warm glow. This glow is constantly sustained by the rag held in the hand of the harried soul tending to the drinks and woes of the patrons of this establishment. The occasional waitress and more intrepid soul can be seen venturing near the strange cauldron forged of shining steel and stranger intent. There is a spigot on the side from which those waitresses who dare its shining bulk draw its blood to serve to those of adventurous bent.         There is a door set in the back wall. A door that bears a white sign which states that none may enter. Still, waitresses and the bartender can be seen making their way to the door and slipping beyond. These journeys into the forbidden are brief, but always do those who return from its hidden wonders bear a broad smile and a pair of mugs filled with liquid gold that go only to patrons who seem to bear friendship and/or kinship to the staff of this establishment.                           >                            Contents: Anastasia Morgan Lily Nathan Obvious exits: Back Room    Out    Morgan is looking at you.  Nathan is looking at you.  In the far corner of the room, Anastasia pulls a book from her satchel out and sets it down. WHen a waiter finally comes by her table, she simply says, "Tea," in a barely-breath of whispery voice. She could well stare holes into the man's back as he departs, waiting to get him away from her.  Pobble saunters into the pub, coat pulled tightly about him to relieve the outside chill. He pauses near the entrance, sidestepping to avoid becomming a barrier to further entrance and slumping just a touch. After stiffling a yawn he begins to pick his way across to the counter.  Lily is looking at you.  Morgan hrrms as Ana enters, watching her settle and brusquely request tea. He then watches the polar bear that is Pobble make his way to the counter, but the scrutiny doesn't last long, strangely enough, but then again, look how ~he~ is dressed! Either a Fair employee or a SCA freak, who knows? He returns his attention to Lily and Nathan. for whom he makes room for upon settling at Lily's table.  Anastasia is looking at you.  "Good, then you haven't yet heard the unflattering ones." Nathan says with a quick grin before moving away from the bar towards the table in which Lily sits. "Thank you, my dear lady. Let me introduce myself. I am Nathan de Laval, and as you said, tailor by trade while finishing my degree at the university." When he reaches her table, he offers his hand to her, glancing towards Morgan as the other takes his seat. For now, the entrance of Anastasia goes unnoticed, as does the strangely dressed Pobble, his attention upon the two before him.   Lily considers Nathan's outstretched hand warily, as if the tailor might be concealing a rabid, starving Doberman up his sleeve, but shakes nonetheless, though her grip lingers in his only so long as the absolute minimums of courtesy demand. Not one for touching, our Lily; she flickers a fainly apologetic smile to him, murmuring, "Lily Black, florist. A pleasure to meet you. Will you join us?" She darts a look at Anastasia, adding a respectful nod, but makes no motion to disturb the other woman; Pobble's coat receives the fleeting hint of a grin.  Pobble settles against the counter, using it to hold up his tired weight as he scratches his chin and waits for service. Coffee is ordered, and a silver nail is rapped against the bartop quietly as he waits. Attention flicks across the room from table to table, searching for the familiar and pausing in places. Such as the dashing rogue, Lily and finally stopping with Anastasia. Beverage arrives, and the blue haired gent begins to spoon in an abundance of sugar.     ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Pobble..............Tallish, thin guy. Blue braided hair. Facial tattoos. Strange attire. Height: 5'10 Weight: 140 lb Age:        App: 2  Cha: 3  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anastasia...........Conservative, classy dresser. A tasteful young woman who bears herself well. Often seen with a backpack on, or carrying a violin case Height: 5'7" Weight: 135 lb Age:        App: 3  Cha: 3  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Morgan..............A powerfully built man, 6'5, glacier blue eyes and blond hair with platinum streaks. Height:      Weight:        Age: 21     App: 3  Cha: 2  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lily................A bit Cabaret. A bit creepy. Reserved and accented. Height: 5' 5 Weight: 110 lb Age:        App: 3  Cha: 2  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nathan..............Green hair, gold eyes, dark skin, tall Height: 6'8" Weight: 200lbs Age: 24     App: 3  Cha: 3   -----------------------------------[ - ]------------------------------------  And the strange woman in the corner looks over and sighs. And sighs again. And Ana looks towards the table where the others are, and sighs. And she looks to her hands, and suddenly decides she'd better do something with them. So, she pulls out a chessboard from her satchel and sets it down. Some frat boy a few tables over starts cackling at something on TV, and the sound causes Ana to almost jolt in her seat, and she spills a few of the chess pieces on the ground. Hurriedly, she stoops to get them.  Pobble finishes spooning and stirring in time to observe the peices clattering to the floor. Carefully taking up the mug he makes his way across and sets the coffee down on Anastasia's table before crouching to assist with retrieving a stray bishop from behind the chair opposite the woman. Offering a smile of greeting he deposits the peice on the board and gestures to the chair, "May I?"  "I was going to play chess," answers Ana blandly, her voice a dull and emotionless tone. "But that can wait. Have a seat, if you wish, Doctor. I might have to look at things, though, on the chessboard as we speak, so I hope you do not get upset with me."  Pobble quirks a brow in query but slides down onto a seat, resting elbows on the table and centering his coffee. One settled, he raises the mug to softly blow ripples across the surface of the liquid as he looks across at Anastasia curiously. "I have some news.." he begins.   At your table, Anastasia answers, immediately, and she takes her glasses off, looking at you with those intensely focused grey eyes. "News? Oh yes. I have some news too, but I suspect you may already know it, so I hope you'll forgive just some curious girl for not being so efficient."  At your table, Pobble smirks as he blows the coffee, setting the cup down as he stares back across at you. "Of course, you're just some curious girl." he observes wryly, wiping a trailing drop of brown liquid from the side of the mug before it hits the table. "Did you want to start or should I?"  Lily sits down at table in the corner.  Nathan sits down at table in the corner.  Never let it be said that Nathan isn't a gentleman, even when the lady proves to be so.. shy. For the moment she takes his hand, he bends over it, kissing the air above before letting it go, his smile once more easy upon his lips. "The fair Lily. I have heard a touch about you too, and your way with plants." With the offer of a seat, he looks from her to Morgan, as if to be sure all is ok before accepting with a grateful look. "Thank you both, don't mind that I do." The books gain a look of curiousity as to what the woman might have been studying, yet be it against his ways to ask outright. The mug in his hands gains another sip as he settles into the seat offered.  At your table, Anastasia replies softly, "Well, I could tell you what I learned, or you could tell me what you learned, but I don't want to speak of things here. He's a wizard - he could be listening anywhere, you know... and even I would be hesitant to risk that."  At your table, Pobble nods slowly, finally taking a sip of the steaming brew before he replies. "Indeed anywhere, so how would you get around that?" he asks with a crooked smile, as if having ideas to this end but more interested in entertaining suggestions.  Lily's eyes widen almost comically at Nathan's courtly display, and she rubs the back of her hand in surprise. "I...oh." Ah, yes; how articulate. "Plants, yes." She offers another shy smile, hiding again behind her glass of liqueur. She lowers her voice, then, to converse at the table.  At your table, Anastasia toys with something on her shoulder, nothing there, but maybe is fixing her bra-strap. "What about that office?" she asks, seeming to be hesitant - and though the chess game is not set up, she certainly seems like she's playing it alraedy.  At your table, Pobble's gaze flicks across to the office, and he seems intrigued. "You work here or something?" he asks, looking back to you sidelong. Finger curls through the mug handle, rotating the cup about in place.  At your table, Anastasia looks over there, and suddenly, turns back to you, her eyes narrowing a little. "I meant yours." She's peppering words around, seeing what you'll pick up, and what you won't.  At your table, Pobble shrugs just slightly, response delayed by the consumption of coffee. Keeping it held before his face he regards you over the rim with a half-smile. "That office is no more secure than this place."  Anastasia narrows her eyes at the man across from her, and seems utterly frustrated. WQuickly, and with only the words spoken, "I shall return," she pushes herself away from the table, stands, and turns to stride decidedly across the room to the tall SCA guy.  Pobble seems oblivious to the frustration and settles back, holding mug with both hands in his lap as he watches Anastasia head off to the other table without a word.  Morgan orders honey liquor himself, the only popular brand being Baronjaeger for some odd reason. Bah, American paletes. He looks up as Ana approaches him, nodding to her briefly, taking in her countenance.  Nathan settles, then falls into quiet conversation, the mug lifted to his lips and sipped from at times as he banters back and forth with both Lily and Morgan. The smile never leaves his face, growing at times with amusement.  Anastasia folds her hands before her waist and starts to speak softly to Morgan, looking back over to her table.  Morgan arches a brow, then whispers back to Anastasia.  Anastasia answers to Morgan, flatly, "No. But that is not a thing to worry about. If anyone asks, they can speak to me directly as to my rationale. Thank you, and good day." Just as quickly as she approached, the strange girl turns and starts back towards her table.  Nathan glances up as Anastasia arrives to the table, giving her a respectful nod before she begins to speak so quietly with Morgan. As they talk, he turns back to continue the conversation with Lily.  Morgan arches both brows now and lets them settle, but he's not going to dwell on it. He lets Ana go as she came, returning his attention to his companions.  Pobble watches with the faintest hint of a smile on his lips between sips from his cup. He's half done by the time the woman returns, waiting while he pushes his beverage from side to side idly. As Anastasia reapproaches he raises a questioning eyebrow.  At your table, Anastasia settles down again, and sighs heavily. "I suppose we can do that," answers Ana, who pushes her hair out of her face, and reaches for her satchel. "But would you first be so kind as to help me to carry my things? My shoulders are rounded from all of this walking with these books."  At your table, Pobble drains the last from his cup and nods, "Why of course Miss." he says, pushing back his chair before stopping and tilting his head, "Do what though? You say that as if I made a suggestion?" Phineas comes in to the bar, folding an umbrella up under his arm and adjusting the muffler he has around his topcoat. It is chilly outside, and it threatens rain.  Pobble sits across from Anastasia although he appears to be making ready to stand. An empty coffee mug sits before him and he seems to be too absorbed with his conversing to notice a new arrival.  Morgan sits with Nathan and Lily, drinking and conversing quietly.  At your table, Anastasia pushes a few books to you. There is a notebook, a small organizer, and the strangest of all, a largish old tome, something musty with cracked bindings. To those that are magickally aware, there is something extra about it - it seems imbued with a magick all its own. "Just those, please... I think I can handle the rest."  At your table, Pobble doesn't appear to notice anything untowards about the books and trails a silver tipped fingertip across the strange tome before sweeping up the pile and holding them against his chest with both hands as he stands.  [FAE] Pobble glows briefly as he is enchanted.  Phineas wanders to a small table by himself. After all, you have to get warmed up a bit before you socialize.  Phineas sits down at table by the door.           Eyes, sharp and grey, shaped like rose petals, are piercingly deep, taking in the world around her with cool calculation and profound intelligence, yet bearing a sparks of electricity - quick and vibrant.. This noblewoman fae is an embodiment of mystery, reminiscent of the glow of moonlight through foggy summer nights . A sparkle of diamonds against the midnight, her hair is a glittering deep violet hue, striped wide with shimmering silver streaks. Her hair is an array of tiny, thin braids, most of which are let to fall loose to her shoulders and reaching to mid-back, but with still more twirled up into a topknot and held in place by two onyx chopsticks. A ringed headpiece formed of delicate strands of twining mercurial tendrils rests above her forehead, an irridescent halo for a circlet. The circlet holds a glittering gem that reflects a spectrum of colors, depending on the light, set into a silver filagreed frame and resting just above her brow. This sidhe, like most of her kith, stands tall and proud, at nearly six feet tall but with a frail, limber frame. Her skin is ivory smooth, gentle and white, which stretches over her high cheekbones, broad forehead, and ears which taper out about two inches from the sides of her head into pointed tips. Those grey eyes seem to have stormclouds hidden in their gaze, ever shifting and sparking in their patterns. However, they are partly obscured by a tiny pair of silver-rimmed spectacles, half-moon in shape, perched upon the bridge of her slightly upturned nose. Her lips, soft and pink, seem to have a secretive smile to them, and her gaze seems to usually be partly on that which is at hand, and mostly somewhere else, as if daydreaming.          Her body is dressed simply - well, simply for one of her kith, as it were. Rich silks in purple and silver, softer than the wings of a butterfly, drape over her frame, gathered tightly below her slight breasts with a silver cord,and then allowed to flow down to the ground, concealing her feet. The cuffs of her robe fall just to her wrists in wide bell-like flares, decorated with embroidered roses and vines in silver thread. A silver crescent moon clasp, the traditional symbol of the noble house Eiluned, holds the black cloak that wraps loosely around her in place. The cloak she wears may appear just simply black at first, but at a closer look, you can see the stars glowing against the night-sky silk, sparkling dots that shine luminescently, even in the dark, and in perfect celestial patters, reflecting the map of the heavenly sphere.  >  At your table, Anastasia rises, without a second thought as you take the book, and simply says, "Come. We have things to talk about." Now it's on her terms, though, and she doesn't have to feel so awkward about her mortal body.  Pobble stands with a pile of books held in his arms. One moment he's smiling, the next he looks deeply confused. Glancing around the room with a look of realization that's not far away from 'God, I left the gas on'. Temporarily forgetting where he was heading to he looks across at Anastasia, narrowing his eyes as he tries to say something without taking a breath.  Morgan turns to look again in Ana's direction, nodding at Pobble.  [FAE] Morgan, a blue skinned, horned giant, with a 6+ foot long sword strapped to his back and a mouth full of canine teeth, nods to Pobble.  Lily's gaze lifts from her conversation to study Pobble, and her features still, schooled to impassivity.  [FAE] Lily, skeletal and shadowed, stares at Pobble without expression, offering the barest hint of a nod. Amusement shows in her gaze.  Nathan turns as does his tablemates, golden eyes finding the strangely dressed man standing near Anastasia's table. A quirk of a brow, and then he turns back to his conversation with the fair Ms. Black, laughter given by something said earlier.  Phineas is watching the table where the man is standing up, but Pobble is not object of his attention. Anastasia gets a smug little wave of recognition.  Pobble recovers from his momentary lapse of reason, patting the books in his arms with silver tipped fingers. He sways a little unsteadily, sniffs a few times and shrugs. Pupils that were wide to begin with look about the room intently, as if an earlier ingestion of chemicals had found its mark and he chuckles quietly to himsef, offering a finger waggle to the other table.  Anastasia reaches for her satchel and then, with her free hand, tugs at Pobble's coat. She looks over her shoulder, though, and stops moving for a moment. "Actually... " She starts biting her lip, though, hard, staring toward Phineas, whom she almost immediately spots. She doesn't reply to that wave, but says, "I have a better idea." Wihtout another word, she heads for the door, turning from time to time to look at Pobble, making sure he is coming along.  Anastasia pages: and since you're enchanted, you would know WHY she is reacting like that. Phineas has an air about him that is as chill as a bitter winter wind. Anastasia pages: very uncomfortable.  Pobble turns slowly and plods along after the departing woman, studying her back and clothing intently. Passing Phineas he gives the man a strange look, hugging his books tighter as he hurries on after his companion.  Phineas says, "Be seeing you, Miss Dvornik, on campus. You enjoy the night, eh?" He watches the young lady leave. "I am still waiting."  "Fuck off," states Ana, as blandly as any other word that comes out of her mouth. Her distaste for the man is evident, though, despite her emotionless tone. Now, for those who know Ana - her cursing like that - that's just unheard of. Jaws may now commence dropping.  Anastasia pushes open the door that leads out into the world and steps across the threshold as the door swings quickly shut in their wake.  Anastasia has left.  You push open the door and step out into the world to see...  Suburbs - Oak Parke(#710RJs) -= Gregor and Bard =-          A virtual smorgasbord of shops line the street, everything from the eccentric store that only the most daring of youths dare venture into to the more conservative clothing shop that declares that they have the best deals. One corner of the road has two rival tattoo and piercing shops. Whenever one declares their shop to be the best, the other counters with similar claims. There are photos of their work blown up in display windows, changing from day to day to the joy of window browsers.         The sidewalks are in decent condition; though they do show some of the wear and tear of age. The street itself is in much of the same condition, asphalt showing potholes every so often. The local politicians, of course, have declared that they will have better roadways soon enough available to motorists.   Contents: Anastasia Obvious exits: Dian Cecht DCI  The Brewery TB East on Gregor E  South on Bard S  North on Bard N  Pobble follows, seeming vaguely sympathetic and at the same time enraptured by the current goings on. He asks no questions as he follows after you, but does at times hold the books with one arm and attempt to reach out and touch the cloak..  [FAE] Anastasia's robes sweep at her feet, and she turns to look at you... everything seems like it's going in slow motion, like a really good hallucinogen. "Dr. Steve... I'm sorry... I couldn't stay with that man in there. We need to go someplace safe. I would like to go to the forest, as I have a friend out there who may be able to help."  Pobble's nose wrinkles at this, but he still seems captivated as you turn to look at him. Plastered with a strange lopsided smile he nods to aquiesce, "That sounds reasonable.." he states finally, once he's noticed that he was staring.  [FAE] She pushes some braids out of her face and nods, "Well, I don't know about taking you to my home... the others there might object, as things are very, very tense right now. And I couldn't stay in there... Forest. That is the best option, and I know of places where we will be safe to speak. It isn't far. Just a walk to the south."   Gabbi State Park - Hiking Trails          To the north, the trail grows wider just as the trees grow more and more thin. However, to the south it is a completely different stories. The vegetation grows more and more dense, covering both the ground and the sky, as branches from trees intertwine around the pathways.          People can still often times be seen making their way through the pathways, although not as often as they are up to the north, where the entrance of the state park actually lies. Various small animals become more numerous as well, peeking around the corners of trees, under a bush, or in the branches. If one is particularly lucky, they may even catch sight of a white-tailed deer that moved farther to the north than most of their kind.   Contents: Anastasia Obvious exits: Southwest    North    The woman seems to know her way through the woods, those woods that seem to just tingle with life, and those woods in which the occasional gnome tugs at your pant leg, or pixie tugs at your hair. Ana is very nonchalant about it, brushing them off like little gnats."  And she comes to a stop. "Here. Here will be fine. I apologize... again, I could not let that awful, cold man know my hideouts."  Pobble seems torn between the protrusion of new and fantastical fauna and the woman who leads him through their midst. He comes to a halt nearby and sets himself down on a decaying log. Still gazing he finally says, "What makes him so cold? He was.. disconcerting.." He shivers, pulling his yeti coat tighter about him.  "He does not believe in magick, and is a cold product of this modern world, of soulless and passionless doldrum. He is one who is the antithesis of wonder, he is stark, cold and rationalizes anything he cannot understand away... and for that, he is painful to be around," explains the sidhe, who now spreads her robes to settle on the grass, in a nice little patch. She draws her legs up under her, in a lotus position, and takes a few deep breaths. "This... this is much better."  Pobble looks around pusing his lips, "I am still not so sure." he says distantly, and after setting down the books on the log he retrieves a pad from his pocket and scrawls on it. After a moment of silent scribbling, punctuated by distractedly looking up at you, he nods. "Can never be too certain.." he says, studying the surroundings and pulling a vial from a deep inside pocket. Standing he heads off to a certain point and lets a drop of the clear liquid fall to the ground. Facing you, he heads in a circle, counting steps. While this could be some excuse to get a look from all angles he does seem to have some other plan in mind.  Now, Ana is certainly the curious fae. She watches closely, turning her head and then her body to follow your steps. If she can get away with going for it, she'll try to get a drop of liquid from the ground onto her fingertip, to examine it.  Pobble almost frowns at the trapping of the drop, but replaces it after finishing the circle. He seems to nod at something and deposits a drop on his own fingertip. The vial is sealed back up and replaced and the Doctor lights up a cigarette, closing his eyes as he takes a long slow drag.  Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:      2 Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success. Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:    -1-   Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  2     Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  Anastasia puts the drop to her nose and smells it, then darts out her tongue to take a tiny taste, then rubs it around in her fingertips, to get a feel for it. She's curious, ya know. Now, she turns again, and watches closely, intently. Little does she know what she just did.  Pobble holds a breath in for quite a while, finally exhaling and opening his eyes in time to see the ingestion of hallucinogenics. He tries his very best to stiffle the emerging grin that fights its way onto his lips. "I guess in a way, that is only fair." he observes.  Anastasia rolls perception+kenning (6 dice) at a difficulty of 6:      5     5 Achieving 4 successes, resulting in an exceptional success!  Of course, it won't hit her for another hour, and since she has never tasted this before, she has no idea what it is. She peers a little, and asks, "What did you just do?" It's not just the liquid. It's the feelings of weirdness she's getting from the air around you.  Pobble settles back on the log, tapping his cigarette and dispersing a small pillar of ash to the night breeze. "Just made sure that it'll take more than casual effort to observe us." He seems to notice that he's still staring, and does try not to, but can't really resist. You don't get to see this every day. At least, not until the hallucinogens kick in. "I made the trees dream that we're not here, and this is what they'll report."  Anastasia's eyes peer oddly at you, and she now seems a bit uneasy. "You ... made the trees dream?" She's not so sure about how well she likes that. The sidhe draws her knees up to her chest and leans forward, eyeing you carefully. She curls her ears outward, and then cranes her head, to look around, to see if anything is different. Just ot be sure, on her part. "Alas," says the fae, "If the trees cannot hear us, then perhaps it will be well to speak. And since I brought you here, I shall share with you what I have first." She draws a breath, and states, "The wizard is close to finishing his murders. Very close. But, while this may seem as good news, it is not. Once he finishes, he will have all he needs for his ritual."  Eri comes into the area from the southwest. Eri has arrived.  Though she tries to keep things understated and quiet, there is no mistaking this woman for anything other than a Sidhe. She stands tall, just a few inches shy of six feet, and manages to make her presence known without saying a word. It's easy to find fairer specimens of her Kith, but that innate quality all of them have still puts her beyond what most mortals can hope to attain. She has an athletic stance and looks to be in good shape. Hanging at her right side is a long, sturdy sword wrapped in a leather strap. The pommel is shaped like a falcon and enameled with the familiar green and gold.  Her hair is a startling color somewhere between bright gold and vivid red. She keeps it swept back into a sleek, heavy braid that ends between her shoulder blades. A few locks hang loosely and sweep her forehead and prominent cheekbones. A very thin, twisted gold circlet graces her brow, melding nicely with the color of her hair. Her eyes are a pale, leafy green flecked with gold and her skin is a darker shade of peach, the mark of someone who spends a lot of time outdoors. She has the typical upswept, angular features and sharply pointed ears of her Kith.  Her voile is all dark woody browns and forest greens. She wears a pair of trousers made from a thick, soft cotton dyed rich, ruddy brown and a plain, long-sleeved tunic in ivory. Over the tunic is a hard leather breastplate, carved with a swirling leafy pattern and fitted to her feminine shape. Pieces of light armor are strapped here and there, used as greaves over her boots, plates over her thighs, and shoulder guards. The armor is dark green and produces a gold sheen when it catches the light. It's hard to tell what it's made of at first glance, an unusual metal perhaps? Closer inspection reveals it to be some sort of chitinous material, like it was scavenged from an oversized insect. Over all is a soft green cloak. Anastasia is seated on the ground, her knees pulled to her chest and speaking softly with Pobble. She just finishes laying a few soft words down, before she goes quiet again, watching him with an introspective thoughtfulness.  Eri is looking at you.  "To summon the Devourer of Souls." Pobble finishes as he exhales with a haze of smoke. "He will need the soul of a magi to finish his work however.." He adds this almost uncomfortably, tapping the side of his cigarette suggesting a mild anxiety. He draws again, long and slow. "I tried looking into the waxworks, but it'll take a little more effort." The Blue Haired Yeti man is sat upon a log, staring at Anastasia quite intently as he speaks, oblivious to any folk along the path.  "Nyarlathotep, as I said to you in the library... why would he do this, though? To what purpose would one bring such darkness into our world?" Pobbly may be oblivious, but Ana sure as hell isn't - in fact, her head almost immediately turns in the direction of the footsteps. She puts a finger to her lips, and says in barely a whisper, "Ssh."  Eri walks back down the trail, her footsteps surprisingly light and causing little in the way of disturbance on the forest floor beneath. As she approaches, she glances up and blinks at the pair not too far off. Pobble is eyed again, and she peers at him for a moment before a quirky smile starts to spread across her face. She doesn't seem to have heard the whole conversation, though, and she clears her throat gently as she draws closer. "Hello," she murmurs, first to Anastasia, then turning her curious smile on the Yeti-man.  Pobble's head snaps around at the sound of another voice and while initially suprised simply at the occurance of an intrusion, sighting the woman his mouth opens just a little wider - smoke drifting out. He seems to be relaxed by something, but he peers across rudely, looking the newcommer up and down. "Eh, hello there." he states finally, letting out a low breath. It all seems to be getting a bit much for him and he places the cigarette between his lips, reaching into a pocket for something or other.  But when Eri approaches, so does Ana rise, and she lifts her dress a little, to dip into a curtsey, and speaks a polite, "My Lady," to Eri. "I hope my presence here with my companion is alright. We needed a place to speak privately, and noplace in town was suitable," she states, her voice soft and thoughtful, but making a point to explain the presence of a stranger so far out.  At Anastasia's style of greeting, Eri's eyes flash open wide in alarm and surprise, apparently not expecting it, and she double-takes at Pobble. Ah, a closer second look explains things. Her shoulders, covered by chitinous armor in her mien, droop in relief and she nods, smiling a little lopsidedly at Anastasia. "I see. Yes, of course," she murmurs, waving her hand. Then, giving a smile to Pobble, she bows her head to him, keeping her gaze fixed on him the entire time. "A pleasure." Straightening up, she says softly, "Well, I don't wish to interrupt your conversation. I should be getting back soon anyway."  It seems that Pobble doesn't really know what's going on. Ladies and curtseys are above him, but at the greeting from Eri he seems to think it fitting to offer some manner of half bow, as much as he's able from his seating poise on the log. "Indeed M'Lady." He sounds almost like Dick Dan Dyke adressing Mary Poppins. He stops rummaging in his pocket, thinking the better of things with new company and just taps his silvered nails together with a strange hard sound in the quiet night air. With nothing else to add right now he just looks between the two Ladies with a wonderous expression, trying to fit this all into some kind of sense.  Anastasia gestures to Pobble with a sweep of her hand. "The dark wizard who we have been hunting, m'lady. This man can help us," she states, directly, her voice bearing a strength and solidness of surety in this fact. She turns to Pobble and says, "Meet the Baroness, Lady Erianthe." Poor Pobble. His brain must be as fried as Ana's will be shortly. Ana swiftly faces the other woman and says, "This is Doctor Steve," and gives Pobble a nod.  "Doctor Steve," Eri echoes as she looks to the blue-haired man in the white coat, her words broken by an unintentional, good natured laugh. Then, more seriously, "Well, I'm glad to know we have more allies..." As her words drift off, she peers at Anastasia, hard, and then smirks faintly. "You've been working with the prodigals on this problem, haven't you? You're part of the group I've been passing notes to." She says this as a statement, not as a question, her tone amused. The wry set to her mouth makes it looks like she thinks she's been had.  A Baroness eh. Steve seems to think he should stand. Everyone else is doing it, so why not? This done, he's still at a loss, the conversation drifting over his head and his expression suggests that on some level he's jumping with a badly constructed net, trying to grab it and bludgeon some meaning from it. He flashes one of his more charming smiles when Eri addresses him, then pulls the last from his cigarette and brings up a foot to stub it on the sole of his boot. Right now, he has nothing to add so he just holds the cigarette butt behind his back with linked hands and stares at the women.  "M'Lady," she replies, her tones even-tempered and thoughtful, "Of course I could not pass up a stroke of good luck that fell in my path; I would hate to offend good Fortuna," and she looks up towards the sky and smiles toward it, giving the goddess a nod. She comes back to the here and now, and then blinks, looking between them suspiciously, her eyeballs ping-pong back and forth, pursing her lips puzzledly.  Eri's mouth still has that wry twist to it as she eyes Anastasia. Looking back to Pobble, she peers a little at him, as though weighing his character. "Well, my lady, you probably know more about this than I do. And what irony, that I get the blame for the waxworks still standing, and not telling your good Baron all I know, when there is one in his house who is far closer to the problem than I." Her eyes twinkle at Ana, then, and she smirks. "No fear. Your secret is safe with me."  She frowns somewhat at all of that, and states directly, earnestly, and with a bit of heaviness in her tone, "M'Lady, there is nothing that you know that the good Baron does not know, and did not know first... save for my association with the good doctor, here. I am looking at the ultimate goal, and politics and personal grudges bedevilled - It is far more important that this wizard be kept from completing his ritual than are our fragile and ephemeral egos." Damn, Ana. Your tone has gone almost completeley to scolding, though it's a general scold on all of the silly fae. "Doctor," she now says, facing the man, "Do you know of the spheres? And of how his victims die?"  Pobble remains in place for a while, but decides to settle back down on the log. He brings his hands around to the front, now free of the filter and probably hoping that no one noticed its discardation. He doesn't seem to bothered by the inspection he's recieving as he shouldn't since he's doing plenty of inspecting himself. Indeed, due to inspecting he doesn't even realize he's been spoken to for a short while. Sound catches up with thinking and he starts, looking to Ana with a sheepish little smile that fades as the meat of the question is realized. "His victims do not die. They are brutalized by the waxworks and then absorbed.. I'm guessing that he uses the statues for storage of their souls. Which is of course, what the whole beef is. Six hundred and sixty six souls." A slow nod follows, all smiles gone far away.  Pobble's remarks don't seem cause a reaction in Eri, other than a mute, grim nod. "Yes, it's what I've been saying to everyone all along. I mentioned this just the other day, Lady Ana," she murmurs. Something in her is dark, disquieted and she grits her teeth, gaze dropping to someplace in the distance.  "Not the statues," corrects Anastasia, "I witnessed firsthand the couple murdered at the park, Doctor, as they died," and then stops herself, "Well, not firsthand, but through my arts, but it really is all the same,' she states. This part, she starts to say faster, her voice getting excited, in quite the same way that Velma from Scooby Doo does when she figures out who the man in the boogyman costume really is. She rushes, quicker and quicker, until she's almost tripping over her words, "The wax figures melted out of the sky above them! They did! Just came out of the sky! And... and they ... they held these small spheres to their victims! Little black marbles, so they seemed! And.. and the souls were just drawn up into those things. The creatures melted back into the sky, and the victims bled to death, just HANGING there... dead... on crosses... oh my god, I can almost see them now..." She squeezes them shut, as if to block the images away, and she shivers.  Pobble peers at Anastasia, perhaps not linking earlier events with current agitation. "Once he has a magi soul to finish the collection, some Very Bad Shit will happen." This is most definately the Trademarked variety of Very Bad Shit. At least he's stopped staring and is now introvertedly considering the situation. "We have a few ideas, but need to investigate the waxworks further. One of my colleagues has been inside the statues.. it ain't so pleasant." Silver nails tap together with a metallic sound. "Supposedly the Devourer of Souls, or Nylarathotep.. will erase all the light of creation." Another slow nod, "Maybe the statue of The Black Pharoah is related to the ritual in some Lovecraftian throwback way."  While that simmering, brooding anger was broiling just under the surface in Eri before, the description of the deaths of those people gets her to stop, softening her anger just a little bit. Her gaze flickers as the details wash over her. Then quietly, she whispers harshly, "No. More. Investigating. This place goes down in the next forty-eight hours. If someone else prefers to do it, I will let them, but I will take a torch to the place myself if I have to. Mr. Shobaz has already taken the liberty of informing me that his ritual is complete. He requires the last piece, and I aim to see to it that he does not have that opportunity."  The younger sidhe draws slowly out of her little scary place, and eyes Pobble, "Yes... so I too, have known one, a fae, too, who has been into the other realms through his keep." Ana starts to bite her lip, then she smiles all too broadly, which is likely not appropriate at all for the heaviness of this conversation. She's still kind of stammery, though. "The pharoah is the obvious answer, is it not? And being that he seems to me to be one completely pretentious asshole, he'd likely use it, too. Fucking spook." Her voice getting faster, more uneven in its speaking, halting occasionally, as Ana peers up towards the trees for the words, "I told the Baron that.. They are not ready to act, though. They do not believe the threat is that close. Fools."  "I think.." says Pobble slowly, pulling from his pocket another cigarette. This one however is crooked and wrapped in blue paper. "That burning down the house will do no good at this stage. He's not stupid enough to leave his work in such a visible place..Maybe." He falters, looking across at Ana and a peice falling into place. He smiles lopsidedly despite the seriousness of the situation, looking sheepish as he sparks up his bluestick. There is a pungent aroma as he continues, "I don't think it'd be that easy. He'll be no pushover." Words are spoken distractedly as he studies Anastasia. "I have a.." Again he pauses, looking almost shy for the briefest moment, "Friend who was studying his craft there.. Maybe she'd have an idea of the rest of his place. After all, it could be that his ritual is there, but also somewhere else. Or maybe no place at all."  "Put that away," Eri says flatly, deadpan to Pobble, pretending not to look directly at the blunt, but straight ahead. "And he's working on some sort of... thing... under tarps in the lobby of his museum. And I've heard mention of objects that are tied into this, but I haven't found out any more than that about them. I'll find the contact there." Any more she's going to say is cut off by Anastasia's strange behavior. "Are you okay?"  Anastasia has suddenly become quiet interested in her cloak. She holds it in her hands, and is running her fingers along the stars, poking at them, and saying softly, "Rigil. Siruis. Betelgeuse..." Her other hand is rubbing the fabric in slow circles, seeming to just delight in the touch. She looks up slowly, and her heavy eyes with the quite large pupils stare blankly for a moment, and then she closes them, nodding towards Pobble, "You are most correct, there, too. I say, for starters, we create as much havoc around the museum as possible. Police. Fire department. Water mains breaking. An elephant loose from the zoo and shifted through the spacetime contiuum to that exact, /PRECISE!/ point, right above an unsuspecting tourist, on whom it will fart, and terrify to a near comatose stupor. And then... THEN, my friends," she sweeps, riding on some sudden inspiration, "Then, we go after the statue, his balls, and the whole Sha-boz!" She's practically whooping. Damn, she does love it when she gets a good idea. She bobs her head at Eri, "Oh yes. I'm doing /great/."  Pobble looks sidelong at Eri as he pulls on his blue stick. It seems to be needed, hands were on the verge of shaking. Still, some people don't like it. Those same people walk around in insect armour in the woods. It's all reasonable, right? He stubs the thing for now, carefully and sets it down besides him, looking disgruntled. The mood doesn't last as he's taking up in the amusement of Anastasia's rant. "Eh, yes. There are plenty of options." he agrees, "Whatever is done, will be difficult. I have no idea what he's capable of, but would guess at it being 'A Lot'.  Eri catches the look from Pobble and fixes her attention on him. Her mood is already dark regarding other things, so that gets unintentionally shifted to him for the moment. "As far as my job in the forest goes, I'm still a cop. If someone walks by, they're going to see a Park Ranger standing here doing nothing while people break laws around me. Just don't do it where I can see, okay? And don't burn the place down either." She says the last not as though she'd believe he'd do that, just sort of darkly humorous. Looking back to the raving Anastasia, she peers at her, hard, then pulls back. "I think I'm going to go have a chat with a certain someone about other business. Would you care to be there, or would you like to come along?"  Anastasia gasps out, and her eyes widen and she freezes in panic. "Oh... ohmigod, no... no, please no, M'lady, good Lady, good Baroness, please don't get me in trouble with the Baron for telling you these things..." SHe looks completely terrified at the thought, and hurriedly, she grabs Pobble's arm and yanks on it. "Do something. /Please!/" As if anyone with any rational sense in their heads would know that htere is little that Pobble could reasonably do.  All that Pobble can say is, "You're a cop?" incredulously while looking at Eri. "I guess Park Rangers really get some whacky gear in case of emergency.." After a whistle, he peers back at Anastasia and pats her hand supportively. The fact that he's clueless isn't lost on him. Still, he puts on a better smile and beams it at Eri. "What she said? Please?" he asks, feeling somehow honour bound to try and do something or other.  Eri frowns at Anastasia, half in confusion, half still upset about other things. "I've been betrayed by your Baron, Lady Ana. Completely and utterly. I intended to remedy this situation. If you like, I'll tell him I forced the information out of you. Let him take his anger out on me for that." To Pobble, she says tiredly, her voice low, "Look harder at me."  Nothing in particular stands out about this woman. She could be considered either completely ordinary or somewhat pretty, according to one's tastes. Her skin is peach-hued and freckled, a feature highlighted by constant exposure to the sun. She doesn't seem to find a need for makeup, but she looks decent enough without it. A crease or two on the outside corners of her eyes marks her as being a bit beyond her mid-twenties, possibly in her early thirties. She has hazel eyes and mousy brown hair. The hair is kept back in a braid that ends between the shoulderblades. She has prominent, upswept cheekbones and a slightly pointed chin, giving her an angular look.  Her height is more impressive than her looks. She stands just a few inches short of six feet, emphasizing her lean shape. Though light, she has an athletic stance and very little bodyfat. Her arms and legs are well-toned and look as though they are used to being put to work. Her nails are kept clean, clipped short, and unpolished.  Right now, she's dressed in the uniform of a Washington State Parks Ranger; a khaki button-down shirt tucked into olive green denim jeans. Over the shirt is an olive green quilted jacket, good for keeping the rain off, with a brass nameplate over the left breast pocket and official-looking patches on each shoulder. Her only adornment is a thin gold chain that hangs inside her shirt, held down by a hidden weight. The jeans are held up by a wide black leather belt that also holds a utility knife, several other small black leather cases, and a walkie-talkie. On her feet is a pair of old black hiking boots.  'Ohs' silently after staring his hardest at Eri. This does seem to take a bit of getting used to. He alternatives between glancing and staring for a few moments, enamoured by the novelty of double vision.  Don't back someone like Ana into a corner, not with a head that's a little twisted right now. She shakes her head tightly, and now says once again, clasping her hands hard to the point that her knuckles turn white. "Baroness. No. Please... think of the priorities... we have two days..." Her descent begins. "Please no. Any way you got this knowledge, you did not get it from me! You... you..." And further she descends, from fear to paranoia - the metaphorical fur starting to raise. She flings her hands at her sides, and now The Rage (tm) is starting to well up, though it's got a wyld chaotic fling about it, like a live wire dancing on wet pavement. "I give you truth and you stab me in the back! And they call Eiluneds treacherous!" Suddenly, she looks at her hands she just flung and becomes /intensely/ interested in them, The Rage (tm) subsiding almost as quickly as it came. She drops her jaw a little and waves her hand in front of her face, then two and fro in front of her eyes. This most delighted little smile comes over her lips.   Eri looks between Pobble and Anastasia, her expression worried now. "Um, Doctor, would you mind very much if I took the young lady home now? She looks like she needs to rest. And I hope next time we meet under better circumstances..." she sighs. Her hand reaches for Anastasia's upper arm, but gently.  Pobble moves to stand, looking uncomfortable and surreptitously slips something from a pocket into Anastasia's hand. He gives her a 'shh' look after glancing at Eri and straightens out his coat. "Well, eh.. It was fabulous meeting you both. Again but different." He stands sheepish, clapping his gloved hands together and smiling like the boy who's been caught doing something terribly bad but is unashamed. He nods to Eri's request. "I think that may be wise.."  Anastasia points to Pobble, "But what about him, wandering around, enchanted like that...?" She looks to Eri, a little hopefully. "Pobble, come find me again. I'll be right here." She taps the ground with her foot, and nods to Eri. "Don't get me in trouble... or I'll be very upset." There's a dark tone just beneath the surface on those last two words.

      A note is left in the loft, it's scrawled in a spidery hand recognizable as Pobble's.    Today I met with some strange people and noticed the existance of a before unnoticed duality. Some bizarre creatures that call themselves Fae and seem to be normal but then unexpectedly are other people while still being themselves. I am unsure what to make of it, but they seem to exist in some manner of feudal society.  Anyhow. While their leader, the Baron seems unwilling to act, certain of their apparent nobility are keen to put an end to Cornelius's plans. Supposedly they have been informed that his ritual to summon Nylarathotep (The Devourer of Souls) is complete but for the taking of the last Awakened soul. Once this is done, the demon shall rise from the deep umbra and consume all light in creation. Supposedly. They plan to do some ass kicking and put an end to this. Some of them seem kitted out with all manner of strangeness, like swords and shit. I don't know. If shit goes down, maybe we should support them? One is called Anastasia. She's a violin teacher. They all hang out at the Brewery. Look them up.  Me, I need to go back to London for a little while. My grandma died.  Love an kisses.  Pobso.   [OOC: My parents are comming to stay for a week or so and will be living in the computer room hence I won't be around much. Email me if you need anything.]

      Mead Forest - Alti Lake          Verdant green gives way to brilliant skies of blue marked by the occasional puffy cloud that slowly floats across  the sea above. The forest has parted and the tall elms and oaks give way to smaller ash and the occasional shrub, the difference in height lending an appearance of homage paid. The creation to which such fealty and respect is paid is a simple lake that stretches off into the distance, but whose furtherest banks can still be glimpsed at the limits of one's sight.          The banks are marked by patches of nine o' tails and reeds that interrupt the lines of smooth earth worn so by  water and time. The croak of a frog and the cry of the birds above intermingle with the rough sounds of ducks and the buzzing of insects. Every so often, one catches sight of a shadow, small and undefined, sliding beneath the surface further from shore as well as the occasional glimpse of glittering silver scales. A sense of peace marks the scene, one that almost seems to make one desire to move on than stay and risk disturbing the tranquility of the lake's inhabitants.  Contents: Liv Polar-bear Jodie Kaze Matt Zoe Kasui Sylvan Obvious exits: North    Southwest    Polar-bear is looking at you.  Sylvan returns to Jodie's side, then ushers her and Kasui to follow her back home. She calls to Matt and the other, "I hope we meet again and share a good meal and stories."  Pobble trundles along, with a monkey sat on his shoulder. He seems mostly held up by his walking stick which isn't of the bought variety but of the 'picked up along the way to prevent falling over' kind. His expression is paradoxial, a conflict of hyperactivity and tiredness as if desparately wanting to lie down and sleep but being pulled along on some travel against his will.  Sylvan departs the well-worn paths of the lake area, disappearing into the thickets and brambles.  Sylvan has left.  Moving along an overgrown path, the Polar-bear ambles along at an easy gait. On his back, rides the lovely Liv. She grins widely, her fingers digging deeply down into the bear's thick fur and holding herself on.  Zoe nods to Sylvan as she leaves with the others, then turns when she hears the others, her face taking on an air of  disbelief. Do they never stop arriving to private property?? Yet, when the bear is spied, she smiles a touch, a hand  reaching out to touch Matt briefly to call attention, the dog at her feet growling before she gives another silent hand  command that hushes the beagle.  Jodie does proceed to follow Sylvan, giving her farewells to the others with a wave and a smile before turning to go  through the same opening in the brush Syl went through.  Matt quirks a brow, seeing the Polar bear and his rider. He looks at them curiously.  Polar-bear looks around at all the folks comming and going and staying. He wanders over to bump into Zoe. Not hard. Maybe a sort of polar bear version of 'Hey how are you?'. Then he stop. Hm. Pobble has his attention as the beast decides how he feels around one of these two legged things wearing so much white fur. And the monkey. It's ... bite sized. Yum.  Liv is looking at you.  Kasui pushes away from the tree as Sylvan urges her, apparently not having been so unalert after all. She says not a word as she follows Sylvan through the opening in the brush, merely giving Zoe and Matt a nod, thugh sh gives th epolar bear a sidelong glance before disappearing after her friend into the rushes...  Liv is just along for the ride. Her eyes get wide as she bear bumps into people.. and she ofers an appologetic smile as she says "Hi.. uhm.. excuse us..." THe woman speak with a noticable norse sort of accent.  Zoe cannot help but smile at the bear, though she glances to Matt first before hse reaches out to give the huge animal a friendly scritch. Yeah, she's petting a polar bear. STrange things you see sometimes here in the woods. Lifting her gaze to the woman that rides the bear, she smiles, nodding to her, "Good afternoon.. It is ok." At least she's not been licked yet by fish-baited drooly tongue. Turning, she leans in to whisper something to Matt at her side.  Pobble stops dead in his tracks. He sways uncertainly, struggling against gravity. Eyes dart between those assembled, and the bear. The monkey seems edgy, tiny hands grabbing onto one of Pobble's braids and it lets out a quiet chitter. The blue haired yeti nods slowly. "Eh. Sorry. I'm lost.. I was trying to get back to the picnic site?" His coat is pulled and torn, as are his pants. Leaves and bambles cling to the thick white fur. He does look in the 'lost and distraught' category.  Kaze is for his part still standing in the shadows at the edge of the treeline, seeming to slide easily from the mind's eye as he merely watches making no moves to call attention to himself.  Matt nods softly to something Zoe says to him.  Monkey ... so tastey ... The bear licks his lips and stares.  Liv notices where the bear is looking, and reaches out to bonk the white monster square between his ears with a fist!   "There'll be no eating of pets." she states firmly.  Kasui has disconnected.  The Monkey also seems to notice the attention it's getting and slinks down into it's clothing before clambering behind   Pobble's head and dropping down into the oversized hood. The blue haired man hops from one foot to the other, apparently cold. Eyes with oversized pupils dart from one wood-lover to the next. "Anyone able to direct me?"  Matt hmms. "I'm sorry, what're you looking for?'  Zoe muffles a laugh at Liv's words to the bear, then falls silent as she turns to look at Pobble, curious and watchful of  the strange one with the monkey on his back. Oiy, that just makes her want to start singing for some reason.  Could just gobble him right up. Or maybe just half. Save the rest for ... Hey! THe bear crains his neck to see the woman on his back. He does his best to look wounded. Deeply. On a moraly and philosophical level. Then he bolts for the water, taking his passanger with him.  Kaze steps out from where he has been the entire time, only now coming into general notice stepping over near Pobble and eyeing the bear with rider, "It is this way Pobble-san, come I will show you." Where did he come from anyway? He motions with one hand for Pobble to follow heading towards one of the paths.  Giving a startled cry, Liv is forced to hold on.. or be dumped in the dirt. She gives a cry of exclamation as she starts to  tug on ythe bear's shoulders saying "No! No! Not the water!"  Pobble is momentarily distracted by the ridden bear and looses track of his reply. Mouth flapping he finally finds some  words, sounding weary and a little agitated. "Picnic grounds? I parked somewhere near a picnic ground and have been wandering all night. I'm fuckin' tired now. I want to go home." The arrival of Kaze throws him further off guard and he gawps at the man as if to say 'What are you doing here?' Either way, he begins to walk towards him and his direction.  Yes, the water. The ground practicly shakes as the bear eats up the distance and ... SPLASH! He comes to the surface looking quite pleased with himself.  Falling off the bears back, Liv is soaked easily to the bone. Sputtering and spitting out water, she comes up to the  surface and splashes at the big white bear.  Matt chuckles a bit. "Water, it's wet."  Swimming to shore, Liv shakes herself off the best she can, and then moves towards the trails and back into the woods...   Seems she doesn't want to stick around all wet.  Pobble peers at the hoohaffle and shakes his head lightly, forcing himself to move onwards with the aid of his big stick.   The monkey still cowers mostly out of sight in the hood and he comes to a halt next to Kaze, leaning across to whisper. "Please.. get me out of here." He seems quite anxious at the situation unfolding about him.  Zoe watches as Pobble seems to go off with.. wait, where did Kaze come from? Talk about people coming out of the woodwork today! Blinking a few times, she turns back in time to see the bear hit the water, and Liv swim to shore and disappear. Giggling finally, she hides the smile, turning to look at Matt for a moment, brow raised in silent question to him before turning back.  Polar-bear lumbers out of the water and shakes off, creating a brief rain storm. You can almost see him laughing. That is under the sandwhich, er monkey catches his eye again.  Matt nods to Zoe, and moves to greet teh bear and his companion. "Heya. I'm Matt - Zoe says you're a friend of hers."  Kaze nods to Pobble and leads him up the path to the North and away.  Kaze makes his way north.  Kaze has left.  You make your way north.

      Downtown - New Town District(#433RJs) -= Erin and Pike =-          Hip dance clubs and upper scale restaurants line the streets of New Town, everything from the newest teenage fad to old style swing dancing being seen easily on these streets. The young to middle aged crowd seems to frequent this area, a culturally diverse area with everything from the preppy high school jock to the pierced stoner hang out on the strip to find the new coolest spot to go on the weekends. The billboards seem to have taken notice of the party society in the area as well, various ads for entertainment places and items showing up more frequently than in other sections of the city.         To the side of the area a rather pleasant mini-park has formed, a statue of Zeus standing proud. At various times during the day and night, automated sprinklers go off to make sure that every plant receives the nourishment it requires for perfect blooming. Speckles of colors ranging from a deep violet to a cottony soft baby blue line the edge of the statue for a quaint place to stop and indeed, smell the flowers.  Contents: Artus Lily Obvious exits: The Pulse    North on Pike    South on Pike S  West on Erin    East on Erin    Artus shrugs resignedly. "I try the occasional sketch in the privacy of my own home, but I typically become distracted by shadows cast by leaves, or water splashing over a stone, and lose my interest in the endeavour." He turns a corner onto Pike Street. "Creativity is my forte only so far as my appreciation of its rigors, products, methods." He smiles, perhaps a bit roguishly (though at what is slightly uncertain), and says, "Thank you, though." Lily trails along at Artus' side, playing with a silver lighter. Up, catch. Up, catch. She'll drop it if she isn't careful, set her fool self afire. Her reply to the gentleman at her side is quiet, very quiet indeed, but the afternoon crowd is thin enough that perhaps it carries. "You are quite welcome. And I would be interested to see some of these sketches, if you keep them."  A rare clear afternoon breeds foot traffic through the downtown area, even on disastrous days such as this. Drawn to this area of commerce, out of hunger or fiduciary necessities, is a healthy smattering of homeless. Hoping to reap the rewards of a generous public on this fine day. The blue skies encourage the spirit of charity.   So it's easy to lose Cash here, easy to mistake him as another beggar. Or drunk. Well drunk he might be, but his wandering sneakers carry the hallmark of a traveling handyman rather than a sedentary bum. In his hand a half empty bottle, his march eastwards an absent shuffle. Moving away from the setting sun and headlong into darkness.  Perhaps by the very virtue of his aura of abandonment, the woebegone, tattered vagabond attracts the attention of Artus Cimber. "Perhaps I spoke in haste," he tells Lily, though exactly which conversational tidbit he's referring to is unclear. He stops suddenly, having just passed a public mailbox, and opens the drop slot as though to make certain his mail was properly deposited. Reaching in as though to dislodge a stubborn envelope, he passes a few idle remarks, then, satisfied at last, withdraws his hand. Keen observers would note he now holds something, when previously he carried nothing. Gently, he alters Lily's course so as to intercept the wandering man with the run-down shoes.  Lily envinces no surprise at her partner's behavior, receptive to the new course and instantly scanning the afternoon crowds for the likely reason. Up, catch. Up, catch. The silver lighter flashes one last time before she slips it into a pocket, clasping her hands behind her back in the timeless manner of the absent-minded academic sort. "It does not due to be too hasty, I suppose," she murmurs absently, still searching the sidewalk. Cash? Possibly. Her brows lift in mild curiosity as she wagers he's the reason. "One can do a good dead now and then, if one is careful not to boast. The gods hate overweening pride."  The soles, just as worn as the man who wears them. Chin slightly angled upwards, as to point his dull brown gaze towards the neon signs that are just starting to come alive in the time before dusk. A few small rivers of alcohol clinging to his chin, sending a hundred proof droplet towards the thirsty cement every ten steps. Cash. Absent and wandering. It's a wonder he didn't stumble directly into the fire hydrant he just passed. Or the waitress moving with intention towards her second shift. His fingers, a loose spider grasp upon the neck of his glass feeder. He says something about 'socks' and how they never come back in pairs. But who pays heed to the ramblings of street folk.  Artus manipulates the object in his hand with deft rapidity; the motion looks somewhat like a shuffling of cards. Finished in a trice, he keeps it hidden against the palm and underside of his arm. Having crossed the street, he regains the sidewalk and approaches Cash from behind on loud, obvious footsteps. He calls out in a voice obviously British: "Pardon me, my good man."  Lily rolls her eyes Heavenward, murmuring something in a foreign tongue and shaking her head in a long-suffering manner, but she follows Artus, several careful paces behind. Despite her initial response, there is something keenly wary about the way she approaches, ready for anything; her hands are no longer clasped behind her back, but held loosely at her sides. "He is harmless," she offers reassuringly to Cash. Her own accent is from a good bit East of the UK, calling to mind a Bela Lugosi impression. "Best merely to humor him." Overhead, the sky starts to darken to amber as the sun begins its westward descent. Soon it will be full night.  Still locked in his internal debate on foot ware, Cash doesn't stop immediately. Instead, his pace slowly grinds to a halt as the realization sets in, he's being addressed. And not by his inner voice. He turns to peer over a shoulder, just above the upturned collar of his jacket. Normally, that'd be a nice ward against the harsh chill of this city. Today though, its function is purely aesthetic.   Eyes are suspicious and squint at the albino tracking him down. Cash's grip upon the bottle tightens. Protect the assets first. "Uhhh... hey… man." That's the best he can manage. Count Lily; he keeps in the corner of his watch, brushing aside some of his hair that obscures a blurry gaze. He focuses and defocuses, the way drunk men do.   Artus, to his enormous satisfaction, is not telepathic, nor is he an albino, and thus a point of possible contention is done away with before it even becomes an issue. His smile is mild and genuine, his face is expressive and seems to change often, as whim or weather dictate. "I'm frightfully sorry to disturb your meditation on this brisk afternoon, but certain circumstances compell me to intrude when otherwise I would simply acknowledge your presence with a nod and continue on my way in deference to your obvious high station among devotees of the Tao." He turns up his palm, displaying a brown leather wallet--hardly a thing to carry every adjunct required by a gentleman, but certainly sufficient for simple excusions given the efficiency of modern currencies. "To whit: you dropped this during your shuffling."  "Indeed, you did," Lily murmurs. Her expression is less open than that of her companion, but her lips curve in an implied smile, though it may be directed as much at Artus' back as at Cash. "Terribly clumsy of you, sir. You should be more careful. There are footpads about."  The random threads of fate that brought these three together carry with them a certain deliberate nature. A predestined set of laws that seem to hover above Cash, pressing and trumping the natural order of things. To those who can sense such aberrations, there is something not all together Kosher about this bum, despite the Star of David hanging upon his neck. A curse, a charm, a blessing from a one eyed Gypsy. Or a charge account the size of the eastern seaboard ran up upon Miss Cleo's line.   Chapped lips hesitate a response, and his brow rises in a Vulcan like fashion to regard the offering. "Wha'... I 'aven't carried a wallet for four years... man. Whaz' tha' catch." Cash leans back to drench his innards with a gulp of whiskey.  Artus considers the situation with nonchalance, as if never had it occurred to him there might be some difficulty. "To a true student of the Tao, a year is as a day." He puts on an expression as of one ransacking his memory banks for the necessary information. "I disctinctly recall saying nothing to the effect that it happened just now. And, as you will notice--" he says, flipping open the wallet "--there is no proof of ownership available to refute me, though I confess in my haste to return this property, it may have departed for parts unknown. Still, it would seem to be an aspect to the situation with little weight for consideration." He indicates the wallet. "Here is the wallet." He opens the billfold. "Here is the money contained in the wallet." He indicates the crowd of afternoon shoppers. "Here is the crowd, manifestly deigning no search for its missing property." He straightens. "Therefore, I now tender you the wallet and all its contents, free of charge, wholly and forever, in full and in total, with neither disclaimer, nor yet corollary expectation." He proffers the item in question to Cash.  "It also may be that the Tao has less to do with it than does Marx," Lily opines mildly. "Perhaps my friend merely wishes to reapportion the capital reasources currently within this wallet, so that it no longer lines the pockets of those content to profit from the exploitation of others but rather rewards Labor, isolated from the work of his hands and bleeding, ever bleeding, to oil the wheels of capitolist hegemony. Or," she adds, "Maybe he is a crazy person."  The barrage of words find their home in an accepting recipient. Cash takes them all, in full, and without protest. The wallet, however, is still viewed with suspicion. Words are free, even fancy ones. And as Artus and Lily assault him with the Queen's English, there is no lack of understanding. But the manner with which he is approached is suspect even in it's self. Never mind the wallet that's most likely filled with a deadly nerve agent. It seems obviously a ploy of some sort. But living out here, one gets used to three card Monty. Cash thinks himself smarter than the average shell game. So he takes it. Opens it. And inspects for Anthrax.   "Yer both like... fucking nutz… man." He comes to that conclusion in a roundabout way, without sugar coating. Still holding the magic bullet, Cash looks back up between the generous duo. Waiting for them to pull badges. Or to pull their faces off and reveal the alien circuitry beneath. And suddenly, he finds this situation funny, as his smirking lips betray.  Artus brightens. "Your imputations mock us, sir!" he says, laughing to show he comprehends the joke. He looks as though he might pat Cash on the shoulder, but restrains his boisterous demeanor... either by reason of decoum or the aforementioned infectious diseases. The contents of the wallet are very crisp and very green and boast very large numbers. "After four years of emptiness, it must be gratifying to once again hold the wallet which has so long served you." With a sigh of contentment, he steps back, mission accomplished and perfectly executed. "And please take no offense if you notice the contents to be organized in a fashion at odds with those in which you left them. So long away from its owner has made this wallet a little eccentric and I may have slipped in a reimbursement or two where I noticed a lack." He tips an imaginary hat. "And we are not /both/ fucking nuts," Lily adds in her precise manner. "I can tell a hawk from a handsaw." With that, she turns and begins walking along the former course she shared with Artus, fishing the lighter from her pocket again. Up, catch. Up, catch. Hand to hand, back and forth. Maybe she's teaching herself to juggle. "Coming, Karl?"  Well, the spirit of generosity is alive and well in Erin's Vale. This is good for those who live off the kindness of strangers. Someone call Blanche. Cash, convinced the moment of entrapment has faded, slides the wallet home into the back pocket of his greasy jeans. The denim scarecrow turns slightly to watch the woman juggle away. Perhaps being called 'nutz' by an untouchable is amusing, and surely it was meant almost as a compliment. One which fingers the odd couple out of a sea of hegemony.   And back to Artus as he's not completely out of view yet. Cash returns the nod. His smile says 'I see you, seeing me'. "La Chiam." A Jewish toast, the bottle is tipped in his direction. The encounter over, his shuffle restarts. Something new to ponder.  Artus reaches up to adjust the set of the shirt on his shoulders, then puts both hands in the pockets of his pants. He falls back into step with Lily, sweeping to one side of the disaffected vagrant... or Taoist master. It's all a matter of perspective. "Take care, sir," he calls over his shoulder. "It was a pleasure meeting you after all these years of searching." As he passes a trashcan, he throws something in, then continues on his way, seemingly in the highest of spirits.

      You pull open one of the glass doors and step inside Papa's Chicken Shack. Slums - Papa's Chicken Shack(#1559RJs)          Papa's is a little different from most fast food joints as one can tell when they step through the doors. From it's employees dressed comfortably in jeans and tshirts, to the checkered plastic cloths that cover the tables in the dining area, it speaks of a family run business - the big guy in back even answers to 'Papa'. Above the counter with it's single register lies a menu board - if it can be fried, it's probably up there. Dine-in or carry-out, either way, the extra grease on the side is free!  Contents: Rusty Thomas Obvious exits: Out (O) Rusty shakes his head slowly at Thomas, and starts talking quickly between bouts of animalistic mastication, "I sleep in the woods mostly. There was this other kid who slept in a garbage bin but that's stupid. People can find you." He has a good ten - okay now six piece of chicken in front of him. Thomas doesn't seem to be eating. He sucks his fingers clean of grease, though the layer of dirt and god knows what else remains. "Plus people are scared of me."  The old man shuffles in from the street, the early spring stink of the trash thawing out in the surrounding slum wafting in with him. Digging in to his coats pockets he prodcues a collection of crumpled singles and a handful of change, obviously from a productive afternoon, and dumps it out on the counter. Tonights dinner in the planning.  Thomas seems to ponders this. Garbage bin. "Rai.", he guesses. For some reason another name pops up too, but he knows for a fact that this kid is no longer sleeping there. "But yes, of course they are.", he says, once more smiling lightly at the kid sitting in front of him, trying to choke himself on chickens. And fries. And ketchup. And ....  Rusty dumps a mound of relish in his mouth and then follows with some chicken torn off from the drumstick. He mixes it around in his mouth. He turns his head to look to Compton for a moment, but in the grand scheme of things what does some care kid about some old guy. Except to comment that he smells better than the old guy. "Man, that guy smells worse than me." Unlikely. He looks to Thomas. "So.. are you a knight or something?"  Chik'n biscuits. Combo #3 appears after Compton counts out the dollars and cents and pockets his savings. The plastic tray and paper cup of Coke and his sorry carcass settle down in to a both by the front door and tucks in.  Thomas turns to look at the man Rusty seems to indicate, before he raises an eyebrow. "I think you are about equal.", he comments, sniffling slightly, before actually scoffing at the next question. "A knight? No, certainly not.", he states in his habitual quiet voice, shaking his head. "I am just myself.", he clarifies. As the older man settles, Thomas attention seems to settle as well, back completely on the kid sittion opposite of him.  Rusty goes through eight pieces of chicken at a frightening rate and he's talking quickly. "Okay. Where did you come from?" He pauses as he's talking and then chokes on something, it could be a lot of things, in his throat. He turns and heaves, his beady eyes bulging and watering and forming a red ring. You're pretty sure something comes up because suddenly his cheeks bulge and some liquid escapes his tightly pressed lips. He blinks and then gulps back hard. Then he chokes a bit more, coughing into the floor and slipping off his seat. (OOC) Rusty says, "hehehe I hope nobody's having dinner right now" (OOC) Thomas warns he has to retreat to bed soonish. (OOC) Rusty says, "okie" (OOC) Rusty says, "Compton's next right?"  (OOC) Compton is good. (OOC) Thomas says, ".nods ;)" WEATHER REPORT: The clouds overhead begin to lower, blanketing the land in fog. Thomas seems to take a moment to consider the question, but instead is ultimately interupted as the poor kid almost barfs up all the food again. "Been eating too fast, have you?", he asks, quite simply, looking, watching the poor kid struggle with containing the contents of his stomach. Well, if he throws up, he throws up. If not, then not. "How long ago since you ate anything proper, hmm?", he wonders. No, it is not the food, nor an alien trying to break free of his chest. Calm down again. Rusty sniffs and blinks some of the water from his eyes, seeming to have gotten ahold of himself. He gulps a couple times. Climbs back onto his chair. "I.." he reaches to take a gulp of rootbeer. "I just drank my own puke." He hehehs. Then he pales. "I don't feel so good. Can I get it to go?"  Thomas nods his head. "I am sure they will pack it for you, if you ask nicely.", he says, nodding in the direction of the counter. And should Rusty indeed go to let his food be packed up, Thomas would get up, cross the floor, 'loose' a five-dollar note near the table of the older man sitting there, before slipping out, leaving the kid to return to an empty table. He would know where to find him if he really wished to, now. No need to press the charitability too far, is there?  (OOC) Thomas thankies for the RP but I am nearing keyboard face.  (OOC) Rusty says, "hehe.. thanks. Later!" Thomas goes home. Thomas has left.  Compton peers at the fiver like a scorpion on the shitter. Looking around quickly for the sting, he extends a Birkenstocked foot and drags the moolah back and under his table. Careless people. Rusty walks back to the table, pausing to let out a long belch. He furrows his brow when he sees the table's empty and gives a snort. He ambles over to Compton and kicks the back of the old guy's chair leg to get his attention. "Hey. You see where the guy I was talking to went?"  Compton puts a protective arm around his grub, and hunkers down, eyeing the street urchent warily. Over a gobfull of buscuit he manages, "Out tha door." he manages with a gravelly voice.  Rusty glowers at the door. "Oh." He squints his beady eyes at Compton and kicks his chair again. "Hey, what's your problem?"  "'m fuckin eatin." he barks, spittle and chunks of bread hit the table as if to make the point valid.   Compton did seem to be enjoying it too, taking his time. Not like some starving people... "Wot's yers?"  Rusty furrows his brow, a little taken aback. "-You- looking at me like that. Fuck. I jus' asked a fucking question.." He pauses in his muttering and glances quickly at the unhappy kitchen staff. "Quiet down, dummy."  "Settle down son." he says in a tired way, plucking another tuft of buscuit from the basket. "Yer friend dropped this.." and the $5 is dragged back out from under the table for you to see.  -------------------------[ Info Report for Rusty ]--------------------------  GENERAL INFO:         That ratty kid you see wandering the park every now and again that probably has no home. What do you know about him? Well, mostly, that he smells bad and likes to growl at inanimate objects. -----------------------------------[ - ]------------------------------------ Overhead, the sky starts to darken to amber as the sun begins its westward descent. Soon it will be full night. Rusty stoops and grabs the bill. He stuffs it in his pocket, grinning, "Thanks." He sucks on his rootbeer till it makes a gurgling sound and then discards the empty cup on the table in front of Compton. "Who're you?"  Compton chews and chews, watching you thoughtfully. Weighing the options here. Give up a name, his name... "Cash" he says eventually, offering up a calloused bony hand. Rusty furrows his brow. "Your name's Cash? Like Jonny Cash?"  "Yeah. Like Jonny Cash. Parents were fans." his tone getting a slight edge to it, like he's used to having this coversation over and over again.  "You gotta name?" COmpton asks.  Short, about 4 and a half feet tall, stocky. He has straight black hair that falls lightly over his forehead, grown over at his ears and the back of his head. His eyes are nearly all black, beady and round, the quiet sunken eyes of some carrion bird. His nose is short and pressed up on his face, and below are a pair of thin lips that pull a length across his baby-fat rounded jaws. He has a pastey complexion, as though he hasn't seen the sun. Across the left side of his forehead and disappearing into his hairline is some mottled white scar tissue.         The crumpled and sweat-yellowed collar of an oxford shirt peeks out from under a wool v-neck sweater, sleeves rolled up to accommodate his short arms. His tummy bulges over the waistline of gray slacks that have been ripped at the cuffs and knees. His hands are short and stubby with black dirt pushed up underneath every fingernail. Peeking out from underneath ragged pant cuffs are leather shoes, muddy and scuffed to all hell. Rusty nods slowly and then suddenly realizes something. He reaches to shake your hand. The half of his thumbnail is missing and seems to be leaking some yellow liquid. "Rusty." His grin is strange, a little too big. He's smelly and dirty but there's something extra about him that makes him a little extra unpleasant to be around.  Birds of a feather. Compton is spooky too. Not scary-spooky, but weird spooky. Like he's seen it all, and stands outside of the normal way of things.  He gives your hand a breif single shake and lets go. "Ya from 'round here kid?" he asks. WEATHER REPORT: The fog lifts slowly revealing an overcast sky. Rusty shrugs. "I'm not from anywhere particular. I mean, yeah I live around here..." He crawls up onto a chair across from you. "How about you?" He wipes the back of his hand across his nose, streaking a snail's trail across a cheek. It gathers above a similar streak that's crusted over. Disturbed the crust flakes and snows onto the front of his shirt.  "You, ah got some..." Compton starts, pointing to his cheek, "Something right here."  "Yeah, few blocks east of here by the old GE Plant." *munch**munch* "How old are ya kid?" Rusty turns his head to the side and starts scratching at his cheek. The light snowfall becomes a storm. He furrows his eyebrows at the old guy's question. "I dunno.. I'm pretty old. How old are you? 100?" The sun dips below the horizon in the west and the Waxing Crescent moon rises behind the clouds with the ending of the day.  Compton snorts, going for a drink of the Coke, "Not quite. So, who was yer friend? A rich mark?"  Rusty furrows his brow at Compton. "Uh yeah. Something like that, I guess." He stares down at the table and then crosses his arms tightly in front of him. His stomach makes unhappy noises and he turns his head, going pale. "You live by the GE plant? I heard it was haunted. And has monsters."  Compton perks up a bit at this, "Really? Monsters? Sez who?" This seems to amuse him some.  Rusty shrugs at Compton's interest. "Sez everybody. Like, I dunno what they look like or nothing. Just monsters. And it's haunted.. Like and the monsters know everything you're doing and where you are and they're all hairy an shit like little uh waddya call it... gremlins."  "Ya wanna see for yourself?" Compton asks, barely containing a laugh, stuffing his hole with a wing instead.  Rusty snorts at Compton's dare. "I'm not afraid of monsters. I chase away monsters alla the time." He pauses and then opens his mouth to let out a loud sickly belch except for the smell he seems to be doing better after that.  "Oh yeah?" and a chunk of breast follows the wing, "What kind? Succubi? Dybuuks?"  Compton... says. Rusty narrows his beady eyes. "Yeah.. and.. and giant spiders."

      Naoko pages: Late last night, around 2:30 am, a really bizarre paradox ripple fluttered over the town. The epicenter seemed to have been from somewhere far off in the woods, about 10 miles outside of town. Naoko pages: Is that bait enough?  Gabbi State Park - Park Entrance(#675RJs)          The tall buildings may be seen off in the horizon, but obviously this area is not one of static business. Instead, the only real remains of city life are seen in the often crowded parking lot of the state park, vehicles of all sorts packed into the small parking spaces. It is one of the few parking spots that automobiles of every price can be found, everything from the latest BMW to the old Honda with a rusty bumper.         Up ahead, adjacent to the parking lot the actual entrance to the park is visible. A small ranger station is the first thing visible, where a ranger can be seen at all times manning the station and answering any question that may come up. Smaller booths are set up as well, selling various overpriced camping gear, t-shirts, as well as maps of the area.  Contents: Naoko Obvious exits: Gravel Road to Cabin GR  South S  East E  North on Gabbi N  It's night. It's breezy out. It's a bit chilly. Of course, the gal walking up the street seems to pay no heed to this. She's wandering, a bit confused, stopping from time to time and looking at the sky. When she does, she holds some sort of weird-looking binoculars up to her eyes. A frown, and she shakes her head. "God! Another five miles, at LEAST." Japanese accent; English definately not the first language. Naoko is looking at you.  The stillness of the night air is threatened by the sound of wet gravel being displaced from the road. Halogen brights tear the darkness apart as a behemothic Hummer meanders into view. The rain slick roads are no match for its traction but the driver doesn't seem to be the most competent, swerving and meandering over the road for no apparent reason. The vehicle slows as it nears the gates, a window lowering to allow the crisp air to enter and consequently push out the stale noxious smoke from within the cabin.  The girl leaps and almost drops her binoculars, catching them at the last minute. "Ohmigod. A car!" She stuffs the binoculars in the large duffel bag at her side and goes running, top speed, for it, waving her hands wildly. "WAIT! WAIT!" she yells, at the top of her lungs.  There is a crunching as brakes engage, the SUV grinding to a halt just in front of the woman. The interior is dark, windows tinted. Up close and out of the direct view of the blinding lights its easy to notice that the relatively new vehicle is banged up, scratched and not in the best of states. Smoke is exhaled through the open window and a tired voice calls out from within. "Awright there?"  The girl gasps, a bit out of breath, and takes a moment to get her bearings. "Yes.. no... I mean.. I guess so... Uhh... Hi." Naoko smiles oddly. "I.. uh... " She stops, and her eyes roam toward the sky, "Could I get a ride? I... I am kind of stuck."          Brilliant! That's the first word that usually pops to one's lips upon looking at this spry teenager: brilliant in her actions, brilliant in her speech, and, my god, brilliant in her appearance. Wherever this girl goes, she's always walking on sunshine. First, the basics. She's young, a teenager, around 15 or so years old. The heritage is clearly Japanese, for all of the features tell it true - the warm shade of her skin, the delicately sloped eyes of deep brown, the pert and gentle nose. China Girl, at first glance one might think, but unmistakably, she's Japanese. When she speaks, her accent most certainly confirms the ethnicity, while the times that she has to pause for her words confirms that English isn't her first language, either. A gal of small stature, she's only about 5'1" tall, and can't weigh more than 95 pounds, dripping wet. However, she more than makes up for that with the bold manner with which she presents herself. The jet black hair is cut short, feathered in the front like a flock of seagulls, and with an unhealthy amount of serious gel, she wears it spiked in every which direction, so that her silhouette looks like a starburst. Furthermore, the hair is streaked with vibrant electric blue, adding color to the mix. Her every action seems as if it were driven by a live current, with the setting cranked all the way up to "hyper-manic."          The future's so bright, you gotta wear shades - and the same is true for her clothing. She's dressed like she's ready to party like it's 1999. A white ringer t-shirt with the Pac-Man logo on it, and the words "Pac-Man Fever" is worn across her chest, decorated with red rings at the neck and sleeves. Over that, she wears a screaming neon yellow shirt, patterned with aqua blue swooshes that look like they were streaked on with quick strokes of a paintbrush. The skirt she wears is a bold black-and-white checkerboard pattern, and it flares out from her hips, reaching down to a few inches above her knee. Looking lower, she's got matching yellow leg warmers, pulled up to her knees, and stopping just above a pair of very retro-looking Keds - white with neon pink stripes, and neon pink shoelaces. The accessorizing is mostly in neon pink, from the Swatch Watch on her wrist that tells the time with artistically crooked hands over a light-up face, complete with a clear pink jelly-style wristband, to the giant neon pink plastic hoops that dangle from her earlobes. On each wrist is no less than 50 jelly bracelets in a rainbow of colors, intermixed with a few hand-woven friendship bands. Finally, the outfit is completed by blinding you with science: the overcoat that sweeps airily down to her knees is made of that technologically-innovative HyperColour (TM) fabric - the kind that changes color with changes in temperature. This one is in screaming orange, with spots of bright purple on it, indicating the warmer spots, and it's finished off with a chartreuse button on the lapel that reads, "Doc Brown was an amateur!" And that is Naoko - more fun than ninety-nine red balloons. Well, what do you expect? Girls do just wanna have fun!  The door opens, and the driver hops out. A cigarette hangs precariously from between his thin fingers and is ashed with the movement, grey rain floating down across his coat. He wrinkles his nose as he looks the girl over, then peers past her towards the sky with a curious expression as he takes a long slow drag. "Folks go home without you?" he enquires distantly. View items have been set on the following objects in your area:  If it were possible to shade such a sunny disposition, it did just happen. A wave of distress over her face, and the young woman nods. "Uh.. Yeah.." she trails off, reaching over to zip up her duffel bag. "Something like that." Pobble nods slowly, needlessly tapping his dwindling cigarette. He seems preoccupied with the night sky, staring up at it past the girl. The clouds are pregnant with heavy rain fall, and he steps past you towards the gates slowly. "Awful that is mate." he mumbles. Strangely, smoke continues to drift from the hummer, as if another ciggy had been left burning within. Or maybe there's more people inside. "Where'd you live?"  Her wide eyes shiver a little. "Uhm... Reno? Nevada?" Spoken as if she, herself, weren't sure about the detail. "I... yes, that was the last place I lived.. I.. I do believe." "Christ on a bike." murmers the man. He's tapping his cigarette in a rythmic pattern, silver tipped thumb hitting the filter where the four corners of a square about it would be. As he does so he shifts it up and down, up and down. "Maybe they left you here on purpose." he observes, the blunt suggestion being stated with the same dreamy air. He's not really paying full attention to the conversation. Something else is more interesting.  Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 4:  9 5 9 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  OOC Naoko says, "what is that for?" OOC Pobble does a Prime sense, to check for anything going on in the foresty area. You could make an Awareness roll.. About ten miles to the south and west of here, there's the fading away of a source of primal energy... like a battery draining the last of its juice.  Naoko rolls perception+awareness vs 6 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 0:  8 7 9 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  OOC Naoko says, "weird. it only rolled half my dicepool. ah well." OOC Pobble says, "Hrm. Either way"  The japanese kid shakes her head tightly, "No. They'd never, ever, ever do that. My parents love me very ... very.. much..." And she can barely choke out the last word, before tears start streaming out of her eyes.  Crying teenagers. The sound of sadness seems to draw Pobble from whatever trance he was settling into and he sucks the last from his cigarette before flicking it into the night. It skitters on the wet road and fizzles quietly. Turning, he moves to stand next to the girl, going to put a hand on her shoulder but seeming unsure and deciding against it at the last moment. "Hey. Sorry." He looks about sideways, searching for backup. Finding none, his lips twist into an uncertain grimace. "It'll be okay?"  Sniffly and still sobby, she replies, "Truth... truth is... I don't know where they are... something terrible happened... and... I don't even know where -I- am. In a big stupid forest or something... I don't like it out here." In the vehicle, something scrabbles at the rear window. It's impossible to make out a shape inside with the darkness and the tinting. Pobble ignores it and settles back against the wet Hummer. "So eh.. How did you get here?" he asks, sounding almost curious.  She turns and peers at the window, taking a step away to try to glance inside. "I.." She sniffs. "I sort of... sort of.." She chews on her lip for a moment, "Wrecked my car." Not a very good liar.  A small shillouette vanishes down away from the window. Pobble just stares, looking close to sympathetic but mostly confused and awkward. He's obviously not used to crying teenage girls in the middle of the road at night. "Where at? Want me to call the police?" he asks after a few moments silence, and not sounding too set on the idea.   Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 4:  5 4 10 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  She's clearly all sparkly. That much is obvious. But the most prevelant emotions are confusion and fear. Confusion, specifically. This girl has no idea where she is, what she's doing, what day it is... none of it. She's afraid, really afraid - afraid of what she'll do next, what'll become of her, and especially afraid for her parents. Underlying it all is a clearly highly creative and intelligent young woman who far surpasses most her age with her innovativeness.  Naoko shakes her head tightly, and says, "No... No sir... I... I was driving without a license, see... and... I don't want to go to jail." More terrible lies, the kind that she can barely keep a lid on. "I.. I just want to go someplace where.. where I can make a long-distance phone call, and... and figure out what to do."  Pobble looks less confused. Just a little. Silver tipped fingers fidget and to counteract this, they're sent on an errant into a pocket to pull out a crumpled pack of cigarettes. "Look, kid." begins Pobble evenly, "How about we make a deal?" The tiny figure is back in the rear window of the hummer, just an outline. "You tell me the truth, and I'll give you a phone and sort out anything you need to get yourself back on track?" He spreads his gloved palms openly, after popping a smoke between his lips and replacing the pack in pocket.  She rocks from foot to foot, and shakes her head tightly. "You'd not believe the truth if I told you, sir... no disrespect or anything meant, but... " Naoko smiles oddly, curiously, and then says, "I'm not a kid. My name is Xenon."  Pobble smirks at that, "Well, I am Dr. Steve. You can call me Pobble if you like." He sparks the cigarette, taking his time with the first inhalation. "You'd be surpised at what I'd believe." He smiles, but it's a serious smile. Cigarette is jutted out towards the invisible anomaly. "You'd also be surprised to know that other people will probably have noticed that, and they're definately not as nice as me."  "But... it..." She bites her lip again, and then forces a smile. "They won't find anything. In less than two hours, it'll all have reduced itself to its base elements anyhow, and sunk down into the ground."  Pobble shakes his head sadly, "Just because something isn't there anymore, doesn't mean people can't see it." The way he says this makes it sound obvious. Noting that he's maybe being harsh he manages a smile, trying to look reassuring. "I'm no stranger to bizarre shit. Trust me. You should come clean though Xenon, I can help you. Honest like."  She draws a deep breath. Her eyes roam skyward. She folds her hands at her waist. "I'm from the future..." she breathes, letting those words hang in the air, all dramatic-like and everything. "The future, Pobble." She looks to you and waits to see what you have to say to that. PLease please don't take her to the loony bin.  The shocking revelation leaves the Doctor looking unphased. "Right." he says, much like someone would say 'Fair enough.'. He nods, taking another nicotine dose and flicking ash off to the side where it sticks to the wet yellow body of the hummer. "How did you get here?" he asks, cigarette still between lips and waggling up and down as he talks.  Naoko shakes her head and draws back a little. "You don't believe me.. do you?" she asks, with that same wide-eyed expression. "I'm from the future. January 23, 1985," she tries to explain, and then looks down at her hands. "This is stupid. There's no way in hell you're going to believe me." Though every word she says is completely earnest. This broad must be out of her gourd.  Pobble laughs, inappropriately. This causes the cigarette to fall from his lips and fizzle out in a puddle near his feet. No loss. Someone inside the vehicle laughs too, a higher pitched but muffled sound. "I hate to break this to you," Pobble says honestly, "But 1985 is not quite the future." Standing up for this long is causing him to become a little unsteady, and wobbling to the side he twists and resteadies himself on the bumper.  Naoko looks you over once again, and says with a certain amount of certainty, "Sir," and waves a hand over your clothing, "Given your general apparel and demeanor, it is most evident that we are in the Vietnam-war protest era. Such people as you I studied in my American History classes."  There is sniggering from within the SUV. Pobble rolls his eyes, "Xenon.. When you were studying your American History classes, I was learning what fractions were." He shakes his head, smiling crookedly. "Also, being English I diddn't really give a fuck about the Vietnam war. I was too little to care about it."  "What time is it then?" she asks, now further confused at it all. "Funny. I thought... well, nevermind what I thought..." She regards you in a most curious fashion, and adds, "I... I've had...a hell of a day. I apologize. I'm.. I'm having a bit of trouble with my reality today."   PROVE: Naoko has the stat or ability echoes at or above level 2. OOC Naoko says, "From that, and all that she's been through, timepieces malfunction terribly in her presence."  Pobble pulls a phone from his pocket. It's a bizarre thing, like a borg cellphone that started out mini and then assimilated bits from other things to increase its size. It's wrapped in a cross of neon yellow tape and maked with strange patterns. He glances down at the screen and frowns. "Bloody phone is screwy." he mutters, and tries to think. "It's may something, 2004. Night time." He shrugs apologetically, "Sorry I can't be more specific." Naoko quirks her head to the side, and then her eyes nearly pop out of her head. She jumps, about a foot in the air, and smacks her hand against her forehead, causing the blue spikes in her hair to wobble. "2004!!!??" she squeals, surprised, delighted, confused, all at once. "I have to get to a phone. Immediately! The future of the free world may well depend on it!"  Pobble offers the contraption in his hand. Although it may be unrecognizable as a phone. He smiles, perhaps at your enthusiasm. A whisper from the depths of the vehicle says, "She's fucking crazy mate. Loony. Maybe she's.. y'know. One of them."  She eyes the phone, and then goes "Ahh! My father was working on one like this! Let's see... now... if I can... just..." Naoko sets the duffel bag down on the ground and unzips it. Dig dig dig. She finds this weird thing that's a tiny monitor with wires sticking out of it, and sets that on her lap. "Red... red... blue goes with blue... yellow and yellow... " The girl is now unwiring your telephone.  Pobble wrinkles his nose, looking uncomfortable at this. "You should be careful with that. It ain't normal. Doesn't.. oh never mind. I can always patch up a new one. Don't fuck with it too much and it'll be a secure line." He sighs, and the voice inside reiterates, "Fruitloop."  "Shh. I know what I"m doing." The kid starts wiring the device into the phone, and then pulls a simple 9-volt battery out. She slaps that into the socket on the monitor, and flips a switch on the side. An eerie hum as it powers up.  Naoko rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  5 5 8 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Pobble quirks a brow, which dissapears under the beanie. He doesn't look too suprised, but just leans there watching. Something moves in the open doorway, a tiny figure peering from the shadows. "Whatcha doing then?" he asks quietly.  "Shh..." There's an image that forms on the screen, for a moment. A bunker, like an old army base, out in the middle of the desert. She taps a few buttons on the side of the monitor and it zooms in. Cobwebs. Dust. Broken beakers and destroyed machinery. There's a big big gaping hole where some large piece of machinery was ripped out, and only the cords and connections left. The whole compound looks like it was a battlefield. Her face falls... and falls.. and falls some more... and she flips the image off. "Oh... my god... they've got it..."  Rising up on his toes, Pobble attempts to see what's on the screen better. The critter in the truck begins to creep out too, becomming visible in the backwash of the headlights. Dave Monkey clutches a cigar and the smoke trails up around him and back into the air conditioned vehicle. "What?" they ask in unison, "Something wrong?"  "The second prototype of the Tachyon Field Multiplexer... they took it... " Whatever this is, this is BAD BAD BAD, judging from the expression on her face. "The Russians..." she trails off, after stating the name of the most frightful boogeyman she can name.  Pobble half smiles despite the situation, "The Russians aren't so bad anymore you know." "Right." Agrees the monkey with the cigar. Pobble does look puzzled however, tapping his silver fingertips together with a hard almost metallic sound. "I have no idea what that thing is though.. is eh, that what bought you back here?"  "But they have it... that's... that's... oh god, the future of the free world... THe Russians.. the bomb... Oh god... It's all so... so... bad... " And that's enough stress for Naoko. The girl gets all flustered in her cheeks, and stumbles to the ground, planting her hand there so she doesn't completely bruise herself up. "I need to eat. I haven't eaten in over two days..."  Dave Monkey scampers back into the SUV and returns with an opened jumbo bag of potato chips. They scatter about as he offers them across, from his perch up on the seat.   Pobble sighs, becomming confused and awkward once more. "Look, kid. Lets get you out of here, in case anyone else comes along. We can get you settled and then figure out what we're going to do about it all.."  OOC Naoko says, "can we say she fell asleep in the car? I need to go."

      To those asking around, it's not too uncommon to find Damian here, particularly when there's new art up. He's here now with Lori and Jerome - and of the three, the seven foot Jerome really tends to be the one that draws the eye at first. Damian's currently eyeballing a painting of a shipwreck with a critical expression, and Jerome's looking fairly bored but well-behaved.  The door opens, admit one Pobble. Or half admit. A second taken to hastily suck the last from a cigarette including a small burn of the filter before he flicks it out past the dirty fella he has in tow. Stepping fully inside the gallery, he lightly adjusts the sit of his top hat as he holds the door for Cash, peering across with a sharp and determined expression. His thin lips are set in a crooked line, silver tipped fingers tapping against the door as he scans the room.  In comes those that don't belong. Unless perhaps, this gallery's patrons tend to be low end. Damian and company prove this theory false. And so Cash and Pobble's entrance goes noticed. Cash, the more sluggish of the two, follows in tow with denim collars propped up against the relentless foul weather of Erin's Valley. Relaxed, slumped and stumbling in alcohol steps. He's concealing a bottle in that jacket of his, no doubt moonshine of grandpa's ripest variety. Hard to follow his gaze behind the drapery of hair that covers. But he's behind Pobble in a purely heterosexual fashion. Eyes fix on the array of free beverages, but he stays the course lain before him by his contemporary. Into the gallery proper.   Lori is actually interested in the art. Her arms are folded across her chest, a bag slung over her head so that the strap lays across her body, boots planted firmly on the ground. "...and nobody does those really great huge, big fucking sea ship scenes anymore where the waves are like 30 feet tall and there's some poor motherfucker hanging from the rigging on the mast and the ship's like hanging in mid air at the top of a wave at a seventy-degree angle n' shit? Man, I love those. They're not ART, but I love them."  Must be that time of day, when people stop by the Gallery for either a looksee of new art, or perhaps a triple espresso from the cafe. For the redhead that soon steps inside, it's for the latter. Kirra is needing her caffeine fix, seriously. Graceful steps take her from the front door towards the cafe where she smiles at the guy behind the counter, "Hey there, Billy. The usual, please?" In hand, she's already got the correct change laid on the counter for him, sliding it across when he hands over the paper cup, "Thanks, Billy. Don't let 'em stress ya too hard today." As she turns away, words are over-heard, and peering into the gallery proper, she sees the trio before the ship picture. "Hey there. " That's directed it Lori with a brief smile before she takes a sip of the strong brew from her cup.  Damian glances down at Lori for a moment, then looks back up at the painting, pursing his lips thoughtfully. "They have movies about that these days, so no one needs it in art anymore. Attention spans like guinea pigs. In ten years, we won't have galleries at all, more's the pity." Though not directed at him he glances Kirra's way, then looks at Lori questioningly.  Lori says, "Géricault? Fuck Géricault, man. Romanticism is a waste of my goddamned time..." The rest of her thought is cut off, and she turns to look where Damian's looking. Monkey see, monkey do. "Oh," she says, "Kirra." This for Damian's elucidation. Lori lifts a hand to wave at her."   Pobble continues to hang near the door, side stepping to stand next to Cash, inclining his head towards the man as his gaze lights on the trio with the obvious bodyguard affliction. "Intrestin'. You know, I asked that old guy about buying that entropic peice. He never got back to me though, the fucker." His attention flicks briefly over Lori and Jerome before settling on Damian, lips pursed in consideration. "Think that might be him?" he murmers to his comrade.  A solemn nod, that's the answer Pobble gets as Cash reveals the libations he's been hiding badly under his coat. Lazy eyes follow a passing gallery goes before his worn sneakers get side tracked by the crackers with the brie. Cheese is good. Cash's spidery grasp scoops up a few appetizers as he passes the server. One is hidden in his pocket, presumably for the never ending winter. And when the chewing's done, he pulls from his dingy and unlabeled bottle. A few small rivers of one million proof run down into his bearded chin.   Kirra's smiles is a bit brighter as Lori speaks her name, a nod given as if to signal the other got it right, "How's your friend? Everything turn up ok with him?" She questions, seriously concerned before she looks to Damian, her head nodding in greet, "Nice to see you again, sir. I hope your day has been pleasant?" Polite is the redhead as she stands there gripping the cup of caffeine, sipping from it at times. Hand lifts, a brush of fingers to tuck away a dark lock, the light shimmering against the few studs in her ear. Cash and Pobble are spared a glance, shadowed green eyes skimming over them both before she turns back to Damian and group.  Damian regards Kirra for a moment, then nods with a small smile. "Pleasant enough," he agrees. "And yourself?" The rest of the room is given what was intended to be a quick glance, but his attention is caught by the rather odd pair that's just arrived. Pobble is merely studied for a moment with a curious look, but then Cash is given a mild but still fairly plain look of disgust. "Lovely," he murmurs to the two standing near him.   Lori shrugs at Kirra, "He's as fine as he's going to get." And that doesn't necessarily answer her question. Lori lets Kirra have at Damian, the pleasantries being exchanged and all. She turns to eye the wall of dark meat behind her and is about to say something but is distracted by Pobble and his hat and his coat. She lifts a hand, waves limply, but glances at Cash. She lifts her arm and glances at her watch. "Whatcha say, huh? Five minutes to the cops get here? Pick a number..." l  The blue haired Pobble raises a brow at the implication, whispering loudly to his companion. "I think she's talking about us mate." He doesn't look away from Damien though, a mildly amused smile forming. With a somewhat glacial pace he begins to head across towards the man, hands sliding down into the oversized pockets of his yeti-like coat. Although eyes are slightly glossy, there is a definate clarity to his expression.  And backing the skinned Polar-Bear, the drunk, having lost his shyness at being less than sober. Though it's only notable by the criss crossing path his sneakers march him. Cash, wiping the remains of munched cracker crumbs clinging to the mop of hair that grows with a will it's own. Bottle now corked, and stuffed back under his coat. Worn like a shoulder holster, complete with form fitting strap. A quick draw on the Bushmills. Fastest drunkard on the west coat. Somewhere behind Pobs, Cash stands. Looking extra casual about their approach.  Kirra nods once to Lori at her answer, no words given to try and say sorry or give condolences. To Damian, the redhead chuckles lightly, her voice an easy alto, "Pleasant enough, yes, even with the weather." Shoulders are given a slight shrug before Lori's words call attention back towards the other two strange men. A quick study, and she asides back, "Ten if they're lucky and the cops are busy."  Damian lifts an eyebrow as he sees the two coming his way, turning to face them, expression going neutral but still slightly curious. Jerome's showing more interest; the man can't really help but loom, gaze fixing as well on the approaching men with more of a warning glare. "Suddenly I appreciate Drew that little bit more," Damian notes idly to Lori. "I suspect I know where this might be heading."  "Well you're the only fucking one," Lori tells Damian, her brow drawing into a delicate scowl. "What gives, Pobs?" Lori asks of her acquaintance. To Damian she says, "This is Pobble." The other . . . gentleman . . . is ignored. Her hands move to adjust the strap of her bag.  Paying no heed to the imposing figure of Jerome, Pobble's smile grows just a small ammount. "Right. I forgot you all had a dress code. I was hoping to find Artus and negociate a deal." he offers, a dry and transparent guise in response to Lori's query. Given the casual hostility, he remains calm and confident, hand removed from pocket to scratch lazily at his chin. Smile becomes a mild smirk as he comes to a halt a short distance from Damian. "I don't suppose you happen to be Griffin?"  Large man, that Jerome. Small man, that Cash. They're now in close proximity, the smaller of the two looking upwards. Though unimposing, he shows no sign of being intimidated by his counterpart. On the contrary. He pulls one of the cracker he pocketed, offering it up between long nicotine stained fingernails. "You wan' a cracker, man?"  A sip, a look, and the redhead sighs, curiously watching the proceedings, yet slipping to the side out of the way. From a painting on the wall, to the gathering group, Kirra looks, brows furrowed slightly as she studies both Cash and Pobble, then the better outfitted ones of Lori, Damian, and Jerome. Hmm.   The name 'Pobble' gets Lori another glance from Damian, and a look of some recognition; precisely how much isn't particularly clear. He looks back at the man, then past him at Cash for a lingering moment. Distaste registers briefly again in the form of a faint sigh. "I am -a- Griffin," he agrees, looking back at Pobble with a small, amused smile. "I'm sure I am not the only one, even in this city. And no, I don't have any spare change. Or cigarettes. Or drugs."   Lori glances around very briefly, satisfied that noone is approaching the extraordinarily odd group of people. Her hands absently adjust the strap on her bag once more while she peers up at Pobble. When Damian speaks, her luminous green eyes flick up at him but soon return to 'Pobs'. Amazingly, she doesn't speak. One may note the position of her stance. That is, she is a step back and to the side of Damian, having given sufficient room for him to maintain his personal space yet remains near enough to touch.  Ooh. Burn. Pobble develops a wan and almost hurt expression that quickly dissapates. "Tres dole, mon ami." murmers the cockney, in a badly affected accent. A silver nail taps his chin before the hand returns to the pocket whence it came. "Damian Griffin?" he asks in clarification, a small glance given to Jerome, perhaps to see if he does in fact want a cracker.  Jerome doesn't seem to want a cracker. The man folds his arms across his chest, dipping his chin and looking down at Cash with a frown. Maybe he doesn't talk.  "Suit yerself, man." And so ends Cash's generosity. The cracker finds its grave in the drunkard's maw. The folding of arms is a distinct gesture of intolerance, impatience, or anger. Take your pick, Cash isn't phased. His callused hands dig into dingy denim caves as he munches up the cheesy snack. And he slouches, dull brown eyes drifting to the art hanging for its life.           "I'm partial to movies, kinda.." His artistic commentary, though it's unlikely to make the latest version of Art Speak. Cash, there's an economy of energy to his movements. Perhaps he stores it in some internal vat, ready for the tapping should a fitting situation arrive.  Glancing up at Jerome nearby, Kirra spares a momentary grin at a thought, head shaking a bit as she holds back a hint of laughter for some reason as she studies the tall guy. Dropping her gaze, she turns back to the two who question Damian, studying them further, listening to the conersation that comes. Espresso is sipped upon, slowly savored by th redhead who doesn't deem words from her important at this moment.  Damian looks back at Cash as the man speaks, and the distaste shifts for a moment into something more ponderous. But not too long, not long enough to be rude or dismissive, before he's looking back at Pobble. "Yes. Damian Griffin."   Lori watches Pobble, waiting. A thumb is stuck under the strap of her bag, potentially ready to pull it over her head. Kirra is forgotten, alas, in favor of the more compelling pair in front of her.  "Interestin'" murmers Pobble quietly. His expression becomes neutral as he slowly slides a hand into his coat, the motion similar to the one he might take pulling a gun. A crooked smile snaps back to his lips, "Been wanting to talk to you, we have."  Lori purses her lips and stares up at Pobs. One hand is extended to the side toward Kirra, a 'come hither' crook of her finger motioning her over. Lori's eyes never leave Pobble.  Inch by inch, attention shifts. Cash is used to glares, though he's the aura of a man accustomed to his lot in life. Kirra, Lori, Jerome, Damian, he's been given those looks one thousand times over, and they've lost their weight. From the mediocre art to the beefcake that stands sentry near him. A lazy transition and he takes his time about.           "You like Kung Fu movies, man?" This, more than anything is disappointing. "You ever seen Enter the Dragon? I've seen that movie four thousand eight hundred times...." Fingers come out from their hidey hole to wiggle in demonstration. Cash caught, fishing for a reaction deeper than arms crossed.  Kirra narrows eyes as Pobbles moves, his hand reaching into his coat. The motion of the finger crooked her way by Lori does gain her attention, the redhead moving behind Jerome and over towards the other female with a quiet step, keeping out of the way of the others as she does so. The look that's given to Lori is of a questioning nature, gaze divided by the other girl, and the guys.   Damian merely continues to regard Pobble evenly, although Jerome slides a hand into his jacket in a mirroring gesture of Pobble's own. The large man is splitting his attention between both Pobble and Cash, though with slightly heavier focus on the former. "So," Damian replies smoothly, "You've found me. Not exactly a huge achievement, but go you all the same. Bear in mind that attempting to shoot, stab or otherwise fuck with me in here would be really quite stupid. Or anywhere else, actually. If you have something to say to me then by all means, you have my full attention."   Lori moves her arm back by about half a foot, extends her index finger and holds it there in a 'wait' sign. Her head is turned to the side just enough so she can watch Pobble and keep an ear canted toward Kirra.  Pobble rolls his eyes, the needle point pupils loosing their fix on the man for the briefest second. "You think I'm some sort of fucking retard?" A terribly oversized boot taps at the floor. "The appearance of a crackhead does not a crackhead make." That's deep philosophy for you, spoken in tones that mock the underestimating statement. He snaps his hand from his coat, fingertips glinting around a crisp eggshell white business card. He twists his wrist, offering the card to Damian face down. In contrast to the sharp style hinted at by the glimpse of its front, the once plain back has been marked with a red sharpee in a ragged X. The smile that accompanies the movement is precise and professional, "We need to talk. Not here. Do call and we can do lunch or somesuch."  "Hey man" Lazy words from chapped lips concealed by overgrown hair. "Like, take 'r easy. 'N I won't snap that elbow out..." Cash obviously now looking a few clicks south of Jerome's face. Mainly towards that hand that so obviously tucked under his jacket. Though he looks anything but threatening, with eyes fluttering on the verge of a drunken black out. Still, his callused hands remove from their denim pockets to dangle on either side of his form loosely.  Kirra strangely obeys the silent command from Lori, her steps paused to the side where she might keep both the other and the men in her sights. Too curious is this whole scene, and Gods know the redhead is the curious sort.  Damian gives a rather disparaging laugh, though it doesn't seem aimed directly at Pobble so much as the conversation. "I don't know you from any other man on the street, and frankly, the majority of them -are- fucking retards. I like to err on the side of caution. So much easier for everyone involved. Lori." There's a command in that, his intention made relatively clear when he inclines his head towards the card the other man is offering. Paranoid, or just an arrogant jackass? Probably both. Jerome curls his lip in an aggressive leer at Cash; the hand doesn't slide back out of his jacket, but he doesn't look like he's right about to whip anything out and start firing wildly, either. Still doesn't say a damn word. Damian's gaze continues to linger on Pobble, then he nods. "A question for you and your companion, since we move in similar circles. Does the name Harbringers Inc ring a bell?" His attention shifts to include Cash as well as he waits for an answer.   Lori leans forward and reaches out to take the card from Pobble quite easily. Damian's command goes into her head, through her nervous system, and into her spinal cord, it seems, so that his will appears to move her slender body rather than her own. The ugly thing is that it's so natural, kind of graceful in a way.  The card relinquished, Pobble's hand returns to his pocket. He goes slip a glance at Jerome, seeming almost dissapointed at the lack of action from the bodyguard, lip pushing out slightly as if he's willing the big man to do something. As he turns back to Damian, his gaze lingers on Lori, a thin peirced brow heading up towards his hat in what could be amusement. Still, he doesn't question, attention fixing once more on Damian. "Harbringers Inc." he repeats pensively, "No immediate tingling of bellage. I can pry perhaps."  "You don' like... talk much, eh? Farrr out." Cash observes, returning the scowl he receives by Jerome with a needy expression. That need, another pull from the bottle stung under his jacket. And so it's uncorked again for a pull. Cheeks filled with whiskey make for a funny smile. One that's wiped by a dingy denim sleeve, tugging with it a few errand strands that are nearly trapped in his lips along with the gulp. His mouth smacks at the sensation. He enjoys it.  Relaxing a touch once the card is offered over, Kirra continues to nurse the cup of espresso, careful sips taken of the still steaming brew. Quiet she remains, at least for now, yet she does straighten, her gaze turned to study Damian's profile from where she stands as he mentions Harbringers. From him to Pobble she trains her gaze, that curiosity growing now as she listens in on the conversation.  Damian nods once to Pobble, though he waits for Cash's reply - or rather, lack of one in regards to his question - before his attention resettles fully on the top-hatted man. "Ahh, well. It's nothing of import, really. I was merely curious." He glances to Lori, hand lifting for a moment to absent-mindedly brush some loose strands of her hair back behind one of her ears, then the hand slides down to take the card from her so he can have a better look at it himself. "I'm sure I will be in touch," he tells Pobble in a more off-hand fashion.  Lori's head tilts about ten degrees to the other side as Damian touches her so he can better access to touch her. She doesn't look at him but looks at Pobble instead, her luminous green eyes affixed on him, trying to see past his third eye and into the contents of his skull, no doubt.   "I hope so. I'd hate to have to track you down again." Pobble replies, as if the tracking was something he'd considered unnescessary to begin with, the tone carrying a subtle implication. He stares in silence for a moment, finally nodding and as his lips once more comform to the proffessional and curt smile template. He steps back, boots heavy on the floor of the gallery. "We'll be seeing you Griffin. Do take care." he states, nudging Cash in the universal Time-To-Go manner.  This signals more wiggling of Cash's callused fingers. To Jerome and Damian mainly, the females of the royal court neglected. A messy spin of his rubber heels and Cash follows in tow. Not as an underling. More of a silent partner. And of course, his path out the gallery passes those tasty cheesy crackers again. One for the road.   Make that two.  Slightly distanced, yet seemingly a part of Damian's group, Kirra remains there behind him, shadowed green eyes watching still. As it appears this little meeting is coming to an end, she relaxes further as she moves another step to the side to now stand at Lori's other side, her gaze attracted by the painting there.

      The Pulse - Main Room          The Pulse seems rather aptly named, for as soon as one enters it becomes obvious that the name was given to the establishment for the resounding rhythms that echo across the club. Even from the outside, the vibrations can be felt if one places a hand against the wall - a pastime that is quite popular among the younger crowd that isn't allowed entrance yet.         The entryway to The Pulse is well guarded by two bouncers that check ID of those entering the establishment, a stamp being placed on the hands of those that are actually old enough to drink while those between the ages of sixteen and twenty get in without.          To the left of the club is the bar, although small it holds the basic stock standards. The prettier bottles are pressed up front although occasionally Jell-O Shots and other drinks are set up for the young crowd to sweep up in festive joy. On the counter side of the club, lays the dance floor that bears the amazing resemblance to a mosh pit more than anything else, a sea of bodies twisting and turning to the hard-handed music. Towards the rear of the club, a few tables and boots are set up, for those that actually come here for the conversation.  Contents: Lori Alabaster Smith Kirra Drake Andrea Obvious exits: Out O  Alabaster Smith sits down at Large Table. Lori is looking at you.  Andrea starts to pick up her drink for a swallow, pausing with it in half tilt towards her mouth as she looks to the man across from her in the booth, "Need?" The word carrying with it a tone that half says she's not sure she actually wants to get an answer.  Small Table (#1) has 3 empty places.  Large Table (#2) has 4 empty places.         Present is:  Alabaster Smith.  Dark Booth (#3) has 4 empty places.  Long Bar (#4) has 7 empty places.  Dance Floor (#5) has 15 empty places.  Alabaster Smith steeples his fingers, and nods. "Oh yes. Ah tend to peoples' spiritual needs, and crises of conscience." Pobble enters with a small crowd, waiting his turn to flash ID and get his hand stamped. He scratches absently around the mark with a glinting nail as he steps out of the influx of clubbers, fishing in an oversized pocket of his yeti like coat for cigarettes as he's caught in the unfailing gravity of the bar and drawn towards its promises of hard liqour.   At the bar, Kirra listens to whatever Drake tells, her, and then shakes her head, turning to slip from the stool she'd been sitting on. Another comment is made, words lost under the beat of music to any but the man they're told too before the redhead turns and heads for the door, weaving her way through the crowd that's entering, disappearing outside.  Kirra makes her way out of the club. Kirra has left.  Andrea doesn't move the glass from its halfway journey towards her mouth, the contents teetering on almost dribbling out the top. "Ah. Well. Thats very nice of you." She gives Alabastar another smile, "You must be very busy."  Alabaster Smith beams at Andrea, apparently quite sincere. "Ah'll admit it keeps me on my toes. Even though many people don't think they need it, everyone sooner or later needs help."  Lori is on the sidelines sucking soda through a straw, evidently, since there are no stamps on her hands. Her body is bouncing gently to the beat of the music while she enjoys the cold liquid. As soon as she finishes the soda, though, she abandons it and plunges back onto the dance floor to learn some more kewl movez. She certainly is an energetic little thing.  Drake listens to whatever it is Kirra has to say, then shakes his head. Runing fingers through his hair, he sighs and follows her out, absently pushing his way past anyone who gets in his way. The bulk's good for something at least.  Drake makes his way out of the club. Drake has left.  Pobble slides sideways onto a stool, easing his coat out behind him. Despite the warmth of the club, he almost appears cold as a slightly shaking hand lifts a smoke to his thin lips. A request is mumbled to the bartender, and repeated a little louder before it's understood. Once the glass of clear liquid arrives, he rotates slowly on the stool top, leaning his furry bulk back against the bar to survey the crowd, one giant boot tapping against the footrest.  Andrea is quiet for a long, drawn moment, a glance given as Drake makes his way out after the girl, the corner of her mouth quirking back up into another half grin. Looking back to her table mate she nods slowly, "I bet. Never hurts to have someone watching out for ya."  Lori gets run over by Drake and winds up on her ass. She's hollering something out there on the dance floor as she tries to pick herself up, and the words "dickhead" and "fuckwad" are prominent during the tirade to those close enough to hear it.  Alabaster Smith nods solemnly. "Ah can be a very good friend," he says profoundly, regarding Andrea.  Lori stomps back toward the bar. Stomp, stomp, stomp! "Goddamnit!"  Andrea watches him carefully, even the most stoic would likely get the bit of edginess to them that the topic of conversation is clearly starting to work into her. "Well...ah, thats good. Great even. I'm sure there's just bunches out there that could use, ah, that kinda help."  Pobble swills his liqour around the glass as he digs for a lighter, body twisting to search the other pocket and comming up trumps. A tiny neon pink number is sparked and a deep breath taken as he tries to focus on the tables and floor, his attention finally managing some form of clarity as it comes to rest upon the stomping girl heading towards him. He seems to tense up, as if convinced she's comming for him.  Alabaster Smith grins toothily at Andrea. "Oh relax, Sister. Ah wouldn't force my beliefs on you. Just remember Ah'm here if you ever need me, or the help Ah can give."  Lori is coming for Pobble... in a way. Or at least near him. "Hey, did you kill that polar bear all by yourself?" Lori asks as she gets to the bar. She sits on a chair and flumps, dropping her chin in the palm of her hand.  Pobble narrows his one eye, while the brow raises above the other. "It's dead? Fuckin' awesome." He leans a little towards the girl, to whisper conspiratorially just loud enough to hear. "It tried to eat my monkey." A silver nail taps the glass harshly before he lifts it to knock back half of the noxious liquid, eyeing Lori sidelong. "Something the matter then is it?"  Andrea clears her throat slightly, "Thats cool. So, um." She pauses again for a second, taking a drink before continuing. "You been, ah, helping people around here long?"  Alabaster Smith nods. "Ah've been here for a few months now, ever since Ah decided to make this city my new home. It's been an interesting time."  Lori looks at Pobble equally sidelong. "What? With the coat? Fuck all if I care," she says loudly enough to be heard over the music and shrugs. "I bet somebody spraypaints it, though!"  Andrea can't help but grin at that, scooting in her seat to cross her legs, "Good interesting or bad interesting, because I've learned there can be a vast difference."  Pobble frowns, confusion apparent on his face. "Why would someone spraypaint a dead polar bear?" He shakes his head before knocking back the remainder of the drink and plonking the empty down on the bar. He waves a hand in a circular motion, trying to wind his thoughts back on track. "I meant the stomping and Goddammit."  Alabaster Smith smiles at that. "Ah fear it's actually been quite a mixture of both."  Andrea shrugs, "Thats how its supposed to be though right? Too much good and the good doesn't seem so good anymore." It must make sense to her at least. "Keeps you from getting biased."  "Oh that!" Lori says, "Some dickhead pushed me down on the dance floor, that's all. I didn't see him coming, and he just brushed me off like a mosquito. Somebody's always got to ruin it."  Alabaster Smith chuckles, nodding. "Oh yes. It keeps us busy, at the very least."  Pobble nods glumly, peering across at the writhing mass of bodies. "Bastards." he agrees, "Seems alright in here though, I guess." His foot is still caught in the infectious tapping cycle, much to the chagrin of his leg which he tries to push down to stop it from jiggling.  Lori puts her other elbow on the bar so she can set her chin in both hands and watch people or something. "Yeah, it's all right. I can't drink, though, and I don't have any friends... so I guess all I can do is dance or something. Mleh. Hey, you got an extra cigarette? Can I have one of those?"  Andrea grins a bit more at that, "Well, you know what they say about idle hands." She stretches a bit, looking over at the belongings stuffed into the seat next to her then back to Alabaster, "If you'll 'xcuse me I think I'm gonna jet out, migrate around and find myself a place to crash."  Dennis comes into the club from the streets outside. Dennis has arrived.  Pobble pulls out the mysterious extra cigarette that happened to come free with his regular pack, offering it over with a lopsided smile that fades as he considers. "Don't have any friends? How comes?"  Alabaster Smith grins at Andrea. "By all means. It's been a pleasure chatting with you. Ah hope we'll meet again soon."  Lori explains to Pobble, "I just got here. Hey, can I have a light too?"  Andrea reaches over to grab her backpack, sliding out of her seat as she slings it over her shoulder, settling it into place before reaching for the guitar that was nestled closest to the wall to keep it safe. "Yeah, I suffer from bad penny syndrome, it's bound to happen." She grins at Alabaster. "Have a good one." Turning to make her way towards the door.  Andrea makes her way out of the club. Andrea has left.  Pobble hands across the pink neon flame. He flashes a grin, swivelling slightly on his stool to face the girl. "Well, Welcome I guess. Dr. Steve is me, pleasure t'meetcha."  Lori dips her head down with the cigarette jutting from her pink lips so she can suck on the flame. She takes a big ol' lungful of smoke as she rises back up again. "Lori," she counters. "What the hell is that doctor thing all about?" People don't see Dennis enter so much as they perceive a shift in the air. Whether it's directly attributable to him or not is up for debate, but there's a distinct feeling of unease in the room, as if something had changed in a way both subtle and difficult to pin down. It's the air of change, radical and swift and random, and perhaps that's what's so frightening: because most people, their protestations to the contrary, want nothing so much as some social guarantee that tomorrow will be a lot like today was, even if today was miserable. There are no guarantees anymore except change, and that might perhaps account for the unease which seems to follow Dennis around. Grizzly Adams, Mountain Man of Washington, Agent of Fortune, Butler of Chaos. Or, then again, maybe the uneasiness has nothing to do with metaphor and everything to do with the nigh-homicidal scowl on his face. Different philosophers, different ideas, all that.  Zoe comes into the club from the streets outside. Zoe has arrived. Zoe is looking at you.  Pobble shrugs just a touch, raising a hand at a passing bartender to indicate he's in need of service. "If y'earn it you may as well use it right?" Uncertainty flickers across his features as he pulls the last from his cigarette and stubs it into a nearby ashtray, blowing the smoke upwards away from Lori.           In the beginning, people didn't go to Washington State; they wound up in Washington as a way of getting away from other things. It led to the state's original population being self-reliant outdoorsy types who have become increasingly more rare as the state has become overrun with Starbucks and Microsoft. Most of the Lumberjack Brigade has already left Erin's Vale for Alaska, but there are still some holdouts, people who still seek self-reliance amidst the espresso and traffic jams. Dennis Larson is one of them. He may not be dressed like one right now, but his mien, his build, his air of self-confident self-reliance, give him away as clearly as day.         He's not a large man, being of average height with an average build. Yet for all that, his average build is solidly built, his torso a gymnast's wedge shape and his muscles lean and well-defined. He's quite fit, fit in a way which is rarely seen nowadays; it's the fitness that comes from exertion and work, not time on Nautilus equipment. Scars on his hands and forearms attest to a life of manual labor, and his thirty-year-old face alternates between tanned and sunburnt depending on whether or not he remembered to pack sunblock. That, too, is rare nowadays; in an economy where most people work indoors, Dennis clearly works under the Wenatchee sun.         His hair is cut in a short low-maintenance style, the Nordic yellowness bleached to white-blonde by the sun, with eyes so pale a gray they evoke nothing so much as bleach. Dennis is dressed differently than he usually is; his flannels and jeans have been traded for a suit and tie. It's not Giancarlo Ferre or Giorgio Armani, certainly, instead just some cheap off-the-rack thing that's barely had any tailoring done to his form. In some sense, the unassuming dark suit makes him all the creepier. If he wore designer threads he'd be less unnerving, because after all, who'd want to start a fight while wearing a five thousand dollar suit?         A two hundred dollar suit, on the other hand...    Dennis says, "As an FYI, if you're a mortal or a mage with a WP   "Yes, I'm sure that's all very interesting, but what /kind/ of doctor? Or are you the ooh-spooky-mysterious type? Like, what gives?" That's from Lori. She's gazing up at Pobble nicely enough, but the words coming out of her mouth are pretty unpleasant in contrast.  Into the club slips yet another figure looking to enjoy dancing the night away. After having her ID checked at the door, Zoe moves further inside, steps slow and graceful as she begins to make her way towards the bar. Lips hold a smile, and there's more than a few she stops to greet and speak with at times before continuing on, the skirt of her dress swaying with each step she makes.  Pobble delays the explanation to request another drink, and as he does so a mild shiver takes him, causing him to tense briefly inside the warm expanse of his yeti covering. He turns back to Lori, "Chemical engineering." Not so spooky or mysterious. Not even terribly interesting. A sheepish little smile is offered, as he glances to the side, needle point eyes scanning for something.  Lori looks all excited by that. "Chemical engineering? Rock!" She sucks on the cigarette again, licking the taste of nicotine from her pink lips. "I oughta do that, but life is too short to spend it in a classroom all the time, don't you think? I don't even have my high school diploma. Hah!" This amuses her greatly.  Pobble nods agreement distractedly, seeming unsatisfied in his search and turning back to his conversational partner. "Yeah, seven years is a long fucking time. Still." he trails off, lips curling back into a crooked little smile. "It was an interesting time."  Dennis heads over to the counter for a drink, albeit not without incident; some people are eager to get out of his way and some people are eager to get into it, usually college fratboys who've substituted liquor for courage and want to show the world they're not afraid. Dennis walks by them in stone-faced silence, taking contemptuously no notice of either those who edge away or those who remain. He finally comes up to the counter and growls out an order to the barkeep, one which does not carry over the din of the room.  Lori tilts her head away from Pobble to look at Dennis. It's just a big flop of her head, pigtails and green tubes bouncing with the sudden motion. Her big green eyes look at him pretty openly, sizing up the guy that makes everybody skuttle out of the way like cockroaches.  Who would think the tomboy could clean up so well? Surely no one that knows her and has seen her in her usual jeans and boots, grubby from digging in the garden. And yet, tonight Zoe seems to have taken special care with her dress. If she notices the path Dennis has made towards the bar, it's not obvious as she waves her own way through people, laughing at times before nodding to the bar before continuing onwards. Once there, she tiptoes, leaning against the bar, and making her order, giving the bartender a smile before he moves off to fix her drink.  Pobble faces away from Dennis, but his arrival at the bar definately unsettles the man. Silver nails tap together with a quiet clacking lost in the overwhelming beat of the music. He turtles down in the high collar of his enormous coat, pausing the tapping to toss a bill on the bar and take up his drink, clutching it with both hands.  Well, someone fits in here like a Preakness winner in a glue factory. Dennis's total lack of fitting-in is almost painful: he's wearing a suit and tie, not fashionably goth attire. He's wincing at what he'd call the 'noise', apparently enough of a cultural philistine that he doesn't grok the magnificence of Einsturzende Neubauten especially when played at high volume. He just remains silent and mute as the barkeep hands him an iced tea (what, no trendy booze and forty-dollar quintuple-distilled vodkas?) and--why, is that the sound of teeth grinding, barely audible over the noise? Yep. He turns to give Zoe a faint nod of recognition, and then turns to give Lori a scowl. "What the f--" He stops, shakes his head, starts over again in a concerted attempt at remaining civilized. "What're you looking at?"  Alabaster Smith has staked out his table like a little independent fiefdom in the middle of the chaos, and from it, he watches the drama of the other people with vague interest and amusement.  "I knew you were going to say that," Lori says. "Goddamnit, they always say that." She shakes her head in disappointment and looks away to have a drag off of her smoke, flicking ash on the floor absently.  Pobble indulges in a mix of ostritch and snake avoidance behaviour, keeping his back to the imposing figure while remaining still. Teeth pull in the corner of his lower lip, finger tapping uneasily against his glass still, being the only movement besides breathing. He almost looks like he's not exactly sure why he's entered this strange mood, but given his glossy pinpoint pupiled eyes it's not unreasonable to blame it on an acid flashback.  Wine delivered, the tomboy passes the money to the bartender before lifting the glass for a sip. It's then that Zoe sees Dennis standing off to the side in his suit and tie, a brow raised as she looks at him from over the rim of her wineglass. His snap at the girl seems to amuse her for some reason, lips quirking into a smile before she turns her gaze towards the dancefloor. Unconsciously, she sways to the music, the silk of her dress following each move she makes.  Dennis bites down an acerbic response to Lori and downs a rather large fraction of his iced tea in one long gulp. Mmmm, cold and bitter, just like his heart. A few of the bouncers are beginning to gather closeby, as if anticipating trouble brewing, but Dennis pays them no heed. Apparently he gets that reaction enough that he's become inured to it.  Lori stabs out her cigarette. Stabby, stabby, stabby! "What's the matter with you?" she asks Pobble without a drop of apparent empathy.  "Oh, nothing." replies Pobble in a tone that lacks anything that even vaguely resembles conviction. He knocks back his liqour sharply, smacking the glass back down on the counter. "Cold." he murmers as an afterthought, sliding hands into pockets and pulling the furry mass tighter about his body.  Zoe glances around, watching people, taking note of those reactions around her, and the bouncers that seem to be edging closer. Pushing away from the bar, she actually moves closer to the suited Dennis, and pausing near him, she lets her glance travel over him before returning to his face. Chuckling, she says lightly, "What's got your undies in a twist tonight?" Ok, so she might be dressed all fancy, hardly looking like herself, but the tomboy is still there and forthright as ever.  Lori reaches out to fluff Pobble up. "You should eat more! Put some meat on those bones... no wonder you're cold--wait, now I'm beginning to sound like... nevermind." She yanks at Pobble's coat, as if he's not warm enough in it.  Pobble should be warm, it is after all sweltering in the packed club. The close proximity of the bouncers seems to make him all the more edgy, pressing his side up against the counter top as he scratches his forehead just under the rim of his hat. "I shouldn't wear my coat inside, else I'll be cold when I go out." he murmers, mantra-like.  Dennis's scowl is the sort of thing which would be legendary if he didn't make it look so easy. "Same thing it ever is," he answers as he drains the rest of his iced tea. He looks around for the barkeep, getting visibly annoyed when it's clear the barkeep's trying very hard to pretend he doesn't exist. A bellowed order consisting of more vulgarities than prepositions later, the barkeep hurriedly comes over with a refill. Dennis doesn't pause to watch the scurrying: he returns his attention to Zoe. "People are idiots. That's what it always is."  Zoe cradles the glass of wine in her hand as she watches Dennis go bellowing for the refill, shaking her head at him quietly. When his attention returns, she replies lightly, "Some are, but you know, if you didn't doom and gloom glare at everyone, they might not be such idiots." A shoulder lifts in a shrug, a sip taken from the wine in her glass before her gaze slips towards the dance floor again, the music gaining another roll of hips before she shoots the angry man a look and grin.  Lori pauses in her conversation with Pobble to turn her head and grin sharply at Dennis. Something he said must have pleased her because she just has that kind of look on her face. "Hah!" Soon her gaze is back on Pobble and she chucks him a few times on the shoulder. "You don't look so good. Maybe you should come outside and get some fresh air. That's a good idea. Come on, get your narrow ass out of the chair already," she says, hopping off of her own chair. Sproing!  Pobble considers for the briefest of moments before nodding, sliding off the stool in a way that only moves him further from Dennis, oversized boots thudding down onto the floor. Hands push immediately into pockets and with a stooped pose he makes for the door in a roundabout path, almost scuttling through the crowds with only a quick glance back to check to see wether Lori is following.  "This ain't my Doom Glare," Dennis announces. Note that he doesn't protest. Protests indicate that one party is in the weaker position. The majority never protests the minority. The large do not protest the small. An oak does not protest a sapling. Dennis /announces/. "If it was my fuckin' Doom Glare, some poor sumbitch woulda already experienced what we like t' call an embarassin' loss of voluntary bladder control." He's not shouting, per se, but people are definitely doing the back-away-slowly thing and the bouncers are doing the creep-ahead-while-thinking-they-aren't-getting-paid-enough thing. "No, people are stupid, that's all, an' I'm fuckin' tired of it." Ah, at last, proof that he is human: is he not echoing a universal human feeling?  Lori is laughing at whatever Dennis is saying as she walks away from him. Yes, indeed, she is following Pobble but at a leisurely pace. What, like she's going to miss the big white coat in the crowd? She'd have to be retarded /and/ blinde. Or even blind.  Pobble wastes no time in making his exit, a wan smile given to the door men at their half hearted comments regarding the enjoyment of the rest of the evening.  You leave The Pulse for the streets outside.  Downtown - New Town District(#433RJs) -= Erin and Pike =-          Hip dance clubs and upper scale restaurants line the streets of New Town, everything from the newest teenage fad to old style swing dancing being seen easily on these streets. The young to middle aged crowd seems to frequent this area, a culturally diverse area with everything from the preppy high school jock to the pierced stoner hang out on the strip to find the new coolest spot to go on the weekends. The billboards seem to have taken notice of the party society in the area as well, various ads for entertainment places and items showing up more frequently than in other sections of the city.         To the side of the area a rather pleasant mini-park has formed, a statue of Zeus standing proud. At various times during the day and night, automated sprinklers go off to make sure that every plant receives the nourishment it requires for perfect blooming. Speckles of colors ranging from a deep violet to a cottony soft baby blue line the edge of the statue for a quaint place to stop and indeed, smell the flowers.  Obvious exits: The Pulse TP  North on Pike N  South on Pike S  West on Erin W  East on Erin E  Lori comes out from The Pulse's doors. Lori has arrived. Lori comes wandering out of the club after you, not looking at all like she's fleeing or otherwise upset.  Pobble is waiting just next to the door, already having lit a pair of cigarettes, one between thin lips and the other dangling precariously between his fingers. He glances across as a clubber exits, catching Lori as she follows and his brow creases into a frown. "Hey.. sommatter?"  Lori reaches out to snatch the cigarette from his fingers. "Huh? Speak up. You don't look so good." She resists patting his face, though, but only just.  Pobble shuffles back against the wall, still huddling in his behemothic coat as he draws a slow drag from the cigarette, letting the fumes drift out from his mouth to coil around his hat. "You look miffed is all, something the matter?"  Lori takes a deep drag from the cigarette he gave her and shakes her head. "Nope. Yes. Maybe. I always look miffed. Usually." She frowns at him, but not unkindly--if such a thing is possible. "Fuggediboudit." The girl looks him over very carefully, not missing much of anything. "So, Doc, what do you do with this PhD of yours?"  "Oh, stuff and things. You know how it is. The life of the freelance chemist is a dull and boring one." Pobble smirks at that, sharing a private joke with himself as he ashes the cigarette onto the pavement. "Fuggediboudit." he adds, mimicing your tones with a lopsided grin.  "Ohhhhhhhh, so you're a dealer!" Lori shows him a sharp grin. "No, you're not a dealer; you're too much of a pussy to be a dealer." Ow. She has another drag off her smoke, flicking ash negligently aside on the sidewalk.  Pobble smirks, "Right. I studied chemistry so I could better explain to customers how their shit worked." Glossy eyes roll as he pulls on the smoke. "Yes, I'm a pussy and a dealer." A laugh escapes him as he shifts against the wall.  "Better explain to customers how their shit worked?" Lori looks confused. She shrugs, however, and steps closer to Pobble, turning at the last second to lean up against the wall next to him. "A pussy -and- a dealer. You know, pussy dealers don't last long."  Pobble stares across the street, fingering the filter of his smoke. "I noticed." he murmers absently, "Fuckers." His reverie ends with a start, almost twitching as he glances back to the girl at his side. "I'd say I'm neither, but the former is possibly subjective given recent incidents."  Lori tilts her head so she can gaze at Pobble. Her hand lifts, putting the cigarette to her lips briefly. "Oh yeah? Interesting. You know sometimes I get it right. Anyway, what about recent events? Someone try to shake you down or something?" Lori reaches out and plunges her fingers into the fur of the coat. Oooooh... soft and plush! Okay, even if it's not real, it's still like a big teddy bear.  Pobble doesn't seem to mind the wandering fingers, "You could say that." He nods slowly, flicking away the half smoked cigarette into the gutter, gaze following its arc. His lips open as if to elaborate further then decide against it. "Well.." he says finally, turning back towards Lori with a bright but apologetic smile. "Would love to stay and chat but I need to get back, feed the monkey and lie down." A card is pulled from somewhere inside his coat and handed over. It's a crisp number, eggshell white. The name Dr. Steve and the address of an alley way in the Tackett Slums, completed with a cell number. Nudging your arm with his elbow he pushes off from the wall. "Call if you get bored, no-friends girl."  "Hah, cool," Lori says. "Hey, I might just do that. Thanks for the number. You take care now, okay? Don't get into any trouble..." She babbles on, waving at you with your own 'business' card.

      Outside the Pool Hall, Dark Alley.  Bob hears the door opening and quickly shoves whatever he was holding back into the trashcan.  "Aha," she nods slowly, a flare in her eyes almost draconic before it disappears and he has a chance to glance back her way. "They couldn't take a woman giving Arthur his sword ta do right, and had ta come up with all sorts of allegories. Lies. Ladies in water, swords in stone. Clearly its yours. Though I'd keep it out of plain sight." Ailsa stands in the mouth of the alley, watching Bob root about in the trash to pull out a shotgun.  The trash won't take it's self out. That's what Cash is for, his lot in life for the day. Domestic in nature, though still a grave necessity. It comes in the form of two black glad bags, stretched to their limitations by a misshapen clump of bottles in various states of breakage. Cigarette dangling in his worn lips, leaking whips of smoke into his face. If that cherry gets any closer to the hilt, he'll be in danger of setting his hair on fire.   Notting two others present, Cash muffles a 'pardon me' as he moves towards the large bin to make a deposit.  Bob steps back and smiles in a way that indicates he's very nervious, "Morning! Afternoon. Evening. Whatever."  Ailsa's gaze lingers on Cash for a moment, again that faintly greenish flash that must be a trick of the light. "Oh, bother," she murmurs in a tone mere shades above disgusted. "Figures. Why are the lessons always so pungent?"  Wait. Mental rewind. Cash is now by the large bin, both hands occupied by trash bags and a cigarette obscuring his vision and muffling his words. But did he just see a shotgun in the trash? Sneakers pause in the wet center that runs down the alley. Eyes shift between Ailsa and Bob like an interrupting parent.   "Wha' th' 'uk 's goin' on?" He asks, words falling clumsily around the smoke. Bending at the knees, one bagful is dropped so he may pluck the offending butt from his lips to speak clearer. "... like uh, who brought the heater to the party, man?" The editorial 'man' in this case, Cash is mostly focused on the nervous suit.  Bob blinks and looks at cash, "What pray tell are you talking about?"  "Our young hero has found his sword," Ailsa says smoothly, nodding once to Bob. "As his self appointed witch in the forest guide, I'm encouraging him to let destiny tug him along by the short hairs. Since she will anyway, its better ta walk with company than alone."  Bob blinks, "You two know each other?"  A double take towards Ailsa, if he were drinking it would qualify as a 'spit-take'. But nothing to dribble out his chapped lips save the remains of his cigarette and the last drink he had. Cash, now changes, ever so slightly. Feet move minutely farther apart from one another centering themselves directly under each denim shoulder. Brows furrow under the veil of hair and the other bag's allowed to join it's contemporary on the alley floor. He does in fact; look into the large trash bin. Is there a shotgun there?  Oddly enough, no. Said gun you swear you saw Bob stuff in the dumpster just a few moments ago is inexplicably gone.  Ailsa mms cautiously. "Not in so many words, no. But one storybook character can recognize another when they're beside one another on the shelf, no matter how dusty or disreputable. Are we done here, Mr. Messiah? There are places in the woods I'm not sure its safe to linger after dark, so far off the path."  Bob says, "Umm... Sure. just let me..." He looks into the dumpster over Cash's shoulder, then blinks alot. He moves the trash around alot then looks puzzled, "But... it was... right here." He frowns a bit and steps back. He looks at Cash, then Ailsa, "Yes... moving on might be good." He turns to walk over towards Ailsa rather quickly.  The young woman purses her lips, never looking away from Cash. Low, "Its truly not wise to meddle in someone else's story. It makes them want to turn your pages with greater attention. The sort of thing one presumes, living in such a location, you're interested in avoiding. Do you want to rethink that particular relocation, in the interests of fellowship and a kindly word?"  This will definitely require a long drag as Cash returns from the bin without the prize he was seeking.   "Hold the phone, man..." Cash says with east-coast spice. He looks to Ailsa and points two fingers with movements like maple syrup. "This is someone's backyard yer playin' dungeons 'n dragons in. I expect a... 'mother may I?' first, ya know? 'Specially from a cultured broad like yerself."  Bob looks at Ailsa like she's a total fruitcake, but comments nothing, insted heading for the end of the alleyway where he pauses to wait for her to join him.  "You don't have any house signs up," Ailsa remarks rather frigidly. "Nor were you apparently aware of someone waking up in your vicintity after a long nap. Therefore you've rather missed your bus. But if you insist upon this sort of path, its yours to walk." And turning, marches with a set mouth out of the alley to join Bob. "Come, then. There were seven swords of Wayland. We shall find you another."  Bob nods to Ailsa and heads out as he comments, "I don't know what's wierder... How   "My bus says 'College' on it. Look it up, ya wacki fuckin' broad..." Annoyance salts Cash's tongue and ash falls into the dirty alley water. Content to watch the two leave, this unlikely dawn pair. A wandering odd couple, perhaps on their way to get some breakfast crack. So it's with a laugh at that thought, Cash cracks a smile.   "Have fun stormin' the castle'" Cash does his best Billy Crystal and deposits the bags of trash.'.

      Suburbs - Bella Figura Ristorante          Italians have an exuberance for food not matched by many. Carefully and lovingly prepared, it's elevated to the same level as lovemaking and religion - and Italians know how to eat and savor their food. Meals in Italy can begin at noon and sometimes find people still gathered around the table at six in the evening, lingering through the last course of pastry, wine and conversation. Their philosophy is, if you eat well, you feel well - and if you feel well, all's well with the world.         The perfect romantic ambiance can be found here at Bella Figura. That same detail to the food can be found in the dark woods that panel the walls where gas-lit torches flicker providing dim lighting, and cozy intimate seating becomes reality in the use of potted plants that seem to enclose some of the tables into their own little world. Once seated, your server will light the candle set in the middle of your table before taking your order from a menu of elegant and fine Italian cuisine. Soft music is often provided by a wandering guitarist who will gladly serenade your table for a few minutes as they circle the room.                               'places' Set                                Contents: Lori Obvious exits: Private Door PD  Out O  Lori is already here, picking at a piece of bread that was set before her when she was seated. She seems a wee bit spacey... But otherwise mostly all right. There's a coke in front of her since she couldn't produce the necessary ID. Of course, you won't be able to see this until you get to where the table is in view.  Pobble wanders into the restaurant, looking almost sharp eyed. Not that his bleech blues aren't glossy, but some combination seems to be keeping him focused as he strolls purposefully across to the hostess, murmering quiet words to her. In response she guides him across to Lori's table where after flashing one of his more charming smiles, he slides down into the space opposite her. "Evenin'."  Lori smiles up at Pobble. "Hey, you made it... Try the bread, it's really good. I was doing my level best not to tear into it. I'm starving. How're you?" Lori reaches for her soda with a slow motion as though she might be a bit stiff.  Pobble's elbows rest on the table, a lazy silver tipped hand reaching for the bread as recommended. He eyes you curiously as he moves a plate over, pulling off a chunk with a spray of crumbs. "I'm decent. What about you? Everything alright?"  Lori nods and sips her soda. "Yeah... not bad." She smiles beatifically for a second at him, clearly not a hundred percent sober to the trained eye. "How's life as an outlaw?" She reaches for a piece of bread and pops a bit in her mouth.  The waitress appears, enquiring about drinks and appetizers. Pobble gives you a sidelong questioning look before turning to the woman with a warm smile. "Wine, surprise me. A good red." A quick glance to the menu at his side and he adds, "Motzarella sticks. Anything for you Lori?"  Lori thinks about it, "Calamari, please," she tells the server and gives her a brief smile before focusing on Pobble again. Her elbows are on the table too, and when she gets done munching the piece of bread she props her chin on her hands. The server heads off, picking her way towards the kitchen and Pobble's attention returns to the girl opposite him. His smile is crooked, considering her in silence for a long moment as he absently pulls apart the bread. "I wasn't aware that I was an outlaw."  Lori shrugs at him. "Y'look like one. Y'act like one." Her voice is somewhat lazy, posessed of a distinct southern drawl at times. Lori's brilliant green eyes blink serenely.  Pobble waves his glinting fingertips dismissively, reaching for the plate of garlic and liberally dousing it with oil. "Nah, not so much. Used to with my modified trashcan on me noggin, but those days are long gone. Bloody Aussies got wise to me." A small smirk at the deadpan humour, bread soaking up the extra virgin fluid. "So, Miss Researcher. He ask you to pull me over and dig a little, or is this a purely social visit?"  "Miss Researcher...?" Lori looks a little confused but continues slowly, "A little bit of both, but mostly me wanting to hang with you. Both of us are really curious, though." She shrugs and watches you as if you were a particularly engrossing film, the little glints of light coming off of your fingers and such catching her attention.  Pobble nods slowly, taking a bite from the dripping bread and half smiling appreciatively. Settling back he retains a pensive look, twisting the loaf fragment between his fingers. "I see." he murmers distractedly, again lapsing into silence as he tries to figure you out and not seeming to make much progress. "What about me makes you curious then?"  Lori drops one of her hands to the table so that she's just leaning on one, her cheekbone braced against the heel of her hand. "Uhm... mostly? I don't know. I think that's what drives me crazy." Shrug. "You're kinda nice to be around, is all. I mean, not... /nice/, because nice is boring... But, uhm." Shrug.  "I see." Pobble seems mildly amused, finishing the last of the hunk and not going for another quite yet. Adjusting his seating, any reply is delayed by the arrival of his wine and the appetizers. Once the server has gone, he repositions his elbows on either side of the plate before him, pulling his glass slowly across the table. "Just my incredible charisma then eh?" he asks, grin widening.  Lori frowns at him. "You're making fun of me."  Pobble laughs quietly, "Not at all." Pale eyes roll, wine lifted and swilled carefully around the glass, brought back over the plate in contemplation of drinking it. "I diddn't take you as being so uptight." he teases, a nail tapping against the glass with a strange sound. "Sorry."  Lori sighs. "I'm not uptight, it's just..." She shakes her head, causing the pigtails to bounce about enthusiastically. "Forget it. Hard to explain." Finally she sits back and grabs a fork to start digging into the squid. Mmmm... squid.  Pobble doesn't seem too eager to pick at the sticks, taking a long sip from the wine instead and nodding appreciatively, the tip of his tongue pulling a stray drop from his lower lip. "See now you've got me curious." He grins lopsidedly, but lets the subject drop. Wine is set back down. "So.."  Lori shrugs her shoulders and says, "Look, people assume lotsa stuff about me, and some of it's true and some of it ain't. I'm not that hard to figure out... Well... maybe." She offers an uncertain smile. "About as hard as you, I figure."  Pobble smirks, "From what I gather you're having a hard time of that so it can't be that simple." He shrugs, lazily leaning back against the booth. "I'm not assuming anything, that always spoils the surprises." His finger curls around the stem of the glass, wrist resting on the edge of the table.  Lori nods her head a few times and dips some calamari into marinara. "Not hungry, particularly?" she asks, green eyes peering up at him unabashedly for the moment.  "A little I guess." Pobble is prompted to acting, selecting one of the fried cheese sticks and lifting it towards him. "I'm on a diet." he adds, unable to supress the smile. A bite is taken, cheese stringing out as he pulls the morsel back. Chew chew chew. "Not been here for a while.. Not bad is it."  Lori snorts at you. "Diet... like hell. If you get any skinnier I'll be able to beat the crap out of you. Then you'd be all embarrassed you got your ass beat by a girl." She pushes the plate of fried squid forward in offer in case you want some. Pobble shakes his head, the peice in his hand waved in a help yourself-to-mine gesutre. The last of the chunk is popped between his lips, the pause resulting from chewing the thick and chewy cheese goodness. "I just can't help it. Blame it on a hyperactive metabolism."  Lori mumbles, "...or a really keen smack habit." She's at least halfway teasing you. "No offense, but I'm blaming the smack." Her fingers snake out to snag a mozarella stick which she promptly dunks in marinara.  "Never been a big fan of the smack." he half grins, "Although once I hit middle age, slow down and start to balloon I'll probably consider it." Either way, he doesn't seem in much of a hurry to continue his food, taking the wine in hand once more. "What about you then Lori? From what you said the other night, I take it you're a clean straight arrow?"  Lori snorts softly. "Yeah... I'm a real straight arrow..." She shakes her head and looks out at the restaurant, what she can see of it from here. Fingers absently rub crumbs from each other. "Not anymore. Used to be a bit."  Pobble raises a brow, "You used to be a bit straight?" Amused he shuffles along the booth to the corner, resting a thigh along the seat and placing his glass upon it. "How come you and Sam don't get along?" he enquires nonchalantly.  Lori reaches up to use the fingernail on her pinky finger to brush aside a couple of wisps of hair not caught up in her pigtails. "Because she's a whore and she pisses me off," Lori answers easily, reaching for her coke. She shrugs and adds, "She's Damian's girlfriend, so it's like having Yoko fucking Ono in the house all the time."  "You all live together?" Pobble asks, only a mild trace of surprise in his tone. Boot hanging in the air shifts to tap against the table support, the movement bringing ripples to the surface of his wine. "Sounds like a recipie for drama."  Lori just rolls her eyes and makes a frustrated sound in her throat. Hauling off and screaming obscenities right now probably wouldn't go over so well with the management. "Fucking hell it is," she agrees quietly.  Pobble tries not to smirk, but doesn't do a terribly good job of it. A lazy free hand rises to scratch a patch of tattooed skin at the edge of his goggles. He continues to stare evenly across the table, ignoring the usual conversational choice of looking away every now and then. Manners aren't his strong point after all. "Why not find a place of your own then?"  Lori shakes her head. "What, and live in some rathole I can barely afford eating ramen noodles every night and going to sleep praying that the stray bullets won't clip me in the head while I sleep? No thanks. Did that, and I didn't like it."  Pobble raises a thin brow, not ceasing the tapping of his foot. A swig from the wine proceeds the question, "Doesn't pay well then does he?" Subsequently the beverage is drained, empty glass set down unevenly and wobbling before it comes to rest.  Lori shrugs. "He pays fine. It's not like it's all about money or anything either. We're friends. That counts a lot more. I know if something goes wrong, Damian will never leave me hanging. And I'll never leave him hanging, either. You can't buy that with money."  "Very true." Pobble seems intrigued, musing quietly as he studies you. It's maybe one of those awkward silences, although the blue haired chemist doesn't look awkward. He steeples his hands in his lap, the beat of his fingertips tapping in counterpoint to the rapping of boot on table leg.  Lori watches you unblinkingly from across the table as you dissect her and try to take her apart and put her back together again. She's fairly used to that kind of thing, but the silence starts getting to her after a while. "What? What're you thinkin?"  Pobble shakes his head, a braid sliding over his shoulder and the sharp point of a cable tie poking at his neck. He doesn't seem to care, smiling wryly as he offers a shrug. "Just trying to figure things out." he murmers in reply, glossy pale blue eyes unrelenting in their stare. He blinks, a cue to change his position, straightening back out and setting elbows back on table, idly touching the edges of his plate with glinting fingertips. "So, where'd you guys come from before swaggering into our quiet little town?"  Lori murmurs with a smile, "Nah, I ain't gonna talk all day about me and them." She looks kind of sad for a minute then reaches out to pick up her coke to sip at it in a thoughtful silence.  Pobble's brows moves towards a frown, not at the reply but the moment after it. He doesn't seem to care about the rebuttal, the plate before him slowly rorating with the pressure of his fingertips. "Fair enough." A brief pause before the follow up. "What's the matter?"  Lori sets her glass down then scrunches into the corner of the booth and starts digging into her pockets. She shakes her head and gets a pack of cigarettes out. Once she gets one out of the pack she throws the rest down for you to take one if you want. Now she's gotta hunt through a bunch of other pockets to find a lighter. "I wish there was a fucking Hallmark card to say what I was thinking. It just gets so goddamned stupid after a while. 'Roses are red, violets are blue. I'm never honest. How about you?'"  Pobble laughs, only briefly. A zippo is easily pulled from his jacket pocket, handed over and taking one of your smokes with the same movement. "That seems to be one thing about this place. It's full of secrets." The smile that forms on his lips is a curious one, pensive yet entertained, as if mulling over some hidden intrigue that proves his statement.  "Blah blah blah," Lori answers, taking the zippo so she can light up the smoke. Afterwards she hands the flame back across to you. Two on a match is okay. "The whole world is full of secrets."  Pobble puffs the smoke to life, holding the nicotine laced haze in his lungs over long before releasing it from his nose. "Maybe." Eyes search lazily for an ashtray as he already moves for a second drag. Another one of those pauses finds a way to break into the conversation, "If your lies make you uncomfortable, why not just be honest?" The expression on blue-hair's face makes it obvious that he doesn't see this as a likely option, but it's something to fill the dead air.  Lori shakes her head. "Never said I lie, just that I ain't honest. And that's a different thing." The girl licks her lips, tasting the nicotine. "I dunno, I don't expect you to understand." Frown. "I'm a sorry sack 'o shit, ain't I. Oh, well." She ashes her cigarette at the ashtray and says, "Well, Doctor Steve, thanks for coming out and having a snack with me." She reaches into a pocket to pull out some money and starts flipping through it. "Probably I oughta go so I don't depress the shit out of -both- of us."  Pobble waves a hand at the attempted payment, "I got it." he murmers amidst a slow exhalation. "It was certainly.. interesting? Thanks for inviting me." The Doctor looks more perplexed than anything, entirely unsure of the whole event. "Next time we'll stick to less depressing topics eh?" The small pillar of ash is removed from his cigarette, barely making it to the ashtray. "You can come talk to me anytime you're depressed though, that's what Doctors are for right?"  Lori stubs out her cigarette after a last drag and shoves her money away except for a few dollars for a tip. There. And she wriggles out of the booth, but instead of walking off she swings around to the other side of it to sit next to you.  Pobble raises a brow, half confused, half amused. Bemused is probably the word. Angling himself around, he looks at you with tilted head, a strand of stray blue hanging over his goggles to tickle above his eye. The brow twitches but his hands stay in his lap. "You came back soon."  Lori shrugs and smiles up at you. "I needed a new perspective." She looks across the way at her vacated seat for a few moments before focusing on you again. Her voice drops down low and she murmurs, "I'm sorry I can't give you all the information you want. I don't even know if you're trying to hurt him or not. I think maybe you are, and that kind of upsets me, but... nothing I can do about that right now. I like you, Pobs, but I'm real... scared, in a way."  The topic change definately straightens Pobble out, shoulder resting against the seat back as he frowns. Fingers seem uncertain of what to do, almost tapping but not sure if they should. With the cigarette hanging precariously from his lips, the smoke curls up around his head, a thin hazy veil between the two. It's plucked after a moment, allowing speech. "I'm not Trying to hurt him." he admits, his tone quiet. "But, why are you scared?"  Lori stuffs her hands together in her lap, wedging them between her knees which makes her slouch forward some. "I don't know. Isn't that crazy? I think it's because everything's in flux. My life is pretty clear in some ways, but in others I get really seriously confused." She lifts her head so she can look at you, those green eyes looking mildly bloodshot up close though no less luminous.  Pobble lightly taps your arm with the back of his hand, smiling trying to be reassuring maybe. It's passable. "I'd ask what confuses you but I doubt I'd get any comprehensible answer." he says slowly, seeming resigned to the facts. "Aren't things always in flux in this line of work, at least to some degree? Or is this something else?"  Lori reaches up to scratch at her temple with a few long fingernails that are somewhat chipped and could use a good emory board. "Well, yeah, I mean you're right about that... Things are generally always in flux. But I mean me, personally." She sighs and rubs the table surface, digging the texture there. "See, this is what happens when I don't work enough." She beams a quick smile. "I start thinkin'." She lays her head on your shoulder unless you just dodge out of the way. "I also shouldn't go around this high, but I can't seem to help it lately. I just wanna float away."  Pobble's smile is small and secret, out of view of Lori with her head rested down, formed around the pulling of the last drag on the cigarette. An arm is extended, keeping his back against the booth to stub the butt. Back in his lap, fingertips fidget against the gloves that half cover his hands. "What's so bad to think about?" he coaxes softly, sounding concerned.  Lori lifts her head once more and yawns, pushing some strands of hair away from her face. "Fate," she says, stretching her spine. It cracks a few times, and she winces. "Ungh." One hand reaches up to rub her shoulder. "Cause sometimes even when you know something's gonna be bad you do it anyway. Dumb, huh?"  Pobble studies the girl's motions as if somehow the examination will bring some clarity to the vageries. Doesn't seem to, but he appears to get the gist of the sentiment if not the details behind it. He doesn't move that much, apart from the uneasy drug afflicted shifting of extremeties. "That's human nature." he comments, a flicker of amusement pulling at a corner of his lips. "We're all fucking stupid on some level."  Lori looks up and laughs at his comment, finding that to be funny and apt. "Nice. Yeah, we are. But you're pretty cool, Pobble. Oh, well. If you get bored, or need a date or just want someone to get high with, you can call me." She nods at him and starts wrigging out of the booth. "It's cool."  "Maybe I'll do that." Pobble replies, half smiling, distracted by thoughts. As an afterthought he adds, "I guess you're alright." this pushing his smile wider. He twists again, leaning back against the far wall of the booth, stretching a leg out into the space of your absence, apparently not intending to leave quiet yet. "Be good."  Lori snorts at you in amusement. "Yeah... I'm alright..." She shakes her head at you and lifts her hand. "See you later, Pobble. Pretty sure I'll be seein ya soon." She shrugs and stuffs her hands in her pockets and starts moseying for the door. Before she gets out of earshot she says, "Thanks for the dinner." And there she goes, wandering off to god only knows where.

      You push open the firedoor and head out to the hall. Pool Hall - Pool Hall  +time ========================| +IC Time |================================                    Current Time: Sat Jul 24 10:22:54 2004                     Time of Day: Morning (Daylight)      Weather: Clear Moon: Waxing Crescent          Temperature: 76F (24C)  ====================================================================  Dennis approaches the table where Lori's seated and slips into it without another word. He's carrying a satchel with him, which is a bit unusual--Dennis isn't often seen toting a pack. "Hey," he offers to her in monosyllabic greeting.  Lori says indistinctly, "I thought we were going to stop seeing each other like this." There's a note of irony in there somewhere. Be sure of it. She drops her boots off of the end of the booth so she can sit up like a normal person and look at Dennis.  The door to the office opens and shuts pretty quickly, once. It opens again, slowly. Propped open by a toe and a shoulder, the door shakes in its frame as Penny backs out into the bar. Dragging an overstuffed black plastic bag of something foul-smelling, she hardly notices there are people in the joint.  Then again, it /is/ ten a.m. or thereabouts. Not exactly business hours.  "You just wake up?" Penny asks apropos of a proprietor "Give you ten minutes, then you gotta go."   TWENTY MINUTES LATER     Lori says, "Sorry, stuff going on RL. Will try not to be quite so slow. ;D"   Dennis says, "Penny, I'm sorry that our poses aren't going to be allowing you much room; they're conducting some private business. :("    Penny says, "Uh. It's 10 am and my pc & others run this place. You'll need to respond to IC time and continue your business elsewhere."   Lori often hangs out here with Pobble in the mornings, but... whatever, we can go.  Lori has the door opened for her, and heads out onto the street. Lori has left. Dennis stands and leaves Booth with no light. Dennis has the door opened for him, and heads out onto the street. Dennis has left.  The opportunity for a scene was there and yet.. "RL" was conveniently in the way.  And then they tell me I won't be able to scene with them?  I wasted 32 minutes of my life on this. I think I'm just about done with these losers. If there were a way to negative-vote them, I would. If there were an easy way for me to /gag their existance, I would.  Fuck it, not logging in anymore.

      Caroline loved competition.  When she was a little girl, she grew enormous pumpkins that won first prize at the county fair.  When she was a little bit older, she tired of pumpkins, and started breeding and training horses.  Eventually, the horses just werenâ€™t enough to keep her happy.  The next logical step up was to have a baby.  (Welcome to the world, Tracy.)   **************************  My name is Tracy McGee, and Iâ€™m from Greenville, Pennsylvania.  Thatâ€™s about 2 hours from Pittsburgh.  I grew up on a horse farm with my mum and my dad.  When I was a little kid, my mum was always driving me to beauty pageants and talent shows all over the place.  One of my first memories is of twirling around in front of the mirror in some crazy sparkly red white and blue cowgirl outfit.  That was just three shades of special.  I think I knew how to put on lipstick properly before I could spell my own name.    Sometimes I liked the talent shows.  Sometimes I didnâ€™t.  Mum always said it was about being my best and it wasnâ€™t all about winning, but you know, when the judges decide that someone elseâ€™s best is better than your best, thatâ€™s not a happy thing.  The â€˜not about winningâ€™ line was just such a crock of shit.  Lucky for me, I won a lot.  Hey, Iâ€™ve always been cute, and I can carry a tune, more or less.  Mum put the prize money in a trust fund so I could go to college.   The thing is, I didnâ€™t get into college.   Itâ€™s alright.  I didnâ€™t especially want to go anyhow.  I was never too keen on school.  I mean really, when am I going to need to calculate the exact angles in a triangle?  Not in this lifetime, now that I passed math.  I wanted to be a model, or maybe even an actress.  It seemed sensible.  I was in the Pennys catalogue a couple of years, and once I got tall enough in 9th grade, I did some department store fashion shows.  But it was peanuts, you know?   Greenville is not a good place to launch a successful modeling career.   So the summer after I finished high school, things were pretty nasty at home.  Mum was pissed that I didnâ€™t work harder in school and get into a good college, or any college at all for that matter.  I was bored out of my mind working at the grocery store checkout.  One day, I just said, â€œFuck this.â€  I took my paycheck, bought a bus ticket, and took off for Los Angeles.  New York would have been closer, but I was aiming for Hollywood.  I donâ€™t really know what I was thinking except that just about anywhere else was bound to be better.   It was a warm, humid day in August, and a thunderstorm was brewing when I stepped off the bus in my new hometown.  Everybody was acting like somebody peed in their wheaties that morning.  I picked up a paper and took a look at the classifieds.  Jobs were pretty thin on the ground and apartment rents were through the roof.   Youâ€™d think Iâ€™d have checked the situation out before I hopped on the bus, but hey, I was eighteen and kinda dumb.  Anyway, I got really worried really fast.   The only place I could afford was a tiny little room in a rooming house in a scary part of town.  Random guys kept taking me for a hooker, which seriously threw me for a loop, what with me being all sweet and innocent and whatnot.  Then I got all scared that I was going to be in trouble with the law when I found out that my landlord was growing weed in the basement.  The kitchen had roaches and an awful smell, and the guys in the room next door liked to have loud obnoxious sex at 4 in the morning.    Iâ€™d been out of work and living on coffee and crackers for a couple of weeks when I finally ran into Renaldo.	Iâ€™d answered a vague ad in the paper from somebody looking for â€˜dancers,â€™ not realizing that he really meant â€˜strippers.â€™  I was standing in a seedy little office telling the guy off for being misleading when Renaldo turned up and asked, â€œHey, can you type?  My secretary just quit on me.â€  As it happened, â€˜quitâ€™ actually meant, â€˜got accidentally eaten by a giant alligator,â€™ but I remained blissfully ignorant of that fact for some time to come.  Typing was the one class I got an A in, and I told him so.   Working for a porn producer took some getting used to.  I didnâ€™t really like the idea, but I liked it more than the idea of having to go home and eat humble pie because I wasnâ€™t able to find work modeling or acting.  It was a few weeks before I could answer calls about Cindy the Slutâ€™s Anal Adventures without blushing or stumbling over the words.  I think they found it cute.    Dave, one of the camera guys, started flirting with me all the time.  I mustâ€™ve been so easy to sweep off my feet.  It wasnâ€™t that Iâ€™d never had a boyfriend before, but theyâ€™d all been teenagers, without the social graces and composure of the vastly more worldly 25 year old Dave.  Dave didnâ€™t beg and wheedle for sex - he casually suggested it, so I was never sure if he was joking or not.  After years of insisting that I was waiting until marriage for sex, I changed my mind in about 10 seconds when I was kissing Dave â€œgoodnightâ€ after our first date.  It got to be a damp, yucky winter.  My job started to include going a couple hours early to locations where we were going to be filming, brewing coffee, setting things up, and making sure the places were warm enough for naked people.  Dave started showing up early too, and weâ€™d fuck like rabbits before anybody else was supposed to turn up.  What Iâ€™m getting at here, is that Dave corrupted me pretty damn fast, and it was good fun.   One night, I was sitting at my desk painting my toenails, because the light there was better than the light in my room.	Anyway, I wasnâ€™t aware of him showing up (he does that a lot) but suddenly Renaldo was there, staring at me like I was a visiting Martian.  I donâ€™t remember exactly what happened after that, except that Renaldo was being awfully friendly and there were margaritas involved, and somehow I ended up calling my parents for the first time since I left home and getting in a drunken, screaming fight with them.   A week later, when I was just getting back on an even keel, two videotapes turned up on my desk.  I was pretty surprised to see that they were addressed to me.  I popped one into the VCR to see what it was.  It turned out to be a low quality videotape of some fetish party, but not so low quality that I didnâ€™t recognize Dave with the new haircut Iâ€™d given him.  He was flogging some girl and then he took a leak all over her.  I was like, excuse me, but didnâ€™t he just tell me to my face a week ago that he was totally turned off by that kind of thing?  The other video was along the same lines.  When I called him up to give him hell about it, he tried to tell me that it wasnâ€™t him, then say he didnâ€™t remember doing it and maybe he was drunk at the time.  I wasnâ€™t buying it, and I basically told him to go to hell, but in a longer, more descriptive kinda way.  So I was sitting there feeling crappy and brooding when Renaldo turned up again.  You can put two and two together because youâ€™re hearing me tell it, and I put two and two together long ago.  But at the time, it didnâ€™t occur to me that Renaldo had any ulterior motives or anything to do with the tapes.  He just turned up, saw that I was out of sorts, and took me home and gave me a bunch of alcohol to take the edge off.

      Here's what I got so far. I been waitin' on that lazy fag Anthony to work on his so I could link the embrace 'n whatnot.     Renaldo DeCuba Sabido  Young Renaldo played in Mexico City, one of the largest cities in the world. Itâ€™s actually built atop a lake, and portions of the sprawl sometimes sink. Thatâ€™s a little known fact in the States. Presently, it boasts air quality worse than Los Angeles, a mighty claim to fame. In the seventies though, it wasnâ€™t that bad yet. Thatâ€™s when Renaldo was coming into his own. Busting the Mexican Disco. Ranchero Hats and huge collars. This was his scene, when he was in his young twenties. Ludes, drinks and cocaine from South America, Mexico took the disco era particularly well.  Given its loose boarders and corrupt law enforcement most anything was possible. Hereâ€™s where he lavished and became a man. A very strange and slightly twisted man, but a man never the less. But most of all, Renaldo was handsome. Very much so. His Father was a Spaniard, his mother a Cuban, both immigrants of a flamboyant foreign nature to Mexico. They were rich, his parents having toiled out a fortune importing Cuban cigars.  He grew up fairly educated, but like most kids with way too much money, school wasnâ€™t a priority. He was mostly focused on fun, the adult kind, even in his early teens. Renaldo would be the first one to try a cigarette amongst his peers, first even to try a â€˜funnyâ€™ cigarette. Rich hoodlums tend to be overly indulgent in all facets. So when the Disco scene hit, Renaldo was ready for it.  Of course his parents, pillars of financial accomplishment that they were, intended nothing but the best from him. They were planning on shipping the young upstart to Spain for college and a business degree. But of course the best laid plans are often laid to waste, as Renaldoâ€™s frequent truancy ruins his grades and chances at higher education.  Plan B for Renaldoâ€™s future was to put him working for his father to gain aâ€™ hands onâ€™ experience at the  business and perhaps someday join his Cigar importing establishment. Again, he was a disappoint. By now, he had discovered his true love in life. He was rich, young, and handsome, he couldâ€™ve had anything. Coke or women, money or power. But what he loved above all things; were feet. The attraction was preternatural for him, a base animal instinct drawn to the arch, toes and heels.   Able to fairy women in his 75 El Camino rather easily back to his parentsâ€™ mansion, he could have any foot he wanted on any given evening. The feet of Mexico City were his for the taking, despite the women they were attached to.   Cocaine and porn go together like peanut butter and jelly. With the habit he had built, the good looks that graced him, and the money lavishly spent from his parentsâ€™ fortune, he fell into the 70â€™s swinger scene. Orgies, bondage parties, novella starlets it was one crazy waist. A big crazy waist of his fatherâ€™s money. Soon, his parents grew tired of Renaldoâ€™s lack of character and ambition. When he turned 22, they cut him off. Thus began his cocaine career.   Indeed, Renaldo needed something to pay for the lavish life style heâ€™d come accustomed to. And though lacking in any real skills that would produce fiduciary results, he definitely knew quite a lot of people who were into coke in the mid seventies. This is probably the point in his life that the genetic qualities passed on by his successful father made themselves apparent. They manifested in a good business sense, for in fact, just like his father Renaldo was involved in importing and exporting.   Yes, big in the discothÃ¨ques. He was t he fucking man. Even had the dance moves, bell bottoms to boot. The lure of this life delved him deeper into his perversions though, his foot lust ran rampant. There wasnâ€™t a girl in Mexico City at the time that would show a little heel for an eight ball. And Renaldo had straws for them all.   There was street power that came with his chosen career, most power which he corrupted to his own perversions. A video collection began of his sexual exploits, featuring the feet of many a B actress in the budding Mexican Film industry.   It wasnâ€™t long till these cocaine induced foot orgies formed into a secret and growing entity living in his closest like a hide fungus feeding on perversion. In grew, and twisted his sexual tastes as cancer does flesh. He became a cartoon of himself. This pompadour, greasy â€˜stached Mexican, suave and sexually dangerous. The danger part though, was about to make itâ€™s self more prominent.  Needless to say, cocaine draws a nasty criminal element. Deals and such go bad, and these types of folk arenâ€™t known for their kindness. And devoid of mercy was the incident that left Renaldo shot in the gut and left for dead all the way out the city and towards the pyramid of the Moon. Yes, almost dead. Bleeding on the dirt road that smelled of elephants from the nearby carnival. He took one in the gut over 2 keys, and he deserved it.   But thatâ€™s about the time he decided a change of career was in order. Sure, he could live out a few more years perusing illegal avenues and making more than his share of profit from it. This incident had reminded him of the greater things in life. The easiest route was now proven to be the most dangerous. Where it led seemed to matter very little, only that it was a road onward and somewhere towards the end of fruitful labors. But mortal risks were not an acceptable road bump on his way to uncertain destiny.   When the money ran dry, and heâ€™d given up sellingâ€™ coke, of all unlikely sources, salvation came cloaked in the guise of perversion. As a wealthy club proprietor offered to by most of his library.  A rich old queen he was, Fernando Valdez. Heâ€™d had a crush on the young disco king for half a decade and had previous tried to lure Renaldo into his bed for cash. In the days when the cocaine flowed freely, the thought of taking up this offer never crossed his mind. Fernando, seeing his fancy for Renaldo would never be returned, tried in vain for many years to buy the films the Disco king had made of his sexual exploits. And given his affluence, Renaldo always refused.  But now, the well was dry. Frightened off from the narcotic trade by his near death experience, he searched desperately for a new source of income. Renaldo, having exhausted his opinions, submitted to Fernando and began selling his foot fetish orgies. Reluctantly at first, but when he found he could charge large amounts of money for these films from the perversely starved and infatuated Fernando, the idea became more attractive.   Fernando, and his cabal of rich real estate bondage addicts, began throwing S&M parties revolving entirely around Renaldoâ€™s foot fetish movies. In short, he had found and new and even easier path to the fortunes of the affluent. Cut off from his rightful familial fortune, run from the cat mouse game of the narcotic underworld, he began to prey upon the perversions of the upper class. He could cater to the coke habits of a thousand men in bell bottoms, and never make the same kind of money he could pull by filming an hour and half toe sucking fest.   There began the start of his second career. Suddenly he found himself wearing the directorâ€™s hat, gathering the swinger friends heâ€™d collected at the various sexually loose fiestas heâ€™d attended in wilder days. The late twenties were a time of financial maturity. And Renaldo had a plan.   Soon a business was formed around this plan. And so the eighties began, and the porn industry moved from winter bush to teased and feathered hair. Though his niche, the foot, stayed constantly obscure and consistently a big seller.  Specialty markets in general, often have very few competitors, if not outright monopolies. Thus the foot fetish market of the early eighties is described. There were only a handful of people doing it at that time in Mexico City, and Renaldo knew them all. Contemporaries perhaps, though he viewed them as lesser. Their films, their â€˜artâ€™ hopelessly contrived and not spawned from the mind of a person who themselves suffers from a severe foot fetish.  Renaldoâ€™s films, well they were different. They were by the people and for the people. This was foot films, made by a foot lover. Not some indifferent hack looking to but in on a novelty market. One felt the true love for feet in his movies.   Now, when the Sabbat exerted full control over Mexico City, it did in fact drive most of the Camarilla out and into Northern America. Well, at least out of the city proper. Nosferatu, they went down, not out. For the creeps and sewer rats that dwelled below Mexico City have hid there since the days of General Santa Ana. The Nossie Sabbat ran above ground, as they feared no one, protected by the Sword of Caine. Though still, the sewer rats lurked the bowels of the city uncontested save the occasional nest of rats that were protected by the Rat Incarna herself. The Nossie learned to avoid these â€˜Monstersâ€™ under Mexico, it was far better than the alternative of open conflict. This was something known from way back to the years of the Aztecan empire. Besides acting under the Sword of Caine, many Nossies found it easy to set up minor Fagins in the city proper that could operate without Sabbat interference. The Sect was at war after all, a greater entrenched enemy rotted out there in their European castles than some local scumbags loyal to the netherworld.   There was a Fagin, Caesar Depaulo. Childer of el General De Guapo. Besides having his fingers in several illicit underworld pies, he also entertained a mortal taste for the perverse. Sex, though useless to the undead, was to him a spectacle of the farce of mortality. The act of procreation theatrically transformed into an intricate array of specialty niches, one for every convincible type of perversion. He was the true Kingpin of Mexicoâ€™s cocaine trade, despite delusions of grandeur Renaldo entertained during his brief attempt to play the part of an affluent drug dealer. After all, Renaldo was never particularly good at it; he just sold coke for the Pussy. Well, the Pussy and the Feet, which were equal in their weight of bounty for him.  Caesar happened to control a key few Mexican citizens. Strategically chosen for the access they granted to mortal influence. A variety of influences. Fernando offered a direct like to the twisted underbelly of the rich and famous. Sometimes Fernandoâ€™s S&M parties would attract governors, millionaires, and the occasional visiting Rock star. Each visitor carrying a bounty of information and damaging secrets. Open for blackmail and many other advantageous avenues, this helped those below. And Caesar was praised for latching onto such an untapped wealth of opportunity and covert subversion.   But as the apple rots, so did Fernando. He died when the Aids epidemic began, one of the first actually. This left a gap in the Mexican Fetish scene, ripe for the taking. Caesar, through his various influences, sequestered the mansion Fernando would throw these S&M parties in and anonymously betrothed it to Renaldo. He was the heir apparent to the thrown of perversion. Caesar would prop Renaldo up as his new lord of leisure and cinematic deviant.  Wasnâ€™t hard much, Renaldo was used to having things handed to him given his rich upbringing. Naturally Fernando, his patron and admirer would bequeath his fortune to the only family an aging queen had.   He was ghouled by the Fagin Caesar De Guapo, quite easily, and during one of his movie shoots. One of his rare onscreen appearances, Renaldo gave the movie a brief flash of his own foot lust and topped it with a full cup of vitae. This of course, was just some new pervert testing the limits of sexuality and the grotesque. Hey, Renaldo liked feet, thereâ€™s no reason why Cease couldnâ€™t enjoy blood play. It wasnâ€™t unheard of.   But soon the foot lust turned red, and he began craving the company and blood of Caesar after he had entertained him at Fernandoâ€™s former estate one night. Now, Renaldoâ€™s not actually bisexual, but heâ€™s able to appreciate the feet of both genders equally in his particular fantasies. He remembers something about worshipping Caesarâ€™s feet, and since then heâ€™s been dominated by his regent. Unknowingly at first, but this couldnâ€™t last long.

      The phrase literally translated reads: As you now possess - it is a phrase from the time of Justinian meaning that at the termination of hostilities the contending parties are to retain whatever territory they may have gained during the war... unless a treaty rules otherwise.  How did we win our position? This should be the subject of at least one storyline.
