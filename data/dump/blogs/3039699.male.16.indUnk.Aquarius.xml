      Posting the Bios we wrote before Eric can!   Stan Voortman:  reserved, shy, has a crush on Marianne but would never admit it. Does not belive easily, very skeptical.   Chris Allo  Sly, mnipulative fahion designer, witty womanizer. Best friends (george and stan) in love with stephanie.   Mabel Allo  Brother of Chris, no too bright, has comic strip, hangs around, no real job, purehearted.  Yes, I know they need work, but we were writhing these on Eric's pager and a PDA...  On a bus.  Give us a break. :5

      After that quite violent sporking, I know you all were worried about my health, but I live again.  Eric forgot to cover the spork with palmino dust.  Anyways, yeah.  Sandusky tomorrow thru Sunday, so we can hopefully get some scripting and the bios done.  Make Eric find the batteries for his laptop.... I'm out.

      While waiting for Eric to join, I thought I should make a to-do list for all this.  1) Character Bios 2) More detailed Synopsis 3) Finish Scripting 4) Finish Songs  That's it for now.

      Hm... I have to get started? Well, we know that George and Karol and Chris and Stephanie all fall in love.  Does Stan fall in love with Marianne?  We hadn't decided.  The sheriff is always trying to find some way to get Chris for something.  Elijah Brooks (a government agent, if I recall) is one of those crazy, by-the-book people that only follow official procedure.  He will try to reposes the carnival later on, in the end of act 2.  The ringleader is enchanting, think Moulin rouge style.    Back to you, eric.

       Well, In my humble opinion, P9 needs to move away from cookie-cutter Emo and toward a whole new style... Think Classic rock... Really not sure.  But I really think the band needs a new sound... Really Badly...  Yay!

       Hey all! this is TC, i am in. my email wouldnt accept miks' invitation. oh well...so life for p9?hmm...well. lots of stuff. like new equipment..and new better songs. right now im working on one sort of epic, called One Week. It's basically a story of everything going wrong in one week, and how u just have to get through it. theres 3 other songs that me and mike are workin on too. 1-its based on the ol "Two Years" if anyone remembers that song, its the same music basically, a lot grander though. 2-an awesome song miks wrote, really good, were workin on music. 3- this song will also be on acoustyx. its about getting over someones death.   our subjects are obviously deepening. but dont worry if you liked our strange love songs, cause there will still be more. were just growing as writers, with new changes in life are new subjects.     thats all for now. i will also give an update on the new band member soon to.  This IS it, from TC

       whoa its almost july...well the band has practiced, its true we did. we have a bunch of new songs, and these are real, theyve been put together with the band. one is Miss Popular, by me. "there she goes there she goes, miss popular, everything in the world goes right for her, everything she wants is at her feet shes another success, for abercrombie and fitch." hehe i love that line. the other one doesnt really have a title yet. its got really cool harmony, still bein worked on, or "perfected". soon mike is gonna record his song "Capo3" for Acoustyx. finally that one is almost done. and once we have time the good version of Can't get it right, featuring Steph P. awesome, her voice is amazing. hmmm what else. We are searching on a new title for the cd. mike has some kickin graphics and stuff. weve got help from some of our friends who are artists. but...any of you out there who want to throw in your opinion or idea, picture anything, send it to us at Platinum9rock@yahoo.com  its checked daily, haha. you could win a the new cd, perhaps signed, if you want our terrible hand writing on it...or some merch or something, word.

       So, yes, we're in the studio. We've been practicing lately and writing a lot. In fact, Miks there wrote a killer new song, although it's on Acoustyx, which only needs a couple more songs than it's done. The studio this time is a lot nicer, more space, more time. LRH was done in a week. Actually, we wrote Their Last Dance in a day. So...this should be better. We're investing in merch too. yay. Posters are fun. Although we're no filmore so, theres no cool stuff, but...meh. We turned down the tours we were offered because it had been so long since we had practiced. Sorry everybody. The p9 site will get more updates weekly now too. So soon. What else...lots of new songs, really, its pretty cool. The sound is a lot more gorwn up. We listened to one of our friends songs and we realized that, that's where we came from. Pretty cool to see that we grew. Juniors in highschool...damn. 5 years of p9. thats so cool. It hasn't been super easy for us but it never is. what else...We might  play a few shows this summer. depending on the new CD. which doesn't have a title yet, but lots of ideas. some with feet. When you hear the stuff you'll definatly hear that were thinking more and growing. I have seemingly gotten out of the Starting Line faze. Although they rock, I've been checking out "The Matchbook Romance" "Mae" "Taking Back Sunday" Deja Entendu by "Brand New" and the new "New Found Glory". Summer is starting and so is the new P9 so watch out...

       Hey everyone this is an update on P9. The year is closing, summer is days away and we're gearing up to finish acoustyx and begin the new P9. right now, this instint where I'm posting right now...I'm talking about promotion, if you read this, comment and give this url to others who could like this music, spread the P9 word around please. All mike thinks is its hijm me and one other person here, but he's assuming the worst. So, spread the P9 word. And keep checking back for more information on the new cds.   TC

        Oh man... the P9 bio page still says I'm with Kristin... I'd like you all to know that I'll fix that in a bit... but I can't at tme moment.  But, for the record, I am NOT dating Kristin anymore...  Yeah, thats all for now.  I'm out, rock on.  Oh, Be watching here for some new music from a new project:  Mike: vocals+precussion TC: Guitar+vocals TimShaw(tm): Guitar+Vocals Eric: Bass+Vocals  The Board of Trustees.    We're hoping to jam soon, although we already have a few songs started.  It's an Emo/alternative sound, should rock.  I'm hoping for some awesome acoustic sounds, and for some 4-part harmonies.    Keep watching the blog!

       OY THE AGONY! sigh... summer school sucks...terrible...hoy...i've been so overly busy with school and having to help out with a play. No Time! its summer man i need time. soon time will be here. god i hope. lately there have been no songs in my head, just random ideas. hell=writers block. i cant focus cause i have too much to do. i need to be like full-time musician so i can take time to work on this stuff. i dont wanna write crap, so i have to spend time. really what i have to do is get rid of this writeres block. im taking a break on writing for now, just listening to other bands i havent listened to in a long time...Green Day{new cd sept 21!!}, Boxcar Racer, Weezer, The Starting Line, Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters. i need ides just  so my brain can breath. ive been sorta pressured on a new idea of a song with someone not from P9. he and i have thought of a good idea for a song "Brace for the Impact" it's good but i cant write now...sigh...i should get out of this soon. in the mean time we are almost done with Acoustyx. YAY. so far the songs are Capo3, Their Last Dance, Two Years, Can't Get it Right, a song by me{has no name}, another one of mikes songs {no name}. two years is gonna kick it man. the old version was awesome but this will be good too. Two years is sorta p9/advance time...so if ur a hardcore P9 fan than you'll know that song...i dont think any of those exsist though, hmmm. so anyways im attempting to write. thats the basic update...the real studio or whatever is going to be set up soon. yay...that'll take 2 days about to get it perfect, i gotta buy some stuff and things {yes specific} to help with recording...and actually we dont have a producer yet. we cant get a old of him. were still searchin but thats ok we have time...but if you must know...{u must} they will be helping on the fulllength due out this fall. gonna help us with our sound, recording and stuff. im out for now. ill be back when i know more...and hell people REPLY! what do you think this thing is for...haha no worries...

       Hiya, not much updating to do. im not sure what to say. working on rearanging this "studio" so it's easier for the prerecordings. we didnt get that great of an income of ideas from people about the new title of an album. prolly cause like 2 people actually check this...very sad...Mike and i have streamed a lot of cool ideas, and we're working on them. and once the new prerecordings of the new songs are done ill put some up at www.Purevolume.com . ummmm, oo im checking up on less avenged design. looking at their ideas for some new art. we're working on a lot. oh i know what to say. robert and i are setting up a tour. so far we have october dates planned the 1-3. opening and other stuff. idk. but thats it for now...peace

      Hey all.  I survived school today... :5.  Not a bad day.  Lorenzo's oil was sad...  Very Depressing.  But anyways, My dad was cool today... He brought me a CD burner from work! It was black, and really new.  Unfortunately, it's a 24x10x40.  Ya... So he's going to take the slower one (for his PII box) and he's going to help we paint the faceplate  of mine.  YAY!  So dance practice today for Havana... its such a spiffy dance.  I get to dance with Xtine...  Heh.. She kept forgetting the dance and I had to remind her... Good Times.  Well, that's really about it today.  I'm on the phone with K, so its all good.  :5  Ummmm... Can't really think about anything else. See y'all later!

And I figured out what was wrong with my animated Gifs.  Huzzah.  Umm...  Not really a lot to say... Godspell is finishing up this weekend, and Guys and Dolls is almost here...

Because while I recline at home, you are off at school!  It's fourth hour right now...  I'm missing lunch with the table.  Oh, everybody tell Amy Veto happy birthday.  She's 16.  I think Kristin was getting worried about me this morning... After I left during math.  I hope somebody tells her where I am... I miss her.  NO SWIMMING FOR ME TODAY!! YAY!  Hah... Not like I was going to swim anyways...  But I do miss the speaker guy and Lorenzo's Oil... Ah well, sacrifices must be made in the name of good health.  I'll miss a dance rehearsal after school...  That's no fun.  Hopefully I can make this evening though... Kristin don't worry...

      Aight, I know song lyrics aren't really  real  entries, but I just had to put these in:  You Make Me, Me - MxPx   Every night I get down on my knees and pray And thank the Lord above for  you each day I was lost and then I found you You make my ocean, you make my sky blue  You make me smile You make me sing You make me scream You make me everything You make me, me  What blessings has the Lord  stored up for me You are the answer to that mystery I was lost and then I found you You make my ocean, you make my sky blue  You make me smile You make me sing You make me scream You make me everything You make me laugh You make me cry You make me live You make me die You make me, me  Height won't separate us from this love Depth can't separate  from this love  These days so few seem  to have faith In the son of man and in  his grace I feel your breath upon my face As you replace, my broken wings   And a bit from You're Not Alone (also MxPx)   Read your book while I make some hot tea I love it when you fall asleep on me I'm still me and I know you're still you Together we're in shock, together this is new   I couldn't resist...  I was listening to the new  urlLink MxPx  CD and came upon these lyrics... They are so me.  :5 Yeah, I'm still angry at the parents, but one cannot simply end daily practices without stopping life, so a huge protest has not been enacted.  Although, a small one continues:  I have attached a link to the website for my mp3 player... To every email I send (I send them both emails frequently), and I have begun to wear my CD player whenever I am at home and not eating dinner.  :5  muahaha...  Not really.  But hey, I can dream, can't I?  Oh, BTW, don't go to AMC if you can, they fired a friend of mine's brother simply because his boss didn't like him... And they've tried to do it before.  Yeah, just thought I'd share that.  that's all for now... Musical's coming up :5  Oh, and I know it's amazing, but I can dance!  Well... Sort-of... 'Night

      I suppose I should take my own advice and look on the bright side.  I have clean clothes, and the P9 CD is almost ready.  All we have to do is burn and copy it.  My bike's not broken, we change seats in Math soon, Swimming is almost over, I didn't have much homework over break, it's raining (or at least it was), Flags got 3rd at state, Kristin and TimShaw are both home safely, The new  urlLink P9 website  layout is posted, my music (which will remain un-portable until I can get a credit card) is choosing to play in a good order,   KTO is giving me some computer stuff.  I still have to take my A+ Core test...

      For some reason, my parents think I'm a little jerk that walks around the house demanding things from them all the time.  The first problem with that is such:  I'm never upstairs longer the a half hour, except for meals.  How can I possibly piss them off that much in that short of a time?  I'm either down in the basement or out of the house!  It's not like I ditch chores, either.  When the fam went to Eastern, I did all of the stuff my mom wanted me to do... Even more.  And at church this morning, my mom was talking about how the upstairs bathroom needed cleaning.  I volunteered to do it, but she did it anyways.  You all probably know of my strong desire for an MP3 player, right?  Well, I've found one that I wish to purchase.  I have the cash, I'm ready to pay for the whole thing, but they won't let me buy it.  They claim that I don't need everything the minute it comes out.  The minute it comes out?!? The last thing I had the minute it came out was the RelientK CD... And my mom fought with me about it.  I still don't know why.  So back to the mp3 player... I said to my mom "There's something at buy.com that I want to buy, can I use your credit card to order it?"  and she said "what is it" and I said "Something for me, an mp3 player I've been wanting.  I have the money."  and then she told me no, because I didn't need it.  Yet this morning, at lunch, she told my sister that "your money is yours, do what you want with it."  WHAT WAS THAT?!?  I am steaming... I wish I had a credit card.  Alright, I will admit that my constant online shopping (actually, online looking-at-computer-stuff-and-never-buying-it) can get annoying, but it's not like I have the money to buy any of it, nor do I have the intent.  It's all stuff I like to dream about.  I mean, there are very few things that I actually follow through with.  I'm trying to think of my online purchases... Or just big purchases.  Well, my computer, my drum set, my video card, and my RAM.  That's about it... And I paid  every cent  of those things.  Well, except for the drum set, but I had the money to pay for it, and my parents volunteered $100.  Still not sure why, they always complain about it.  This just angers me to no end how they act like I'm a little snob.  This is what we call "not appreciating your children."  These people will yell at me for any reason they can think of.  Now I know that I am an especially annoying person, but even I don't annoy myself that much.  Its not that they're bad parents, not at all, but they are so easily aggravated... ALWAYS!  My mom, for some reason  HATES  the band, I don't know why.  You can read in one of my earlier posts what she said.  It's like... Way to go mom, you're so encouraging me by telling me that my band SUCKS and the NOBODY LIKES US.  Great vote of confidence there...  I feel the love.  And my dad gets so pissed off at me every time I mention something new I found out in the computer world.  A few Sundays ago, I was flipping through a BestBuy ad, and I saw a digital camera, and I said "Hey dad, check this out, a 6.3 Megapixel digital camera, I thought they only got up to 5.  That's cool."  And he blew up at me, yelling at me about wanting everything.  The words "I want" didn't appear once... And I said nothing about our old digital.  Oh, and then today after church/lunch:  I got home, and Kristin called.  [BTW, Starlites got 3rd at state! YAY!] So I talked to her for a bit, until she had to go.  Then I had to call KTO about the stuff she has for me.  Then K called again, and my dad comes down and freaking yells at me to get off the "d**n phone."  Now, my mom spends, on average, 4-6 hours a day on the phone, with the SAME PERSON!  I just love it when I'm supposed to call for a ride home from school, and the line is busy... For a half-hour.  And they still have the nerve to yell at me.  Know what's funny?  They always ask why I never spend time with them or my family, or have my friends over here.  Gee, I wonder?  Maybe its because I GET IN TROUBLE FOR  EVERYTHING!   I figure, the less I'm at home, or in sight, the less I get in trouble.  That's why I'm always in the basement or out of the house.  I can't believe them sometimes.  The things they do... Oh, so one night, my parents volunteered me for a babysitting job, which was going to be until late, around 2 AM.  I had asked before I went over to the house if I had to get up for church the next morning.  The answer was 'probably not', or something along those lines.  And yet, the next morning, I had to get up at 7.  Despite the fact that I was out until 2 because my mom volunteered ma, I still got in trouble when I told them that they said that I could stay home.  Hmm...  Then they did it to my sister just today.  Although, she was out of her own free will (no matter that she was 2 hours after curfew).  Oh, then there's the time that they made me quit fall play because of a puppet thing, then made me quit puppets.  And just now, I was trying to defend my point and I got grounded for two or three weeks.  Not that it matters, you see.  Also, don't bother calling for the next few days, they won't let me use the phone.  But they completely forgot the I have a phone on my desk.  Hm... I think I may hide a spare PC away somewhere if they ever try to rob me of mine.  I should delete my dad's account and password games... Remind me to do that.  And also just now:  they're going to Home Depot to get some stuff and my mom says "lets take him along and cheer him up." and I said "you won't cheer me up."  and they freaked out at me, especially when I said that I didn't want to go because I'd probably do something else stupid and get in trouble.  And my dad freaking yelled at me.  WHAT THE FREAKING HECK?!?  Oh, and they said a definite "no" to my mp3 player... My mom, after she vetoed it, asked "how much of it would I have to pay?" I said none.  My dad freaked out, as he usually does when I bring up some new piece of technology.  I seriously think that he's jealous of my computer...  I even stopped mentioning what I do with it, except for my webpages.  I swear, someday I'm going to come down here and find it missing.  I like how he won't let me upgrade it anymore.  I mean, we have 8 computers, can't he just leave mine alone?  I only have two, and one's a piece of crap... Sort-of.  I'm just sick of being criticized for everything I do or say.  They won't even let me defend my point.  What, do they want me to lie down and let everyone trample on me for the rest of my life?  I think they don't let me defend because they know I can defeat their logic.  I have several times, and they know it.  I did tonight, I made all of my mom's petty reasons for not letting me purchase it look like nothing.  I even showed her how she could use it, I showed how I could use it for school.  And in the end, they said "you don't need another thing for music."  another?  Huh? Am I missing a few things here?  Oh, the best part?  My mom wondered why I didn't just put my 2- or 3- MB projects on CDs.  I told her that it was a waste of a CD to put a 2 meg presentation onto it, and that it is hard to use e-mail to get my projects to school.  She inquired how much a CD cost.  My dad said $1.  Uhh... No?  CD's are cheap to free.  I then computed that the 30gig player could hold the equivalent of about 44 CDs.  My mom replied "then use CDs, they're cheaper.  Uh... Mom?  I can't fit 771 songs onto a CD, and I can't reuse CDs all I want.  I don't understand these people.  When they get like this, I usually go play my drums.  Really loud.  I could go on for longer with this rant, but I'm already at two pages... actually, two and a little more.  woohoo. All I can say is that I hope they'll start being nicer, and that I want a credit card. Kristin... I need you here with me

      Wow... I was sitting at my desk flipping through a  urlLink TigerDirect  catalogue while my comp was doing a virus check, and I glanced up at the picture of Kristin that I have.  I am one lucky guy... There is no way I deserve a girl like her.  She deserves so much more than me...  Although, I'm glad she think's I'm worthy. :5  She puts up with me and my random thoughts, and my immense geekyness.  She deals with my inept dating techniques, and she doesn't *seem* to care that half my friends are other girls...  She's always so happy when we (meTSTC) show up at her house.  I love this girl...  See, I can write this now and flatter her while she's at state.  :5.  I'm so sneaky... Or at least I like to think I am.   Yeah, this blog was another random thought.  I love having this thing that I can randomly post on.  I am so going to fill this thing...

      Random thought:  I hate how we have to put little disclaimers on things when we write them.  People are so quick to take offense (no Xtine, this isn't all you, there are many others) to anything.  See, look.  I just had to put a disclaimer On the other hand, perhaps disclaimers like that are good.  They cause us to pause and think about what we write.  Sometimes when people are on rants, they need to just calm down for a second, and the little disclaimer helps them do that.  My Disclaimer (irony is a killer, eh?) - don't be angry at me because of this post.  As in all my posts, this one is not aimed at any one person, it is rather an idea.  This journal is a chance for you to get a look at my mind.  If I intend to rant about any one person, I will use their name :5.

      Blagh.  My mom is being not cool at all.  So P9  has been recording/practicing all week, like we have planned to.  And today I'm all ready to go, and she says that I'm supposed to watch Ethan... Umm.. No?  So now shes pissed and claims that I'm not allowed to practice over the summer.  Hah... she's funny, isn't she.  I bet she'll forget by next week.  If that long.  But thats not the half of it.  Earlier this week, I was telling her "we're going to be recording over break"  and she said "for what?" and I replied "To get our name out and maybe get into SHOcase"  and she told me that nobody would want to hear us.  Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence.

As for the rest of her accusations, they're true.  I won't hide that anymore, I was stupid.  Out of line and emotionless.  I only just realized how much I was hurting my friends when the escapade with Steph happened.  I've asked my friends for help to fix this in myself, and I've apologized and asked for forgiveness.  I'm not going to say anything against what she wrote there, its all true.  I want you all to go read it, then you can know what I've done.  I don't know when I changed into such a jerk, I really don't.  I hate this new me, I hate it.  You have no idea how much I hate hurting people, and how much I've prayed for God to help me get out of this rut.  I want out.  If anyone still has any respect for me after reading that, please help me.  what a great end to this day.

      Well, I was just checking up on all my friend's blogs, and I had a few odd thoughts.  What is it about human nature that draws us to a point where pain is unavoidable?  People develop crushes on the one person they cannot have.  Others cannot handle themselves when tough times arise.  I know that I'm going to get criticized for saying these things, but they're the truth.  I cannot fathom how one can simply shut off other people when things don't turn out right.  Anger and hurt are understandable, but isolation is not the answer for most...  It just frustrates me how I cannot understand my own feelings, let alone others feelings.  God works in mysterious ways, I guess.  Have you ever wondered that?  What God has in store, why he does certain things?  It just confuses me to no end how some things will work for good.  But they have, I've seen things with my own eyes that prove this true.  Back to the topic of people:  I don't want to go back to Godspell, there is too much stuff going on there.  I mean, I love the cast, all of them, they're awesome.  But these situations they've put themselves into are just tearing us apart.  At least the last show is coming up soon.  April 4... Then it can end.  But I'm just kidding myself there, it won't end with the show.  They'll continue to bicker and fight.  I can't stand it... One wrong comment and someone's not talking to me.  But, you know, its so awesome to be reading someone's journal and see hope.  I mean, its the awesomest thing.  To see all these people complaining and acting depressed, then have one person put out a glimmer of hope in the midst of it all.  We all make mistakes, and we all have to forgive.  Nobody's perfect, and we all have to realize that.  Another thing I cannot understand:  Uncontrollable anger.  Why do people blow up?  I have felt the anger bubble up inside me, and I feel the rage trying to come out, but I simply don't let it.  I just don't understand it sometimes. I can't wait 'till Guys and Dolls.  I hope we can pull it together.

      Good Youth group, although it was quite ironic.  We talked about revenge.  Its funny how God can give you a push in the right direction when you need it.  Did you know that holding hate or revenge in your mind can make you physically ill?  Things like worry, anger, hate, they trigger some chemical that stops the body from producing antibodies to fight disease.  So, it turns out that being laid-back is healthier.  I never really knew that before.  Kinda cool, if you think about it.  I mean, you let your anger go,  and  you get to be healthier!  Its a win-win situation.  I promise you, this is what we talked about.. It was so odd that this would come up today, of all days.  But yeah.  Well, I can't go to the lock-in at church because I have contest and a softball game (hopefully...) to go to on Saturday, but that gives me all Friday night to play BF:1942...

      Hm... What to say in this post?  First: Awesome closing show, it was awesome.  The memories of these Seniors will be good ones, although the mood after was marred by an unfortunate event.  Hm.  People suck, really.  Haha... Aren't I just so encouraging?  Yes, I know :5.  But really, tonight's show was awesome.  I am really going to miss this cast.  Well, all of them except the kleptomaniac.  Memories Marred.  Sounds like an interesting song title, or a poem.  It?s kinda close to Misplaced Memories (which is a song by MxPx).  So Mortonson won his bet.  I was the first to pay him off.  $1 in quarters, although I still find it hard to believe that he was nice to everyone for 5 hours.  Nevertheless, he was.  I was just thinking about losing my seniors, but then I remembered: we still have Sandusky.  Well, most of us.  Ah well.  I hope contact will be kept among this cast.  I've met some truly talented people that I'm going to miss.  Well, its 2.15, so I probably shouldn't reflect upon my seniors at this hour :5.  On a completely random tangent:  I hate the way I am.  If anyone could see my mind they'd hate me.  I am not fond of myself, really.  My tendencies and habits annoy me.  I can tell that I annoy the people around me also, or maybe it?s just the paranoia.  Who Knows?  I hate the flow of emotion after a show, the constant fatigue, the sleepless nights, spent thinking about nothing.  Know what?  The nice thing about this blog is that I can rant about myself because nobody reads it anyways.  I may very well be the only one.  Now, of course you cannot be brought to guilt if you?re not reading this, so why should I apologize for that statement?  Hmmm?  Sorry for this state of delirium.  iTunes is choosing mellow songs at the moment.  Sometimes I swear that thing is reading my mind.  Again, I'm star-struck (reference to the poem).  Is it wrong to hold something against someone if they associate closely with someone you do not trust, do not respect?  In essence, is it wrong to throw the star away for becoming closer to the darkness?  I wonder.  My mind comes up with the oddest things, but very few of the ideas are at all meaningful.  Well, thats enough rant for tonight.  I don't want to give away exactly what I'm feeling, because that could be dangerous.  Explosive even.  But These true feelings shall be kept for me, and only me to think about later.   This is not  urlLink Henry S. Bryan  telling you to only think when it is safe to.

      Hmmm... Good show tonight!  And a good cast party @ Applebees.  But, as pertaining to my tradition, I have penned a poem.  It's actually not sad, or angry.  A bit melancholy if I may, but it has a good tone overall.  Oh, and by the way, don't read anything into it.  When inspiration strikes, you cannot alter its course.  This poem was composed with a sleep-deprived and adrenaline-pumped mind.  Hurray for random Inspiration!  Why does the light draw itself to the darkness, The glittering star loses itself in the night. Just out of reach, kept away on a whim, I am not allowed, I cannot hold the star.  Although I have a light of my own, My eyes are eclipsed by a star just as bright But still I am held, by the pull of my star. Tho' in my dreams I am warmed by the light Of the spark'ling star, as it dances in my mind: Fading in and out of my grasp,  I feel as though I disturb the star,  In it's glorious orbit about its own world,  For its world only touches mine in one place A tiny instance in the Grand scheme Shine, Shine without me  Hm...  It seems a bit proper for me.  I usually have a slightly more casual tone to my poems.  Who knows... This one was kind-of inspired by a few things.  After reflecting upon this.. The song "Out of My League" by Stephen Speaks comes up in a smoky memory.  Hm.  Much to think about, however thinking is dangerous at this hour.  I really don't know what it is that I'm feeling, although I know that it is skewed greatly by the musical and lack of sleep.  But still, creating these soap-operas in my mind keeps me awake.  They're things that I know will never come true, and things that sometimes even I don't want, but it is still enjoyable to speculate the outcomes of various situations.  Especially with my less-than-substantial knowledge of most people's mannerisms.  Ah well.  "For all that may come true, we must continue to hope, to hope for something new, something better, something perfect, or else all that is human is lost."  Its fun to put my delirium into quotes like that to make people think that I'm quoting someone. :5  This is not  urlLink Cat Stevens  reminding you to brush your teeth.

      Hey All Musical ended somewhat early, so I'm blogging.  It was actually pretty good tonight, despite the fact that we had to do act 2 again.  No matter.  It's gonna be one rockin' show, so get your tickets before its too late!  On another note:  I really shouldn't read other people's journals before blogging in mine... They affect my mood.  Hm.  Not doing my math homework tonight.  Maybe tomorrow before the show.   Maybe.   Hm... I hate to comment on other's lives, I mean, its none of my business, aye?  Mine's kinda boring.  Actually, my mine id quite convoluted and scheming, but I could never pen that here.  Goodness, I'd have no friends.  I just thank God that I have the self control to contain most of it.  Xtine knows what I mean when I say most.  I have my personality traits.  Honestly, I annoy myself.  If I were not me, and someone else were, I would probably not be friends with myself (did that make sense?).  I dunno.  I've been being odd lately.  I think it comes with the lack-of sleep.  I've been sketching more... What am I sketching?  Go look at my sketches in Pictures... Yeah, that.  Its odd, I must admit.  I guess I can scan the new stuff I've drawn, not that I really believe anyone looks around here.  That's ok though.    Well, If ever you need someone to talk to, lemmie know.  I'll give it a shot.  I need some poetry...  Something to either counter or blend with the melancholy feelings of nearly all teens.  Hm. It seems like such a waste, all these hurt feelings.  Now, mind you, that is not to say that one should not have them, for I mean no offense in that manner. But all this anguish and hurt that distracts us from what is required of us, both socially and academically, is so painful to us, simply because it is added to social pressures form all sides.  I know that there is no solution to this dilemma, and that as long as there is love there will be at least one  broken heart.  Love is unpredictable, and wonderful.  But when it consumes every part of you, it is hard to move.  There always has to be that small port back to the real world.  The euphoria that accompanies the feelings is unforgettable.  Hm... These are seemingly random thoughts.  Maybe its because I'm tired.  This is not  urlLink Thomas Watson Sr. , reminding you to have a positive outlook on things!

      Alright: Here's how it goes.  A few of you know about my doctrine :5.  Come now, you know: guys, at least in high school, aren't worth crying over.  We're just jerks sometimes.  Its nothing we can really stop, it is just kind of how we work... That part's a little shaky.  But anyways, I know so many couples blown apart by misunderstandings and ill-fated responses.  Now I do not meant to say the guys are the only ones that are jerks, because girls can be brutal.  But you see, nothing can get better until someone tries to make it better.  Now, I'm not saying that you have to date the person again, or even be a close friend, but at least get to a point where you aren't mad.  It'll hurt more if you hold your grudges.  Remember TimShaw's line:  "therefore, he who abuses his brother will pay for it in the courts, but he who sneers at his brother will answer for it in the fires of hell..." Or something like that.  This much is true:  If you do not forgive, you shall never be forgiven, and pain and suffering shall be yours.  Just a nice little reminder.

      Hmmm... What to say?  I'm not really sure what can be said...  Well, we can start with "Happy Birthday KTO!" How can one sum up the 7-month run of a show in a mere blog?  I guess I don't really have to.  Although that show is over, the promise of next year's project gleams in the distance like a dream.  I can't wait... Although I will miss Lance... This cast has not been a cast that simply acted together, but a cast of friends.  Sure, we all had our falling-outs with each other, but in the end, truly everyone (well, nearly everyone) was a friend to [nearly] everyone else.  The soap operas then seem so funny to us now... It's crazy how many crushes developed within that cast.  Let's see... I count... 3 for myself.  You know, this is going to be hard.  My song... I love that song, it was great to sing, I had so much fun with it.  And now that I think about it, I never have to stop singing it.  Every time we party, the memories will come alive again.   I guess it must be quite a thing to be mentioned by a Catholic priest on a Palm Sunday mass, but these 15 amazing kids (actually more like 20 or so, counting the band and crew) did it!  But, we never could have if God hadn't been with us.  *spend moment thanking God for awesome show*  There, don't you feel better?  I know that hatred and hurt feelings seemed rampant sometimes, but after the fog cleared everything was ok.  I love everyone in that show, and everyone involved.  I really should stop, before I make myself start tearing up... Ah well.  Time to put back my chain, and my bright red shirt (although I'm going to find a way to fit that chain in next year, I know it) Goodnight, all  I'll see you from the stage next year.  The hope: I'll never forget all the things that were said The closeness we had, the love that we spread The end will never truly be here Unless we let the memories die Together we'll charge toward our next crusade up on stage, in the lights, till another is saved Together we'll do it, together we'll stand So long as we stay together as friends We can o'ercome any obstacle, cross any bridge And by next year we'll be here, stronger again The hope of a new show gleams off in the distance Like a star in the sky on a summer eve How I'll miss it, I will, 'till another is here but then, even then, the memories will never die.   :5

I love all this rain, it makes me happy.  How ironic... The rain stopped at about 2.00PM today... Maybe a little before.  *shudder* Well, I still haven't eaten lunch, but dinner is in a few minutes, so that should be good.  I need to do my laundry and my English, and I'm really tired... And my mom won't let me go anywhere tonight.  I have to mow tomorrow if it's dry, and I'm going to try to get my mind off her for a bit.   In other news, the world is no longer in a paradox...  TS and I are single, and TC and Eric are taken.  Back to the way it was before... How strange.  Well, now that I no longer have to censor myself, You're going to see some crazy poetry coming out of this... But I have yet to feel anything... Maybe it won't be the breakup, but what comes after.  And I don't know what comes after.  But I'm pretty sure I'm going to find out. The horizon is bright, and the air is cool and damp.  The fading sun warms my face as I prepare for the next big adventure life has for me...  On this neverending highway.  I know now that I can take anything the world throws at me.  Well, God and I can.  I need not be depressed, but hopeful and trusting that God will get me out.  Because I know he will. Well, I'm sick of moping so I'm going to look on the bright side... And I don't care who hates me for it.  I'm going to laugh and smile like I did before, this can't weigh on me.  I know I can move past it, I am strong.  Once I sleep and get some food in me, I think I'll be just fine.  Just fine.  God, please help me through this...

      Well, you'll all find out anyways... Its done.  I know I'll never forget the 5 months...  It was terribly ironic... The last call was still silence, well, silence with my attempts at explaining interspersed... I feel terrible.  I wonder how long she'll hate me... I hope its not long.  She is still an awesome girl... But not the one for me.  I'm sorry... Really I am.  The funny thing is... I was the one crying on the phone, not her.  Not that I blame her, I'm not worth her tears.  I wish I could act hurt, but I can't.  I know it was my fault, and I didn't want it to end like it did... But once a rock starts rolling, it crushes everything.  And I was the one who pushed it... And got hit by it.  So I screwed up... Again.   I'm going to miss you, Kristin. I'll never forget those 5 months...   Run me through... And leave me there with the sword still in my heart. Please don't hate me... You've still got a place in my heart...  I know you'll hate me for a long time... But when you no longer feel the anger, come on over and we can talk.

      Haha.. well, call us freaks, but TC and I have perfected the 'grading scale' for girls.  Now just wait, don't get mad yet. Instead of using the dated technique of a simply 1-10 scale, we have created a new methoud that takes three categories into account.  The three catagories are:  Physical Attractiveness, Personality, Attainability (would she date you).  The first two catagories are on scales of 1-10, 10 being highest.  Attainability is a 0 or 1, 1 being yes, 0 being no.  For example, a mildly attractive girl with lots of personality and a boyfriend would rate 6.8.0 on this scale.  An amazingly hot girl with absolutly no personality and no boy friend would rate 9.1.1.  Get it?  We were pretty bored...  Alright, if you're still offended, you can be mad now.  :5  Im a loser, aye?

      M$ (Microsoft) , How I loathe Thee. Your products suck, and break only when I need them. All I want is a simple function A simple task done Please, just let me get my homework done Come on... Install the feature, I know you can do it The equation editor... Is it so much to ask? Productivity suite?

      Trapped:  I can't get away The flood of emotions coming back Pushing me into the corner The dangerous thoughts, the deadly ideas Holding me down, hands tight around my throat I can't live a lie, make this up every day But things are so turned around, upside down, I don't know what to say, what's the right way I want to push out, but nobody hears my shout I can't hold on much longer, someone tough, someone stronger Carry me away from this place every day I live this lie, I have to live, I cannot die It means so much to see this thing that?s poisoning me I have to stay away, but the force pulls me       Closer...             Closer...                   Closer... To my sin, my head starts to spin Around and around, the ideas tumble Growing bigger, filling my mind, I can't hold on Pulling me away from where I am I don't know which is right, to stay right here, or to let go And fly to the other side,  Let the storms rage behind me, part of me no longer cares what is right I want my ideals, I want what I think is right Where is my calmer, the soother of my soul? Please God, please just tell me which is the way to go The ship parting quickly, with the greatest appeal, I've dreamed of that ship many a time Or should I stay here in the place I've been accepted On the port, safe on land, taking ne'er a chance?  The churning emotions smother my mouth, choking me out I cannot breathe, I can't hold on, everything is gone if I let go I pray for strength, and guidance too, but nothing clear comes through It seems every thing that I do pulls me back to this place Where I am forced to think, to go over and over in my mind What can I do, I can't just sit here forever... Lord, please help me out, send an angel to guide me I don't know where to go, and the water's rising fast,  My time's running out and these chains still bind me Trapped in my accursed thinking, my idealistic ideas I can't escape from the thoughts and the fears I am to weak, to scared, to confused God, clear my mind, help me make this decision The water is rising, my death is near       Higher...             Higher...                   Higher... Choking me out, my eyes going black The water fills my lungs and with my last dying breath I cry out...         --Mike Banducci              26 May 2004

      I'm still hyped up from the trip... My mind keeps dosing off and traveling to the top of Dragster...  I could barely stay awake in English today...  I'm so tired.  I would be in bed, but I needed to blog.  I hate blogging when I'm tired, all the deep feelings the I hide are brought to the surface and magnified.  But that's not the point.  TS and I were scaring the incoming Freshmen... It was so much fun.  It was good to get out of my little circle and talk to random people who were afraid of me! :5  It was a blast trying to recruit people...  And I had lots of stickers on.  I want to join math Team next year... but its on Thursdays and Noah is one of the coaches... I dunno, maybe I can deal with him... but It could conflict with speech.  Had a great mock fight with JeffJet... Good Times.  Well, today wasn't terrible, not even bad.  I realized that there are a few people that I can't make it through the day without...  And some of them surprised me...  I don't want to name them all, so as not to hurt feelings...  But Rosie always makes my day better... and Amy Veto always says hi to me on the bus...  And I  have  to have at least one hug from Kristin... The list goes on...  I love you all.    In other news, I am really tired... and the brass+rock bands from the '60s and '70s are the best.. I've been stuck on Chicago since Saturday.  Well, them and Blood, Sweat and Tears.  I love the sound...  I need a band like them too.  Hm... Moody Blues+Chicago+BST+MxPx+AudioA= ...what?  I wish I knew.  No, not Ska... I dislike Ska...  So No dressing in gymn tomorrow, YAY!  and We're watching (another) movie in English.  So cool.  Man, I just can't forget that huge thrill at the top.  I was so high above the world for a split-second... then I came back.  I want to stay up there.. away from everything.  I want to lie there and watch the world below, watch the fickle people run about trying to make their fortunes...  I want to see from God's perspective.  I want to fly.  and I need to sleep. This is not  urlLink Chicago , telling you to rock out!

      Oh man.... That was the most fun I've ever had!  Just got back about 45 minutes ago...  So much fun...  I'm still Hyper.  ::Day One:: Friday, May 21, 2004 Long bus ride, but fun nonetheless.  Watched a movie or two, I'm not sure which ones.  This was pretty much the only time I had on this trip to think about... Well... The depressing topic.  I wrote two poems, they'll be at the bottom of this one, ok?  Oh, Eric and I did some Character Bios, just some basic info on three of them... I'll put those on the  urlLink Musical Blog  when I'm done here.  JoeMac, Ryan Eric and I went to bed around 12.30.  Oh, I almost forgot...  We played the best Prank... Our room minus Joe...  Well:  We had these really nice rooms... With a Mini-fridge and a microwave, and a balcony overlooking the lake!  We were on the third floor, and the room below us was a room of girls from SHS... Not sure who they all were...  But we were saying hello through the slats in the deck and Eric made some sort of reference to 'Taking a leak' on the balcony.  So I ran and got a cup of lukewarm water...  And Mortonson was telling me to pour it... So I did :5  The girls started screaming and swearing, then they got yelled at by the security guard... Amazing fun. :5x400  ::Day Two:: Saturday, May 22, 2004 Got up around 6.30... Dressed, and ate.  Then we took a walk out on the boardwalk outside the hotel.  Piled onto the busses at about 7.30 and left for the High School where we performed.  We rocked it up on 'Somewhere'...  It was amazing, and totally deserving of 1st... Which is what we got.  That's right, SHS is the top AAA choir there!  YAY!!! (ooo... 3!)... But we didn't know that until the middle of the day, so lets go back.  Well, we got to  urlLink Cedar Point  and I was freaked out by the size of the 'Coasters...   urlLink Christy  was an excellent guide... I rode my first rollercoaster that morning.  Raptor was my first sampling of  urlLink what the park had to offer .  Yeah, I went on all three of the rides on that page, and a whole lot more!  It had to have been the best day of my life so far... And I managed to keep the depressing-ness out of my mind!  It was so cool.  When we (Christy, Mortonson, Eric, Emi, Cheryl, and several others I didn't know) went on Magnum, I was on the left side of the car, meaning that when we went up the huge hill, I couldn't see anything holding me up... It was so scary.  We went on a lot of stuff... Magnum Twice, Raptor, Gemini (I did both cars once), The Mine Train, Iron Dragon,  urlLink Dragster , and  urlLink Millennium Force .  It was simply amazing... And totally worth the wait in line.  Ryan and I were 'coaster buddies' for Dragster... We were so scared at the beginning...  But it was so much fun.  The anticipation was so cool...  So you pull up to the line and sit for about 20 seconds... Then the lights come on... yellow.yellow.yellow.GREEN!  Off like a shot, 120MPH in under 4 seconds... Then, before you know it, you're going straight up.  We did it at night, so it looked like we were going up into nothingness...  Then once you get up to the top, there's a tiny pause, just enough for you to look down, and what a view.  That is the only point that you realize how high you are.  Then after less than a second, its a free fall and a 270-degree corkscrew, then its over!  It was the biggest rush in the world...  Our car was the second-to-last car to go, then the ride died... I felt bad for the people in out group who didn't make it...  Oh, before that, and after getting out 1st place trophy, most of the choir went on the bumpercars...  That was fun.  After I figured out how to drive, I rammed Stephanie Forrest, then I went to pick on KJ and Mortonson.  Great fun...  Well, we were late for the bus because Dragster got stuck and we were waiting for the rest of our group to come.  Then, just as the park was closing, the rain started.  I couldn't have asked for a better day.  We got back to the hotel and ordered a pizza, then crashed.  ::Day Three:: May 23, 2004 We got up around 6.15 and ate breakfast, then packed up our room.  We left for the  urlLink Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  at 8.30.  That place was simply amazing... I didn't have time to take it all in.  Ah, Steph Forrest caught a typo on one of the display signs... It was awesome. :5  I hung out with Morgan, and we had a blast.  I was mere inches away from one of Eric Clapton's guitars!!  We saw a drumset the Green Day burned onstage...  It was so cool, all the stuff they had.  I got a shirt. :5  There are not words enough to describe that place... It was amazing...  All the stuff... Heh.  Then we had a nice long bus ride home, and here we are!  Amazing weekend!  And FIRST PLACE!!!  Poems:   Forbidden  I want her for my own my greatest dream come true I cant stand to see her with anyone else. To my jealous mind,  every move seems to have  some hidden motive. Trapped in the jealousy of my mind the love in my heart drown out in the torrent of suspicion I wish she could be mine but my hope is for naught I have built myself a barrier a wall to hold me in trapped by myself.    Why Bother?  You know, this shouldn't be allowed this lie of a life, This worthless existence why do I lie to myself, why do I hope for the impossible this wish of mine... It is worthless I, I am a liar, not fit for this grace, and yet I am shown great mercy the love I do not deserve I am not worthy of one word, one breath, one glance. I do not belong here with them these people who love me I know what I do to them I know they feel frustration of which I am the cause. Forgive me, my friends I do not belong.   Alright, as usual, don't worry about me, My poetry is almost always an exaggeration of my true feelings, its ok, really!  Alright, I'm out.  This is not  urlLink Intamin AG , telling you to live life up!  P.S.- Intamin AG built The two best coasters at Cedar Point.  :5

I'm just so... No, not happy, but I'm... I'm awesome.  I haven't been awesome in a long time... Not truly awesome.  I feel like... I feel like I could take off and fly... If I weren't so tired.  That concert was amazing.  I keep thinking that I have to say goodbye to my seniors tonight... But I get to spend a weekend with them!  I still need to think of something to give them.  Hm.  But anyways, I still dread the end of this year, but I know that I'll never truly lose these people, they're just going away for a little bit.  Hm.  I just want to keep this, this amazing feeling.  A whirlwind of fantastic color, the memories in my mind.  I know that I'll have to say goodbye eventually... Which adds a touch of melancholy to this moment... But it is still awesome nonetheless.  The songs were awesome, and I only had two mess-ups in the powerpoint, which were ok.  Nothing too bad.  I hit the really high notes in Capitan... And Joe and Ryno ROCKED!  No, that deserves more "!"s... Ok... Joe and Ryno RAWKED!!!!!  That's better.  :5  Choraliers took Java Jive and turned it around, ant it was freaking AWESOME!  I never tthought I'd like that song... But it just sticks with you.  I wish I had known VanHook...  The stories I hear of him sound... Well... Interesting.  The way things were, and how so many of the traditions were started.  Traditions... I hope I know enough to keep them going.  Ah well.  I should go before I do some damage.

He looks in to her eyes, Hoping for something A dream come true,  Any sign of life. She just looks back, avoiding his stare,  the piercing gaze. And he can't take it one more time.  He can't find her,  he's lost his love. He can't find her,  He's lost again. and He doesn't know which way to turn And he's all alone without her  She looks from afar, trying to figure him out Why is she not the one? She sees him walk by  but she can't say a word the look in his eyes says it all.  She can't find him,  She's lost her love. She can't find him,  She's lost again. and He doesn't know what he does to her And She's all alone without him   Another rainy day another broken heart another chance for her to try to get it out she walks up slowly to the one she loves  Why can't she just get it out Why can't she tell him how she feels She's stuck and no one else can help her She's lost again.  The rain falls with her tears on the bench outside the school She doen't show her face The comfoting arm 'round her back telling her that its ok.  But She can't have him,  He's someone else's love. She can't find him,  She's lost again. and He doesn't know what he does to her And She's all alone without him  He's right there, holding her so tight agains him He knows he loves her too But he can't have her,  she's out of his league And so he's lost his love again  He can't find her,  She's out of his league. He can't find her,  He's lost again. and He doesn't know which way to turn And he's all alone without her  And he's all alone without her

      Hey all!  Blogger changed its look, so I changed mine.  Sorry I lost all your comments... I still have them somewhere... If I really need them.  All posts from now on will have comments on them, so comment away!  Yeah... So I think I may be writing an English paper connecting Othello's killing of Desdimona to the huge amount of domestic violence today.  Something like... 'What Shakespeare has touched on in the play 'Othello' is not something that is rare today.  Domestic violence, especially against women, is at it's highest in (x) years.  Another little known fact:  women are 5 times as likely to get attacked than men... blah."  This could be fun :5

To all you prommers out there:  I still expect pictures, and I hope last night was fun!  Sorry... I was playing StarCraft online so I don't have time for a real blog...

      Dang am I glad I have a superhero.  Yes, a personal superhero.  She's on-call 24/7/365, and she lives 3 minutes away by bike.  And she's a geek.  The added bonus:  She can put up with my OCD!!  Yeah, so I was feelin' pretty down today...  For reasons that will remain unknown to most of you... And then Rosie made me go to her house... So we hung out for what, 2 hours?  Yeah.  So I came back home... And now I'm fine.  That's why she's a superhero.  Although the situation isn't perfect again, its back to a normal running balance.  I can never be perfect, but why complain?  Heh... Yeah, so Rosie is the awesomest(est) person ever.  Thanks a ton! I will always love her, but as a friend and no more. And Kristin rocks... Even if she is a little communication challenged... I'm still trying to fix that.  Anyone want to help?

      People Suck.  I hate people.  Why, after having known about person A's 'family troubles' for two weeks, did we start singing a song that would cause that person to leave the room?  And why must we not sing the song simply because one person would be hurt?  Others in the group had suffered similar loss...  Yet they were perfectly able to sing the song in question?  Goodness, I'm glad McG doesn't read my blog, because I'm pissed.  These are my seniors graduating this year, and they're being reduced to 'Java Jive'  Where is the justice in that?  These seniors have worked so hard over the past four years... And then this.  One person.  With all due respect to her loss, she can leave the stage for all I care.  Its beautiful...  I'll put the text here:   Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there, I do not sleep.  I am a thousand winds that blow; I am the diamond glints on the snow.  I am the sunlight on ripened grain; I am the gentle autumn's rain.  When you awaken in the mornings hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight.  I am the soft star that shines at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there, I did not die.  --Author unknown   I can understand why it would upset her, but it is a beautiful song... One that these seniors deserve.  When McG asked us if it was ok, I knew that almost nobody agreed, but we wouldn't have won anyways.  I should have spoken up, but my opinion as a sophomore doesn't matter.  I can't believe any one man is that.... GAH!!  Nobody has motivation... I barely have any... I've half a mind to just leave, but I need to get in next year...  This is just crap...    I want to sing this song... And its not just me.  I can fully understand why we might not want to sing it, and I understand, as best I can, her loss and the devastation, but still.  Let her leave the stage, let her walk off.  I hate to be cold and heartless... But how can I not be?  I just... I... I hate this crap.  These people, that I respect are being reduced to JAVA JIVE!!  It's not even a GOOD SONG!  I mean, its bad enough doing only one song for the senior recognition concert, but this one SUCKS!  We could have at least replaced 'Requiem' with something else...  And there's the added bonus of not going out at all this holiday season (**** administration)  and the 'casting' for the musical... Nice way to rub salt in the wound.  I'm glad most of my seniors had a good year last year...  This just sucks.  Yes, I'm a jerk for 'disrespecting' her loss... But oh well.  I don't really care anymore.  Now I've got more to think over tonight.  After my nice little lack of sleep the past few nights...  I hate this.  Joe worked so hard to find this too.  I think that two things should happen: 1) We learn the song on our own and sing it anyways, and she can just leave if she so desires, and 2) that those that are angered by this decision should not show up on Monday after school.  We'll send McG some coffee (Thanks Joe!).  This sucks.  Well, if anyone was wondering about yesterday, it is somewhat resolved, although I cannot choose the path I would like...  It is not that it is too uncertain, but that I cannot hurt the people I love...  The person, really.  But That is for only me... And nothing you should be worried about.  So, in conclusion, I would like to tacke one last chance to say "screw this."  Motivation for 'Java Jive' is null, although I suspect I will still make a decent attempt, if only to honor my seniors.  I can't believe this.

      I really shouldn't be allowed to have a Blog, have Linkin Park, be tired, and have a mellow attitude all at the same time.  Something's eating at me... And I don't know why.  It shouldn't be, but it is.  I'm just tired... I hope.  I don't even know if what I heard was true! I haven't been able to verify it!  But if it is true... I don't know... [Don't you just love my cryptic entries?]  I don't know why it keeps coming back... Its just rolling over in my mind... Over and over.  Its not that I'm sad either... I just don't know what to think.  Its really messing with me.  Now please, don't be worried about me.  I'm not the type to do anything rash... But I can't always be the happy-go-lucky kid most of you know me as.  I don't know how I feel... I hope I'm better in the morning, really I do.  I should sleep.. But going to bed will bring no relief.  I can never fall asleep when I go to bed.  I always lay awake for a while.  That time is filled with thought... Often I'm either day-dreaming or rethinking something... I know what it will be tonight.   Why can't I just leave it?  It would make things so much easier... But that's how life is, I guess.  I've told people over and over that the only way to get past this type of thing is to want to...  I guess this means I really don't want to.  And I don't.  I have to, I am being forced.  I don't want to move past, I want things to go my way.  I am regretting things, but I'm not regretting them.  That was odd... I guess This is what I mean:  I am happy with the choice that I made, but I would consider both options again if I could go back.  Actually, I'm very happy with what I chose.  So why am I doing this to myself?  Somebody tell me.  Thanks.

      Good Day!! Yes, thats two (2) exclamation points! Thats how good it was!  It would have been three If I could have seen K today, but hey, you gotta take what you can get.  What was good today?  Lots.  Linux is back up and running!  I don't know why or how, but I got bored and threw the 6GB drive back into the CompUSA towear and it jumped to life.  Installed SuSE without a problem, and I got everything configured.  Downloaded AIM and Firefox, and did an update, and now its running great!  My dad brought home 2 new monitors a while ago, so I popped one of the 15" we had sitting over there onto a 'tabe' made from two crates and a sheet of wood, and now I'm using two comps at once!  Its so much fun... Also, last night I 'decorated' and cleaned.  Hung up some AutoShow posters and I cleaned up my huge piles of stuff.  Its awesomeness...  Oops... haven't done my chem homework yet... Ah well, tomorrow, I guess.  Anyways, back to today:  I mowed the lawn, and it wasn't too bad!  It was really long, and I had to bag it, but it really wasn't that much work.  Then I trimmed, edged, and started moving woodships.  It felt good to do something other that sit here in the basement and surf around.  Oh!! We have ducks nesting in our back yard!  Its so cool... I took some pictures, I'll throw 'em up here later.  I accadentally scared the mom duck while I was edging... she flew off to the pond on the oter side of my house.  I havent check on them since, but there are... 7 or 8 eggs in the nest.  Good times. Thats all for today, so I'll be seein y'all later.  This is not  urlLink Edwin Budding , telling you to keep your lawn looking nice!

Well Jenna, if that's how you want to play.  Do you know why there are so many acronyms for "Ford"?  Its because the Chevy owners have all that time to think of them.  You know, all that time they spend waiting for their cars to get out of the shop.  Yeah, that's right. :5 **EDIT** Goodness! Stop posting things that I will only later delete!

      Well.  Interesting night!  Very rockin' party.  Thankfully, I was able to pocket my anger, allowing me to have an awesome evening.  But, I meant 'pocket' literally, I composed two poems!  One on the back of a beer box, and the other on a napkin.  One: Kill this all, Kill me now I hate what you do I hate you for hating me Just get away, I can't stand you anymore Just get out of my life You hate me for loving you (that was the original, I'm adding on now) All the emotion I wanted Held in front of my face,  but you took it away Gave it to an innocent bystander The hate boils up, mixing with the love You pull away from me, its all my fault I take the blame for the way you treat me I guess I'm not good enough to have you you need someone better, is that it? I don't need you if that's how it is. But how can I say that? You are the only thing I need, the only love right now. Never before have I felt like this. You inspire happiness at a glance,  Unspeakable joy at a touch. But you cut me off, and I am to blame So should I cut myself off?   Make you suffer no more? One slice of the knife, and I could be gone Just like that, no regrets Is a death so tragic, if it is born out of love? Perhaps, and maybe it is more tragic If you never saw, never knew What I would do for you, anything You killed me with a glance One wrong look, you were with him You ignored me, shrank away at my voice What have I done to deserve your hate?  Two: You know what you do, Choose him over me. I see the spite in your eyes,  you do this to hurt me! You've figured it out,  I know you're not that stupid. You let him have you,  I see you, in his arms. You do it just to kill me,  each glimpse another knife,  Stabbing through my heart, You let him have you. You conform to what he wants,  Yes, follow him, kill me quickly.  You  drew away from  Me  I never wanted that... You assumed, you tore it apart. Loving you has given me only pain,  How can such pain come from pure love? never again, You can't win But it is too late.  I Am Killed  --Note: I'm not suicidal, trust me.  I promise.  But I was really upset, as you can see.  Don't freak.--  Dang, you have no idea how hard it was to keep from swearing in there.  Ah well, I should go to bed.  I really am ok now...

      May I rant about my general dislike for myself again?  No?  Tough, I'm going to.  Because, frankly, I hate me.  I hate me becasue I hate other people, because I go against my morals time and time again, because I do things that I would rather not do, becasue I cannot achieve what I dream of.  I have ideas, but I can never get the ideas down on paper.  I can see things beautifully in my mind, but to construct them is completely impossible.  I have dreams, but I haven't the skill level to succeed at them.  I'm not smart enough, strong enough, fast enough.  98.  I am #98 of 635, unweighted.  I have a freaking 3.55.  I should be doing better than that!  If I intend to go where I want for school, I better start acing everything...  But I can't.  I don't have the discipline to spend all my time studying.  Heck, I can't study, it helps me none.  If I don't learn something the first time around, I just don't know it well.  And I hate the too.  Another thing: I keep hurting people.  Weather they show it or not, I know I hurt them.  Its a terrible feeling, to hurt someone.  Now you say, this could all make for some pretty good music, aye?  Well, I'm sure it could, but I'm terrible at that too.  I have little musical ability... Sure I can *sing*, but I can't play any instruments, really.  Drums don't count here.  I can't read music, and I'm not too good at drums anyways...  Although, I do like the music.  I just wish I were better...  I can't really write well either.  Everything I write is either too boring, or it gets to the point where I get bored with it myself.  Sure, I get a decent poem every now and then, but not that often.    I'm sick of being mediocre... I want to be different... Drastically different.  It frustrates me.

      You'll all think I'm crazy when I finish this thing.  I can't guarantee anything right away, but its quite a twisted storyline.  The shadow was silhouetted against the nearly-black wall, it appeared an empty cell to the passer-by.  A slightly overweight guard truged down the hallway, his keys crashing against his leg, over and over.  He stopped in front of the dark cell, selected a key, and pushed it into the lock.  The lock turned smoothly, and the guard entered the dark.  The shadow never moved, except to assist the man in securing handcuffs on the prisoner.  The shadow followed the guard silently, seeming to sweep over the old tile floor of the asylum.  After a few minutes of walking, they arrived at a door.  The guard fumbled for another key, then put the correct one into the lock. The door swung open to reveal a barren room, containing nothing but an old desk, a large red leather chair, and an old metal chair with straps on the armrests and front legs. The prisoner sat in the chair obediently while the guard strapped him into the chair.  The guard mumbled something to the back of the red chair, and left the room.  The shadow read the all-to familiar words inscribed on the door: Dr. Sloughman, Staff psychiatrist.  To Be Continued in later posts!

      Awesome movie.  Really, it is worth the $8 that AMC is charging.  It was refreshing to see evidence that moral movies with plot and good acting still exist today.  Dennis Quaid is awesome...  The best part... I do believe it was when the super-freeze began to take over everything... Very cool.  I still don't understand how the Timberwolves survived for so long though...  This movie had some awesome stuff in it, some very good drama.  Perhaps the best part was the lack of sex, mass murderers, and aliens.    My Rating: 4 of 5   Then we (Me, TC, Xtine, and Kristin) stood out in front of AMC for a while.  (still not sure why that particular group was there, but hey, I didn't call people, TC did...)  Then we called TC's girlfriend and terrorized her...  Well, he made me... :5  I called her and spoke with a northern accent until I gave up and handed Tim the phone.  Great fun, although I do believe she was slightly less than amused.  Ah well. Church tomorrow, I should go to bed.    Goodnight, my someone, goodnight.

      Hurrah!  I feel so happy knowing that you all take my blog so seriously.  Its... uh... great to see that I'm ruffling some feathers?  Hm, yeah.  Just be warned, I may move my blog so that I am no longer criticized for it, seeing as how I have already pissed numerous people off, people I would rather not hurt.  I would also like to remind you that a blog, such as this one, is a journal, where I can choose to record anything I like in and degree.  If I obsess about one thing but only mention another, it is simply the way I am feeling when I blog.  I would rather  not  receive angry IMs/Emails about something I have written.  Yes, your opinion matters, but no amount of yelling at me is going to change anything.  Also:  If you intend to criticize my poetry and songwriting, please do not take every word as truth.  Often in poetry and song, words are used differently, and Ideas are jumbled up a bit to make for a better sound.  If something that you read sounds like it has disrespect toward something else, please keep this in mind.  This being my personal work, I can change any idea that I wish to be whatever degree I wish.  I can make the largest thing become a single line, and the smallest an entire poem.  Please do not feel offended by my poetry and song, for the reasons I have just stated.  Just remember, I hold this thing called 'artistic license' that allows me to change, distort, or even create emotions and actions.  Please keep this in mind when reading my poetry and song.  Thank you for attending "How to read Mike's Blog 101"  We will resume this series with lesson 102 when the need arises.  Class dismissed.

I might have it by the end of the summer!  Then I can go grocery shopping!  w00t!  Crap... Summer School starts tomorrow, not cool.  But I get both my Ring and my CD burner on Thursday afternoon!  So excited...  I'm out for now!

      You could have had it all I was eating out of your palm Every word you spoke was truth It still is. Dreams are dashed upon the rocks pulled apart by careless thoughts I can't believe I had a hope When I never did I don't want your simpathy I don't want you to be sorry I want you right here in my arms a place you'll never be  I cannot have you, you've told me already But still the hope is there I still dream about you, jump when I hear your name,  My heart skips a beat when you're around Please just don't leave me just don't hate me Please keep me close I still need you to be a friend and get me through this.  Two years I have waited patiently pausing for you al the time that passed, I loved you and I still do I speak of love,  what do I know This fleeting thought it pains me Just to think you were so close and I was off with someone else I had my chance, I messed it up so what else is new?  Refrain   I'll add more verses later.  Not a bad start, aye?

      I'm better now, for those of you who were worried.  Still not terrible joyful, but better.  I ordered a new CD burner to replace my nearly dead one, it's black! ( urlLink Click here )  And I found a small form factor PC that fits my needs!  I was excited... I'll get it someday before college... ( urlLink Click Here )  Yeah... Thats all for now.

      Two years dashed on the rocks enduring the sharp cutting edges smashed in a moment by the waves I've held to this beach for so long  But now I am crushed, gone Dead and cold my body lies One wave crashed down upon me shattering my frame against the jagged rocks one careless wave All this wasted, the suffering the pain I have endured the strength it took to hold on but now my will is crushed I feel me hands slipping slipping slipping away from the stony ledges toward the destruction that looms it pulls me in, and I I have no will to stop it so I fall, I slip and slide my body beaten brutally by the rocks all the sharp edges and the wave still beats against me destroying what I was destroying me destroying My will to hold on is slipping more and more I have no reason to hold on I cannot look for the good side of this I can't get a grip on the positive Dying, I call out, but my words find only deaf ears deaf by choice, or by ignorance? I call, I scream, but no answer comes. Slipping slipping dying closer every moment...

      How can I say what I've always wanted to tell you When it's so close to killing me, so close to the edge I'm teetering on the edge of this deadly slope Just hoping and praying that you'll hold the rope But whether you pull me back up to safety  Of just keep me steady on the edge, I am happy. Of course, you know what I'd like,  But the choice is up to you, just please don't let go My feeble voice barely reaches your ears, pull me in But I can't force you, for if you try to pull And you are not sure you wish to, and you let go My body is crushed, my soul dropped off the edge I would rather you hold me on the brink of falling Then pull me in only to push me off later Just think it over, that's all I ask. Do what you feel is right, and make sure That you believe in what you choose Now, I know that you'd like to pull me in, If only to keep me safe, and keep me alive for a minute longer But if you know you may drop me soon,  Then leave me on the ledge. I will not think any less of you if you keep me up here Just keep a hold on the rope, hold me up here somewhere.   Just hold on... 		Don't let the rope slip 					   Keep me on the edge Or safe at the camp?  Just 	Don't 		Let 			Me 				Fall...   Yeah... that first line is just a setup for the mountain climber imagery, don't try to read anything into it, please.  and look!  It's not sad!

      This morning:  I washed cars outside Wal-Mart in Elk Grove for three hours!  It was so much fun...  My church youth group was doing a fundraiser for a missions trip this summer, so I thought I'd help.  I ended up showing up an hour late 'cause I forgot to wake up on time, but then I stayed an extra hour to make up for it. I got a nice bright red tan!  :5  KTO's party was so much fun! There weren't many people, so it wasn't overly crowded, so that was good.  Would it be appropriate to dance?  To sing and skip because of joy?  To celebrate a mere idea, a plan, a course of action?  I'm so ready, tonight proved it.  Oh, don't try to understand that last paragraph, you won't be able to.  :5  I'm off to do something, then I have to get up for Church, then its Alleigh's graduation party!!  Feel free to stop by, we've got enough food to feed a small third-world country...  I'm out.

In other news, any of you that have seen my sketch that I've been working on for two weeks, its almost done.  3 more drawings left: Back and both sides extended.  I'm so excited. :5  Not really sure why I'm excited... I guess I'm just glad to be sketching something other than somewhat bland computer cases...  Well, my new creation is not so bland... It may very well be awesome! :5  The M30-17 (model number!) is unlike anything you've seen before.  It is a full-functioned Palm organizer (with a 2-inch diagonal touchscreen) with a hard drive and hardware audio control buttons.  I know you don't really care, but its my blog so I can ramble on. :5 But yes... Its pretty spiffy.  It also caused me to come up with my second technology...  I'm such a geek!  But yes...  Now I have two innovations that will help Plexat to hit it big someday... I'll need more than No-downtime backups and SD Buffer to hit it really big, but its a start. :5  Well, I should probably go to bed before I 'splode.  Goodnight!

      I wish to abstain from life, just for a little while.  I want to go into seclusion, I want to pause time, so that I can learn what I have to know, and so I can sleep.  I just want to escape from where I am, and get back to basics.  I need to have another look at my own philosiphies.  I need time to catch up with myself, and then I can get in closer touch with God.   I think that God needs AIM.  There are times that my prayers seem like they're taking too long to be answered... But then I remember that God works in his time.  Although, I must admit, it would be nice to know if he was saying 'no' or 'wait.'  Augh.  I could not stand losing another friend so close... Especially because it was/would be my fault both times.  I could not cope if that happened... I don't even want to think about it.  I hate the looks.... The looks I get when I am near her... They penetrate my soul, and I feel the sorrow...  Then I feel the saddness that is transmitted to me... And I feel terrible... It makes me want to cry...  I feel so bad, I feel like I am knocking the person down and kicking mud it their face...  And I hate myself for it...  Anything for her... Anything.  Her word is truth, her philosophy is fact.  How can she be as blind as she acts?  The only thing I can think of is that she knows... and is keeping quiet because she hopes it is not true...  She wants what she thinks to be a lie, she wants her assumptions proved wrong...  Goodnight. Broke another stick tonight, playing "Take My Life" It feels so good to rock out... She is my motivation... She compells me to play beyond my limit...   The knowledge that she might be able to hear or see... Just that tiny shred of hope...

      Hm.  Let me begin with my van.  It is currently sitting, dead, in the parking lot of EGBC.  It has no battery.  *sniffle*  We got a new one, but the terminal from the old one got ripped off... 'casue the old battery was 10 years old... It's getting fixed tomorrow.  Yay.  And yay to the Chris and the Ashley Flynn, and Gary )(I'm not even going to try spelling his last name) for trying to help!    I like Youth Group becasue it seems like God is sending things right at me... I mean, at Calvary, I never felt like anything applied to me, but now the sermons and lessons talk to me... And they make me think and challenge me.  I like it.    I am so tired... But today and yesterday were worth it.  If there is one thing I regret, it was one thing I could not change all of... I hate to see my friends suffer because of me...  I hate it.  Tomorrow is going to be insane... I'm probably going to take a nap at dinner.  I'll go find a hiding place and sleep.  You know, we were talking about being lost at youth group, and I though of the feling I had when I got lost in a mall in Kenosha when I was younger...  It was a scared, lost feeling, like things would never be ok again... And then I realized that I felt that again, in a lesser degree, with my relationship that broke... You know the one.  I mean, I was so lost, I though that things would never be right... But they are...  I know that none of you really care so much as to get into my deeper religious thinking, but God pulled me out... And he put people in my way to show me that things will be ok.  And now I am presented with another friend whom I feel strongly towards, but this time I know that it is better to say nothing and love in silence, that way, when she is ready, I'll still be there, loyal and loving as ever, ready to take her hand.  And, if I am not the one, then I will be there, loyal and loving as ever, ready to help her along, and support her with whomever she decides is right.  And it's hard to let go like that... And it's scarry... But God has shown me that if I let him drive, I get to all the good spots.    Alright, now if you must know what inspires these thoughts, its the videos at  urlLink Nooma.com.     Well, I mean, I don't know where to go from here.  Tomorrow's practice is going to be insane...  And if anyone touches my drums, they will be subject to all my wrath built up over the duration of the play.  There is the possibility of drumsticks being used as murder weapons, if necessary.  Except J-man.  He's cool... and he knows how to respect that stuff.  But even he will be warned that my new heads are sacred.  :5    Alright, I really should go to bed.    I've got the mic, and you've got the mosh pit.  Yay TBS... How I love them.    Girl, you have my heart wrapped around your finger, and you're playing with it like a yo-yo  Up and down, up and down  (Up and down, up and down, up and down)  Everything you say goes, You pull me in    ooo...

      Hm...  Start at the beginning... Well, I won't go into  urlLink Alleigh's  greavances against today...  They're not mine.    I had my first A+ test scheduled at 9.30AM at the Harper TECH center... I showed up, spent about five minutes emptying my pockets...  They require you to empty EVERYTHING!  I couldn't have a watch... or keys.  Crazy.    I had 90 minutes for each test... Both took me 30.  I ended up taking one at 9.30, then I waited a bit and took the second at 10.30.  I was done at 11.00...  And I waited until 12.20 for my mom to get back.    Went from there home, then went to  urlLink Guitar Center  and got some heads.   urlLink Evans  genera g2's.  All 2-ply, and the toms are clear, the snare coated.  I didn't replace my bass head, 'cause it sounds fine.  Oh man... My drumset sounds AWESOME!  I still need my snare replaced, but it sounds so much better than it did with the [crappy]  urlLink Pacific  heads... Oh how I love it.  My drumset is hot...  And when I get it all set up with Rob's double bass pedal, it will rock.  Yay.    Then to Quartet practice.  Ugh, how do I suck that much?  I mean, I got it after a bit, but I sound so bad on my own... I can blend just fine, but on my own its terrible.  Ugh...    Hm...  Today really had no emotion until just before Quartet practice, when I was having a conversation.  Now, you know my policies... I'm not telling what went on, but let it be known that it was hardly encouraging.  Ugh.  I will continue to press on though, mostly because of the wonderful friendship I still have, and the oh-so-true words of Dr.Z: "You're not the kind of guy girls date, you're the kind they marry."      I certainly hope so...  I just need someone to hold... A girl to love me.  Not to say that all my female friends don't 'love' me in the way all friends do... But it is hardly acceptable to cuddle with one's friends... :5    Operation: Trump Card: Phase Technical Advance is complete.  On to Phase Technical Application.    Haha... so  urlLink TC  came over and helped me tune my new heads, and we took the old snare head off, and we were talking about the good old days of  urlLink P9 .  We signed it for  urlLink Kaitlin , our awesome Merch girl!  'Cept TC forgot it at my house, so its right here.  9-hour Godspell II: The Voices of Light practice... But it's ok, I'm bringing my drums.  I expect a standard practice.  If those freshmen don't listen, I'm going to have to bust out some drumstick beatings.  And don't think I won't.

       The lights all stand still, My rushing is over    I can walk slowly with you    Hold you in my arms, and I know we'll never part.    Pull you close, I can feel your heart beating    Can you see how scared I am...    Because you mean everything to me    And I couldn't bear to lose you    All ym hopes and dreams are shown through you    You represent all I love    How can I risk losing you    With something so foolish as my own emotions    I can't tell what you want,     But I pray for for what you need      Nice... But today was CRAZY!  First, I got up late for school... then I went, and Got a B on my final, and an A (94.7%) for the semester!  That make it STRAIGHT A's for the summer!  YEEEHA!  I came home for about 20 minutes, and spent most of that on the phone.  I left at 1 to go to ORUMC for the Godspell II Quartet... Then, at 2, I trekked over to LaRoy's house, to try and fix his ailing internet... with no success.  Left there at 4, and headed home real quick to grab stuff for Jenna's, then I picked up TimShaw(tm) and we headed on over to Jenna's.  Spent several hours in the pool... Which was fun, except for my unexplainable fear of underwater pool lights... Lindsey just about gave me a heart attack...  But yes.  We watched friends, then it was time to go.  And now I'm home blogging.  Tomorrow... A+ tests at 9.30 and 12.00...  Ends at two, then over to Morgan's at 4.30 for some more Quartet-ness.      Today could have been a very bad day, if I had given up.  But when I got up late, I looked around, and I though, "I have the choice to make today good or bad."  I made it a good day...  And the day responded better than I could have ever hoped.      So close but so far...    I'd rather be this close and never move closer than than to be closer, then thrown far away.      Remember my post, "is this time like the last time" )or something like that)?  Well, the first stap has been taken to restore the lost friendship I spoke of.  It makes me feel so happy to know that I haven't lost her.  I mean, there's no chance that I will attempt to date her or anything, but she was one of my closest friends.  But I did learn a few things from the mistakes I made with her, things that I am applying at this very moment.  Thats another thing that makes me happy... That I am learning.  Every day should be, and is, a learning experience, but few things stay with you like this.  I mean, you learn things subcontiously, but the few things that you learn that stay in the upper part of your mind...  The things you recall when you need them most.      It makes me want to smile, and never stop.  I want to hold her in my arms, but I know that may not be for the best...  So whatever is best for her... That is what I will do.  Now I just have to hold on until God shows me what is best...      P.S.-- Sorry for the lack of links, They'll be back for the next posts.  Say, do y'all like the links?

       "12. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a pretty ring."    Is this true ladies?  I need to know... :5  All you Blog readers (except   my sister  ... its just odd getting dating advice from her... she talks to me in person :5) are now becoming my dating tuors, whether you like it or not. :5      Finals tomorrow...  I think I'm ready.  I spent some time studying... and filling out the study guide.      Practice today made me want to beat just about everyone, for one reason or another.  Yes, everyone.  I finished fixing my skit again... although Ruth doesn't have too many superhero skills... I had to make some stuff up for the start...   But yes.        Operation: Trump Card: No new updates.      The Board of Trustees 36-hour day schedule is being made...  It's going to be odd... We are taking 3 normal, 24-hour days, and creating 2 36-hour days.  12 to sleep, 12 for recreation, 12 for work.  Its a crazy schedule, and We have to bend it a little... but after we take over the world, everyone will convert to it.  It's really a good plan...      Well, I should be going to bed now.      Goodnight.

      Awesome. Practice. We started some acting, and people liked Eric's and my skits... It felt good to be laughed at, although nobody got the " urlLink Captain Planet " refrence... The sheep scene... Oh man. My sister rocks. When Eric+I did it the first time, I shouted "AHH!" and then, in a normal voice, said "eh." ( urlLink Canadian  shepherds). She took it a step further, she dove to the floor for the shout, then sat up normally for the "eh." Hahaha... And  urlLink TimShaw(tm)  is awesome... He is crazy good at nearly everything... :5  Everyone is mad at TC for his " urlLink Squal Theory " My greatest triumph tonight was my self-control! I was so pleased to be able to control what I did, instead of letting my mind go on overload and the rest of me runing the show. Tonight rocked. I do wonder what solo(s) I shall recieve... I can't wait to find out tomorrow.    Two more days of  urlLink Summer School ! Then, on Thursday, I shall be taking my A+ Tests. Yes, it will be 3 hours of my day at Harper, but that's ok. TC spoke of re-releasing all the  urlLink p9  songs as BOT songs... Perhaps. This I would consider. I think that we could do them better... I'm so excited for the new project.    I still ahve to fix  urlLink Ciupka 's computer...  Ah well.    Operation: Trump Card, Phase: Produce. The first stage turned out to be an impromptu mission, which gathered some vital, and valuable information

      Last time someone dwelled in my mind like this, she brutally beat me, emotionally speaking.  Nothing good came of it at all... She assumed what was true, and now she's not speaking to me.  All because I tried to show her how I felt.  Evidently I was forcing myself upon her, although I never once heard her ask me to stop doing anything, nor did she remove herself from anything.  Believe me, I can take a hint.    It still hurts inside everytime she comes online, or when I see her.  She just cut me off... I can barely have a conversation with her.  The last time I saw her, she welcomed my sister, but not I.  She did not speak to me, nor did she respond with any kind of real answer when I spoke to her.  And that is what I am afraid of.  I am afraid of my feelings, however earnest, tearing down a friendship.  I believed that the girl I loved was mature enough to believe me that I wanted her as a friend if no more was possible.  Evidently, she was not.  The only good thing I got out of it was a little over a year of friendship and several good songs and poems. (Two of which wil be on "The Epitome Of Doubt",the next  urlLink p9  CD,  due out to friends and family soon, we hope.)    I don't want my own easily-swayed emotions to ruin this.  I don't want my hard-fought self-control to kill it either.  "I'd rather have you as a friend forever than anything else for a limited time."  I know that I am hardly a 'good catch.'  Something Dr.Z told me at Morgan's house keeps runing through my mind...  "You're not the kind of guy people date, you're the kind they marry."  The Dr. was about as successful as I was in high school... and he rocks, so that means I have hope.  I just wish I had a little more control over what I feel... My mindset is easily swayed by music, misinformation, and how much sleep I've had.  I can give advice that works, but trying my same tactics on my life doesn't seem to work.  My mind works on common sense, and mathematical patterns.  My body is biological, and it follows no pattern...  Emotions are the killers of normal, upstanding people.  I don't want to drown in  urlLink TC's Flood ...  I want to be able to put my feelings for that girl on a shelf, and let my Friend take her for once.  I want to be selfless... To keep myself from her.  But it is so hard!  I see her smile, and I lose every kind of restraint that I had to stay away from her.  She pulls me in, although I don't think she knows what she does to me...   I want to catch up on my sleep, so that when urlLink  School  is over, and I pass my  urlLink A+ tests ,  I can pour my heart and soul into the show... I want to work myself to death to make it work.  I am going to push myself above the rest, to a place of authority, so that they will listen when I talk.  And I really don't care what anyone says behind my back, because it'll show me my true friends:  Those who respect, and try to help me.    I will be the best I can be, for her, and for God.  Not necessarily in that order...

       He fingered the knife.  Something told him that this was the right thing to do... the resolution to his problem... to everyone's problem.  But did he have the courage?  One thrust, and it would all be fixed.  Painless, and easy.  One stab through the heart.  He had made sure to prepare for the monumentous event, he wrote letters to everyone, telling each that they were not to blame.  His family, he knew, would cry, would mourn him, but the rising cost of college and his father's unemployment  made this a better solution.  But what about everyone... everything he was leaving behind?  He had a beautiful girl... No, wait, nevermind that.  She was gone, without a hope for him.  It had been a terrible fight with his best friend... and he hadn't seen either of them in over a week.  He thought about everything he had ever done... sitting quietly on the floor.  in a moment of fury, he thrust the knife into his chest.  The blood flowed freely in his mind...  He reached his hand down to where the would should have been... it was not there.  He had only imagined it... The phone began to ring, but he did not pick it up.  With tears falling freely from his eyes, he looked over the note he had written.  He fingered an envelope, with a girl's name written on it... he shakily opened it and read what he had written to his love.  He finished reading the neatly folded sheet, took the knife in his hand, and flung it into the wall.  Breathing heavily, as though he had just run a race, he walked out he door, and down the hall.  The phone continued to ring.  He picked it up, and cleared his throat, to try and sound normal...    Must life go on, when conflict is surly ahead?    Don't worry... I'm not writing about myself.  I'm not suicidal.  But I wish I could get away from it all, I wish something would work out for me...  Selfish wishes bring only greif.    I love her.  I don't care what anyone says.  But I have no chance anymore...  But there is a slight chance.  And may I be stricken dead if I do not take that chance.      Take That Chance.    I'd rather have you as a friend than not at all.

       Ladies and Gentilemen, I would like to take this opportunity to let you in on a small bit of information:    WHEN I AM DOING SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY, DO NOT ASSUME THAT I AM ANGRY OR DEPRESSED!    If there is something that I am experiencing that I believe you absolutely need to know, you will be told.  I will make a public service announcement, in person, to let you know what you need to know.  Don't worry, I won't let you miss out on anything you need to know.      Now, stop spreading rumors about me and my actions.    Need I remind you of   this  ?      Now, leave me alone inside this social ring.    You will be informed if necessary.

         Sorry about me rapid changes of emotion... It?s been an odd day, to say the least.  I'll try to reveal as much as is safe in my poems.  Feel free to interpret!    Brought alive by a smile  I'm lost in your eyes  They're pulling me in  The way you look at me  Every time, I want to hold you  Reading your body, looking for clues  Help me out, I'm trying to find  A reason to hold on here  Pressure on all sides  Pushing in on my chest  I can't breathe too well anymore  Never again... I won't let it end  Even my heart gives out,   Save me... My mind's giving out  Somewhere... Somehow...    Oooo... there's a hidden secret in that one.  Look for it... then comment.  First person to tell me what it is wins bragging rights!    Hm... See, there's a mood swing right there... I was going to write another poem, but the depression left me in the middle of the one up there.    All I can say is that today, I learned a lot.  And it was a pretty good rehearsal.    Pretty good.    Just like me.      Pretty Good...  But am I good enough?    Yes.  I am.  If someone thinks I'm not good enough, they are the ones lacking.  I am one.  An individual.  And God made me this way.  He's running things.  And dangit, I think God is better than anyone.      Haha... I'm feeling warm and fuzzy.

But today's mission is simple: keep the Doctor happy.  My team of special againts and I are in a crowd control situation.  Keep everyone quiet, and paying attention.    It's harded than it looks... and with the psycologial attack surrounding me, I'm not sure if I'm going to make it alive...    (Sorry... We watched Vietnam videos all day in US History...)

         We now return you to your regularly scheduled blog:    I'm sitting at practice... And I'm so addicted to blogging, that I'm writing this out. Oh! I saw  urlLink Mae  last night with Kaitlin, Korbecki and Nate. It was AWESOME! Let?s see... Sleeping at last, Modern Dance, and Days Away were there too.  What a concert... especially considering that it was my first! :5 Awesome amounts of fun.      Hm... Blogger won't let me upload images... I wonder why not...    Back to the script:  But I guess you are all on pins and needles wondering about the title, and the subject of the analysis. I will be analyzing two different plans of action, plan Alpha (A) and plan Gamma (G). Both are trying to achieve a prize from a ruler, who knows nothing of the plots to attain the prize. We will be looking at the strategies **WE INTERRUPT THIS SENTANCE TO BRING YOU A RANDOM COMMENT: Haha... Minifridges rock... THIS ENDS OUR COMMENT. THANK YOU.**  through the eyes of the executor of Plan Gamma.    My opponent seems to lurk in the shadows whenever he is not actively assaulting the front, which he does at intervals that seem unplanned. It seems, at this stage, that he has a great advantage over me... his advances are more numerous... It seems as though he is favored, but then again, I am perhaps more suspicious than normal. I am advancing whenever possible, but my attempts are often overshadowed by the flattery of the other contestants, who have more skill than I.    Hm.  That was an odd little drama bit there.      Well, I should be off.  Good Evening.    Mae is Awesome!  http://www.purevolume.com/mae  ^listen to Mae^

       Inspired by TimShaw's(tm) latest.    Where have you been all my life?  You can understand me,   really understand me  and I love you for it  But is this a love I need?  Can I do without it?  Do I want that social tag?  Don't get me wrong,   I want to be with you,   but it seems like  they are all just waiting  to tear it apart  Rip it to shreds,   and hope I have of you.    and then there's this poem:  I can't believe you  How can you act like that?  you criticize me 'casue I'm not perfect  Should I point out your flaws?  No, I'm merciful, unlike you  You make me weak,   you make everyone laugh at me  but I see what is really in your eyes  Fear.  Fear of burning out  Fear of being beaten by someone  I know I pose no threat, now  but someday, I will have my reward  My reward from God,   for trying to live morally  and trying my hardest  and always returning to Him  when I needed help.  You know that I'm good enough  And you feel you have to tear me down  down to a lower level  shere I pose no threat to your fake life.  Go ahead, beat me up now  I'll rise up from my injuries  and when all the world falls away,   I'll be on my solid rock  and you will fall, burning  because you would not believe  would not accept  would not repent  You beat me down  but who will end on top?    Hm... that kind-of turned into some life-after-death imagery there. Pretty spiffy... well, I thought so anyways...    I guess I should go to bed...  sleep well.

       Well, Godspell II: The Voices of Light practice went alright...  I just wish I could contain myself...  I mean, I can only be entertaining for so long...  Arg.  But I suppose... Eh, no.  I always get out of control, then someone always ends up getting hurt...  and I look stupid.  I hate it...  Why am I cursed with so little control?  I suppose it is my responsibility to work on it... so I shall.  Rosie just told me to stop thinking so much...  I probably should.  Well, I suppose you're all wondering about the TBS Squirt gun... See, Kaitlin (Emo Grandma!) went to Warped Tour today, and got TC a Squirt gun signed by TBS.  Its cool, really.  This Emo stuff, I like it.  I'm out... No practice tomorrow, I get to hang out for a while!  sleep well.

       Hm... I was kinda bored, and I have to leave in like, 10 minutes to babysit... But I just got this thought, like I should write this.    I suppoes its kind-of morbid, but hey.    To any girl whom I have/had/will have a crush on:  Now, I know that you've all heard something like this before, but I want you to read this and know that I am sincere. The first thing that I have to stress is that our friendship comes first. I would rather have you as a friend forever than as a girlfriend for a few days. The most importnant thing to me is that you're happy. Don't worry about me, I've managed before, I can do it again. Just be honest, and tell the truth, no matter how painful it may seem. Also, Please keep in mind that when I compose poetry, nearly all of the time I exaggerate the situation, and inflate the feelings, be they happy or sad. I never mean to hurt you... It's just the way things keep working out for me... Oh, one more warning: for all you dating veterans who know the ropes of high-school dating, I don't. I mean, I've had very little experience, and I still don't know what to do when... But that's about it. I suppose there's one more... I tend to be tactle. I'll let you look that word up. I'm not entirly sure how to state what I truly mean in words... it always shows up wrong... But if you've been around me long enough for me to seriously consider you a crush, you'll know what I mean.  Thanks.  --Mike.

       First the poem:  You're not so beautiful anymore  Thats not the face I wanted to see  you cut me off "to give me space"  I see what it really is  You can't have me as an admirer  I feel more than that?    I'm no longer a friend  Your face makes me remember  All the happiness I felt  Now I see my own mistake  and I want to apologize for myself  But I can't get close enough to tell you  What you don't want to hear.    Alright, got that out of my system.  Onto today's good-ness.  It was just a happy day, again.  My proclimation is being stuck to, and Jenna is speaking to me again.  We worked out a compromise.  In other news... My Emo conversion is continuing. :5  Hm... Does Merch Girl/Surrogate Emo Grandmother Caitlin read my blog?  She will have to leave me a comment if she does!  Hm... Brett says there's an AudioA shirt that says "Hey, More Cowbell" or something to that effect.  I want it. :5    So I guess that is all.  Pray for... a friend.  She's got some crazy stuff going on...    I want my schedule soon... and I hope I have mr. Pinisi (sp?) for AP Physics and Ms. Maddox for English.    Well, I should be going to bed.  OO! I wrote a lot more of my(and erics...)  Godspell II: Voices of Light  skit.    Alright, Now I'm going.  Goodnight, My someone.    You don't know who you are, but I want to make you mine.  Hold you in my arms and talk all night  It seems to be a trend with me  to fall in love again and again.  But you have the lasting impression  A long time apart, and it all rushes back  You don't know that I love you...  But I think that I do  Love can't be for sure  not this young  so Until I know  I love you in whatever way I can    Woah, y'all just got two poems in one blog!  Crazyness... A happy one and a mad one!  w00t.

       Emo.  I once detested it.  But now I'm loading up on it.  Taking Back Sunday, Yellowcard, The Ataris, Brand New, you name it.  And I like it.  So, in a sense, I've turned Emo overnight.  but hey, I can't leave everything else behind.  Everything except Rap, I think.  Yay Emo!    Oh, and my State of the union promise is being enforced.  Ask Jenna.

                During the duration of the play which is currently at hand, I expect to see an abnormally large amount of social tension, jealousy, and hatred arise.  This catastrophic event is unavoidable in a group of peers who are held together in close quarters such as the cast of this show.  Therefore, I also expect emotions to be severely afflicted by pain and suffering incurred by a trend of mass inter-cast relationships.  I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the explicit details of these various relations will be candidly disclosed to any and all parties willing to accept the rumors so viciously spread.    I regret that this ruthless distribution of exaggerated information causes further social stress, and can result in highly uncomfortable situations among the supposed participants of the falsified information.    Due to the rampant injury of innocent bystanders in said events, I would like to inform all cast members that the safest course of events is to cease the public distribution of rumors at their very beginnings.    Is it not simpler to keep one?s interests away from those which have the potential to be destructive in some manner than to be foolishly curious?    Although the temptation of gossip is strong, I wish to abstain from the unmerciful practice.    Also, details about whatever relationships I am a part of will be undisclosed to those uninvolved.                 I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.                  In English:    I don?t want to know what goes on behind the scenes with the Godspell II cast, I don?t want to hear rumors about anyone, nor will I spread any information about anything I may do.             This is my official withdrawal.

      Sorry for the kindergarten-esque title, I couldn't resist.  I mean, things kind-of got a whole lot brighter today.  Everything today inspired me!  The WWII and Holocoust videos were so... powerful.  Then digging at the beach... well, a sort-of beach.  But still, digging in the sand.  Then some Godspell II, which was surprisingly unboring.  *immense surprise*  I mean, I actually enjoyed myself at a rehersal for the first time this show.  Awesomeness.  It seems like someone reached over and turned on the lights to the world.  Oh, Lindsey owes me a back rub.  She told me to remind her.  I really should go to bed... But its a no-homework, nowhere to go, mow the lawn weekend! So I'll stick around for a bit more. But this blog will end...   ..now.

      Hm.  What to say.  Well, I suppose I should make some great proclamation.  But I have none.  I mean, I have great hope and joy in my mind, but I require positive conformation in my own mind before I attempt to implant it in others.  It pleases me greatly to speak in large words, mostly becsaue most people will simply skim this anyways.  I do believe that most of the time I'm just blogging for myself, which is fun.  No, really.  So anyways.  I'm mad at Congress, I bet you can guess why.  yeah, they didn't pass the Marrage Amendment.  accursed land of sin... Ah well.  God will return eventually, and he'll pull me out of this place.  Anyways...  So I guess thats it really.  Company Picinic tomorrow, so I can't go to Godspell II writing.  You know, I'm really starting to detest some of those songs.    Really  detest them.  But hey, as a performer, I must accept the good with the bad...  But I really should go to bed.  I want to drive... I want My dad to get the Focus Wagon, and get rid of the van.  I want a Job.  I want my A+.  I want.  I.  Why is it all about me... I want... the world to be a better place.  I want kids to be able to grow up in a place they feel safe.  I want offensive music, TV and movies removed.  I want God to come take me back... along with eveyone else.  But if he can't come now, thats ok too.  Becsaue I want to feel love again before I leave.  Hm.  Its so odd to think about what you would do If you had three wishes.  But really, I think I could solve things in one wish.  All I want tonight is to heal the world take all this evil away, sweep it clean but I'm no superhero, I can't save people nobody listens when I make my speeches so How can I change the world?  Is a song enough to move you to pull you to the light side am I getting through to you can you feel my embrace?  another song.  you know, I can get little bits of songs...  but its not all that often that I can finish.  I hope I can finish this one... Yay.

      Hm.  I'm not sure what to blog, really.  I'm tired, and more angry with myself than I have been in a long time.  But I don't really want to rant.  I'm just... eh.  I can't really decide what to do next.  I mean, I think option one is gone. I have no hope left in that relationship, its pretty much toast.  I mean, I got shot down, and now she won't even talk to me.  I can't fully blame her, nor can I fully blame myself.  It ended how it ended, and I can say that I'm not happy about it, but I can't change it.  Look forward.  Option 2: Its kind-of a new thing in my mind, although it is the renewal of a nearly year-old thought.  I suppose it could work, seeing as how we're both single again.  It would have worked last time, and I'll have to see if I want it to.  There are really no more options here, just two.  Well, only two serious ones.  And only one possible.  I guess my plan is pretty laid out for me, aye?  But I need to get back to the point I was with her last time.  I don't want any undue drama.  Keep it a secret.  Tell very few, and swear them to secrecy.    The feeling won't go away.  Anger, boiling up, I want relief.  I want to destroy and crush.  And to sleep.  It all spins in my head, a simple melody Why could God let this happen to me I've tried to be good, I've tried to live right But I'm still here crying, crying tonight. I've lost everything, nothing left from before Friends all turned their backs, left me in the dust Help me Lord, I've got to get up, I must  What the heck?  I honestly don't know where that came from... But it has now been accepted as the start of a song for Godspell II.  Yay Job!  **I'm out.

      I am finished.  I'm sick of critics and people overshadowing me.  I am done with being made fun of and ridiculed.  I don't care what you have to say about me.  Shove it.  You want to hurt me?  Go freaking ahead.  Everyone does anyway.  Even these people I call my 'friends.'  Yeah, mike's my friend, let?s go harass him and piss him off.  Gee, real good friendship.  I'm sick of people looking down on me because I'm not the best.  Get over it.  Not everyone can be the best... Maybe if you looked a little beyond the mere talent, and looked into a person.  Maybe I'm not squeaky clean, but at least I try to be.  I try to keep myself pure, and its freaking hard.  But then again, most people today wouldn?t understand that struggle.  They all just want their athletics, rap, and sex.  And drugs, can't forget drugs, smoking, and alcohol.  Look at me.  I've had only three girlfriends of not, and I've only kissed one.  I hardly started young.  Most kinds my age started in 3rd grade.  Why?  I don't know.   But I've gotten off topic.  I was talking about the false friends.  You know, the elitists.  The ones who don't fully accept you unless you're the best.  Or, if you are someone significantly worse than them.  Oh, I'm not good enough.  I can't sing perfectly.  Heaven forbid I take responsibility.  I don't want to hear your jabs and sneers.  You can go tell yourself those things about me, you stuck up egotist.  Go put me down so you can get higher and higher on your drug.  I'm not is your high society, so I am ridiculed.  Just keep connections with me for good public relations.  Use me for what little I'm worth.  Seduce me into your good graces then leave me hanging.  What, you're standing there?  I thought I told you to leave.  Yeah, pull me in and stomp on my pride.  That?s what will get you advanced. You know, in the last few months, I've felt more rage than ever before in my life.  I have had the nearly uncontrollable desire for  blood .  To injure and destroy.  I want to tear apart the jeering faces.  I want them washed away in a pool of their own blood and tears mixed together.  But I know that I'll have revenge soon enough.  God will take care of everything. But what about now?  I mean, God may take a while.  For now...  You see, I cannot threaten people; I have nothing to back it up.  But... what?  How am I to defend myself?  Oh sure, people will say 'count on me to do that' but nobody ever does.  It?s all a joke to everyone.  I'm a joke to everyone. Oh look, there?s another thing to make me feel  oh-so-much  better.  Another attempt at love shot down so carelessly.  Convince me that she cares.  I'm waiting.  What?  You can't?  Exactly.  I am so deep in that I would  run myself through  to have her tell me she loved me.  But she couldn't care less.  Not that I blame her.  Not at all.  I mean, it is me after all.  That?s completely understandable. Now, I'm taking comments off this one, because I don't want any sympathy.  Don't comment for this one on another.  I'm telling you now that I'll delete it.  Don't waste yours or my time. Back to my 'discussion'... So where was I?  Oh yes, I believe I was ranting about my lack of perfection.  Well.  I guess there is little else to pen on this subject. I shall leave you with one parting thought. I am not, will not be, and have no desire to be elite.  Stop trying to make me look stupid because I?m not.  Oh, and bite me. Yes, you know to whom I'm speaking.  P.S.: If you haven't committed any of the aforementioned crimes, you don't have any right nor any need to be angry.  Thanks.  **this post was originally written on June 13 at about 10.00PM**

      Well, after an uneventful ride home, I'm back!  Got home, vegged out on the 'puter for a while, then went to VBS at church.  Fun stuff... But I'm still toasted...  blagh... But it was worth it :5 Hm... I have to get up like, fifteen minutes earlier, 'casue now I get to drive to school...  Eh.  No, not on my own.  My sister goes to work at 7, so I drive from Fairview (I think) to SHS.  Then I either bum a ride of walk home.  Yay!  So anyways, the friends we stayed with this weekend were awesome.  We spent like, 8 hours at the car show, it was awesome.  Got an original Chevelle badge, and the Ford 390 badge.  Pictures later.  I also saw my dream car...  It was absolutely beautiful.  1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 with the 428 Cobra Jet.  Yeah...  Anyways, if I may rant for a moment... Someone explain why I keep meeting awesome girls, with both the personality and the attractiveness, that I have absolutely no hope with.  You know, its starting to get really annoying.  I mean, awesome dating material!  People that can appreciate people like me...  Offbeat, crazy, strange people.  You know, there aren't many girls who can understand what its like to be completely shunned by every bit of pop culture.    I mean... Just about everyone has a section of society that they fit into... I have none...  There is no place for the moral geek drummer.  The porn-obsessed hacker drummer yes, but not I.   So here's my want ad:  Seeking a moral, Christian girl who can put up with an Obsessive-Compulsive Geek.  Must be able to put up with social ineptitude and often foot-in-mouth situations.  No experience with serious dating, cannot drive as of yet.  Must be patient and willing to 'train'  yay... My want ad!  Feel free to answer... But no pity.  I want absolutely no pity, nobody telling me that they;d date me when I know darn well they wouldn't... :5 I'm out.

      Ahhh, I just love Christian-based writers, and the movie reviews they give. excerpts from Plugged In's review of this film. ( urlLink Link )  "For Slate.com, Christopher Hitchens, a left-leaning journalist, wrote, ?To describe [Fahrenheit 9/11] as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability.? He goes so far as to compare Moore to Leni Riefenstahl, who made those gorgeously photographed propaganda films for Adolf Hitler."  "Maybe it?s because Moore considers him goofy or stupid and assumes we all think the same."  "These are all tried-and-true tricks of the trade when it comes to making fictional films. Moore insists he's not creating fiction, but reporting facts"  "Moore went to great lengths to defend himself before Fahrenheit 9/11 even hit theaters, and has threatened to sue anyone who attacks him or the film. (This from a man who depends on a very generous First Amendment to do what he does for a living.) "  yeah, I'm a conservitave.  In other news, I reskinned just about all of my main programs today, WinXP, Trillian, Firefox, and I changed the color of the M$ office tool bar to match my new silver theme.

      Well, Sony's Connect Music store is downloading, so that I can redeem the song's I got with my big mac!  Unfortunately, the software is 30MB... Which is a long time on my connection.  So you get more of my psyco-killer story!  The shadow read the all-to familiar words inscribed on the door: Dr. Sloughman, Staff psychiatrist.  Every day for the last seven months, he had come here.  The doctor never talked much about the murder, which the prisoner found odd, but he never questioned the doctor.  Today felt different... The doctor, when he finally turned around, was dressed nicely, unlike his normal disheveled style of dress.  He pressed a black button on his desk, and a door to his left opened, and another nicely dressed man walked into the room.  The doctor spoke slowly and clearly, making sure that every word was understood by the inmate.  "This is Mr.Nishin, a lawyer in your court case.  He wants to hear you tell the story again, ok?"  The shadow nodded.  He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.  After a short coughing spell, and a glass of water, he began to speak. "it was eight months ago yesterday that it happened.  I was so perfect, the perfect crime.  You know, sir, that they tell me I'm a very sick man.  I just obey them, and they let me be.  You know, if I had only called another cleaner for the carpet...  But thats getting ahead of the story."  "Mr. Nishin, I must explain something first," interrupted the doctor, "Dr. Edane has the belief taht--" "I can explain it, sir.  I must take one soul by my hand to be fufilled in life.  It is my destiny, my ultimate goal.  May I continue with the story now, sir?"  The lawyer nodded, not bothering to look up from his clipboard.  "It all began one afternoon, only two weeks after I broke out of prison for the second time.  I had escaped to a small suburb of Seattle, where i was hiding out, and renting an appartment with money I had stored away n the bank, under an alias.  I was put in jail for attempting murder, attempting to achieve my purpose.  I knew that I had to get out to finish the job, to complete my life. "One afternoon, while I was shopping for some things, I saw a pair of young teens sitting at a counter.  I watched them from behind a shelf, and it became apparent that these were the two sorts of people I needed for my fufillment.  The girl, weak minded and cold-hearted.  The boy, in love and feeling a strong desire to be a hero.  He would do anything for the girl, who would show no gratitude, not even noticing the boy's efforts to win her."

      Have you ever felt... content?  Dare I say happy?  I am.  I had a good time tonight, world conquest and all.  Thoughts of her left my mind for a short time, something that has not occurred for more than ten minutes.  It was all day!  Well, most of it.  There were a few times interspirsed throughout the day.  But it was so free, to be able to break away for a bit.  Fun times tonight, more Risk with Jen, 'lil Bro, TC, DanaP and Linda!  I so won...  Well, I would've if we had finished the game.  I'm having a great time with this Risk streak.  I do believe that it is the game that will be around for a while.  See, I like playing with people who really get into it, and who play the TS/NS/MB edition.  Yeah, Me , TimShaw and Starz came up with it.  Basically, it is normal Risk, but just about anything is posible.  You can form treaties, alliances, trades, deals, etc. at any time durring your turn or if you are being attacked, with the person who is attacking you.  The only catch:  all agreements must be made publicly over the gameboard.  Thats about it.  I'm going to shower, then go to bed.   Arg...

Just keep on pushing, I've got to hold on I won't let her go, won't ever let go You tell me to move on, but I won't budge, I'm here 'till I die So really, I haven't lost yet Can you ever lose if you die trying? I'm not really sure, but I'll keep you posted After she kills me, I think that I'll know So I'll keep on going, keep up the show I've got to seem happy, not show all the despair and hatred I feel Hatred toward me and how I am, and what I do Every careless action played back in my mind they remind me of what I really am. Not good enough to have you I couldn't protect you,  though I'd do my best I know that a lot of the time I'm clumsy and inept But you?  I can change Anything for you, I'd give my life Lay down at your feet if you needed me to I'm holding on, never letting go I'm always here...

      Holy. Cow.  That movie was amazing.  It more than surpassed the original, which is also awesome!  Acting was amazing... Not to mention Kirsten Dunst... But I'll talk about that later in the post.  This is the kind of move that sucks you in... I barely noticed that two hours had passed.  Awesome fight scenes, and some crazy plot twists mixed together with the dramatic love plot between MJ and Parker to form the best movie I've seen since the original Spider-Man. 5 of 5.  w00t.  Now, about Kirsten Dunst... Oh man.  Well, I suppose I shouldn't rant about this here... But let me say... Go see this movie and you will understand.  The hottest female...  *sigh*  Haha... Ok, I suppose everyone gets at least one movie star crush... :5  Well, it's 9.59, so I should be going to bed.  Go see the movie!!

But I can only put 10 numbers in, and the first three are taken.   so here's how it looks: 1 - TC home 2 - TimShaw(tm) home 3 - TC mobile 4-0 - open.  Do you think you deserve a spot on my speed dial?  Do I call you enough  to justify putting you there?  So leave me a comment.  And tell me why you think I should have you on  speed dial!  Can you tell I'm bored? Well, I'm out.

       Today I learned:       How to throw a football     How to catch a football     That it is quite painful to want the best for someone     That true love means wanting the best for someone       I also:       Improvised a song that had a real refrain (I missed the train again/I sent my regards with the baggage clerk/Hoping soehow they'll get to you/and I'm writing this letter)     Improvised a different song, that was creepy and haunting  Ate a bag of chips with TC, and there were some left when we were done!  And yes, that is the first time that's ever happened.  Amazing!         Haha... That's terrible, I just said something about 'true love.' I really should be hit for that. But TC jammed all the fingers on my left hand with the football, so I guess it's even.     I really should go.     But I can't... I want to stop feeling the way I do... The feeling of love is stronger than ever, but I don't want it. I want to close my eyes, ears, and cut off all my senses, so I don't have to have any contact. I want to be unconscious, floating in black. I want her to find the right person, and love him. FIND HIM! I need her to... I need to implant it into my mind that I am not for her... and she not for me. At least for now... So my prayer will to continue to be for her to find the right person, and for her to be happy. Muahaha... you all don't know who this mysterious 'she' is. But I do. And, well, I'm sure some of you do, although almost nobody reads this anymore...    Ah well...     I'm out.

      Alright.  I was just checking out soem random Journals, and I found a few things that really make me angry.  1) Background and Text combinations that make it IMPOSSIBLE to read.  Sure, it might look cool for a little bit, but NOBODY can read it!  If someone's Journal has illegible text, bam, its gone.  And another thing... Have these people ever heard of THUMBNAILS?  Sure, Photobucket is great, but some people are perfectly capable of using thumbnails... why can't everyone?  It's not that hard...  Alright, that random rant is over now. :5  So yeah.  P9 show, Thursday, August 5.  Uh, its at my church, and its free.  There's another band there... And it's not really a 'show'... its more of us messing around, but hey, there'll be music!  So yeah... I'll let you know more about that when I know more.  Should be an intetresting show...  I'm out... beore I can do any more damage.  Oh, that rant isn't pointed at any of the journals I usually read... So it's not about your journal.  Just random ones.

       Today we had my Grandparents'  50th Annaversary party!  Yay!  Awesome lunch/dinner... and some interesting conversation.        David Flynn rocks because he is the #8 11-year old golfer in the world.  Yes, world.  :5      Not that you know him, but he's cool.  And he has a british accent!  It gets no cooler than that...      Hm... More thinking going on.  DZ and DJ come tomorrow morning... At 8.  Ugh.  And with my recent lack of sleep, I have hardly been at my best.  Ugh.      Thats how I am right now... ugh.      Got a new book at church: "The Truth About Same-Sex Marriage." by Erwin W. Lutzer.  I'm going to give it a read, hopefully to gain some new insight.      You know, Bush is one of the most hated presidents of our time.  Know why?  Because he is trying to uphold Biblical morals, and he is addressing problems at their roots.  Bam.  I   I'm out.
