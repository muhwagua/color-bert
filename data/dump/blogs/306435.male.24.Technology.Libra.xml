      Well, I am glad to see that Kristin updated her blog...about time is all I can say.   I can't wait for the weekend.  I can use the time off and the extra Monday off.  I have lots of sleep and laundry coming my way..plus Ann's house is throwing a Cowboy party this Saturday...it should be interesting!  I am not used to having this many plans...  Last night Ann and I went to Sitwells, a coffee shop in the Clifton area of Cincinnati.  We had a grand time.  She told me all about her improv group, Don't Tell Anna.  It was a fun time.  We talked for a while and sipped on our coffee.  I had a Turtle Mocha...I remember when Kate young first showed me Sitwells and I would not drink coffee at all.  I would always order the same think...Mexicocoa (a hot chocolate with vanilla and sugar).  Everytime Kate and T would offer me sips of their fabulous coffess.  Finally, I liked one...the Turtle Mocha.  I especially like it when I add sugar.  Ann had Chai Milkshake.  She let me have some and it was pretty good.  I can honestly say I am not a fan of Chai, but this drink had the slightest hint of cinnamon that made me thik of oatmeal with cinnamon in it.  It is funny things the digfferences that Ann and I have.  Television for one thing.  I love television.  I can watch three shows at one time easy.  Ann and television are not so much. One would think that would be a bad combination, but I thkn it is cool.  You don't always want to be with like people...then you have nothing to talk about.  **** WARNING ANN DO NOT READ *****  Fantasy Sports update:  At weeks beginning I was seven games behind Jim in the baseball fanatasy sports league and now I am only one game back.  I just need to earn two more points and I am playoff bound.  Put'em on the board YES!  Okay, Ann it is safe to read this...  I really have nothing else to talk about...until then...

      Wednesday, Wednesday Wednesday...what else can be said?  Tom turned 21 today...yipee!  He had a lot and I mean A LOT to drink last night.  Evididently he has taken up smoking...he started with NEWPORTS...now that is thugish right there.  Everyone started school yesterday...so things will hopefully turn into some sort of pattern and I can start to get more sleep.  I really don't have a ton to say, but knew I couldn't moan about Kristin not updating her blog if I didn't first...so Kristin...UPDATE YOUR BLOG!!!  Wow, I am really using the caps lock a lot today...heh?   Fantasy Sports update...right no w the Ivanhoe Riverbats (that is me) need to make up seven games on Jim to get into the playoffs.  I am currently three up on him with four days to go...one good game from Adam Dunn and the Riverbats are playoff bound.  Football starts soon...that will be fun.  WEhave 9 people which is great... and no girls which is better.  The fireworks for Labor Day weekend are coming up.  I am trrying to talk Ann into going....hopefully my family is coming up.  If so I am going to go to the Kentucky side and watch...  Okay I am out of things to talk about...until then...

      Well the party went off pretty well last night.  Lots of people showed up...with a little coaxing.  Luckily the party down the street ran out of goods and the crowd needed somewhere to go.  We successfully kept people out of the apartment, although many people tried to come in.  Tom seemed to be havig  a good time, and that was the important thing.   Justin seems to be getting closer and closer to getting the Jeep.  His brother Tony went to look at one on Sunday.  I haven't heard much about it other than it was "nice".  Kristin started her own  urlLink blog  so you can read up on that.   Ann and company start school tomorrow.  they are having a big Manresa party tonight. It will be interesting to see how things change once school starts. Nutzo got the axe today at work.  It was very sad and depressing, like Ann said "there is nothing worse than an out of work clown who has ADD!"  I packed up all his stuff for the TekSystem girls to pick up.  He had a lot of crap in his desk.  It is nice that Chris is moving up to taking calls though.   We didn't win the lottery...that is just as depressing. Well I am going to quit typing here...I have a lot todo...songs to download...cd's to make (I didnt forget Kristin!)  Until then...

      Quite the fun day for  Ryan.  My parents came and picked me up around 3:30.  We drove up to see the Michigan Battlecats take on the Dayton Dragons.  My friend Chris Burke plays shortstop for the Michigan Battlecats, the single A team for the Houston Astros.  Any way, we got up there around 5ish.  My mom, dad, sister Kelly, and brothers Colin and Matthew were all there.  We got in the building and found the entire Schulte family, and a ton of Burkes.  the game wa a scheduled double header.  In the minor leagues double headers are shortened to two seven inning games instead of the ususal nine.  Before the game I was a little anxious.  I am not sure why I played on the same team with him from third grade to my senior year in high school.  I always prided myself on not being someone who got intimidated by him.  When I saw him on the field I was impressed.  He looked like he belonged.  This is what he was meant to do.  he came over to here his family and friends were gathered.  I was up on the seond level, just sort of watching.  I didn't want to be one of the people who went running...that isn't pro. The cool thing was he looked up and found ne right away and yelled, "Hey what up Ryno!"  That was when I remembered that he wasn't the man, myth, and legend...he was my friend Chris.  He went off to stretch.  I watched the first game from a multitude of seats.  Dayton sells out every game so tickets were hard to come by.  Chris got hit with the first pitch of the game, he had a bunt single, a sac bunt, and then popped up.  As the teams took their thirty minute break, the clouds rolled in and so came the rain.  The rain chased most of the crowd away.  The Schultes left and the rest of us took seats behind the first base line.  I got to talk with everyone.  Mojo (Chris's mom) told us all sorts of stories.  We talked about the College World Series, signing day, being in the Astros locker room.  She also said that Chris does not have a computer...can you believe that?  The rain finally stopped.  By the end of the second game (I believe Chris 1-3 with a double and intentional walk that drew boos from our section of the stands) it was like we were in Louisville at a St. Matthews field.  Mr. Burke was hilarius.  The San Diego Chicken was at the first game, but the second game we witnessed the exploits of Roof Man.  Mr Burke started the "Jump!" chant.  My dad danced to Funk Soul Brother...and we pondered the how a man can not advance, but get a hit and an error on the same play...(it will hurt you if you thik about it too much).  The Battlecats won and remained a half game ahead in the standings.  Chris came out after the game.  I walked down with my brothers and he came right to me...he thanked me for coming and shook my hand.  Someone else (family I think) grabbed his attention..I started to walk away and he yelled "Ryno thanks for coming...I mean that".  while my brothers find it funny that I am Ryno to him...I found it cool that with all this hoopla that has been surrounding him, he went out of his way to say good-bye.    On the way back to Cincy my sister and I discussed the hitsof the day on the radio.  On the way up we heard "because I got High" by AfroMan.  It is quite the amusing song.  we also discussed the mulletts we saw during the day.  Dayton was very homogenius.  In fact I think I could count the non-white people I saw who were not int he game on one hand.  Tomorrow we are having Tom's 21st birthday party.  It should be fun...if not stressful.  Evidiently Tom is threatening to move bunnies to Chicago, or something...I am not sure.  You need to check out his page to find out.  His link is on my links page.  I say this because I am too tired to type out the html code to link you there directly right now.  Okay...that is all I have for now...I didn't get to see Ann today...so I need to work on that tomorrow..until then...

      Well, I didn't forget about updating (Kristin!) I have just been really busy.  I will now update you on the proceedings of the last few weeks.  Ann made a surprise appearence coming home Saturday night (two dayts early).  Her friends got elevation sickness and they decided to cu tthe trip short...no problem with me.  Sunday, Tom and Justin accompanied me to one of the most atrocious Reds games I have ever seen.  The best part of the game was a Wilton Guerrero infield single.  The best part of the day was when a mullett dude yelled for a security guard because a kid threw a sno-cone at him.  Later the three of us went to BW3's for Summer Slam.  I am not going to run down the card.  There are other places to find that info.  Instead I am going to tell you that we watched it with an old lady.  Justin for once...was weirded out.  It was great.  Tony from Addex was there.  That was cool.  I hadn't seen him for the longest time.  When he got fired from Addex we only heard stories, but it was rumored that he showed p the next mornign to confornt the lil terrorist Mark.    Monday I spent watching wrestling by myself (JUSTIN!!!)...you can read more about this experience on Tom's up and coming commentary on Bizzaro World.  Then Jsutin came home and we went to Dana's where we met up with the Gog' Guys and Ann....they were not together.  Nicole Roney made an appearance...she was with Claire and were celebrating 21st birthdays.    Tuesday not much happened.  In fact I don't remember Tuesday at all...    Wednesday..we went car shopping.  That is right.  Justin is going to buy a Jeep.  We played dont let the car salesman tok to you game.  We would park and walk with confidence.  Justin would write down info and when someone came up we would walk the other way...it was great.  Later that night I officially met Elizabeth, Ann's roomate.  That puts two down with two to go.  Rol and Kristin were there.  We watched Leno...  Thursday...I spent most of Thursday working on a cd or both Ann and Kristin.  I am having no trouble finding sonns for Kristin...I knoiw what she likes.  I know what she doesn't like, and I know what she needs to listen to (more Ma$e!).  She will like what ever I send her as long as her three songs are on there.  Ann on the other hand is different.  True she will probably like whatever I do...but I want her to REALLY like it.  I have found about 6 solid songs so far.  Everything I listen just doesn't seem cool enough for her...anyway...  Kristin, I hope this suffices you.  Please, edit...  Until next time...

      I did absolutely nothing last night.  Well, I take that back, I talked to Kristin for a long time online, but other than that I did absolutely nothing.  It is funny how Kristin and I have developed such a deep relationship over the internet.  I think that bothers her.  She studied a lot about communication in school, and thinks that Email/Instant Messaging is one of the poorest forms of communication.  The thing is I have gotten to know more about her over the last four and a half years through constant email and IMs than any other person I know.  She just started a new job in Louisville this past week at the Associated Press.  She now works in the same building with my dad.  At one time this would have upset me, my worlds colliding like that, but I am okay with it now.  I guess that is a sign of my maturity.  Anyway at her new job she spends Friday and Saturday nights taking the scores of high school football games over the phone, which I believe she then publishes on the AP Wire (if I am wrong I know she will correct me....that is what she does for a living).  So the two hours that the games are going on she just waits by the phone.  She got on AOL and we talked for a time.  Justin and I went to First watch for brunch this morning.  He had some fruity thing and I had french toas, it was good.  While waiting the half hour for a table we stopped by the book store.  I found two boooks by JD Salinger that I have never read.  I think I am going to stop by the library and see if I can get one of them.  They were only in hard back at the store, and I didn't have the thirty bucks to buy one.  I flipped through a copy of  Nine Storeis  which reminded me I need to get my copy back from Cara (cough).  When we got back I had a post card from Ann waiting.  She has been in Idaho for the past week.  She said she is having a good time.  Evidently they had to cut there 40 mile journey off for health reasons (didn't explain much more than that), but they were having fun in the city.  She should be home late Sunday/early Monday.  I can't wait for her to get back.    I am not sure what the plans are for tonight.  I am sure Justin has something up his sleeve...of course I thought that last night too.  He is off RolePlaying at Lances house (yes I said Lance...it weirded me out too), but he should be back soon.  Tomorrow we are hitting the Red's game and then the WWF PPV Summer Slam with Tom.  Until then...

      Well I have to say I was impressed by the show last night.  The Roots know how to put on a good show.  I was a little skeptical before the show, with quite ecclectic crowd.  We saw some break dancers performing, that ended up on the stage during the local warm up band.  Then The Roots were on.  They came out and the corwd got huge.  The place was sold out!  They opened with a set of their new stuff and then morphed into some older stuff.  Then after Black Thought had to leave (evidently he was sick and the smoke was getting to him), the rest of the crew blew up.  ?eustlove started off with a 10 minute drum solo that knocked the socks off the crowd.  Zack De La Rocha (formlerly of Rage Against the Machine) then took off with his lead guitar.  He Performing Iron Maiden and then topping it with Nirvana's  Smells Like Teen Spirit  that had the crowd rocking out!  Then came Kamal on the keyboard.  He took the crowd on a trip through classic hip hop with some Salt-n-Peppa and other way back 80's hits.  Then Scratch came back in the scene and took it 1986 style.  The vocal turntabelist threw down some Run DMC with the help of ?eustlove.  It was bad..."not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning GOOD!" So I was impressed.  The crowd was live, except for the kid who got high and passed out.  And I had a good time.  I plan on getting the Roots cd this weekend.  Beyond that not much else is going on.  I am missing Ann, but that was expected.  Justin and Tom hate my hair, again....expected.  Wrestling is on tonight, so finally a little normality in my life.  Until then...

      Middle of the week.  I hate the middle of the week.  Nothing is on TV.  The previous weekend is so long ago, and the up coming weekend is just as far the other way.  Listen to me being all dramatic.  The roomate, Justin came back home last night.  His hair is longer and we went up to the local pub, Dana's, and he told us his stories from his grand trip to Gonzaga. He went to the emergency room again.  I think he tries to go to the emergency room in every city he visits.  Tonight we are going to see  urlLink The Roots  play.  It should be fun.  I was speaking to Lyle last night and evidently the St. Lunatics are the hottest things coming.  I downloaded an mp3 last night, but have yet to have a chance to listen.  I am sure it will be "kick'n".  Well that is all for now.  I will be back with my thoughts on the show tomorrow.

      So the weekend went pretty well.  After my exploits with hair dye on Friday night, the rest of the weekend was fairly calm.  Saturday I vegged out for awhile until I went to the Reds.  They were playing the Rockies, but even cooler were the seats we had.  I went with my Uncle who got tickets with a corporate outing.  We had free food the whole game.  Weird was that my 10 year old cousin Adam decided that he needed popcorn, and left the free food area to track some down.  In the end the Reds won and we escaped the rain, so it was a good night.  Sunday I spent cleaning the apartment.  It is amazing how much you can get done when no one else is around.  About 10:00 Jeff invited me up for a rousing game of Great Delmute'.  Okay, okay, it wasn;t the rousing game I have talked it up to be, but I did weird Devon out with my hair.  Ah, I love my hair now.

      So the big news is Ryan dyed his hair.  That is right, you are now reading the blonde Ryan.  In 100 years it will mean nothing, but for me it is a big deal.  I thinkn I am going to try the spikey look.  Go with something new.

      Well, I have had quite the weekend.  Friday I watched UFC at Tom's house with his brother, his dad, and Justin...it was good.  By the time we got home though my stomach was a mess...I felt so bad.  The good news is that when I woke up Saturday it felt much better.  Ann had gone to Indy with Elizabeth Friday and they came back with a legit car load of food.  They had a bunch of people over for a get together and it was nice.  Later we went to a Xavier gathering and then to Dana's...all in all it was good.  Sunday my parents came up and brought me this cool new monitor.  It is really nice.  I no longer have to squint.  We also went to see my grandma and then went to LaRossa's for dinner.  I love hanging out with my family.  Everything is just so much funnier when they are around.  Well I am off to Mass for tonight...until then...

      It sucks when you don't feel good on your birthday.  I have a monster headache and my stomach is none to happy with me right now.  I am at work, so that may have something to do with it.  It has been nice getting birthday messages from people...Mrs. Schulte, Father Heim, my mom, and Ann.  I hope when I get home I can take a nap and wake up a little more refreshed. Oh well...I am sure I will have more to say later...

      So I have had a pretty good week so far.  Ann and I went on what I would call a date.  We planned going out and then did.  We went to Arthur's in Hyde Park.  We were on a search for a REAL bowl of chili.  You know the kind based off of a tomato.  Not that their is anything wrong with Cincy style chili, I just really wanted some home style chili.  I would have given anything for my mom's chili and Arthur's came pretty close.  So Ann got a burger and I got a cup of chilli and a turkey sandwich...it was soooo good!  It was the perfect thing for a cold Fall night.  Later, Ann and I came back and watched some tv.  Tonight, Ann and I went to Pane e Vino with Jeff and Devon.  It was cool to have such a grown up type dinner.  We all happened to be dressed up which made us feel important.  I had some good tortallini...  I cleaned the kitchen tonight...man it needed cleaning.  I pretty much cleaned the whole thing...I am not the greatest cleaner, but man it is clean now.  Okay, I don't have too much more to say...until then...

      I would have to say that the weekend went pretty well.  First, and foremost, St. X defeated Trinity 14-7...(did you get that Kristin, St. X 14 Trinity 7...yeah I am mocking you).  I got to hang out with my family including my dad, which surprised me because he usually is not off on Fridays.  I go to introduce Ann to everyone...and introduce everyone to Ann.  I got to tease Kelly.  Eat lunch with Jaclyn, Kristin, and Cara (yes she brought the book back).  Then I get home Sunday and the Bengals go 2-0 beating the defending Super Bowl champs (bizarro world) then I spent the night watching ppv wrestling...doesn't get better, heh?

      St. X Trinity game...ahhh the memories. Mine go back way farther than the four years I attended the great St. Xavier high school.  I am lucky enough to have a birthday near the scheduled game every year.  I remember my first attendance game during my sixth grade year at St. Albert.  I had learned of the rivalry earlier in the week when Chris Burke made a full fledged appeal to get fellow classmates to cheer for the green and gold..."my brother is going to play baseball there" were the winning words that got me on his side.  My uncl, Greg, and cousins Chuck (St.X class of '00) and Michael went to the game.  I was amazed.  So many people.    The next year I was fully St. X equipped.  I had my St.X baseball cap (which was often mistaken for a Malcolm X hat) and watched the game.  Cincy Carrero was a machine and Miguel Montano was quick as lightning.  They went on to win the state championship that year.  That year was also the year that we lost Sean.  He was supposed to meet us at the car after the game.  he didn't.  We drove around for an hour until we found him by the stables...no wonder he went to Trinity...  Eigth grade was the year my football team lost all but one game.  Chip Mattingly and Trip Williams were are anchors on defense and Wes Whitworth was hittingn his prime as a reciever.  When the toy bowl got postponed we had the greatest week of practice ever...well until Coach Wagner (shamed to say who now coaches the Shamrocks himself) had his son Tony (St.X grad '96) dress in hi sfootball gear.  Tony knocked the living snot out of me...before coach could run him off the field he yelled "that is how it will be next year when he is playing for the Tigers!"    Boy was he right...baseball was my first love, but football was my most challenging sport.  Baseball came easy.  Football took full concentration.  I was and am stil not a big guy.  I had to play smart if I wanted to stay alive.  I rememeber one time when Bernard Jackson and Joe Jackson hit me as hard as the time Tony hit me in eight grade...only this time I caught and held onto the ball....Coach Johnson about flipped his lid...well he always flipped his lid...but this time he was happy.  Well we beat Trinity that fall..in fact we went undefeated and won the city freshman title.  Our seniors were not so lucky as I recall.  The next three years I cheered from the sidelines...joining in the group cheers.  I really enjoyed the big games...everyone cheering for the green and gold.  Usually everyone was freezing cold and horse by the end...but we had fun.  Well...I can't wait for the game...I'll have an update on the score then..until then...

      Ann has decided to come home with me this weekend...I am excited.  It should be fun.  I am working the early shift on Friday so I can get home sooner.  Ann has to give a presentation at 4:00 so we will probably leave right after that.      I hate Norton AntiVirus.  It is a nice program and all, but man is it slow.  I work for a help desk and everytime a virus alert comes out the next day we get a ton of calls, because Norton's is making the computer run slow.  You would think that making users not have to do work would be a good thing...but none the less.  Saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back... it  was a pretty entertaining movie.  I love when movies have background stories and this one was a king of having background stories.  Characters from Clerks, Chasing Amy (still yet to see but want to) and Mall Rats (the kid is on the escalator again!) all make up this very eclectic cast.  Sometimes Justin reminds me of Jay...obnoxious, yet it is not bad having him around.  I could see Tom and Justin as a good Jay and Silent Bob combo....or Nic and Lyle.  I have been reading up on the films and stuff that Kevin Smith says.  He seems to be a very intelligent guy.  It is funny, because most of the stuff in the films are based on real people or events...well maybe no the diamond heist, but you know what I mean.  It is said there are plans for a cartoon version of mall rats to come out...I am not sure how that will work.  The cartoon version of Clerks was well...not good.  Okay...not much else to say...Kritin?  No mocking in this one...until then...

      My work day ends in ten minutes, so I am going to use that time to update my blog.  Today was very rainy.  I am not really a big fan of rainy days, but feel they are needed every once in awhile.  Wow here I am talking about the weather...who am I  urlLink Kristin ?    I am going to be going hom ethis weekend...I am trying to talk Ann in to coming.  She is a little nervous.  I can understand that...I mean the position of meeting your girlfriend/boyfriends parents for te first time can be intimidating.  I hope she is not though.  Anyway we are going to go to the St. X Trinity football game.  It should be fun.  Other than that not much else is going on...until then..

      Well it has been a couple days now for me to digest what has gone on in New York and D.C....I am not really sure I know what to think of it.  The day it happened I was kind of in shock.  I heard a bit of disturbance on the radio as I got out of my car going into work at 9:00.  When I was inside the office and heard people tlaking of two planes crashing in New York.  I didn't think much about it at first...not until I heard "they hit the Pentagon!"  I kept up with my job, but was severly numb.  I have never gone through anything like this.  The closest thing for me would be the Gulf War which took place while I was in the sixth grade...all of which seemed to much like a movie.  In fact the scenes I saw later that day were much like thatof a movie, only this time there was no hero running to the plane's cockpit to eventually win out.   I have been very interested in the proceedings over the last few days.  How people react and why they react to something.  I was very glad my mom called me while I was at work.  That was very comforting. I am going home next weekend.  THe big St. X Trinity game is on the horizon.  It should be fun.  I am not sure if Ann is going to come or not.   She is gladly invited and it would give all the people in Louisville a chance to meet her...especially Kristin who does nothing nbut ask about her...  Other than that not too much more has been going on...  Until then...

      Compliments are nice.  It is amazing how they can make people feel so good.  Nothing to them really.  Just a "nice hair" or a "I like your dress".  It is those little things that make a day.

      Okay time to play catch up on the blog...  This weekend was pretty damn fun.  Ann's party, which I came to find out was on Friday not Saturday, was a blast.  Cowboys and girls galore.   urlLink Jeff Kinne  had the best costume of the night with his Peruvian Cowboy Outfit.  Other than the random act of tearing up of magazines (so lame) and the breaking of Jeff Kinne's gun, the night was a blast.  By far the highlight was Dwayne the Norrwoodian hunk.  He randomly showed up to the party and made himself at home.  Dwayn then proceeded to use the weather to hit on girls, challenge Kristin to a friendship dual, urinate in the basement, and then be escorted out.   Saturday was relaxing.  Waking up at noon any day makes it relaxing.  Saturday night I went to a Kareoke night at Sorrento's.  It was lined up to be really fun, but little did we know that the evil Vince and his microphone bullies were going to be there.  (Vince was a +40 man with a gray flat top that the lady frunning the show seemed to have a thing for.  He would sing a song, drink a beer, and then sing a song again.  Ooooh you don't want to see potential kareokeers scorned.  Vince heard it from the boo birds by the ned of the night.  Eventually we had people sign up with Vince just so they could get a chance to sing... Sunday was firework night.  Well, we watched the last 3 minutes on television.    Ann's house hosted a wonderful grill out.  James mastered the one flip burger and Justin learned how to sit in a hammock.   Monday I continued to lounge until Ann and I rode to Eden Park on bicycles.  What was I thinking!?!  Well I made it there and back and have the craving to watch RAD the movie now. Well that was my weekend...until then...

      Well work was pretty fun today.  It being halloween, we dressed up as a group.  We dressed in the theme of ER.  We had hospital scrubs for everyone, except for Joe and Ryan M. who were patieents.  We won the group outfit award and a gift certificate for a pizza party (just typing that made me feel like I was in third grade).  Anyway the kids from the preschool across the street came through and got candy.  It was pretty fun.  I will have pictures up soon.    We have a puzzle at work now that I am on a mission to complete.    Okay, well  urlLink Dawson's  is on tonight...so I am going to get going...until then...

      Hey I am using this tool called  urlLink Blog buddy .  It is pretty cool.  Not too much went on this weekend.  I was glad to get the extra sleep this weekend.  I am watching  urlLink  Smallville   while typing this so it may be a little scatter in thought...  Halloween is tomorrow.  The pumpkins on the fromt porch has lasted two weeks and I for one is very impressed.  I thought for sure they would have been smashed 24 hours into the first weekend.  We are dressing up for work tomorrow.  Dave got us all doctor scrubs and lab coats.  We are going to be an ER, which I think is quite fitting in the computer scheme of things, but then again I am a geek.  Things at work are getting better with the new seat.  I feel like more of the team now, but I miss talking to Sue all day.  I went and saw "Don't Tell Anna" this weekend and then Ann had everyone over for a party.  It was a very fun party.  Ann has a very unique talent for meeting and getting to know really interesting and cool people.  I really like that about her...  So this would be a good time to send a shout out to our newest readers Judy, Ed and Eddie...well I guess they could read it to Eddie.    I haven't heard rom Kristin in awhile.  I have tried to stay active online so I could talk to her.  She is probably pretty busy.  She did update her  urlLink blog , but I didn't understand the post at all (ahmmm...that means Kristin send me an email)...  Okay, I am going to go finish watching Smallville...until then...

      Whoo...who!!!  Figured out how to get my archives back...I was worried for a minute.  Not much going on around here.  I can say I love the show  Smallville .  It is a very well done show.  Tonight Dawson's is on so that should be great.  I think the World Series is on tonight too.  Not much else going on, but I know I have to update my blog because Kristin will jump on my case if I don't.  Evidently bad weather is coming ito the area in like 30 minuites...whatever!  I t looks great outside (man here I am talking about the weather again!)...  Well I am going to be home alone tonight for awhile, so my page will probably have something new on it...until then...

      A pretty calm Sunday around these parts.  Listened to the Bengals lose while cleaning in the kitchen and then cleaning in my room.  It seems Ann's group won the XU programing contest with out her so that is cool...way to go Devon.  Not much to say...I am working on a cast of characters section of my page with backgrounds of all the people I write about here....this way if you have any questions on my references you can check it out there.  Okay...time to watch baseball...until then

      I just had the craziest time at the Kroger near my house (we call it the KroGhetto around these parts).  I went shopping for  bread, chicken, hawain punch, ice cream...you know the basics.  So I was shopping for maybe ten minutes getting mostly on sale items.  I then got in line.  Well I was there for 20 as the lady in front of me was having a terrible time.  She was trying to get three boxes of cereal on sale for $5.  Well it was ringin up at normal price....so the manager took her back in the store and howed her that she was getting the wrong box.  hen we come to find out it is 2 for $5.  Oh what a mess.  Everytime they tried to move her to the side to let me in she would start to whine about how "you people need to work on your courtesy".  I swear, then her daughter came over and started yelling.  If they would have calmed down they would have realized the manager was trying to help them...  And to top it off Ann called while I was away...she got home okay...so that is good.

      Wow you don't post for three days and Kristin gets on your case.    Well Friday I had a blast at  urlLink Tom's Maze .  I went with the XU Computer Science Club.  It was pret muddy, but extremely fun.  We had to go through 12 sections and find map pieces before leaving the maze.  I am not usre how long we were in there, but I would guess two hours.  Devon and Stacey even got their picture with Tom himself.    When we got home Ann had a message to call her mom.  It was bad news as her Great Aunt Alice had passed away earlier in the day.  Ann was pretty upset.  This is the second person I know who has lost someone close.  So I drove her to the airport this morning. She went back for the funeral and will be back on Monday night.  I will miss her, but I am glad she is getting to be with her family.  They will be in my prayers.  Okay, well I dont have much else on my mind...if I do I'll post...until then...

      It was soooo cold today.  Wind and rain ...just yuck, that is all I can say about it.  Other then that things are going pretty well.  I switched desks today at work.  Now I am out in the open.  It is neat to change perspective, but I wish I was still sitting by Sue...I just don't like change. The show Smallville is pretty cool.  I watched it tonight.  I also went to Sitwells with Ann and Kristin W. ... it was cool.  I had a Turtle Mocha, it was the best one I have ever had.  Kristin had never been before...so it was cool that she got to go.  I always think of Kate when I go...especially when Ann thinks about ordering humuss...yuck. I hope Kristin Hill is doing okay...I didnt see her online today.  I know she is okay though, she has her family with her and that is all that really matters. Well, that is all I really have to say tonight...not that I ever have to say anything...until next time...

      With the ability to get to my page hampered at the moment, I have not had too much want to post, but alas I will.  I have been putting most of my posting power towards cincymusic.com (I suggest checking this page out).    I am keeping Kristin and her family in my prayers.  Her grandmother passed away today.  That is a tough situation.  It is not easy to lose someone close to you...  On a lighter note the Bengals won today.  They are 3-2.  I am kicking butt in fantasy football.  The MLB Playoffs are going well...and are getting more and more interesting (I am rooting against the Yankees).   I got a hair cut this weekend.  My what used to be blonde hair is now being over powered by the brown hair and it looks like I have a bad frost job...but that is okay.  I saw Zoolander with Ann and Elizabeth this weekend. That is one weird movie.  It had some good moments, but it had some "what were they smoking when they wrote this" moments too.  Justi's hair is getting long.  Too long.  Okay, well I am on Ann's computer and Elizabeth wants to use it to check her email...so until then...

      Well, my web page is down.  Okay, so it is not really my web page that is down, but the cool name that it has.  RYAN.RULES.IT I mean how much cooler can you get? Well the "has.it" guys shut down the free service because some people were abusing the system.  I read the all the info and I am pretty sure I am not abusing it.  You can reach my page (somehow you made it here!)  urlLink www.members.tripod.com/cwfldk   On to the good news!  Ms. Ann turned 22 yesterday.  I made her some cup cakes.  I am pretty proud of my first cup cake venture.  Also, Dawson's Creek and West Wing start tonight.    I don't have too much else to say.  I change desks at work some time soon.  I guess that will be fun.

      Hey everybody!...okay, okay...I know very few people read this, but it feels nice knowing that it is possible for many people to read it.  So things with me are going pretty well.  I have'nt actually done much at all this weekend...and it feels good.  Every once in awhile nothing is exactly what needs to be done.  Well to be honest I did do quite a few things.  Wednesday after Ann called, I went to Dana's urlLink   with her roomates and had a blast.  Thursday I worked later then usual and with the heavier traffic didn't get home til 6:00.  It is a shame too because Maressa and Carol had invited me to go to dinner with them.  I did watch all m shows though.  Hey speaking of Thursday night must see tv....the show Inside Schwartz has a Ryan connection....okay so it is not a huge one, but better than most.  The ex-girlfriend in the show is Maggie  Lawson was a frequent follower of the St. X way of life.  From what I know she dated Chris Burke and her brother was two years below me on the baseball team.  Maggie was also our local Fox Kids announcer.    Friday I hung out with Tom and we watched Brain Candy by Kids in the Hall and the allustrious Big labowski, which I may say to Mr. Matera (who probably will never read this) was not as good as it had been built up.  I mean it was just a story about Dude.  I mean how good can that really be.  Justin got back today.  His hair is really long now.  He looks very creepy.    Ann comes home tomorrow.  I miss her.  I am talkig to her on IM right now.  I miss her a lot.  It is funny how three months ago things were so different.  Now I can't seem to not think about her everyday.   weird huh?    okay I am done for the night...until then

      Today wasn't so bad.  My Uncle C.H. called me at work asking for computer help, which is okay because I do work at a computer help desk, but I will be able to fix it when I go home this weekend for our pseudo Thanksgiving.  I am kind of bummed that Ann will not be able to come down.  She has a big exam and then the regional programming contest.   Okay, well, I am going to get some rest.  this first week of early mornign work is starting to get to me...my body will catch up soon...until then...

      yeah yeah...haven't updated in awhile...well if it is bothering you send me an email or post on my comment board.  I have started a new shift at work.  8-4:30.  i don't like waking up that early in the morning, but I have found getting home earlier makes me do stuff when I get back from work.   The Bob Dylan concert was cool.  I have already found a bunch of the songs he sang last night on MP3 form live from this tour.  So that is cool.  I wish I could pull off all white suits and white cowboy boots like he did. I was really sick this weekend.  I slept most of Saturday and a good portion of Sunday.  I guess it would be "cool" to be sleeping off a hang over, but I was sleeping of sinus problems.   I had a good time with a bunch of peeps at McKlenberg (sp?).  It is a German bar (owned by my landlord last year...like he was my landlord last year, not that he owned it...like it matters you understand what I am trying to say) in the UC part of the city.    I split some fries with Ann and Mike Matera and the Christian Morleins is a very good locally brewed beer.  okay...well I am going over to Ann's cause she is going to make me some pasta...yum yum...until then...

      Ahhh...Thursday.  Pretty good day to day.  i love that phrase "day to day".  It makes me think of the Seinfeld episode where Jerry is going to get married and Kramer is talking him out of it.  He says, "you can forget about eating dinner in front of the television.  You have dinner time and you have to talk about your day.  How was your day to day?  Fine how was your day to day?"  A classic I tell ya.  I helped Ann, Jeff, Devon, and Stacey make the CS Banner for the Home Coming parade today.  It was pretty fun.  Tomorrow is pay day.  I think I need to write my land lord an email.  I have toured three groups today, all sating that the land lord told them they could stop by.  This is ridiculous.  I mean by law I should get 24 hours notice, but more importantly I get nothing for "selling" the apartment.  I mean I don't want to be a jerk, but I am watching tv I dont want to show you around.  Okay...don't have much here...until then..oh yeah check out the new pics I added to the urlLink  page

      Ah, yes.  You probably thought I  had forgotten to update this thing didn't you?  Well, I didn't.  Things have been going pretty well with me.  I have tried to change the look of my web page.  For some reason my page will not load on some computers.  I am not sure why yet.  I think it my be the size of the picture on the first page, but we will soon see.  My work got hit by the goner virus yesterday.  It was kind of cool to catch it early and watch the company react to the news.  At the help desk we stayed pretty calm and informed everyone and for the most part the users were pretty calm.  I think most of them felt stupid for opening an attatchment that had been sent to them 6 times by 6 people  who they don't even know.  Eventually the Lotus Notes servers were shut down becasaue two of the offices we work with are on exchange servers and well if you know what that means then you know we were getting tons of emails.  Things were better today, but remnents of the virus were out there on computers with users that had no clue why their machine was going so slow.  Okay, well I am glad it is December, but even happier about it still being 70 degrees in December.  But as one of my callers, Dave Marr, suggested today (please read in a Scottish accent), "it just means we are goigng to have a bitterly cold February."  Mr. Marr I hope you are not right.  Okay, I am off to bed.  Another week of the late shift.  For those of you keeping track, and I know there are a ton of you keeping track, Ben is quitting and taking a job in Toledo so I am on the late shift until someone else is good enough to stay late.  Okay...good night...

      Congratulations are due for Greg and Kristin... my best wishes to the two of you.  I remember the first time Kristin introduced Greg to me.  It was the infamous night of "The Horse Whisper".  Any way for some reason I can't think of right now, I know that Greg and I spent an uncomfortable ten minutes standing in the parking lot of a shopping center waiting for kristin to come back...that is not a slight on Greg, I just remember being very uncomfortable, maybe that is just the memory of "The Horse Whisper".    I have learned a lot about Greg since then from the ramblings of Kristin over the last couple of years and I know that they will live a happy and loving life together..

      Things have been going really good lately.  The weekend was fun.  Friday after work I met up with Ann and her roomates at the Montgomery Inn Boathouse.  That is a fun plave and they had really great snacks.  Then wew went up to Dana's and got there just in time because it soon got packed.  Saturday, I finally got my Ohio Drivers liscense.  It was fun taking the written test.  I was in between two 16 year olds and they were freaking out with every question.  I hadn't studied at all, but I know my skills from the SAT's came in very handy.  I think they should teach SAT taking skills freshman year in high school so everyone has a better chance at passing the driving test...  The lines were long and boring, just like on television, which is weird because I had never had that problem in Jefferson County offices.  Saturday night we watched the football game next at Ann's next door neighbor's house.  They had a mixology chart and were all about making mixed drinks for everyone.    Today, Ann and I went to a multi-faith Church Service downtown.  It was pretty cool.  I felt like I was in the churc scene in Blues Brothers and expected full out dancing and flips, but alas there were none.  OH AND GET THIS...No PPV at BW3'S tonight...WHAT UP WIT THAT?  Evidently there was a contractual problem with WWF, Direct TV or BW3's...I didn't stay long enough to find out, the wings are good enough to watch free wrestling to, but not to stay and watch pre football shows.  That is all I have for now...

      Have you ever leaned back in your chair at work and looked at the ceiling, only to see the fire extinguisher and exit signs as the tallest thing in the room?

      Okay, I am seriously out of ideas for my web page...does anyone have any good ideas?   Work has been super busy.  Double your possible users and then tell all the users that they have to use (create new user IDs and passwords) a brand new application by Wednesday and it will tend to get busy.  It is so busy that somtimes I find myself not caring that someone is on the line waiting, something I never ever would let happen in the past.  We lose another one on Friday as Scottie is leaving to take a job in Southern Illinois.  I dont think he understands how far away Southern Illinois is.   It has been fun having Ann back in town.  I have a lto more stuff to do when she is around.  She yed her hair two nights ago.  it looks an awesome maroon color.  My hair is getting a little long now.  not near as long as Justin's but my sideburns are much cooler looking...atleast I think so.

      Not too exciting of a week.  Work has been really really busy.  I have also proved my superiority over Justin in fanatasy and N64 football.  I wwon our Fantasy Bowl as well as the Madden 2002 Super Bowl.  I have also been advised that Jackie would like a shout out.  Evidently she was wondering why Tanner would get some PR and she wouldn't...well I was protecting her from having to tell the story of her and Tanner making out, but oh well here is your pub.  Ann comes back to the Nati on Friday.  That is very exciting.    Oky...I am running out of things to write. If you think of something you want on my page let me know.

      Well, I am back from up north and I had quite a fun time.  Chicago was very cool to see.  I missed an exit on the way to the Art Museum (where I was meeting Ann and her family) and was able to navigate my way tere.  I was proud of that. Milwaukee was good, but seeing Ann was the best part.  I got to meet her parents, sister and a few friends.  One of the highlights was the persuaing of a VP at Fortis to buy us a round on New Years Eve.  Oh, and I cannot forget about the dance stylings of the one and only Tanner and his Green Bay jacket. Okay, I will try to update more likely.

      I went to Mrs. Greaves funeral today.  I went with Justin, Jim, Kristen, Lyle, and Nic.  It was nice service.  The Funeral Choir was quite a trip.  There was a man in it who sang by just talking louder than normal.  He later came up to Jim and started to talking to him aout having to push a pebble with his nose across a street.  Confused?  So was Jim.  Tom seemed to be doing pretty well, or as well as one could expect.  We are gon to go out him Friday.  it should be fun.  I hadn't hung out with all of them in a while.  I am looking forward to it.    Tom informed me he bought American Movie on DVD.  I advise watching the movie.  You'll spend te first half trying to figure out if it is real and the second part trying not to laugh so you can hear the dialouge.  That is all I really have here...I am woring on the  urlLink web page  and hope to have new stuff daily.

      I had a pretty good weekend.  I went to Oberlin, Ohio.  An's firend Susie goes to school there.  We went up on Friday and ittook forever.  It seems our directions were a little off.  We went about an hour and a half out of are way almost going all the way to the Cleveland.    We finally got there and met up with Susie.  She was working at  urlLink College Lanes  (Oberlin's eight lane bowling alley).   We played a few games and then headed over to  urlLink Finney Chapel  for the Oragan Pump.  One midnight a month organists play the huge pipe organs in a casual atmosphere.  We got to go up and lay on the stage and feel the vibrations.    Saturday we watched Susies improv group perform and then headed over to downtown Oberlin.  later that night we saw  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  perform.  It was a cool performance.    urlLink Teddy Thompson  opened and the atmosphere was very laid back becasue Rufus' sister goes to Oberlin.    Susie's house had a party that night.  It was odd and I think I will leave it at that...  Okay back to the regular week...

      So, I was reading  urlLink Kristin's blog  tonight and she linked to mine.  Then I realized that I have not updated in awhile...maybe that is why no one is signing my guest book?  Anyway I have had a real good past week.  It was very busy weekend.  It started with a very quick day at work.  I had to pack up my stuff all week for our big office move to the third floor.  We are moving to the third floor while they rearrange the cubes and lay down new carpet.  Well, after work I came home and picked up and  urlLink Ann  and we were off to Louisville.  We got into town about 6:15ish and headed straight to the fish fry at St. Albert's.  I think Ann wasimpressed with the size of the event.  It is pretty impressive.  There we met up with Colin and Matt.  After dinner we went home and played a rousing game of Cranium.  Saturday Ann went shopping with my mom and aunt Julie.  I played X-box with Shane and Brandon too.  later that evening I went to my grandfather's wedding.  It was nice.  Kind of creepy, but I guess that is just something I will have to get used to.  I played do you remember their name game with Ann. The reception was nice except the keyboardist was playing very slow slow songs.  Finally he kicked it up a notch and put in a 70's dance music tape and we had a blast.  Sunday we went to mass and then had lunch at kristin's.  You can read all about it at Kristin's blog (linked above).  It was really good although Ann was sad that we forgot to eat the rice krispee treats.  I think Kristin should come visit and bring them up. (wink, wink)...  This weekend I am goin to go with Ann up to Oberlein (sp?) College to visit her friend  urlLink Susie.   She works at a bowling alley and i you know me and you know you do...I love bowling!  Okay I thkn that is all I have for now...

      Okay...so you are probably hanging on edge.  It came out okay.  It was good, but didn't slice as nicely as I had hoped.  I wanted to be able to pick it apart.  I think if I would have had better tools it would have been a little better, but hey not bad for a first try.

      Well, last night this so called ead cold unleashed all of its power on me.  I couldn't breathe from my nose and I had stuff runing down my throat.  Plus I felt like I had a night club pouding in the front of my head.  I slept as soon as I came home from work.  That wasn;t good because I was up the rest of the night.  Tom was over so I felt bad that I was just laying motionless ont he couch.    I feel better now.  I am going to go buy the ingridients for a pot roast tonight.  I watched them make on on Good Eats (a show on FoodTV).  It looked easy.  I will give it a shot tonight so it will be ready for tomorrow.  That is all from here.  Ann will be back in 48 hours so I am gettig excited....  Until then....

      I think Kristin gave me her head cold through an email.  I took two alaselzer plu that Torey gave me and it feels a little better.  It should work because it tastes nasty.  I thikn any medicine that tastes nasty should only have to be taken once.  I got my pager back yesterday.  Wednesday it just sort of beepe and died on me.  No biggie I guess.  They sent a new one and I sent the old one back.    Didn't do too much yesterday.  Watched Survivor (yes, I taped it for you Ann).  I took a nap yesterday too.  I hate taking naps during the day.  I never feel rested the next night.   Man my head is starting to hurt again...

Does anyone realize the amount of Kristin's I know now.  Three.  Can you believe it.  It is like being in grade school again with the like six girls named Sarah...totally.

      Hey folks,  Ann said I needed to update this so I am going to do that now.  An is in Europe right now on Spring Break.  I believe as I am writing this she is in Lithuania.    Things have been slow around here while everyone is gone.  I had a baseball meeting on Saturday that was very disappointing.  The fact that there was a meeting was great. My manager General (yep that is his first name) was very enthusiastic.  He seemed very excited.  I just wish someone other than myself had shown up.  I feel like I helped make so many deciddions that i should get an assistant coach title.  I feel I know more about the game than him, just fom the talk, but we will see.  It may be I am just confident in what I know from being around the game for so long.  Anyway, no one else showed up for themeeting so hopefully we can get a team together to spend the $1000 that was donated by sponsors (who don't even want to have the team named after them can you believe it?).  Sunday I had dinner with Kristin Wiley (check the cast of characters), here sister Jill, and Jill's HS friend. It was fun. It was nice to see people.  Kristin is always great because we have the exact same since of humor...(Hi, I am Dr. Scholl I will be your Dentist today...that was for you Kristin).  Monday I chilled by myself and Tuesday I hung out with Tom.  we went to the minor league wrestling sho here in Cincinnati.  It was fun.  Then we came back to the apartment and had pizza.  Justin came home two days early and pretty much threw his stuff around ta aprtment which stunk to high heaven.  Sometimes I think he cannot smell himself.  Anyway he was not really in a good mood.    I plan to hang out Kristin again tomorrow.  We are going to eat dinner and watcha movie(s).  Sloppy Trish has also been invited over.  I hope she comes.  I hope Ann gets home soon (wink wink - I know she is reading this, but I am not doing this for bonus points, I swear).  I miss her greatly and cannot wait for her to get back.  I am glad she is having a good time in all her world traveling....  so I will try to keep updated...hopefully a schedule will come soon for baseball...

      Back from Chicago...  We went to urlLink  Argonne National Laboratory  and stayed in the  urlLink Guest House .  I think the most facinating thing aout the place is how we were all so interested int he tv station that showed the  urlLink beam information  thorughout the night.  It was like watching a car wreck.  We played cards and had the Beam Station on.  I think Bill stayed up all night just making sure it didn't dip too much.  Anywat, Saturday night we walked aimlessly around town in freezing weather looking fpr a place to eat.  It was fun.  we eventually ound this little bar a grill called Govenor's.  It was okay.  Although I do know now why it is the windy city.  we rode the train into and out of town.  It was fun.  I took pictures and should have them up soon.  Sunday we went to the  urlLink Museum of Science and Industry .  It was way too big for the little time we had there.  There was a neat urlLink  History of Hip Hop exihibit    Ann and I scratched a few beats.  We also saw the  urlLink Human Body  OmniMax presentation.    It was very interesting.    We rode to and from Chicago in two twelve passenger vans.  We had one walkiw talkie in each and well just image the fun we had with them...over and out.

      Buy your scorecards and crackerjacks...Ryan is lacing up the cleats again and has joined the  urlLink Northern Kentucky Amatuer Baseball League .  I don't know the name of my team yet, as it does not have a sponsor, but our first meeting is March 23rd.  My manager's name is General.  I think that is funny. The beautiful 60 degree weather makes me want to get my gear out and start playing.  Actually I still have not go the stuff out my car.  I think I will today, just to make sure it is all ready.  Also, I am going up to Chicago this weekend with all the CS Club.  Should be fun.  Seeing a couple museums.  I am making sure to take my camera and get some shots for the web page.

      As of today I have had my job for exactly one year.  Kind of scary.  It is not the best paying job, but I like it.  I get to help people and work with computers.  Not much goings-on here.  It is cold and that usually cuts down on most things.    The  urlLink Don't Tell Anna  page has been updated.  DTA is Ann's improv group.  We created and work on the page together.  Check it out.

      I had my first baseball practice in what seems like forever.  About 12-15 guys were there.  I played some outfield at the beginning of practice.  I am really out of shape, especially playing with guys who just came off of a high school season.  I did make a good diving catch that got a good rise out of all the dad's who were watching our practice instead of the little league parade going by.  I got to catch too.  I am amazed at how comfortable it was.  I thought for sure I would feel some muscle, but I caught four guys in a row about 20 pitches each and I was fine.  I am pretty sure that General (that is my coach) is going to start me there.  Mainly because I kept asking him if I could.  We don't have a team name or colors yet.  We did get numbers and we decided on gray pants.  Now I have to find a place to find pants.  Cool fact about our team is that we are made up entirely of guys who found the web page and enquired.  Anyway, we have practice on Wednesday and I can't wait!  First game is Sunday.  you can check out the schedule and other info  urlLink Here HTTP://NKABL.ORG

      Lots of news on the front here.  Let me start on Thursday...  Thursday I started the early shift at work so I got to see Ann play her softball game.  She did well going 1-3 in the first game with an RBI.  It  was  a softball game and ended up in a tie.  They played a second game and lost, but they had quite some fun.    Friday, after work I hung out with Ann after she had a phone interview with JVC (Jesuit Volunteer Corp) We went for Ice Cream at Maggie Moo's with Marrisa, Chris, and Jeff.  It was fun.  We also went up to this apartment Jeff had found and saw an awesome view of the city.  Saturday Ann won an award from the Computer Science Department for service and won $50.  She treated me to a meal at Beni Hana's.  That place is awesome.  It was also prom night so Ann and I had lots of fun people watching.  When we got back we met up with Chris and Marrisa again and Elizabeth was home with Hallie.  We went over to a bar in the Newport Levee.  It was an Irish bar and I forget the name,  the atmosphere seemed fake and artificial (well of course it was fake and artificial), but we had fun.  Sunday, I watched the football draft with Justin and Tom.  Bernard ddn't get drafted.  We went to BW3's and watched the PPV, also.  Today Ann found out she got accepted to JVC.  They placed her in Montana.  She will be at a women's shelter and living with a house of other volunteer's.  Justin also got offered a permanent job.  He hasn't accepted, but as much as he aggrivates me i think it would be od not to have him around.  That is about it from here...oh yeah, no baseball news whih is a bad thing...I emailed the president and hope this is just a communication problem...I am afraid it may not be.  Also, kristin I need your apartment address...i have something to send you!  All from here...

      Man oh man was it a beautiful day yesterday...  Things here are going well.  Not sure if I mentioned on here, but my baseball team disbanded before we ever got to our second meeting or practice.  Evidently General couldn't get enought akers for the team.  I have sent the President of the league an email asking to be placed...crossing my fingers and waiting.  The new office area at work is losing luster...all I could think about yesterday was how nice it was outside...I really hate this late shift, but only three more days of it.

      Well hold your hats and keep your hand on your wallet...the carnival is in town.  There is a carnival that stops in the Kroger parking lot a couple of times a year.  It is some of the lamest stuff you have ever seen.  Anyway, I have had a pretty wonderful time this weekend.  I went to the Reds game Friday night and Tom, Justin and I worked our way down to the blue section just in time to see the Reds cut a 8-1 lead to 8-7 before letting us down.  It was really cold too, so cheering helped warm us up.  Tom and Justin blame the loss on an Amazon looking dude who changed cheering positions towards the end of the inning.  Ann was on retreat all weekend.  actually she lead the Approach retreat this weekend.  this is the same retreat I went on two years ago.  She had been practicing her speach over and over again, and from what I have been told she did a wonderful job.  Megan halverson helped lead the retreat too.  That made me pull out my Grace and the Cgravel Road CD.  I really like the cd.  I don't know what I like more...the songs or knowing the people who sing them.  Okay that is about all I have for ya....I am workign the late shift so I might post  from work a couple of times this week.  Lata...

It doesn't hurt as nuch when I swallow and there is less stuff in my throuat now.  Though all the people at work are now getting it.  Well, that is all I have for now...

      Fun and exhausting weekend.  We left for Wisconsin after I got off work on Friday.  Took a while to pack up the car and made it there around midnight-ish.  The next morning we got up really early and moved Mary (Ann's sister) into her new apartment.  I also got to meet Ann's brother, sister-in-law and niece.  I also got to meet Ann's friend Andie just back from Nepal.  She had internesting stories and gave Annna game called Tigers and Goats. It is a very fun game.   Sunday we went to the Brewers game.  It was a slugfest as even the pitcher hit one out.  Padres won.  The new stadium is very nice. Monday, we drove back to Cincy.  That is a long drive.    Tom and I will sign our lease today.  Our apartment is in Hyde Park Plaza, across fromt he Hyde Park Kroger.

      The soreness has gone away.  I am thinking about throwing with someone today to really stretch my arm out.  Ann talked to Progressive yesterday and the guy who hit us has yet to report it...figures.    I found an apartment with Tom yesterday.  It is in Hyde Park and is about the same per month as my current place.  It has all new carpet and has just been repainted.  It is in a apartment complex across from Kroger and a lot of other stores.  I like it.  So it looks like next week will be moving week.    Ann's house had a picnic gathering thing last night that was fun.  Grilled out and played Cornhole.  It sounds weird, but it is a fun game.  Set up like horse shoes, but instead of a ring there is a wooden board with a hole in it.  Teams throw bean bags and get one point for landing on the board and three points for going in the hole.  Chris Hatch and I teamed up as the ultimate team gong undefeated throughout the night until we got banned from the game.  The funny thing is neither of us had played before.

      I was in a accident Monday.  We are all okay for the most part.  That is the important part.  We were on Beechmont Levee in Cincinnati near Lunkin Air Port.  We were going to Tumbleweed for Margarita Monday.  Ann was driving, I was in the passenger seat and Elizabeth and Hallie were in the back.  We were stopped admiring the american flag on the Ford 150 in front of us when there was a screetch followed by a crushing sound as we flew forward.  The we drilled the truck in front of us.  Ann's car was smashed on the front and back.  The truck hit the pontiac in front of him.  The guy in the 1990 Plymouth Van got out right away saying he was sorry.  Anyway after waitng for the police and then a ride back home we are very soar.  Now Ann is with out a car until the insurrance makes a decission.   We are all so sore.  My shoulders have been tight for two solid days.   I know Ann, Hallie and Elizabeth are all sore also.  I am not sure how I am going to end this post, but I thought I needed to say something.  I am gong to work on my web page sometime soon.

      Sunday I had my third NKABL game.  We played the Big Stix and it was a gorgeous day for baseball.  one that will make you say "let's play two!" and we were scheduled to.  The game was just up the street from my Grandma's house.  I got the nod as starting pitcher, mainly because I can get the ball over the plate.  My arm felt good and I cruised through the first two innings with 4 strike outs and no hits.  I got two more K's in the third inning before giving aup a questionable walk on a full count then a 2 run 415 foot shot to center field.  Gave up two more runs the rest of the game and got six more strike outs for a total of 12.  For the first time I was able to spot my fastball on the corner and was able to blow it by a few people.  My team scored one run.  No run support at all.  We lost 4-1 (for those of you who are not paying attention).  I went 0-1 with a strike out with 2 walks and a stolen base.  In the bottom of the sixth a man walked onto outr field and yelled, "I have a permit for 2 o'clock get off the field now or I am calling the cops!"  Ann took a picture of the ensuing yelling match between the coach of the Big Stix who takes care fo the field and the man.  He had a team of little leaguers who were to practice.  We never got to play our second game.  I was glad, while my arm was not hurting )which is a good sign) I knew I was not gong to be able to catch a second game.       Our team looked much better, but I guess when I am trhowing strikes we should look better.  At one point I refused to take the ball from our airhead shortstop because he didn't know how to throw around the horn.  Eventually Darryl explained that the third baseman always throws to the pitcher.  I had fun.  Ann brought Bethy and Elizabeth to the game.  I think they were impressed, but they also saw the argument which further  adds to their stigma of baseball and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Oh well...     RYN-O-METER   .333

      It was a very long but fun weekend.  Thursday, I finished up work and met Ann and her roomies downtown for the Senior Ball.  It was fun.  The dj was lame.  He was playing bad songs and then cutting them off half way through.  He also kept telling everyone he was from Kiss 107 like this dance was gong to make us start listening.  There was lots of drama...you know typical dance stuff.  Over the weekend Ann's family came to town and I spent a good chunk of time with them.  Judy is a big fan of the Ryan.rules.it ... so far that is two shout outs!  Ann graduated.  It was a long service.  We placed bets on when it would end.  Mary won with 2:25 or something close to that.  Justin also walked which was surprising.

      For Kristin:  Ryan, a 2-syllable boy's name of Celtic/Gaelic origin, means: The kings descendant; laughing.The ethnic backgrounds of Ryan include , Irish , English/Welsh  Okay, now with that out of the way I can advise that I am soooooooooooooo sore.  My shoulder and thighs hurt.  It is a good sore.  Something that feels like it is getting stronger, not deteriating.   Tom and I looked at  few apartments over the weekend.  Two of them are very nice.  One is in Oakley and the other in Hyde Park.  We should here back from them soon  so we can make a decision.  Okay, that is about all that I have here...

      This week went prety well.  Ann finished up school and is set to graduate this coming Saturday.  I went to a another Rufus concert this week.  Peter and Ann joined me.  It was in Louisville at Headliners.  It was a good show.  I had never been to Headliners, it is a noce place for a show.  Before the show I got to see Colin and Matt play a little ball.  They are on the big field now.  They have the unfortunate luck of being named the Devil Rays. I played my second game this week.  We got destroyed.  I went 1-2 with a double.  I broke up a no hitter then stole third.  I also pitched the last inning with 1 hit no runs no walks.  The team is 0-2, but I think I proved I should be pitching more.

      Let me give you the break down of my weekend:  Friday-  Got off work and headed over to Marissa's house for dinner at 7:00.  Marissa and Bethy made a great chicken dinner with rice and green beans.  Jeff Dake and Elise were there too.  It was very good and fun.  We then headed over to Bethy's house and met up with James Williams (his 22nd b-day), Allison, Audrey, and Elanore.  We then went to Serrento's.  It is a small bar/pizzaria that has Karaoke on Friday and Saturday.  It was fun and we sang a lot.  Barb (the dj) really liked James and Jeff.  The whole night was just wild.  Saturday-  First I woke up and went to ppick up the equiptment from General, because he is not going to be at the game on Sunday.  I am supposed to take 75 South and meet him at the Shell Station off the Cresent Spring exit.  Problem is there is not a Cresent Spring exit.  So no equiptment.  Then Tom and I watched a Soprano's marathon.  Then Jeff Kinne and Devon were in town and went to the Greek Fest with Justin, Sarah, and Tom.  Jeff and his crew didn't stay long, but Tom and Justin and Sarah had fun.  We then drove around in Justin's new car and got shakes.  Sunday-  The General won a game.  I was managing.  We won in extra innings.  We lost the second game, but a split is more than I ever could have hoped.

      A very funny call came in today.  An office in Columbia, SC was closed today.  If you call the office phone number you get a message advising of the new 800 number to call.  Her comes the kicker...the number that they give you to call is the wrong one.  It is one number off.  That one number points the caller to a 800 Sex Line.

      Have you ever wondered how it would feel to be a glacier?  to move so slow that nothig can really tell you are moving.  Well I don't have to wonder anymore as that is iexactly how work felt yesterday.  It was the company picnic and not technically being part of the picnic, I had to sty and watch the phones.  No one called at all.  It was amazing.  I thought for sure that I would be swamped.    After work I cam ehome and watched TV with Tom until going to see Wit's End perform in Newport with Elizabeth End and Greg LeSaint.  Wit's End is an improv comedy group.  It was a good show, but not great.  Elizabeht did manage to confuse the guy at the door enough to let us pay $3 instead of the posted $5.  If you just hand them money and walk in they don't really count it.  The group seemed very disorganized.  They also didn't follow the rules of the game they were playing too well.  Yeah it is impro, but just from listening to Ann I have higher regards for people who follow the rules of improv.  I can tell that Eliabeth really wants to perform more and is hoping someone puts together a group.     When I got home at 11:30 (that is right the show was two and a half hours long), Justin was there....which is weird because his car is dead.  In fact he got a new car.  A 2002 Nissan Sentra.  I didn't want to tell him how my dad had a Sentra that I had wrecked and then had died on my dad a few years later.  That is all from here...

      Beginning of the week has been pretty normal.  Sunday I called and talked to Ann up in Cedarburg.  She is going camping (in a cabin)up north the rest of the week with Susie.  It sounds very relaxing.  Our refridgerator is being fixed today, so we will finally be able to keep things cold.   I think I am going to an improv show with Elizabeth End this tonight.  On that same note I have been working on the DTA Website  urlLink http://laugh.at/donttellanna   I found a good instructional baseball site today with a link to a book my dad bought and loves.  He says that when people say play baseball by the book...they mean this book.  urlLink FrozenRope.com  is the name of the site.

      Yesterday I went to King's Island with Kristin Wiley, Elizabeth End, Kristin Hill and Greg Taylor.  It was good and very hot.  We got to the Park at 10:00 and hit every ride by the time we were finished.  I have quite the sunburn.  Today the General took it on the chin again.  We lost 8 or 9 to 3.  I went 2-2 with three RBI's from my first homerun of the season.  It was a small field, but I hit it pretty hard.  Have a double header next week.

      Another busy day for Ryan.  After work I went and saw Spiderman with Marissa.  We went to Chipotle first for dinner.  Marissa flirted with the manager after he mentioned he had been to the place in Colorado her shirt was from.  Then bought/comp'd her meal.  Then as she was getting her drink he was checking her out.  She took it in stride.  Then she thanked him for the meal as we left.    We got the movie just in time...not that it mattered with two commercials (yes commercials not previews).  There were a whole 5 or six other people in the theater.  It was a good movie.  Action Packed.  I wish I knew the comic book story a little better, but then I would only use that to critique it more.  All in all worht the money and time.  After the movie Marissa and I went to Cleneay to see Jeff.  He had invited us to the baseball game tonight.  As we were leaving we saw Billy riding his bike.  He seemed very calm and told us that the street was dead now and pretty boring.  Then he advised that he was going up to Dana's and that he was going to be "off his bat"...yeah we didn't klnow what that meant either.  I asked him what being "on" his bat was like and he replied "being cool" then making a gesture with his hand like he was the Fonz.  He then advised that Ann had actually named his bike the batmobile (Ann says this never happened which makes it even funnier).  Later, Billy said "So, Hallie is coming into town....Amazing!"  Someone needs to make a documentary on Billy.  It would be a classic independent film.  I am working out the details of a flight to Florida to spend the first week of July with my family on vacation.I have learned that Saturday flights are less expensive than Sunday night flights.  Ann is joining us and I think it may be possible to meet up with her flight when it stops in Cincinnati on the way to West Palm Beach.

      Tuesday night I went to the Reds Mariners game with Tom, Justin, Nic, Kevin, and Dolph.  It was a horrible game for the  urlLink Reds .  They lost 8-1.  In the sixth Dunn struck out with the basese loaded then Kearns hit into a double play.  I can say I have seen Ichiro play now.  After the game we went to Justin's and I stopped by and saw Marissa.  She started her job at  urlLink Federated Department stores  on Monday.  I think we are goin to go see Spiderman this week.  Krisitn and Hallie are coming in this weekend and we will be going to King's Island.  I amd still waiting to hear from Kristin Hill to see if she is coming.  Things at work have been really busy.  The data center for the company moved to Kanas City last weekend and there has been nothing but trouble since.  Every other hour a server either crashes or loses connectivity.  The worst part is the poeple in charge of the stuff breaking get upset because we are telling them it is down.  They call us and say that it is not even thought 50 people will call and say it cannot be accessed.  We have are manager call them and suddenly there IS a problem with the server.  Politics.

      We lost our game.  I gave up a lot of 0-2 hits on stupid pitches.  My catcher loves to go inside on hitters and the one thing I know is that I am not goin to blow anyone away inside.  I just don't throw hard enough.  So I got burned a couple times.  I also gave up a lot of bloop hits.  I didi go 2-2 with a walk and a run.  That puts my average at .500 (not too shabby).  I went home Sunday and saw my brother's play a game.  My dad is not coaching them this year because of a schedule problem that ended up not being a problem at all.  He gets to see all the games and it is killing him that he is not coaching.  Dr. Sculte is their coach and oh the memories it brings back.  He was my coach when I was 12 in Little League.  I think he is still telling the same stories that he was telling then.  It is funny to see Colin and Matt react to him.

      Got off work and Peter had called wanting to know if I wanted to attend the Red's game.  I picked him up at 5:35 to get to the game early for bobble heads.  Chris Sabo bobbleheads to be exact.  Well we got there too late as they were all gone, only going to the first 10,000.  As we were walking up there were people leaving with three or four in hand.  I hate those people.  Anyway we got in and sat with Sam Stephens and a fw other people.  The game went three innings when the rain cloud of death showed up and rained for anhour straight.  We left and the game continued a hour and a half later.  The Reds won in the 11th with Boone's second HR of the night.

      Got emails from K$ and Jeff Kinne today.  I am hoping to get a King's Island trip with K$ and Kristin Hill and anyone else wo may want to go.  Ms. Wiley starts her summer job this week and seems excited.  I can't wait until she comes back to town and gets movie night started.   Jeff emailed and IMed me today.  he seems a little bored in Minnesota.  Cannot blame him.    Speaking of movies, I watched Rushmore with Tom tonight.  It is a decent movie.  Still weirds me out a little.  It reminds me of Ann because she listened to the soundtrack most of the last year.  At first I thought it was odd that all these songs Ann liked were on the movie, but then I remembered that after we watched it together she burned the soundtrack cd.  Reds won.  yep...bout out of things to talk about...going to bed now

      Well after getting off of work on Friday the weekend was relaxing.  I did a lot of nothing, but that is good because I hve been very busy lately.  Saturday I went to the grocery and then talked to both of my parents.  Saturday night I jsut hung out and watched tv with Tom.  Sunday I played my game.  It went a little better.  We lost 9-7.  I went 2-3 with a rbi double and a single.  It was close, but our defense killed us, again.  I caught the whole game and threw a guy out stealing.  Tom came and had the sentiments.  we play at the nice field next Saturday.  It has a grass infield (I can't believe that there are so many baseball fields with out grass infields...I would kill to play another game on a PRP like field).

It is like they cannot sit still with out talking.  They are now arguing over wheter or not users should be allowed to download programs onto their machines and how if a user does they are not going to know what they are doing. Ahhhh....they are driving me crazy.

      I got to talk to Ann last night.  Her sister Judy had a baby girl, Anna Kathleen (Ann told me if it started with a K or a C, but I can't remember now).  Ann is leaving for SAn Diego tomorrow to see her Uncle, then will head off to Rancho La Puerta.  I thought this was going to be a spa, but after she read the web page she seems to make it out to be a get in shape camp.  Evidently they are not allowed to eat anything but vegetables the first few days and will be getting up at 6 a.m. for morning walks.    Justin came over last night and we watched the MTV Movie Awards.  After work today Tom and I went to Wal-mart to purchase a television and we also found a bunch of connections in the neighborhood.  I think I can get around the Hyde Park area a lot better now.

      All moved in.  Still do not have internet.  So I am posting from work. Moved Ann out for good this weekend.  We had a fun week.  Wednesday I helped Kristin and Marissa move stuff.  They have a nice apartment and live in the same complex woth Justin.  We also had Dewey's pizza.  I  packed all my stuff up that night and then they helped me move on Thursday.  Along with Elise, Bethy and Matt.  Bethy made us dinner which was good.  Friday, I cleaned out the Ivanhoe apartment with Justin.  Then Ann and I  went to Amol (our favorite Indian restaurant).  Saturday I had my baseball game.  The game was horrible.  I pitched.  I wih I had a defense.  Really I do.  There were about 6 or 7 pop ups to the out field that should have been caught.  When I say should have been caught I am not counting balls in the gap...I mean regular fly balls with the outfielder planted under them.  My arm felt great until a 60 pitch third inning.  I through six innings.  In the sixth General tried to pull me after the left fielder horribly misplayed a flyball.  Here is the conversation:  General: "Steve how is your arm feeling?" Ryan: "NO!" Steve: "Good." Ryan: "NO!" General: "Ryan are you sure?" Ryan: "You are not gong to pull me from the game because the left fielder cannot catch a fly ball!"  So I stayed in the rest of the inning.  I hate losing, but I hate losing even more when people don't know how to play baseball.  It is like I am in Little League again!  Ann came to the game and from the way she talked I think she is starting to enjoy them.  She didn't bring a book this time. After the game we went to my apartment so I could change and Tom was working on putting together a desk he bought.  We then went to a Thai restaurant called the Bankok Bistro.  It was good and very spicey.  Ann got sushi and I got a shrimp pasta.   Sunday i drove Ann and the last of her stuff near Purdue in Indiana and met up with her sister Mary.  It sucks that we will be so far away from each otherr for a long time.  I am confident though that I will be able to find ways to go see her.   When I got back to Cincy, after three hours of the loneliest stretch of Indiana highway, I hung out with Tom and Justin at the apartment.  We watched the basketball game...  That was my week... by wednesday I will be bale to update the rest of the page.

      We won our baseball game today.  We are 3-1 since General has disappeared on us.   The last two weeks we have won with only 8 people on the field.  Today we won 22-7 over te C. White Tiles.  I got the win going the first 4 innings.  Mike Brooks, the manager of the CW Tiles and the head of the league, acknowledged General's leaving the team and has put me in charge for the time being.  he said General never paid himt he deposit or league fees for the team.  He said he would call me and help me work it out so the team can continue.  I hope we can. If we go into the tournament on a hot streak and 9 players (cross our fingers) then we may be Louisville bound.  There are eight teams in the league and the final two in the tournament go to the show.  We know we can beat three of them.  More importantly they know we can beat them.

      Yes, I know.  Ryan hasn't updated in a while.  So in the words of Indigo Montoya in  The Princess Bride , "Let me sum up."  Monday I went to work and then Marissa gave me a ride to the airport. There I met up with the lovely Ann and we flew to West Palm Beach airport.  It was a nice flight and we made it to the airport a little early.  The next five days was filled with beaches, pools, sun and fun.  I think Ann had a good time.  My Aunt Betty has a very beautiful condo and the weather was warm with a little rain.  My dad, brothers, and Ann all went golfing twice.  It was fun.  I have not been golfing in a while and Ann had never been at all.  She made Matt's day by letting him drive the cart one hole.  Got back from Florida and went to work for a few days and was asked to work desktop support for a week or two.  I am still working desktop support as opposed to the help desk.  It is good because I get to go to people's desks and build computers.  Then Ann came in on Wednesday.  She was kaming her way around the country before she heads out to Montana at the end of the month.  We went out for Indian food twice, went to the E (a bar in Hyde Park), bowling, and hung out with a ton of people including the likes of K$, Marissa, Bethy, Susan, Rob, some guy named Jeff, and Chris Hatch.  Sunday, Ann was happy because she got to attend the second Team General victory.  We defeated Elmaer Dessens' brother Omar 13-6.  I went 3-5 and had 4 RBIs.  General no showed again and there is a rumor he has been transfered and moved to Birmingham, Alabama.  We played the game 8 on 8.  At first, it was embarasing when 5 minutes before game time we had four players.  Then when the other team only had 8 I didn't feel as bad.  Anyway that is my last two weeks. Ann left today for Washington, D.C. and is going to be there until her new niece's baptism next weekend.  Until I have more to write...

      Well it is settled...we lose.  Evidently the Prophets wanted nothing of us and chose the rain delay/cancel instead of giving us our last at bats.  I think it is the wrong call.  I know the by-laws state that, but this is a tournament game!  Winner goes to the regional tournament.  We had them on the ropes!  Arggh!  So that is the official end of Team General.  You can close the book and send it off to the Baseball HOF.

      The General had a pretty good day today.  We won our first game of the NKABL tournament, 7-1.  I pitched a complete game and had seven strike outs.  We beat the second highest ranked team in the league.   We started the second tournament started at three and we played well.  The game was stopped in the top of the last inning with the score 4-3 with the Prophets in the lead.  I was up with one out and men on first and second.  It rained for two hours.  I am not sure how they will settle this. The championship game is next week.  I got to talk to Ann on Friday.  She is on her way from Portland to Missoula this weekend.  She said she is more excited than scared now and that is great.

      So here is the news... Yesterday at work it was announced that the RAM Help Desk is being closed and all calls wil be sent to a Michigan outsource company.  This means my job will end as of October 11th.  Not good news.  Yesterday was nuts.  It all started after lunch when the big boss showed up unannounced.  Our immediate manager went into a meeting with him then all the permanent employees went in one at a time.  Not good when tey all came out with green folders.  The folders had the severence packages in them.  Right away they all went home.  Kind of weird that at a job where they wouldn't let the contractors work alone they just all of the sudden leave all the contractors alone.   Anyway, it sucks because I really liked this job.  I learned new stuff everyday and got to help people.  So now I am on the job hunt again.  Atleast I am getting paid while hunting this time.  TekSystems is coming in Friday to help us.  Kelly, the recruiter, advised there are plenty of open jobs she can place us in.  That is a bright spot.  That is all I know for now...if you have an opening and want to hire me...well, do it!

      Wow!  I have not updated in quite some time.  Not too much has gone on.  We lost our baseball game last weekend.  The good news is the standings came out and we are no longer in last place.    In other news Kristin Hill is getting married this weekend.  Saturday in fact.  i will be heading back to Louisville for that one.  It should be interesting to see some old faces at the wedding.  Speaking of old faces I spoke to Whitney Blaine on IM this week.  She seems to be doing well.  She is in school and working as a nanny.  Ann left for Portland this morning.  K$ and Elizabeth went to her house last night and our occompaning her out west.  It should be a fun trip.  I already miss her.  It is weird...I missed having her in town and now I miss just IMing with her.  It will be a long year, but my letter writing should improve.  Tom is gone for the weekend and Justin too.  it is amazing how all my friends leave at the same time.  Justin is going to Wapak or Iowa, I am not sure.  Tom is house sitting for his dad.  Mr. Greaves is biking up to Sturgis.  Other than all that there is not too much goin on.

      Started at Square D this week.  It went well.  It is odd stepping into new situations.  So many inside jokes that I just don't get.  I am going to be training for the next 6 weeks.  That is about four and a half more weeks than I got at Liberty Mutual.  Square D is a very organized place.  I crashed on Friday night after working for three days.  I slept most of the evening.  Saturday I went to Oktoberfest with Marissa, Kristin, and Elizabeth End.  It was packed being that the  UC/OSU game had just ended as well as a Reds double header.  Good times.  Marissa met up with this guy she is dating from work.  He had been drinking all day so I will hold off judgement.  The Reds final game at Riverfront/Cinergy was today.  It was on tv.  The game was horrible, but I the after game festivities were great.  No stopping Tom Browning.  Cats won again.  4-0.

      What hasn't happpened sincelast I typed?  I accepted the full-time position at Square D and start on Monday.  My last day at Liberty is tomorrow.  The football season is is in full swing, along witht he fantasy football season.  I am in four leagues this year.  My usual league with Justin, Tom and Jim.  I am also in the Risley league as well/  My cousin Michael is running it and as of right now I am winning my week one match up.    Watching football is in full swing as well.  University of Kentucky defeated ranked Louisville and then UTEP 77-17 to jump out to 2-0.  I talked to a gentleman at work today who said he had gone to the game and said it was the biggest blow out he had ever seen in Commonwealth Stadium.  By the way...why is Kristin Titan fan...I mean common I will give her the Cardinals, but the Titans?  I wonder if she even knows who Warren Moon or Ernest Givens is?  Fun n' Gun?  I have been lucky to talk to Ann in Missoula quite a bit.  She is enjoying her job very much.  She really likes the people she works with and that is great.  I have been hanging with K$ and Marissa a lot.  This Saturday I went with them to K$'s home town of Scippio, Indiana.  It was a small community.  Lots of farms.  We got to go to the oh so famous Broomsage.  It was a "country club" if I ever saw one.  Mullets, trashy outfits, line dancing, rap music, and the live stylings of "Eastern Sky".  It also has a lake outside with a twisty slide.  Let's see what else has happened...we went out to the gambling boats for Tom's 22nd birthday.  I didn't win money, but I think everyone ese did.    That is about it...I will be trying to update more often.

      Okay it is 26 days later and the computer is not back up.  It is frustrating, but I have had plenty of other stuff to do.  Work has really kicked up as I am now on the phones full time.  I still do not really know all the answers at work and it gets frustrating sometimes because it is not my computer knowledge that is lacking, but the specific program knowledge.  I know that will come though.  Maurice, a co-worker at Liberty, started today.  I got all my insurance info in the mail this week including the all important card for the wallet.  Overall, this has been a very good month.  With the long distance minutes on my cell phone and calling cards I have been able to talk to her quite a bit.  We are also writing letters back and forth...kind of like pen pals.  Kristin, Bethy and Marissa have been keeping me busy.  We have had game night about every week and last Thuursday I hosted a  Survivor  get together.    Justin has also been hanging out quite a bit.  This is a good thing.  He and Sarah seem to be doing well.   That is also good.  That is all I can think of for now...

      Nothing like starting a week with a nice SQL slammer virus.  Well, that is how I started the week.  My machine was not infected, but a good portion of the machines on my works network were and they all called on Monday.  Ahhhhh!  The rest of the week hasn't been so bad.  It starting to get a little warmer around here and the NKABL is starting to pick up.  I have a solid seven players lined up and two more on the ropes.  There is a manager meeting on Sunday that will give us a little better idea on where we stand.    Song of the week:  "Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley" by the Kingston Trio

      Good to see the Cats take down a number one ranked team.  It looks like the General are officially the Northern Kentucky Mavericks.  Things are startig to come together.  If you have a good design for the team send it my way and if picked you may get a free hat or jersey.  Not much else gong on here.    Song of the week: "Hong Kong Phooey" by Sublime

      Nothing like a good weekend of baseball.  Friday, I went to the Reds game with Tom.  We bought $30 tickets nine rows from the field from a scalper for half price.  The rain never came and the game was fun to watch.  The Reds lost, but I was able to see Sean Burroughs play up close.  That is right, Little League World Champion Sean Burroughs.  I watched the NFL draft the next morning and headed off to the first  urlLink Northern Kentucky Mavericks  scrimmage.  We looked good for a first get together.  I pitched the first two innings and gave up only one run.  I hadn't pitched in a while and sure do feel it today.  Saturday night I headed to the gambling boats with Justin and Tom.  My luck on the boats wasn't that great, but it was fun.  Sunday afternoon we headed to Great American Ballpark agai.  We sat in the bleachers rolled up our sleaves, took in some sun, and watched the Reds win.  I hit the fields again in the evening and took BP with Robby and Adam.  Man was I sore.  That was my weekend.  I am going to update  urlLink my page  tomorrow.  Stay tuned...

      I spent Friday night in Indianapolis and finally saw  urlLink "The Freindly"  that I have heard all the Hoosier girls talk about.  "The Friendly" is the place to hang out in  urlLink Zionsville  home of Jim Russell and the Russell family.  I headed up to Indy with K$ and lil' Beth.  The next morning we went to the  urlLink Indianapolis Race for the Cure .  Carol's mom is a breast cancer survivor and has a team run every year.  The race was early and a 5K.  I was able to  urlLink run a mile  and then walked the rest.     I am in no way close to being in shape, but it was fun and I finished 4075th.  Not bad out of 35,000 people.

      Hey all,  I just got back from my week long visit to Montana.  It was great.  For those who do not kow, Ann has been living in Montana since August.  She is working with JVC.  The trip started with a twist as I transferred planes in Utah to go to  urlLink Missoula  and found out that I was on a plane headed to Kalispell, Montana.  It was okay though because one half hour later and a new flight crew we were off to Missoula.    It was great spending time with Ann.  She was able to get itme off and we had a great time.  We climbed  urlLink the M  , walked along the  urlLink river , and went to  urlLink Hot Springs  to soak in the mineral water.  The best was just hanging out with Ann.  I learned how to play a couple different versions of dominos and how to make baked ziti.  It was fun.  It was fun to get a break from normal day to day stuff.    While I was away the Cats lost in the big dance and the Reds lost their opener.  I was able to watch the game on TV, but had to turn it off in the 8th because they looked bad.  I will get my pictures from te trip developed and on the web soon.

      A lot has happened over the last couple of weeks and I am sorry I have not posted.  I have been very busy.  I was on-call this week and am working the Memorial Day Monday as I write this.  The Mavs are a dismal 0-1 four weeks into the season.  Three rainouts and a bye week have been very depressing.  On a good note, I watched the Big 12 baseball final (Texas v. Baylor) on TV Sunday and I am stoked to start playing.  College baseball on TV just gets the baseball vibes going.  I think it is the "ping!" and the not so professional look of the games.  My brothers graduated from St. Albert this week.  Matt and Colin both won awards during the ceremony.  Congrats to them.  With the winning of another Viking award, it is possible the Dempsey's may lead the country in Viking awards.  Someone look that up.  Yesterday was Miss Kelly's 17th birthday.  Happy birthday Kelly!  We received our keys to the new apartment and the rooms have been divvied up and my room has Wayne's coating.  White Wayne's Coating to be exact.  It looks like a room straight out of The Sims.  We will be moving our stuff over the next week.  Ann will be in town in less than a month.  She will be visiting for the big  urlLink Kinne-Skyllingstad wedding .  It should be fun.

      Justin packed it up and headed for Chicago today.  Who knows when we will see him again?  Okay, so he will be back on Saturday for the wedding, but after that who knows.  The great news is Ann will be in town in three days!  I can't wait.  I have missed her so much.

      Since my last post it seems everyone has decided to move away.  For starters Lyle and Nic decided to take off for Arizona.  Why?  I am not really sure.  Then I read that Kristin and Greg are moving to Murray.  Now Justin has taken a job in Chicago.  He leaves next Sunday.  I guess it was fun living with him for 22 days.    This means Tom and I are now looking for a new roommate.  Good news is Ann will be in town in two weeks for Jeff and Devon's wedding.  I am excited to see her.  It seems like it has been ages.  This weekend she is on a river trip.    The basball team is doing well, but the league is taking a beating with it raining the past four Sundays.  The Mavs are 1-2 and we will probably have double-headers the rest of the summer.

      It was good to here from Jeff Kinne via email.  They have settled in Madison and are slowly becoming Brewers fans.  Last night I hung out with K$.  In fact I destroyed her in Scrabble.  It was good to see her and the "always winking" Marissa.

      The Mavericks took it on the chin, again.  The game started off well.  I walked and scored from first when mat doubled, but the game went downhill when Eric got rocked for like 12 runs in the third.  It was really hot.  I caught, but made Darryl catch the fourth.  When I came back in the fifth the umpire thanked me.  I am glad to see I am not the only one bothered by his lack of talent behind the plate.  The funniest moment actually happened prior to the game starting.  A car pulled up and the guy inside asked if this was a semi-pro league.  I said no and he asked if he could play.  We only had eight at the time and I said sure.  He proceeded to step out of his car with no shirt and bright purple baseball pants with yellow pin stripes.  I don't know if I was more distracted by the pants or the bling around his neck.  He wrote down his number and said to call him if we didn't have nine by game time.  His name?  Kojack!  I got to watch Chris Burke play in the Futures All-Star game tonight.  Not bad when Peter Gammons is using your scouting report on a pitcher in the first inning.

      Here is something that has been bothering me the last couple of days.  In baseball when traded from the NL to the AL all your stats start from zero.  If a player had 15 homeruns in the AL and then is traded to the NL he has 0 homeruns in the NL homerun standings.  What if 1 of the 15 homeruns before being traded came against a NL team in an interleague game.  Shouldn't he then have 1 homerun when he starts obtainig NL stats?  Wouldn't he then only have 14 AL homeruns?  Would he have always only had 14 AL homeruns if he hadn't been traded?  Not even Tom could give me a good answer on that one?  Does any one have an answer?

      CUTTING GRASS ON THE 4th OF JULY  A lot of has gone on over the last two weeks and I just have not blogged about it.  Luckily for you I am going to blog about it now. Ready?  Here we go.  Ann was supposed to come into town on Wednesday night (June 25th), but due to tornadic weather in Minnesota she had to spend the night in the Twin Cities.  She was able to make it in on Thursday morning and we had a blast the rest of the weekend.  Thursday we met up with K$ and went shopping.  I had to get a new dress shirt for Devon and Jeff's wedding.  That evening we met up with Marissa and went to a Korean restaurant in Northern Kentucky.  We sat at a two-foot table.  Friday Ann had an interview downtown while I was at work.  When I got back we attended the Kinne wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner.  The dinner was at a winery north of Cincinnati.  The best man of the wedding was Mike Matera.  It was good to see Mike.  He has been in Italy the last year and is coming back to attend grad school in Milwaukee.  The dinner was awesome.  We did some wine tasting and we grilled our own dinner on this really big grill.  I say we, but Jeff's grandfather took to Ann and I and did the grilling for us.  Jeff and his brothers got a kick out of that.    Saturday was the wedding.  Got to see a lot of out-of-towners including Gustavo, Beth Keene and Justin.  The reception was great.  There was a lot of dancing and an open bar.  Or was it the other way around.  After the party we went to the Greek Festival.  There were a lot of friends there and Ann got to see a lot of people she was hoping to see.  Sunday the mavericks had a double header.  After kicking another team off the field and coming up a player short we lost two games.  Had the field not been 275 all around I am sure it would have been a different game.  Ann was a trooper staying for both games.  We were both fried from all the sun.  After the game we ate at Amol India and saw are favorite waiter.  he was worried because we had not come in for a long time.  Ann said she had been in Montana and I had no excuse.  The Saag was good, but I got it a little too spicy.    Monday Ann headed back to Montana.  It was great to see her and I can't wait to fly out and drive across the country with her.  The rest of the week was busy at work.  It was busy for a regular week, but even busier because Canada was off for a day and it was short week in the US.  These are usually things that make a week less busy.  I have not done a lot this weekend.  My family is floating in the Caribbean and Tom has spent most of his time hanging with his family.  I did cut the grass today including the grass down in the valley behind the house.  Not too much has gone on.  I have tried to stay out of the sun for the most part.    I am going to try to update my blog more often.  Today while looking at the route we are going to take from Montana I looked for free Wi-Fi hotspots, but there were not too many.  I am sure we will run across a few.

      Ahhh, good old blogger.  Thought I had forgotten about blogging, heh?  Well you were wrong.  A lot has happened since July 17th, so in the words of Indigo Montoya "Let me sum up".  Ann is back.  It is great.  In August, I flew out to Missoula and we drove back to Cincinnati.  We went down through Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons.  We stopped in Lander, Wyoming and had a visit with Elizabeth.  We then headed to Colorado stopping in Boulder and Denver.  We stayed in Denver for a couple days and I drove on the highest road in North America on the way up Mt. Evans.  I will be scanning pictures this week to post.  After Denver we headed back to Ohio.  The drive through the flat Midwest is, well as flat.  Since being back Ann has got a new job and a roommate, the honorable Elizabeth End.    Other things around own have changed as well.  K$ took got a full time teaching job in Madison, Indiana and the Reds sold their entire team away to AL contenders.  I am not sure which one bothers me more.  The Bengals have shown promise.  Just enough to make me get excited for Sunday, but not enough to win.  Colin and Matt started high school at St. X and are running cross country.    Kelly scored a 1430 on her SATs.  The Mavericks never won another game and self distrusted while I was out west.  No one from the team can really tell me what happened, but I am not so sure I really want to know.  Kristin and Greg moved to China, er I mean Murray.  Jim and Kristen got engaged at a DMB concert.      Let's see what else can I catch all my loyal readers up on...hello loyal reader(s)?  Where are you?

      First, let me wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving.  I a then going to follow that with a big "Who Dey!"  Yep the Bengals just won again and are on what I would consider an unstoppable roll.    I had a good Thanksgiving.  I love stuffing.  This year there was only one meal because Matt had a cross country meet in North Carolina On Saturday.  Still waiting to hear how he placed.  It was good to see family.  Got some good exercise chasing Patrick and Trevor around the neighborhood.    Friday I picked up Ann and Elizabeth fromt eh airport and we headed to the wedding of Danny and Nicole.  It was fun.  The wedding was at Xavier and the reception at a country club north of Cincinnati.  The food was great and the dancing even better.  I had a great time with Ann and then Saturday started book three in the Harry Potter series.  Yeah, I know that they have been out for a bit, but give me a break.

      Hi everybody!  I guess this would be considered an October/November update.  Soon after the last blog note I turned 24.  Ann and I had an action packed weekend.  We saw St. X play Trinity, Colin and Matt run a cross country meet,  and Kentucky play Football.  The next week we went to Milwaukee for Ann's birthday.  We soon got on quite the bowling kick.  We bowled with a group from my work and then again in Wisconsin.  We have since been going to Stone's Lanes on Tuesdays.  They have a deal that includes 3 games and shoe rental for $7.  Not bad.  I  am averaging around 140.    I went to my first Bengals game last week.  I saw the mighty orange and black knock off the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs.  I went with Paul from work and we were in the very top row at the 50 yard line.  Not horrible seats at all considering.  I had a blast.  I wish the seats were a little wider and can't see how people bigger than me can sit at all.    As for my web site I am not sure what I am going to do.  I am thinking of leaving my blog up as the main page and just using tripod as a secondary link.  I don't know.  We will just have to wait and see.

'Reckon I'll start on number  when Ann finishes up this week.  59 minutes left of my last on call weekend of 2003.  Nothing like starting the end of the year count downs.  I assume VH1 and MTV will get started with those soon.  Not much news, but trying to get into a habbit of posting agian...

      "Why'd you turn against me, Gordon? For six years, I taughtcha how to skate, I taughtcha how to score, I taughtcha how to go for the 'W'. You could have been one of the greats! An' now look at yourself. You're not even a has-been. You're a never-was. " - Coach Reilly,  The Mighty Ducks  (1992)  Wednesday night I played my first floor hockey game in the Cincinnati Sports League.  It was more than I was anticipating.    It is a co-ed league with 5 players on the ice... er... gym floor at a time.  Seems simple enough, right?  Well let me tell you it is not.  Ann and I arrived before the game and quickly found our fellow teammates and prepared for the game.   Then we saw the other team.  Their team name was "Off the Ice" and were they ever.  We are pretty sure the goalie was Canadian.  He was sporting actual goalie equipment including the painted mask.  Every other team member was wearing some sort of armor that looked to be designed for Barry Bonds or a samurai.  We were wearing shorts and t-shirts.    They scored first, but then I earned my first assist when I hit Scott over the middle for the score.  It went downhill from there.  I took a nose dive trying to run and swing at the same time and got my first knee strawberry in like 6 years.  Later in the game the ref yelled 1 minute left just as a member of the other team took off on a break away.  The score tied 2-2 I sprinted after him and made up ground quickly.  I scooped the puck from in front of him and off the gym wall back towards the center of the ice and in the same motion hit the ground hard.  I slid into the boards.  It was really a few boxes and a table turned on it's side, but it is cooler to say boards.  My team cheered and I popped right up and was feeling great until I hear the whistle blow...HALF TIME!  What?  Half time?  We have to play for another 20 minutes?    Needless to say I didn't have anything left in the tank.  I don't think the rest of my team did either because over the next twenty minutes we gave up 6 unanswered goals.  Beyond the score it was fun.  We have a bye week next week, but after that I am sure we will pull it together a string of victories.    Okay, that is all I have.  So remember to keep your stick on the ice and put the puck in the goal...or something like that.

      Sunday morning I was playing Madden and listening to  urlLink Satchmo  when I heard Tom run down the stairs yelling.  "I hate being lied to!   urlLink Rich Apuzzo  I hate you."  Seems that Tom was expecting snow when he woke up.  Not more than 15 minutes later there was a layer of white covering the ground.  It didn't stop for several hours.  In the south that means mass chaos.  Speaking of chaos...can that Ashton Kutcher film look any worse?    So Monday morning the roads were a mess.  Nothing like leaving for work 20 minutes earlier and arriving 15 minutes late.  Other than snow there is not too much news around here.  I have kept up the work out thing.  Ann and I go to the YMCA every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  I am up to 3 miles on the elliptical machine.  Like I said, not much going on.   I do suggest reading the Sports guy  urlLink SuperBlog  this week on ESPN Page 2.

      If possible I suggest watching the one and only season of  urlLink Undeclared .  It was a great show that got cut down by short sided Fox Television execs that thought shows with midgets racing elephants was more entertaining.  Tom was able to find all the episodes online.   I am now trying to get a hold of Freaks and Geeks episodes.

      Have you ever had a theme song stuck in your head?  Right now I have the 9 second Scrubs theme song stuck in mine.  "I can't do it all by myself...I'm no Superman".  It doesn't help that I began work today at 4:00 AM and I have no one to talk to!  I am working early because the third shift guy had to leave early.  Actually, other than the loneliness and that theme song it is not that bad.  No calls come in until after 6:30 AM and I look like the good guy for coming in.    I finished my big "clean out the closet" project this week.  I sent four trash bags of old clothes to work with Ann.  She said it was weird seeing people wearing my clothes.  It is also a lot easier to find things in my closet now.

      Happy New Year!  It is one of my resolutions to blog once a week.  In fact, that is one of several resolutions I have.  I am also going to try to add pictures to the site every week.  Ann and I have joined the YMCA and I want to go at least three times a week.   Like I said, that is the plan.    Have you looked at the rest of the site yet?  Check out the link to the right...wait....check it out after reading.  Once you do you will see the new pictures from my digital camera.  Pretty awesome, heh?  Now that resolution isn't looking so hard.    The fourth resolution is to convince Ann I do not look good in a chinstrap beard.  I know I don't and you know I don't, but to get her to believe it I am growing one for the next week.  Maybe that will be next week's picture?

      Ann and I went down to Lousiville to hang with my sibs this weekend.  My parents took a trip to San Diego.  Friday, I went to the St. Albert Fish Fry with Ann, Colin and Matt.  After, we went to Executive Bowl.    Saturday, we went to bardstown road and went window shopping.  We learned all about fung shui cycles.  Be careful for "Blood accidents" this cycle!!!  Sunday, I drove the boys to track practice and Ann taught Matt how to play the guitar.  It is all about power chords. All in all it was a fun weekend.

      Last night Ann and I scored a total of 5 goals in a losing effort.  Ann scored in both halves and I had a hat trick in the second half.  We didn't win the game, but the team came together in the last 8 minutes and it looks like we may be gelling.  Still have open fantasy baseball spots...email me!

      Actually, hockey may be my game, but floor hockey is certainly not.  I was only one of of two guys on my team to show up.  This meant I played the entire game.  Some loyal readers may remember that in the first game I was done after the first half.  Well, I played the whole game last night, but didn't play well.  I did log my second assist, but we lost by such a high score that I am not sure they will publish it on the  urlLink CSL  page.

      The three greatest words in on-line buying.  My latest on-line purchase was a battery for my laptop.  After weeks of price checking, I watched it arrive at my door through the handy dandy UPS web page.  Now my house is as wireless as it gets.  In fact, I am writing this on my couch as I watch Leo and the gang on The Screen Savers.   My second hockey game is tonight.  Hopefully the team can pull it together and get back to .500!!!

      I have been known to consume a caffeinated beverage now and again, but  urlLink Cincinnati Vending  has helped me on the first step of kicking the addiction.  No, it was not helping me recognize that I am addicted to caffeine, but raising the prices of a bottle to $1.10!  Can you believe that?  I can't.  I won't pay a over a dollar for a soda waiting in line for a roller coaster, let alone at my work.  For a dollar ten I expect a fancy three-dimensional hologram cup, a frosted glass bottle, or a scoop of ice cream!

The list is included in Things a Man Should Know About Music: A Guide to 2004, a booklet featured inside the April issue, on sale March 16. Cities were judged on the quality of music scenes, stores and concert venues. Pittsburgh takes the top spot, followed by Denver; Minneapolis; Raleigh, N.C.; and Gainesville, Fla.

      Tom hates me for it, but I love  urlLink Around the Horn.   I love the addition of "Stat Boy", but the real reason I love it is Woody Paige.  It took me a long time to figure it out, but it hit me today.  He reminds me of my freshman football wide receiver coach.  Coach Johnson was crazy and yelled and got overly excited and that is exactly what Woody Paige does on ATH.  I remember a practice where the freshman team scrimmaged the JV team.  I ran a route over the middle of the field and got sandwiched by to linebackers as I caught the ball.  As the players cleared off of me, the only thing I remember was Coach Johnson screaming in my face.  I caught the ball and he was happy.  So happy, he literally dragged me the seven yards back to the huddle.  I was not on my feet until the huddle was already breaking up for the next play.  Good times.  It is that excitement that keeps me watching ATH.

      Ann and Elizabeth are throwing a dinner party tonight and I have been asked to make Pot Stickers.  I am not what most consider to be a good cook, or even a cook.  I have picked up the ability to make a mean pot sticker.  I first tried making the tasty treat after purchasing a package from the freezer section at Kroger.  They seemed simple and overpriced...I was right.  I quickly downloaded a recipe off the web and went at it.  The hardest part was finding all the ingredients.  Tonight will be my first mass cooking attempt.  Cross your fingers!  I will keep you updated with my  urlLink MoBlog !

      I began my packing for the big move this weekend.  I hope to get the keys this week. Saw the movie  urlLink "Eternal Sunshine..."  with Ann, Elizabeth, Annie, and Sonal.  Good movie.  Strange, but good.    My baseball game Saturday got postponed and moved from the Bellvue Vets field to the Newport Central Catholic field.  Possibly the best field I have played on in the  urlLink NKABL .  Not close to most Louisville fields, but not bad.  I was disappointed in the game.  To start I was in center field and batting 7th.  Arrrgh!  We lost 7-1.  I went 1-3 giving me a .429 average and three game hit-streak...from the seven-hole.    This week is going to be busy.  I have to get my muffler fixed and continue packing. Saturday my sister, Kelly, is graduating.  Stay tuned to the  urlLink MoBlog  for updates!

      The Northern Kentucky Mavericks opened the  urlLink NKABL  this weekend by splitting a double-header with the defending champs, C. White Tile.  The Mavs scored the winning run in the bottom of the seventh on a bases loaded wild pitch.  The 3-2 score made it the closest game in Mavs history.  The second game was not as pretty.  The Mavs took it on the chin 12-4.  The rubber game of the three game series will be completed on Sunday.    I went 2-4 with  2 RBIs and 2 BBs for the day.    My pitching stats did not look as good.  I entered in the second game already losing 6-2.  I went 3 up and 3 down with 2 strike outs in the first inning worked.  The first batter faced in the second inning fouled off about 15 pitches.  my arm was done.  A few "Should have been outs" later my runs allowed was matching that of Jimmy Haynes.  With no other pitchers to go to, I was in for the long haul.  It is okay though.  I think I proved I am more of a closer type pitcher and not a long guy.    Speaking of baseball, check out my  urlLink MoBlog  for the Ken Griffey Jr homerun picture I took.  Okay, it is about 30 seconds after the fact, but give me a break I am new at the camera phone thing.

      The mavericks dropped a double header to the Prophets today.  They should have warned us that it wasn't going to be fun.  I went 3-6 in the double header and bumped my average to .409 (9 for 22).

      I have played on several baseball teams, but the most fun was always the St. Albert baseball team.  My dad coached the team fom 4th to 7th grade.  We had practce twice a week all through the summer.  With virually the same team every year, my dad had to come up with new ways to make practice fun.  You can only play "chase the ball" so many times.  One of my favorite games was called "Game winning hit".    Game winning hit was very simple.  One person is batting, one person is on deck and the rest of the team is in the field.  We practiced on a universal baseball/softball field consisting of sand infield and a grass outfield.  The batter gets one pitch (from my dad) and in order to be a "game winning hit" it has to land or end up in the grass.  The defense had to start in the dirt.  There goal was to stop the ball from getting to the grass by knocking it down or catching it.  Every game winning hit is one point.  The player with the most points after several rotations wins.The game always had arguments over close calls and of course Trip Williams hitting a moon shot to the playground, but what it did was teach us situational hitting at a young age.  One pitch meant you couldn't be picky.  If it was a strike it then you better hit it and you better hit it hard.    This Sunday I got to put these lessons learned to the test.  It was the end of the second game of a double header in the NKABL.  We had tied the game in the 6th and in the bottom of the 7th I was up with men on 1st and 2nd with 1 out.  Of course the guy on second decides to steal third on the first pitch.  He was safe, but not what I would have done.  Now there is a man on second.  We send the guy on first to keep out of the double play.  I just miss the fastball and now have an 0-2 count.  One pitch left and the infiled comes in close.  I know he won't throw a breaking pitch because his catcher has been sketchy all game.  I am looking fastball outisde and will react on one inside.  Sure enough I get an outside fastball and I drilled it.  It one-hopped the wall in left center field.  Far enough for the outfielders not to turn around, but not as impressive as hitting it into the playground.  I am a cool 5 for 14 (.357).   We won our second game of the season to make us 2-6 on the year.   Not great, but just won win from a franchise record.

      This morning I walked out to my car and saw the guts of my dash board on the seat of my car.&nbsp; I closed the door and called the police.&nbsp; I didn't want to touch the car anymore because they may be able to get prints, or atleast that is how it is done on TV.&nbsp; As I waited for the Cincinnati Police to arrive I started thinking about the things I had left in my car.&nbsp; The first thought was my cd player and cds.&nbsp; I was almost sure they were gone.&nbsp; Then I realized that I had left my baseball glove was on the passenger seat.&nbsp;   I quickly went back to my car and was relieved that the glove was on the floor of the car with every piece of paper that had once been neatly placed in the glove compartment.&nbsp; After the police arrived I was able to go through and see what was still in the car.&nbsp; All baseball equipment was fine.&nbsp; My cd player, cds, ash tray, and coin holder were all taken.&nbsp; The car also reeks of cigerette smoke.&nbsp; My doors were unlocked and the police officer said that was a good thing because he didn't break the window.&nbsp; Of course, none of the other cars on the stree got broken into.&nbsp; He didn't find any prints because the car was wet from morning dew.   You can see the picture I took on my&nbsp;MoBlog.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      This weekend I am being adventurous and going to Red River Gorge.&nbsp; Ann has set up the trip.&nbsp; We are going with K$ and Marissa will be joining us later.&nbsp; I plan on coming back a night&nbsp;early so&nbsp;I can make my baseball double header on Sunday.&nbsp; It will be the 5th and 6th times we&nbsp;play C White Tile this year.&nbsp; We played them last week and you notice I did not write about it.&nbsp; It was that bad.&nbsp; First off we showed up with 7.&nbsp; Might as well call us the Generals again.&nbsp; Second we got blown out.&nbsp; I went 0-2 and Darryl and Matt had a screaming match in the dug out.&nbsp; Ahhh.&nbsp;   So anyway, we are going camping.&nbsp; I am not really a camping person.&nbsp; Well, I might be a camping person, but I have never really done it.&nbsp; I remember a cub scout camp out where I stayed with Dara, Tyler and Travis.&nbsp; That was a long time ago.&nbsp; In fact I think I went to a whole week of cub scout camp.&nbsp; I don't remember much.&nbsp; It was at Tom Sawyer Park and it was hot.&nbsp; I think I may have made a pocket knife holder out of leather.&nbsp; See, I told you I am not much of a camping person.&nbsp; I can't remember my one week of cub scout camp, but can tell you about every baseball team I have ever played on.&nbsp; Hopefully, I can get some good pictures for the site.&nbsp; I am not really sure what else you do when camping.&nbsp; Cook stuff?&nbsp; Look for arrowheads?&nbsp; Make leather goods?&nbsp; Guess you'll have to stay tuned to the moBlog to find out...they do have internet access, right?   &nbsp;

      It may have only been the one day before the release, but I got to go to the  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite  sneak preview last night...for free.&nbsp; Fox Searchlight's only pre-requisite was that I e-mailed an RSVP.&nbsp; I was the first one in line and in the theater.&nbsp; This would later come back to haunt me, but at the time I thought it was pretty cool.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The movie was great.&nbsp; It was a packed house and a great atmosphere.&nbsp; The movie was an instant classic and I urge everyone to see it as soon as possible.&nbsp; I am sure I will be&nbsp;seeing&nbsp;it with&nbsp;Ann (she decided that an opera was a better choice for a Thursday night...boy was she wrong) again this weekend.&nbsp; Besides the movie Fox was giving out all sorts of free stuff.&nbsp; I got a movie poster and a  urlLink "Vote for Pedro"  pin as I went in.&nbsp; Elizabeth had the scoop on the event and we were going to get a free t-shirt on the way out.&nbsp; I was hoping to get one with a liger on it or something, but because of my sweet seat we were the last ones out and they only had a size small tater tots t-shirt left.&nbsp; I was bummed.&nbsp; I am giving it to Ann, but think  urlLink eBay  may be a good option.  &nbsp;  After the movie, on their web page,&nbsp;you can take the quizzes and listen to movie quotes.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      On Monday the folks came up and we went to Kings Island. Good times.  I had a blast, but of course I did not suffer the whiplash that everyone else did.  One of my favorite rides at  urlLink PKI  is Adventure Express.  It is a small theme roller coaster.   The theme you ask?  Just a Safari tour gone wrong.  Before the ride you discover that track 2 is closed, but are assured your trip down track 1 will be just fine.  Then as the ride starts the car passes a sign that reads track closed and you see that you are on track 2.  I don't want to ruin the rest of the ride, but I will warn you...watch out for the big hill at the end!  Monday night I watched the Astros play on  urlLink ESPN .  I wouldn't usually watch an Astros/Padres match up on ESPN Monday Night Baseball, but Chris had just been called up and I was hoping to see him get his first hit.  He started on Tuesday (not on TV), didn't start on Wednesday (again on TV) and was sent down on Thursday.  Nice cup o'coffee.  He started the Futures game yesterday for the USA team, but evidently ESPN doesn't think the futures game should be played during a regular person's viewing hours.   The rest of last week I spent hanging out and getting little chores done.  Friday, Ann took the day off and we went to  urlLink The Beach Water Park .  It was awesome.  Ann was brave and rode on many things I thought she wouldn't.  Some rides she screamed so loud that even the life guards would crack a smile.    Sunday my  urlLink baseball game  was rained out.  Was it raining a half hour before the game.  No.  Was the field playable.  Yes.  'Nuff said.  I have to find a more committed league...or take up golf.  Sunday afternoon I watched Spiderman II with Ann and Elizabeth.  Ann loved it.  She has proclaimed that she will only watch sequels from now on.    That is all I have for now.  I will be working on some things for the web page.  So keep checking in...who I am kidding, you can't help but check in.
