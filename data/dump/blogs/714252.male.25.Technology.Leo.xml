Then me and sis went to The Capital for a drink. Bubbles turned up after getting his first pay check and (literaly) forced drink into us.. GAH.. I had shots and tequila beer (I'd never heard of it before either) and normal beer and all kindsa things.. Next thing I know we are in The Pod dancing to da funky hip hop sounds..  Did I mention my head hurts now?  WELL IT DOES

      After much debating with myself I have decided to improve the ASP engine for The .Bar.. I am going to add a User registration so people can edit their own posts and a couple of other nifty features, so please be nice to me if the site goes funky every now and again ;)

      LOL... My friend Sheila has to be the WORST web user I have ever met.. She can't find a home link when it is right on the page!  Maybe it's just me.. Do you find the site reasonably easy to navigate? If you don't..  urlLink Mail me !

      Phew.. It's 1:57AM here and I am EXHAUSTED but at least I got all my work finished..  Been working on a major customer for a few days and it has been driving me MAD trying to get the site closed.. Still have a few pieces to do but everything that is left is on their side now..  On site tomorrow and then I think I might see if I can organise a long weekend sometime soon.. (although I may just wait till the end of July.. I have my yearly week off for my Birthday then! 28/07 if anyone happens to be reading and caring at the same time ;P)  I think I have done all the tweaking I am going to do on the main site (for now) and I have to say I am really pleased with the way it turned out.. doesn't integrate the best with the blogs, but tbh I think I may just write my own blog engine if the site warrants it.. I don't think it will tho and this does fine for me :)  If you haven't seen Jonnys tribute page (created by a long time fan of my flatmate Jonny) then go to The .Bar main site and check out the links section.. FUNNEH!  K, going to bed now.. need sleep.. up in 5.30 hours.. must be mad.. actually, know I am mad, I am sitting here wibbling on at 2.02AM when I could be in bed sleeping already...  Stop typing Michael  DISCONNECT  It's only da Interweb.. Let it go.. GO TO BED...  heh.. Mad? Me?

He needs the validation ;P)  Karl still Blows (Mister I update my site everyday has dropped off the planet!)  Bubbles still takes it.. What you expect more text? He does exactly what it says on the tin :D  ANYWHO, going to go into town to get my Witness tickets tonight while I still can!

      Lo Lo Lo..  Have been too tired to update so :P  I would just like to take this oportunity to say what a great guy Jonny is and I think everyone should send him money for no reason.. You will feel better for it.. (God Damn Blackmail.. Have to get something on him for a change)  On a lighter note Karl and Bubbles have nothing (literaly) so I can happily tell everyone that Karl is a big Gay puff and Bubbles is his skanky ass cracker bitch :) Ahhhhhh that felt better  To summerize, Jonny rocks, Karl Blows, Bubbles takes it..

      Just read  urlLink Jonny's Blog  and just thought I would say that I heartily endorse his product and\or service and would recomend everyone else to try it.. I sent him 500 Euros and Within 24 Days I recieved 25,000,000 Euros!!!  *whispers to jonny, I am getting 25%. yeah?*   Also please note, Karl is a big girls blouse.. That is all :)

      Was just looking at  urlLink Karl's damp little corner  and I noticed him dissing our l337 bl0g1ng sk1llz ;)  Yes Karl you can get (and WILL need) a lock for your sleeping bag :)  I was in bits yesterday.. Was out on Sunday night (and how ;]) and only get 2 hours sleep so spent yesterday in a zombie like state.. Then got home and had a few drinks at The .Bar (No, I don't have a problem.. If there was no drink in the fridge\bar THEN I'd have a problem)  I have to say it is great having a fully stocked bar.. Makes me feel all warm (and ever so slightly tipsy)  Anywho going back to Salsa classes again to-night.. Haven't gone in well over a year so it might be a bit strange (My Ex-Fiancee's Cousin goes to them a lot) Bubbles has decided he wants to start doing the classes so we are gonna go get our salsa thing ON (And give ole' Dr. Rumba a hard time ;])  Anywho, will probably update my blog more than Karl will update his (The Pansy) so check mine first.. He'll understand..

      *Michael Settles in to try and finally write a proper update to his blog..*  Sorry about the lack of delays recently.. I spent the last two days living on Trains and I am spending two days next week on Planes and Trains so it will be kinda quiet then too..  First off my plans for the site.. I am going to try and get a proper server come next pay day! Wh0ot! so I can write the ASP code I wanna write and give you all the site you wish you had never found.. (I know, it's like this horrible crash that you can't stop staring at.. And so far we have done only 1/5th of the things we want to do with it..)  Plans for the site include a new Blogging engine that will allow anyone that wants one to sign up on the site and get one hosted here! (We're so generous) Also going to build a nice little forum (or use one of the other open-source ones that are out there.. depends on how things go on the female front really.. atm it looks like I will have more than enough time on my hands to build one myself from scratch..) so you can all abuse each other in a shared and easy to access area.. There are a few other plans I have afoot, but I need to see how feasable they are before I post anything solid.. (But personal image galleries does look like a distinct possibility..)  Now for a bit of personal crap.. Life is pretty good at the moment.. Going to witness with  urlLink Karl  and  urlLink Ash  which should be.... "fun".... ;)  Also the romantic life is slowly but surely coming together.. I'd tell you more but then someone would probably try to kill me..  Jonny somehow has eluded death so far.. I really am going to have to see what I can do about that REALLY soon..  BTW, if you want something to laugh at there is a good chance me and bubbles will be in the Sports Bar in Temple Bar pointing and laughing at Tony D and doing everything we can to help bubbles with his "itch"

      Grrrrrr I am going to KILL my flatmate.. he is going to die a slow painfull horrible death....He has stuck me on the bloody channel4 models website thing with THE worst picture he could find.. Death is too good for him..  I think this at the VERY least cancels out ANY possible Blackmail material out there!  GAH!  J00 are so dead..  Anywho.. Had the wierdest night last night.. Went to Hip-Hop Dance classes with bubbles and my little sisters which was fun.. Going to Salsa tonight which will also be fun :) and then I am going to eviscerate ash.. Pictures of the mangled corpse will be available on line as downloadable wallpaper, and for that authentic fan-boy feel buy the "I survived Jonnys evisceration" T-shirts and Mugs, complete with bloody corpse pictures!  GAH!!!  Oh yeah, I also was chatting to a girl online last night, showed her The .Bar site and she recognised me from the pictures! Turns out I had met her before in a club! Dublin is tooo freaky..

      Michael takes up blog space with jokes:  This morning, the Irish Independent can confirm that Sky Television has purchased the rights to the Sunday Mass. Although a staple of RTE for the past 40 years, the weekly Mass was poached by  Sky in a negotiating coup understood to be worth several million euro. Reached for a comment last night, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern told this newspaper,  "Ah, Jayzus, I'm gobsmacked." A source close to the Taoiseach said he hopes to  put pressure on the Catholic Church to ensure that the Mass will be available  to all TV viewers, not just those who subscribe to Sky, "at least on Christmas  Day". A senior Catholic Church source said that the Church was quite entitled to make  a commercial decision and to achieve the best deal possible. "We live in a  market society. Only the politically correct would expect us to turn down a  chance to maximise our earnings. This money will be used to develop our local  parishes throughout the country." It's understood that part of the package negotiated with Sky involves TV3. According to sources, the Angelus will transfer to TV3. A spokesman for the  station said, "We're delighted. This alone will represent a 30 per cent  increase in our home- produced programming." It's understood that TV3 intends to make the most of the move by increasing the  Angelus from one minute to 10 minutes. "And," said the TV3 spokesman, "unlike  bloody RTE, we'll be putting out the Angelus in prime time." It's understood that TV3 will move the Angelus to 8.30pm, in order to attract a  bigger audience. And there will be a 70-minute omnibus edition on Sundays. RTE will retain the rights to cover Papal visits and canonisations. The  Catholic Church source told the Irish Independent that the move represents a  new strategy. "Given the fall in vocations, we anticipate that it won't be long before live  attendance at Mass will be untenable it'll all be done over television. We've been assured that Sky will bring proper production values to the job,  with no more than three advertising breaks per Mass.  They've also promised to  provide a first-rate commentary team." Asked about the disappointment of young people whose parents can't afford Sky,  the Church source said, "Sure, they can always go to Mass at a nearby pub and  see it on the big screen." RTE was unable to provide a spokesperson. It's understood that the executive  responsible for negotiating the renewal of the Mass contract is on his holidays.

      Taken from  urlLink boards.ie/vbulletin - Humour :  Blow job Etiquette ( By a woman )   1. First and foremost, we are not obligated to do it.  2. Extension to rule #1- So if you get one, be grateful.  3. I don't care WHAT they did in the porn video you saw; it is  not standard practice to cum on someone's face.  4. Extension to rule #3- No I DON'T have to swallow.  5. My ears are NOT handles.  6. Extension to rule#5- do not push on the top of my head. Last  I heard, deep throat had been done. And additionally, do you  really WANT puke on your dick?  7. I don't care HOW relaxed you get' it is NEVER OK to fart.  8. Having my period does not mean that it's "hummer week" -get  it through your head- I'm bloated and I feel like **** so no,  I don't feel particularly obligated to blow you just YOU  can't have sex right now.  9. Extension to #8- "Blue balls" might have worked on high  school girls- if your that desperate, go jerk off and leave  me alone with my Midol.  10. If I have to pause to remove a pubic hair from my teeth,  don't tell me I've just "wrecked it" for you.  11. Leaving me in bed while you go play video games immediately  afterwards is highly inadvisable if you would like my  behavior to be repeated in the future.  12. If you like how we do it, it's probably best not to  speculate about the origins of our talent. Just enjoy the  moment and be happy that we're good at it. See also rule #2  about gratitude.  13. No, it doesn't particularly taste good. And I don't care  about the protein content.  14. No, I will NOT do it while you watch TV.  15. When you hear your friends complain about how they don't get  blow jobs often enough, keep your mouth shut. It is  inappropriate to either sympathize or brag.  16. Just because "it's awake" when you get up does not mean I  have to "kiss it good morning".   A Man's Rebuttal   1. First of all, yes you are obligated to do it. If you don't we will find someone (younger, prettier, and dirtier) who will.  2. Second, swallowing a teaspoon of cream is a hell of a lot  easier than licking a dead fish.  3. You want to talk about farting? does the word "queef" mean  anything to you?  4. I will use your ears as I see fit. Don't worry about it and  be thankful I'm not pulling your hair.  5. When you're on period, stuffing something in your mouth is  the only way to stop your bitching and moaning. Suck it up.  6. Speaking of which, if are bleeding for five straight days,  you need all the fluids you can get, trust me.  7. You bitch about the taste , but trust me when I tell you that  we get the **** end of the stick in flavor country.  8. At least there is no danger of a dick bleeding in your mouth.  9. Play with the balls.  10. No matter how good you think you are at it, we've had better.  11. Caress the ass, too. WE like that.  12. Make hay when the sun shines. It's "wide awake" in the  morning now, but when you get old and fat and looking for  some action, I gah-ron-tee it'll be "sound asleep".  13. I If you swallow, then you don't have to worry about getting any on your face, now will you?

      Hehe, It's 10AM, do you know where your children are?  If they are anything like Bubbles they probably just abandoned their mate for a swedish chick that they won't get any from ;)  (Yes, it would be different if he had got some.. THEN I'd understand ;)  Anywho.. Enough Bubbles bashing for the moment.. Hopefully I am going to start going to more if these wierd ass salsa classes on Thursdays and Sundays as well as the ole' faithfull Tuesdays.. (On Thursday they should be over just in time for me to pop accross the road to POD for some smooth Hip-Hop Action) Hopefully Omnipod and Bubbles are dancing away between the cubicles to get omnipod up to speed so we can go straight to the intermediate classes on Thursday\Sunday\Tuesday\whatever day we go again..  Anyway, no rest for the wicked so back to work for me..  Bubbles, put down that sheep porn magazine (Farmers Journal, he says he buys it for the articles..)  OK, You can go away now..  BTW, if you haven't seen them go look at the new pics in the pictures section, THEN go away..

      HeHeHe..  Myself  urlLink Omnipod  and  urlLink Bubbles  went to Salsa tonight and I have to say, it ROCKED... Had such a good night the general concensus (I.E. Me and Bubbles say so and poor omnipod just has no choice) is that we start to go to salsa on Thursday and Sundays too.. I say Wahey, lets do that salsa thing..  [Shameless plug for someone I know won't even see this]Go to  urlLink Salsa.ie  for more info etc..[/Shameless plug for someone I know won't even see this]  Just in case he does see this: Kosh, you're  bald , you're  ugly  and you  can't dance ... (Ditto goes for Bubbles and I  know  he is going to see this tomorrow ;)  Anyway, then Bubbles has to go meet a swedish chick so I tag along in case she brings a mate.. (Damnit she didn't) and we all head into Rí-Rá for a bit of a boogy.. I give bubbles the required space and go play some foosball..Not long later, Bubs must have scared her off 'cause she was heading off so Bubbles decides to make things worse and walk her home.. (hehe, Go on Bubs, Click that comment link ;) As he heads out the door he comes up to me on the Foosball table (another night un-defeated!! Wh0ot!) and says something while I am in the middle of a shot so i call him as I see him heading up the stairs, he tells me he is going to be back in a while..  1.15AM: Phone Vibrates in pocket 1:15AM and a few seconds: Hello? Bubs? 1:15AM and a few MORE seconds: Yeah, hey, I'm heading home 1:15AM and a fuck it you get the idea: BASTARD.. I woulda left half and hour ago if I'd know you weren't coming back.. Fuck ye anyway *  This is why I find myself sitting here updating my blogg at 2:02AM.. how's that for dedication??  Anywho, Have decided to do something for my birthday weekend after this so I am open to suggestions.. (well, not really, I have an idea what I want to do but I have to check to see if it is possible first.. Lawyers said they'd get back to me about the thing with the chickens..) Comment on the Blog here and the best suggestion will possibly maybe be done.. maybe.. and if I like you you MAY even get an invite**  K, begining to get rather tired so I am going to stop wibbling..

      OMG.. Those Bitches haven't updated their Blogs yet.. Poofters..  Even  urlLink Omnipod  has done SOMETHING with his blog more recently than  urlLink Jonnys  Bum-Chum for the weekend,  urlLink Karly  (Go Omnipod! My new favorite Blogger! I'll stick you on the main links tonight... probably.. maybe...)  Anywho, Witness rocked but now I am suffering the pain and agony of Sunburn and Hang-over.. I will sit down to-night to fill you in on all the details but I need to figure them out myself first..  Forgot to mention on my last post, went out with  urlLink Omnipod  and Bubbles on Friday night and as far as I know I got REALLY drunk.. Going to go read through  urlLink Omnipod 's blog to see if he has any idea what happened...

      OK.. I have almost gotten the whole Who wears short shorts thing out of my system ( urlLink Download it now! GO! NOW!! )  We now resume normal services.. (Or as normal as they get around here..)  Bubbles has been working on a new section for the site.. Random hot chicks we've seen around Dublin. A.K.A. Girls we'd like to fúck..  Also I am scanning in photos from the first of several disposable cameras bubbles has violated in the last week or two :) Can't wait to see some of THOSE pictures ;)  Have kinda stopped going to Hip-Hop classes for the moment, but have started going to Salsa 3 times a week.. *Raises eyebrow, swings head in Bubbles directions and assumes the "I dare you to open your mouth right now" pose, then turns to omnipod and says "same goes for you monkey-boy"* If I keep this up I'll be ready to leave the beginers class sometime in Q4 2003!! ;) (While on the subject of  urlLink Salsa,  Josh, change the font from Comic sans to Verdana Size 2.. GWAN.. You know it makes sense :))  *Hears Jonny make some smart comment about Salsa and Mikes sexual persuasion and throws a hardback book at the  urlLink little hitler * Actually.. I have to say, jonny really reminds me of Sadam from the Southpark movie as well for some reason.. "I can change, I love you.." Jonny, you buggered satan at all recently or have you not seen bubbles in a while? *Assumes a rock-like stance and gives Jonny the universal signal for "Just bring it"*  Actually no, I don't.. Jonny, you rock..  hehe hehe hehe  OK Enough flame baiting for now.. I'm off so you can go away now..  Oh Yeah, Bubbles get your cock out of omnipods ass for long enough to show him how to do those damn basic steps.. On Tuesday, we IMPROVE!  Go away now

      Jonny is talking drunkenly about me taking it up the ass while Karl gets dressed beside me.. It has been an eventfull night .. (Oh, news just in.. To Quote Jonny talking to Karl "You didn't complain last night!") I think we all know what that means :)  The guys are just getting up while I get to bed (and might I say Karl is wearing rather "funky" leopard skin underwear.. GWAN, you know you want to picture it ;P)  Anyway, last night I was in Salsa quite happy to be doing intermediate and finaly feeling like I might actually be getting the hang of it when I get bumped up to bloody advanced.. GOD-DAMNIT! I have to say it was kinda fun but really REALLY bad..  Then on to the POD to see Bubs, Richie and the Americans.. And then it happened.. The official sign of the end of the world.. The true sign that the end is near.. Richie. Got. Some. Must say though, the four horsemen are decent enough chaps once you get chatting to them.. Deaths a bastard when it comes to a hand of poker though. The little fuck has no eyes so bluffing comes easy..  Anywho, I also had a very nice night.. Julie has to be the STRANGEST most STUBORN American ever to be put on gods green earth.. We were in the POD and she got stuck because POD needs ID with credit cards and she had none on her, so I lent her the difference and told her to give it back to me Monday.. She freaked out a little bit and decided that she HAD to give me back the money tonight or she would have it hanging over her all weekend. Not only that but she insisted on coming out to me to give it to me.. (The MONEY Bubbles, The MONEY)  Interlude, Jonny talking to Karl; get the fuck out of the fucking way you fucking fuck.. the hotest couple in town have just left together for work.. So sweet...  Anywho, back to the main event. So Julie heads home from the POD and then her and Pete (Nice guy, refused to let her walk on her own) head out here, but being the Yanks they are they take the most FUCKED UP SKANKY ASS LOST ROUTE imaginable.. They actually ended walking back into town from Donnybrook to get to my flat and didn't realised how far wrong they had gone wrong... I wander down to meet Julie on the way and Pete has disappeared by the time I get there (Told you, Nice guy) He phoned me before heading off to make sure I met up with her and knew where she was.   Anyway, Me and Julie come back to my place and come into the sitting room to see Karl lying in a way that looks like he is humping the blanket.. I also think he MAY have been hanging out.. Either that or it was a long pubic hair.. god only knows..  Spend a while here relaxing (No.. I didn't "Bone the Bitch" Bubbles) and then we realise she is late for getting to her bus for the airport..Mad dash to get her home and to the bus and I still amn't sure if she made it or not... Ah well.. Shit happens.. (Especially when you know Bubbles.. Strange that)  K, It is 7:40AM and I STILL haven't been to bed.. Bubbles, please leave phoning me till after 3 if you can you sick demented twisted fuck (see I even complimented you)  Wow.. Long blog for a change..  Oh yeah, one other thing.. Turns out I am being sent to the wilds of Cork for a Salsa thing! /me is being trusted to hand out flyers in Cork at a salsa festival.. I feel so wanted..  K.. Sleep Must go to now..  echo off cls :top Echo "Zzzzzzzzzzz" Goto top  Wow, now I KNOW I am tired.. Geekdome awaits!  K you can all fuck off now, I need some sleep and you need to go do your own fucking blogs bitches...  And you all have small cocks (except the girls who would probably be happy just to see a small cock..)  Hmmm maybe that last comment was too much to soon, we hardly know each other.. Ah fuck it  Go away

Things have been interesting and for some god-forsaken reason I am being sent to Cork on Saturday to promote a Salsa weekend.. I have visions of Josh preparing to stitch me up by phoning ahead to tell them I am the best dancer they have and to make sure to get me to dance for them just so he can make me look like a complete ass (OK, Maybe he wouldn't do that, but then again I know we would do that to him :P)  Anyway, not much news.. I have being trying to behave myself a little bit recently but it obviously isn't coming up to the high standards of our groups conciounse (Yes, that would be Jonny and Karl of all people. OK so I spelt it wrong.. someone point out the proper spelling in a comment, GWAN)  Anywho, I REALLY have to dash now.. C ya on the flip side or some such bullshit statement..  Salsa classes tonight! Wh0ot!

      Wow.. I am exhausted and have quite a big blog to write so bear with me if I start to wibble..  Anywho.. Lets bring you all up to speed quickly (There will be facts in here I would rather not have getting to the general public so if you think you may read something you don't want to know.. Hell you'll read it anyway... won't you..)  Anywho.. About 2 weeks ago I met this really REALLY nice American Girl and we hit it off pretty much straight away but nothing happened.. at first.. A while after we met it was my Birthday and she turned up and we both got pretty wasted (in a good way) and ended up having a very nice kiss when I walked her home. It was a bit wierd in some ways because before anything really happened she had said to me that she was going hom ine 3 weeks and that I should know that it couldn't ever really be anything more than kissing and I said at the time that of course I knew what I was letting myself in for (you all know me well enough to know that I have been in situations like that before.. And it has never really been a problem..)  Anywho.. (Yes, that is the third time I have started a new paragraph with the word Anywho.. I think just to piss you all off I am going to make a point of starting every paragraph for the rest of this post with a woohoo. Give me any shit and I'll stop fixing my spelling mistakes too just to really freak you out.. You'll think you are reading a post on Bubbles blog ;P) Oh yeah and in brackets again.. (hmmm, This blog is rather heavy, isn't it.. If you are finding it too heavy feel free to skip to the end and I'll tell a joke :)  Anywho.. (hehe) I have to say I ended up quite taken with her.. She is one of the nicest girls I have ever known.. Bit wierd though because I still don't really feel ready to be in a proper relationship.. I thought that recently I had sorted out a lot of my feelings and that I might be ready to be in a serious relationship again but a few factors recently have caused me to wonder if I am really as ready as I think I am.. I am still stinging a bit from my last serious relationship, I would never really say that but I do miss Emma a lot still, I know things are better this way for both of us, but it's wierd still thinking about actually being in a relationship with someone else..  Anywho, the point my last paragraph is blatantly not getting to is that I am now left with some very wierd relationship issues to sort out and no idea how to go about doing that.. Guess I'll just have to do what I always do and hope the problem sorts itself out..  Anywho, about that joke.. Last night I lay in my bed, looking at the stars, the beautiful sky and the endless horizon..... And suddenly I thought.. Where's my Fucking roof?!?! Hmmm, maybe you should have stuck with reading the blog after all.. Quick side note.. Apparently Karl is a Cunning Linguist.. And he said something about a Master Debater.. I think he was probably refering to jonny there.. Looking forward to tonight 'cause we are heading to try out our Salsa Skillz on the poor innocent bystanders in the Gaiety tonight! Wh0ot! We'll have Karl ready for improvers on Tuesday by the end of the night no probs :)  K, That is enough of that for now.. I need sleep n' stuff..  Good Luck and Good night, this has been a Gambler wibble brought to you by the letters V and D and the number 69...  If you liked it, tell your friends you liked it, and if you didn't like it, tell your friends you liked it..  HeHe  You can Go away now

      HeHe, Long weekend and was lots of fun :)  Anywho..  Went to a Salsa thing in cork on Saturday (Which was the reason for my bitter twisted post I made on Saturday morning.) to hand out flyers for the Bundoran weekend (you know you want to go, all the cool people are going!) and had a mad weekend..  First off I went to an intermediate class that had an emphasis on "leading and following".. That was "interesting" to say the least but I have to say it really was quite good :)  Then Dinner with Daddy and Salsa teacher (yes, Helena.. Shut your mouth fat-ass) and on to a Salsa partay! The Night started out slowly but a few drinks later and Helena convinces me to enter the bloody Salsa competition. I end up entering the beginer level with another lady who has only had one class and had a great time :) We also came second which was GREAT.. The winner had been dancing for Just under a year so they had a LOT more moves than we did :) My partner was well chuffed :)  Anywho.. too tired to continue, going to bed for the moment :)

I went back to my desk and looked for something my flatmate would truly appreciate.. I went looking for a pictures of his favorite celebrity (and frequent star of several fantasies) naked...  It took me a while but eventually I found one..  Jonny, This ones for   YOU  ..

      Just reading my DNRC Newsletter ( urlLink Dilberts New Ruling Class ) and the intro to the Newsletter reminded me of Bubbles..   ________________________  I recently joined the ranks of hairless studs such as Bruce Willis and Andre Agassi, thanks to an aggressive mowing of my own dome. I remember the exact moment I decided to go for it. I was having lunch with two friends who had already blazed the trail to cue ball city. One of them - a notorious giver of nicknames -- referred to my old hairstyle choice as the "pink yarmulke." That pretty much sealed the deal.  The most shocking thing about getting a buzz cut (I didn't go all the way) is that you suddenly realize your head is much smaller than you ever would have imagined. I've developed a sudden fear of ping-pong. Unfortunately, my ears, nose and glasses stayed exactly the same size thus giving me a Mr. Potato Head look that I hope will one day become fashionable.  On the plus side, I find endless amusement rubbing my head with my hand. You would think I'd get bored doing that, but you would be mistaken. That's why it's taken me so long to write this newsletter; I'm typing with one hand.  I try to resist rubbing my head, but I don't have the willpower. I tried to cut down from two hands to one. That worked for a few days, but the next thing I knew I was slipping off a shoe and trying to get a foot involved. It's a small problem now, but I'm afraid it's like a gateway habit, a stepping-stone to worse addictions. I'm already eyeing other parts of my body and wondering how that stubble would feel. It's a sickness, really. _________________

      Man I am depressed for 2 reasons.. I just did a geek test and I found out I only had an 8% Geek rating.. Then I realised I was upset I only had an 8% blog rating...  I need help..     You are   8%   geek       OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae.

      OH MY GOD.. This just keeps getting better.. Have a look at  urlLink WilliamShatner.com - The Official William Shatner Website   From the main page: Hot Topic: Are there any Star Trek quotes that you find yourself using in everyday speech? I'm tempted to say "Engage!" whenever my daughter starts the car!  AND for a video called Mind Meld: Bill Shatner and Leonard Nimoy boldly go where neither man has gone before. This is the video that StarTrek.com calls "a strikingly candid conversation between two cultural icons."   This site is just hilarious

      Hey all, Interesting night :)  Salsa class was kinda slow (very slow) think I am going to start doing Josh's class on Tuesday as well as Thursday :( Scary I know..  I have to say. Girls confuse me at the moment.. The one I like.. Not interested... I think... (First bit of confusion) and there is a girl that is really nice... but I amn't interested.. Get on really well and hoping we can be friends but haven't decided if I want to see her or not. Might be able to but tbh (to be honest for the non-net-savy) at the moment I don't really see it.. Then there is "Relationship girl" who I amn't seeing at all anymore.  The Girl I am interested in is amazing but I think nothing is ever going to develop there. That is OK in the sense that we get on really well and we make great friends. I just have to try and figure out if that is definitly all that is going to be because I think we would make a great couple.. Hmmm I may just have to sit down and talk to her at some stage.. (Not now tho.. way too soon)  Ah well.. I am full of shit tonight.. Go read something interesting :)

      I have just found a site that I have to say is a GREAT idea..  urlLink Keen  is a site that allows you to register to provide advice over the phone for a HUGE selection of different subjects and you make money on a per minute basis for the phone call..  If you are a techie you can set up to provide support on your mobile at hours you choose by creating a schedule on any techie subjects you want (I am currently the Networking Guru ;) but you can do any subject (They even have psychics!)  HeHe.. Mad

      Hmmm. Work would be so much easier without customers.. I just had one of those annoying customers that know enough about computers to double guess and query every single thing I was asking him to do.. Then he would go off on this long boring rant about some obscure bug in XP (which wasn't even the operating system he was using..) Damn fewl kept me on the phone MUCH longer than was healthy..  Anywho.. back to tonights proceedings.. Meeting OP at my place for a drink or two while I get ready for Salsa tonight.. If anyone reading this is going to Salsa tonight, hit on his friend Ciara, it will REALLY get on Nats nerves ;P  Looking forward to my class tonight, I was so bored last night that I actually considered trying to learn some steps off the Salsa video.. (I hate trying to learn things from a video.. Seems pointless to me.) Hopefully Vivienne will be teaching the class tonight buit who knows (actually Carmel did a really good class a few weeks ago too.. hmmmm)  OK, I am definitly starting to wibble... Think I'll wander off and have a look at bubbles blog to see what mayhem he is causing.. wanna see if he put up anything about his parents reaction to the site :) He showed it to them last night :-o  OK, you can bugger off now :)

Officially single in the true sense of the word again and not quite sure where to go next. Looking forward to Salsa tonight, should be interesting to see how things go with Helena :)  K, on the phone with a silly customer, blog more later.

Also sorted out things with Helena. We are officially not seeing each other at all any more.. Was good we got that sorted out at this stage before things got violent :)  K, enough piss ant crappy blogging, go read something more interesting god damnit.  P.S.

         schadenfreude  \SHOD-n-froy-duh\,  noun :         A malicious satisfaction obtained from the misfortunes of others.           That the report of Sebastian Imhof's grave   illness might also have been tinged with   Schadenfreude     appears not to have crossed Lucas's mind.  --Steven Ozment,   Flesh and Spirit           He died three years after me -- cancer too   -- and at that time I was still naive enough to imagine that what the   afterlife chiefly provided were unrivalled opportunities for unbeatable   gloating, unbelievable  schadenfreude .  --Will Self,   How The Dead Live           Somewhere out there, Pi supposed, some UC  Berkeley grad students must be shivering with a little   Schadenfreude   of their own about what had happened to her.  --Sylvia Brownrigg,    The Metaphysical Touch        The historian Peter Gay -- who felt  Schadenfreude  as a Jewish child in Nazi-era Berlin, watching the Germans lose coveted gold medals in the 1936 Olympics -- has said that it "can be one of the great joys of life."  --Edward Rothstein, "Missing the Fun of a Minor Sin,"    New York Times   , February 5, 2000      Schadenfreude  comes from the GeGerman from  Schaden , "damage" +  Freude , "joy." It is often capitalized, as it is in German.

      Hmmmm...  OK.. Strange weekend to say the least.. My room has never seen so much action without actually seeing any action.. Poor Jonny must be as confused as fuck.. will have to bring him up to speed tonight when I get home :)  Anyway.. I think for the sake of me sanity\health I may have to try and cut back a bit on the old gurls.. I am just digging myself a kind of bottomless pit that I will never be able to get back out of.. (And what's worse it may fuck with my Salsa!) I hate all this crappy side of things.. I was looking for a bit of fun and instead I am in the middle of a potential girly armageddon.  Anywho, I am absolutely wrecked today.. The weekend was also breaking point for me.. I can normally handle being out every night but I think a combo of stress over various female related issues and exhaustion from dancin and not sleepin have drained the reserve power and left me in need of a serious recharge.. No all I have to do is find the time to recharge between trying to start my own business and unravel the nightmarish double-hamerlock that is my "love" life..  hehe.. "love" life.. I wish..

      HeHe.. OK Time for a semi serious blog :)  I got some news today about the ole' Family tree but before I tell you all about it lets have a Mikes Family tree 101 class ;)  First of my Dad. A few years ago my old man was looking through some old photo albums and he saw a picture of himself standing with his older sister.. Only problem was he was 30 something and she was only 10.. Turns out Granny had a fling with my Aunts God-Father (Wonder what the church would have to say about that ;P) and Daddy dearest is the product of the affair so to speak :) So right there it turns out all my Aunts and Uncles and Cousins on that side of the family are really all halves if you get me. Also turns out I have a whole load of relatives I have never met.. Interesting eh?  With me so far? Good, now to talk about my "immediate" family.  My Mum Married my Dad (as you do) and they had me and my two sisters. About 18 years ago they got seperated and that was that for the moment :) Then about 7-8 years ago my Dad decide to have a child with an ex of his (at the time he was to be the sperm donor for someone who wanted a baby, but he was going to do the AI the old fashioned way if you get my drift ;) but of course all this with an ex... They end up getting back together before Little Bro is born (David, he kicks ass)  So Current state of play: Me, Linda, Claire (my two sisters) and my Half-Bro David.  Anywho a couple years on and my Dad and Davids Mum Mags have split up and Mags gets together with Barry (The Ferryman for the Island they live on..) They are very happy together and have a daughter together, Niamh.  How does this affect the family tree? Hard to figure out exactly but basically I have a half brother called David, he has a half sister called Niamh but Niamh is no relation to me.. (At least best I can figure she isn't..)  Phew, this is starting to hurt my head..  Anyway.. The reason for this blog is my dad called me the other day to inform me of another knot in the family tree.. Turns out his girlfriend claire (no, not my sister you sick sick people) is pregnant so I am due another little brother\sister in about 6 months time..  Someday I am going to try and draw this nightmare up and see what it looks like, I just can't figure out how to put 3 mothers and one father in the same family tree diagram, let alone how I am supposed to figure in Davids other sister and the extended families there...  EEEEKKK..  Anywho, that little blog should keep you lot happy for the moment ;)

It looks like the Salsa Jet might become something they do every two months which would be EXCELLENT if they pull it off (And Josh hasn't barred me...)  Anywho, back to work for the moment.. If possible I will try and write a full blog later (Yes, I do know I left out all the Juicy details.. Go Suck a lemon)

      Lo Lo Lo.  Yes two updates in two days.. Must be Christmas or Hanukah or some such.. (Yes, you're right, I can't spell.. At lease I know how to use the delete key though.. /me looks sideways at bubbles)  Anywho.. Nothing spectacular has really happened since my last splurge of consciousness to this damn blog.  I went over to a friend of Helenas last night and we all watched the Fight Club DVD (Helena hadn't seen it before) and then went home.. Very exciting I know..  Am looking forward to salsa tonight tho, especially since I missed the academy on sunday..  Have also organised to go to my Dads for the weekend, going down on Friday (Yes Bubbles, you can stop sniggering now.. I said "going down") and coming up in time for the Academy on Sunday. That should make for an interesting Blog because Helena is coming down with me (Coming down is probably a better way to phrase it with bubs in the room) and has yet to meet the mayhem that is my father dearest. Also my first time down since I heard that Claire is pregnant (for those that haven't seen the earlier episodes, Claire is my Dad's Girlfriend and explaining the rest will just take too long.. You can read it again  urlLink here . Go have a quick looksie if you are bothered\bored.  Anywho.. Introductions to my mad father and a weekend in cork should make mondays blog a must read event ;)  K, going to go back to being pissed off at my job for a while :-/  Go away now

      HeHe, OK.. I think I have time to do a semi decent blog today!  What's been happening? Hmmm.. Well, I have 4 weeks left in work so I am starting to really focus on exactly what it is I am going to do in a few weeks time. As usual I am super duper organised and rearing to go.. hehe, yes that does mean I haven't got a clue where I am going first.. Million things to do and no idea what order I am going to do them in.. Oh well..  Weekend was good. On Friday evening I got EVER so slightly drunk.. Not like me at all, I know. I went to a freaks and geeks drinking session with a load of the  urlLink boards.ie  mods and users which was "interesting" to say the least (finaly met a friend of mine from the states that I have never actually met IRL before) and managed to scare Helena and her friend Liam (Sheep Shager from New Zealand).. They had never met a group of people that introduced themselves by their nicknames before (With the exception of bubbles)  Anyway, we were there for an hour or two and then headed over to the Capitol to have drinks with Jonny Karl and the boys before they head of on holidays (The bastards) and got merrily pissed there. Poor Helena had a black russian spilt all over her after "Dave" was made jump by Bubbles head-giving antics and I kissed Liam.. (Yes, the Sheep Shager from New Zealand) I almost took the guys eye out in the process but I think he still loves me anyway. After that we went to Rí-Rá (Me, Helena and Liam) where they actually beat me at Table-Footy (I claim alcohol poisoning) but I did go on to trounce them several times after that.. Wh0ot!  Then Sunday came around.. HeHeHe.. Where to begin..  First off I had been invited last weekend to a trip to Glendalough with Helena, Liam, Emer and Claire to have a walk in the area and do the whole touristy thing with my favorite New Zealander.. Yes, you guessed it, my secret love... Liam... Well, actually it isn't that secret really is it.. Anyway.. During the week the invitation changed a little bit and I was invited to lunch in avoca handweavers with the gang AND Helenas Mum and Dad.. OK.. I have met them before and things are going really REALLY well with Helena.. Meeting the parents can't be that bad, may as well get it over and done with. Anyway it isn't the first time.. I did a quick "Hi, How are you? Oh is that the time? Must go to Salsa" last Tuesday and they seemed very nice.  What the Hell  Let's meet the parents...  What it turned into was a regular Clan gathering.. I was sitting with the aunt on one side, Helena on the other, one cousin diagonaly accross from me on one side, Helenas sister opposite me (but I like her so that wasn't too bad) and the mum diagonaly accross from me on the other side.. Then The Dad, Uncle and another cousin on the next table down with Emer and Liam (Ahhhh, Sweet Liam..)  HeHe Actually I have to say it was actually very nice.. The parents were very friendly (didn't get talking to the dad really, but he didn't seem to hate me yet! Wh0ot me!) and the Aunt had no idea who I was.. asked me twice if I worked with Helena in the process of fishing for info.. Was quite funny really because I didn't volunteer any info either ;) (HeHe.. Hi Helena, how are you ;) I didn't say anything bad about your family at all...)  Anyway, after that it was the walk around the monastery and the lower and upper lakes in Glendalough.. Very nice I must say.. And we managed to finish the walk and get in the car JUST as it started to lash rain.  I had hoped to make it to the academy salsa class but unfortunately I was exhausted by the time we got back to Dublin and had missed half the class anyway so me and Helena had a nice evening watching very bad things on video. (was kinda disapointed with that film actually.. oh well) and then just watching tv.. Was very couple-ish behaviour ;)  And then there was today.. So far so good but hey, lets see what happens later. Going to go watch Fight Club on DVD in Emers later with Helena, Emer, Claire and sweet sweet Liam :D  K, That will have to do you for now :) Talk later :)  "Big G"  hehehe what are you doing still reading.. Go Get lost...

      I know.. I'm getting lax in my updating.. Screw you ;)  Anywho.. Not a LOT has happened really.. I have started looking up PHP coding sites again for the SEM site and hastling Josh about the salsa congress site he wants me to work on.. Also have started hitting on friends (not like that) to see who knows people with small companys that need computer stuff done (I know there are some out there damnit! I KNOW IT!)  Also started looking at our internal security before I leave here, wanna make sure I leave a tidy network for my succesor :) I had forgotten how much I enjoyed all that stuff. (No I actually amn't being sarcastic)  Apart from that all is kinda boring.. Going to Cork for the weekend tho to see my Dad and the new mother to be (Not my mother, Dad's GF is preggers.. See  urlLink here  for my previous blog with all the GORIE details..) seeing as I haven't seen them since I heard the news.. Will probably try to hit my Dad up for some potential customers too..  K, I have to go clean my desk and remove all the porn from my hard disk just in case anyone goes snooping while I am out next week.. You never know what will happen when I only have two weeks left :)  Go away.

      HeHeHe.. OK.. Yesterday was interesting, I spent most of the day working on Ideas for a database engine for the "Salsa Electronic Magazine" ( urlLink http://www.irishsalsa.ie/ ) and helping the lovely Alison with some ASP code stuff.. Then last night bubbs came over and we watched (drooool) Geri on last weeks Boston Public (I still had it on video.. FOR JONNY of course..)  Then Helena got out of her Dinner thingy (not after trying to tell me that I hadn't given her a rescue call on time when I had.. Thank God vodafone put time stamps on the answering machine messages..) and I went over to her place..  I have to say. Staying at Helenas has its good side and its bad side.. (Leave it!!!) On the good side I get up early and get to work early.. On the Bad side I have to get up early..  I AM EXHAUSTED today.  Anywho.. I managed to post a reasonably decent sized blog with no mention of the, eeek I almost said it ;)

      ROFLMAO.. First things first.. This site is HILARIOUS! Has tons of sexual positions (no I don't want a load of comments relating to the percentage of positions you have tried.. I probably beat you all anyway so NYAH!) and the links to his "other works" are great.. The Jive Kama Sutra had me laughing my ass of for AGES.  urlLink Sexual Positions Free - Learn Some New Sexual Positions   OK.. Back to normal broadcasting now (etc. etc. etc.)  Just back from Limerick which was a good weekend but terrible two days work.. I'm still a bit emotional about it so I will leave talking about it till I have worked it out on something breakable :) On the plus side last night turned out great..  I TOUCHED GORDON BOOBIES! Yes, I know.. Not everyone can appreciate why this is a good thing and to be honest I amn't sure myself.. Gordon seems to have somehow "slotted" (either he slotted himself or we slotted him, not quite sure) into a near god like position of reverence.. I blame the Polo Mints.. Unfortunately he has kindly requested there be no more touching of the boobies, but as bubbles so kindly pointed out that just means we have to move on to his ass..  Hmmm A whole paragraph dedicated to the Big "G".. I like it :)  What else has been happening.. Oh yeah.. I have only 2 more days before I break free of the shackles that are my current job.. From Friday at 16:30 I am no longer an employee of this "fine" establishment but go on to newer better things as a self employed type person! PPL keep asking me if I am nervous but so far I am just excited (and not just by the touching of the boobies!)  Also I have decided to go to an audition next week for salsa dancers for a Disney movie! :lol: It should be a good laugh because there are a good few ppl going to make it a laugh  Also I have had an intriguing Idea.. After reading Twangs comments on Shellys blogs I have decided I really want to give twang a blog.. If you are reading this twang, CONTACT ME! Please please please please please start bloggin' :)  K, That will have to do for now. Bugger off

      K, I really don't have that much time to blog this week I am afraid.. sorry to all the ppls who bother to read this hunk of junk...  Anyway.. Not going to give a blow by blow of the weekend and week so far, just the highlights  Had a Great pissup after my last day of work, was great fun when I got to Rí-Rá because I hadn't been there in ages and a mate I hadn't seen in even longer was "on the decks" so I basically got to hear whatever I wanted all night.. Suddenly it became a hip-hop night! Woohoo!  Then I recovered nicely on Sat morning and had lunch with my GF and my mother dearest and a trip to see XXX. (It does EXACTLY what it says on the tin so I was a happy camper.. I also got to see the trailer for Twin Towers (The LOTR version) and the next bond movie.. I was Very happy at that point so the movie really was a bonus) After that it was home, change back into town to meet Karl for a drink or two before the others got in (we congratulated ourselves on our new found freedom!). Shelly and Tasha turned up next (Rarrrrr) closely followed by Bubbs and eventually all the others (read bubbles blog for a list, I'm lazy)  Me and bubbs did our funkay thing and had a good laugh, got to touch gordon boobies briefly (I am trying to cut down now, i swear!)  Don't REALLY remember a lot after 4 Dame to be honest (I do know what the stick is about though.. Wouldn't shelly like to know ;P)  Sunday was good, was one of the few that forced themselves to make the first class in the pouring rain (mostly because I was supposed to talk to Josh about some web-site stuff and then he never turns up! GAH!) but had an ok class anyway.  Monday was first day of work.. I was kinda flakey to be honest (probably stil recovering frmo Sat) but we got a LOT done. Tuesday was Audition and movies day.. Everyone else will have a little rant about it anyway so I am going to just say HEHEHE it was FUN! Then lastnight at salsa I got over my not dancing thing... Maybe the whiskey helped a little but it was still good damnit!  K, off to do some more "work"

The company is officially registered and I have my company card!  urlLink Have a peek at the card!  Also got the Bank account all setup and we are about to send out our first invoices! Woohoo!

I have been flat out working on the company during the day and too broke to do anything at night but will get myself sorted on that end very soon thankfully!!   Anywho.. At some stage today we SHOULD have the rough site up and running (maybe tomorrow but hoping today).

I am getting pretty damn tired of all this shaving and have phoned loads of clinics but they all have a "No Ball's" policy. Last place I called I asked if there was a medical reason and they said it was probably because there are no male hair removal type nurses!  Anyone have any ideas???

New company is going really well (Have a look at  urlLink the site since we tweaked it ;)  not much has changed but there are a few things..) and we have just moved into real offices! Our new guy started on monday too.. Seán is wierd, very wierd, must get him a blog!  Aynwho, all this means that I have gotten myself set up in work at last and as long as our new phone lines go into the office tomorrow (Please please please..) I may actually get the occasional chance to blog from work soon! If not I will at least try to check in semi regularly.  Anywho, Catch you all later ;)  Mike  P.S. Jonny has a small penis Jonny has Crabs, Jonny gets really crabby when his PMT kicks in Jonny likes to hump dead animals in the sitting room pretending they belong to a "friend" (You know what I am talking about Jonny..

      Just got this in my mai and thought I'd share :)  If you cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq.  If the markets are a drama, bomb Iraq.  If the terrorists are frisky,  Pakistan is looking shifty,  North Korea is too risky,  Bomb Iraq.   If we have no allies with us, bomb Iraq.  If we think that someone's dissed us, bomb Iraq.  So to hell with the inspections,  Let's look tough for the elections,  Close your mind and take directions,  Bomb Iraq.   It's pre-emptive non-aggression, bomb Iraq.  To prevent this mass destruction, bomb Iraq.  They've got weapons we can't see,  And that's all the proof we need,  If they're not there, they must be there,  Bomb Iraq.   If you never were elected, bomb Iraq.  If your mood is quite dejected, bomb Iraq.  If you think Saddam's gone mad,  With the weapons that he had,  And he tried to kill your dad,  Bomb Iraq.   If corporate fraud is growin', bomb Iraq.  If your ties to it are showin', bomb Iraq.  If your politics are sleazy,  And hiding that ain't easy,  And your manhood's getting queasy,  Bomb Iraq.   Fall in line and follow orders, bomb Iraq.  For our might knows not our borders, bomb Iraq.  Disagree? We'll call it treason,  Let's make war not love this season,  Even if we have no reason,  Bomb Iraq.

       Newsflash Blog inspectors return from deepest darkest boobania.. Inspectors are cautious but believe that gord a n has probably got no comments of mas destruction but they are worried that he may have a mobile comments lab.  They do believe that he may be using these mobile labs (that he may or may not have) to research the possibility (or not) of constructing "nuculler" comments.  America are still pushing to invade but for the moment the world is willing to watch and wait...

       Testicle Update! I was thinking about either  	A) Phoning the Salon on Channel 4 and asking if they do genital laser hair removal  Or   	B) Finding out if a salon would be willing to train\show me\a friend how to do it and see if they will let me rent their equipment for my equipment  Unfortunately things are looking grim for option A.. Helena begged me not to do it because she couldnt handle it if her parents channel hopped to E4 just as my balls were getting done!  Option B will take a lot of persuading I think.. Hopefully I will be able to get phoning around places again next week in a vain attempt to find someone foolish enough to leave me and possibly bubbles alone in a room with a laser..  Hehe

      Hmm, my last blog didna post.. Oh well.. go read that first then come back here for a serious post!  Here's todays post.. Was browsing the web and found some white supremacist sites (gimme a sec to explain...) I had been watching RTE the other night and saw what was without doubt the worst piece of reporting ever.  There had been a murder and the police were "looking to speak to a nigerian man in connection with their enquiries".. They had released a picture which was shown on the news but then straight after they went to random shots of black people walking the streets of Dublin!  This was the worst thing I had ever seen.. If you had a report of a white man wanted in connection with etc. etc. etc. they wouldn't show random shots of a white man taking money out of the ATM etc.. I was so annoyed I actually decided to complain and do some research on the whole Irish racism thing when I found  urlLink This site .. It is horrible. A white supremacy group organised and running in Ireland.. Not only that but I found more! There was also the Storm Front organisation ( urlLink Here is the irish section of their site )  One glimmer of hope did come out of all this though.. On the nsrus site I did find their two primary contact numbers are mobiles!! So here I include the number you need to ring to go straight to their answering machine (so you don't have to pollute your ears with their racist voices)  Ireland direct call ~ 08757654682 ~ Dublin Direct ~ 08651975717  Or if you feel like like annonymously texting use  urlLink this site  with these numbers:  Ireland direct call ~ 0877654682 ~ Dublin Direct ~ 0861975717  Go play with the nasty racists!

      HeHe.. Ok Sorry about the brief lapse.. Things have been mad. Spent weekend in deepest darkest westport trying to come up with good excuses for not entering the competition.. Why do people not understand why I don't want to make an ass of myself infront of hundreds of excellent salsa dancers??  Anywho..  All is good but still no sign of laser treatment.. In the mean time I gave up and tried another alternative to shaving my testes.. (No Bubbles, It didn't involve any honey OR small furry animals.. But now that you mention it...) Last week I tried Immac! I have to say Jonnys reaction was the best.. He started to give out to Helena for leaving "Them wimmin products" in our bathroom and his face when I told him the "scrapper thingy" was mine! LOL!!! Anyway.. You are probably wonderin' what the results were like (or screaming NO! NO MORE INFORMATION!) and I have to say I was very pleased.. I think next time (tonight) I will have to try using more cream because I think I didn't use enough but it did a really good job.. Very smooth and none of the stress sharp implements down there usually bring to my healthy lifestyle ;)  K, Gotta go get home and fed...

      OK. I am giving up.. There is NO-WHERE in this BACKWARDS country that will do "that kind of thing"... I Hate you all  But seriously, if anyone is interested I have a great idea.. I'll try to back someone in all the training they need to do laser hair removal and then help them market the service to the fetish community.. I tell you, if you sell it right there's money to be made! (And I want my scrotum done damnit!) I'm sure we could organise with an existing clinic that has the equipment to rent it for the day once a week...  Anyone interested? PLEASE!

      We just had an april fools prank played on us..  I got this letter in the mail this morning:  urlLink    (Click for a full size picture)  I phoned a few people for advise and then called the golden pages to talk to the guy and found out there was no-one there by that name... So what do I do next? Well, Karl hadn't turned his phone on yet (he was off shagging last night) so I had left him some messages before I found out it was a prank and I decided to not tell him that it was a prank.. Kept him freaked out all the way into the office and then when he got in I explained that the fact we were a limited company put some awkard new angles to the whole situation and that the company secretary (Karl) had to phone Mr. A. Lyon (their legal guy) at a phone number I gave him.. When he phoned he got through to the Dubiln Zoo :)  It was a fun morning I have to say :)  Mike

      I just don't get some people.. Why do they go to a blog and read it, hate what they read, then come back and read it some more.. It's like they have such a sad life that the only thing that keeps them going is finding things to bitch about in other people.. What is the point in that I ask you?

      Quick Blog.. Have been feeling weird recently, kinda depressed yet kinda numb so please excuse if I come across stranger than usual these days..  In other news, Jonny and myself have been resurrecting the flat. We abused our neighbours skips last night and the night before to get rid of all our street signs, life preservers, TVs that havent worked since Nixon etc. and the flat is actually coming together nicely  We re-arranged furniture and have put a bit more emphasis on The .Bar as well as building a shelf using nothing but bottles of JD. So hopefully the place will be spick and span come the party on Saturday night.. Now if only I could start getting to sleep at night.

      Three blogs in one day!  It must be something in the air..  Anyway, this blog has nothing to do with tities for a change.. I am blogging about something I have been argusing over in the Forum.. What people can\can't and should\shouldn't say on their blogs..  My main point in all the discusions has been that someones blog is their own to do with as they please.. They choose what they want to write with the full knowledge that it is on the internet.. Anyone can read it.. I once had a completely anonymous blog that no-one but my closest friends had the address to and I gave out no personal details that could trace who I was.. Now that I have this blog I use some discretion (It may not look like it but to me posts about my testicles and titie bars aren't a big wow..) because I know there are people reading who may get hurt by the things I have to say.. That's my choice.. I could also choose to say exactly how I feel about anything I wanted and fuck the consequences.. The key thing here is my freedom to choose.. I choose to be discreet and Nat decided not to be discreet.. He never hid the fact that he was being honest on his blog, he just decided no to tell certain people it was there..   Should  he have been a bit more discreet? Probably but as I said, he decided to say what he felt with no holds barred..  Did he do it for some sort of "Big Up" from the lads? He may have, I don't know and don't really care.. Again it is his choice to do something foolish..  Do  you  have the right to argue with him and tell him exactly what you think of him on his blog\the forum? Of course you do.. How would you feel if I told you that you  can't  say waht you wanted on his blog and started censoring you?  Anyway, that is enough ranting for this hour.. Come back later for a lecture on the benefits of shaving your testicles..

      Just a quick follow up blog.. Managed to get time to read what I wrote last night (I repeat words a lot in the same sentence when I am Drunk..)  Anyway.. Looking back on it with the light of day making my eyes squint.. It was an intriguing experience I have to say and one I would probably repeat if I could get a budget option ;) And it was strange to see the way the whole thing worked.. A completely bizarre experience the way there are all these girls wearing very little wandering around waiting for someone to pay them to take what little clothing they have off.. And it still wasn't very arousing.. I didn't even get a semi-stiffy.. The dance I had was with an amazingly pretty girl.. Her breasts were really nice (small yet pert is probably the best description) and she could definitely move but I think it was too clinical an experience.. I have had more arousing dances on the dance floor in a club with girls that had a LOT more clothing on..  It definitely brings a new angle to the whole arousal thing for me..  Anyway, back to work for me..

      I wrote this at 4AM when still drunk and haven't read it yet.. I also have to go straight to a meeting so I haven't got time to read it now before I post so you get the pure, Mike at 4AM Drunk after being in a strip club.. Usual Disclaimers apply before reading further..  So..  It's 4:35 AM and I'm more than a little bit drunk\disorientated..  I'm writing this on my home pc to save to disk and stick on my blog in the morning so ignore any\all spelling mistakes and weird comments.  Tonight I went to my first strip club, it was an interesting experience. Jonny decided he was determined to get me my first ever lap dance.. I know a lot of people will be surprised to know I have never been to a lap dancing club before but hey.. Looks can be deceiving..  Anyway, Jonny decided for me on a nice girl (and I have to say.. she was incredibly cute) and she came over and invited me to a back room for a "dance".. I said ok and wandered towards the back of the club when she mentioned it was 100 Euro for "15 minutes"..  WHAT?!?!? 100?!?! Oh god no... so politely turned her down and she goes on to tell me it is 75 Euro for 10 minutes.. "no Thank you" And so she drops the price to 50 for 3 minutes.. At that I just return to my table.. Then The J Master has other ideas.. he goes up to her and pays the 50 up front and she comes down and invites me to a "private area"  And this is where things got very dissapointing.. I have to say my "dancer" was incredibly cute but it just didn't really get me going really.. The whole dance was very "nice" but it didn't really turn me on more than the basic "wow.. nice breasts.."  Maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind but to be honest it was less than I would have expected from something that should have made me feel sexually frustrated for the next few weeks minimum..  K, I am going to bed now.. I may blog again at some stage if I actually get it together enough to actually post this blog in the first place ;)

      Interesting Weekend..  Friday I had a bad day in work and went for one drink in Toast.. SEVERAL pints later I end up plastered and confused..  Saturday I went out to my mummys for the day which was cool.. Only problem was my mum went down to the shop and my sister was asleep on the couch so I decide to go raid the fridge (As all good children who go to visit their parents house for the afternoon are obliged to do.. It's a tradition or an old charter or something..) and I see this lovely looking Pasta, Tuna and Sauce dish.. One microwave and 3 minutes later I am eating a tasty piece of Tuna loving pasta..  Mum Comes back and goes into the Kitchen, looks at the battlefield that is the kitchen sink and turns to me.. "Michael, (Mum always uses my full name..) You didn't east the pasta did you?" HeHeHe.. Turns out she meant to throw it out the day before :) This leads to problems I will deal with when I get to sunday..  Then after mums I head into town to meet up with Bubbles and go on the great birthday tour of 2003. Into JRB's (GAH.. HATE HATE HATE.. IT BURNS MY EARS..) for a while.. I start getting this allergic reaction type itch to leave very early in the evening.. Then onto the Q-Bar to hook up with the ever beautifull Shelly and her friends and sister.. As Bubbles said the similarities were un-canny.. Anywho.. That was fun, Q-Bar had surprisingly good music considering but OMG was it hot in there (so take of all your clothes.. etc. etc. etc.) but it still wasn't quite shooters so after some gentle persuasion (Bubbles, put the bat back..) we all move to Shooters..  Shooters was GREAT fun.. Some of the Salsa crowd (Helena, Vicky, Agnello, and Flat top dude whose name I never remember, sorry) were there.. I love it when Agnello comes to a hip hop night because he is just so much fun to dance with.. He really is doing it just for the fun of it as opposed to a lot of ppl there who are doing it to be seen.. It always makes for a much more fun night when he's around..  There was a bit of a scene at one stage where Richie and Shelly had a bit of a falling out and I tried (foolishly) to try and smooth things out a bit.. I think it all got sorted out in the end though.. Ended up sleeping on Shellys couch which was interesting.. My Neck still hurts a bit but the night was worth it :)  Then on Sunday I had to get from Shellys to my mums in 30 minutes.. NOT an easy thing to do on a sunday.. I was only slightly late and had an interesting afternoon with my dad and my sisters.. On the bus into town with my Dad I ended up talking to him about various relationships I have had in my life (including the time I was in a "threesome Relationship for four months.. Not the kinda thing you normaly tell your dad about..) and we talked about how similar we are when it comes to relationships.. Scary thought really.. My dad has three kids by my mum, another one by another woman and one from his current GF (and is planning another one).. For a greeny he isn't helping the global population problem much, is he? The final thing we came up with is that we both have a huge problem saying no in a relationship.. We aren't good at being the person who causes hurt, so much so that we will get ourselves into a situation where we really aren't happy but it's easier to be unhappy ourselves than to cause someone else to be unhappy. I have actually started to curb this tendency in myself and have gotten much better at being straight with people than I used to be. Time was that when I wanted to get out of a relationship I would engineer a situation where the relationship was unworkable.. Horrible way to behave? No question about it, but I was too immature to find a better way to deal with it.. Now I am in a situation where I am much better at saying that I have a problem with a relationship, but still find it difficult to explain what the problems are.. It's also much more difficult being honest about things like this than it is to be a prick and just let the relationship slowly die a death.. How can you convey to someone that things have changed and it isn't something you can change back without that fact hurting them? I think I also have wierd issues with knowing things are going bad and just not wanting to wait for it to get to the stage where they are really bad.. It's all a bit wierd really and I am straying WAY off topic.. Hmmm Then end of the conversation was basically me and my dad are very similar but I think I have managed to get to a point my Dad hasn't achieved yet where I amn't willing to continue making the same mistakes\problems that I have in the past...  Back to the rest of the day..  After that conversation with pops I got into the Capitol and by this stage my Tuna episode from the day before (remember that?) had returned to haunt me.. And how. I had gone into town for Janets B-Day drinks and spent 4 hours of discomfort watching other people drink while the only thing I could stomach was bloody water.. Grrrrrrr. Then I was half way home in the pissing rain when I realised that Bubbles had my keys and I had to go to his place first.. By the time I get there I am soaked TO THE BONE.. I cannot impress upon you just how wet I was.. Think swimming with your clothes on and you are still thinking too dry.. Spent a couple of hours drying off in bubbles place before crawling home dazed, confused and exhausted. It was a BAD BAD DAY from about 4PM on..  Monday was quiet.. Went into town to watch X-Men and ended up meeting Helena. Went for Food and Coffee and chatting and then she came to see X-Men with me..  I still find it difficult when I am with Helena.. I still feel strongly for her in both a physical and emotional way at the moment so it is very hard to keep things on a friendship level. Especially difficult when you spend enough time together that you start to feel comfortable again.. I still have this Helena shaped hole in my life, but it's not something that I can easily fill\fix..  Wow.. what started out as a simple short blog has turned into a monster.. It's also strange feeling to blog regardless of the consequences.. Hoping I haven't pissed anyone off.. Nothing said here is meant in a hurtfull way but conveying the emotion behind a sentence is very difficult to do.. I'm in a strange mood this week and it's just all coming out of me today.. Consider this my way of "clearing out my closet".  Anyway, I may blog more later.  Mike

      The plan was to go learn from the salsa master himself by getting as physically close as possible while he danced and seeing if anything rubbed off.. Unfortunately that plan has changed but there is an upside!  The plan as it stands now is to go to the great ones abode and take the red pill one more time before I go see the new movie tomorrow! Wish me luck.

To be honest I can't remember the reading that well at all but one thing that sticks out in my mind is that I came away with a distinct impresion\memory of my hopes\fears which all relate pretty much directly to my feelings\emotions regarding relationships.. (wow, I just noticed how many times I used the '\' key in that sentence.. Freaky or what..)  Anyway, my big thing is a fear of relationships in general but at the same time a fear that I am going to end up alone.. I never really have trouble meeting people but I always end up alone again (or as alone as I ever get) and I am begining to think that I have a personality that will (in the long run) end up alone because I will never settle.. It could have something to do with my past and a deep rooted feeling that relationships can never work out.. I don't conciously feel that way but I think maybe deep down that is why I keep ending up alone..  The other thing that was interesting was that in my past was the king of swords.. That is basically a whole lotta pain.. I think Gordon was a bit surprised at that card and it made me realise that a lot of people I have in my life at the moment have only nkown me for a few months, there is probably only about 4-5 people who have known me long enough\well enough to know a lot of my "story".. It's interesting to see how people see me now compared to what people would have seena few years ago (I am a COMPLETELY different person now..)  Anyway, I'm giong to stop this surreal blog before it goes any further.. Grr arrghh and stuff.

      Just a quick blog before I head to trim for the morning (Don't ask)  I am uploading a "test" site to the  urlLink afterhours.ie  site and I was hoping I could get people to play around with it a bit.. It is a portal engine I am toying with using as the basis for the new site but it has most of the functions I want in the site already built in. If ppl could read the news posting on the first page it has a list of things I need looked at and there is a poll on the homepage\forum where you can add comments to let me know what you think..  Check out  urlLink afterhours.ie , you know you want to :)

      Lots going on.. Had a quiet weekend where I slept through most of it.. Unfortunately my Gran is very sick so I am hoping to get out to the hospital to see her this week.. My sisters have gone to somewhere sunny for the week (lucky bitches) and I am feelin' a little bit lost at the moment..  The very idea of relationships aer still very confusing for me at the moment.. Don't really know what I want or how to figure out what I want or anything even vaguely like that.. (I know that sentence makes no sense but the whole thing makes no sense if you ask me..)  hmmm.. I'm just going to wander off in this direction now.

      K, just a quick blog..  Don't really know what to say to be honest.. Don't feel like waffling on about the site and stuff but don't feel quite ready for the emotional purge I feel coming on..  I was talking to Jonny last night and I said to him that I realised for the first time in about 6-7 years I actaully feel unhappy. Not just upset by something for a brief period or depressed for a day or two but geniunely unhappy. This may sound wierd but I REALLY amn't used to that.. I usually feel pretty damn good.. I keep things seperate as in when I am in work my personal life isn't an issue and when I am at home I don't let work stress me because there is nothing I can do about it till tomorrow.. But recently I have just had a general unhappiness that is alien to me..  Ah well, I'll just have to go home and get drunk :) Actually, that has never really helped me but I'm sure I can give it the old college try. Have decided not to head to salsa tonight, gonna try to go Sunday instead..  K still waffling.. gonna go now.

      OK, I have had an interesting few days and I have to say they have been pretty damn good.  I am in a great mood again, I think I am actually back up to my old form, which is great because being down has not been a pleasent experience for me.. It's not something I am used to and I don't like it damn it.  Anyway.. My life.. I have to say the conversation I had with Bubbs put me in a great mood for Tuesday. It had been a bit "old times"-ish and had reminded me what makes me me.. Childish idiocy and bizarre conversations that really are TRUELY wrong to begin with. It had been ages since I had spoken about all kindsa random things that people don't normally talk about, a situation I fixed on Tuesday night with two different conversations that were great.. One was a guy that walked into a conversation me and tamara and alison were having about Testicles.. Poor guy was as red as a fully loaded beetroot. The other was a long conversation I had taking in everything from my quest to get the hair on my scrotum permenantly removed and my knob getting it's superfluous skin removed to being asked if I wanna "go fuck little boy" when I was 13. Admitedly the girl I was atlking about all this with was more than able to handle the conversation and gave as good as she got which was even more fun :)  And that has carried me through to today. Yesterday was a calm enough day till Gordon came over and we had a great conversation about all kinds of everything (remind me of you...) and I wibbled on about all kinds of stuff. T'was great..  Although apparently the day got much better after I went to sleep. I woke up to find soot marks all over my bathroom sink and the burnt and twisted remains of a BRA on my kitchen sink.. I let that go for the moment and went to work only to find out in a recap of the night before from bubbles that Janet had decided to burn her bra in our sink and then Jonny, Janet and Bubbles played strip poker (not sorry I missed that because Bubbles lost.. I see enough of him as it is). Then after bubbles went to Bub, Jonny and Janet left the flat wearing shoes and socks only. Apparently all they did was "walk down the road and headed into the alley".. That doesn't sound dodgy at ALL  Ho Hum..  Anyway, the point of my blog is to tell the world Life is good :)

      Had the weirdest conversation with Bubbles last night.. The end result of which was I have decided that one of my testicles is larger than the other (or one of my hands is larger than the other) and that you can feel your testicles moving on their own if you pay attention to it.. (For any Gurls reading this, a guys testicles slowly move all on their own when left to their own devices.. It can be fun to just sit and watch the little fellas doing their little dance all on their own) Actually that was quite funny..  Mike:"I wonder if you can feel your testicles moving on their own without touching them"  Bubbles:"I Dunno"  Mike and Bubbs in Unison: "Yep, you can"  Queue the Smile and Girlish Titter.  We also had quite a discussion on dressing to the left\right and the situations that can occur "When cocks go hard" (Tonight on Sky One as part of Tuesday nights reality night) There is nothing weirder than sitting down in Salsa and someone comes to ask and as you go to stand up you realize the old tackle has decided it's time to make an example of you again and whats worst is it somehow managed to trap itself down your left trouser leg.. I don't know if girls have ever noticed but when the ole' buy gets stuck in a position like that it's EXTREMELY obvious that something is fighting to make it back to the nice safe confines of being "dressed to the right"  Which reminds me, I have officially named Tuesday as random hard on day.. We were also discussing the "random erection". When you turn around and for no apparent reason your second favourite shower companion has decided to go into action without you..  Bubbles: You know the way you get an errection for no apparent reason, it's just there.  Mike: Yeah, Like on a Tuesday  So henceforth Tuesday is boner day :)  Wow.. Now that I think of it, we were like a couple of school girls at a slumber party. Sick

      I just thought I would point out again while I am on the subject of my nether regions (again) I DO still have an oral sex donations link to the left that has been SERIOUSLY neglected by the readers of this blog..  Please? If I have to resort to sticking a link on my blog begging for it..  Actually, tell you what! For every act of fellatio donated I will promise 2 (YES! TWO!) acts of cunnilingus to the donor!

      I am Michaels jealous nut-sack.  Every 3 days or so Mike takes me out and puts me through the same routine. No matter how much abuse he has put me through recently (and usually he puts me through a fair old amount of abuse.. I thought Bubbles moving in would give me a break but NO! Somehow he still manages to find the time and the place to put me through my paces) he takes me out, smothers me with shaving foam and proceeds to strip all the hair I've recently grown to keep myself warm and also strip away what little moisture I have managed to build up...  Over all this hasn't really been an issue until recently, last night to be exact. I've never really enjoyed the twice - three times weekly scrape-athon but I persevere because, well, to be honest everything feels so much nicer without it..   But then last night Jonny came home drunk..  Now I know this is no great surprise.. I'd be surprised if he came home sober at this stage.. But for a change Jonny took it into his head to display his cock and balls to the room.   Not once but several times..   Anyway, that bastards nutsack is smooth as a babys bottom! Not a hair to be seen! Admitedly there was some hair up north, but not even that bastard Michael has started shaving that far north!  So that has made me Michaels jealous nutsack.. And what's worse is that Michaels shaft (lives just above me, nice guy but very cocky) has spent the day smug as can be.  Bastard.

      Hmm.. I kinda want to blog but kinda don't today..  Last night was ok, but I was very tired. By twelve I just wanted to go home but it was little sisters birthday so couldn't really go anywhere.. Was good fun hanging out with her but OMG was I tired.. Think Sat night took it out of me to be honest.  Things are strange for me at the moment.. I trying to sort out my head about a few different things. It's strange because I am still in a good mood but I have to make some pretty serious decisions very soon or risk ending up annoying people\hurting people.  All very cryptic I know.. Sorry but I can't really say more cause I don't know quite how to phrase it but hey, I'm sure you will all think it involves people it doesn't in situations it doesn't and I'll have fun cleaning the mess up.  I love stress.

I don't think she can handle seeing me talking about the benefits of circumcission on the internet for all to see :)  She's sitting beside me as I write this.. Uncomfortable mum?  "yes" Hehehe  I loves my mummy, she rocks :)

      Chelonia gave me a list of questions for a big emotional blog, so here goes ;)  1. How would your ideal life differ from the one you lead right now?  It wouldn't. I love my life and wouldn't change a thing  2. Whats one thing you really regret?  I don't think there is anything I REALLY regret. I have made mistakes but they have made me the person I am today and as I said above, I wouldn't change a thing..  3. Who's someone that you don't express your general appreciation for enough?  Jonny.  4. Do you believe in a) God b) humanity c) yourself  Yes Yes Yes  5. Where's Waldo?  He's hiding from me because he owes me 50  6. What was your happiest moment ever?  The day my dad told me he was proud of me and that he loved me  7. How does a guy with such a great Hot Or Not photo end up lying alone in bed wishing for sex?  To be honest I don't.. If I want sex it isn't really that much of a problem. It's the emotional relationships that are a problem..  8. What one-hit wonder group from the 80s would you ressurect?  Wax  9. What's your favorite smell?  Eh.. hehe, I know this is rude but, well, pussy. I love the smell..  10. Where would you like to be right now?  In bed but who wouldn't :)  Sorry, I know those are all terribly optimistic answers but my life is really that good..

      I'm in a weird mood recently (As you may have noticed)  I want to write a huge emotional blog. The kind of one that reminds you of words like purge and exfoliate. (ok, maybe that's a bad description)  The thing is I don't know what it is I want to write. I have this splurge waiting to come but no idea what's in it.. Dangerous eh?? Any day now I'm going to splurge all over one of you (in a non sexual way of course, unless it's gordy) and you won't know what hit you :)  I have to say, sometimes Josh can really get up my nose.. (No, I amn't going to give you any details)  Hmm, back to work I think.

So far I am up to 4 (I know, I'm pretty disapointed so far myself.. Maybe I'm thinking about it too much)   Also looking forward to Salsa today :) I wants to gets my dance on :)   Gordon is back in the country! Wh0ot! Missed you big guy..   Ehm.. Grass is Green.   OK, Sorry, random thoughts spewing from my mind onto the keyboard, not very focused, good mood making strange blogs etc.   Stopping now,   Really I am.   STOP.   hehehe

      Oh yeah, Thanks for reminding me bubbs.  Foreskin.. We were watching tv last night and there was a double episode of this comedy thing on Net 2 that I quite like. We've caught it twice in the early hours of the morning and it's fun.. Anyway, they all found out that one of the guys still sported a turtle neck and everyone went on about how ugly it was. Of course I proceeded to go on about Bubbles Ugly Cock.  (Just to let you know, if you still have your foreskin I think you have an ugly cock and nothing you say can convince me otherwise. I've seen mine before and after and I know what I'd prefer if I was a woooman.)  Anyway what do our lady viewers think?  With or without?

      What to write.. What to write, what to write, what to write..  So, Myself and bubbles are lying in bed (I just want to make this clear from the outset so there are no mistakes.. He was in HIS bed I was in MY bed. Two beds one room, NO lights. Ok Kiddies?) and I says to him. I says, "I want to have sex"  I don't know why I said it, I think I was just thinking it and decided what the hell lets share.. There's a pause while what I said sinks into our respective heads and suddenly we both double over laughing. It was hillarious. This one tiny comment and the two of us run through all the various possible responses in our head and just start to laugh. I was laughing so hard I was in tears..  This seems to be a regular theme recently. We go to bed at like 2AM watch TV for an hour or two and then start to talk about the weirdest stuff.  My Weekend? It was great actually. Really great. I spent Friday night in cleaning with Bubbles till about 1AM when I got a call from a friend who was having drinks at home and invited me over (you know me and drink.. I was there in no time flat :))  It was good to finaly get some time to chat 'cause it was someone I've known for a while but hadn't really had a chance to get to know them properly till this weekend. Very enlightening..  Then on Saturday I just relaxed and lazed for the day day. I entered a kind of comatose state of oblivion. I wasn't asleep but I wasn't awake. Surprisingly restfull.. Then I went to a comedy club thing in the IFC that was quite good. The MC was basically reading material I had already seen in E-mail jokes which was dissapointing and the second warm up guy just didn't have the stage presence but the other two warm up guys and the main guy were brilliant. Great value too, I recommend the night to all.  Rest of the night was quiet (it finished at 1AM) and I went straight home to bed and sleep which was really nice.. Haven't done that in a while and it felt really good.  Then Sunday was a brilliant day as well. Had a lovely morning, woke up really nicely and got up about twelve, had a really nice breakfast. Sausages, rashers, scrambled eggs (with real vegetable in them!!) and some toast and juice. T'was great, chilled and listened to music and stuff for a while, then went over to my mums and managed (after a quick trip to the hardware store) to fix her washing machine for a total cost of 6 Euros (there's value) and then spent the rest of the afternoon evening giving her all the gossip (I tell my mum WAY too much about me..)  Then home to watch tv and relax. Overall it sounds quiet but it was great.. Best weekend I've had in a while :)

      What to write.. What to write.. What to write..  Hmmmm  Well, life has been ok recently. Few ups. Few Downs.. Over all more ups than downs which has to be good really..  Last night was unbelievably good fun. Went to see Bruce Allmighty and then into the Garda Club for some Thaltha (Before anyone says anything it was after classes were over so I had a choice of paying into Bojangles or free in Garda Club..) which was great fun! (Just sorry big G wasn't there..)  Alvin can lapdance like a squirel chasing a nut down a hill or some other vermin related comparison. Orla as always was a rockin dancer and D ROCKS! She lead me (on the floor too damnit!) and it was... bizarre? no.. freaky.. yes but not strong enough.. enough to make me want to shit my pants and always beg a woman for forgiveness before I dance with her? NOW we're getting there..  I must say though she has some funky moves.. She should me two really small but VERY neat little tricks recently.. Yummy.  Anywho, posting this blog mainly because I will be away next week till Thursday (finally going to see my baby bro!) so thought I had better give you something to play with for a few days..  Hmmmm.. That's pretty much all my news..

      OK. This is beginning to piss me off..  Why is it that people think that just because they talk to me every now and again and maybe they have gone out for a drink with me on occasion they think that they know me?  I have situations in my life when people THINK they know me better than I know myself, when infact they don't actually know anything about me..  True Story: I was going out with this Girl. I was in love and was very happy. One night I am out with a mutual friend of ours in RiRa. we are sitting upstairs having a chat when this DROP DEAD blonde from the Netherlands comes up to me and says "Hi, What's your name?" I introduce myself and say hi, she then asks me straight out have I got a girlfriend.. I'm a bit surprised but I say yeah I do and she says "That's a pity, I'd love to go downstairs and fuck you in the toilets." My friends jaw drops, he is sitting behind her and he starts frantically signalling to me to go. He very clearly lets me know that there is no way my GF will ever find out from him and that it's ok, he understands. What he doesn't realise is that I really REALLY don't want to be unfaithful to this girl because she means that much to me. Hell yeah it was tempting, who wouldn't have been tempted but I left it. Three more times she came over to me that night and every time I said no..  So said, when I am single?  True Story: I was seeing this girl. Had been out with her a few times but it was nothing serious. Met up with her and we went to Ri-Ra. What's the first thing I see walking in the door? another girl I am seeing.. You see my dilemma.. I go over, kiss the other girl on the cheek, ask her were she is sitting and when I find out she is upstairs I tell her I'm here with friends and I'll be in to her in a minute. Go downstairs and position Bubbles with the girl downstairs, bring Jonny upstairs and leave him with the other girl and I proceed to bounce between the two all night.. I know that is pretty bold to say the least but I wasn't in a relationship with either of them and they knew it. I just didn't want to rub the fact I was seeing someone else in their faces.. The really funny part of this story (hmmm.. Funny is the wrong word but I haven't found the right word yet) is that I actually left that night with a third girl who turned into my Italian stalker (yes I have had a stalker.. cool eh?)  There we go. Two true stories from my life that sound like two completely different people. What do we learn about me from this? I have no fucking clue.. The point I am trying to get across is that while I can be a complete slut it is only when I have every right to be. When I am committed to someone. REALLY committed then I am completely faithful and honest with that person. Anyone I have gone out with knows every one of my dirty secrets and stories. They know I have been in threesomes and mini orgies, they know I have gone out with twins one after the other. They know I have stolen my best friends girlfriend only to realise it was the fact that she was the worst person for me to go out with that attracted me to her. They all know this about me and know that I will never betray them because the upside of my behaviour in the past is that I have learned from my mistakes.  Another Example: Elvis\Richard I dont even know where to begin.. I still have a nice little pit of anger in my stomach and believe me it takes a LOT to make me angry. You have to really work hard to get me worked up.. I think the thing that pissed me off the most about what he said was when he said that if I have a problem with him I should have brought it to him privately.. I had no problem with him at all yet he decides to ignore his own advice and try to trap me online. Again this is hilarious because the actions themselves dont bother me at all.. What bothers me is his reason for them. That and him bringing my private annoyance at what was going on in Salsa into the public domain.  Which reminds me. WHO THE FUCK TOLD ELVIS ABOUT MY PRIVATE LIFE? I WILL FUCKING TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF AND SHIT DOWN YOUR NECK TILL YOU SUFFOCATE!  Actually I wont but please please please, never talk about my private life to someone who you dont know for a fact I would talk to myself. My private life is my own and while I have no secrets from my friends I have no wish to have my secrets told to people I dont know can keep them. Basic rule is if its not on my blog I dont want it told..  Im still mad and I want to rant more but I think Ill leave it.. Already up to two pages in word..  Grrrr

      LOL. A clasic quote from the Archives:   urlLink Midgets Rock : "Hehe, It's 10AM, do you know where your children are?  If they are anything like Bubbles they probably just abandoned their mate for a swedish chick that they won't get any from ;)  (Yes, it would be different if he had got some.. THEN I'd understand ;)"

      OMG Bubbles just pointed out to me how long I have been blogging! It's OVER a year.. It has just flown by.. I went back just now and read my very first post and I have to say it really is a surprise that I still update it at all.. I usually get distracted and wander off much sooner..   Here is my very first blog : urlLink Midgets Rock : "Welcome to my Blog.. As with most things I will probably post rampantly to this thing for the next month then completely forget that I have it ;)   By the way, most of my posts will be done through a haze of alcohol.. please feel free to ignore everything I say.."

      Well.. Just a quicky to say I've juggled the blog listings again.. FoXXy has decided to finish her blog. Dutchgold was long over due going to the shamed box. Ash has finaly blogged again and that's about it really..  Birthday plans are a bit fupped.. Have to change from Sin to somewhere else (at the moment Capitol is looking most likely because I can't be bothered going very far from RiRa..)  Might blog more later.. Might not.. What you gonna do about it eh?

      For Birthday news go to the bottom of the blog, wanna ramble a bit first ;)  OK. Have been a few days without blogging and I am in a much better "space" right now :)  Have calmed down a lot about a few things that have pissed me off and I have decided some people aren't really worth getting stressed about.  I have discovered recently that some of my friends I have trusted too much and given more respect than they are due.. My friendship is something that is given freely and I will go out of my way for anyone, then I wait and see how the friendship develops. Sometimes the friendship develops wonderfully and I end up with friends I truely respect and would do anything for (Gordon is a good example of this.. In a short space of time I have come to have great respect\admiration\time for the big G). Sometimes, I don't...  Sometimes I get "friends" who have only one thing that is really important in their lives and that's them.. I don't really have the time\energy\desire to have friends that are only skin deep. I still spend time with them but in my own mind they are acquaintances that I will of course go out of my way to help and all the rest but you know it's something that you do in the knowledge that when the time comes and you need them there is a good chance they won't be there..  The other thing I spoke about in my last blogs was the people who think they know me.. There have been a ton of people over the years who think they know me and never really discover otherwise.. Hell I think sometimes even my closest friends don't really get certain areas of my life.. (At least with them they try and I do appreciate that..) There's been a few times in the last few months that two of my closest friends have really surprised me with things that they have said to me.. I just thought in my head "Wow.. I thought he knew me better than that.." when it happened.. Maybe I am too secretive with the stuff that really makes me what I am.. I know that sounds strange.. I talk on my blog about being sexually abused when I was younger, shaving my testicles, my history with girls and sometimes some pretty heavy details about what is going on in my life at the moment but the thing is that none of that is what I am or makes me who I am.. They are all things taht have happened or I choose to do but none of that defines who I am or represents what I think about things..  I have moments in my life that were special and I keep close to my heart and none of that really makes it here.. It's the kind of thing that only the people who get close to me ever hear and even then I can count the people that I have ever included in that group on one hand. I'm vaguely extroverted and I think too many people mistake my "public" face as being who I actually am.. When in fact nothing could be further from the truth..  An example would be my self confidence.. I have BUCKETS of self-confidence when it comes to certain things. I KNOW I am great at my Job. I know I will ALWAYS have a job if I want one. There are loads of areas and situations I feel confident in\about but when it comes down to it I actually have huge problems with my view of myself.. Hot or not was a real surprise for me because I truely thought I was an ugly guy.. I still think I am un-atractive and that the picture must just be a good pic that has some wierd lighting shit going on.. I figured being able to dance and having a strong air of self-confidence was why I managed to meet girls and my "winning personality" got me from there ;) Now I have a 9.3 to 9.4 sitting under my pic and I still can't comprehend it.. It just doesn't fit in my head at all.. (Or Karls ;]) And there are other areas of my life where my confidence is "strange" but I won't go into all that here ;)  Hmm.. What a strange blog this is turning into.. Anyway.. I'm gonna stop boring you all and get straight to the good stuff..  This Friday at 8PM we are all meeting in SIN in Temple Bar for drinkin' dancin' and celebrating another year on the planet for myself.. One and all are invited and they can all bring a friend :) The only requirement is that you come in a god damn good mood and ready to party :)  See you then :)

      Hmmmm.. Don't really have the time or energy to blog today..  I'm in the middle of a work related.. Crisis isn't the right word but definitely stressed.. I don't want to go into too much detail here and now but basically I have had to rethink the way everything is done and completely re-structure the company from the top down. Over all this is probably a good thing and it has shaken so good things out..  Also seems to have been a change in luck.. Yesterday I talked to a customer who is just waiting to get out of his existing contract so he can sign with us (and it will be our biggest customer yet) and a company who I had been told had signed a deal with someone else called me this morning and asked me to send out the quote again because their funding was approved and they hadn't signed with anyone.. I think there is a fair chance of getting it, which would be really cool..  Hmm.. I think I may be rambling a bit. The problem is my head is running away with me thanks to all the different things that are floating through it at the moment.. I have so much to think and keep track of that it's all kinda overwhelming. Every time I try to focus on one thing seven others crowd in and push it aside..  Anywho, I plan on relaxing for the weekend and hopefully not working too much (dunno how much hope but we'll see) so hope you all have a good one too :)  Mike (Kinda)

      My anual "It's my birthday so I won't be able to blog for a week" is pretty much over now so here's the blog you've all been waiting for..  First off my Birthday was absolutely amazing! I REALLY REALLY want to thank everyone who showed up.. I was completely blown away by how many of you all showed up.. We completely took over a huge section of the capitol! I really appreciated it and it meant a lot to me that so many people showed up..  I got to capitol and started drinking early.. Myself and Jonny got to catch up nicely :) Then all the others started to filter in.. It was great we started with one table and then slowly expanded :)  Had a load of drinks poured into me (including a green cocktail that I am afraid I can't remember who got it for me.. whoever you are thank you.. it's actually one of my clearer memories.. I remember trying to find my green glass over and over :)) and wandered around chatting to one and all.. [Insert a large Blank here] Then myself and Bubbles started to dance.. That was.. Interesting.. I remember about 60-70% of dancing with bubbles but one thing I clearly remember is suddenly noticing that * Everyone * has stopped drinking and is looking at us.. Not just my friends but everyone in capitol seemed to have stopped to watch..  This leads me to a strange quandry.. Every time I get really drunk around bubbles and there is hip hop we usually end up dancing and nine out of ten times we get a similar reaction.. I have yet to firmly convince myself that they aren't laughing when they look at me :) (Shup Fewl.. I won't take no shit from you..)  Anyway. After that I remember subjecting poor claire to some drunken salsa.. Sorry Claire.. Please forgive me.. The next little while is another blank.. Then we are on the move to RiRa! Wohoo! At this stage I am very... Hazy on what happens next.. I remember getting to RiRa. I remember going directly to the Table Football and myself and Gordon playing against two pricks.. When we started I was just playing as always but then they pissed me off and as a few people can tell you I am good enough at Table Football that no matter how drunk I am you piss me off and you might as well leave the table now.. We kicked seven shades of sugar out of them, then fired up by alcohol and anger I  demanded  they let me play them one on two where again I trounced them completely.  I loved every minute of it..  My next memory is of dancing with Orla somewhere in RiRa and considering how well I know RiRa it is scary that I can't picture where.. And that is pretty much it till I am leaving.. I have heard reports of myself Jon and Bubbles going at it on the dance floor again. Myself Orla and Jenny having a bob and something about disarming a nuclear weapon with my teeth.. I think that last report wat put there just to fuck with me..  Anyone has anything else they can remember\report PLEASE let me know...   Saturday I woke up surprisingly alive.. I think.. I was still a bit drunk in all honesty. Spent Most of Saturday laxing around Orlas while she was at a run through for a choir gig they were singing that night.. then up to mumy dearests for a little while in the evening before going to The Gig.  Myself and mum went to Orlas "A Summer nights Gospel with the Dublin Gospel Choir" (Yeah, I thought the name was funny too, just don't tell Orla I said that...) I have to say I had an amazing night.. The opening act where a group called Apes & Babes. They were an acapelo choir that sung songs with no band, yet still sounded like a full band was playing..The did everything from folks songs to "No Limits" and a prodigy track that just rocked.. Very fuppin cool.  GAH! I hate when you get a malteser that's rotten in the middle.. And back to my blog..  Then the Gospel Choir came on and OMG.. It was brilliant (even if they did keep getting us to stand up! Down with that sort of thing! I had a sore leg...) The singers were all amazing, really REALLY good. I had never really heard Orla singing properly before, apparently she only sings properly when she's getting paid.. Bloody Diva.. The rest of the night was just cool... Never thought a night of gospel could be so much fun.. Anyway.. After the show there was an "after show party" at one of the choirs members houses (Sue.. Funky Funky lady :)) and Apes and Babes showed up. After a few drinks and a bit to eat they all started signing and OMG.. There were about 4 people in the room and we all just huddled in the corner thinking about how we would never try to sing in public again.. Have to say overall.. An excellent night was had..  Sunday day was brilliant... It was a complete write off. I did NOTHING at all. It rocked. Then in the evening myself and Orla headed to the Ormonde Quay for a quick dance before going to the fund raiser thing in the Morrison. When we get there the place looks dead.. No Table set up with Kelly Anne sitting there looking into the middle distance.. No Salsa videos on display.. No sound at all.. We go around to the Back room and have a look for a class there.. Nothing.. The place is dead.. So we go to head down to the ormonde and phone Gordon to ask him what's going on.. Turns out the class was on with the door closed and no table set up outside.. Oh well..  Couldn't reallt dance 'cause my legs were still killing me from dancing on Friday night (Oh yeah.. When I drink and dance the dance gets a bit.. Mad.. It usually hurts for days..) but had a nice time watching and then the same in the morrison... (Sarah and T really should have won the raffle.. I think it was a fix..)  Then Monday I took off again.. (I know.. What a weekend eh?) Had another lovely day of doing next to nothing. Then we went over to my mums for the anual birthday tea! I love going to my mums on my B-day.. It's so nice.. And then just stayed in watching a video and drinking wine.. All in all the perfect weekend :)  Thanks to everyone who made it so funky\special :)  Mike (Now a whole year older..)

      OK. I am in a better frame of mind today. I think I am slowly managing to come to grips with my work stuff and I am having to just get on with my personal stuff so things can't really afford to be anything other than good.  Actually I am in a good mood now. Had a great time last night and am in a general all round good mood now.. Lets see how long it lasts..  I suppose I had better let you all in on some of what has been happening.  The big thing is that Karl has left the company. That's a good thing for Karl and an OK thing for me so far but it was done in quite a bit of a hurry and wasn't thought out properly which left me with a LOT of mess to clean up.. Hence the stress and the like..  On the up side it will mean that by the end of the month costs will have roughly halfed and the sole stock holder will be me.. Who says there is never a silver lining?  K, I got to get back to work (again) The big downside at the moment is that no matter how much I do I still have 25 things left on the list.. It should only take me a week or two to get it all sorted out but for the moment work is REALLY work..

      Crap Crap Crap Crap Crap Crap Crap.  My Days just keep getting worse at the moment. If it isn't one thing it's another..  Work life: Crap  Personal Life: Great if it wasn't for the worlds constant attempts to kick me in the teeth  Work wise things are all over the place at the moment.. In some ways things are going great in others though everything is completely up in the air. I am in a serious state of flux with no answers coming to me at all.. Grr and Arrghh that I', in this god damn situation.  Personally just when things seem to be coming together and I am in a good place something happens to remind me that someone somewhere REALLY doesn't like me.. I just can't seem to catch a break..  All of this stuff has finally managed to drain my energy reserves.. I have this store of energy that I use to keep me in a good place no matter what is going on but sometimes so many things all go wrong at the same time and I am left completely drained and emotionally void. This is my cold place and happens to be where I am currently living..  On the bright side I got Orla to wax my chest which was incredibly painful and this cream stuff I put on afterwards combined with the sweat of a night in Coyote caused me to come up in a load of painful blotches that are only just starting to fade properly now.. Yes that is my bright side :)  Actually it was very funny.. Orla took a great deal of perverse pleasure in ripping wads of hair from my chest and I have learnt that I have VERY strong hair follicles..  Hair removal is not all it's cracked up to be..

      I never knew this existed as a word but just got this in my word of the day e-mail:     physiognomy \fiz-ee-OG-nuh-mee; -ON-uh-mee\, noun:    1. The art of discovering temperament and other characteristic    qualities  of the mind from the outward appearance, especially    by the features of the face.    2.  The  face  or facial features, especially when regarded as    indicating character.    3. The general appearance or aspect of a thing.  I've been doing physiognomy for years without even knowing it.. Know I just need to practice pronouncing it..

      Writen last night:  Well.. I thought I would make use of the fact I have a laptop and actually write something for a change..  The only thing now is what to write.. There's so much to say yet so much I can't say anymore.. My Blog has slowly evolved from somewhere I could write whatever I want to somewhere that I have to watch what I say more than I do in real life..  It's strange how much intonation and facial expresion adds to a conversation.. I say fuck you on a blog and ten people will hear it ten different ways.. I say it with a smile and Bubbles in a head lock and everyone knows I'm telling him how much I hate that son of a Bitch.  I have re-written this paragraph (yes the one you are reading now) 5 times. I've realised there is just no way to write what I want to write so I have to leave it.. That leaves me feeling (I've now been sat here for the last 5 minutes trying to figure out the next word.. What a blog this is..) cheated? That isn't the right word but it is the best one I can find right now..  Hmmmm.. What a depressing blog this is turning out to be and again that's just because it is text with no feeling or emoting to give it the right context.. It's not like a book because I can hardly write in a third person style (or maybe I could..)  "Michael sat down to write his blog. As he opened notepad thoughts of what to write flowed through his mind, random memories of his last couple of days.  Would he write about work or play? He is in a good mood, work is going well and his love life (though complex at best) gives him a smile he can't resist beaming to the world at every oportunity. As he starts to type a thread starts to form in his mind. Whenever Michael blogs it's always the same.. He starts out with a sentance and occasionaly a rough map of where he wants his blog to end up but never lets anything reach a solid state till it is coming from his mind straight to the keyboard.. This has gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion, and it is this that he decides to use as his 'subject matter'.  He smiles to himself as he types away warming to his subject matter when suddenly he hits a stumbling block. How does he talk about his newfound tendency to censor his own blogs without getting into the shadier subject of exactly what he is leaving out..."  Hmm.. Again I hit a stumbling block.. How to phrase what comes next?  I guess the answer is I can't.. Not yet anyway.. So what do I do?  "Michael smiles to himself in a genuinely good mood as he realises that it doesn't really matter what he writes. The familiar damned if you do, damned if you don't feeling that he has come to welcome as the spice that keeps his life interesting settles on him as he realises that he has already writen enough to get himself in trouble  for a few more days without actually having said a thing..."

I am in a freezing server room with my jumper on using my notepad to warm my legs..  Hmm.. Hopefully I will have something interesting to say later 'cause right now I'm stumped..

      GAH!!! What a day. First off I don't get proper instructions for a Job I woke up at 8 in the morning for, then I have huge problems getting a 80 gig file copy going (yes I am watching 80 gigs copy and paste today)  Now to top if off a package that was meant to be delivered last week by fedex had a bloody wrong address. I send bubbles out (in a TAXI to Santry no less) to get it delivered to the right address because they can't do a change of address till tonight and after he arrives (he checked on the phone first to make sure he could get it today) they tell him it is probably in the van and won't be here to 5.30 tonight.. This is WAY after when I need to get it to my customer..  GAH!!!!!!!  Why does the world hate me so today? EH EH EH?

      Hmmmm.. I don't really know what to write today..  Bit hung over after last night (Myself and Orla went to a pub in Rathfarnham to catch up with some friends of hers.. I didn't have much to drink but it was so close yesterday I think I was a bit De-Hydrated) so my blog will probably be incoherent at best..  Things are going exceptionally well for me recently. I'm feeling content in my life, not something I am used to. I've already blogged about how well work has been going recently (although it is getting very close to the end of the month damn it..) so I'm going to navigate the dodgy waters that is blogging about my relationships..  I'm moving in with Orla next month some time and I couldn't be happier about it.. Things are going better than I would have ever expected. When I first started seeing Orla I wasn't looking for a relationship really.. I had thought I'd had my fill of relationships for the moment and I think Orla was in the same position.  So what happened? I honestly can't tell you. I still don't quite understand what has happened.. I just know that I am happy in a way that is different to anything I have experienced in a long time.. I've always kept a part of myself locked away, a safe point to retreat to and keep a type of control over my emotions..  Anyone that knows me well knows that I have a way of shutting myself off when I feel too emotional or vulnerable. This has always been my safety switch.. I don't like losing control of myself and never really let myself be ruled by my emotions.. But all that is changing now..  Does that mean everything else I ever felt wasn't real or true? No. The best I can explain it (given that I still don't really understand it) is that this "fits" me.. So far there have been matchs that were so close to being right, but they were just not right. It didn't "fit" properly.  Anyway.. The point of my blog (This blog is something I have wanted to write for a while) is to say I'm happy and things are good.. I'm happy in work and love and can't wait to see where my life is going to take me next..  Heh.

      Just as a side note to my previous blog.. I got as far as and here's my spout and the next two lines were a complete blank.. I phoned my mum and my sister, neither of them knew. I asked the one person that was sure to know all the lyrics to every cute nursery rhyme in the world (Bubbles) and he was at a loss too (although he did come closest.. See I amn't mad, he does know his nursery rhymes!!) and eventually I searched the web in an attempt to finish my blog.  I finally found the missing lines and clicked on post and publish on my blog, and at the moment my computer goes TEA TIME! TEA TIME! TEA TIME!  For 30 seconds I was both shocked and surprised because at first site it looked like the blog engine had recognised the poem and decided to poke fun at me.. Then I realised that a page with the words for the poem had just finished loading an embeded sound file..  Oh well..

      so...  Anyway..  Hmmmm...  OK.. Things are both good and bad at the moment.. I have good things work wise going on that if they all come together things will be sitting pretty for a few more months..  On the flip side I have some bad things that I need to sort out too.. Not bad, just confusing.. I need to get a car to deal with a lot of things work wise but I am damned if I can figure out the best way to sort it all out..   Anywho..

      OK.. I am again Surprised by my word of the day e-mail from dictionary.com.. This thing rocks..  There is a word that literaly means "To throw out of a window." One word to describe the exact action of throwing someone out of a window.. Not a Door, or off a balcony, out of a window ONLY.. Not only that but you would NEVER guess what it means from the word..  If anything I think I would prbably of hazarded a guess at "to put yourself into a defensive position" or some such..  Wanna know what the word is?  "Defenestrate"  That word means "To throw out of a window"  Freaky..  Here are some examples of the usage (again taken from the e-mail)  "    Some  of  his  apparent  chums . . . would still happily      defenestrate him if they caught him near a window.      --Andrew   Marr,   "No   option   bar   the  radical  one,"      [1]Independent, July 5, 1994       I defenestrated a clock to see if time flies!      --Lane  Smith,  quoted  in  "Who's News," [2]Time for Kids,      September 25, 1998       A  woman,  driven  to fury by the manner in which her lover      prefers  to  lavish  his  attention on a match on the telly      rather than her, starts to throw his possessions out of the      window.  He's  finally  moved to stop her when she tries to      defenestrate his new Puma boots.      --Jim White, "Budgets substantial enough to buy most of the      clubs in the Endsleigh," [3]Independent, April 6, 1996      _________________________________________________________     Defenestrate  is  derived from Latin de-, "out of" + fenestra,    "window." The noun form is defenestration."  Anywho.. Today I am alive and well and having fun.. The End..

      OK, It's been a long time but it is the return of the drunken Blog!!  First off, let me rant..  I have this thing, (there used to be more of it before the operation.. But seriously..) sometimes I realise what a shitty excuse for life the human race can be sometimes.. We like to fool ourselves with our illusions about how wonderfull humanity is.. We created Art and Music... Civilisation and social intercourse (hehe.. he said intercourse..) yet we forget the mistakes of our past..  How many of you identify with the Nazi's who sectioned of the jews and homosexuals and then when everyone in the country had forgotten them the quietly killed them off and burnt them?  Or maybe you want to remember you are part of the same species that killed HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people in Rwanda?  What about the species that goes to war on the basis of looking for weapons of mass destruction when what you really want to do is leverage your power base in the international arena (oh yeah, and secure the oil sources for the next few decades even though you know that all you are doing is working for the oil companies in the knowledge that in 50 years or so there will be no oil left but by then it'll be someone elses problem)  Think about it because this is you.. The problem with people is that they think that civilisation is an individual thing and just because someone else did it as long as you don't do it then things will be ok.. That just isn't enough..  Civilisation is a beast unto itself.. And until people actively try to make things better then that chances are it will just get worse..  That's my .02 cents on that for the moment..  On the plus side.. My plan for the night (after I got ditched by the boys..) was to sit at home and get drunk and depressed.. I know that sounds strange but I actually look forward to it.. I find it refreshing to spend a night drinking whatever I can get my hands on and then spend the night getting emotional and crying to myself.. It exorcises the demons I don't even know are there and it has been so long since my last drunk and depressed night that I can't even remember the details of what depressed me last time..  So here I am sitting at home drunk and writing on my blog..  Wanna know what I a depressed about??  You know you do :)  Have I gotten you all worked up about it yet??  I'll tell you if you promise to keep it to yourself..  I have your word?  The answer is....  Nothing.. I feel a slight sensation of melancholie but I know what that is about and it ain't the all consuming depresion I look forward to normally..  How depressing is that eh??  Oh well.. I guess next time I'll have to work harder.. Drink more faster and the like eh?  So.. Have I got anything else to add to this farcicle blog?  Nope.. I think I'll just have to go to bed before I "Defenstrate" my laptop.. (Have YOU been paying attention to my recent blogs?? ;))  Good Night,  Good Fight.

      OK.. I know when I am beaten and boy am I beaten..  I played pool today with Orla and again got my ass handed to me.. I didn't even manage to win one by default because she didn't fuck up once!  This is so not fair :(  Actually, I really enjoyed it to be honest :) I like a challenge and pool seems to be a new challenge for me to try and get my teeth into.  Also I have started putting content into my new site ;)  Looking for salsa peeps to volunteer some time to put listings of what's on where into the site. I am finding it very slow going getting all the details in so any and all help is appreciated (Just put anything you know of in and I'll approve it ASAP.. Where possible try and get the text from the promoters own sites because I don't want to be accused of favouritism by mistake when someone thinks the other promoter got a better "write up")  Also I moved into Orlas this weekend :) I have to say I am finding it very dificult to motivate myself to go out.. You know that just moved in feeling when you are in a new place and you just want to enjoy it for a while? Couple that with the desire to spend time on the couch with someone you love having a nice glass of wine and watching something (anything) on tv.. (Once she doesn't get too cranky..) and it's hard to find reasons to leave the house :)  Anywho.. I gots to go (Orla is up at like 5.30 or something ridiculous like that in the morning..) so it's of to bed for the man with no fore-skin..  Good night, and good fight..

      Hmmm Not a lot to blog really..  Work is stress still.. Hopefully it will all work out in the next while.. Lots to decide and see what I am going to do..  Dum de Dum and Stuff..  Also vaguely thinking about adding a feature to our blogs that will let people sign up to a blog mailing list and get a copy of any and all blogs mailed to them as they are posted.. What do people think of that?? You like/You hate?  And then there was silence..

      Hmm, Just remembered betting Jonny 20 Euro to his ten (me and Orla both put ten in) that he couldn't do 25 pushups..  It was so funny..  I would like to state for the record he did 12 GREAT pushups and 13 PATHETIC ones. He made it to 25 but not fast enough for it not to cost him 10 Euro ;)

      Last night I had a small drink with Jonny.. Half a bottle of whiskey later and I'm feeling great :)  I have to say.. Having a good long talk with Jonny last night was exactly what I needed.. I've been letting my stress build up too much recently and it's all been getting on top of me so spending a good night with the J-Money was great.  LOL.. As I write this I am slowly but surely remembering things.. Jonny cupped my naked testicles last night.. Wow that was strange.. Add to that my using electrodes on his naked stomach at their full power and you get a rather strange memory and mental image.. STRANGE..  As I remember more I'll let you know :)  (By the way he liked the feel ;P)

Having trouble coming to terms with some things but I don't think that it's a bad thing and I know it'll be ok soon enough.. Just need to get used to it.. (Cryptic eh.. I wonder how many people are going to ask me if I am talking about them..)  I think I finaly have a plan of action with regards to work.. I see a light at the end of the tunnel and I even know how to get there.. It's actually all thanks to a surprising source.. Lets just hope it doesn't all fall through on me in a gust of bluster..  Salsa site is all in place now, so I just need to start getting you lot to actually start using the site.. If you are even VAGUELY into salsa PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE spend some time putting stuff into the different sections.. Put in links to all your favourite salsa sites.. Put in your favourite salsa combos in the articles section, put in links to pages with video clips in the downloads sections. Put in listings for any clubs I may have missed.. ANYTHING!! I want to launch the site but want to have a little bit more in there before I start telling people about it!!  K, I gots to dash..  Love you bye, bye.

      Long time no Blog.. I know..  Where to start..  Work wise things are extremely bleak at the moment.. You know when you add up everything you owe and everything you have coming in and it just doesn't make the same figure.. It's like that and not in a good way.. I'm sure I'll stumble on through but boy can life be stressfull sometimes...  Personally things are ok at the moment.. Got a bit of.. Strange news today but nothing terrible, just strange.. Had a huge blow up with the family recently too which was funny.. Had an argument with my Dad about a load of things and then when talking with my mum I said that I did see Dads point of view on one thing (Only saw his point of view, didn't agree, but obviously I shouldn't have gone that far) Anyway I could do no right where that was concerned so I just left it.  Back to work for the moment.. I think the problem is that Step Thru is too big for one person but too small for two people.. Hmmm Maybe I should look at how it's structured.. I think I will have to try and make some time to have a serious look at the whole thing from top to bottom..  You know that feeling where you've kinda lost control and you can't quite get a grasp on things.. That's me right now..  GRRR

      Just got this in E-mail and I had to share the wealth so to speak:  I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened :  Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was "something wrong" with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room.  "He's just lying there looking sick," he told me. "I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?"  I put my best hamster-healer statement on my face and followed him into his bedroom.  One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed.  I immediately knew what to do.  "Honey," I called, "come look at the hamster !"  "Oh, my gosh" my wife diagnosed after a minute.  "She's having babies."  "What ?" my son demanded. "But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom !"  I was equally outraged.  "Hey, how can that be ?  I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce"  I accused my wife.  "Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage ?" she inquired. (I actually think she said this sarcastically !)  "No, but you were supposed to get two boys !"  I reminded her, (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together). "Yeah, Bert and Ernie !"  my son agreed.  "Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know" she informed me.  (Again with the sarcasm, ya think ?)  By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it.  "Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience, I announced.  "We're about to witness the miracle of birth."  "OH, Gross !", they shrieked.  "Well, isn't THAT just Great !  What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies ?" my wife wanted to know.  (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. don't you ?)  We peered at the patient.  After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. "We don't appear to be making much progress"  I noted.  "It's breech" my wife whispered, horrified.  "Do something Dad !" my son urged.  "Okay, okay."  Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug.  It disappeared.  I tried several more times with the same results.  "Should I call 911 ?" my eldest daughter wanted to know.  "Maybe they could talk us through the trauma." (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)  "Let's get Ernie to the vet," I said grimly.  We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap.  "Breathe, Ernie, breathe," he urged. "I don't think hamsters do Lamaze," his mother noted to him. (Women can be so cruel to their own young.  I mean what she does to me is one thing, but this boy is of her womb, for God's sake.)  The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass.  "What do you think, Doc, a c-section ?"  I suggested scientifically.  "Oh, very interesting," he murmured.  "Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment ?"  I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.  "Is Ernie going to be okay ?" my wife asked.  "Oh, perfectly," the vet assured us.  "This hamster is not in labor.  In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen...Ernie is a boy."  "What !?"  "You see, Ernie is a young male.  And occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um.... er.... masturbate.  Just the way he did, lying on his back." He blushed, glancing at my wife.  "Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr..Cameron."  We were silent, absorbing this.  "So Ernie's just...just...Excited ?", my wife offered. "Exactly," the vet replied, relieved that we understood.   More silence. Then my viscous, cruel wife started to giggle.  And giggle.  And then even laugh loudly.  "What's so funny ?" I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness.  Tears were now running down her face  "It's just...that...I'm picturing you pulling on its...its...teeny little..." she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.  "That's enough," I warned. We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamster and our son back into the car.  He was glad everything was going to be okay. "I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad," he told me.  "Oh, you have NO idea," my wife agreed, collapsing with laughter.

      Lots to say and nothing to say..  I saw the weirdest TV show today. Digital has a lot to answer for.. There is a channel called reality TV and on it today was a show called cheaters. It is the weirdest thing. People contact the show and they get investigators to follow and survey their partners who they suspect are cheating on them. Then when all the evidence is gathered they confront the cheating spouse while they are with their love monkeys.  This has to be the lowest of the low.. What is the world coming to?  I love TV. REALLY really love TV. I watch anything and everything on TV.. But this years TV is trying my Patience.. Tonight Sky Ones line up was Mr. Personality (A show where a woman date 25 masked men and spends a load of time waiting to choose which one she is going to MARRY. Only what she is MARRIED does she get to see what her husband looks like) Then there was John Leslie: My year of hell followed by six degrees of penetration.. (Who slept with who among the rich and famous) Not one thing is even vaguely intellectually stimulating or socially challenging.  I also flicked over to sex and the city today and got there at the bit where the blonde with terrible clothes (The lead) was saying something about how there should be some sort of state funded halfway house for boyfriends who have broken up with their girlfriends until they can get back on their feet.. Yes.. Thats a priority.. Ignore the people who cant read and write.. Oh yeah and all the homeless (Hey Bubbs) What about the people who have been downsized and have been on welfare for the last 5 years.. Never mind the legions of people who die all the time just because they cant afford healthcare.. What really matters are your Enter Designer name Shoes and who did who with what..  It infuriates me.. How can this be the best that our society can do???  Anyway..  What else to say  Went to the dentist today.. I have had a thing about dentists (In that I avoid them) for the last six years or so and today I learnt (thanks to some excellent nagging from Orla) that actually they arent as bad as I once thought.. I had two fillings today, Tuesday I get a tooth out, Week after I get another tooth out and then the week after two more fillings and then Ill be sexy again.. WooHooo!  There has been some other stuff going on but to be honest it is all a bit too personal for blogging (Yes,  I do know what I said after my last drinking session.. Just think.. What could be so personal that I wont say it here??) Its nothing bad.. In fact I think it is all pretty damn good really.  Anyway.. I have a mad few days weeks and months ahead of me to make things work but it is all looking good so far.. Ill keep you all posted..  Good night, Good fight..

      What a wierd weekend.. First strange thing was a phone call from Alan on Saturday morning..  "Hey Mike, have you got any stuff left in the flat in Ranelagh?"  "Yeah a few bits, I'm going to collect them now" "Not any more you don't!" "What?" "The Flat burnt down last night, it isn't there anymore" "You're shitting me"  Yes I actually said "You're shitting me".. A few phone calls later and I am still none the wiser so I head in for a look.. I have to say Jonny.. You really know how to throw a party ;)  I have to say the damage wasn't as bad as it could have been but the flat is pretty fucked up allright. I actually managed to salvage quite a few bits and pieces. There is nothing like a flat burning down to help you clear out the rubbish you collect in life..  Anyway.. The rest of the weekend was pretty good.. I actually went to Salsa on Sunday (I have so little motivation for salsa at the moment.. Myself and Orla have decided to make a point of going every Tues and Thurs but I actually don't find myself thinking I can't wait to get to salsa..) I don't know if my lack of motivation is a personal or a boredom thing.. Must track that little bugger of a thought down some day soon..  As I mentioned recently I think I may have found a light at the end of the work related tunnel, as soon as I figure out exactly what the plan is I shall reveal some of it :)  K, That's me for now.. C ya..

      What a weekend.. I was nearly dead. Sunday morning I could barely move..  Orla gave me a great backrub on Sunday evening but I am still wrecked..  I was helping my old company move offices and on the Sat Morning I had to rip up a quarter of the main office floor to move some power and network points.. My poor back has never known such strain..  Anyway.. To top it all off I had a tooth out this morning (Again orla was kind enough to take care of me again today.. I don't know what I did right in a previous life but the Karma overflow has been great this time round.. :P)  Think that is all I really have to blog for the moment. Gonna go get into my Pyjamas and relax for the rest of the day :P

Surprised but it all sounds good (Congrats babe!)  I have no idea what to write.. I think I must just be in one of my low points.. I get them every now and again..

      HeHe.. I am sitting here waiting for some blood to dry and I finally have a net connection again (Damn Lightning) so I thought I'd take the time to do a quick blog.  Had an absolutely amazing weekend.. Friday night myself and Orla went for Drinks.. Started out with a little light shopping for Orla and Siobhan and a little light drinking for me and J-Money (Yes, the great Ash.. I haven't seen him since the fire of '03..) in Capitol.  Then me and Jonny met up with Orla in Ba Mitzu, A few drinks (and the now fabled "Dave" turning up) later and all is slightly fuzzy with the world.. Off to chips and a quick stop in Ri-Ra to realize just how drunk we are.. I get sappy when drunk and apparently I was drunk from the chippy on.. I have only Orlas word for this so I assume she lies and I am just too damn sexy to resist when drunk so she took me home.. Again I was drunk so I refute the accusation that I collapsed into bed and crashed comatose.. I think I was a sex god and she just doesn't wanna admit it..  Then on Sat we were just too damn hungover for anything more than the basic activities of the day.. Spent the evening watching DVD's and relaxing really.. Again.. VERY nice :)  Hmm Sunday.. What did I do sunday.. Ah yes, Sunday went up to my mothers for a little while then went on to Dinner in Coopers and a movie (Second Hand Lions, Bloody brilliant movie if you want something a little different..  Monday then was another relaxing day. Did home stuff with the GF.. (I love doing home stuff with the GF..)  Then today I had my last battle with the Dentist, Last tooth out and I am finally done! Wh0ot!  K, I think my Blood is ALMOST dry so I am gonna go put on another coat..  See you all Spoon.

      Hello all :)  Just a quick post really.. Want to get this out there before anyone else does..   NEW YEARS EVE!   We are having a party and you are all invited, but there is (as always) a catch.. You gots to dress up! Not only that but there's a theme..   Heaven or Hell...   So get your thinking hats on, we are giving you loads of notice so there is no excuse not to have the best costume there.. A serious effort is expected :)

      K, time to let you all in on what's going on with the company I suppose..  Things are both good and bad at the moment.. Unfortunately I am going to have to close Step Thru as a company.. I tried putting it off as long as I could but a limited company for one person is just too much to handle and I have been killing myself to try and keep it alive but I have realised that it's just a company and I was fighting to keep a name alive when it made more sense to close the company and re-open as something else..  So that is the plan.  I need to sort out a few legal and financial bits and pieces and then I can officially close up shop as Step Thru. Now I know that sounds like a bad thing but really it isn't.. Why? Because I am re-opening immediately as a new company. This new company will start of in a MUCH better position than Step Thru was ever in and will allow me to take on work that I have been unable to do yet.  I also have a REALLY good friend coming over from England to work with me which I have to say is going to make the world of difference.. I have been working essentially on my own for the last few months (Bubbles has been a life saviour but would say himself that he is hardly a savant of the computer world) and it's a hard thing to motivate yourself to work when you haven't got someone else pushing as well..  Add to that the fact that work is slowly starting to pick up again and the world really does seem a brighter place :)  Anywho, I had better put my nose back to that grind-stone.  ttyl ;)

      I'm realising more and more that life is only as difficult or complicated as you make it.. I know only too well that it's hard to see that when you are actually in the middle of the hard stuff but it's actually true.  When you get down to it how bad can anything really be? I've spoken about something similar before but what the hell lets say it again..  If you look back on your life I'm sure you have all had a time when you just couldn't see how life would ever be the same or ok again. (especially when you're younger ;P) So what happened?? You picked yourself up and kept going, you did whatever it took to make it all work and eventually it did, one day you realised you were actually laughing again and it wasn't just the laugh of someone who is trying to fit in with everyone around you but you really were having fun again.  That's a big example but it works even better for the little things if you can remember that in 5 years time you won't even remember feeling stressed at all.  There's been lots going on for me but it's all sorting itself out slowly but surely thanks to a lot of work and a lot of help from the people that matter..  Thanks..

      Hmmm, Strange few days.. Last two nights I watched two pretty heavy movies (Mystic River and Antwone Fisher) Both of which included fairly major plot points about child sexual abuse.  As most of you know already I was abused in secondary school for a couple of months, and whenever I see a movie like that it always reminds me of that time and leaves me dwelling on it for a while. This in general is actually quite healthy and I have spent a long time dealing with the issues surrounding it so overall I am fine, but two nights in a row was slightly heavier going than I am used too.  It also got me thinking about friends of mine who have had their own issues (all sorts of issues.. many and varied etc.) and have this super blinkered approach to them.. How can you show someone that the best thing for them is something that they can't even bear the thought of doing..  Anyway. Enough of the heacy stuff..  TTYL Peeps

      Hmmm..  I had a great weekend but am feeling a bit down at the moment.. Don't really know why, good day at work and things are all pretty good these days.  Anyway, the weekend..  Had an absolutely brilliant time, I had he bestest house m8's EVA!  I only realise afterwards that I only went to two classes all weekend but it was still a great time..  Myself and Bubbles decided last Tuesday that we would enter the Open floor competition but only started working on the routine at 4PM on Saturday.. 7 Hours later we were performing it and it actually came out surprisingly well.. We managed to hit all the cues we had planned for ourselves and kept the routine reasonably in order. Also had an absolutely amazing time performing it.. It was a great laugh and we managed to do what have fun as we did it.  Quite tired now, maybe that's what has me down.. Anyway, dum de dum..

      If you can' beat them..  Thoughts flow through my mind, intimating deeper urges and thoughts but with no direction or goal.  The past catches me unawares, reminding me of pain long gone that's still part of me today.  Where did it come from, how did it get here, Where is it going.  Life is a dream yet to be fulfilled, Hope is the dream incomplete, Dreams. What are they really.  Life flows, Dreams go, Who knows..

      Just saw heard a quote on TV today and th emotions from it were very familiar..  "I want my father to be proud of me"  "I'm sure your father loves you"  "NO! Not love, Pride.."  Made me think about my own relationship with my dad in a way I hadn't looked at it before and I realised that is a lot of what drives me too.  I know my father loves me.. I amn't really really certain that he is proud of me, it's something that is a lot less certain.. Everyones parents loves them (you included bubbs, much as you'd hate to admit it) but there is no built in thing that means a parent will be proud of them..  Anyway, Just a random mind dump. Straight from my head to the internet.

      Just found this online, Read the full article, it rocks :)  urlLink The Mind of a Man - Trustworthy, Physician-Reviewed Information from WebMD : "When he sprawls on the couch with the remote at the end of the day, a guy may not be deliberately ignoring his wife or girlfriend. The male brain rejuvenates differently than the female brain does, Gurian says. 'Using brain scans, University of Pennsylvania neuroscientist Ruben Gur found that the male brain goes to a rest state to rejuvenate much more than the female brain does. To build brain cells and restore himself, a man needs to 'zone out,'' Gurian says. That's why he channel-surfs or stares at the computer.  But the female brain, thanks to all that oxytocin, wants to bond at the end of the day in order to rejuvenate. 'She wants to talk, using all those verbal centers, and she wants to get close to him,' Gurian says. But the timing's all off. 'If the wife takes a break and vents first to someone else -- a friend on the phone, perhaps -- and lets her husband rejuvenate during that zone-out period, he'll be much more prepared to listen later on, during dinner, for example. It's all about timing.' "

It was fine when it was just me but my situation has changed now. I have more to worry about than me.. Also expecting the worst doesn't help a relationship in any way..  So, what do I do? What I always do.. Work at it and as always hope for the best..  Hmmmmm

      I feel like shit.. I feel like giving up..  Why do I try.. I spent years straightening myself out. I always go as far as possible out of my way to try and help my friends.. I try my best to do what's right and while I may not always manage to do that I never intentionaly hurt anyone and will always try and repair any damage or hurt I have done to anyone.  I am still best friends with my last 3 Ex's... Who do you know that can say that? The break up of a relationship is usually about as hurtfull as you can get and so far I have managed to repair most of the hurt I have caused. And anyone who knows me (I mean anyone who really knows me) knows that they can ALWAYS come to me with any gripe and I will do any and every thing I can to try and repair the damage.. So much so that I have often ended up doing more than I should for people that don't really deserve it but to me it will always be worth it to try and fix a friendship..  Even with all this and all the effort I try to make life still keeps kicking me in the balls.. Just when I think things are finally starting to come together and that life may actually start to feel like something other than a struggle along something comes out of no-where and kicks me in the teeth. Yesterday I found out something that was so horrible I still haven't quite come to terms with it. I actually can't believe it is happening. I've spent the last 2 days on the verge of tears. I haven't been this upset for as long as I can remember and it came from somewhere I never expected.  I feel like shit.. I feel like giving up.. I can't make sense of anything anymore and it's just plain SHIT.

      Christmas and New years eh..  I have to say it was a mixed holiday for me. Some bits were truely great and some bits left me feeling pretty shitty.. On one hand I had a nice break, spent some really good time with Orla, had two great parties (The poker night was particularly good) and got time to catch up with some of the movies.  On the flip side it was actually a bit of a lonely season this year.. I realised at the end of the holidays that over the whole 2-3 weeks I hadn't managed to see any of my close friends that I don't actually live with\live with their boy-friends. Strange eh..  Oh well, maybe the new year will be better for me.. I'm going to be insanely busy for the next 2 months so that has to be a vaguely good thing really, doesn't it?

I didn't have to worry about lots of the things that I need to do on a day to day basis during the week.  I actually got to read my last three months back log of web-comics!

Got the office sorted out too so I can actually do some real work during the day! Woohoo!!

      So, the internet has again come to my aid. I was sitting in work bored and decided to try typing www.iambored.com into my address bar. Wh0oT! Internet Games for someone like me!! It's like someone said, you know what? I bet Michael will type this address into his browser one day and we should really be ready for him!  Anywho, The front of the cafe is now orange.. I have to say it looks even better than I thought it would! Go me!  Also I decided to extend my "hair loss" activities recently and decided to try using imac all the way up to just under my chest. I have to say it was rather rocking and I was well pleased.. Then came the hair growth. My plan was to wait till it's long enough to wax and then get rid of it proper like. OH MY GOD DOES IT ITCH.. I can not wait for tonight\tomorrow.. I never thought I would look forward to the torture that is waxing but anything would be better than this.  Little bit worried about a friend who is sick at the moment. I know she will be fine but you know how it is.. Hoping she gets better soon and everything goes ok today.. Know she doesn't read this but want to put the good vibes out there anyway..  Hmm, what else is going on eh?  Oh yeah, I'm going to try and actually start to work on web stuff again sometime soon (possibly starting today)  Going to TRY and do something about the whole comment thing as fast as I can.. I am so sorry about all the probs just glad it isn't my code that sucks donkey cock..  K, back to work or something.. Talk to you all whenever you finally make it to the cafe because these days I am either here or at home.. I have no life anymore..

Everything I tried discovered another problem in that hunk of crap that my customers like to call a server, only now have I finally gotten the machine to a stage where I can get the old files off to a new computer which still isn't a fix, it just lets my customer finally start working again.  GAH!!! I'm exhausted and I have to go to bed now but I can't.. Want it all to end.

      What's going on with me this week? Being honest I don't know what it is and how to explain it, I've had a week from hell to be honest. On Tuesday my Mum and Dad agreed on their divorce settlement.  I don't know really what to say about it actually. Being honest I am ashamed of my Dad. I love my Dad and would do anything for him but the one thing I wish I could do for him is knock some sense into him. When it comes down to it the most important thing in my Dad's life is him. Last Tuesday he had an oportunity to actually do the right thing, to give my Mum a decent offer that reflected what she deserved, instead what she finnaly managed to haggle out of him for a deal is something I would have been ashamed to make as a first offer in his position.  It's a terrible thing, being ashamed of a person you can't help loving.  Since Tuesday I have also felt completely exhausted, some of it is the hours I have worked but a lot of it is all the stress. Ahh I dunno, I'm sure I'll be fine in the end.

      What to say...  Well, I'm having a pretty crap week and it's only half way through. I'm feeling very alone when it comes to work at the moment. It's like I'm constantly banging my head against a wall of incompetence. A huge part of me is on the verge of just packing it all in and going home.  One thing is definite. I am not going to start any more companies with people I have never worked with before. So far with the exception of wayne who I have already worked with, I have yet to find a single person that I have been impressed or even satisfied with in work.  My whole life seems to be spent now double checking and then having to redo everything I have asked anyone else to do.  Now what? I don't know what to do. I honestly don't and the constant low level stress I have is going to end up killing me if I don't do something soon...

      I found an interesting interview on Salsa Spot today :)  urlLink Toronto salsa dancing SPOT - Salsa dancing resource for Toronto: events, clubs, instructors, music and scene   I have to say my favourite part was:  What is your type of woman? (This was a tough question: Joshua tried to wiggle out of it in any way possible, but still, here it comes)!    I also liked  "I feel that this year is the one where I will be able to enjoy the gathering and harvesting from the previous years."  I really hope he does finally reap what he sows..

      Trust with me is an interesting and fickle beast. It takes a lot to win my trust as a friend and it is almost impossible to achieve it as a girlfriend.  There are two reasons for this, both of which come from the same incident in my life.  When I was younger (yes even younger than I am now) I was in a Job that paid me more per year than I have ever earned since and it will be at least a year before I start earning that much again. I also had a Girlfriend that I loved. My first love as it happens. Me and her had always had an "interesting" relationship. She had cheated on me several times and every time I had accepted the reasons and believed it wouldn't happen again. In part I also felt guilty because I had been unfaithful to her too once. (The only time I have ever done such a thing ever, despite what a certain someone has said about me behind my back.. You still reading this?)  Anyway, she had this friend. He was an Ex from WAY WAY back. Over a period of months we all became friends and one day he found out his flat was being sold and he was stuck for somewhere to move to. I offered to rent him my spare room (did I mention I was well paid) and a few weeks later he moves in.  Now I know at this stage you all think you know what's coming but unfortunately you don't.  I started to suspect that something was going on but was re-assured over and over that it was all in my warped mind. Eventually the inevitable happened. I came home at an unexpected time and found my girlfriend in bed with my Flat Mate. Horrible huh? But hey, this stuff happens all the time..  Did I mention there was more?  I confront them and they actually deny that anything happened. They just fell asleep in a bed together naked watching a program. Nice try if I hadn't seen her sweep up a used condom from the floor. I was devastated.  Then over the next few days my already fucked up world got worse. I found out that she hadn't just been sleeping with him. Turns out she was sleeping with all of his friends  For money.  And sharing that money with him.  My Flatmate was pimping my girlfriend to all his friends.  See why I have a problem trusting Girlfriends.. But What does all this have to do with friends?  I was so devastated by what happened I left my job and took two months out and at the end of that I decided to try and go it alone, which meant I had to be very careful with my cash. No more spending money on party's and all my friends.  Guess what.. No Money? No Friends.  In the space of one month I lost everyone that I thought of as a friend.  So when it comes to me and relationships I won't take risks anymore. I just can't go through all that crap anymore.  Orla is the first girlfriend I have had that I have even started to trust (it is by no means over, I have a long way to go) and when it comes to friends I will go to the ends of the earth.  There is a flip side.  I demand a high standard from my friends. I have to be able to trust the people that are close to me. That is what I give to my friends and it is what I expect.  Recently a friend thought he was doing the best thing for me, and I respect that but the way he tried to help me involved lying to me directly. If you are organising a surprise party it is one thing but putting a gun to my head is another.  I will always respect and appreciate this friend, but I can't see myself having the some opinion of them that I had before.  I have always said to my Girlfriends that if they were ever unfaithful to me no matter what the situation that would be it. Never again would I be able to see them the same way. Friends it turns out are more like girlfriends than I ever would have guessed..

      And so it continues.. I have been contacted by a lot of people to ask me why I took down my earlier posts. The truth of the matter is that some people aren't worth the hastle they cause and as such they can push people to do things that they don't want to do. With that in mind I will strengthen my resolve and post a clarification of my earlier posts.  Anyone has a problem with that they can write me a letter.  (Yes I have checked since, Texts are not admisable in court and are not accepted as official\legal documentation)  One more thing, I had a problem with someone and I wrote it on my blogs. I did not contact anyone closely related to that person. I didn't advertise the fact I had a problem. I just wrote it in my web diary.  Someone rang my co-worker and then went on to ring my Girl-Friend. In the greater scheme of things they left messages on the phones of people that affect my life directly and voiced their opinions on me. Libel Damage wise I am apparently winning the case right there. (Did I mention I was checking up on these issues myself..)  So said, I'm not a small minded bitter person and I have no intention so far of pursuing these matters. However, my Girlfriend is out of bounds as far as I am concerned and if anyone (Present or future) uses my girlfriend to try and get to me I won't accept it and I will not just let it go.  Enough said

      Oh what a morning :)  I got a call from "anyone who needs to know does know" this morning. He was not a happy bunny. Turns out he doesn't think my opinion of him is very accurate.  I should say that everything I say in my blog is my personal opinion. If anyone has a problem with anything I post I will happily remove it or clarify what I am saying.  As it turns out I just received a text from "he who shall not be named". He has told me "You have one week to remove that stuff and with draw your comment. Or i will see you in court."[Sic] so I sent back a text to say that if he sends me an official request I will happily remove it. His response? "Text is official these days. The choice is yours. U should not have started this, it was too much to ignore"[Sic]  I'm not sure what he means by I should not have started this. Everything I wrote was written a long time ago and I find it funny he has suddenly decided to act on it if it is so serious and he knew about it for a long time, which apparently he has.  I'm also very dubious about the legality of SMS text messages as an official form of communication.  So said I am happy to remove the posts and I officially retract any posts I previously made about Josh. (Just realised I have to say his name to retract what I said about him before, oh well)

       10 ways to terrorise your flatmate  10) Collect potatoes. Paint faces on them and give them names. Name one after your flatmate. Separate your flatmate's potato from the others. Wait a few days, and then bake your flatmate's potato and eat it. Explain to your flatmate, saying 'He just didn't belong'  9) Move everything to one side of the room. Ask your flatmate if he knows how much an elephant weighs, and look at the floor on the empty side of the room with concern.  8) Draw a tiny black line on your nose. Make it bigger every day. Look at it and say, 'the hair, it's growing. Growing!'  7) Buy some knives. Sharpen them every night. While you're doing so, look at your flatmate and mutter, 'Soon, soon...'   6) Collect hundreds of pens and pile them on one side of the room. Keep one pencil on the other side of the room. Laugh at the pencil.  5) Tell your flatmate, 'I've got an important message for you.' Then pretend to faint. When you recover, say you can't remember what the message was. Later on, say, 'Oh, yeah, I remember!' Pretend to faint again. Keep this up for several weeks.  4) While your flatmate is out, glue your shoes to the ceiling. When your flatmate walks in, sit on the floor, hold your head, and moan.  3) Make a sandwich. Don't eat it, leave it on the floor. Ignore the sandwich. Wait until your flatmate gets rid of it, and then say, 'Hey, where the feck is my sandwich!?' Complain loudly that you are hungry.  2) Every time your flatmate walks in yell, 'Hooray! You're back!' as loud as you can and dance around the room for five minutes. Afterwards, keep looking at your watch and saying, 'Shouldn't you be going somewhere?'  1) Talk back to your Rice Krispies. All of a sudden, act offended, throw the bowl on the floor and kick it. Refuse to clean it up, explaining, 'No, I want to watch them suffer.'

      So.  I dunno really.. I feel.. Hmmmm..  Since my post the other day about some of the things that have happened to me. It's wierd you think that something doesn't really matter. You know it still affects you in some ways but you also think it's not a big deal, then you realise that actually a lot of the things that you feel and the ways you react are changed forever because of something stupid.  I hate what I've become sometimes. I have no tolerance for certain things and has really screwed me up when it comes to relationships.  Last night I went to a Table Quiz with Orla and some friends of hers. One of them was an Ex of hers and I just found it so hard to handle it. After we picked him and his friend up I just felt really uncomfortable. I must have come across like such a prick but I just couldn't handle making small talk. I eased up a bit as the night went on but when it comes down to it all I could think about was what happened before.. What a pile of crap.  The thing is I have no problem with the Ex, he's a nice guy and I  know  I can trust Orla..  The problem is with me and I can't seem to get the damn monkey off my back..

      And on to a rant.  I went to  urlLink Britneys  concert last night..  I went to it thinking this should be good, if nothing else apparently the show is raunchy as all hell!  Who ever thought that show was raunchy must have spent the last ten years in a nunnery. I have seen raunchier paint drying! Add to that the unbelievably bad Lip Syncing and you have a terrible show.. At one stage she was singing one of those girly slow songs while on a trapeze swing type contraption and while "singing" she stopped to scratch her nose and chew her gum!  I have no problem with a bit of lip syncing especially during intense dance routines but when people pay the kinda prices that they were charging for tickets you expect the main person in the show to make a bit of effort and I think that was my main problem with the show, she made no effort.  Over all a very VERY disappointing show.

This has made possible the National Football League.  "We cannot tolerate the proliferation of this paperwork any longer. It is useless to fight the forms. We must kill the people producing them."

      So. My girlfriends been bitching at me again because I haven't blogged so as usual she is making me do this.  I've been watching a new series on TV called Joan of Arcadia.. I have to say it is surprisingly good. It's about a girl who gets visted by God and asked to do things. The whole show is based on the fact she never sees the bigger consequences of her actions, she still thinks all she is doing is these pointless tasks that mean nothing but indirectly they are making huge differences.  Anyway, work is going well again. It's a hard slog but I am getting things together and making huge steps forward. About to do a huge sales push to so hopefully things will be getting really busy soon..  Ah I dunno, I don't really have anything to say, I'm really just typing for the hell of it. Lets see how I feel once I've had a night off.

      Murphy posted  urlLink this interesting piece  and it got me thinking about family and I have to say thinking about that always makes me think about how bloody stupid us men can be sometimes..  Come to think of it both halves of the species can be really fupped up. Everyone seems to forget that it is the little things that make the big differences, it doesn't take much to make a person happy (unless you are Bubbles that is)  All anyone really wants these days is to feel that their partner cares about them and that they matter to them. And the same the other way around. It's like dancing, a woman wants to be taken to the dance floor and made to feel like the most important woman in the world. Guys it has to be said are "generally" a lot easier to please.. Give us the occasional kiss (Ok, maybe a bit more often, I can be a bit demanding when it comes to the kissy kissy) Beer and a movie at home every now and again and some of the nice loving. But when it comes down to it both sides of the fence are like that.  I guess my point is that you have to put something into a relationship to get something out of it..

      Suddenly I feel pressure to write.. There was always a few friends that I knew read my blog but in the last week loads of random people have started reading it (Hi Krista :D Everyone go read her blog: http://krista-rant.blogspot.com/ )  So now here comes the pressure. I'm no Silver Tongued  Alvin T. Grey , all I know is random useless facts and of course how to search for weird things online (It's my own personal hobby, like this search for aardvark related riddles:  urlLink Click Here )  I do occasionally blog about the most inappropriate things, but hey who doesn't so nothing strange there. (Like the  urlLink Aardvark Porn Video Store . Noticing a theme today??)   urlLink This is quite a funky aardvark site..   Anyway, I suppose I better write something about my day really.. I'm afraid today was a bit boring really, This morning was a pain in the ass work morning, Wayne went onsite to a customer where we spent 3 hours going round in circles trying to get their net connection when suddenly it just started working again when we put it back to the original settings that had stopped working in the first place, I hate it when that happens..  Then this afternoon I actually had a really good work meeting, met a guy who will probably start selling our techie services to his customers which is a HUGE help.  Now I just need to put together a few quotes for customers and things will be flying!  Now what.. Hmmmmm, No, think that is about all I can say.. If I think of anything really interesting I'll make sure to post it here.  hehe

      Recently I have had an influx of people I have never met reading my blogs which is a bit mad for me.. (If you get a chance check out CarrieF's Blog  urlLink ::LipSticking:: . Has some great stuff in there!)  Anyway it has prompted me to have a look through my old posts and see what has changed and I have to say that my posts have changed a lot over the last while..  Have a look at  urlLink this page  and compare it to some of my recent posts..  I need to start picking myself up. Work is going great these days and the company is really going well.. Soon I will actually be a successful happy guy with everything going for him again. (Someone even called me an Irish Hottie recently! Woohooo!!)  I used to use this blog to talk about all kindsa subjects like how a guys testicles move all by themselves ( urlLink See Tuesdays post Here ) and about my various organs and of course my missing fore skin (I know that is common in a lot of people but I lost my foreskin when I was 21 so I keep bringing it up looking for sympathy) and these days I have recently barely managed to rustle up enough energy to bitch about stuff..  K, I am going to have to start changing things around here.. Back to the scary posts about my various sexual organs and their behaviour.

      Just haven't really felt like blogging this week. Still don't really so this is just a quick blog.  Tried shaving my stomach in an upwards direction the other day and I have to say it leaves me feeling a lot smoother but really hurts more getting it done.  It's a pity waxing doesn't seem to work on me and I still can't find anywhere that will do laser "down there". I may try getting the laser on mah belly and stick to shaving the undercarriage but ideally I wanna throw the razor in the damn bin.  Immac is pretty good but I have to wait 10 damn minutes like a prat with cream coloured stuff all over "the boys" and the crab walk is a real annoyance.  Hmmmm. Maybe I am getting a bit too discriptive... Ah well :)  Again if anyone knows a place in Ireland that will do permanent hair removal in sensitive areas let me know :)

       urlLink Crucifiction Games: Random Obituary Generator of Doom : "We regret to announce the disturbing passing of Michael Gargan, who on the 7th of March of this year was carefully vaporized by the next-door neighbor.  This unfortunate incident occurred in a sewer pipe on the Island of Tihi.  The deceased was reported to have shouted 'Well, there goes the rest of my day...' just before expiring.  Michael Gargan is survived by Gladys Happyfoot, a trained chimpanzee.  Funeral services will be held the 5th of next month."  Bubbles, how come they got your name wrong? Although I kinda like Gladys Happyfoot, I think I may just call you that from now on.

      Take the quiz:  urlLink "WHAT RELIGION BESTS SUITS YOU?"     Category Unknown  You don't fit into any of the above categories, so perhaps before you get angry or confused, check what other religion(s) you scored the highest on. For example, you might be a Christian-Pagan, or a Discordian-Wiccan. Just use a bit of logic. However, according to this test, you're simply 100% YOU. You don't fit into any of the world's boxes.  It's funny, my breakdown was: Fundamentalist Christian (You scored 0) Holy Roller (You scored 0)  Average Christian (You scored 0)  True Christian (You scored 0)  Modern Satanist (You scored 0)  Theistic/Traditional Satanist (You scored 0)  Luciferian (You scored 0)  Devil Worshipper (You scored 0)  Atheist (You scored 2)  Agnostic (You scored 3)  New Aged/Wiccan (You scored 1)  Pagan/Occultist (You scored 0)  Discordian (You scored 0)  Category Unknown (You scored 4)   But I wouldn't define myself as an atheist at all, I have very definite belief that there is some form of God and I agree with a lot of what the different religions say but when it comes down to it I find that there is no "organised" religion out there that matches my belief.  Anyway that is enough of that.

      HeHe, Anyone who knows me knows I think about the wierdest things sometimes.. This would be no exception.. I'm coming up to my 25th Birthday and I was wondering exactly how far through life I am now.. So I went looking and found  urlLink these life expectancy statistics . So it turns out if I was born in 2002 I would have a life expectancy of 75.1 years..  I then went searching again and found the excellent Death Clock site(!) which let me build  urlLink My Personal Death Clock   So.. Turns out I am due to expire on Wednesday, October 9, 2058.  That means I am one third of the way through this old life.. I better get cracking eh!

      I have been thinking about what to write on my next blog and I was preparing quite the rant about George W Bush and Americans in general but then I came accross this article:  urlLink BBC NEWS | Business | Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist  and I have to say it changed my mood completely.  I amn't a fan of Bill Gates (I don't have any problems with him either) but then out of the blue I read that someone that a lot of the people think of as the epitomy of Capitalisms bad side has set up a trust that "Together with the British-based Wellcome Trust, which holds assets worth around £9bn, the foundation leads the world in charitable giving."  It's mad really.  Anyway, I promise a rant sometime soon.

      I'm tired.. Really really tired.  Years ago I had a huge issue with "friendships" where people I considered friends suddenly turned out to be anything but.. I then went out of my way to not take friendships at face value and to make sure I only ever make real connections with someone I think is worth it.   Taken from Dictionary.com: friendship \Friend"ship\, n. [AS. fre['o]ndscipe. See  Friend , and  -ship .] 1. The state of being friends; friendly relation, or attachment, to a person, or between persons; affection arising from mutual esteem and good will; friendliness; amity; good will. There is little friendship in the world. --Bacon. There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity. --Rambler. Preferred by friendship, and not chosen by sufficiency. --Spenser.  2. Kindly aid; help; assistance, [Obs.] Some friendship will it [a hovel] lend you gainst the tempest. --Shak.  3. Aptness to unite; conformity; affinity; harmony; correspondence. [Obs.] Those colors . . . have a friendship with each other. --Dryden.   The most apt part of that for me is "There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity."  In every relationship I have be it friendship or more I am demanding when it comes to the integrity of trust with the people I make a connection with. I have no problem with the occasional mistake, but intentional deception is too much  for me. Add to that then going on to tell someone something about me that you have no proof of and if you think about it you must realise is a lie?!  I just about give up. I have a friend, a true friend. We have our ups and downs, we go through phases where we don't see each other and when we do we are a bit distant.. We are in different places and stuff, but the thing is we always know that we are friends and that will always come first. No matter what happens that person has always been there for me and has always treated me with nothing but respect. Other friends seem to just spring from no-where and I find out this whole side that I never knew was there. Then I try to clear the air and talk to them about things and they lie to my face.  "Everything is fine, no big deal, there's no problem, really..."  If that is the case then why is it that when you talk about me behind my back you have nothing but bad things to say..  To be fair this is only really happening with two people but it is two people that I thought more of and I just can't get it.
