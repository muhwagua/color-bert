                   I am Sam. I eat green eggs and ham. To most people, I look like the average quiet, tall, and skinny guy with blond hair, blue eyes, and large head. But I'm really a weird, hyper kid. I ride bikes, as in freestyle or bmx. I play paintball and am going to start a paintball team with my friends.  I play guitar.  Though I am not really good at it, I still love to play. I live in Old Stonington, Illinois. My last is pronounced like Vangeeson.  I have noticed that everyone is weird in their own little ways, but doesn't it seem that being weird is normal now.  So in fact, we all are normal and weird at the same time. I know I am talking in circles, but I'm just crazy.               Recently, I reached a milestone. I walked through the E.R. doors for the first time. I was injured, of course.  Wait a minute.  I am getting ahead of myself.  Let start this properly.  When my cousin and I were running outside, we spotted a pumpkin. Out of sure boyish charm or pure idiocy...aren't they the same? But we decided to smash the pumpkin. I ran to get two baseball bats. Actually, it was a baseball bat and a softball bat. So my cousin takes the first swing. He hits perfectly. I hit it next. He takes another swing, but he takes a golf swing.  He is left-handed and I was standing to the right of him. I saw the bat coming before it hit me. It had hit near my eyebrow.  As I ran inside, I left a nice little blood trail. Ten minutes,  I was headed to hospital with gauze wrapped around my head.  Out of this, I got eight stitches, a terrible headache, and a smashed pumpkin. I told my cousin I wouldn't have him arrested for battery.

      Last night, I was over at my cousin house. We played games. Ping-Pong. Weight-lifting. The most tiring activity was playing hockey with really short sticks and weight pad. My back is really sore and stiff. I wish I could myself a backrub. I am really talented in giving backrubs. SNL should be good tonight. Ray Liotta is the host. I can't remember who was the musical guest. Oh well, I got to go.

      My grandfather is turning 90 on January 25. I haven't seen the man in 5 years. He wasn't at my sister's or brother's graduation party. He didn't come to my brother's wedding reception. I haven't seen for one stupid reason. No. It isn't laziness. It's because my step-grandmother.She tells us he can't come because he's sick. But it seems he's healthy enough to go see her grandchildren's soccer game in Texas. Right after my dad's graduation party, she made help clean, pack his bags, and leave. Yeah, my dad was forced to leave his house at the age of 18. Every time my dad goes over see his dad, she starts vaccuming and cleaning like he soiled something. I think this load of shit. Pardon my french.

      I have lived 16 years of my life in ancient, two-story house. Anyone who has just droven by myself tells me it's creepy. When I am home alone during night, I hear noises. There are a lot of stories to be told. Let's start with a death. That's where most horror books start, right? There was death in my house. Let's be more specific about its location. I slept near the room. Every time I would go into that room, I'd get this eerie feeling. The windows are fogged in there. I know it is just a leak in the seal or whatever,but in one window it really looks like a body up against the window. Actually the woman wasn't killed. She died of a failed brain tumor surgery. Another story, I was walking upstairs with the lights on. As I am walking up, there is this shadow walking down the stairs. I get upstairs.Nobody upstairs. Now I'm freaked. Third story, Keely, Ryan's sister, has told me she heard singing during the night. Unless I sleepwalk and sleepsing really good or the radio was on. So ends this chapter of Lifestyles of Strange and Abnormal.

       I am so freaking tired. I don't what is wrong with me lately, but I can't seem to get enough sleep. Maybe it's because of all the books I have been reading. Yep, that's it. Next time a teacher asks me to read, I am going to tell them I can't. No, I am not illiterate. At least, I hope I'm not.  I hate to say this but the people at THS don't know how lucky they are. If I went about the school as I do at home, People would think me insane.

      "Death to the Naggons!!!" "Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons" "Weirdos From Another Planet!" I don't know about you, but my favorite comic strip was Calvin and Hobbes. I have a collection of the books. It probably had the most original ideas.

      I just got done watching this show on the tube. It was Man Vs. Beast where men and animal engage in contests. There was a hot dog eating contest between a guy and a bear, a race between a guy, a girraffe, and a zebra. There was a tug-of-war between an ape and a sumo wrestler. Guess what? The animals won every time. Is it just me or these stupid little shows reproduce by budding? I mean if I want to watch reality, I'll just go outside. "What is the point of a blog?" This is the question I hear a lot from friends who don't have one. One study hall, I thought of an answer  to that question. A blog is simply a thing to complain, think, and spill your guts onto. It also lets people have a look into your head, if you let thim. Down the road, You could look at it to see if you have changed. When your reading my or somebody else's blog, think that all you are doing is eating a piece of their mind(not literally).

      I really can't wait for spring. I want to ride my bike, but it is extremely cold. I am going to move to warmer place like California, Nevada, or Arizona. More on this later

      Over the years, I have gained some nicknames. Sambo came from my family. Samurai was from the fact that I liked ninjas and kung fu movies. Samuelson came from Ryan. Don't ask me where he came up with that. The most recent and catchy is SuperSam. This one came from me and my cousins. I had a Superman t-shirt and it stuck. I now have a SuperSam stocking cap. I haven't learned how to do supermans on a bike yet. When I do, I am going to yell 'SuperSam' every time I do them.

      Here is a little poem I wrote about bike riding. I usually don't write poetry unless I have my juices flowing. Here is a little dive into my mind.           I write. I wait.  by Samuel L. VanGeison  I write. I wait for this day to end its date. To go home is what I'll do to do things of virtue. Then I'll do something most people won't understand. I ride my bike as much as I can. Day in, Day out. I'll ride my bike without a doubt. I'll wield this piece of metal. I'll push on the pedal And there I'll glide upon this earth Glad that this machine was given birth Through me this bike lives. I'll still ride no matter how much pain it gives. Through blood,bone, and pain On this seat shall I still reign. A sound will issue on my part. Sometimes it's defeat. Sometimes it's victory. Whatever it is, it is always from the heart.  Resurfacing from dive into one's mind in 3...2...1...0. Welcome back. We hope you enjoyed you dive with Sanity.What's that? Diving  Company.

      The bunnyhop.It is probably most basic and necessary trick in bmx. It is very hard to learn if you don't have anyone to tell you what to do. Ryan and I did our first bunnyhop together. That night will probably stick in my head for the rest of my life. Ryan and I were riding around my house. He tried one and actually bunnyhoped. Then, I go crazy and do one myself. It was most likely the best day of that year. But anyways we went riding around my neighborhood. I live in the country and it was summer then. It was very misty like a beginning to a horror movie. I could barely see Ryan through the mist and we were only five feet from each other. We went out in 'the wilderness' where we play paintball and got up in this fort. We just talked about riding bikes, paintball, and girls. Then we started making fun of my cousin who thought a panther was prowling near Stonington. All of sudden, we hear something moving around in the grass. Ryan shone the flashlight at the grass but he couldn't see anything. The grass hadn't been mowed so it was five feet tall. Me and Ryan looked at each other and said 'Oh shit'. We jumped off the fort, ran out of the woods, and rode our bikes back to my house. When we got there, we heard these whispers/grass rumblings/ tuning of radio. Keely, Ryan's sister, told us later on in the year that it was very normal. It was one of the most awesome, memorable things.

      Stars. Clear River Water. Mountains. Deserts. These are the things that I would to like surround myself with. My mom is really scared of heights. I love being on cliffs and in caves. I am not much of an outdoorsman, but I like to hike a lot. Also, I am going to live near a major city in the southwest. Away from a city, you can stare at the heavens. That's my favorite part about living in Old Stonington. I grew up running around a big front and back yards. Chasing frogs, fireflies, and the occasion butterfly.

      I have question. What do the kids in the Trix commercials have against the rabbit? I would like to see the rabbit get a bowl of cereal and eat it. But the rabbit must be a Trix addict and gets high from just holding the bowl of cereal. He is really idiotic after he gets the bowl. He rambles on about the tastes and the colors. Sometimes I find myself yelling at the tv because of this, but that's just me.

      Lately, I have been trying to exercise more.But usually I just stop. I do this a lot because I'm lazy. I think a part of me wants to look better than I do.Honestly, I got screwed in the looks department because I have a high metabolism. You need weight to build muscle on. Thus is my problem. I decided to be more talkactive. I want to become this because sometimes I'm too quiet to attract attention from girls.As a kid, I'd whisper what I wanted for dinner into my sister's ear. One part of me would say I am overlooked among the crowd. The other part of me says, "No, it's because you don't talk a lot." In my whole entire life, I only have had two serious relationships. I have never been kissed. I think every time I date a girl, she usually dumps me.But this is not their fault. I choke up and can't think of anything to say. I choke up because I don't want to screw up what I have strived for. The girls that I like right now are smarter than me. I don't know what that means. I had dream about one of these girls. She and I were driving a school bus. She stopped  the bus and told me wrap the bus in aluminum. When I got to the back of the bus,it was the back of a garbage truck. Then I heard a chicken and out of nowhere drops this giant chicken. I run into the bus and we hightail it. The chicken chases us. The chicken ends up catching us and eating the girl I like. Scratch that, I really love this girl. Anyways I chase down the chicken in the bus. We end up it in a very poor, starving town. I run after the chicken. It escapes into a castle. I continue chasing it. When I come through the gate of the castle, the chicken has sword in its hand/wing. I have armor and a sword all of a sudden. We sword fight to the top of the castle. I kill the chicken, it falls off the castle, and onto a giant bbq grill. It ended with a thanksgiving/middle ages dinner. Its weird how crazy your dreams can get. I wonder what that dream would interpret into. Oh well. Another day. Another dollar.

      My New Years Resolution is to be careful. Last year, I had an aneurysm and also had to get eight stitches. An aneurysm is an expansion and weakening of an artery. If you read my first entry, you already know how I got my stitches. To those who didn't, I'll just I got hit on the right eyebrow.  Months before I got my aneurysm, I had been hit on the right side of my head with a replica gun. I bleed a little and had a little goose egg. I didn't think much about it until it didn't go away.When I put my finger on it, I could feel my pulse. So I go to the doctor. The Indian doctor in Taylorville thought it was a ciste. So he puts a needle in it." It's bleeding quite profusely," I heard. By the way, I'm not racist. Anyways, I am referred to a vascular specialist in Springfield. A week later, I was aneurysm-free. The reason I am trying to be safer is I got Driver's License. I want to be the first kid in my family not to get in wreck or total my car.

      I have to say that BMXers or skaters are really weird.  That is weird in the way of looking at things.  One day while just driving around town, I had stop to get soda. While I was walking, I saw a slide. Now, you probably thinking so what? After getting my soda and taking a sip, I started to imagine what could be done on that slide with a bike. The possiblities are endless. Funny how I said that because they aren't. Unless someone comes along and creates a bajillion tricks, they aren't endless. I mean it would take a long time to do every trick there is and every variation of it.

      "You rearrange my face but you can't rearrange my mind" This is what my sister said about fighting.  I agree mostly. Today, I heard some kid wanted to fight another kid for no real reason. Winning a fight only brings satisfaction, bruises, and burnt calories. Yes, it works for the winner if he or she really has a reason for the fight.

                 I strive to not step on anybody's toes.  I look people in face and try to see how their day has been. I talk to them and make jokes to lighten their day. Hold the door for someone. Pick up their pen they just dropped. Ask them how their day is going. You may just give them that little push to think positive. Remember the glass is half full. Start each day with the thought that you are alive, given the opportunity to learn, and you live in free country where you can anything that is legal(that is if you live in America). I am trying not to swear a lot because I would like to show people that I have a bigger vocabulary.  I don't care if you cuss around me. If there is a little kid around, watch your mouth. I learned how to cuss back in the fifth grade. Sermon over.

      I love music. I can't sing, but I can play the guitar. Music is the outlet of every emotion in my body. The music I like is metal/punk/ska rock bands. I can't really get behind rap or hip hop. Listening any kind of rock, I get psyched up for things. Now let us traverse to a different part of my mind. What do I like in girl? I like a girl to have interest in music, be funny, be supportive, and decent looking. I like to say that I'm modestly good-looking. Yeah, I look weak, but so what? I try to look tough, but I am actually really emotional and sensitive. I don't really show it at school. That's my problem I need to talk more. Easier said than done.

      Today I took a nap and when I woke up I thought it was tomorrow. So I took a shower. When I got out, it was still dark out. I went into my kitchen and checked the date on the computer. I took a shower for nothing. I am trying to let my hair grow shaggy, but as I understand I look better with short hair. My sister left for college the 19th. I miss her already. I am all by myself. No one to talk to. I have always been able to talk to her. I trust her a lot. I guess we are such great brothers and sisters because she had to talk for me when I was a little one. I can't really talk to my brother. He used to boss me and Molly around a lot. My brother, sister, and me all have middle names that start with L.  Last night, I dreamt that my room was breathing and it sucked me into a different universe. There I saw this old man who asked me why I was there. He then proceeded to chase me with his cane/sword. He catches me and takes me to his pirate ship. He ties me up. We float out to sea. There I see the world's past,present, and future. Then I was rescued by the Teletubbies and Spongebob. I ended up shooting the thought to be gay teletubby. I was spit out my walls. I landed in my bed and woke up.

      SNL wasn't all that great. I expected it to be really good. I thought they would have done something about the mob. Have you seen the previews for that new show called Kingpin. That looks good. Last night, I had my cousin over at my house. We played pool and watched tv. Then we played this game that consists of running around a pool table and throwing and catching a tennis ball. We watched a couple of movies and went to sleep. In the morning, We woke up and played some more games. Then we boxed. I am little sore. He hit me in sternum repeatedly. He also hit in the stomach, but I have strong abs. I think I did something to my finger. Between us, we drank 2 3/4 liters of mountain dew. I really should stop drinking that stuff, but I am addicted to it. I think I'll go to ymca today. After that, I'll probably watch Goodfellas. Anyone in T-ville want to go with me to the y? Ryan can't come because he has the flu. Last night, I watched Jackass. It was entertaining but stupid. See ya.

      Last weekend was fun one. Saturday, I went to a bowling party for 4-H. I sucked. Oh well. After that, I went to Greg's house. We played some video games. Sunday, I watched the Super Bowl at Joel's ,my youth group leader, house. It was an awesome time. I saw the ads for The Matrix: Reloaded, The Matrix: Revolutions, and Terminator 3. They look to be pretty promising. I placed a $5 dollar bet on the Raiders. Needless to say, they got their butts kicked. Near the end of the game, some of us got bored and started wrestling each other. I ended up wrestling Joel. It was a draw. Tennis conditioning will starting soon. I can't wait for it. I love to run. That night, I thought I had everything.But I don't have it all. The one thing I need is a girlfriend. I desperately need one.

      Death is inevitable. We all know it. Death has a plan for us all, but I'll tell you one thing. I'm not afaird of death. In some way, we all are afaird of it. I am but I am not. I heard once if something doesn't fear death, it is not alive. This isn't true. A man didn't die on a cross so we can be afaird. Death is not the end of all things. It is merely start of another. I am going to go all out next week. I am tired of being afaird of simple things like talking to that nice looking girl in the morning. I may or may not have plans for V-Day. It's in the works. What a weird blog. I went from death to love. Through God's love and Jesus's death, we are all saved, will be saved, and are being saved. So don't let fear,fate, and fatalities push you around.

      V-Day is coming up soon. Most likely, I won't do anything to impress the girl I like. Maybe I gather the guts to go up and talk to her. I wish I could get to know her more. I might buy some flowers or candy, but that wouldn't do at all. Two weeks ago, Bethany asked me, " If you could sum up all your courage to do something, what would it be?" My answer was to jump from a plane and parachute down into the Grand Canyon. This is just a matter of money. A better answer to that question would be: I would ask out the girl I like. Obviously, I am not going to tell you how this girl is, but some may know.

      I find that I can't stand to be alone anywhere. I find myself all alone in my house. With my sister in college, there is no one around to act stupid with it. No one to talk to but my parents. No one to help me on my projects that I procastinated on. No one to give me advice. I treasure each moment she is home. She told me that she gets lonely at college. Her boyfriend is in Marines Boot Camp. I hope I can get to see her soon.

      You know what body part is always beautiful?Guess what? You are using them right now. That's right. I find eyes beautiful. Have you actually look into your eyes through a mirror? I have blue eyes, but the shade of blue changes from time to time. Look at your eyes. Think of all the things you have seen with them. Think of the millions of blind people who haven't seen the beauty of the sunrise and the sunset. I really do believe every thing in life has beauty in it. That's everything of the opposite sex. Look around. We get to wake up and start a new day. See ya later.

      Sorry I haven't made an effort to make an entry. I have been busy lately.What with tennis conditioning, mid-terms, and Valentine's Day, I haven't been able to do much. Let's start with tennis conditioning. It's going great. At end of each session, I am tired and thirsty. During one session, a freshman made fun of me for always being out in the front while running. Needless to say, this kid was in the back. He also said it wasn't a race. Well, it is my friend. A race against myself. To push myself harder than others. I love running. Sometimes I grab energy out of nowhere. So that's tennis.         Valentine's Day was interesting. I did end up getting something for the girl I like in her locker. I gave two roses, a polar bear, and a card. I would thank a good friend for helping and being my partner-in-crime. I haven't heard from the girl I like. I suppose I will talk to her on Tuesday. Life is great. It seems when I take chances, I usually get butterflies in my stomach. Feb. 14, I had a stomach full of butterflies. I heard that she wasn't going to come school today because she didn't think she was going to get anything. I don't know if this is true( probably isn't). I really like this girl and I hope she likes me back. Well, this super hero has to go to sleep. "SuperSam, Away!"

      Lately, I have been on a awesome happy high.  Every day, I try to be positive.Yesterday, I talked to the girl I liked and found out she was interested in me. That put a damper on the day. I thought I would be able to burn up my frustration at tennis conditioning, but I was more sullen than angry. When I got home, I ran to my room and yelled at the top of my lungs. I wasn't angry the girl. I wasn't at myself. I decided I need some friendly voices. I called up a friend. He told me he was sorry. I have to say what I did for Valentine's Day was off the Sam's courage meter. For me, Talking to a girl I like is hard as hell. I would probably jump off a plane(with parachute) before talking to a girl I adore. I guess that is SuperSam's krytponite. Later, I called another friend. I thought she would like to know what had happened.She had helped me throughout it all. After I told her, she said she was sorry and proud of me for taking a giant step. That means a lot to me coming from someone who will go far in life. She is extremely smart. I would like to say thanks. And before this thing called High School is over, I would like to say it is a pleasure to know someone so caring and sweet. I going to wake up tomorrow. Guess what I am going to do? I am going to keep on living my life. Each day is a new day full of surprises and opportunities. If life serves you something hard, you hit back harder.... You know what everyone here in this small town or city called Taylorville has story to tell, a joke to laugh at, and a sadness to be mourned. Even though a whole bunch of them are stupid, it is good to know there are still superheros about in this enstranged world. Good night everybody. I think I try to get to sleep on time tonight. P.S. I got to see my sister yahhhh!!!!!!

      Hey everybody. I see a lot of new faces around the blogger community that I know. This is awesome. I'm sorry about the last entry. It was kind of depressing. Actual tennis practice will start soon. Yesterday, I went to the YMCA with Ryan. I found my SuperSam hat yesterday as well. I can't wait to be rid of this dreaded white stuff called snow. I WANT TO RIDE MY BIKE!!!! I am definitely going to move to a warmer state when I graduate. A couple of more years, I will be at a crossroad. Should I go to college? I haven't decided what I am going to be. I have dreams of being a BMX pro, but they probably won't turn out to be true. I am planning a summer bmx road trip with Ryan. Tomorrow is the last tennis conditioning session. I love to run. It's fun. Especially when you think you are going to cough out your lung. I don't know about you, but I wish this cold weather stuff would stop. I am thinking about starting a website about the illinois/t-ville bmx scene. I have to go start on a rough draft that is due tomorrow. See ya

      Hey everybody! I got to ride my bike a little today. I tried making a ramp out of ice. It kinda worked. Oh well. At least I got to ride. Friday, my cousin Morgan turned 15 (3 3/4). I had awesome time. I found out I can fit in a dryer, which is always useful information. I decided to forget the list. You cannot make a list of friends because you will always have new friends. After Morgan's birthday party, I felt that I had introduced my crazy ways to her friends. My cousin used to a little brat. She had one room for herself and another for toys. Her mother and father got divorced a long time ago.But eventually through hanging out with Molly and me, she became what she is today. A nice, weird little person. In a way, this world makes sense after all. I'm not perfect. Neither is or was anybody who walked this planet except Jesus. I may not be the smartest guy, but I try to live according to my standards. I am not the most muscular kid. I am not the popular kid. I am definitely not the greatest looking guy. I am the quiet and weird one. I am going to try not to be negative(mostly). See ya

      Man, I need to remind myself to blog. I got my new shoes. They are DC Ratios. They're colored Light Gray/ Red. They are awesome. They have a built-in mesh sockliner. I rode a lot today since it was a school improvement day. I found tons of stuff to ride. I ended up getting a flat tire. But did that stop me? NO. I went to the bank and got some cash. I bought a tire tube and some sunglasses at Wally World. I could find any tools to take off the bolts, so I went home. I fixed my bike and went back into town. I rode for a while. Then, I had to go to tennis practice. I had tons of fun (add sarcasm here). After practice, I rode some more. I found this pretty cool ledge to grind and manual on. Then I had to get home. I got home. I unloaded all my crap. Then, guess what I did next? I rode some more. I learned a couple tricks today, so needless to say I'm happy. Only thing, I am unhappy about is the poor state my bike is in. Me and Ryan are going to ride this weekend. It should be fun. Whenever Ryan and I ride together, it is always fun. I am trying to get a digital video camera. Oh so tired. I have to go and get some shuteye.

      Right now, I have two cousins that mean a lot to me. One is Morgan. She is funny and weird every little way. Then there is Brian. Lately, he has been over at my house a lot and he is welcome to come over anytime. His life must be crazy. I think he is great person that people think he is a druggie or something. Well guess what? He's not. He's like the little brother I never had. He is pretty cool. See ya

      Hola blog. I just got back from a lock-in. I didn't sleep at all. I don't feel like going to sleep right now. I want to ride a skatepark so much. The whole time I was at the ymca (where the lock-in was held), I felt like they should have skatepark. I don't know. Maybe that's just me. I want ride a skatepark so much. Riding street and dirt is fun, but I want to ride some ramps. This all may sound alien to everyone. oh well. good morning

      Today, I didn't ride that much. I was fixing my bike. I watched Road Fools 10( bmx road trip video). Needless to say, I wanted to ride my bike afterwards. I always want to ride after watching bmx videos. They get me so excited and pumped in a way unimaginable. My bike will soon be in great shape. Sometimes when I am riding, I ask myself," Where I am going with this bike?" It probably will take me to realm of great times. As the last nine weeks begins, I think wow. My friends and I will be leaving Taylorville in a few years. I am trying to get closer to other people. I don't know. I am just so confused right now. I like this girl so much, but I don't know if that interest is returned. I could go out on a limb and ask her out, but that may endanger our friendship. I just don't know. Buenos noches.

      I just got back from tennis practice. We got our rankings today. I am number 8 out of 9 people. This ,my friend, is bullshit. I got stuck behind someone who I know can beat him without a doubt. I will challenge him at the first chance I get and I will win. On a other note, Spencer pointed out to me that most of my blogs are about me riding bike. My life revolves around that bike. If my life centralized around something else, I'd type about that. I don't have a girlfriend. I have average intelligence. I really have nothing else to type about except that bike and the experiences on it. To you it seems to be a piece of metal. To me, it is more than that. It is an extension of my body. When I am away from it, I feel like a part of me is missing or I forgot something. When I am on or off it, I am always looking for stuff to ride. I love that bike. I know it sounds weird and impossible to love an inanimate metal object, but it's the one thing that keeps me sane sometimes.  This weekend I am going to find this halfpipe thing in t-ville. VanGeison out.

      Man, this class is noisy. I'm in computer concepts. I have tennis practice tonight. Rohan challenged me 2 days ago so I going to be tired tonight. I have a essay to write. I was asked to be in a video that Jesse is going to film. I am going to ride my bike. It should be awesome. It will mostly be street riding with a little ramp footage.

      Today at tennis practice, we had challenge matches. I was able to challenge Ted. It turned out to be pretty difficult, but in the end I won. I nearly killed myself a couple of times. We had to play 2 out of 3 sets. We had to go to the third set. I am so tired. As an added bonus, Brent can't play singles (because of his leg, not the good thing), I am number 6. Brent can only play doubles. That must suck. I feel sorry for him. I hate being injured.  On another note, I am currently becoming interested in making public skateparks in illinois bike-friendly. I contacted an official for a public skatepark in the Chicago area to see why they didn't allow bikes. Their reason:At this time we cannot let bikes in due to the ceiling height on the sides of the building. It doesn't allow enough clearance for the height that bikers get. This , my friend, is a bunch of shit. Even though the ceiling may be low, it doesn't mean bikes can't ride the park. Not letting bikes into public skateparks: this makes me very angry. It is discrimination against us bikers. There are over 7 million bike riders in the US alone. As one of them, I must free a skatepark from being biker non-friendly. Taxpayers' money make those "public" skateparks. While the skateboarders and the in-liners ride the park, us bmxers can only watch. I mean there is nothing more stupid than that. I guess since bike isn't in the word skatepark, they think bikes shouldn't be allowed. "Skatepark" has become a generic term for a ramp facility, just like Kleenex for facial tissues--it's is easy and simple to say. I am here to make a difference

      This time by next year, I will be so ready for summer. I am going to work my ass off this summer and save all that money. I am going to Camp Woodward next year!!! Camp Woodward is like a Mecca for bmxers. It is heaven on earth. I am so excited to start working that's scary. The cost of the camp alone is $945. It is in Pennslyvania. I know this sounds crazy but is worth it. For one week, I live in an air-conditioned cabin, riding skateparks, and learning new tricks. As a bonus, Camp Woodward doubles as a gymnastics camp. OOOHHH yeah. I may be going out on a limb here, but aren't 99.9% of gymnasts girls? At the camp, they have these foam pits. Foam cubes to be exact. And what you do is, you go off a roll-in, hit the ramp, try your trick, and land in the foam harmlessly. Once you think have the trick down, you try it one the resi box-jump. All a resi box-jump is, is a box-jump covered from the beginning and end of the ramp with a thick, slick, and soft plastic sheet. So if you crash, it doesn't hurt as much. I can't wait to go.

      It's been a while. I just got back from a tennis meet in Hillsboro. We won. The score was 6-3. I won my singles match easily because coach decided to make me play junior varsity. I lost at doubles just barely. During my singles match, some idiot kids decided to throw a big ass cup of soda at the courts. The Hillsboro guys get pissed and run up to talk to them. I think a couple of the kids ran away. It was rather funny. I have never seen that happen in a tennis match. Oh well. Rohan is going to challenge me tomorrow. I am going to win. I know that sounds cocky, it is the truth.  Ryan hit a '69 Mustang with his truck. He is pretty saddened by it. His truck is alright, but the Mustang isn't. In other Ryan news, he told me recently that once his bike breaks, he is going to stop riding bikes. This may not mean a lot to you, but it made me sad. This was the guy that I learned a bunnyhop with. I won't let him quit. Once he quits, I will be alone in the bmx community that is taylorville. I don't want that to happen.  Sammy P is blogging again. YAY  Bye.

      Regrets. We all have them. Whether you like it or not, we all have them. I have my own fair share. I regret standing to right of my left-handed cousin on that eerie December. I regret not speaking up when my voice was whisked away by shyness. I know all this must sound saddening, but oh well. One of my deepest regrets goes back to 8th grade. I know what you all are thinking." Oh no, not a trip down memory lane." It was summer. I was extremely happy. I was on top of the world. I was going out on a date. I had to walk from Arby's to the movie theater. No biggy. I get there on time. She arrives. We watch the movie. When we left the theater, we standing out on the corner of the Square. She had just gotten back from the Washington, D.C. trip. I missed her so much. She called me during that time. I was going to be leaving the next day for a canoeing trip. As we were standing there, I wanted to say something sweet to her. Something that would move her. Something that would say I love you and that I wanted a long lasting relationship. After that, I thought why not add in a kiss for good measure. But you know what? I didn't do any of those things and I am stupid for doing so. My shyness got the best of me.  Sometimes I wish that I was more socially outgoing as others. But this relationship lasted a good 3 months. I loved that girl. She knows who she is. I may add right now that this entry is not directed towards her but at me and my stupid shyness. I wish her a long lasting relationship with whomever she is going out with. I know someone down the line will me shit for this blog, so send your comments to bmxskateboardpunk@hotmail.com. I'm sorry if I depressed, angered, or hurt you guys in any emotional way. Trust me. I have seen and known pain,fear, and anger. I have lashed out, ran from things that scared me to death, and tasted my own blood. It is human nature to feel all these things. But do you know what is the best part of life? Waking up, living your life, and being who you are. I usually open up when I am out of school, because I feel like I'm being watched at school. It's crazy. I love nature. I love riding my bike and my bike in general. I don't how far this bike is going to take me and I don't how far I will take it. I do know it is going to be one hell of a ride.

      Hey. We lost our last two tennis matches and won today's. I won my game, so I'm happy. I'm not agreeing with the weather. It sucks. I keep on telling Spencer to blog and he just says " he has, but he has been pressing the post button. ha ha. I am so glad this is almost over. I had 3 tennis matches in a row this week. Talk about being tired. Oh well, I going to sleep bye

      First off, I have to say sorry if that last blog depressed you. Second, I'm again disappointed in myself for not blogging. This week I wrote a poem. I don't know. I'm not as poetic as Abe or Sammy, but I can try. Before I get started, I would like to say something. To all these people who think it is hilarious to make fun of bmx, STOP IT!! I know you all are joking, but how would you feel if I made fun of something important to you. It hurts. So stop it. I know someone will still do this. I can take a joke, yeah, but imagine me making fun of your grandma who you loved very much and she just passed away. on with the poem. The wind in my hair Reminding me that the time is near Fear of pain keeps me here Standing there in a stare Nothing is making a sound Except for the crickets on the ground Taking my time To think of something sublime I took a step I felt my heart skip Kept thinking Have to commit, have to commit Fear was sinking This was it Now or never The wind was at my back The sun was clever The trail was brown and black The people to the side were a blur I didn't really know how many there were Speeding past them all Knowing that I couldn't choke or stall Finally I neared the ramp It was made of clay and rather damp I pedaled like a madman the rest of the way No one knew what was at bay The final crank The hit of the bank I pulled upward with all my might Just for that glorious sight Above them all Even the tall Newton stopped it there Without a care I came back down Rolled away With minor sound I rolled away without a care The wind was in my hair.

      I don't how got sick. Thursday, I woke with a terrible cough. Today, it was still there. I also had a really painful headache. I didn't do much today. I basically just lounged around my house all day. I signed up for a job at Garwood's. This will be my first year ever working there. I expect to be very tan and tired by the end of summer. I am sort of sad that school is over. I never get to do much during summer vacations. Maybe this year will be different. My dreams have been invaded by The Matrix and girls. Most of the dreams about the girls are dreams of girls I would like to date. They're not perverted. What do these dreams mean? They mean it's time for me to get a girlfriend. I will tell you more about the matrix dreams later

      With school basically at an end, I sit here thinking where did it all go? I mean seems like yesterday when I was running about trying to find my classes freshmen year. Somehow I can't think of a reason why this year seemed so short. Oh well, summer is basically here. I am going to be working a lot this summer. I hope get out a little bit more than I did last year. I have been studying for semesters like everyone else and I decided to take a little break from el loco espanol libro(the crazy spanish book). I can't believe in like three months my dear friend and youth group leader will be proposing, I will be working like a madman, and I will be getting ready for my junior year. Next year, I plan on going to homegoing and prom, although I didn't go either. One because I couldn't and the other because I couldn't( or wouldn't) find a date. Oh well.

      So I've decided to try and be creative this summer. I have been trying write stories. Some stuff comes and goes.  About work, I have been working with my dad.It's bearable. About the dreams, I have lost them. It seems as soon as I wake up, I find myself chasing after the details and getting nothing. It seems most dreams are lost to the subconscious level. I spent a good hour trying to remember my dream, and I ended up falling asleep. It's a vicious cycle I tell you. About love interests, I'll say a few things. There are a couple of girls I would like to date in the near future. But I save that for another blog

      I have been writing some poems. They're not done yet. I don't where they came from.You know I'll post them on here. On another subject, I realized today that I haven't been on date in long time. I just want to go on one date with this girl I like. The probelm is that I don't see her all that much. I don't know. I need to get out of this house more often. I am going to try and get to the bowling alley next week. Adios

      Let me start off with the canoeing trip. The trip was awesome. I got to hang out with a lot of cool people. I had the chance to soak in the beauty of nature and how it sometimes is overlooked. How everything seems so simple when you are surrounded by trees, water, and rocks. Where it no longer matters who has the fastest car or hottest girl. A place in which you can find yourself spiritually. Nothing more enlightening. Only bad part about the enlightment is that I got stiff shoulders and sunburn, too. I listened to a lot of rap on the trip. I sort of got hooked to rap. I also bottomed out a lot. The river was supposed to be high. At the end of canoeing part of the part, my feet were so glad for solid ground.  Just the feeling of my bare feet on cold, moist sand was great. I basically ate junk food for three days. I got from the trip somewhere around 9 or 10. I took a nap as soon as I got home. I woke up and then just went back to sleep. I woke up again and rode my bike for a while. I sat down and tried to think of something to do and here I am. On the 3rd, I spoke about love interests. I think I'll just come out and say it. I'm not all that great when it comes to speaking of love. Do I have at least one love interest? Yes, I do have one and no, you can't know how it is. That would spoil my fun, now wouldn't it? It's been a long time since I have been in a relationship. I wish I was in right now, but of course my shyness gets me everytime. I don't know anymore. I think I need a girlfriend badly. I need some sleep, good night.

      Today was okay. I woke up at 9, went back to sleep, and woke up again at 12. I had to set up this mini-golf course at the stonington summerfest. After that, I pretty much did nothing. I remember when the summerfest was awesome and really fun, but now it sort of sucks. It used have really good rides and awesome food. Now we're stuck with these shitty rides and ok food. Today I worked at a ring toss. I thought I was going to throttle my two little cousins. Don't get me wrong, they're just plain annoying. I worked 2 hours there and got a souvenir headache. I also got a superman necklace with fake diamonds. I got it because one of my nicknames is supersam. Well tomorrow I'm working at a mini-golf course at the summerfest twice.12-2 and 8-10. If you have nothing to do, swing by.  I am starting at my new job monday. I'm working garwood seed co. in stonington. This will be my first year there...so hopefully I won't screw up too much. My dream last night was weird. I was hobbit with a blond mullet. I lived in the village of bullwax. I was carpenter, I think. Everybody kept on calling Hertz VanWinkle. Everybody in the whole town didn't like my handiwork. Then this ugly hobbit named Struedel streaked past my shop window twice. and somehow I went to the jail for it. I just don't know I can't believe, but I've got this serious crush on this girl I've been talking about. I don't know what it is about her, but I just really like her. I can't her out of my head. Oh well I'd better go.

      I made a collage today. I like it and so does my sister. That's pretty cool coming from awesome artistic person as herself. I told some people that I haven't got my poems done yet. I lied.  it seems people don't understand what life is really about sometimes you to take a stand not taking the easy way out that you don't run when shit gets scary you say there and in sight even if you escape with your life barely it doesn't matter if you win the fight things will blow up in your face maybe it is not your fault if that is the case You should take advice with a grain of salt  there it is. I have another one coming so...hold on  who am i? i am a guy with not many issuses so spare the tissues i haven't been through been thin and thick some people make me sick they think they can pull wool over my eyes but they don't realize that i'm the one in disguise i sit here in silence choosing not to take part in the violence i try so hard to not lash out people really don't what i'm about not to get lyrical i'm only here to be literal sitting here for a long time watching this crime watching these two kids go at each other because one kid said something about the other's brother what exactly the use?  the brother gives him nothing but abuse so what's the point of it if they don't really give a shit they need to get rid of that pinned up rage before the government sends straight them to the cage they need to rethink their lives drop the guns, blades, and knives instead of getting into fights and brawls they need some time in those study halls to set them straight and make something of their life so buddy it's ok now you can drop the knife i know what's going on here i have been watching for near a damn year i have been sitting on my ass just seeing how long this would last so go now and get in your car you've taken this way too far as for you, there's nothing wrong with a little push and shove but when you start thinking about getting a glove to keep your fingerprints on off that nine that's one big sign that you should drop the gun,blade, and knife make something special of your life   i have no idea where this came from goodnight or good day

      I was thinking today " Wouldn't it be cool to have a twin?" I mean somebody that just thought the same as you. I always thought that would be cool. I don't know if I would get tired and annoyed with him. Probably not. It seems that my brother is pissed off every time I see him these last couple of days. I don't know what's wrong with him. He asked me a question and I simply answered with no sarcasm at all 'I don't know.' And I get a ' Don't back talk to me or I'll bloody your nose.' Beats me.

      Today I went bowling twice. Once during the day by myself at north lanes and another time at night with my cousins at old bowl. I have to say this... I SUCK AT BOWLING. I really need to improve my form. I don't even think I broke 100. So if I play anyone from the bowling team, I'm screwed. By the end of the night, I was just screwing around. I tried bowling with my left hand and did two under-the-leg shots. It was pretty cool. Most of the time I bowl, I get spares and strikes first five frames and then suck for the rest of the frames. Maybe it's a matter of concentration. I think I'm going to go bowling on a weekly basis.  Well I'm really hyper so I going to go work out. Good Night Ya'll.

               I tried posting last night, but this new blogger version is pretty weird. My dream last night was pretty weird as well. I was a federal agent investigating a gang of illegal sock makers. I don't know how socks could be illegal. Anyways, I was driving down a highway and I get pulled over by a police officer. She tells me that I'm in direct violation of fine butt law. So I get arrested and sent to jail to await my trial. During my trial, all my lawyer was doing was defending my ass. I ended winning the case. Then I met this Spanish family named the Smiths and the rest of my dream was spoken in Spanish. So I had no clue what was being said.         Work is so easy. I think one-eyed monkey could do great at this job. It's not all that complicated. In three days of work, I've made near $131. I haven't got sunburnt badly because I use spf 50 sunblock. By the end of the summer, I'm going to look like an indian.        Last night I spend a good deal of time trying to figure out what I do for a career. I'm thinking about being a massage therapist or a physical therapist. People have always told me that I'm really good at giving backrubs, so I'm going to try and pursue this.  It is pretty complicated. You have to take a lot of anatomy classes. Oh well, until then I still being giving out backrubs for free. I don't even remember when I started give people backrubs. Couple of people say I have a gift. Hey, maybe this is my calling. I don't know. I've been thinking about it a lot. Physical therapist get paid a good deal of money. So if you have sore shoulders, give me a call. I might be able to do something about.

      What's up with rascist people? I can't think of a worst way to spend your life. You basically spend it being pissed off at something that doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter what race you are. It all depends if you are a good person. You think blaming your problems on someone else is going to help? It hasn't before, so why will it now? I can't wait to get my first paycheck. I need to go buy some new clothes. Badly. I also need some new shoes. My work shoes are pretty dirty. I need to get to the gym. I also need a girlfriend. I know some people may not think so, but I need someone. I don't know. I know this blog has been short, but I will write a long one during the weekend. I promise

      Today I started work at garwood's. It's pretty easy, but it's also boring. All you have to do is walk up and down the field and cut down taller than usual corn. I get paid 6.25 per hour and my lunch hour is from 11:15 to 1:00 so it's pretty good. Basically I'm getting to get some exercise and a tan. I don't know. I was planning on using the money I earn this summer to do some stuff to my car, but I don't think I want to spend my money on something that can easily be destroyed. I am thinking about going to camp woodward on my money. Memories aren't as near vulnerable as a car.

      So I sit here wondering what to do. Do I take the plunge or do I back away in fear from it? Sooner or later I'll figure this out, but as of now I don't know what to do.  I could, but there are the consequences for it. But aren't consequences for everything you say and do? So provided that should I just do it? Yes there could be loss or there could be gain. If I back away does that make me coward or does it mean that i'm interested something else? I don't want to back down, but what if I'm forced to? What then? Do I just walk away or fight for it? Walking away would do nothing for me at all except humiliate me. It would only show that I didn't want it that bad, which I do want this to happen. I'm sick of being shot down, so I can only hope that I'm not. If I fight for this, who knows, I might just get it. I mean I can do it if my mind and heart are in the right place. I want this to happen so bad that I think about when the boredom kicks in. I think ' Wouldn't it be great if that were to happen?' This means so much to me and if I was blessed to have this happen to me, I would be the happiest person alive.  So here's what I'm left with: Walk away from this or just take the plunge.  Each choice has its own advantages and disadvantages. So those are the options? I can take them or leave them. Ah, to choose, to choose, which one to choose. So much to gain and so much to lose....I think I'll take the way that's logical to me and I'll just take this plunge and see what happens.  If you wandering why this blog was so vague, there are two reasons. One: this is an idea. An idea that you can all refer to. Two: Vagueness is fun.

      Well as I sat here for 15 minutes, I got tired of this stupid line staying in the upper left hand corner of the page. So I decided it's time to move it around a little.  Someone wanted me to blog about my feelings, but I don't think there is enough words to describe my feelings. I do have feelings. For some reason, some people think I'm cold hearted or some like that. Just because I don't speak. I'm shy. I only really open to someone if I know them well. That's my only issue. Being shy is somehow a good thing because I don't really go around blabbing what I think about stuff. Sometimes, people will be saying stuff and it blows up in their face.  My shyness does give the advantage and disadvantage of being innocent looking. I may look innocent, but I sometimes don't act the part.  Lately I've been staying up too late and sleeping in till noon. It's not all that healthy. Today I noticed that I drink the most water in my family. When they're drinking little cups of water, I usually have this big mug of cold water. Lately I've cutting down on the mountain dew. I've been trying to keep from getting break outs. I've been trying to keep myself in decent shape. I started working out again on a daily basis so that's good. Tomorrow I go back to work, I can't wait because it gets boring sometimes in this house. Oh well, I still can't believe how much I like this girl. And no, it's not who you think. Well this is it for me. I have to go now. buenos noches

      Why do I act so stupid at times? You would think that I'd have gained some knowledge down this road called life. But, no, I don't know think at times and stuff blows up in my face. The stuff I've done has only pushed this dream away. I mean I like this girl a lot and if I could sit down and actually talk to her about it, instead of getting no answers. I want this to work out, but my actions aren't helping a lot. So maybe i should just think once in a while. I mean this isn't a good way to get her attention. I'm just driving her away with that stupid thinking. I have to tell her that I am stupid sometimes. I don't know. It seems I should tell her that I'm really serious about liking her and that I'm not fooling around. She knows I like her but I don't know what she thinks of me. Or whether she even likes me. I may never get an answer and that fact only makes me more curious.  So there it is.  Good Night everybody

      Why it is that when I sit here in this place, I come with no ideas to write about. I sit here in this shop because my dad has finally moved his office out to his shop. By doing so, he has moved the computer out with him. I look around and what's there? Tons of empty cigarette packs and millions more sucked dried beer cans. and it. What's it, you ask? The stupid thing that might allow me to go to college. It sits there looking nice, sleek, and attractive. I do agree it is all of those things, but I look at and see nothing. I mean this thing is worth at least $50,000. What's this thing? A red Ford Thunderbird. I mean all of my life money has been spent on his addictions and cravings. I mean I could be rich off the money he's spent on beer and cigarettes. The man's basically paying for his quickened death.  What makes me even sicker is that I don't do anything to stop him.  I don't know. I wish he would stop. I really do.

      I should have stayed in bed today. I asked my mom to cash my paycheck, all of it. Obviously, she didn't want me to do this, but I told to do it anyways. I mean I asked as nicely as I could and she got angry. I left for work. We went a field and finished it. Then we went another one and two kids decided to throw tassels at me. Ok, I'll tell you now, I don't just take shit like that and do nothing about it. I start throwing back. I wasn't really good at baseball so I couldn't hit them all that well. I got a couple of good hits, but they got me so many times in the face. So by now, I'm pissed. One of them says he'd wrestle me if I was up to, he said he doubted I was. If you know me, I'd go into a wrestling match even if I knew I'd lose. But my anger got the best of me. I agreed. So anyways I lost. It's not a good idea to wrestle someone who lifts weights every day. I got body slammed about three times. By body slam I mean being grabbed around the waist, picked up, be put on their shoulder, and slammed on the ground. Each time I got higher in the air and by the third one I was upside down. As soon I hit the ground, I knew I was done. I was pinned. I pushed him off me, because I knew I had to get up. Some people said they would have just laid there for a minute. But I had to get up because he knocked the all of the wind out of me. I had hard time breathing for a couple of minutes. Now I have this thing under my left eye. oh well. I actually am still talking to him because I realized how stupid I was. Well anyways the rest of the work day was great. So I have to take someone home, that's ok. I took this kid home. On my way back, this kid, who early almost got hit me because he took up the whole road and didn't move to his side. Well anyways, I was driving up a hill, very much on my side of the road. This kid comes over the hill and he's in the middle of the road, again. I'm sorry, but I had to ride the ditch because this idiot wouldn't get over. I mean that's stupid. If I had not been paying attention, he would have hit me. It pisses me off so much because when you're driving up a hill, you stay on your side. I don't care if it's in the country. He should have consideration for people's lives. I mean someday this kid is going to kill somebody just because he's too stupid to figure out that he needs to be on the right side of the road. So I go home and take a shower. I get a call from someone saying i should go riding around. Now me being the idiot I am thought she meant taylorville. I get to t-ville and I'm supposed to be stonington. I meet her at wal-mart. So anyways, we go driving around in her new car with some of her friends. I had pretty good time. I would like to thank that person for having me. Because that was probably the best part of my day. While we were riding around, my mpm called me and asked me what I was doing, and where I was at. So I have to leave to go pick up my cousin and I got there. I called home to tell my parents I was going bowling. My dad told me to be home at eleven. OK. So me and my cousins were about to leave and my mom calls me. She starts bitching at me and tells me to come home immediately. So here I am on my bitch box a.k.a blog. I'm done. Tomorrow is going to be better just because it's not today.

      So yes, today was rather good. Just a little hot, but good. It was just so tranquil. I worked today, but somehow it seemed still and quiet. Nothing really happened. Just a regular day at work. I can't wait for it to be over though. Every time I close my eyes, I see corn and feel like I'm still on the rig. Kind of like, after you ridden a lot of roller coasters, you still feel like you're on one. Very strange. I doesn't matter though. It will soon be over. My paychecks are always a decent amount. I'm thinking about getting a job when school starts. Ah, the Stonington Steak Dinner is this weekend. I can't believe it. Where did summer go? Oh well. There's still the state fair and the x-games. By x-games time, it will be a couple of days until school starts. Right now, I'm ready for school. well i need to get to bed. more later...cya

      As it rains lightly and Mr. Osbourne provides some background music, I reflect on Tuesday. What an awesome day. That's an understatement, really. Tuesday, Austin Phelps and I headed up to this skatepark in Decatur. The drive there went nice and smooth. We got to Decatur and we couldn't find the park. We took to driving around trying to find it. We're definitely not in the ghetto. With huge houses and fancy cars up and down the neighborhood, I was easily calmed. We found the entrance to the park in which the skatepark is located. We arrived exactly at 12:30. There were already people riding there. Maybe 7 or 10. A few of them were really great. The skatepark was pretty simple. All in all, it was an awesome experience. I mean I tried some pretty sweet stuff. Austin did pretty good himself. He also got some battle wounds. We didn't get ourselves into trouble. However, a fight almost broke out between these little kids. It was really funny. I didn't really care. I was too busy riding. Nothing really happened. One kid and all of his friends left. The other stayed there. Austin's dad came and picked him up. I don't remember the exact time when Austin left , but I do know that I left at 5:30. So let's tally this up. I rode from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 pm with no real breaks in the scorching heat. For what you ask? For fun, my friend, for fun. I guess I must be crazy. I got home with ease. I ate a feast once I stepped near my refrigerator. After I ate, I took a nice long bath. Usually I take showers, but today I was too sore, stiff, sweaty, and tired to do so. After my bath, I took a hour long nap. I went into Taylorville and hung out. Came home and fell asleep at 3 a.m. I woke up today 1 p.m. My sleeping pattern is so messed up right now. Oh well, I'll fix it later. Right now, I'm happy. All because of a little bike. Funny, eh? We are so easily pleased sometimes, humans in general. I mean give us something we love to death and we will be happy. Whether it be riding bike or pretending to bums, it's all good. And in the words of mister osbourne from his song Diary of A MadMan: Screaming at the window  Watch me die another day  Hopeless situation endless price I have to pay  Sanity now it's beyond me there's no choice  Diary of a madman  Walk the line again today  Entries of confusion  Dear diary I'm here to stay.  Manic depression befriends me  Hear his voice  Sanity now it's beyond me  There's no choice.  A sickened mind and spirit  The mirror tells me lies  Could I mistake myself for someone  Who lives behind my eyes  Will he escape my soul  Or will he live in me  Is he tryin' to get out or tryin' to enter me.  Voices in the darkness  Scream away my mental health  Can I ask a question  To help me save me from myself  Enemies fill up the pages  Are they me  Monday till sunday in stages   This is an awesome song. I would definitely recommend you download this song. It is time for this madman to sleep. Night

      Well I'm back on my bike, so I'm happy. All summer, I was pissed off at myself for not riding. Too busy working. But now I'm back on it. Funny how a little bike can make me content. I don't expect many people to understand this. It's like an addiction for me. I have to ride every day for at least a couple of hours. I have been hurt from riding, but does that keep me from riding? No. I live for it. Just pushing on those pedals brings me some satisfaction. Today I rode with a kid who just started riding. Jeez, riding with him brought home to me that it was hard for me to learn all the stuff I had. I had no one to tell me what to do. It was all me. Just me. I also found that I must look at stuff differently than everybody else. I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just crazy. It seems that way sometimes.

      I've said this before and I say it again. I'm not all that great at poetry. So this is really just an attempt.   blood and sweat  i know them well they haven't abandoned me yet i kind of smell i've known them for days on end bruises, scrapes, and such to my family, it isn't much i ride to live i live to ride anything i would give to be outside right now as i write to stay right here takes all of my might it takes shape in my head every second of the day it doesn't matter what is said i won't give up whatever you say blood runs through the newborn cuts strange seem those who are off the wall or out of the box bystanders thinking, 'This guy has to be nuts!' i don't really live to see you knocked out of your socks i live for the moment when you see me for what i am a kid with his blond head bent that will always be supersam  i don't know, i really don't know

      Today I basically just have been a bum. I haven't really done anything and I don't feel like doing anything. I'm tired and my ears are hot. I don't really want to go to bed. On a side note, any energy supplement drink only takes the energy from the near future. I've been thinking lately and I want to be a relationship with a girl so bad that I'm going about it the wrong way. I try to force myself into one and that isn't right. I can't really commit. So I guess I'm just going to wait and let things be natural. Sooner or later, a girl will catch my eye. I'm out

      Well, well, well. I'm back. It is hard to keep this up. School is going awesome. Somehow I must have been hypnotized because I'm reading three books at once. Two for school and one for myself. Oh well. Tonight was pretty fun. I hung out with Heather, Erica, and some other kids. During this time I kind of acted like a monkey. I was climbing stuff and I really can't remember why.  Then I got see the football team lose. That was actually the first time I've been to a game in my whole entire high school days. Then I dropped some kid at his house. I called Ryan, Gregg was with him, and he said he had a story to tell me.  I hooked up with them 10 minutes after that. I met them at Gregg's house.  When Ryan gets out of his truck, he's wearing all black and has a Jason mask in his hand. I looked at him and just asked what have you two been up to.  Two mischievous grins popped on their faces. I'll leave the actual story-telling up to Ryan. So me, Gregg, and Ryan went out to the park and met up with a lot of people. It was pretty awesome. I will try to blog more often. I'll end this entry with a serious question for you people: What exactly is at the end of the Yellow Brick Road?

      School sucks. Right now I'm not all that fond of it. I got a midterm for Spanish. I was getting a F. Talk about a wake-up call. Yeah. If I had it my way, I'd just drop it at the end of the semester.  But, no, I have to stick with it and bust my ass over it. So yeah. On a happier note, my birthday is in 35 days. I know it is a month away, but still I'll be 17 years old soon. Scary, eh? I want a computer of my own because this one sucks. One of the drives doesn't work at all and the other works from time to time. Oh well. I don't have much more to say right now.

      So yeah, I'm no longer failing Spanish. In fact, I think I'm getting a B-. How did I go from a F to B-? I don't know and I don't care. As long I'm not failing, I'm satisified. That and with my birthday 24 days away, life is good. Check that. Life is freakin awesome again. This weekend has been a really nice vacation for me really. I kind of lost track of the days. But alas I have homework. I have to read some chapters in this book and I have to write an essay. Oh well. That's tomorrow. Or today really in a couple of minutes. So good night or good day.

      Let's see. What to say, what to say?  I'm going to be an uncle. My brother and his wife are having a baby. How cool is that? Uncle Sam, eh? I think it's so awesome. A little kid with the similar DNA makeup running around in a year. It's not confirmed by a doctor, but they are pretty sure. Unbelievable, eh? I'm so happy for them both.  Ok, so I was reading for Modern Novels and at the moment it was really boring. But anyways my mom walks in and tells me that my sister is engaged. Naturally, I couldn't read for like 20 minutes because I was like completely blown away with happiness for my sister. They are getting married after she finishes college. If you read this, Molly, Congrats!!   Report cards came out today. I think I did well. I'm not failing anything. That's a good thing, eh? My mom didn't really say anything so I guess I'm good. Couple that with the fact my birthday is 14 days away, I'm happy.  I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.  There is one thing I have to do make it even better. And I trust me I will do it. Well I guess I'd better be off to bed.

      My birthday was today. Even though I didn't get much for presents, it rocked. I had originally planned to skip the whole day to go see The Matrix: Revolutions. I didn't skip and I'm glad I didn't. I had no homework, basically. I got my modern novels reading done during school. So yeah, I ended up going to see the Matrix after all. I went with my cousin, Morgan. It was awesome. The theater was actually not packed. Kickass movie. Now that I'm 17, I don't know if I feel older. I don't mean for this blog to be long. I only mean it to be me. I remember starting this thing a long time ago. I was just trying to find some outlet to vent my frustrations, bury my fears, and pour out my aspirations and thoughts. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this thing called a blog. I can't think of what I'd do without it. Last but most definitely not least, back in August, I said a girl would catch my eye sooner or later. Well, guess what? One did. I asked Meg out on Sunday and right now that's best thing I've got going. I've liked her for a long time. It was back at homecoming when it happened. She's so cute and sweet. Those words don't even suffice. I don't know. I'm not really good about expressing my emotions and feelings in person. I felt so bad because I took so long of a time to ask her out. I found out she thought I didn't like her at all from someone Saturday. That's completely opposite of what I feel for her. I like her so much. Whenever, I'm having a bad day, seeing her just makes me happy. Just now I had this urge to go back and delete all that because fear of what people may think, but I'm not going to. This is how I feel. Plain and simple.

      Warning: This is a long blog. Be prepared. Strap in. Make sure you have food near by. You are in for long read.    Days have gone by Time has always told Infant trees cry  Their parents cut and sold They weep for their own Leaves glistening gold New seeds will be sown But still they shed their tears Gone is all they have known On and on, grow their fears Of dry and dismal days Only when saplings come of age Do the trees spirits raise And the elder trees calm their rage They drop their leaf and fruit A relief from stress and burden The young trees follow suit Although they are not quite certain But still they shed their solemn tears As an open act of remembrance A custom for upcoming years  That trees have been following since They are doing it now even as I write Every tree, small to tall, one and all Practicing their ceremonial rite Thus came about the season of fall  Wow, I remember starting this poem like 2 months ago or maybe even more. And I never thought of way to end it. I was sitting at my computer and I had an epiphany. I was like that makes absolute sense, at least to me anyways.   Follow your dreams, folks. What I mean is you may be still here tomorrow, but your dreams may not. If you follow them with full faith and ambition, you can fulfill them. You know the little saying at the top of this blog, well a long time ago, I had a dream. A man in this dream told me this. The ironic thing is that I woke up at the word dreams. As soon as I woke up, I remembered those exact words and wrote them down. I don't know why. Maybe it was on impulse or maybe it was on purpose. Maybe my brain was say 'Hey buddy, write this down and remember it.' That at a subconscious level, I knew that if I sat down and thought about it for while, I would find the real meaning. And I did. It is simply this, folks. Where there is faith and a will, there is most definitely a way. That in fact, the only boundaries, limits, or rules that obstruct you are the ones that you make yourself. In essence, 'you must free your mind' , to quote Morpheus from The Matrix. I know if Ryan reads this, he'll laugh. After watching the first Matrix, I kind of quoted it a lot.  That was long time ago, too.   NO, this isn't over.  I read this book called the five people you meet in heaven. I think it was 196 pages long. Good book. Really good book. I think I read in the course of three days. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It taught me a couple of things. One of those lessons was there is reason for everything that happens in your life. That there is purpose to every little thing.  Whoa, look at the time. Jeez. Well, folks, I'm tired. I do believe this will suffice for the 18 days that I didn't blog. But who cares. Like with wine, the more time you give something to brew, the better it is. It seems that my epiphany has subsided, like a storm upon the sea. I told you it was going to be a long read. You thought I was kidding, eh? No, my friend. I wasn't. Until my next time, farewell.

      You make me smile  You make me laugh You give me the warmest heart attack "The Warmest Heart Attack"--by Gameface  I remember when I first heard this song, I liked it because it was an awesome song, but now I like it even more. I listen to it for the first time in a long time and I was like,"Whoa, this is how I feel exactly right now." I know it sounds mushy, but my feelings are my feelings, right? Right. Yesterday was 5 weeks for Meg and me. Saturday we got together for a little while. Today, she said she wasn't feeling all that great. If you read this, I hope you feeling better.

      This week was torture for me. My schedule has been crazy. I no longer have lunch with Meg, or the rest of the table. I mean the table I sit at now is great. All the guys. But there's something missing. Every lunch in the first semester was just kickass because it was so god damn funny. The level of weirdness at that table just plain blew my mind. I don't know about this new lunch setting. It's different.   Not getting to see Meg much this week drove me insane. I saw her once or twice a day. That kept me borderline sane. Last night was awesome. Just being with her, threw all my worries to side and helped me have some fun. So yeah, last night was great. I'm incredibly happy.  But this schedule change has taught me something. It has taught me to value every little second I spend with Meg. And I do.  Creative writing is actually pretty fun. I always have wanted to write in class and having write about something every day is actually helping my writing I think. I have strong feeling that Mr. Schmitz forgot send in my poem to that contest. Oh well. Mrs. Rogers told me that will be a contest in the spring. I'm quite sure to say whether I'll be writing less or more because of creative writing. I think I might be writing more, though. I learnt that to be a successful writer one must have self-definition. I find it hard to write about myself without sounding conceited, but can someone go through life without knowing who he or she was or who his friends and family were? I could ask people to define me, but then that wouldn't be self-definition, would it?  If there had to be a Webster's definition for me, it would go something like this. Sam Van Geison: a really shy, slow to trust, quick to anger, cautious, loving, caring, sweet, funny, weird, quirky, simple yet complex, modest and humble, forgetful, passionate, energetic, fidgety and just a nice guy.  I know that seemed rather conceited of me, but most of the time I just describe myself as a plain guy. That I am not. Now, my friends, I will end this entry with the first three words from my first entry that was a year ago.  I am Sam.

                                              The Story of Meg and Me  Have you ever met someone and this feeling comes up? That instantaneous liking of the person. I really met Meg back at the start of school in lunch. Yeah, of course I knew who she was, but I really didn't know too much about her. Through the course of school and out of school, I got to know Meg better and she got to know me.  If there was a certain event that sealed the deal of my liking of Meg, it would definitely be Homecoming. I remember thinking that I wasn't going to go because I didn't have a date, but on the eve of Homecoming something changed my mind. Whatever it was, I'm glad it happened.   Homecoming was awesome, even though I had Pizza Hut for dinner, I have to say now that it ruled. I went with Heather, Erica, and Kelly, but I knew I wanted to find Ryan, Gregg, Bethany, and everyone else. I found them, and I was content. When Meg asked me to dance with her, I was more than happy to do so. I had a great time with her. Probably one of the most memorable nights of my life. When she left early, I remember being a little saddened. She said she'd be at Spencer's party. Since I was given an anytime curfew, I went there really to just see her. I mean I went there to see everyone else but she was on my mind the most.  I think that was the first time I had been at Spencer's. Probably the most memorable ever, too. I had a great time. I remember thinking about that is unbelievable how beautiful Meg looked, how nice and sweet she was, and how funny and quirky she was. Damn. She still is beautiful and cute, nice and sweet, and funny and quirky. When Spencer finally kicked the rest of us out, it was 2 am. I had my dress shoes on because I forgot to bring some regular shoes. Me and Meg said our good nights and she got in her car. I don't know what came over me, but as she started driving away I found myself running after her in my leather shoes. Now, it's not that easy to run in leather dress shoes because they don't bend like sneakers do. I remember her speeding up and turning a corner. I remember walking back to my car, getting in, and thinking,"Wow, that girl is great."  I slept more peacefully that night than I think I ever have. When I woke the next morning and went downstairs for breakfast, my parents asked about the night before. For a minute, I sat there, staring off into space. Then I looked at them and said, "It was fine." I smiled afterwards and thought "fine" is not really the adequate word for last night, numbskull. Blissful and perfect would be more exact. That night sealed the deal of my liking of Meg more than a friend.  I think it might have been a week or more later when Spencer pulled me aside in Consumer Ed class. He told me that Meg liked me and wanted me to ask her out. Spencer wanted to know what I thought and I told him to let me think about it. I had already been thinking about it. Thinking about it since the morning after homecoming. I knew I wanted to, but I'm shy guy, you see. Later on that week, I went and hung out with the group for the 2nd time. I think it was Andy, me, Gregg, Spencer, Bethany, Valerie, and Brittan. I'm pretty sure we rented and watched the movie "Orgazmo". Very funny movie by the way. I would definitely recommend you rent it. Anyways, while we were watching the movie, Bethany turned to me and asked me about what I thought about Meg liking me. I merely said I like it the idea. Even though I liked her a lot. For me, it's hard to ask a girl out. I mean really hard. Over the weeks, Spencer, Bethany, and Brittan were always asking me when I was going to ask Meg out. I told them before my birthday.    On the night of Elizabeth's Halloween Party, I went over to Meg's first. We talked for a while, then we watched Chicago. I wasn't feeling all that well. I completely destroyed a box of tissues. During the last period of the movie, Spencer called me asking where I was. I was supposed to be at Elizabeth's for the party, but I was having fun just being with Meg. When I left I thanked Meg for having me over, and putting up with me being sick. We hugged twice and I said good night. Had I not been sick I would have asked Meg out then and there, but I felt too miserable that night.   When I got over to Elizabeth's, the party was pretty much winding down. Niki, Elizabeth, and Spencer were on the stairs to the basement when I walked in. They asked me what me and Meg did. They joked and jeered with me a little, but I didn't really care. I just got to spend time with the girl I liked. Sick as a dog and as happy as a cat in a garden of catnip I was. Ironically, Sammy P. was there and she was sick as well." Two Sam's sick in same room is a bad thing," I thought. After a while, they gave me some drugs and I went home.  My birthday was coming up quick and I still hadn't asked Meg out." I'd better do this or I'm never going to do it at all." I thought. So on November 2nd, 2003, around 9:30 pm, I gathered my wits and my courage about me and dialed Meg's number. My stomach was instantly filled with butterflies. When she answered, I was almost about to hang up and forget, but I held on. I just small talked with her for a while. Then I just said," Meg, I really like you and I was wondering...if you would like to go out with me." I don't remember if these were my exact words or not, but after she said Of course, yes, yes, I remember being the happiest I'd ever been or could remember.   So 2 months and 2 days ago, I asked Meg out. It seems both like yesterday and years ago. One thing is certain, though. The amount of how much I like and trust Meg hasn't diminished. It has done the very opposite. It has grown. It has grown past the word "like." I have been in a couple of relationships before, but not one like this. Where there are days I can't stop thinking about her. From dawn to dusk, she is always on my mind For Christmas, I got her some things. I already gave her one of presents. It was my poem Days Have Gone By except I made the paper look old and bought a nice frame. What else I got her, you ask? I can't tell you that. It would ruin the surprise.   P.S. Don't forget to come back and read my other post below this one. I just woke up at 5:30 and had to type this. I'm done reminiscing for now. Well I got to go and watch Spiderman now.

      Massage therapy is the most natural medicine known to mankind. Think about it. You hit your elbow on something, what do you do besides cuss up a storm? You rub your elbow. You ate too much, what do you do? Rub your stomach. It's quite natural.  Along with Val, I, too, want to become a massage therapist. I haven't thought about what college I want to go to, but then again I haven't really concluded if I want to be a massage therapist or not. It's definitely something I'm good at. It's really quite easy and natural for me to do. Plus, I enjoy doing it. It makes me feel like I'm helping somebody in a way. And the pay is quite great. Let me see, I like doing it and it pays very well. I think a wise man once said Choose a job you like and you will never have to work a day of your life.  I was talking with Val about it and she asked me where would I like to work? I definitely wouldn't like to work in a spa. When you work for a spa, your rate of pay is decided by the spa and not by you. In a private practice, however, you set your rate. I have considered working in a hospital for physical therapy. I would like to be able to set people back on their feet after an accident. I remember when I was little kid and tried in vain to save one of my favorite cat's life. But when you're a kid, you don't quite understand everything. Hell, I'm 17 years old and I don't understand much. Well, my mom took my poor cat to the vet. I didn't go with her. When she came home, she came home without him. I asked her where he was, and she just said" Sam, Rashad (my cat, interesting name for cat) had a broken spine. That's why he couldn't walk right. He probably got ran over. He was lucky to still be alive, but now Rashad is a better place, Sam." I remember that day. I remember that I bawled till I became dehydrated. I had tried with all my might to get that cat back on its feet. If I can get some people back on their feet and into their normal way of life, I would be more than pleased to do so.   I hear I am good at massage and I guess I must be. Every time I give someone a massage or a backrub, I feel as if some energy from my fingertips is flowing into that person. That I have, in fact, hands of healing. I can get rid of people's ailments and stress just by touch. That fact in itself makes me feel great. I haven't much practice lately. If you would like me to practice on you, contact me.

      Hmmm. Why did I change this? I don't I felt like it needed to be. I'm sorru that comments aren't up. Britt will have them working in no time. I'm also sorry that I lost the comments of the last couple of entries, that thought passed my mind before I changed this. There were some great comments on there. I think I'll probably feel happy and blog on Friday, for some reason or other. Some person might know that reason. I have recently been feeling this urge to write in here, but I have to keep in mind that I also have to write for creative writing.  So I have to keep things even. Well I be back on Friday or sometime this weekend.

      Missing someone while they're gone is a natural thing. You love someone so much when only after 5 hours since they left, you feel that undenialable feeling. You just can't help but miss someone whom you love while they are gone for almost a week. This past couple of days, I haven't got a lot of sleep. It seems that every day has been a battle for me. Every class, every hour, every assignment. Every little second has been on my mind all the time. At the end of most of the days, I felt extremely exhausted and tired. People could tell me to go to bed earlier. Well, that doesn't help at all because I lay there looking at the ceiling and I just think. I think until my brain gives up. I can't help thinking. I've never been a great sleeper. I have always had trouble sleeping. But these past few days have been challenging. Meg gets back sometime tomorrow. Just knowing that makes me feel so damn happy.

      The sparkling conversation while on a ski lift gives one just a small glance in some stranger's life. Usually people don't talk to each other on a ski lift if they don't know each other, but occasionally you'll have a kind soul talking to you. I say a kind soul because what else could I think of them. I only get to talk to them for a couple of minutes. The conversations are mostly about skiing, where you are from, and are you having fun. The conversation no matter how quaint and trivial makes the ride seem shorter. What kind of people are these great athletes? What can I make of them with just a two-minute glance into the window of their lives? Mostly I want them to be kind, admirable people. I don't know why I want this. Maybe I consider myself some sort of inspector of humankind.  Skiing was great. Never have I experienced such a thrill. Yes, there are roller coasters, but I would have to consider a roller coaster a slightly impersonal thrill. Yes, it is an individual experience, but it is also a mass experience as well. They are built for the masses, not the individual. Now think about skiing. The skis, the boots, and the poles are all fitted for you. You control which way you go, the difficulty of the trail you want to ride, and the style you want to ride. You choose if you want to carve down the slope, or to head straight down the slope as fast you can.  Last but not least, the beauty of it all was stunning, breath taking. While I was skiing down this slope, a plane flew overhead. The combination reminded me of a James Bond movie. Along with the hum of the plane engine and the whoosh of my skiis, my mind added the James Bond theme song. I bet from the plane the hill across from the skiing slopes looked like the back of a sleeping snow-white hairy monster. I was simply amazed about how inspired I got just standing at the top of the hill watching the sun go down. Nothing is as quite beautiful as the sun setting behind the trees while you are going down the slope....Did I say nothing was quite as beautiful? Well there is one person that I could think of at that moment. Staring down the hill with the sun on top of the trees on the other hill, looking a jewel upon crown, there was one person that I thought about amidst all this natural beauty. I couldn't help but to think of Meg. I stood there atop that hill for about a minute thinking about her and this place. I couldn't help but to think in a way both of them are equal in their beauty. If I had to choose between the two of them, I know I would love to be at Meg's side. It has come to my attention that a lot of my entries are about Meg in some way, but let me ask you this: If you love someone so much, you need to express your feelings for them in some way, shape, or form. This happens to be my way. The written word is a powerful thing.

      This weekend was an incredible weekend. It just plain kicked ass. No other words could suffice for it. It has been just awesome. For me, it was a much needed vacation really. Each night was pretty damn cool in its own special way. Friday, the 13th, was great. We watched Pet Semetary and I think I will never look at little kids the same nor give them sharp objects such as scalpel, but with Meg in my arms, it was an amazing time. Valentine's Day was a memorable day for me really. We watched the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen together, and she was in my arms again. It was the first time I had been in a wonderful relationship with someone on Valentine's Day. It was the first time I realized how great love is. Even though I didn't spend much time with her, every minute was great. After leaving her house, I tracked down the gang and proceeded to have more fun. After writing sex in the snow in very big letters, we vacated the premises of the park and headed to Spence's house. Not much followed after that. Sunday, We watched Lost in Translation and for the third time in that weekend, Meg was in my arms while we were watching a movie. God, I love her. Anyways, we watched Lost in Translation, which had Meg and Me lost as well. After that, we went and took a peek at the fire at Timberlake Estates. I don't know whose house it was, but I hope they are alright. Basically this weekend was a great little getaway from stresses and burdens of school.  Lately, I've been coming up with some strange and crazy ideas. Here are just two of them.  1. The Mexican Plan: One night of many Mountain Dews, I came upon an idea for a joke. I don't think I'll ever do it in my lifetime, but it's funny to think about. It basically involves crossing the border to the south into Mexico. Then my cousins and I would round up about 10 or 15 Mexicans and head back across the border. We would head North. We would cross the border into Canada. Once in Canada, we would head for Toronto. At Toronto, we would drop the Mexicans off there and head back to the U.S.  2. Successful Infiltration of an Amish Community: This idea I have been thinking about a lot lately. I don't know, but I think I could pull it off. Yes, I would have to prepare for a couple of years. Learn German, because that's what they speak primarily, Learn High German, which they use for religious ceremonies. Did you know that most Amish people are trilingual. Amazing, eh? Anyways, I would have to get myself some Amish clothes and a buggy. Do you know how Amish teenagers rebel? By supping up their horse buggies. I'm serious. They put tassels on it. I don't have to worry about growing a beard or a mustache. The men are supposed to start growing their beards after they marry. And the Amish never have mustaches because they believe mustaches are an association to the military. I've actually done some research on the Amish because I have an idea for a character and I have to have some sort of an idea about their culture and their way of life.  Adios

      I warn you this is an incredibly long blog entry. These are just some of the poems I turned in for my poetry notebook along with my comments below them.   Odyssey of the Elite  Unbreakable dedication to war Networks of mass volume An orchid underground Chalky giants in their criminal environment A marvelous ghetto Quest for man split The wrong battle for truth The demolition of revolution Naturally mischievous Standard exceptions are made for solid proof An Odyssey of the elite Nothing more than turbulence A complete mix-mash of variety  This poem doesn't make much sense because we had cut out words of magazines that we liked, put them in a bag, and pull them out one by one. I had to use the words in the exact same order as I took them out   Undeniable Love  This love is a crazy embrace A fantastic dance Amazingly unbelievable Chocolate sweet It feels like I have broken destruction This puzzled pattern has caught me I?m hopefully miserable It feels like uncontrollable spinning I?m a brave coward beyond hiding Fighting this logical war This angelic insanity I can?t hold back Its ascending growth is deliciously terrific It is so devilishly evil That it is driving me emotionally insane Making me a cracked creation This is undeniable love  This poem I dedicate to my dear Meg. God only knows how much I love her.   Inspiration Composition  Inspiration is a key that unlocks and unleashes a great masterpiece Inspiration is a nudge that sends one into a spiral of ideas Inspiration is a never-ending hallway With doors on either side All unlocked, Never empty Each full of possibilities Inspiration is a moment when all that surrounds a person shouts, ?Create! Paint! Dance! Write!? until one surrenders to their will Completely, without doubts Inspiration is thirty foot tall tidal wave that you can either ride and conquer And become one with it in that moment Or just let the wave wash you out utterly Inspiration is the whisper in the wind The beauty of a fiery red sunset Lightning from a clear, blue sky The winding path in the forest A snowy mountain in the distance All of these are Inspiration at its finest hour It can mean everything, anything, or nothing Endless and forever Inspiration dreams  Inspiration is a very important thing in my writing so I wrote a poem about it.    Nothing but a puddle  Under the shade of a thorny short tree lies a puddle smelling like a summer rain shower A scent of wet dirt clouds the air The dying golden grass descends upon the shores of the puddle Pieces of ice in the middle Looking like shipwrecked travelers Part of this murky water is dark The side that faces the setting sun glows a fiery red A homage to the sun?s last light This water has no significance or importance Nothing but a puddle  Ah, this poem came from one of my earlier writings on describing a puddle.   A Gentle Wonder  As the setting sun?s fiery light cascades down the foggy mountain An insolent hawk glides through the hazy air Like a rose petal falling off its flower in a sweet summer wind A dramatic prelude to the brewing storm A calm moment before the crazy inferno of snow sets in The sun caresses the mysterious summit A phenomenal jewel upon a shining helm In that superfluous moment the old precipice was enchanting Soon after Winter cast its evil spell The ground became quilted with snow Laced with glittering ice It seemed like a sweet eternity Before this episode of distress subsided Winter?s symphony quit its music Twilight uplifted, Serenity renewed The sunrise, a gentle wonder Coaxes the mountain into an aching recovery The shining star forges a golden river up the mountainside  Actually, I can't remember how this poem came about. Bloody hell. That's going to bug me for a while.   Memories Past   I remember running around the playground at recess playing legendary games of kickball I remember throwing mud at the girls with John Stanley who was my partner-in-crime I remember the welcomed end of the school day when I?d rush to the awaiting buses in the parking lot I remember saying Good Afternoon to my old and wise bus driver, George who always gave us candy and fudge with a warm smile I remember eating ice cream on a calm summer night when I got to stay up late I remember running around my yard with my cat, Tiger Pretty who got his name by the loss of my sister?s cat I remember playing the never-ending games of Couch Karate that only my siblings and I played I remember how my room changed every few months and how giant it seemed I remember the fourth of July at my house with dazzling sparklers in both hands I remember waking from a nightmare of a giant Easter Bunny chasing me I remember being afraid of clowns due to watching Stephen King?s it at an early age I remember a great and glorious childhood  Ah, my childhood was grand one.   A Tree?s Tragedy  Days have gone by Time has always told Infant trees cry Their parents cut and sold They weep for their own Leaves glistening gold New seeds will be sown But still they shed their tears Gone is all they have known On and on, grow their fears Of dry and dismal days Only when saplings come of age Do the trees? spirits raise And the elder trees calm their rage They drop their leaves or fruit A relief from stress and burden The young trees follow suit Although they are not quite certain But still they shed their solemn tears As an open act of remembrance A custom for upcoming years That trees have been following since They are doing it now even as I write Every tree, small to tall, one and all Practicing their ceremonial rite Thus came about the season of fall  Yes, yes, we all remember this one. I turned this in and got a lot of criticism that I didn't want. I stuck to my ways, which is being stubborn and didn't change anything except the title.   This Game of Life  Why do you all think That I think Life is just a game? Is that how I come off or is that just how you think? I am who I am and  I do take life seriously But not as seriously as you do You got to have a little fun in life or You?ll never get out alive I?m sorry that I?m stubborn but that?s the way I am An immovable rock Maybe this rock doesn?t want to collect any moss I am who I am Get over it, past it, or whatever it takes because I?ve left you in the dust while you were trying to figure out how I think If Life was a game to me I?d send you the memo Telling you so Because you think I?m too busy  Off in my own world Playing games I?m sorry to disappoint you but you and I live in the same world and this is nothing but a game.  This was a poem written purely out of anger. I don't know if I like it or not.   Cliffhanging a Dream  Unexplainable dreams Illogical nightly excursions No shoes, No shirt, No service Not much sense can be made from the inane babble How can you tell what is real or not? Dreams can walk a thin line Between reality and surrealism What if when you fall asleep in this world You?re really just waking up in another A delusion dimension with nothing but twist and turns The only way you can tell Dreams from reality is undoubtedly through What?   Bitter Sweet  Bittersweet is this lone wanderer?s life Desert heat beating down on him like a crazy embrace His life is deliciously terrific A cracked creation gone astray His heart is smoky cold An icy fire that burns irrevocably Frozen dead are his memories This designed dismay has hurled him into a painful fury A hopeful misery for a deathly life No one hears his pleading whines or bawling begs Forever mirrored is his indefinite reflection This devilish evil lurks out of hiding Wondering why and how he had fallen from his angelic height  This poem is obviously about the devil, but I can't remember why I felt like writing about the devil. Maybe the devil made me do it.   Wanton Power  Power At first, it is brazen The user wants nothing but good They want to see the wrongs righted The criminals caught and imprisoned Their empire, kingdom, or country become prodigious But sooner or later, usually sooner Power corrupts all things Turning the zealous into a psychotic neophyte Making all serene things chaotic No longer listening to oracles or requiems Only hearing their ill-founded beliefs No longer counseled by serendipity Their only real passion left is to focus on gaining one thing more wanton power  This was sort of inspired by Lord of the Rings. I don't know if I like it or not.   Poetic nonetheless  Poetry is a wondrous way to write Each line giving off a different effect Than the last No one can ascertain what poetry is Except the writer and the reader These quilts of ideas are given to people To interpret how they may or may not With passion, a writer can invoke a thrill or a distress With just a pair of words Whether you may be the hard-working indigenous peoples of wherever or the aristocratic vaudevillian of someplace Poetry can shed a light on darkness  in the corners of your mind Make you take those striding steps out of delusion A wind blowing away the fog  or the fog blowing in Insomnia and Schizophrenia could set in but there is one truth Poetic nonetheless   A calming walk  Long summer walks Along the dirt road Sun setting in the sky Long shadows on a road Brilliant colors in the clouds A cool breeze blows Smell of wild roses in the ditches Rufus runs ahead Animals scattering through the woods The roar of tractor engines A cloud of dust rises I go on walks  To calm my nerves I feel the tension leave As I breathe in the fresh air  This was one of the two prose to poetry things I wrote.   That one special day  The voices of the gathering crowd rose and fell Like the roar of waves rolling onto a sandy coast Jaws of anxiety tightened Like a boa constrictor?s hug Her family and maid of honor Buzzing bees about her Perfume of roses hung in the air The luminescent shade of dawn The deep hue of burgundy wine Steely satin pulled around her Icy teeth of the zipper bit at her spine Cloud of fabric fell over the bride?s face Veiled in her mist Dresses in the shade of ripe cranberries Amazing Grace clothed the room It was time The elegant procession began She begun the journey That would tie her forever to her love  The other prose to poetry I wrote   A blank page, but not a blank mind  A blank page A writer?s worst nightmare or greatest dream No beginning, No end Nothing at all Taunting you to write but you can?t put your thoughts in ink yet A blank page A writer?s Mount Everest Unscaleable in hazy times Easily conquered in clear times But once you reach the summit What then? You can go only go back down and find some other mountain to climb This blank page Slowly becoming full Every blank, a newfound battle Beating back the doubts into the oblivion of the night On this page, a poem was written Meaning that someone had the gumption to bring their thoughts into reality  Ah this poem is one I wrote when I was truly inspired and I like it.   A Never-ending chain  Friendship is a never-ending chain Each of us are links Through this chain, we are brought together Knowing one person means knowing another Trust is the fire that welds these links together Friendship is the forge and anvil It heats us up and changes who and what we are forever Friendship is a burning torch on a quiet night Guiding people through dark times Beating away all fears and doubts Friendship is a towering shield Protecting people from harm and hurt Friendship is a vessel  that everyone has ridden over troubled waters Friendship is something everyone needs  Ah, Friendship.  Well, my friends, if you have read this all the way through, you are a champion. Congrats.

               I could sit here and tell you that my absence from blog was from tennis matches or writing my short story in creative writing, but I'm not going to. When I am busy, it is hard to get away and blog.          I just am glad that the week is basically over. I'm so ready to see Meg outside of school. With 3 matches this week and the short story, I've had little time to actually relax. I've been attacked by some many days of the week and have tasted bitter defeat throughout the week.         I'm ready for some adventure. I want to go driving to random places during a foggy night. I want to go out to Stone Cabin and Anderson's. I want to dance under the thundering sky with blowing me this way and that. I want to go rock climbing. I want to go canoeing down a river. I want to box. I want to watch all the great movies and listen to the best music. I want to watch drunks desperately try to dance and fall down trying. I want to laugh my ass off after some tells a stupid joke or says something incredibly strange and funny. I want to spend some time with Meg. I want to say the most romantic things to her. I want to finish my short story.             Speaking of which, I've decided on a title: Nine Out of Ten. It's a heist story, so it's going to take a while to write. Right now, I'm working a five page rewrite. It's not all that fun, but you gotta do what you gotta do.              Tomorrow we play Shelbyville, so we going to break this losing streak that we're in. I kind of tired of losing, but we have been playing the best team. I feel that I have definitely improved since my freshmen year. I feel like that I can actually play well at times. Well, I'm out for now.

      I, Samuel Levi Van Geison, do hereby solemnly swear that I will not consume any amount of Mountain Dew starting now and lasting until the day after prom. If I fail to meet this oath, I will admit that I have no will power whatsoever and that I have a problem, but until then I will do no such thing.

      Fifth day into this strange world without Mountain Dew. Everything seems a lot slower. Time seems to go by a pace of snail. I think I consumed my last Mountain Dew on Tuesday before I took on this fast. So far, it has been interesting. I have tried to substitute Mountain Dew with other sodas like Coca-Cola or Crush. That didn't work at all. I tried drinking Red Bulls and SoBe, but those things taste so awful. I don't just drink Mountain Dew for the caffeine. I drink it because I love the taste of it on my tongue.   The reason for all this. The fast, I mean, is because my dad is trying to quit smoking. He's been smoking for most of his life and I find that it is a valiant effort to try and stop. So rather than indulging myself on Mountain Dew while he's trying to quit, I would try to put myself into the same mindset as him. He's still smoking, but not as much as he has. He's on the patch at this moment. I wonder if they have a Mountain Dew Patch or Mountain Dewaholics Anonymous.  "Hi. My name is Sam and I'm Mountain Dewaholic."  The first step is to admit you have a problem.   Another reason is because I don't want to depend upon Mountain Dew like something I can kick back on. I realize I drink a lot of Mountain Dew, but that can't be helped. I'm thoroughly addicted.  Is it odd that I actually miss Mountain Dew? As far back as I can remember, I have drunk Mountain Dew. Most of the time, people aren't shocked by the fact that I have some amount of Mountain Dew nearby. Have I grown that attached to this green liquid? It is funny to see the expressions upon people's faces when I tell them I'm on a Mountain Dew fast. You'd think the world was going to end by the look on their faces.   But I think I leave you hanging right here. So, chiao.

      This week and this weekend have been horrible. Horrible might be an understatement.  In between the night of Prom and Sunday, my great-aunt Florence passed away. I wish I could tell you all the great stories about her. Like her name implies, she was a delicate and beautiful, positively radiant. She was probably one of the most caring, compassionate, and loving people I have ever met to date. If you just moved into the neighborhood, she would offer you help with money when you needed it even though youre a complete stranger to her. I remember eating a million meals at her house and I cant recall a bad dinner. That woman would cook forever if you showed any sign or hint of being a bit hungry. I remember one time she made a grill cheese that was so perfect. Thats high praise indeed coming from a kid who has had his share of grilled cheese sandwiches. Every dinner, she would light up when there was a crowd. She was happy filling the stomachs of her children, grandchildren, and other relatives with delicious food. Not only was she a cook, but she was also a great person. My great-aunt Florence had a wonderful connection with every person she met, weaving us all into a great beautiful tapestry. That connection still flows through all the people that had the fortune to meet her. That connection is love. We would all be lucky to live such lives. To find someone that you love and care for with all your heart and they return that love and back fully to you. That you should settle down in a community that you love. Ultimately, somewhere down this crazy road called life, you will find love, no matter whether youre looking or not. This is an ode to my great-aunt Florence. May your soul rest in peace and I will forever love you. I didnt get to say Good-Bye or I love you one last time, but we still have that connection of love. I will still have all those memories of you, those everlasting pictures inside my head. I will always love you.  Monday, the tennis team played Shelbyville for the second time. We won again, but this time wasnt a complete shutout. I couldnt help feeling like a jerk when I left. The kid I played Monday was the same kid that I played the last time. Let me put this delicately. This kid shouldnt have been playing tennis. I mean that in a nice way. Some of my shots were so slow that any regular player would cream me, but the kid could hardly make it to the ball at times. I won pretty quickly, but then I had to prepare myself to feel even more like a jerk. I play doubles with Will Kersey and guess that shows up onto the court, the same kid I played in singles along with a kid who I think has cerebral palsy. Great. Im going to Hell for this one, I think to myself. Will and I won pretty quickly, but I still felt like a jerk about it. Tuesday, we played Macarthur. I dont think anyone won any of their matches. Wednesday and Thursday, our practices were cut short due to rain. Wednesday, I found out that my grandfather has been diagnosed with lung cancer and my great-aunts funeral is Friday, which is also the day of the Central State Eight tournament. This produces a small problem, but long story short I was able to go to both of them. Rohan and me did all right, but we lost both of our matches. On the bright side, I didnt have to wake up early today to go play tennis. Wednesday, I was victim to theft of money. Before strength training, I had $30 in my wallet. When I go to get a Mountain Dew (By the way, I lasted about a week and three days on my fast), my wallet is completely devoid of any green. Naturally, Im flabbergasted and incredibly pissed off. Had you put boxing gloves on my fists, I would have killed someone in that moment. The odd thing is that this is the second time this has happened to me and I have had my locker combination changed. The first time it was only five lousy dollars, but theres a lot you can do with thirty bucks. Luckily, the thieving little bastard left the change in my pocket. Funny, he was that desperate for money to get into my locker and steal the money out of my wallet, but does not take the change. I reported it to Mr. Action Jackson, but truthfully I doubt that Ill ever know who stole my money. I had enough to buy a Mountain Dew. Just think how pissed off I would have been without my daily Mountain Dew. Do you remember when they used to chop off a thiefs hand if he was caught? That image runs through my head for one instant, then BAM! Its gone. I become the calm little center of the world once I feel the cold refreshing taste of Mountain Dew hitting my tongue. Immediate tranquility. Chemicals and electric messages of bliss are sent throughout my body, relaxing me somewhat.   Meg was gone for a good deal of the week. She left Wednesday for envirothon, and didnt get back until Thursday. She left Friday for the band trip, but before she did, I got to kiss her good-bye, twice. I was sitting down in Mr. Schmitz, and as always, I was doing nothing in particular. I watched the band loading the buses through the window. I saw Meg, an idea popped into my head. After she loaded her luggage into the bus, she headed back towards the Science Wing doors. Acting quickly, I asked Mr. Schmitz if I could go to my locker. Instead of going to my locker, I headed straight for the band room. Im such a rebel. She came out of the band room, looking quite surprised to see me. I told simply I had to say good-bye and I love you for one time before she left. You can call me corny, or a hopeless romantic, but I needed to see her one last time. I would like to think that I have left a lasting impression on Meg. God, I love her. If I had one dying wish (Im not dying, this all is hypothetical.), I would wish that you all would find someone that you love and care for the way that I do for Meg and she does for me. But many of you may ask yourselves Is this really love? Can two juniors in high school actually love each other? Well my friends, love knows no boundaries nor does it have an age limit. You can either believe my words or not.   Both Friday and Saturday, I have stayed home basically because the lack of anything to do or any body to do anything with. So I sit here, dwelling over the weeks past events and wondering about the week to come.   I wish you all a good night and a good morning.

      This is supposed to be a play script. Pardon any spelling or grammar errors, but I am writing this as I speak. It shouldn't be all that long.   Man Versus Blog    A red-haired green-eyed kid walks into a halfway finished office/shop. A dusty red Mustang is parked in the garage part of the building. In the office area, there is a computer. Sitting on the desk, there is a identical looking person with a pistol in his hand.  NARRATOR:What if you blogged so much and poured your soul into your blog that your blog became its own entity, complete with emotions, wants, and needs. What if your blog became its own person? It would certainly demand your attention. You wouldn't neglect it as much, now would you? Think about it. One day you come home. You get on the internet and from your computer a person spawned, identical to your looks. How would you react? Most people would probably think they had gone insane, but let's just say one kid didn't go insane. He welcomed this weird copy of himself into his life, embracing him totally. But what if he ignored his blog for a month? What if that blog became angry at his creator? What then, my friends? KID #1:(nervously)Hey, Dave. What are you doing here? DAVE: Not much, Jack. Just checking to see if your computer is working. What's wrong? You don't write. You don't call. Don't you want to be friends anymore? JACK: Yeah, but you kind of scared me. I mean most ordinary people don't carry guns around.(Gesturing towards gun) What's that for? DAVE: Oh, this.(Twirls gun casually) This is merely a method of persuasion. So have you been for the past couple of weeks? Am I no longer your friend?(Angrily) Do you not trust me anymore or have you found something else? Did you get a Xanga account? JACK: No, no, no....It's not like that, Dave. I've just been busy, that's all. There is no reason to get angry. Please put the gun down. DAVE:(Lies the gun down on the desk) If there's any reason I should be angry, it's you. What am I? Some kind of whore that you leave hanging whenever you please? Well I have come to end this treatment.(Picks gun back up) I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't take this anymore. It ends now.(Points gun at Jack) JACK:(Pleadingly) Put the gun down, please. I promise that I'll blog more. DAVE: I can't accept that. I know you won't keep to your promise. You've done it before. You'll do it again. Plus, promises are like rules, they're made to be broken. You said it yourself. JACK: Fine. Then shoot me. You will only be destroying yourself and your creator.(Crosses his arms) Go ahead and shoot me. DAVE: Shut up, you useless twit. You don't get it, do you? You poured too much of your soul into me. I won't die if I shoot you. JACK: How do you know? You didn't make the rules, so for all that you know, you could be killing yourself when you shoot me. DAVE: Only one way to find out then, is there? (Shoots Jack in the head. Jack falls onto the ground. Dave stands there, unmoved. He comes out of a trance.)Hmmm, not dead.(Touches his arm) I was right after all. But what's that smell?(Sniffs) Smells like smoke.(Drops onto the ground, blood gushing from his head. As he hits the ground, Dave evaporates into thin air.) NARRATOR: Maybe we should all pay more attention to the things in our lives: jobs, friends, and our blogs. Should a person be careful in starting a blog? Should a person pour their soul into their blog? For each person, the answer is different, just like the meaning of life.

                "  If a picture is worth a thousand words, then are a thousand words worth a picture?"           As the summer is coming to end, I realize just how passive I am. I sit around and think about things rather than taking action. I think about my future, that I'll go to college, learn many things, and start my career as a writer. But the thing is I don't know if I could make it as a writer. I write for myself, really. There are times when I write for someone or something. I also don't want to be blinded by an image of me being the next great American writer like so many fools do. I know for a fact I won't write the next great American novel. I still write nonetheless simply because I love to write, especially things that have meaning and a purpose behind them. I wouldn't say that I am a good writer. I would just say I write. And to me, what I write is significant, like all of my stories and poems are really just children of mine, being born into this world out of my mind. I would be content if a story or poem of mine were published, but that is not my goal. I merely hope for the best. Not only for me, but for everybody reading this. You rarely hear about people wishing their friends to end up in some shithole job that they hate.       From this summer, I've learned that I'm out of touch with reality. I'm not realist, let's face it. That's really why I write. When I'm bored I seek to remove myself from the real world, and try to make up my own. I did it when I was kid and still do it now. Things start to get boring, I imagine a car crashing outside my house. When it storms, I imagine a report on tv saying a murderer has escaped prison and is in my area. Like Jules de Gaultier said,'Imagination is the one weapon in the war against reality.' Now I know there are millions of realists in this world, but I am who I am and what I believe. Does it make me insane? Nah, but part of being sane, is being a little bit crazy as Janet Long says.       The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four Americans is suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of your three best friends. If they're okay, then it's you.---Rita Mae Brown      I read this and thought...yep, it checks out. I am insane. But a little insanity never hurt anyone. Now a lot of insanity could.      With every beginning, there is an ending. And guess what, my friends? This is it.

       I look around this room and I see...utter chaos.  Blankets and pillows thrown haphazardly all throughout the room. The disheveled mattress making its way towards the floor. A mosaic of Doritos lays on the carpet just waiting to be admired. Empty soda cans litter all my shelves, tables, or anything with a flat surface including the floor. All of the pictures on my walls are crooked. And I think 12 hours ago this room was clean. It's amazing what 5 guys can do to a room in one night.  The five guys included me, Spencer, Gregg, Andy and Will. Last night and most of this morning was pretty fun. I know I had a lot of fun. I can't remember half of the things we did, but I know for a fact it was blast, for me anyways. Everything seems blurry. I know we were planning to kill Rob Kennedy, but the plan fell through, as in we went to Family Video, instead, and rented Memento and Dead or Alive 3. I also know we played Texas Hold 'Em and I got cleaned out, but hey you can't win them all, right? I know for a fact that I was awake at 8:30 this morning and hadn't had a wink of sleep. I'm pretty sure that I wrestled a lot. For some reason, Will kept referring to himself to Moses and somehow found a way to fall down while resting against the wall. I know that out of 5 guys, three of us were still awake at 6 a.m. Another funny thing, we had a discussion about our favorite movies, which eventually turned to a discussion about the best movie of a certain genre. Because obviously I can't decide. And we came no closer to making a decision about the best of a genre. I seriously couldn't pick a favorite movie. There are so many great movies, but with every great movie comes a thousand crappy movies. But I must say I love watching movies, by myself or with company.       At the moment, I'm incredibly tired, so I must retire for the night, but I promise I'll be back.
