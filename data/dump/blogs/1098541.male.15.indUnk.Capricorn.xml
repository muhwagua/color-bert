      For instance....Omelets.  When one talks to me about a omelet, I think of Hamlet, soooo two different images come to mind.  One is an ham omelet.  The second is Ben Alshire wrapped up in egg screaming.  The Ben one comes more often than not.  But the point is......the point is that instead of killing whales for their blubber, we should instead give them liposuction.  Therefore we have our blubber, and the whales are nice and trim.  Though the whale aerobic instructors might be a little miffed.  But they can suck it up and get another job like.....I don't know....plumbing??  Well that's all, good bye all my little grape vines in humus.  Nora a.k.a- the whaling liposuction surgeon naturalist.

      Wellllllllllllll.........tis a loverly day, but I wouldnt know cuz I dont have a lover but thats allllll besides the point. The point is.......the point is the dolphins dont like sea water, but they only like to live there because they like the free salt for their margaritas.  That the only reason they act so stupid and allow us to screw with their minds.  But thats not the point either........what the hell are you looking at me like that????  Does it look like I know the point.  For someone who thinks dolphins are alcoholics you sure have a lot of faith in me.  Gezzz.........*walks off muttering...then 800 lb wreaking ball swings down and kills her.  Aplause fallows.*   (the following is from Logan since she isn't on her own computer.) Hiya all!   mesa is having fuuuun....weeeeee.   Aww nori...I'll be your lover!!  oops...I've said that to WAY to many people, I'll have to start making commitments!   damn...oh well, love you all anyway!

      So tommarow is Valentine's day at MRU. Aka "massive PDA / mad sex-ified hormone filled teenagers day"  For those of you lucky lucky children who have never had to experiance this attrocity, let me explain.  The torture starts in the morning. You walk into the building, and trip over middleschoolers sucking face in the lobby. you ram into them everywhere you go. finnily, after you manage to fight your way past all the sex crazed mutants, you get to TA (aka, homeroom). Here, you are presented with carnations, sold by the NHS. If you have a boy friend, or a just a friend, who cares about such things, you get massive ammounts of these icky smelling things. If you have no friends, you get one from the NHS that says "Happy Valentine's day, from a friend." This is supposed to make you feel better about not having anyone who's willing to spend a dollar on you. however, it acctually makes you feel like crap. 'cause if you carry around a carnation "from a friend", then everyone knows that you have no friends. whereas, if you don't carry any carnations around at all, it just looks like you got lots and stuck them in your locker. This whole thing was much more of a problem in middleschool, when i actually cared about what everyone thought...But according to Hannah, who has had the very unfortunate experiance of having freeky mutant guys, who she dosn't know, send her tons of carnations, teddybears, roses, and chocolates, getting a carnation "from a friend" is acctually not the worst thing that can happen to you.  So after TA, which you spend inching away from the couples making out in the corners, or, for that matter, in the center of the room, you fight your way to your first class. This is made very difficult by the fact that the sex crazedcouples have multiplyed, and their actions have progressed to acctual R-rated groping. They do this in the center of the hall, and in the center of the stairwell. Why, i don't know. It's some sort of odd physical phenomion - the center off the hall way is apparently better for making-out than the sides of the hallway. so after smashing through the hormone landmine zone, and arriving at your first class, you are greeted with some strangely over enthusiastic teacher who gives everyone little sugary heart candys that say "hot stuff" and "love 4ever" on them. They taste like toothpaste.  It goes on like this all day. The hormones rage higher on a flood of sugar and SEX, and when you fight your way to the bathroom, you find 10 girls in there, sobbing thier eyes out. Apparently their offerings of love, or shall we say, infatuation, have been shunned. Or the man of their dreams has been spotted chewing on someone elses tounge. (sorry for the god awful discriptions, but this is really what they do.).  At lunch, you are surrounded by couples sitting in eachothers laps, and yet more tounge chewing and sobbing girls. It's enough to make you loose your appitite. Plus, you notice that all the ugly middle school girls seem to have boyfriends, and you don't. Not that you really want to add to the mess, but it's slightly depressing anyway.  By the end of the day, the PDA is really x-rated. and the wailing girls have given up on the line for the bathroom, and are instead crying it all out infront of their lockers, while a group of their friends try to console them by saying bad things about "that jerk."   and the janators are left to clean up piles of smushed candy hearts and rotten flowers.   ~Rosilita, the bitter and sarcastic, but otherwise content

      This is horrible.  there are those stupid ads on kings of chaos, and one that comes up alot  is this thing about breast cancer, saying that so many thousand women will get it in the next year and 40,000 will die.  And i know that my mom was one of those women who got it, and she was lucky to get rid of it. and my aunt nancy will be one of those women who dies, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  And then they have another ad that says, "are you over 21 and do you smoke? win a TV!"  What is wrong with the world?  ok, i have to stop writing about this now because it's really depressing and if i don't stop i'm gonna start crying. ~laura aka the cannibal

      Has anyone noticed how anvil and advil are spelled similar and sound similar?  So like if you go to a drug store and ask for advil and they throw an anvil at you then....since you would probably be dead...would that count as a pain reliever?

      Wheaton Squier: it's an art Meghan Faulkner: ok, whatever you say, but anyone can procrastinate, on;y the truly talented can get it done early Wheaton Squier: .....yeah Wheaton Squier: but it can still be considered am art Meghan Faulkner: HOW??? Wheaton Squier: anyone can spatter pain on a canvas and call it art 9:40 PM Wheaton Squier: hang on Wheaton Squier: fine then Meghan Faulkner: how is it art Wheaton Squier: how is it not? Meghan Faulkner: it does not involve creating anything new, it is an act, there is no final product Wheaton Squier: ah Wheaton Squier: there is nothing Wheaton Squier: and that is what you are trying to get Meghan Faulkner: yes Wheaton Squier: nothing is the product Meghan Faulkner: but then it is not an art form, because a product is something not nothing Meghan Faulkner: right? Wheaton Squier: no Meghan Faulkner: i think? Wheaton Squier: anything can be art Meghan Faulkner: but it has to be something not nothing Wheaton Squier: why? 9:45 PM Meghan Faulkner: because you just said anything can be art, but to be anything it has to be something nothing Wheaton Squier: nothing is something Meghan Faulkner: no nothing is nothing Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: we will say that nothing is nothing Wheaton Squier: nothing can still be art Meghan Faulkner: thank you Wheaton Squier: if you had a blank canvas, what is it? Meghan Faulkner: if that is what you want to be believe, so be it Wheaton Squier: is it something? Meghan Faulkner: the beginnings of art Wheaton Squier: not the canvas Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: so we have the beginning of art Wheaton Squier: is that something? Meghan Faulkner: yes but not art Wheaton Squier: so if i said "that's art" what would you say? 9:50 PM Meghan Faulkner: no, because it was not made by human hands, did you grow the flax or whatever and weave it, and all of that fun stuff Wheaton Squier: so it's not you're saying? Meghan Faulkner: yes, i'm saying that it is not Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: but you have me the "artist" who is saying that in-fact that IS art and who are you to say it's not? Meghan Faulkner: if you created it, maybe it is art, but if you go buy a canvas, display it, and whatever, it is not art!!!!! Wheaton Squier: so i can't proclaim the blank canvas art 9:55 PM Meghan Faulkner: not unless you created it Wheaton Squier: is a parakeet paints something is it art? Meghan Faulkner: yes, it created it Meghan Faulkner: i think Wheaton Squier: okay, so if i covered my canvas with paint and then scraped it all off Wheaton Squier: is that art Meghan Faulkner: no, it was, but you destroyed it Wheaton Squier: no Meghan Faulkner: if there were holes or scrape marks, it might be Wheaton Squier: i say that if that's what i was trying to do then it's art Meghan Faulkner: if you purposefully created them Meghan Faulkner: yes Wheaton Squier: so if i purposely left it blank... Meghan Faulkner: NO!!!!!!!!!!!! Wheaton Squier: WHY NOT???? Wheaton Squier: i can say it is Wheaton Squier: that's what i want to portray Wheaton Squier: i blank canvas Meghan Faulkner: yes, but maybe i don't agree with you 10:00 PM Wheaton Squier: oh yes i know that Wheaton Squier: so if you see it in a museum next to other things what would you call ot Meghan Faulkner: i would silently wonder what the heck it is there for Wheaton Squier: heh heh heh Meghan Faulkner: but, if you become a famous artist, with blank canvases, yeah, right, i'd support you Wheaton Squier: wow Wheaton Squier: we need to argue in person sometime  -wheaton AKA the blank one.....

Will seek him out and have a long chat about the great things in life....I'm sure he'll agree with me on what those things are.  But I will NOT stalk him like someone else we know might ::coughcoughcarissacoughcough::  ::coughs turn to hacks, then weezes, collapses to the floor, dies...again:: Is it possible to die more then one time?

      I have tea and chocoalte cake.   the world is a wonderful place...  on the way to CT on saturday, i saw a billboard (*gasp* horrible ugly things!) with a picture of the originial really big green monster thing that nate pasted wheaton's face on.  (note rosie's total lack of pop-culture...i'm guessing it was a movie monster?).  anyway, i saw that and i went "HA!"  good story rosie, good story... in other news,  today laura and i talked to logan about bunnies.  and slash.  and such. it was ammusing.  laura was shock-ed.  i was not.   and that was that.  i'm sorry, i'm really trying here, but you know, nothing of any importance and/or intrest is jumping to mind (why do we say jumping?  why not "swiming to mind?"  walking?  strolling?  tiptoeing?)  ah well, some one else should try this updating thing sometime...

So, if you had a dream that you and.....uh, huh...ok, Betty Crocker...(hahahaha! How great! so random!) were baking brownies together, would Betty Crocker be sleeping in her bed, dreming about baking brownies with some freak, AKA: you?  Just a though I had.

I have nothing to do...Wheeee-boring. People need to call or IM me and make times so I have something to do with people other then stay up till 2 and sleep till noon...it gets very boring very quickly. Not to mention tiring.   My typing's go to hell today...pay no mind to any blantant typos.  The baot's in the water...it was so gorgeous at the lake today. We didn't have time to sail, but the water was all choppy and the wind was blowing hard across the lake, and it was cold, so I sat on the dock's end and got splashed on by waves and watched the golden sunset...days like today are great. It was so awesome to see Crown Point ruins bathed in gold light...and seagulls...and water...and dammit...I wanted my camera. Byut it was at home... :(  I'm gonna leave now...but I'll be on for awhile.   T.Y.L- (Ta You Lot) Carissa, the overly-eccentric.

      Ok so here is a question, I appreciate all replies.  Have you ever been in love, and how many times? Was the other person i love with you too, and which times? What is being in love? Do you think a person can be in love more than once, or is there one special someone for everyone?  Elaborate, I just wander what your guys opinions on this are.  Thanks! Oh and did you want my answers, if anyone does, say so I'll post mine too.

      Yeah, that'd be gravity.  Anyway, that has nothing to do with this post.  So hi to everyone, and Susannah especially, welcome!  Getting ready for exams, life sucks, in other words, however, I GET MY PERMIT IN 3 DAYS!!!! WHOOT WHOOT!!! And I drove a lot today...(illegally, but hey, little details...) and it went well, so i'm a happy camper. Well, I'm not a camper, unless my life is a camp, which sometimes I think it is. Boot Camp. How much can you handle at once, like hopping on one foot reciting the alphabet backwards at the same time while writing an English report, learning new French verb tenses for the exam, and saving a small third world country?  But anyway, that's not why I'm posting here either. I'm going to drive you crazy yet...  I'm posting to say that I'm sick to death of everything that goes on after one wins the UVM writing contest. Today, i was pulled out of lunch and the first ten minutes of ocial Studies to do an over-the-phone interview with a guy from the Rutland Herald. it took, I am not kidding you, half an hour. He wanted to know EVERYTHING!!! What the prompts were, what I wrote, what my hobbies were, what I wanted to major in college in, if I had anything I was writing on the side, if I was publishing it, what i had to eat for lunch exactly five months ago, and what my views on Capital Punishment are. (Haha.) Well, it was close to that, you can imagine. :P  I am so ready for this to be over. O-V-E-R! Realizing I don't LIKE to be noticed. That 'invisable girl' syndrome. It dies hard.  I smell like linament from the stable. Kinda weird. I went to blow my nose, and I was permeated by the smell of mint, and it made my nose tingle really weirdly. Ugh.   I think I'll be on all night. I have an English paper to write, (anyone know of a really important day in my life, cause I can't think of one...) and a French compostion. To do in three different verb tenses. Ah, for the days of only the present tense...i think i need to find an on-line translator...make my life easy. Hahaha...  As always, Mischief AKA: Carissa

Well if I can entertain myself for another hour and a half I can go ahead to work. You guys better take good care of Nathan up there! Or I'll have to float up in my invisible car that runs on love, right Nathan! Anyway I everyone is having a good summer so far, and that you guys aren't as bored as I am.

      Okay so you guys don't know who I am for the most part. Well nice to meet you all. My name is Susannah, I'm 19 and I live in Durham, NC. (Don't you always feel stupid talking about yourself) Anyway, I am out of highschool and currently work as a waitress at an adorable pizzaria. I'm a vegetarian, I'm outspoken, I talk to much, and I can get annoying. On the good hand though, I'm loyal, compassionante, and understanding. I like theatre, and have been dong it for 15 years, I am a middle child and I know the muffin man.....sorry I had to add that. I'm a little starnge, and "special" but aren't we all. Anything else you want to know go ahead and ask.  -Susannah

      Lately ive been thinking theoretically and philisophicaly alot about dating and relationships and other things.  I think some people want a perfect boyfriend/girlfriend and since that doesnt happen much the person tends to make someone they find they like a little perfect to them.  So my question is would you, personally, make a person change their ways, habits, looks, whatever to your version perfect person?   The answer to my own question is no.  I will accept the person for who they are, thats why i fell in love with them anyway isnt it? Personally im willing to accept a persons bad habits. No matter how bad they might be.  No one is perfect, and as  urlLink Susannah  said, "being perfect would be an imperfection." I'm assuming this posts comments will be more than alot of others, and people? dont argue in the comments please? Thanks  I can already smell vermont everyone.  -Nate A.K.A the mish mash balley smash tik-in-tash car crash

      Here's a quote from earlier today:    Mischief1689: It's like, destiny on crack.   Ever get that feeling, like fate's been smoking the wacky tabacky? I've been getting that feeling a lot lately. It either go stupidly well, or horribly wrong. It was wrong, now it's getting good. So, as I have stated, destiny either needs to lay off the coke, or become an addict. Not inbetween. Inbetween makes me all confuzzled.   I think I'm going on a posting craze today. This is my forth post today. Isn't that sad?  Nora, if you're visiting from over where the say  miff  and  tiff  , here's this for you: Wasn't it,: Give Me Back My Handbag, Bitch?  Har har har...

      I think we've all generally come to the conclusion that being a teenager just...well...it SUCKS.   thankfully, the entire population of the world, over the age of 13, shares this knowledge.  and the entire population of the world over the age of 20 has survived being a teenager.  all the nasty embarrassing moments, all the horrible heart breaks, all the weird and unflattering styles and fads that we choose to or choose not to participate in, all the crazy mood swings - they all survived it.  They've even learned to laugh about it.  Seeing all these adults who survived teenager-hood makes me realize that, as unlikely as it seems, it really does get better.  so hang in there children, we've got lots to look forward to! *wheee*

      It is the most beautiful and wonderful thing, but there is a dark side, a side we do not see. The side of when the love is gone, the absence of it and the fear you have that one day you will have to endure that absence. I fear I will not be strong enough. I sit and realize that 18 hrs away is driving me mad as I sit here alone watching tv, playing games, reading, making jewelry, eating, pacing, anything to keep me busy. It is funny that in me a know that I don't NEED Nathan to the point that it is a bad thing but I also know the luxury of seeing the world in color, instead of black and white and now when I go back to the mediocre past in which I once inhibited I am falling apart. I sit alone here, I can't turn to Jessica who is in Connecticut with Justin, I cannot turn to my parents who are in Arizona or my sister who is with them, not even my other sister who is with her love in Ohio. The world is suddenly empty and my house so large and spacious. Of course the dogs keep me company but it isn't the same. I guess I should go out to stay busy and go shopping or go just join the world but the world is a scary place and instead I sit hear in hopes that the phone will ring and Nathan will be on the other line telling me he thinks of me. I know he thinks of me all the time but I never tire of hearing about it. I should be being productive and cleaning or sorting or something but instead I sit in constant despair until my other half has returned. I need to sign up for some art classes or make more friends to fill but time. It is funny I am so alone now and bored but in just 2 days my family will return and I will be full of not a lonely but a chaotic pain. I will suffer the intolerable cruelty of listening to my family quarrel and my sister will be sad at some point and though I try to console her as does my mother then there is my father who just breaks down sometimes and gets so frustrated that I am reminded of crying in my room when I was 6 years as I heard my mother cry and I wished I could do something. Nathan is my prince charming and has come to save me, but this isn't a fairy tale and though I can pray that the ending will be happy I will still have this pain. Then there is my mother who has no one to turn to. She was so stressed this May her blood pressure got to 210 over something and I had to take her to the hospital. I worry, she watched her father die from a heart attack her there, and I don't want to see her suffer, she needs a shoulder to cry on, but so do I. No wander I go to therapy once a week, but anyone who goes knows that it never seems to be at the time you need it, for some reason the moments that you encounter your physciatrist/phsycologist is one of the moments in the week that you are ok. And so now I cry as I set down the phone, I hoped it was Nate but instead it's the Democratic part calling for donations. Can someone tell me why life is the way it is, I wish everyone could just give and be kind but instead we have hate and pain and sorrow, and it eats me up inside. But yet I hate to sit here and cry because then I am hurting the one person who brightens every moment without effort and I hurt my Nathan, for when I cry he feels my pain and then that hurts him and it hurts me more, but I hold back my tears and smile to know that he is happy so s once again am I. For if I dwell in sorrow I bring him it would only bring him more sorrow and thus continue this painful circle. I will see him in 2 hours most likely but it is never enough, I feel so greedy, and needy but I guess that is who I am, I just hope it is good enough, not for the world but for Nathan. It is hard, no matter how much I heal and continue I hold these scars in my soul and will carry them, because in reality dropping all of my baggage and sorrow would mean starting again and that is even scarier, because even though it may be less painful somehow this painful world is comforting because it is what I have always known. Yet I love it when it is gone when I am in Nathans arms and there are no troubles, the weight is gone, and for those moments I am truly happy, I guess I am just terrified of the thought that this feeling that I realize is more than any other I have ever felt could one day end and that is terrifying. It is scary to admit it but when I look back on everyone I have ever been with thought I loved or even perhaps did love, it was nothing like this, not even if I took what I had to them and put it to the 100th power would it compare to this to the way it feels when my lips touch Nathan and I feel him quiver in my arms and I know for that moment why we are here, why the world is so hard, because in fact this love is here. So if by chance it is all gone when I woke up tomorrow, this month and a half with Nathan in my life would have made years of suffering worthwhile but I don't want to go back ever, not now that I am here. Why would someone leave heaven to endure hell, thats the way it feels, I would never give this up, I would sooner throw all my possesions out the window and run away from it all then give up this feeling give up this love this passion that has taken me over. I sit here and type, I tell myself to stop but I can't express it not in a million words. I want to come one and just say what I've been up to but am overwhelmed with this feeling to share with the world the hope that exists that is there. So for those of you who have endured and read my long and senseless ranting take with you these words of advice, whatever pain you have undergone and continue to undergo there is hope there is love, when there is war and hate and murder there is love and hope so never give up, dream and enjoy every second because on one day you will look back and those little moments like singing along in the car and feeling awkward because you know your voice cracks and the person next to you can't take it, remember those moments are the moments we live for, those are the true moments that we truly LIVE.

      We need a waltz on here...I mean, c'mon, everyone needs to dance. And I'm in an incredibly silly mood.  blame the Monty Python overdose last night...but anyway. I also find it funny that the (only) one who DOESN'T know how to waltz is posting a *ahum* waltz. But yes,...sillyness.  [begins dancing...oops, no music yet...oh well...CARRY ON!!!]  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (and uh, one, and uh, two, and a three...) POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (one...two...three...four...) POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST. (oh, you get the hint by now!)  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST.  PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-POST!!! (exhuberent dancing ensues.)  Ok...maybe I don't waltz. Maybe I just leap around. But hey, someone only tried to teach me once. And when it's Nord...more just a matter of making sure you don't get stepped on/step on her.   Ahum...NORA COMES HOME FROM LONDON TODAY!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!  So now...go out and dance in front of people until they stare at you. It's fun!!!  Ta, Mischiefness!!!!

THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am going to contact my attorney ( whitney )   and we are going to GET YOU AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA      Wheaton AKA the one who says "mibble"

      so wheaton's new word is "mibble".  He yells it during gameplay of  urlLink Puzzle Pirates  and other games like Unreal Tournament.  Muchly good games.  Puzzle pirates is especially fun though UT is violent (Rated "M" for mature, 18+ years).  I enjoy both of them very muchly.   I THINK I HAVE JUST OFFICIALLY SAVED THIS EXACT BLOG  Nate AKA SUPER BLOGGERMAN SAVER THINGy guy.

      I streaked my hair with blue wash out hair color and  i like it it's really cool! i wish it was permenent but it's not, it's a good thing i did it today or no one would have ever seen them. Someday i'm gonna dye my whole head some strange color with permenent dye and then grow it out i want to scare people i tried today but streaks aren't weird enough and they don't show up that great in my hair cuz my hair is darkish. i am continuing my hunt to find cheap converse all star high tops, so if anyone knows where they sell them cheaper than $40.00 tell me it will be apreciated.  Sonja: i am working on that story still but when i find a good palce to stop i'll send it to you. sorry about maybe having to move but hey Kanses is closer to VT then AZ is right! we had literature today fun fun fun, we started reading witness by Karen Hesse, we are doing it so that everyone in our class is portarying one of the characters since that is how it is written, it is really fun, i did my assignment that was due two weeks ago and read it actually i had two of them i only read one though.  I LOVE HAVING BLUE STREAKS IN MY HAIR!!!!! well i should go since i have stuff to do, i'm not exactally sure what but i have stuff to do see ya  - Haley Nicole Kenyon  (haha middle names are cool!)

YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I AM HAPPY I DON'T HAVE TO GET UP EARLY ON A MONDAY THIS WEEK, ok that's enough. i don't think anyone actually reads this, does anyone read this?  does anyone think that i should put stories and stuff that i write on here, or somewhere?

      THE STUPID AFTER SCHOOL PROGAM CAN ONLY HAVE 26 KIDS THERE, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE WHOLE MIDDLETOWN SPRINGS SCHOOL DICIDES THEY WANT TO TRY IT OUT? THERE ARE 50 SOMETHING KIDS IN THAT SCHOOL, SO, HOW CAN THEY DO THAT, I MEAN THATS LESS THEN HALF THE SCHOOL THAT THEY ARE LETTIN GO TO THAT AND IT'S FOR ALL THE KIDS IN MIDDLETOWN SO I MEAN REALLY, IT JUST MAKES ME MAD. Literature today i have to do my esay thing, but i think i have an idea for it, which is good. i don't want to do it though, i don't feel good, i'm worried about something, and thats why i don't feel good i hate my stupid nerves. I THINK I WAS MENT TO BE AN ELF, I HATE IDIOTS SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH, LIKE THE ONES WITH NO COMEN SENSE IT ANNOYS ME, AND JUST MAKES ME MAD, AND NORMALLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE ADULTS SO I DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO THEM AND AHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE NOT BEING BLUNT, OR BOLD OR ANY OF THAT, BUT IT WOULD BE RUDE IT I WAS TO ADULTS. no one is home here but me, my mom is shopping and my dad is working, and yea, we saw a play today, we meaning me rainbow, rosemary and cerridwen. it was cool, except for the fact that i didn't feel good through the whole thing cuz i was worried about some stupid thing. i almost went to middleberry with my mom, but i dicided on the last minute to go to the play and literuature. Rainbow, Cerridwen and i went in to essentel alternitives and they have these pins, they were soooooooooo funny one was "i only dress like this to scare the rebuplicans" and the one Cerridwen bought was "they need us more then we need them and they know it."  the one i wanted said  "Lets just say i pay no attention to athority." or something to that effect. there were a lot of good ones. "if the world didnt' suck we'd all fall off." should be a bumper sticker.   well i'll go now  Ta

We rode on the mule (not the animal a little golf cart kind of thing) it was fun, we play "mashed" and "Camped" fun stuff we just had fun.  but i am still tired.   well i'll go now

      'ello  I am so totally wiped out. Contra last night i danced with cerridwen twice and Laura ( i think) and waltzed with wheaton, and well walked around a lot and other stuff, i played Ultamate Frisbee with the homeschoolers today (for a little i was late and we ended not long after i got there) walked from the green to the asches (longer then it seems or shorter) had play practice, o and i stayed up really late last night because when i got home the comeaus and the crandells were here, and then i sat in bed until like 2:30 in the morning. PETE IS LACKING ENERGY BUT STILL GOOD!!! my back hurts i think i need to stand up stright more often if i can. I had lots of fun today no matter how wiped i am, it was awesome. My dad sat outside in the car for two hours waiting for us to get done with play practice since he wasn't smart enough to go in and ask how long it would be ARRRRRRRUUUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH. Well food awaits my presence good bye.  Love Haley

      What would you all do if i was a tomato? and would you still love me if i was a tomato?  We had play practice insted of chorus yesterday. and a biolagey test, i wonder how i did.....  anyway, our play practice went good, even thought the blocking was kind of messed up cuz we didn't have the music. but on the line part we were good. we are proforming at "the long school" aka long trail high school next week.  I  can't wait for summer since Sonja might be coming. I wish Britt could come for part of the summer but thats not going to happen it would be really cool though.  i found out that if i was a tomato, i would be eaten, squashed, and britt would freak out and only wheaton would love me if i was a tomato. but hey thats ok. i don't want to be eaten or squished.  i got the new pink cd from Emily G today, she burned it for me. Clavin thinks he could beat up Wheaton. *coughyea rightcough* of course i don't know if i can actually see either of them actually fighting, but it could happen.  I'm hungrey, and listening to my new cd, and well i guess i'm sorta bored.  Cerridwen fell down our stair last night, not fun. but we were laughing about it. she was laughing too i wasn't laughing at her or anything. she killed her tail bone.  The clock in the 6th grade class room this morning was upside down or as scotty put it "topsy turvy". well i guess i'll go find something to do.  O i got to go to contra on saturday, it was LOTS and LOTS o fun. I'll deffinitally go again.  Well bye.  Love,  Haley

      Hello,  Living history is weird, but fun i get to see Emily G everyday which is really cool since i don't see her very much. I might get to go to contra dance tomorrow if i can get a ride. It might not be my thing but hey it can't hurt to try, unless it can.  I didn't get to play my song at LH (living history) today like i should have been able too, but Malindi didn't either. i was in the biggest group too so............ Well i'm going to go find something to do.  Bye  Haley

      It is offically a year since my grandma Pat died tomorrow would have been her 88th birthday had she lived to her 87th. I miss her, a lot, i remember sitting outside in the car in the hospital parking lot at 11 something on march 16th 2003 when my mom and dad came out and i opened the door and my mom said "she died." and well i don't think i broke down or anything i mean i cried but i kinda didn't believe it i mean Gramma was sick lots of times and she always bounced back and the one time we really thought she was going to be ok since she wasn't all that sick when we went to Rhode Island for her birthday. she went in to a coma baiscally well the hospital people put her in a coma but still and then she died i couldn't go in the hospital and my parents didn't make me but i do remember sitting outside the hospital with my cousin and my other cousin's girlfriend. man it just sucks i miss her i miss watson well at least i have friends or at least i think i have friends  I love you all Haley

      A guy was driving when a policeman pulled him over. He rolled down his window and said to the officer, "Is there a problem, Officer?" "No problem at all. I just observed your safe driving and am pleased to award you a $5,000 Safe Driver Award. Congratulations. What do you think you're going to do with the money?" He thought for a minute and said, "Well, I guess I'll go get that drivers' license." The lady sitting in the passenger seat said to the policeman, "Oh, don't pay attention to him - he's a smartass when he's drunk and stoned." The guy from the back seat said, "I TOLD you guys we wouldn't get far in a stolen car!" At that moment, there was a knock from the trunk and a muffled voice said, "Are we over the border yet?"  There is this one and more away messages and jokes and stuff on www.iconator.com and no i didn't make that one up.

      Wow, today i found that no one actually looks at this, darn, that sucks, well actually Wheaton doesn't look at it , other people might, but then again Wheaton doesn't look at anyones unless he was lying to me. Cerridwen is becoming frusterating, she is using this character that i made up in her story, MY character MINE, i was O.K with it at first but now i'm kinda ify about it cuz she is kinda screwing up what my character does and stuff like that, i mean yea it's her story she can write it anyway she wants, but shouldn't i get a say too? should i?  I went to Math today at the Chila's it was ok, i'll go again, i have no literature homework i just have to re-write the thing i wrote last week cuz i don't like it, it won't be hard at all since i have an idea, don't ask me why i even bother updating it's not like anyone ever looks at this thing. right now i feel like no one cares what i say or anything in that sence, i mean even if i tell cerridwen i don't like her using my character she'll still use her, and i just well feel like depressed and like i need a hug and a reasuring word someone to tell me i am loved at that i have friends and that i'm not left out, i try to tell myself that but well it doesn't work. I feel like i'm missing something, i don't know what, just something, it's like all the other homeschoolers are so close and i'm on the outside looking in, it sucks. I miss Watson, and My Grandmother, and i almost feel like i'm going to cry.  on a lighter note THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE RETURN OF THE KING WON 11 OSCARS, YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! heres the list of what they won for Best Art Dircetion (yay! Best Director (yay peter jackson!) Best Costum Disign (O yea) Best Film editing (yea sure it's 3 hours and 15 minutes long) Best Make-up (YES YES YES, John Rhys Davies (Gimli) was algergic to his face prostecitcs)  Best Origonal Music Score (yay Howard Shore!)

      hey y'all,  I only have a few minutes to write so i'll sumerize fast I decided i should update before i turn into wheaton or sonja or brittanie the people who never update. Not that anyone cares. I've been writing too much lately, and not on this computer either, on the laptop which has no internet and in notebooks, and it's mostly been fanfiction about i movie i've never seen, well actually it's a new story same characters. I really don't know what's wrong with me. Casey has one of my cds and i have one of hers opps, we have to trade today, if we don't i'm going to well i'm not going to do anything. I'm stuck in a research group with Faith and Ali (SAVE ME) i think today will be the day Faith kills both of us. She has a worse adittude then me (if that's possible)  It's really warm today. I have pottary this afternoon, weeeeeeeeeee not. then i think i have nothing to do unless i can go to contra i really (really really really really really) hope so.  The horkans where here last week, with their friend Cassandra.  uhh and i think that's it, i should go get ready for living history. Love ya,  Speedy a.k.a the one who needs to stop writing or her computer won't be happy and all her creative juices will dry up.

I got a Johnny Damon T shirt ( it has his last name and number on th back) I got to hang out with Jeff, Rachel and Kirk for almost a week, which was lots of fun, we went to a bunch of diffrent beaches, got lost once. went shopping, and just had fun. The last night we were there we heard about a murder (maybe) that had happened that morning (or something like that) in the town we were staying in Rachel locked EVERY single lock on the front door (there's four one on the screen door and three on the regular door) THE RED SOX BEAT THE YANKEES.  "Get-er-dun" Thats Jeffs saying, and now it's THE saying of the 6 of us (my parents, Jeff, Rachel, Kirk, and I) I had fun, I'll see ya later.  Bye.

      I have a horrible nasty painful sore throat. owwwwwwwwwww.  i need a hug, i'm leaving on sunday, going to cape cod for a week, and on thrusday i'm going to boston and a red sox game YIPPIE OWWWWWWWW!!! remind me not to scream until my sore throat is gone.  I'm gonna miss all you people, you should know who you are, but if you don't thats ok too, you will be missed. I'm hoping to get 30.00 for cleaning my room and if i get it all the way done to day i get 35.00 yummy!! i bet i'll only get five though, but it's deffenitally better than nothing.  People really need to start reading this since i actually update it. I'm unloved *sniff* If you people want anything in boston or cape cod tell me (nothing expenesive a penny candy would be good) I found out that ten years ago yesterday Kurt Cobain's body was found in his green house.  But he killed himself on April 5th. For all you people who don't know who Kurt Cobain was: he was the lead singer of Nirvana, the punk/grunge/pop/rock band, they were really good. or at least i think so. He had tryed to kill himself a month before he actually did but it didn't work to well, his wife brought him to the hospital when she found him unconsious. I admire him oddly enough, he was INCREIDABLY talented. I read his Suicide note on the internet last night, and part of it said "for Frances for her lfe will be so much happier without me" Frances is his daughter.  well i'm leaving now see ya Love ya I'll miss ya when i go away,  Haley

      YO,  it's monday.....wow..already.....anyway, I went to the Farmhouse and saw a movie with some people (the squiers,Jeni, Caitlin, Sarah, Cerridwen,Rob, Carissa, Justine, Carson,i think thats it) we saw "Evelyn" good movie, "you want to steal our women, and our fish" funny too, but i think it was made better by the comments like "smack the nun, smack the nun" and "now that's my kind of nun"  and then there was the quote in the movie "just wait until i get you outside" which was from an older lady talking to a nun, it was good.  I had a pretty good day, i'm not sure i really learned anything (well not all that much anyway)  i talked to my neighbors (the evil nasty bad ones) in the deli without even knowing it was them stupid me i. they were nice though (it's just an act, thats what my parents are saying anyway.) i'm going now.  Love Haley

      I am mad.......my 13th birthday is this year, and now all of my dreams of having a party have gone down the drain. I can't have a surprise party because people i would want to be invited wouldn't be, but maybe if i had a surprise party people i want to be invited that my parents won't let me invite would be able to come.  I want to have a sleep over thing, like i have a party party at my house and then we go down to the horkans (they dont live there full time) and sleep over. But i can't invite guys i mean of course i'll live, but, but, but, god damit there are guys i'd want to invite. Good job crushin my dreams almost Six months before they happen mom and dad Great JOB.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH it probably would never have happened anyway but NOOOOOOOO they have to crush them now. DARN THEM.  well i'll go and rant to someone else.  Love ya,  Haley

I finally wrote Chelsea a letter back, it's been like two months, i'm just not motavated anymore, but at least i update my blog more then once a month unlike some people *coughwheatonandsonjacough* People are gonna lynch them if they don't up date i'm not saying names *coughmecough* i'm now working on putting quotes on my other blog (my third one)  I went to a b-day party for Dave Comeau last night, after going out to eat yummmmm.  Saw Wheaton on the green talked to him about what we would do if he ran out in front of my moms car so that i could beat her to the store, that was yesterday too.  Corinne and i wrote stuff on her mirror with lipstick last night, that was fun one of the things i wrote (that she told me to write) was "i see crandells they're everywhere" and as we were leaving the crandells pulled in i feel bad for corinne she had to face them alone poor her.  well i guess i'll go now.  see ya'll (maybe) Haley

      Well, we did our play in Fairlee, Vermont, it was fun, played ultamite frisbee with people we didn't know.  Cerridwen went with us, she slept over last night, we didn't stay up to late.  we found out that Wheaton basically has a frisbe radar he knows when people are playing frisbee.  i was the odd one out it was the only reason Cerridwen got to go, there was a extra person (not really they just didn't have enough seats) so i got to invite Cerridwen. i do wish that i could have rode with them but i didn't get to, it was sad.  I miss everybody now. and i have a song that i really don't know the words to stuck in my head. "oh no no no no veasta" hehe that's about all i know. well no i know most of the song i just can't under stand most of it.  "we come from the fire, living in the fire go back to the fire turn the world around."  that's a diffrent song we sung while we were getting ready to proform.  then we went around in a circle kissing each others checks...that was odd.  and we did some other stuff including: "the big birdes fly up in the sky, while down in the nest the little birdes rest with a wing on the left and a wing on the right, the little birdes sleep all through the night. SHH YOU MIGHT WAKE UP THE BIRDES, The sun rises up the dew goes away good morning good morning the birdes all say."  that gets people really hyper!! We got to answer questions too, that was interesting.  Monday is the first day of living history (setting up) it starts at....8:00 or 8:30 AM and ends and 7:30 or somewhere around there.  Tuesday is the "acting out" day. and the cruise...i wonder if there are and homeschoolers going on the cruise (besides jake eli cerridwen and i)  i think this is long enough...well see ya.  Love, Hugs.  Haley, o yea....for some reason i really miss all the other homeschoolers today. i saw a squier van, and i saw robin, but no kids...humph..o and i saw Cerridwen...but still.  it sucks because i won't be able to be at classes on monday....i need hugs!!! well love ya,  Haley

      OK Living History isn't all that much fun anymore...there is NO way that my documentary group is going to finish the project on time...yuck. Ok we might, but we need to get on a certin computer that has all of our pictures on it, and it needs to run 5 mins not including credits it runs like a minute or so...and with our filming it will run around two, but we need to add a LOT to get it to be long enough. i don't know if it's going to happen.  I'm probably going to miss math...again.  we have to do the play on friday....in Fairle which is two hours away.  i want the cheesecake brownie that is in my kitchen right now, since i am still somewhat hungry, i need it....ok uhhh that's done with.  i don't really have anything to say except: I keep the LOTR Characters ina hat, that sits next to me everywhere i go.  ok i'm leaving now.

      God, i can't even figure out my life anymore. I miss Watson, and my Grandma Pat. I have way too much to do, and the most selfish thing (that i am doing) is that i'm mad because my parents won't let me do stuff i feel horrible for a multitude of reasons i want to go to casey and corinne's and vent cuz they are the only ones who will listen but i can't my dad doesn't want to go back. Jackie's dog Keetna is probably going to get put to sleep i've known that dog since they got her (i think) i'm realizing my life has been screwed up since march of last year.  I need hugs. I need to know that someone actually cares about the fact that i'm have mental breakdowns over here.  i'm crying as i'm typing and i honestly have no idea why.  i know i can't go to Casey and Corinne's but i really want to.  i have to admit i'm depressed for stupid reasons, but really i wouldn't call it depression it's more of a mental breakdown/depression/stress. and it's all brought on by stress. i want someone to just sit by me with their arm around me and comfort me cuz god knows my parents won't.  I really need a hug, a real one would be good. i feel so little. i really need a friend.  i'm way too stressed out. i have a history report due monday, living history tues-fri history on mon, biology on mon, art on mon , chorus on mon, liturature on wed, math on wed pottary on fri.....i only have one day to write my report...i have to clean my room..... god this sucks i HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want my real life back, the one i used to have when stuff was fun.  o and after all of the other stuff i have to keep up with my school work by doing math every week day.... i want my life.  i need a hug. someone give me a hug or at least comment that would be nice.  well i guess i'll go cry to myself in front of the computer somemore.

      Why is it that the only people who ever call just to talk to me are Casey and Corinne Comeau? and why is it that i don't normally get e-mail from the people i want to get e-mails from? AHHHHHHH someone should call me just to talk to me someday does everyone know the number? god i feel so alone waaaaaaa. the person who e-mails me the most is Cerridwen. but still it's nice to hear from other people too.  NO BODY LOVES ME!!!!!!!!!!  does anybody love me?  i'm typing my new favorite song here, you can enjoy  "i wanted you to know that i love the way you live I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph i know it does me well  I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Cuz i'm broken when i'm lonesome and i don't feel right when your gone away your gone away you don't feel me here anymore The worst is over now and we can breath again i wanna hold you high and steal my pain away there's so much left to learn and no one left to fight i wanna hold you high and steal your pain.  cuz i'm broken when i'm open and i don't feel like i am strong enough  cuz i'm broken when i'm lonesome and i don't feel right when your gone away."- Seether featuring Amy Lee "Broken"   some how i can realte it to my life right now...i don't know why.  I got to go to contra it was AWESOME.... Wheaton owes me a dance....and he had better remember it too, or i WILL lynch him, just kidding.  so if anyone ever wants to call me to just talk then do it, i have nothing better to do then talk on the phone or computer, or write all of which i can do at the same time, yay for multitasking.  well see ya  Love,  Haley

      Solarfest is all over and done with until next year (we hope) i slammed my legs in to some roots trying to go off the rope into the water, they hurt, hung out with Carissa, hung out with Sarah Coffmen (whom i haven't seen in a year)found out that she is depressive, but i still love her.  played lots of frisbee, had a lot of fun. i love solarfest, i really do.  i did have to help set up thursday and friday, and i had to help strike last night (stike meaning clean up, make a lot of solarfest stuff go away) although most of the time that was happing i was throwing frisbe's with people i didn't know, it was lots of fun though.  i am wipped out, from 4 days of being on me feet, i slept until 11 past 11 this morning and i'm still really tired. i am going to go find free food, since i've been paying and giving meal tickts for two days.  ta.

      Project Oculus is really getting on my nerves!  If I explaned what was happening, you wouldn't understand what I meant.  So far I've been working on trying to get the Mac.  I'm going to try the PC in a minute...  Grandma Tremmel: I will get your Monet picture on the site as soon as the company that made the reader for the card comes out with drivers for Mac OS X.2.  If they don't have when I'm looking today, I'll use my PC and transfer it to the map.  Look here if I have posted it.  Well, hope you people will email me.  See you later!!

      I'm having trouble uploading things to the website.  I'm lucky getting this uploaded. It's something the matter with Mindspring's servers.  I had the PC's webcam working, but due to the server problems it won't work right now.  Sorry for the inconvenience(and sorry for the bad spelling)!

      Did I ever tell you how much Windows sucks?  Of course I'm talking about the Windows operating system(s).  For the Tremmel's side, you've never experienced the horror of what I like to call "Whinedows".  I made the horrible mistake of buying one.  It wasn't a new one(ebay) and it was the worst product I've ever got.  Sure, I might be a little biased because I've used Macs for so long.  but I've found Windows to be un-operatable.  Have to restart Windows.  Blog ya later!

      There are many things that make Windows unstable.  Some programs can cause it.  Registry "hacks" can cause it. Too many things can cause.  I find if you use  urlLink Trillian  with certain skins can cause windows to, essentially, to freeze the screen.  I have also found that if you open a couple programs and some windows (at least in windows 98) it does the same thing.  If you have a couple CPU-hog programs open and some windows it causes a slow response to your actions or worse a " urlLink blue screen of death ." Unfortunatly, there is no way to avoid them if you have a pc.  But you just have to but up with them.  I hope to build myself a nice computer(PC) whenever I have some.  But right now I have no money... I've bookmarked everything I need to build it.  Of course I will never be able to scrounge up enough money.  Why do We have to have money it just gets in the way.  But if you know of a quick way to get $600-800, let me know.  See you later!

      The power just flickered.  You may not know how annoying that is, until you loose power right in the middle of writing in your  urlLink blog .  Or some other thing that you can't or forgot to save.  Now I was saying in the previous version of this exact blog entry that we've had a very unusual winter.  I may put a very secure password setup on the pictures pages.  If I can I'll need a password, so  urlLink E-mail  me your ideas.  I'm thinking of finding another program like the program I'm using on the pc to show you the mac.  The iMac 17' did come it is fast and  sssssoooooo beautiful .  See you later!

      It seems to be everywhere, but if you didn't know today marks the 5th year since the  urlLink cancellation of the Newton ,  urlLink Apple's  first PDA.  The Newton (as I've heard) was ahead of its time.  It apperently had great handwriting recongniton, compared to most modern  urlLink PDA's.  Tech Geeks will always remeber the Newton, may Apple build another.

I like to think of those notes as newsletters.    And if any of you were wondering, everything down here is just fine.  The iMac is great.  The Dell is..........the dell. Yeah.

      You may have noticed my recent blogs have been a little informative(by the way i've had 3 blue screens today and windows has crashed 3 times) technology wise.  I'm just trying to pass along information that I learn from  urlLink Techtv  to you guys.  I've also said it because I have no family news.  But would you rather have me say something or say nothing for years.

      Well now I'm going to show you what my  urlLink start menu  looks like. After it got to be two columns of junk i decided to make folders for different things.  Of course I never look in the folders so i never see the programs.  And if I don't see the program immediatly I don't remember that its even on my computer.  By the way, I did that with a trick.  For windows if you press "Print Screen" on your keyboard, it takes a picture of your whole screen.  Us Mac users have a couple more options: to take a picture of the whole screen hold down command,shift, and 3, for a selected portion of the screen hold down command, shift, 4 and choose your space; and if you want a picture of a chosen window select the window and press command, shift, 4, and caps lock.

      There is a alternative to Windows(and Mac OS but X is based on it).  I wouldn't recommend it to any of you people, because I can barely use it myself.  It's called Linux, and I think it's pretty cool.  The only way I could say this is it's not user-friendly.  It's ment for system administrators and servers, but I have it on my Dell.  I don't use it much because it's hard to install programs(like I said it's not user-friendly).  I'm not the only one that has Linux on their home system.  There are many others.  And they use it more than I do.   Windows has entrapped me.  I use it way too much.  Looking at it then Mac OS X is painful.  Mac is so beautiful.  Windows is boxy,clunky.  It kills me to use it so, but I can't stop.  Maybe theres a group...   Dad doesn't like it either.  but he has the choice.  He has both in his office (and uses one keyboard,monitor and mouse) and he never uses the PC.  It's a backup for another computer anyways.  I'm glad he doesn't, because he'd be stressed all the time.  Maybe I should just leave it at Linux and get rid of Windows all together.  It's tempting, and It wouldn't be able to play the new games.  I want to build a gaming computer, so I could make the Dell a Linux box(as they call it).  I wonder when I'll be able to build my gaming computer....   I need to give my gaming PC project a name.  I can't decide.   urlLink Email  me with your ideas!!   I've made the site very interactive.  I tell you to email me ideas and all that, yet none of you talk to me.   WHY???????????????

      Have I mentioned that I hate windows? I guess if you do nothing to it like add almost ANY  of the programs I have on it.  It is not happy.  You could open anything and it will give you a blue screen of death.  And now it has to be reinstalled because I unistalled shockwave and it doesn't like that i guess.  It feels good to put your anger in a blog.  Otherwise I'd be throwing the Dell out the window.  I don't care what its doing or complaning about now.  I'm on the 17" iMac and I'm listening to music and I'm happy.  I'd be happier if the game companies would make ALL games compatible with Mac's.  Why can't we get along!?!?    Well I have the whole week off for spring break.  My intentions for this week are to put Windows 2000 on the Dell(its supposedly more stable and secure than 98, But I never want to hear the words "windows" and "stable in the same sentence unless theres a not in the sentence).  The rest of the time I'll sleep.   By the way, Microsoft has for a long while said they are no longer supporting Windows 98, so moving to 2000 actually is a good idea.   Time to change the subject.  I guess I'm a little biased about my operating system of choice since I've been using Mac for a long while.  But many novice windows users who have not used macs in there life think it sucks too.  I don't think of myself as a novice Windows user.  I mean, alot of people call in people to fix their computer.  I do it myself.  It's been tempting to do the same, but it feels better if you do it yourself...

      Let me fill you in. Here is the defintion of a blog:  On a Web site, a blog, a short form for  urlLink weblog , is a personal journal that is frequently updated and intended for general public consumption. Blogs generally represent the personality of the author or the Web site and its purpose. Topics sometimes include brief philosophical musings, commentary on Internet and other social issues, and links to other sites the author favors. The essential characteristics of the blog are its journal form, typically a new entry each day, and its informal style. The author of a blog is often referred to as a blogger. People who post new journal entries to their blog may often say they blogged today, they blogged it to their site, or that they still have to blog. For more information, see weblog.

      That's right, I got it!!!  In fact, I got it as were   going to the beach.  I also got a game for it: The Legend of Zelda, A link to the past.  It's cool (the game and the SP). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beach trip was nice.  It was freezing cold most of the time (because of the wind).  But on Monday (the day we left) it was pretty nice and me, Grandpa, and my dad played tennis.  It was fun.  Colin was in the indoor pool most of the time we were there.  We played mini golf and Dad won.  It was fun anyways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well it was fun, but I missed my computers :-(  I think I should have a laptop.  I want a Mac and PC laptop.  I didn't miss the pc THAT much but I've started to grow fond of it after getting Windows 2000.  By the way if you want to be brave and try Linux, try buying  a copy of  urlLink Knoppix .  It doesn't touch your computer, it boots from the cd.  Isn't that cool?!  Unfortunatly, it does not work for Mac.  In fact, I've had trouble burning it to CD from the iMac.  There's a new version of w.bloggar, so I'll have to get it after I finsh this blog. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really like blogging, it gives you a place to talk about whatever.  This is my thoughts and mine alone.  It's like a diary, except its online and everyone can see it.  It gives me a place to let out my anger of Windows out.  Eventhough after getting Windows 2000, it is looking pretty nice.  I guess its just I got this Dell with Windows 98 and it crashed so much.  Leo Laporte (host of Call for Help and The Screen Savers) got a lawn mower.  He was thinking about either getting a pc or mac laptop and settled on a lawn mower.  urlLink "Nothin runs like a Deere".

      Today,  urlLink Apple  announced two new products/features to their great line of products.  The first one is this,  the new  urlLink iPod   You may have heard of the old iPod, but this new one makes the old ones (and I quote from Walt Mossberg on The Screen Savers tonight) "look like whales".  The new ones are SOOOOOOO thin!!  I know it's hard to do on dial-up, but theres a link on the page that says take it for a spin.  Look at it.  Ain't it beautiful?  I can't stop gaulking over it.   I know I know, I have one.  But this new one is AWESOME.  I absolutly love it.  And for non-Mac users, they have Windows versions.  Of course you need a firewire(IEEE 1394) port but you can put a firewire card in your current machine.  As I write this, I can't get my mind of the little thing!!!  I guess I should mention the other feature Apple annouced today that they have a music store.  This is where you buy music on itunes in this case.  Totally legal. $.99 per song, $10 for an album.  But I don't feel like talkin' 'bout it anymore.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE IPOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THAT THING ROCKS!ROCKS!ROCKS!ROCKS!

       Dad gave me a good idea yesterday.  Melody (my aunt on Dad's side) should get  urlLink VNC  on her computer.  You may not know this, but Melody is the only other person to have high speed internet (DSL or Cable; she has  urlLink Vermontel DSL , we have  urlLink Time Warner Cable's Road Runner ).   (Quoted from urlLink  Versiontracker.com ):"What is VNC? - A practical introductionVNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote display system which allows you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine architecture"   So I could control her computer to fix any problems she is having.  I could also use it on you dial up users, but I dont wanna.  She could also control my computers if she wanted to.  But there is this one problem over here, the router won't let her.  I'll work on it.   Speaking of routers, Melody if your reading this you should get a router, too.  A router would allow both the computers to access the internet at the same time.  Right now I'm downloading something on my iMac, putting an update on the new iMac, and writing this very thing on the Dell.  By the way, if you want a mac-friendly router, we have a  urlLink Netgear  one.  Talk to my Dad about what routers to get.  And you still get to use the phone and have the same blazing speed of DSL. I'm defragging my Hard Drive right now and my computer is non-responsive.  I've got to let it alone, so I'll stop writing now.

      Not only do I have my eye on the new  urlLink iPods  ,  I want one of those on your right.  It's Apple's non-G4 processor based laptop the urlLink  iBook.   It's also their cheaper of the two laptop systems they have out (the other is the  urlLink G4 PowerBook ).  The iBook matches with my iPod, and I like it a little better than the PowerBooks (and I have touched and seen the PowerBooks in person) because of it's simplicity.  The iBook looks a little simpler than the PowerBooks.  And the iBooks  urlLink Airport  signal is a little better than the PowerBook Titanium's.  But I don't know how to get the money... Compared to the PowerBooks cost, the low end iBook is very inexpensive.  The bottom line iBook is $999.  I WANT ONE ALONG WITH THE iPOD!!  I've been bugging my dad to death about it.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, school is over for this year.  I have mixed emotions about it.  I happy to be out of  urlLink Stanford  and on to Orange High , but sad about the friends that will be going to  urlLink Cedar Ridge  or somewhere else.  One of my teachers and I have started emailing each other, so I'll still have a connection to Stanford. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very siked today because  urlLink waldo  is coming home.  I'm also exited because of the fact that we are going to Vermont next Monday!!!!  I will still have a way to connect to Blogger (the only way I could have this blog) and talk to you guys.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think some of you guys should get an  urlLink AOL Instant messenger  screename.  Me and dad talk to each other that way instead of a long distance phone call (it shouldn't be long distance-its one county away!), and its free! But still instant message me if you have it.  If you want my screename,  urlLink email me  (I do this as a security precaution in case anyone that's not supposed to be looking at the site get my screename and IM me to death)! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't wait to see you guys up North!  I'm ready to go NOW.  I just need waldo...  Anyone know where waldo is?  Where's waldo? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, You guys could see me if I decided to buy a webcam.  Those things are cool.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope everyones well and good and happy.  I'll be happy when I see waldo.     REMEBER: I'll be updating the pages that don't look the same, so keep a look out!

          You've probably noticed that the  urlLink pictures  pages look NOTHING alike and not even close to the other pages.  Anyways I'll be working on it as I move towards the north to Vermont, with the help of " urlLink waldo ", also known as an aluminum 12' Powerbook G4 laptop.     Speaking of Vermont, I guess I'll have to delete my  urlLink screenshots  (the pictures were outdated anyways) of the old iMac, for it is going to Melody.  But maybe those pictures will be changed to the desktop a  urlLink different machine ...

      I thought about it, and figured since we have a laptop I will write in the blog of our location when ever I possibly can.  I plan to use  urlLink NetStumbler (on mac, MacStumbler) .  It sniffs out wireless networks.  I wonder if there  is  any wireless networks on the highway?  I'll tell you if I find one.

        If you don't know, my whole family is driving to Vermont on June 9th.  We will get to see my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.  It will be fun.  Especially because we will have waldo (a powerbook G4) and our old iMac to give to Melody.    See that thing to your right? That's the  urlLink Zero Blaster , and I got mine today.  It shoots fog rings, and is really cool.  If you guys up north want me to bring it,   urlLink Email me !

      Yesterday,  urlLink Apple  had their urlLink  keynote  at urlLink  WWDC .  And I was very pleased at the look and the features of  urlLink Mac OS X.3: Panther .  I especially like the  urlLink Fast User Switching , where you can change accounts without quiting applications in the current login.  And  urlLink Expos , which allows you find a window without moving all the windows on your screen.  I like the look of the new  urlLink Finder ,  which looks very nice.  And they now have  urlLink iChat AV , which allows you to use instant messaging and a webcam to LET YOU SEE THE PERSON YOUR TALKING TO.  And ALL this is ONLY in Mac OS X: Panther!!  So Get a Mac OS X machine!!! Speaking of OS X machines, Steve Jobs patetend "one more thing" showed us the new  urlLink Powermac G 5  .  It is the fastest personal computer in the world!!!  Beat that Windoze!!  They also announced a camera for iChat AV, called  urlLink iSight .  I WANT ONE OF THOSE.  Its a webcam and its nice.  BUT YOU MUST HAVE MAC OS X AND ICHAT AV!!  Start crying Windoze users!!

       Well, I'm back from Vermont.   It was really fun, and when with Melody, Marshall, Meadow, Rainbow, Wheaton, you have to work.  I drove a tractor, and a truck.  We bailed hay, picked rocks, and raised a barn.  But even with that, it was fun. We set up and fixed there computers, and now they have the old iMac.  And hopefully I will get an iBook.  But still we have the new iMac and the Dell.  Tommarow I have to surrender waldo:-(.  So I'm back, all the kids in Tinmouth have their own email addresses, and I got to see my cousins(and drive a tractor and a truck).

       urlLink    I spent about 3-5 minutes looking at this little box on my  urlLink Windows 2000  machine.  I was trying to get pictures of my iPod and my win machine off the camera to the server.  Apparently Windows 2000 thinks you should have this hardware plugged in all the time so it doesn't have to look for it's drivers.  Of course Windows would do this.  Just like they leave ports that people could hack you with OPEN with a standard install of Windows 2000 or XP.  I don't know why they would do this, just no possible reason why.  Microsoft, could I have a word with you?  Tell your "big man" that he should check over things before he sends it out (a.k.a Windows).  This way we don't have to worry about installing updates for windows when it comes out for.... oh lets say at least a week after you send out your new windows OS?  could we do that please?  And make it a little prettier.  Thanks.   Of course my real letter to Microsoft wouldn't sound at all like that.  Everyone says I should give windows a chance.  Wheaton says its "awesome"  of course he just wants it for the games.  He's never seen the problems I have.  I could crash this thing right now if I wanted to.  A word of advise:  BEFORE YOU BUY  ANYTHING , DOUBLE THINK IT.  Thank you.  (this goes double for any Microsoft products) Now I gotta look at that box for another 3-5 minutes. (by the way, that picture is a link.  Click on it too see my whole desktop!)

NNNNNNOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, its started, I actually want to get back to school.  I'm getting bored of everything.  I need a new  urlLink PS2  or  urlLink GBA  game....   urlLink SOMETHING!!!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new, cool thing to do these days in the blogging business is Moblogging (Mobile+blogging=Moblog).  This is where you have a cell phone with built in camera and take pictures of whatever you please.  urlLink  Chris Pirillo ,who used to be on Techtv and urlLink  Leo Laporte  of Techtv's The Screen Savers and Call for Help(yes, thats 2 shows for your Leo loving pleasure) have done Moblogs.  It's pretty cool.  I'd do it if I had a cell phone and actually get out of the house once in a while.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was on strange banana(again)   I found another  urlLink web page idea  I may put in the site at another time.

If you have downloaded songs at any time and are sharing them, you could be on the urlLink  list of The RIAA's most wanted . It doesn't just apply to KaZaa, if you use Limewire, eMule, etc. you will be subpeonaed too.  Do us all a favor, and stop.  Unistall any of those programs, delete the songs, AND GO BUY THE ALBUM ON CD!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to know the consequenses, and the subpeoena?  A charge of  $100,00 A SONG!!!!  .   urlLink Look at the EFFs page on how not to get sued by the RIAA . KaZaa, Limewire, etc. all of illegal songs on them.  Don't download them, buy them.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to my newest tech gadget.  Its the  urlLink Sony Clie Sj22 .  It's a PDA.  Unfortunatley I can't tell you much about how it handles now because It's not supposed to come till September 16, 2003.  So I'm waiting in agony for it to come.  I can't take it much longer.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, its got a nice color screen, jog wheel and Sony memory stick slot.  It's pretty nice.  Even though its the bottom-of the line Sony Clie model.  I'll tell you more when I get it.  You can get a camera for it, too.  And a game controller.  It runs on the palm os so most games and apps that run on the palm os will run on this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing will hopefully allow me to rember things I need to get done.  As well as people's birthdays.  So  be expecting emails saying happy birthday from me when your birthday comes.  PDA's are quite handy things to have. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way all you mac fans, The newest version of Mac OS X, codenamed Panther, will be here very soon.  Apple has put a ticker on their front page telling when you can buy it.  From what I hear, it will be AWESOME.  Mac users that can handle os X: get it.  PC users: SWITCH IMMEDIATLY!!!!!

        HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  I had a very unproductive new years day.  Pretty much all day watching tv and playing with our (me and my brother's)  urlLink Xmods .  Did you happen to know that they now have 15 minute and 30 minute rechargable batteries?  This is a big improvement to say, 4 hour chargers.  We use them in the formentioned xmods.  Its nice because then we can play with them without waiting for as long a time.  Pretty fun.  Plus marathons on tv of like everything.  I chose an educational show (not really) to watch that was a marathon. It talked about myths(they tested the myths youve heard and blah blah blah blah) and when i got bored with that(and had seen the show before) i played with the xmods.  they go fast      yup, sure do. Have i told you to look at the post "Need I say more"?  I like it.    oh, and as I end every post (until after my birthday) stuff you could by for my  urlLink birthday .

        We got a new dishwasher today!!! Yay!!!  This is a big thing because our old one was falling apart(last time we used it, which was very recently, it spilled water and didnt clean the top rack at all: the top had a bunch of still dirty dishes); not to mention that a amazon  urlLink cardboard box .  The old one has had better days.  And now we welcome the new one, and its  urlLink load capacity .        We like it very much and it is pretty quiet compared to the old one.  We like it so far....        Family: stuff you could  urlLink buy  for my birthday

            urlLink NO SCHOOL TODAY OR TOMMAROW !!!  These silly people at the dot cant handle 3-5 in of snow and ice, so they panic and cancel school.  So I didnt have school today and wont have school tommarow.  Silly people.  And unfortunatly people decide to drive and get hurt or die.  The emergency rooms are full of people unfortunatly.       Ah well at least i get to not have school.

        Oh boy wheaton got his new computer and I spent a bit of time waiting(there was a bit of lag) and through the miracles comes....                     A Wheaton boy over the computer!!! This is done with Apple's wonderful program known as  urlLink iChat AV .      Then, of course, there is the webcams, these are not the isights, but they are ADS  urlLink Pyro 1394 Webcams (for both of us).  It is awesome.  Most of you know we dont get to see each other much, and now we do!!!      See what Apple does for you?

      So did anyone watch the superbowl? I didn't.  However, some  urlLink commercials  during the superbowl were awesome.  So I think I'll start buying some sierra mist now.  I already bought the song off of iTunes Music Store.  The one that they sing. Yeah.  Oh common, its only $.99, $9.99 for most albums.  Sorry anyone not on Windows 2000 or XP, but you shouldnt be using anything below anyways, but you cant get itunes either.

      I have been toiling over a hot computer for a little while, first with the  urlLink Community Blog , then with changing all of how my windows looks and feels.  I used a really nice program called  urlLink Litestep .  It makes normal windows look like   HAL logic command       -Or-          MAC OS X PANTHER!!!          There are alot of themes.  Do a google search for them.  Try it out. HAVE FUN!!  The think youll most notice is there are not desktop icons, no taskbar, just a pretty nice theme(s).  IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE WINDOZ AT ALL(except it has the system tray icons).  The dock was not with litestep.  Right now ive forgotten what program it is.

      My school system gets out on June 1st.  It is March now.  Know what this means?  MY SCHOOL IS GETTING OUT IN 2 MONTHS (or so).  So i feel its appropriate to but a countdown up right here for how much longer till school is out for me right up there. WHERE THE HECK DID THE YEAR GO.  IT SEEMS LIKE A HUGE BLUR OF PROJECTS AND TESTS AND WORK. Plus you factor in  that this is my freshmen highschool year makes my hair fall out all by itself.  Thank you for listening and if you dont get out that early my deepest apologies.

      Ok so maybe some of you saw one of these on the community blog:  urlLink     So what is atom? Well know how you have to go to each persons blog (or even your  urlLink favorite news site )? with atom and xml, you dont have to! You open one program and POOF! you see all the news and blog entries you would have seen if you went to the site.  What programs, you ask? Good question.  The problem with blogger is that it use atom feeds.  Atom is pretty new, so not many programs support it. And the ones that work with atom are pretty crappy.  I've looked at and used  urlLink BottomFeeder  on my Mac(but it can work with PC), and found it to suck VERY BADLY.  After i realized this, i went in search of another pc program.  I did a lovely google search and found a couple.   urlLink RssReader  and  urlLink Amphetadesk , and found both dont work with Atom feeds.  so the search went on and then i found what seems to me for now to be the best free rss and atom feeder yet.  Name?  urlLink Tristana .  The big fact was its free which i was previously using a shareware version of  urlLink Newzcrawler .  Tristana will be put to the test for a while, ill get back to you but if you want use it for now.    Now how about mac?  I just found a shareware app that works nicely which i may buy because its so nice and it works with atom.  Its called  urlLink NewsFan .  I love the interface plus i can read all of your funny stuff on your blogs.  Bottomline: You wanna keep going to each persons webpage to look at their newest posts?

         Leo Laporte, co host of Techtv's The Screen Savers, has decided to stop hosting The Screen Savers.  Let me explain why this is important  Leo brought out the fun side of all the people on the show.  He was also a mac user.  HE was the main reason i even wanted to get that channel.  And now hes just doing the other show on the channel, Call For Help.  Yes I know, this means he used to do 2 shows nightly.  But think of this also, Leo also hosts a radio show in LA, Calif.  I can understand why he decided to stop hosting  a show , but why TSS?  I would have prefered to have him stop Call For Help.  TSS is the more advanced technical show, and the cooler of the 2.   but heres to you Leo, may you come back soon (or just quit because of the comcast purchase of techtv and G4 TV and Techtv merging).      **UPDATE**: Due to contract disagreements with the current owners of TechTV, Leo is no longer with Techtv at the moment.   " The reasons for my leaving are complicated. As I posted  urlLink here  a few weeks ago, management and I had come to a very satisfactory agreement about a new work schedule and salary, but at the last minute TechTV's outgoing owner, Vulcan Ventures, insisted that I sign away all claims to shares they had given me some years ago. I was unwilling to do so, and they held my job as hostage.   My leaving has nothing to do whatever with G4 or Comcast. In fact, I'm very sorry that I won't be around to participate in the transition. I've already contacted G4 to let them know I'd be glad to continue working at the new channel once they take over and I hope that I'll get that chance.

      hey, why not?  It's not really a "rant" per se anyway, just a comparison of Mac Software Update and Windows upate (click for bigger images)  urlLink     Here is the list for windows update.  A web site, blah blah blah   urlLink     Heres how it looks when you install something.  So there you go, Windows Update.  Personally I've seen alot better.  Like this:   urlLink      Mac Update looks so much better.  And the chooser looks like that too

Well, only 2, but is that normal in a one week span?  Lets see, i got a free one with  urlLink spymac (you guys will see that account when i get my calendar posted and set up on that site), and just now(4/20/04, 8:50PM) i noticed i got invited to be a beta tester for  urlLink Google's   urlLink Gmail .

        urlLink Spymac ::  News  : "Yahoo ups the e-mail ante 05/14/2004 08:12 | By Michael Simon    In the recent battle for e-mail storage dominance, Yahoo has entered the game with an interesting combination of punches; according to senior vice president Jim Brock, 'Our objective has been to make storage limits a non-issue for users.'  The Mercury News reports that storage limits for free mail users will jump from 4 megabytes to 100 megabytes, while premium users who pay an annual fee will get unlimited storage. Currently, Yahoos premium e-mail service, which includes 100MB of storage, costs $49.79 per year.  Michael Bazeley reports that the new Yahoo service is expected to roll out in phases and will be 'more tightly integrated with Yahoo's other services,' including instant messaging, photo sharing and news headlines."   Yahoo mail is a good mail to use for spam accounts.  You sign up for accounts at other sites that need emails, you fill in bogus stuff and enter a yahoo email.  For if you dont you get a bunch of spam for signing up.  so sign up for yahoo mail, and fill in bogus info and use yahoo as email address. SPAM GALORE.

      A proposition has been placed on the table.  This summer, the parents are gonna make me do a lot of work for them.  In return, they are planning on getting me an Apple  urlLink iBook !!  I have to work hard though, there is a lot we want to do, and now that we bought a 3rd vehicle, a truck, a lot more can be done.  So first i go to vermont and have to work to live there, then i have to work at home to get an iBook.  I think it will be worth it.

      Last week before EOCs(end of course), everthing is tumbling to the ground.  Every class is doing at least something in the way of test review.  A positive exemption from 1, another i should be exempt from.  "They" are being very shady about who is exempt.  Of course, algebra and english allow no exemptions.  Teachers say on fri. they will spill the beans.  A lighter note: one of wheatons friends is buying a mac, her first one, and i will be setting it up whilst im up there.  I want the mac shes getting, its a  urlLink laptop .  [current mood:STRESSED!!!AND VERY VIOLENT] [current music: Homeward Bound, Simon and Garfunkel]  HELP ME

Toshiba said it has been 'seeing a large amount of interest in the drive from companies looking to produce similar portable digital music players or more advanced devices that can also play video.' The drive is expected to enter mass-production during July or August."   Ok thats a lot of space for your music.  and very very  very  tiny in the world of hard drives.  I just hope they can keep up with demand, even if they plan to ship out 350000 of the hard drives. Pretty amazing the advancements in computers.

Jon, susannah and I went to go to an interview for a job for jon, took jon to his a+ test(he passed), then saw shrek 2.  Muchly good movie.  Then we went to duke gardens, pretty pretty.  not to mention jon and susannah broke up then got back together again.  and thats what i was bummed about.  but now their back together(i think) and im happier.  maybe ill even eat some food.

      So today i drove the tractor again.  Wheaton was co-driving.  Wheaton doesnt like my driving.  He did compliment my usage of the clutch, but otherwise he wont let me drive it anymore.  Ah well, there are all the other vehicles to move around anyway.  Firehouse Auction tommarow.  Have to help with that later.  Heard there is a wedding or something sometime.       Miss you zannah

      You know you've found someone you really like when every minute your not trying to get hit in the head by 2x4s, getting mowed over by the tractor, making sure a tree doesnt fall on you, driving the vehicles, etc etc that you like them very much.  susannah

      ...to pack and get ready to go to albany for the airplane ride home.  We are leaving at like 1:30 or something along that line. 2 hours in the car, then blah in the plane.        Its been really fun, and i really dont wanna go back.  Yet at the same time i do want to go back.  Im so confused arent I?  Meeting all the people i talk to online was really fun, and wheaton is always fun.  Too bad he has one of those "life" things.  Don't worry, i'll be back everyone.  You can count on it.

      Well, today i drove the tractor without marshall on it, we had to get a hay wagon that spontaneously rolled over to the other side of the rode.  Created a nice 2 car traffic jam.  Did very good apparently.  At the very least didnt crash anything.  Contra tonight, leaving tommarow at 4pm(i think[i hope]).  Been SO much fun.  But at the same time glad to be going home.  After all my whole life is at home, not here.  [Current Mood: mixedness] [Current Music: 'Richard Cory' Simon & Garfunkel]

      Alas, only one week left here in vermont.  Going to Burlington late tuesday, come back uh wednesday(not sure).  It's been so much fun and went by oh so fast.  Did i mention it was fun? yeah i did.  Great to meet rosie and laura in person.  haying, (forced manual labor), driving vehicles(check engine lights on all of them, truck in the shop(literally, wheaton driving though)), fragging wheaton in violent video game demos.      Yet at the same time, im happy to be home, i get to get my ibook sometime, drive the truck a little, see susannah again.  Poor Rosie; both of us are using her to state how much we miss each other.  Sorry Rosie.        Wanna know what im doing right now? sitting in front of a sexy laptop and watching wheaton boy frag people in violent video games.  Talking to people via I.M.  Listening to music.  WRITING THIS POST.  So peaceful up here.  Everyone should move to Vermont.  The country towns of vermont.  Everyone's family.

      ok, lets just say ive been living on peanut butter jelly sandwiches and hot dogs all week.  Thats right ladies and gentlemen: i cant cook.  Though the fact remains ive been with zannah alot during the time that is known as lunch, and when im around her i feel full.  In every single aspect of the word.  We said we wouldnt, but we seem to be seeing each other every day.  And it will be hard to adjust whence school starts, but she'll have work so it wont be as bad for her.  As for me, the stress will run back in a bone-mangling second.  But that is soooooooooo far away and thats waaaaaaaaaayy good

      I believe i forgot to mention: i made so many great friends up in vermont.  you know who you are, and thank you.  sometimes i find myself reflecting on years past, and what has gone on during my lifetime.  The one thing is, i never seem to think about events that have affected our nation, our world.  That holds some exemptions.  I know about loss of ozone and forest deepletion and rain forest depletion.  But thats more about the stupid stuff humans do and they all have a common theme: nature.  Nature is the most awesome thing imaginable, and we cannont recreate it. ever.  And now, more than ever, we need to appreciate it.  Alot of americans stay up all night watching tv.  Eating fast food.  laughing and drinking.  I never see myself doing that.  I want to be outside. forever.  I want to live where its never too hot to be outside, and never too cold or snowy.  Id love to live in vermont, even though its not fitting the criteria of what i just said.  And its not about family being up there or all the great people wheaton is around all the time.  Its nature and vermonts people who want to protect it.  I never look at politics, i dont really care about it.  I refuse to vote for a president ever.  It doesnt matter to me who "rules over" the USA, as long as i can be outside all i want, enjoying nature; a thing we have and may never be able to recreate.  To everyone i say this: avoid staying inside as much as possible.  Enjoy nature, while you still can.  Cause one day, maybe not when we are alive, maybe when we are still living, nature will cease to exist.  And that will be a sad day.  Not just for America, but for the entire globe.  And what it runs down to is the human race in unison dont belive they are the rulers of the world.  And it comes to the realization that america has so many freedoms, they think that all the american freedoms give them reason to destroy our beautiful country with skyscrapers, expensive housing, and statues that take up the whole horizon.  We, as americans, dont realize that not everyone has the rights we have.  And i think even if other countries had the power to create all the things we can and deforest everywhere, they wouldnt.  The thing is they do it for the money.  they are the ones raising cattle for us to eat.  they are falling land to raise the food we eat.  We take for granted what we have in this world: all the technology and fast food and edible food when other countries have absolutly nothing.    I have not seen the other big countries, but i feel they are the same.  You guys arent the above described people, but realize that some of our nation is.

      Its just hit me.  The internet is an amazing tool.  Its not just fun.  Think about  urlLink Happy Dale , its uniting 2 people from NC to well alot of people in vermont.  Think about AIM or ICQ or any of the others, people across the nation, even across the WORLD, can type and even TALK to a person living 20000 miles away.  I met Rosie and Laura through AIM via wheaton.  Things like  urlLink the livejournal  community that zannah created.  Things like this blog, email.  All ways to express whatever you feel.  And that we do.  So much freedom, so little time.  And so much you can do.  People can stay informed with the latest news, from  urlLink tech  to worldwide news such as bbc news.  Even to news in our own hometown.  All online.  Amazing.  And to think the internet sprouted from a military technology to keep all the military united in case of something bad with redundancy to avoid a disaster area.  Email is another example of military tech going worldwide.  And now just about everyone is online, many now joining the group carrying broadband internet(thats the fast stuff).  So thank the military for giving this technology to the public, and thank blogger for their great blogging service

      ...in your life where everything is going bad? I think ive hit that currently.  Yet at the same time things are so wonderful with me and zan.  but on of the things going bad is shes left for vermont.  Still dating though... and ive just learned today that dads applied for a job in MARYLAND.  The people are serious about dad as a worker there.  it starts in sept if he gets it, so i start school then leave in the beginning.  Whats life trying to tell me?  Help me

      Poor Zan.  Nothing going for her.  Couldnt leave today, car decided it wasnt ready.  Also realized personally that if i tried to be with someone else, it wouldnt work.  I couldnt open up to anyone except Susannah.  I couldnt open up with anyone else the way i do zan.  Realized also im spoiled in the way of food, too much fast food and i start to not have an appetite.    A lighter note but not really: i got my schedule for the 2004-2005 school year.  With that came a reinstation of my report card, a 3.5 gpa, and all the other goodies for parents to know.    Zan: Whenever im not around you, i feel you in spirit.  Watching over me even if you are still here on Earth and not gone away.  Everyone be nice to Zan

Barely starting high school and already college has to be part of my life.  pain. agony.  The only thread of support is smashed.  i have no one else. all my friends dont matter, so why should i matter?  Whats life matter?  Ive known for years lifes not fair.  Ive accepted that already.  I never have  been able to set up a plan for my life, not specifics, never specifics.  Only a vague outline.  Im not like you.  Your not like me.    what part of that can you not see?

      The age 15 seems to have alota bad things associated with it for everyones lives.  Its really amazing.  One year.  Chaos. Complete chaos.  And I seem to be making a nice chapter for myself for this year currently havent I?  I mean, just this summer i fell in a severe state of love, lost 2 best guy friends, learned that  wheaton is a brick wall when it comes to emotions, Maryland, etc....So I feel the worst ever.  The thing is, i went to my open house, saw an awesome friend whom gave me a hug, and i put on a fake smile told her i fell in love and am in a relationship.  I mean no use trying to mope around a good friend.  so i didnt tell her it all but then i was happy to be seeing thoyre(tech teacher), so i really wasnt too down.  How could i not be happy i saw alotta people i knew and liked alot. and went and said hi to the teachers of yesteryear.  Amazing how such small things can break your whole life apart.  Well the thing that broke me today was melody being in a bad mood and hit me hard about my girlfriend.  She just doesnt have the patience for people like her.  I think it was all down to anger and she migiht nto have ment it.    Heres hoping.          Its just our family is so close that to hear it from one of us isnt good.  whats worse is shes related by the blood so its worse.  I'm ok now guys.  Just remember: if you havent been through the age that is 15 AKA HELL, WATCH OUT.  It'll kick you around, but remember most of the adult population has been through it  cheers

      all i really need is a hug from someone outside the immediate family and i cant do that right now. tis lovely to talk to people for late night, but school call soon, and i wont be able to do it. not to mention i dont get to use this laptop for a while.  i hope to get my own soon.  Id like to thank everyone that listened to my problems lately, and apologize for giving them so much of my stress, i apologize but sometimes i need to vent.  THANK YOU
