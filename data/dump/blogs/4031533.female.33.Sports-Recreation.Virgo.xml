          The Shins  were formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the unlikeliest base for an indie rock band, and is now under Sub Pop Records, the same label that catapulted Nirvana to glory.   Although some say that their music is not very hot, with lyrics like these from  Kissing the Lipless , what's there not to like?   But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves it has too much to do with me and secretly I want to bury in the yard the grey remains of a friendship scarred    urlLink Download it here

         Lifehouse came out with their first album "No Name Face" a few years ago. There were quite a number of tracks which are quite good, with "Hanging by a moment" receiving quite a lot of air time then. However, there are some other gems in the album like "Breathing", "Only One", "Somewhere In Between", "Everything".  Have you ever woke up early before your love one and just lie there and watch the person sleep, breathing gently? Interesting thing about this song is that its also about unrequitted love.   urlLink Down it here

         You don't hear much of the  The Pretenders  these days, but there was a time in the '80s and into the mid '90s that The Pretenders kicked ass!   Fronted by the dynamic Chrissie Hynde, who by the way, looks absolutely great entering into her 50s, the band went on to produce great music right up to 2002, their latest album  Loose Screw .   Take a listen to  Complex Person , an easy listening track from that album; something very nice to sing to on a day when you feel like you're without a care in the world.   urlLink Download it here

           urlLink Silje Nergaard   has the kind of vocals you wished your local jazz lounge singer had. She hails from the land of fjords and no, I have no idea how to pronounce her name either.   Be Still My Heart  was the biggest hit from her album  At First Light . Her voice is endowed with etheral qualities but somehow sounds child-like at the same time. This is the kind of song you want to listen to after a major falling-out with your lover - full of longing, regret and pining.   urlLink Download it here

          ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead , a band with one of the longest names around, assaults you with lots of drums, guitars and anguished vocals.  1999's  Mistakes and Regrets  is a perfect example of T.O.D's style.

         In 1975 the duo of Hall & Oates scored a major hit with ' Sara Smile '. Daryl Hall wrote it for his girlfriend Sara Allen.

          Chromeo , this Montreal duo emerged in the hip hop circle during early-to-mid 90's. But later on Tiga, Turbo Recordings head approached them in the summer of 2000 and talked them into doing something electronic.  With this track expect a disco party funk beats. On the other hand,  as for the debut LP, expect to hear a lot of rhinestone-studded analog synths, rock guitars, 80's, rhodes and talk box.  Their debut LP,  She's In Control  will be released later in Europe on June 28th this year.    urlLink Download it here

         Get ready for the weekend with a lil jerky electro beats from  Felix da Housecat . This track was taken off his latest album,  Devin Dazzle & The Neon Fever  (Emperor Norton, 2004) which was released on 25th of May.   This creative Chicago remix veteran DJ/producer combines raw guitars with an edgy and grungy groove in this track. Though it only lasted for 2mins & 18 sec, it sure brings you back to the colorful 80s electronic dance music scene.  However, if you love synthesizers and wouldnt mind the silly or bad dancing that goes along with it, you should pick up this album. This one is for the digital music lovers.

         You will just love this song by  Yo La Tengo ,  Don't Have To Be So Sad . It's a slow one, reminding me a little of Moby's  Porcelain , only better because it is complex yet ends up being really simple, as everything mixes well together.  A really good one for those late night drives down deserted roads.   urlLink Download it here

         After a hard day's work, all you want to do is relax, have a glass of wine in one hand and recline in your favourite armchair/sofa/bed/whatnot, and have great, soothing music wash over your senses and maybe as a bonus, make you a little horny in the process.   Zero 7 's  Destiny  does just that to you. Smooth instumentals coupled with the very sexy (though a little nasal) vocals of Sophie Barker makes you feel at home with yourself. Of course the line:  I'm watching porn in my hotel dressing gown , just leave things up to your own imagination!   urlLink Download it here

          Cake  exploded onto the scene in 2000 with their hipped up rendition of 'I Will Survive'. Checkout the vicious grooves on this track about a race car driver.   The sun has gone down and the moon has come up, And long ago somebody left with the cup, But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns, And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.  He's going the distance. He's going for speed. She's all alone, all alone in her time of need.    urlLink Download it here

         Simply Red was formed in 1984. They are a great band, especially live, but sadly it is lead singer Mick Hucknall who gets all the plaudits ( maybe because the other band members keep changing). Well,it was the track "Holding Back The Years" that broke Simply Red into the big-time and of course "Stars".But this song "For Your Babies" from the album "Stars" remains my all time favourite from them.   urlLink Download it here

      Russian waltz is different from the classical waltzes written by Romantic composers such as Chopin, or Brahms because of the contemporary flair and a hint of russian pride.   Shostakovich (1906-75) , a Russian composer living in the midst of the Soviet rule. With heavy accents and elaborate music, one would visulise the Russians dancing to this tune with freeflow of Vodka and meat. Free spirited, and yet with a strong sense of patriotism, is what makes Russian music extremely expressive and emotional.   urlLink Download here

The original version is by Roy Orbison called 'Crying (Over You)' which most of us are already familar with.  However she has another version which is a lot better then boring old Roy's version.

         From London,  Departure Lounge  released their third album  Too Late To Die Young  (Bella Union, 2002). With its combination of fuzzed-out effects, super-romantic lyrics and soulful trumpet, this song is slow, gradually buildup into an understated, yet passionate epic, a timeless and beautiful song.   This song is, if I may say, ultimately the song that should be played during any weddings. Only here, it sounds less overwrought, less desperate but instead, it's happy and content.  Truly gorgeous.   urlLink Download it here    From this day on we will share Every joy and every care It's all brand new My search is through It's unconditionally you

         Gary Lightbody's soft yet self-critical voice and lyrical composition. When you put together this two things, you get this song from  Snow Patrol  that does the magic of warm meloncholy towards its listeners by its mellow guitar riffs. Well, at least for me.   Though it sounded slightly depressing at first listen but what caught my attention was its beautiful lyrics. Bloody awesome.  Another one for the obscure record. I'm looping it.    urlLink Download it here.   Looking for the lyrics?  Here.    I'll sing it one last time for you Then we really have to go You've been the only thing that's right In all I’ve done  And I can barely look at you But every single time I do I know we'll make it anywhere Away from here  Light up, Light up As if you have a choice  Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear  Louder, louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say  To think I might not see those eyes It makes it so hard not to cry And as we say our long goodbye I nearly do  Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear  Louder, louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say  Slower, slower We don't have time for that All I want is to find an easier way To get out of our little heads  Have heart my dear We're bound to be afraid Even if it's just for a few days Making up for all this mess  Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear

          Morrissey , the former frontman of  The Smiths  who said, "Bush should have died, not Reagan," and that  Britney Spears is the devil , is no stranger to controversy.     urlLink One of the most influential figures in alternative rock,  Morrissey's  legendarily sensitive, melancholy persona made him a highly polarizing icon, reviled in some quarters with nearly the same intensity he inspired in his passionately devoted fans. As the lead singer of the Smiths, arguably the most important indie band in Britain during the '80s, Morrissey's theatrical crooning and literate, poetic lyrics -- filled with romantic angst, social alienation, and cutting wit -- connected powerfully with a legion of similarly sensitive, disaffected youth.

          Double Negative  by  The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up    This, this is the truth. I’ve checked all my facts and I’ve got all the proof I need. I keep forgetting why I’m here, I keep feeling I shouldn’t be. The looks I keep getting, the talk in my ear keeps reminding me. It reminds me how our friendship died, how my presence here is a thorn in your side. I keep forgetting why I’m here, it’s because I’m a petty guy who spends his time fabricating useless lies. I wanna know why you had to say the things you said, the time you spent inside my head. I don’t mind. The truth is somewhere in between, hurting you and killing me. You are resigned with your shoulders shrugged, a sideways glance, a nodded head, a non-response. It’s so unkind. The truth is somehow hidden but still hurting you. It’s a lie. It’s my lovesong to you.    urlLink Download it here

           I'm half the man I used to me This I feel as the dawn It fades to gray    The Stone Temple Pilots had something going on. It was good. Then the lead singer went and fucked it all up for them. This is vintage 1993 STP.   urlLink download it here

         I like this song by  Dykehouse .  Chain Smoking  is fun and lighthearted and it's about a guy who starts chain smoking because a girl dumped him. How can you possibly not love this song?   urlLink Download it here

         The Cassady sisters of  CocoRosie  are quintessentially quirky, so it's no surprise that their songs are equally quirky too.  Good Friday  is testament to that fact. The song immediately reminds you of a secret French summer affair.   urlLink Download it here
