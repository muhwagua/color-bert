        From: Bob Holman Sent: Sunday, March 28, 2004 12:22 AM To: 'Guy Lecharles-Gonzalez' Subject: WOW   So much to say, but overall, UNBEFUCKINLIEVABLE  Please forward to Eric, Helen, and crew.  Let's talk.  How about 8pm Friday May 14?  B  More than any other feedback I've received on the show so far, this was the most gratifying, especially taken in tandem with his initial comment at the end of the show about it far exceeding his expectations.  It exceeded even mine.  I was an anxious wreck the couple of hours before the show started as we drove in from Westchester after dropping the kids off at grandma's for the night. It occurred to me that there were so many firsts I was facing with this show: an untested format; a super-tight schedule; a venue with people assigned to specific jobs that knew what they were doing. For a control freak like me, there was so much out of my direct control, my stomach was churning.  By 7:59pm, everyone involved in the show was in the house and we were ready to go. Breathe...  After a quick welcome and 5-minute warning, through which Xtina's  Dirrrrty  played, I kicked things off with what was supposed to be a 5-minute monologue/introduction. It was obvious I haven't slammed in years as it was three full typed pages and nowhere near 5 minutes! I edited on the fly, trying to retain the key points and surprised that I'd memorized as much of it as I did. I think it came off a just a little bit awkward but it also set the stage nicely for the debate to come as it concluded with a shot right between Taylor and Roger's eyes. (It's printed below.)  Next was the showcase with Jessica Torres, Mara Jebsen and Luis Cartagena. Each was great and gave exactly the kinds of performances I hoped for, illustrating the range of performance poetry, or as I later categorized it: poetry, performed.  The initial debate followed as I introduced Eric and Helen and we sparred a little bit to get the juices flowing before the break. This part was probably the most broken aspect of the evening as instead of challenging the point I made on the distinction between poetry, performance poetry and poetry, performed, Eric and Helen simply disagreed, dismissed it as semantics and the moment fell flat! We recovered quickly, went back and forth for another couple of minutes and went to the break.  Coming back, Roger and Taylor did their mini-features, with Roger annoyingly going over time as he flubbed his last piece while attempting to incorporate the loop station and his own beat-boxing. Celena Glenn, after some prodding, saved him by backing him up but he started the poem over and turned a 10-minute set into 15 minutes. The self-confident, boastful performance served as an amazing contrast for his timid debate performance that would follow. Taylor stuck close to his allotted time with a set of two of his own poems and two covers, one by Billy Coliins and one by RAC. The Collins piece, where he almost-lovingly disses a fellow poet, was prefaced with a list of poems Taylor has written mocking certain styles or people (his opening piece was an entertaining rip on Reggie Gibson and jazz poets) and seemed more like defense mechanism - hey, a poet laureate does this stuff, too! - than actual homage.  We finally jumped into the debate with the clock ticking fast and only 15 minutes left in the show. After a couple of ice breaker questions -  Lord of the Rings  or  Star Wars ? Should Ralph Nader run for President? - we got into the meat of the debate, covering slam strategy; emotional vs. literal truth in poetry; and the question of craft vs. truth. Taylor made the bold comment that just because something is true (ie: rape) doesn't make it a good poem, and perhaps it was more appropriate as a journal entry. An audience member misinterpreted Taylor's stance and thought he was saying such poems shouldn't be written. It got a little tense and was probably the height of audience interaction as people began throwing around opinions, defending Taylor and putting their own personal agendas into play. Helen (a social worker by day) nailed it by pointing out that sometimes people  need  to write and read these poems as part of their healing/coping process.  While Taylor was game throughout, making his points strongly and defending them, Roger was in rope-a-dope mode, trying to nuance every answer to be as non-offensive as possible. I told him afterwards that he was like the front-runner in a debate, being so careful not to make a mistake that he got trampled in the process. Eric and Helen didn't get involved as much as I'd hoped they would but Helen did get in a couple of good points and her final question: How do you keep your poetry from becoming too self-important or self-indulgent?, was a zinger. In the end, we pused almost 10 minutes over our time but it was all good as Bob loved it.  By all accounts, both from poets and regular audience, the night was a wild success. It tread a thin line of being too insider at times, especially as everything often came back to the slam and the points with Taylor, but it was always dynamic and never bogged down. Some great feedback on things to tweak for next week and I have a couple of ideas about how to give the debate more time without compromising the showcase portion, which is inviolable.  I'm still processing a lot of what happened and can't wait to actually watch the tape and see it from an outside perspective. If you were there, thanks for supporting. (And send me your  urlLink feedback , good and bad!) If you missed it, you really missed something special and you better be there this Saturday!

      Welcome to the Bowery Poetry Club and the first edition of  louder than words ! I am Guy LeCharles Gonzalez, your host and, more importantly for tonight's show, I am bored as hell with the poetry scene!  Those that know me know that, even more than poetry, I am especially passionate about politics. I have no interest in college basketball and March Madness but earlier this year, I was watching the Democratic debates and the primaries like it was the 2000 Subway Series.  I came out on the losing end of both of those.  Politics fascinate me - both the nitty-gritty nuances of each candidate's positions on the issues, and the fun random shit like:  "Did John Kerry get Botox shots?"  Of course he did! His wife swears by them, why wouldn't he? What I don't get is why he lies about it? It's like Anna Nicole Smith denying she lost weight.  Even better, though, was a few weeks ago when Kerry was being interviewed on the American Urban Radio Network - the only African-American-owned network radio company in the U.S. - and he said, quote:   "President Clinton was often known as the first black president. I wouldn't be upset if I could earn the right to be the second."   First of all, once they got over the obvious and wrongheaded attempt at pandering, I think most black people would be surprised to hear that there?s already been one black president.  To Kerry's limited defense, the comment wasn't totally out of left-field as it was none other than Nobel Prize-winner Toni Morrison, one of the most respected black writers of our time, who tagged Clinton with the label back in 1998, in the midst of the whole Lewinsky scandal, saying he was, quote:   "...our first black president. Blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime. [He] displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas."   The only stereotype she left out was the size of his dick!  All that aside, though, where in the world did a silver-spoon millionaire like John Kerry see the parallel with Clinton that he thought qualified him to be the second black president?   Forget Toni Morrison, not even Will Smith could make that stretch work for him.  Politics can be as exciting as any sports event. If anything, it bears the closest resemblance to wrestling. I mean, where else do you get story lines like these?  My favorite thing recently was the whole fuss over the ending of social promotion here in the City. Third graders that couldn't read or write were being promoted to fourth grade because some believed it would damage their self-esteem to be left back.  Yeah, because those 19-year old High School sophomores are simply bursting with self-pride, right?  People were upset with Mayor Bloomberg because he dismissed three of his appointees the night before the vote because they were going to vote against ending social promotion and the measure would have been defeated. So he canned them, replaced them with three people that were in favor of getting rid of the policy, and he got his way.  "This is what mayoral control is all about," he explained.  Amen to that.  Now, if only there was that kind of control in the world of poetry slam.  Think about it. How many poetry slams have you been to where the winning poet was worse than some of the first-timers in the open mic? Then you hear they were on Team Boondocks at the National Poetry Slam, or they've appeared on  Def Poetry , and you kind of nod in understanding.  Another victim of social promotion!  One of the problems with poetry slams is that some poets take them too seriously. They believe the hype when they win one, and think the whole format is stupid when they lose.  They ask questions like: "How can you give truth a four?"  The reality of poetry slams is they're like the third grade of the poetry world. Too many poets take their three or four decent poems that score well, read them over and over, and then get promoted to the next grade before they're ready. Suddenly you have poets touring the country doing 30-minute sets padded with some of the wackest poetry this side of Jewel's last attempt.  And there's the even sadder flip-side to that. The elementary school equivalent of the big-boned 6th grader that won't get out of the sandbox and let the 3rd graders play. By all rights, they should be on the monkey bars or pushing the smaller kids on the swings but instead, they can't seem to escape the simple comforts of surrounding themselves with people of lesser abilities.  They're the 5-year olds that snatch the bottle from their 1-year old sibling and declare survival of the fittest.  40-year olds living in mom's basement, still working their paper routes from high school.  Tonight, we've got a couple of those reluctant-to-move-on poets in the house, Roger Bonair-Agard and Taylor Mali. Between them, there's more than 17 years of poetry slam experience!  We're going to bring them up later, let them read a few poems each - hopefully some we haven't already heard a million times since we're not keeping score - and then we're going to run them through the grinder defending themselves.  Before that, though, we've got a special showcase for you, a little something Taylor once called the "Who's That?" of the poetry scene. Without further ado, or annoyingly pretentious introductions, welcome to  louder than words !

      A few years back I wrote an article for  Poets & Writers  on the poetry slam that included the following quote from Bob Holman:   "Poetry itself is revolutionary. To write a poem, even to read a poem, to take on all that language can give you is to become an activist. To get the poem to people in this world, you have to utilize the mechanisms that this world provides." While I still buy his last point, that you have to work within the system, I'm not so sure anymore about that first part.  What makes poetry revolutionary? Is it the fact that it's one of the more underappreciated art forms? Is it its inherent flexibility, the fact that different types of poetry can appeal to vastly different groups of people? How is this different from film? Or novels? Or dance, for that matter? If there's no real difference, where's the revolution come in?  As for poets being activists, is that necessarily true? Does it depend on subject matter? Would a right-wing, Christian fundamentalist poet be considered an activist? What about funny poets? Would that mean stand-up comedians are activists? Can you be an activist against your will, or despite your best intentions to be anything but?  Do poets have a responsibility to anything beyond than their own art? More or less so than actors? Does a poet lose legitmacy for purposely giving their art a commercial bent?  Where is the line between accessibility and pandering?  Was Walt Whitman cognizant of his place in literary history? What about Emily Dickinson? Does the fact the she went virtually unknown until after her death make her more or less a poet?  If a poet wins the National Poetry Slam, does it help or impede their career? Or, does it have no material effect at all?  Regie Gibson, 1998 indie champ, peaked in 1997 with the release of  Love Jones . Roger Bonair-Agard, 1999 indie champ, peaked in 2000 with the publication of the co-authored  Burning Down the House . Shane Koyczan, 2000 indie champ, peaked in...2000 with the indie championship. Mayda del Valle, 2001 indie champ, was an original cast member of the Tony award-winning  Def Poetry  and is now touring the country with Norman Lear's  Declare Yourself . The National Poetry Slam itself peaked in 1999 with an appearance on the front page of the  New York Times'  Arts section and a featured segment on  60 Minutes .  Like the mainstream's fickle tastes, the mechanisms to reach them change like the wind. Has poetry slam's moment passed?  Tackle some of these questions directly in the comments section or in your own journals and post the links. Some of this will be fodder for the next  louder than words , Friday, May 21st with RAC and Keith Roach.

      A subtly arrogant, right-of-center white guy, very educated, slight chip on his shoulder, shows up at the Bowery Poetry Club on May 21st for Louder Than Words.  He decides that the majority of the  NYC poetry community represents a bunch of bleeding heart, "Simon Says" auto-bots, and feels it is his duty to "educate you", because he's tired of your tattooed, private-pierced, Nature's Blessing wearing, Patchouli Oil stinking, bumper-sticker shoutin', victim mentality whining, conspiracy theory spinning, high-brow high-art, "I can spell better than you" bullshit.  He is passionate about a number of topics, ranging from "Gay Marriage" to "Legalizing Pot" to "Good Poetry".  Would you be interested in "civilly discussing" these topics with this individual, say, in a live format?  Just curious- let me know.

      I've been processing this weeks show- some things to mention.  *Having guests of a similar bent for a show that is intended to inspire spirited and intelligent debate is not a very good idea- especially if the hosts are not passionate about any opposing views.  Granted, with Bob giving us these two dates on short notice- Guy did the best he could in putting together an attractive marquee-  the show probably would have been a lot higher energy if it were a double feature, not a (wanna-be) debate  problem was- the conversation turned pretty high-brow at times- awesome for coffee, weed, or a single malt with some jazz in the background- but a friend I invited, who's an avid reader of poetry, apologized for falling asleep- I'm not fucking kidding.  For me, I love the cerebral stuff- I could do it all night- but I have this floating antenna that keeps me pretty tuned into the audience at all times, and I felt the drag of the non-hardcore poets- it literally fatigued me- kind of like hosting a low-energy slam.  The challenge is going to be keeping the interest of the non-poetry community once we get them in the door while keeping the content important to poets/artists.  Job one is lacing the stage with talented, passionate and articulate guests and hosts that can only tolerate themselves being right most times, because they believe it fully (or can make you believe it fully, hence, making you question your own shit)-  we're about half-way there.  I think the dialogue is crucial for poetry, but if we string together a few of these, we'll have to do naked mud-wrestling at the break to keep a summer run intact.  Good points- I think Guy and I flowed a lot better this week- there were periods that felt effortless, like crushing a 300 yard drive with a perfect golf swing- and I totally love how he unconsciously begins spewing his personal agenda- then again, that's probably by design- but I like it- he keeps me on my toes, that new age Nazi- Diane lent some quality texture, but I think she was a bit timid in working the crowd  - the best part of the whole debate came with tyhimba jess (sorry if I butchered your name)- it was like he was the only dude in the crowd that had a fucking opinion-   -the rest of the audience was like "oh my goodness, if I open my mouth, Russell will never pick me for def jam!"  hey Russell- if you're reading this, uhm...  I think you're doing amazing things for poets and poetry, and I love your clothes- and although I'm white... I'm Italian- and my black friends (which I have many of) tell me that means I'm not totally white, and maybe even a little black, even though I was born in jersey and don't speak Italian, so-  I'm down. Dig?  Word.  more later.  or not.  etg

      A lot of people seem to be confused about my "agenda" for  louder than words .  Some think it's purely about the opportunity to mess with people I think are blowhards.  Others think it's about pushing a political ideology.  I'm sure there's a few whispering that it's pure vanity.  Earlier today, in a continuation of the discussion I posted an excerpt from yesterday in  urlLink my own journal , I expressed it like this: The show is intended to look under the mask so many poets wear when they're on stage and get a glimpse of what they're really about. How their minds work. What they stand for beyond the clever metaphors and hook lines. It's like intellectual improv.  Bob's spin on it, which Taylor seems to agree with, is one of the more thoughtful and interesting of the bunch:  "this show is the first true critique of the new po, slam/spoken/perfed, done in the only way it can be: LIVE & in yr FACE."   While more limited in scope than Eric and I initially thought, I'm starting to think he's nailed it. And hey, he  is  the guy that recognized the potential of slam and brought it to NYC where it blew up so who am I to argue with THAT?  ;-)  In other news, check out the previous entry's comments section for an interesting debate that's brewing about "the definition of poetry."  Good stuff!  Jump on in.  See you tomorrow night!

      Been a long time.  I took me a few weeks to recover from the dual disappointment of the low turnout for the last show and the fact that Eric was leaving town.  Was ready to scrap the whole thing and move on.  Did some thinking about the format, asked for and received some interesting feedback, and have decided to give it one more shot.  Tuesday, June 29 @ 8pm.  Bassey.  Omar.  Who knows what might happen?  If nothing else, I'm going to have fun with it, regardless of what happens. Otherwise, what's the point?

       2nd Poem for Today   your brain will leap out of its skin at the sight of two men walking arm in arm on the road to Damascus  one will carry a bald eagle  with a broken jaw and the other will sew his asshole shut with the end of the world  there will be no mourning the silence of the days you spent masking your grief with perturbed mallards on the pond of your own obituary HBO will not have a special dedicated to the raising of funds for your memory  tomorrow you awaken on the roadside  with dirt up your collar starched white shirt and third pant leg creased into submission by the diseases of men in convertibles whose sole purpose is to document your depravity in bipolar episodes of M*A*S*H  the music you hear will remind you of leaping the smells will not remind you of anything in particular but you will finally understand the meaning behind the Christ  there will be much weeping and gnashing of teeth  at the end of the republic  when all is accounted for you will only be left with the things you committed to an insane piece of paper the rest is food for the worms of your own hypocrisy  -Rich Villar

      Ok, so here are workshop rules (for now)  1. No talking about your poem where it came from, that you wrote it 5 minutes ago etc. Let it stand on it's own. We should be able to get it by reading the poem. If there is something missing that you wanted in then you have to rewrite, if people are misunderstanding it completely over and over, you have to rewrite   (B) You can post informative stuff like quotes, translations, notes to obscure references, stuff you'd include if you published it.  2. You CAN post questions (the more specific the better) such as      "does this metaphor work" or "is this line clear" or questions to guide the critique  3. Can't think of anymore rules.....heck who needs em. Do what you will, don't go easy on me, stay honest and true  peace and poetry

      You're probably wondering what this is? This is new years resolution number 42.   "When  you look in the mirror become what you were meant to be"    On a third dimension plane the shortest distance  between point  B to  _________point A  is a straight line and time  only moves in one direction              but I  have a tendency to meander   I've christened this blog Tesserblog after the Tessaract, a sorta psuedo scientific idea from the Madeline L'Engle book  A Wrinkle in Time   In it the characters Tessered, a term used for traveling through space by bending the time space continuum.  I thought that this could happen here. Take space out of the equation and create a virtual workshop. So when you wanna post a poem,you can post it here for critique. If you're feeling more social go check out personal blogs. Just one more thing to get addicted to   I've been working on my chap book, my first chap book, anxious to put some work behind me, to lay some poems to bed to commit them to whatever place they have in my literary life so that I can move on, intellectually, spiritually, emotionally and poetically, but I've been writing in a vacuum. My workshops have always been  informal....random dinners, long winded talks over beers and cigarettes. Seeing the growth of the public sphere online through blogging , I was struck with an idea? how about stepping it up a little and create a virtual workshop space. I know that we all post poems on our blogs randomly but the blogs (mine) have become a little too full? I kept having this problem in which I wanted to write personal journal entries, and other days post poems for critique and other days get involved in a public discussion that circled around many blogs.   So anyway I was struck with an idea? How about a place specifically built for that, where everyday a new poem was featured and the comment section which is left unused in most blogs except for randomly talking shit, could be harnessed into a productive critique. Sounds like an idea!  So here's how it works!  1. If you have a blog e-mail me so that I can give you admin access so you can post a poem.  2. If you don't have a blog you can e-mail me and I'll post if for you  3. I will not edit or censor anything  4. Posting anonymously is not only allowed but encouraged! Since for now we all know each other it might keep things simpler especially if we are not concerened with finding out people's b usiness through their poetry  5. This is new and exciting. I don't know the kinks yet but i'm anxious to find out! I'll post first!

      A deep sigh, and Hubert inhaled the panties. They were white cotton, (of course) and after much wear and tear the lace-elastic was already beginning to thin. Smelling underwear was like kissing; you had to do it with your eyes closed. It's not really sincere any other way. It had been a long day for Hubert and he was more than ready to call Dispatch and have them put him on the going home list, however he was stuck in the middle of bumper to bumper traffic so it was a mute point. By this time, it was almost a quarter to seven in the evening but the sun still burned the sky as if it were noon. It stood over the highway omniscient, not out of condemnation but more out of laziness; it was too hot to care. The heat outside crept steadily up to 99.3 degrees and thousands of cars were stuck on the Cross-Bronx because of an accident up front. Traffic was usually bad during rush hour but today it was particularly unbearable. The accident up front had intensified the bumper to bumper purgatory that Hubert was stuck in now. At this point, many of the cars had even turned their engines off in fear of overheating in this weather; besides they weren't going anywhere anyway. The lady on the radio who gave out traffic updates said that there was some "police business" still going on down there but she didn't give any details. Soon her voice faded out into a drone and Hubert closed his eyes again and inhaled all the way back to the brownstone in Park Slope. It was an OT from Connecticut and Hubert had almost not gotten the call but he had just made it back to the cab in time. This was a sweet ride, complete with extra stops and waiting time; the works. Guys usually just slept all the way home unless they had some young cheap company with them. Normally, though it was the women who made the expensive trips; especially with a company car at their disposal. It was those little things that turned simple trips to JFK into 300 dollar cash pots. Helping her with her bags was a must, it almost always assured a hefty tip, maybe even cash? It was a credit card that time and that was well and good so a humble thank you was in order. After the door closed, Hubert turned around and made his way down the steps of the newly renovated brownstown and back to his Town car. That's when it started. Hubert heard this loud rush of screaming girls coming at him and time slowed down as if it were congealed. They started coming, at first just one by one than two of them then three and four! An army of little girls riding by on their scooters! They zoomed past Hubert down the street. When they got there, they just stepped down, turned around, pumped, pumped and pushed. Soon they came back, whizzing by Hubert who was still hypnotized on the stairs. There was no amazement alive in Hubert, more curiousity. It was like watching an accident; you just had to look. They continued, just back and forth  back and forth….  back and forth….  back and forth…  Back on the Cross-Bronx, a frustrated Hubert frantically scratched his head and pulled at the sideburns he had to make up for the lack of hair on his head. Hubert kept shaking his head as if trying to get rid of a bug in his scalp and threw the panties down. "Hmmmph!" Frustrated, Hubert honked helplessly. There was no point; an accident a mile and half down had traffic blocked for at least two hours. The traffic was bad as was expected but the accident was like the nail in the coffin , making his stay here seem to last forever. Hubert assumed that; it was pretty gruesome, because though they usually clear this stuff quickly, there was still "police business" going on. But" who needs fingerprints in a car accident?" He wondered. Hubert sighed and wiped his forehead and then leaned back in his chair with his hand on the armrest. What was done was done and Hubert thought that he should just forget everything and just hope that he got out of this without getting caught. Hubert looked up at the dancing hula lady on his dashboard and thought, "Well she did buy me pizza." Jennica would understand, she was the type who did with just a little thinking and a little compassion. Hubert was amazed at how intently she listened to him describe Prospect Park before gentrification and how she didn't laugh when he told her guiltily that he still had a soft spot for the Muppet Babies. They were a little behind her time but she didn't have trouble adjusting. Hubert was now feeling hopeful and deciding on just trying to put everything behind him but fiddling in the blistering heat, every fidget brought him closer and closer to the panties. They just sat there, exhausted and teasing. Hubert was inhaling again.  The little girls were going by. Flimsy, the scooter was, supporting them; holding their legs together. They would go down that street (which they didn't cross) to one end, step down, turn around, pump pump and push! And off they were! Flying! on these flimsy scooters, holding their legs; together.  back and forth…  back and forth…  They kept going and going, never getting tired of that game. To one end of a street they didn't cross, to just turn around and go to another they don't cross. Back and forth and "They haven't fallen yet" mumbled Hubert in awe. Crack! and next thing you knew one of the girls had fallen, flat on her back. She had gone entirely too fast and her scooter wheel got stuck in one of the pits in the street. Still in shock, she lay there disheveled. Hubert raced over, no one seemed to be around at the moment and noticed her, her shirt crumpled as she turned on her stomach slowly and Hubert noticed "No spikes yet" in her pre-pubescent spine. "Don't worry honey" he consoled "You're safe, this time." Thank you she replied and jumped up, and with a quick brush she was off again. "I'm Jennica" she perked and her friends soon gathered around her to see if she was ok. She dusted off the wall she called a chest and with a wink she was off again down the street.   The Connecticut job had lasted all night and Hubert was in no hurry to get back on the list so he patched into the dispatcher and told Paul he was on break . Back in his cab and Hubert kept watching the little girls go by. It was like watching birds. Pecking, playing , flying it wasn't as if they really did anything but go  back and forth…  back and forth…  It was now 3 hours in the blistering heat and the traffic had still not moved. The panties were now soaked in the sweat coming off of Hubert's forehead amongst other things. The girls had been playing for about twenty minutes and Hubert was napping in his car before he went home when he heard tapping on his car window. "This your car?" she said. She told him that she wanted pizza. Hubert saw the other girls huddling and giggling with each other a couple doors down. "Why can't you get it yourself?" Hubert smiled, slightly annoyed. "Can't cross without a grownup" she returned with a sly grin. Jennica was 11 going on 12 he found out. She was old for her age though, and despite the Hello Kitty wallet that protected her allowance (she treated when they went for pizza) and the scooter in the backseat of Hubert's cab, she was better conversation then most of the women he saw. Like the waitress from Dunkirk, New York he had taken out a couple weeks ago. He had met her at the diner outside of La Guardia Airport while waiting for a pick up. She was always generous with the butter that came with free bread and she always, almost always refilled his water without him even asking. That night he took her home, excited at the prospect of something new and unexpected but though she was new, she was tired like everyone else in the business. In the city for only three months and she was already worn with the disaffection that plagued him and anyone who would ever be desperate enough to settle for him. Jennica was different though, growing up in the city, she'd already been accustomed to the shit. The hustle and bustle didn't grind her like it did everyone else -yet. She was beyond the grime and it didn't affect her or maybe it was just that she hadn't reached the grime- yet. However this was special; she was special and for the first time in weeks, Hubert sat across someone who smiled. He asked her if she wanted to go to Coney Island. She was hesitant. This was already a big deal, she wasn't even allowed to cross the street. This whole thing started off as a stupid dare. Unlike her stupid friends Jennica wanted adventure. She had even kissed a junior highschool boy. She wasn't sure if she should stop now. Next thing you knew, icecream in hand, Hubert was driving away. He couldn't even think or morever he just didn't think. He looked over and Jennica, seatbelt strapped across nibblets parading as breasts was nearing real fright. The ice cream that he had bought her didn't seem to be making her feel any better and Hubert clutched the wheel in a cold sweat. He knew that he was only a few blocks away, and that he could still turn around, drop her off. No one would even know; they'd only been gone half an hour, forty five minutes at the most but he couldn't. Hubert tried to turn around but he couldn't. This was the first time in weeks that he had smiled he assumed but in reality it had been months. There were of course the sarcastic grins when one of the guys at the base cracked a dirty joke or the fake ones he mustered when he wanted tips or sex, but it had been months since he had truly, genuinely smiled. Hubert was absolutely not going to let go of the wheel and his feet pushed down on the gas even harder and next thing you knew, he was over the Manhattan bridge. Jennica was beyond being uncomfortable she was now terrified. At first she made mild suggestions that they go back. Being grown up and all she thought polite people suggested and other polite people would respond to suggestions, but Hubert was just still not there. Jennica was crying but Hubert couldn't even hear her. All he could do was clutch the wheel eyes straight ahead and bloodshot. Silence prevailed in Hubert's ears as Jennica continued screaming. Honk!!! At stoplight Hubert slammed on the breaks. Finally breathing after speeding of the bridge Hubert was slapped with reality as Jennica's screams finally hit him. Panicked He threw his hands over her mouth to silence her but she wouldn't stop. Hubert turned into an alley and tried talking her down , saying everything would be alright, but Jennica just continued to stare at him as if he was crazy. She just wouldn't stop screaming and screaming and he grabbed her and held her tight and just rocked her back and forth. In reality it was about a minute but it seemed like an eternity and she was silent. Very silent. Hubert slowly detached himself from her, her skinny arms now limp, her eyes closed and set her down. Death didn't even begin to register. He just thought of how peaceful she looked. He poked her face; no reaction. He poked her again; no reaction. He sat back and slumped into his seat not sure of what to do next. That's when he saw it. The panties, poking out, almost smiling, winking really. He had already done the worst, he kidnapped and killed a little girl. Not knowing what, he did what he did best, he drove. He drove uptown. He figured that maybe he could go upstate and bury the body somewhere. Right and wrong wasn't a factor at the moment, just clear and unclear. Clearly he was in deep trouble and he needed out; he'd grieve later with that waitress he supposed. A hour later and the panties were still poking out, winking at him. Stuck in traffic they just lay there winking. Huberts eyes grew large and the panties seemed to loom towards him, his hand inching closer and closer to them. Finally two of his fingers touched them and suddenly the passenger door was open and Jennica was trying to get out. She wasn't dead after all and all Hubert could do was grab. The panties ripped in the struggle but Jennica got out and ran ahead. Something made Hubert stay. She wasn't dead, and he hadn't touched her (well not really). Something told Hubert to sit tight, lest he get into more trouble. She ran out onto the highway which wasn't moving anyway and she disappeared a couple cars down. It didn't register that perhaps she might tell the cops or that she would have to explain where she was when her parents discovered her missing. All that mattered was that she was gone and there was peace in the car again. By this time the panties were on Hubert's face, shielding it from the sun, but suddenly the heat from the sun stopped. Something was blocking it. Removing the panties from his eyes Hubert looked out of the driver's seat window and saw a navy blue uniform. "Excuse me sir, but are you Hubert Humbert of 225 W 161st?" "Yes" Hubert replied.  "Step out of the car sir"  "What's this about?"  "Do you know anything about the accident up front?"  "Well I can tell you that I didn't cause it" Hubert laughed "What is this about?"  "Are you sure about that?"  "Why?"  "A little girl was hit by an oncoming vehicle"  "Oh my goodness!"  "Don't worry, she's okay, however there was something odd about her". The officer leered into the drivers seat and looked down at what Humbert was clutching dearly. Several other officers made their way towards the car. Beads of sweat were now turning into sheets of sweet on Humberts back and neck and hand. Especially his hand. " What was so odd about her?" Humbert asked meekly.  "She's missing her underwear."   Hubert sat exasperated and relieved in the chair. The room that the police had put him in was air conditioned and even though the outcome didn't seem all that great, he was cool at least for the time being. Jen,hadn't gotten hit by car, at least not very hard, but she did cause a three car pile up when she frantically tried to flag down oncoming traffic. From what she told the police they figured that Hubert couldn't have gotten out of the traffic and after walking down the highway it was only a matter of time before they found him. Hubert had been right though, Jen had understood. She was scared but she didn't want Hubert to get in trouble, she just wanted to go home.  "I would have buried her nice" Hubert thought, with one arm cuffed to the chair. The police didn't see the need to have both hands tied back. Hubert had gone with no complaint, almost relieved. He wasn't a flight risk, so they didn't see any hurry. The girl was ok and the parents didn't want to drag this out. They took her home quietly and let their lawyer deal with it. The lawyer, penciled in the meeting with Hubert for 1 pm the next day- after his noon fuck with the secretary. He was always up and proper to crush any notion of a plea bargain. After ramming Sarah from behind on the copy machine, he'd be pumped to go straight for a conviction. And so it was, and Hubert ended up spending that night in jail. Quiet, the other inmates left him alone and Hubert curled up in a corner and fell asleep smiling. Hubert thought, of Jen's smile. He really would have buried her real nice, maybe in a field in near Poughkipsie. He was glad that she was alive of course, but there a certain comfort in the peaceful look she had, laying limp in the passenger seat. He wanted her there, still , forever and forever his. All he wanted to do was smile, and as long as he pictured her face while he was curled up in the corner he was fine. Soon an eternity of this didn't seem so bad. He was sure that lawyer would want the maximum conviction for kidnapping and Hubert wasn't sure if he even had the energy to say anything in his own defense. What would he say? That she made him happier than any woman could? How could he defend that. Besides, in jail he didn't have to work, he figured. If jail was like where he was now, all curled up and peaceful, thinking about Jennica for the next 5 to 10 years , it suddenly didn't seem so bad.  Across the room, a different story u nfolded. Roran , up for parole, stared at the pathetic ball in the corner. "New fish" he thought and Hubert turned his face slightly and the moonlight caught his grin. Roran just stared. Roran was in for suspicion of being involved in a couple of rapes in Central Park. Women knew not to go down there, but those office pricks thought that they could go anywhere as long as they were white. Closing a huge deal and the firm and a couple of Martini's and you and the boys congratulated yourselves on being masters of the universe. All it took was a couple drinks to really believe that privilege because you were white and male and you hid your fagginess by fucking your wife in the ass after getting your dick sucked by Peter in the office was really justified. Roran didn't think so. Roran was no fag but he wasn't a pussy either. He knew the best way to make those office pricks know where they really stood. He wasn't satisfied with bending them over. A man knows that he's being raped when he's licking your asshole with a knife to his throat. Roran, unruffled and calm all day was drunk with revenge. Sorting mail everday for the past eleven years, he silently hated the laughs behind his back because of his limp. The army had given him honorable discharge but he lost a chip in his knee and control of his bowls in the plane accident. He had to wear a bag all day and sometimes it leaked, but always, always they laughed. They weren't laughing now were they? The reality was, that even though night after night, he would go out, masked, dressed in black and get them from behind in the park when they would make the drunk walk home , he felt better but not good. He felt powerful, less embarassed but still he never smiled. He hadn't smiled, not even faking it for going on a year now. He thought that his face would freeze in a grimace like his mother warned him. Looking over at Hubert in the corner, smiling, Roran felt that jealousy again. Soon Roran was back in the copy room and they were laughing again. Roran saw red, and his own perversions rose up from deep in his belly. It was like watching his life flash before his eyes. He saw the smelling of his hand when he wiped his ass, the wiping his face with a towel after using it on his genitals, the wiping of his bloody dick on the face of those corporate pricks and he watched himself in awe. He saw himself from outside, not from within and then he saw Hubert again, in the corner, smiling and Roran lost that outside perspective and rushed him. Hubert, that smiley faced goat was his and as usual Roran felt better as he usually did, when justice was dispatched.

      Observe the next visitor departing the Emotionless highway and say, "What sort of parting tears were shed?"  Faith blew by my ears bitterly while she Angelically slept. My stapled tongue reeked of profane thoughts and Counterfeit expressions. My buried words, All jumbled up in a large, steaming Pot of Gumbo,  Put her to sleep like 800 mgs. of Valium.  If I dropped  The Hammer  in Las Vegas, Would anyone in China notice? Will the Wall crumble? Will small Eskimo chlidren say  "Farewell" to their sisters before banishment? And will I be able to hear the  Silent applause from handless railbirds?

      Doomsday is near as soon as the politicians go honest. Bad thoughts are more dangerous than Wards, dungeons, and prisons. While most of you sleep,  I lie awake and yawn. My thoughts about the subtle flecks  Of emerald green in her sea blue eyes Casually drifted away towards clarity.  My quagmire of a life resembles A wretched Fox sitcom, A Shakespeare play,  A black and white Woody Allen film. Except that Joey Buttafucco is the lead actor And stands forty-five pounds overweight.  My unspoken silence is a sullen, dangerous,  Listless lunacy that used to turn women on, Those who where attracted to the  Orgasmic gentleness of crafty madness. Cunning souls can be as scintillating as a slice of Junior's cheesecake when digested with a  Side plate of untamed confusion.  Respect the scorns of time and Rebuke the erroneous laws of nature, then Perhaps my quiet dismay will disappear to A titillating place where no traveler returns. I mock the lost ones, Cowards of them all. Clueless ampersands as they stand on a crowded Subway platform in between two genuine haughty artisans.  I've sweat heavily in my weary life, Reflections of my ghostly inaction set against a Riveted backdrop of flames and plumes of smoke. Without a tongue, I speak with a bedeviled spirit Ignoring the weakness that I could cure with a Drop of arsenic, Indeed, a foul murder just mere moments Away from ambitious persons who dare to be more than Blips on the radar screen.

      When I come over The first thing I do  Is walk to your medicine cabinet Count the condoms and  See if my toothbrush is still there and it is  with a confidence that pounds inside you Steady and slow As if speaking  Pushing at my whims Bleeding through my seams it ignores angry 1am hang-ups noontime blowouts as I pray to gods of either/or that admonish me for loving you  grey and unannounced with a desperation that hangs thick in midnight phone calls  "hey" "……..hey" "where are you?" "around the corner"   ……this keeps me going  your phone number something I’ve memorized because of the amount of times I’ve deleted it  our relationship pocket Aces and a shitty flop  bet anyway it’s worth chasing  measure our strengths in increments of failed suicides gasping at arms and thighs like air  Like clockwork the aftermath sings a morse code of secret winks and missed glances  the space between us so palatable  that gossipers choke on their assumptions  memorizing the rhythm of a tango that won’t end until we are both dead so....  I’ve invested in the  Twenty pack of toothbrushes    One for every time I’m too sick to stand too weak to leave too tired to stay too dirty and plain too impatient haggard hopeless confused content  and coming    So that when forgiveness Becomes futile And your thumbs are raw From digging under my skin  Don’t stop ……………I like you there

      (edit/rewrite) Imagine your alarm clock a symphony Heralding tommorrow’s Where you don’t wake up wondering If this is an up day or a down day Without the justification Of nightmares you can’t remember The ones that leave no details Simply a pain in your belly  Don’t get out of bed Until you’ve decided what you will eat Because icecream in the morning Never fails to heal And cigarettes before breakfast Never fail to remind you How bad it can get  And the floor seems so far now Craving bottom Like peace Pangs of lonely hit you in intervals Steady as a flatline  And the bustle of crowds Gets under your skin And you get mad anytime  Someone asks you for anything   the sun has changed colors 6 times already and your mood has changed 9 your body your sweat your fears aren’t yours anymore and feelings are chemical composits  Don’t look at your alarm clock You feel guilty when you do. You had a good nights sleep It’s 2 pm and life isn’t a good enough Reason to get out of bed   your pillows sound like Barry White lulling you back to them at 3pm  Hug them  feel warm And perfect  The grooves in your ceiling Have become constellations.  You can keep track of your movement In how many times you need to Roll over  in your bed  to Answer the phone Grab a book  Right now is the reason You got the wireless keyboard and mouse set   A rested mind Is borne out of relinquished hope  Counting hours like days  Measuring success in failed  Suicide attempts   Ignore the  Hum of the t.v. And aspire to be too proud To pick up a phone  Remind yourself that hard work Is happening    Crave hugs like methadone  And then Relapse  Into tears And fear Beg  for laughing prescriptions   Get through The next second The next minute  each day gets easier And asking for help is a step back  You laugh at silly questions like…  What did you do today?  I saved my life….  And  this as busy as it  gets

      (Excerpt from an actual email response....the names have been changed to protect the innocent...no I'm NOT giving out the un rated version)    [///] indicate parts that have been erased...  Though i'm not in the louder arts collective I'm one of the people whose been encouraged and  helped alot by the people in it...{////} Just because we have benefited from being part of that  "chosen few" does not mean that the practices used to get into the collective are fair. Until recently, the collective was just a social group, so no biggie right? Who CARES?!? Recently it's been making the move towards being a non profit organization.If you want to play the name game, I shall. Take for example, last year's semi's..[//////]. .now i'm not here to single out people (I will it I'm asked to ) but the process unto itself. The  way it's set up is unfair. The fact that there is no set criteria or rules and regs sets it up for corruption. I have never really tried in particular to be in the collective, but i've on many occaisions (Especially when guy left)been turned down when i offered to help out. I know [you] (members of the collective) work hard [///]but don't let your defensiveness steer you away from the point. I'm not trying to attack [anyone] either implicitly or explicitly. Critiquing something should not be seen as a personal attack however if people don't want to discuss this like mature adults then I will attack you personally, especially if you try and attack me that we....let's keep all hands ON deck.I believe that someone who offers something into the collective should be in it and show's commitment to it's ideals should be in it, however I think that collectives need to exist outside of the ego's of it's members and that we as artists should strive to create something bigger then we are. I'm not trying to hate on anyone(in particular).....I have nothing to gain from this and nothing to lose, I'm being objective and adhering to my own concious. [///] So [13 folks]let me ask you something [///]? What about the people who don't? Should THEY be there? If we call for our artistic work to go deeper, question harder, inspire more consistently than our critques of situations must be rigorous as well. We must exercise much more than our egos, we must excercise the art of critical analysis. Can we bring this to a real level? Ask pertinent and sometimes scary questions? Give honest answers? Let's be real here folks, no beating around the bush...... This isn't JUST about favoritism. In fact the question isn't about favoritism at all....It's about fairness..unlike two years ago, there are alot more opportunities  in the poetry game....if you go to nationals, you place well, make connections, you GET jobs, offers to be on def poetry....would mayda del valle be on Def poetry jam broadway if she HADN'T one the indie title AND been on the nuyo team...Sure, if she slaved for a couple years making contacts and doing every which feature she could get for free until SOMEONE decided to pay her? Or, if her poetry's REALLY any good then she should be winning slams? (Uh lest we forget that 13 produces ALOT of good writers but WHERE did 13 place last year?) Face it folks the slam isn't just about the poetry cuz if it was it would be dedicated to promoting new work. It's about alot more than that.It not being about JUST poetry is FINE, there's nothing wrong with that, but don't front like it is.  Sure you can get those things other ways, but not really. Take for example [////]. He started touring at like 18 and had a WEALTH of work (poetry and plays) by the time he got to 13. HE didn't get no one's respect till he made a winning Team. And you know what? I HATED HIM!! (that still ain't no reason to hate on someone) THat's just hypocritical and moreover wrong. At the same time, while I had my own personal shit going with him at the time (and I appreciate everyone who stood by me) i know for a fact HE wasn't accepted. Artistically, socially, politically, we are all looking for something new......I don't think it just has to be new, it's got to be bigger......bigger then just two for 1 drinks on mondays, and definately BIGGER then our egos. I'd want to be in a collective that asks me to step OUTSIDE of myself and give someone I don't even particularly like a chance....because there is a mutual commitment to the advancement of an art.....a commitment to brining social and political isssues into the public sphere.... Something that asks me to stop being rude and be more open to new work instead of reinscribing elitist, condescending, sometimes noirist attitudes that can sometimes be plain old childish. It's mean, its wrong...that's what everyone's fronting to be about  but all i see is hurt asses while y'all sit on the fence... You need to check your self before you wreck yourself

      Ok, guys I JUST saw the Matrix and boy is there going to be ALOT of scholarship on THIS one.....I just had a riveting conversation with my dad explaining WHAT the fuck that movie was about and i realized two things.....1 I could devote an ENTIRE webpage on explaining that movie to everyone in the world who HASN'T read foucault and missed about 95% of the symbolism working in the movie.....and 2 that this was an exercise in bringing the decolonization argument (Fanon,Foucault,Said,etc..) into the public sphere. Granted....most people who see this movie A) won't get it but know that there is something working here that they just don't understand B) Not understand it and Dismiss for being inaccessible or C) Be insulted because the movie was purposely inaccessible. For starters, the matrix was a slap in the face to anyone who hasn't majored in post modern, post structural discourses ( I.E. Michel Foucault...see the link to Discipline and Punish up top) It was a whole bunch of elitist jargon linked by fight scenes that resembled more the nut cracker suite rather then action sequences. It was saying "hey we know you don't understand this but we'll keep you in your seat with extravagent (though SOOOO obviously CGI) fight scenes. THe audience KNOWS it was being pandered too (or at least i knew). This is both good and bad....on one hand it raises the bar and asks the audience to be more intelligent. It says "If you want to know what the hell we're talking about, then read a fucking book" on the other hand, it leaves alot of folks in the dark. IT DOES however bring alot of stuff into the public sphere. It reappriates means and manuevers designed to make us consumers (of nikes and aididas) and makes us consumers again...the only saving grace is that we are supposedly consuming something that once digested is empowered. By manuevering our way THROUGH the matrix maybe we can get out. Before we can bust out of our limitations we must first know them. Ok, so the Plotline was shakesperean, all the name symbolism was working and pretty obvoius, the relationship to philosophers less then so.The narrative thread/thematic line was conistent about ONE thing......THIS( The revolution ultimately failing) is what happens when you allow yourself to be limited by your own imagination. We (oh lowly docile bodies) are simply products of stimulation, only pawns with the discourse of power, however though we can never escape that discourse we must TRY. It is impossible (such as is absolute truth) but we must still aim for it. It is within THAT contradiction that we find possibility, it is here that the anomoly exists, it is HERE that Neo can find hope and it is WHY i'm going to pay 9 bucks to go see the fucking sequel......I too need to release the syncopes from my imagination......but that's a" Whole other Thesis (tai)  "Remember, there IS no spoon"  di

      WHEW!!!! I'ts late and i just had a rivetting conversation with guy and i think it took alot of the tension out of me......working on this stupid page has helped too.....it's ironic how these webpages sort of become metaphors for how organized your life is. It's as if i'm supposed to define who i am in frames and lists and such and by reading this you will somehow get insight into who I am as a person.....makes you realize how much or how few convictions you have. The lines between what you are and what you arent'.......well you feel the pressure of making them more apparent.Maybe I'm getting way to deep into this or perhaps I'm coming to terms with the fact that at SOME point, i'm going to have to commit to certain things and in some cases certain people. I could hide behind the guise of "searching for myself" for a little while, when i was 19 and i was "new on the poetry scene"  (I AM quoting myself, and that ISN'T narcissistic, I just give myself more appropriate things to say then anyone else would DUH!) Certain battles around the world, in my backyard (or nearest open mic) and in my heart are being waged......question is...do i have the balls to face them?

      Ok, ok..........I have a sprained toe and I'm doing my best not to go completley insane? Why would someone go insane over a sprained toe you might ask? Like many other problems in my life, it's never the size of the problem but where it lands. Like my toe, though it's a small injury the fact that i carry all my weight on it and use it to balance myself it's a big friggin deal. The fact that i can't box because of it is a big deal.....the fact that i have ABSOLUTELY NO PHYSICAL RELEASE FOR MY FRUSTRATIONS IS A BIG FUCKING DEAL!!..... "there are two types of people who need anger therapy: The first is the kind who blows up about everything, he yells at the grocer every day for every little thing, the second type of person says nothing and keeps everything inside and then one day shoots 11 people and then himself".....My biggest contradiction is finding out which type of person i'll be :) As the countdown begins to me moving out of my parent's house (AGAIN) i feel the syncope close in on my spirit.......so what does this mean? I guess i'm just going to have to start writing again....and there's all of this drama over at 13 because the same old vet's who have real issues with aging are on the team again. I have soo many mixed emotions about that. On one hand, i've tried my darndest to be able to be friends with everyone while staying out of the d rama ( I have enough of my own) but on this point I dunno, i think it's about time that Diane Roy took a vacation and Diane Wah stepped in. Hearing what guy had to say about his dreams of what louderarts would be.....a collective that would encourage new voices, given how many people are slamming in nyc, you would thinnk that nyc would be the innovators of slam.......how can we innovate if we keep sending the same friggin team every year...on the other hand as a new poet (never been to nationals or done a major competition or show before) I got this pride thing that makes me think that in order to make the team, my poetry should make the stuff that came before me obsolete.....but then again THAT doesn't make sense. If it's good work, it's good work. No matter how old Steve Colemans (www.stevecolmanpoet.com) "Do you want to hear a poem" get's you've GOT to admit that it's STILL relevent and STILL a crowd pleaser. I had the position that it was my responsibility as a poet to also be a visionary, that i must take what i see going on around me and mold it and create something totally new. That's why i haven't slammed this year......I really didn't have anything to say....but then again I realized that I had a real confidence issue......should I not speak just because I don't feel I'm better? WHy should my voice not count? Not be heard? ANd shouldn't bar 13 be a place where I feel comfortable experimenting? WHen I first came to 13 I met Guy and roger and (especially roger) I was encouraged and that helped me out ALOT .....i thought that louder arts was a place where poets came together and critiqued each other positively....no hatin, however as time passed (especially when guy left) egos went ary and people were gettin crazy drunk on HATERADE...I understand what it means to have community but come ON! BEING COOL OR BEING SOMEONES FRIEND SHOULD NOT BE CRITERIA FOR BEING IN THE COLLECTIVE!! That's just dumb! There's GOT to be another way....I've seen sooo many good poets come in and out of 13 but have been shunned just becaues they didn't somehow "fit in" to what the louderarts collective should be .....i dunno WHAT the criteria is.....that's a problem. It got to a point that I started going to OTHER venues to show new work like West Side Rhyme (http://www.westsiderhyme.com/) which had a really laid back, open, positive, non elitist atmosphere....My ego's too big to be threatened by anyone, but just because folks are nice to me doesn't mean that i'm blind to unfairness to others..... that's my 2 cents

I'm starting to hate blogger already, or is it that I just dont' have the patience to learn something new? I'm having enough trouble writing and coming to terms with emotions and all of THAT b.s. to further block the unleasing of my SOUL by NOT publishing what i write (uh oh.....i think that was a shappy moment) So tell me? what IS wrong with regular coffee? Is it too strong for you? Too BLACK!! TOO STRONG!! TOO BLACK!!

      Aftermath Staring Back  Before kicking me out of his class For being  And I quote uppity my teacher asked me curiously who exactly do you think you are? Holding his necktie dear With firm grip Ambivalent  Between homocide  and innocence I let go and stared back I replied meekly Im just me  Diane from queens Raised on rice and beans  Fifth in the line of marching matriarchs in time Four Generations of raging Haitians Three ethnic combinations Too much agitation One half a nation  Ive been ironing MY trenchcoat For 243 years What did you think when you looked at me? That only white people  Can be this creatively crazy?  Im coming from that black bourgoise That no one ever sees Always the first one of the few never to walk these halls of privilege  Accosted by questions Presuming answers of Where exactly is Haiti? Do you speak Haitia? Cause you speak really well.. dot dot dot  Ask me that question again Ill squeeze your balls into pearls  Now both sides of the class Are looking at me like  Im a revolutionary poem Picked from the sky And if you plug me in right  everyone will see the light  But I look back deep down my spine STOP Rewind time  It says that revolution Is that intangible evolution That ever essential Need to see that Youre not  but you want to be free  Thats why its taken Three generations for me to know That struggle is a long ride I wont find freedom in 3  minutes time  Over turning Over changes Over how you know what you want to be By what youve seen But how can history be redeemed  When 95%  of your people Cant fucking read  How? 20 years of family dinners on rice and beans 5 million stories of my family being sliced by machetes jailed imprisoned  for have vision first in the Caribe  to declare themselves free but when people find out Im Haitian its preceded by the word dirty  So now youre looking for your  Revolution In this TOKEN New solution This intellectualized  Feminized Malcolm  X-ample  Im not it Theres no gospel Coming from these lips  I know why youre anxious When you look at me You look into my eyes And see a thousand year of beating me You look at my thighs And feel a thousand years of raping me Now youre wondering why Im  not aiming to please? Youre angry cause I aint down on my knees?  So when I suck my teeth and huff You think of 92 when the LA Riots scared you You think of Watts and dream of me in handcuffs There revolution wasnt  The looting or the shooting  It was just when the wealth trickled back down to us For that no matter how many  As I get To you Ill never be more than a B+  Im pushing away my wallet You can load up your gat Because  I am the aftermath Staring  Back.

      Just rented the first Matrix......I went to three blockbusters today, JUST to find it.....I missed out on the debauchery at 13 tonite....but alas.....school calls. Once these papers are finished.....I'm all moved in..AND i secure a job that doesn't make me want to hold my bosses and co workers for ransom.....that all will be well in wonderland....I don't mind the debauchery so much when i can manage my success in tangible ways like say......saving money, paying rent....etc. etc.? I guess if i can focus on my writing then it doesn't really matter if I'm an asshole?

       For May 20: Don't publicly defy a boss or other authority figure today - whatever you do. If a planned confrontation is scheduled for today, you're advised to reschedule it. You won't come out a winner by going up against command central, but are likely to damage your image and reputation. As tiresome as it is, you're advised to obediently stroke the status quo for the time being. Remember Leo: no matter how brilliant your message, if others are unwilling to listen, you're wasting your time. Wait until a more fortunate moment to unleash your beliefs and findings. This morning is friendly enough - just enough to ratchet up your confidence and seduce you into believing that you can speak freely. Don't be fooled, Leo - mum is the word.

      Ok, ok......it's 1:59 PM and I have JUST woken up.....good news though....i WAS alseep  by 7:15 AM so it's all good..... Roger's party?.....hmmmm...what DO I have to say about that well....basically if you werent' there, then it's NONE of YO goddamn business, however everything else that's getting typed IS 'cause well I'm MAKING it that way...I just finished checking my e-mail and someone just asked me if it was ok to encourage others to read my blogger and BAM contradiction struck again.....Instintively i wanted to hit the reply button and say no,[/////] please don't because A) I don't have the site set up to where I want it yet and I feel kinda nekked w/ people reading it and such....but most importantly is was B) I went ahead, put up an online journal to spill my soul in.... , published it online and gave key people the address so of COURSE i'd want him to encourage other people to read it right ? NO!!! Because it was at THAT moment that I asked myself, "am i really ready to be judged on my actions and my words?" "Do I really want to put myself in a position where my words can and will be used against me?" (answer comes later) Last nite was another watershed moment for me as well....I had a surprsingly great time..It's one thing to be intellectually adventurous....it's a total other to actually follow your heart and your passions AND most importantly your inequities to whereever they take you...and of course to deal with the consequences of your actions afterward. Dealing with the consequences is easy if you TRULY follow your heart and your spirit, because honesty   breeds honesty...... My mindset last nite was a taste of what's to come this summer and I had to ask myself that question again....."Can I handle it?" Can I sustain living a passionate life? Not an ego driven dramatic life but one where I do follow my heart (and my loins) whereever the fuck they take me with no guilt or anything? Being a truly independent woman, I've learned....takes alot more then "staying home alone on saturday nites." I means, sticking by your guns and most importantly sticking by YOUR own heart and fighting for it and defending it....because we ALL know the difference between right and wrong....we just spend our lives rationalizing  our decisions and the other half lying about the fact that we are rationonalizing at all.......  Maybe i limit myself by the limitations i put on my battles.........How much I drank last nite has no bearing on my moral being...how honest i was or wasn't DOES..... and NO i don't get hang overs ever so i WILL be drinking more  P.S. sam vargas is da man

      An expression really expressing the point: Knock his/her thoughts out.  Ok, I'm back...Here's the situation.... Y'all can email me (dianewah@yahoo.com) My foot is STill fucked up but not fighting (http://www.extrememuaythai.com/) is driving me insane. It is turning me into a very violent  person. Yeah not fighting is  turning  me violent? How does that work? I have no place to release so all my stresses unleash themselves within. I'm gonna end up like Adam Sandler's character in "Anger Management" Anyway I've been looking up boxing quotes. Lailah Ali had a fight a couple weeks ago and a friend of mine is fighting this weekend...I'm envious. I'm thinking i'm going back to the gym and monday and just friggin let it out.....wait...I'm slamming on monday....shit.. I should memorize my pieces...by ya'll...Here's some quotes   I dislike violence, nevertheless, the first time ever I threw a punch, I was hooked.    if I have cared too little for the fight itself and too much for dissecting how boxing makes me feel, how it changes and challenges me (my omission from the original), Im happy.    MOST POWERFULLY -> its still okay for girls to grow up believing what they weigh and wear is more important than what they know and read, say, and do. Sports can cure that. I am fighting stereotypes.     ANOTHER WINNER -> and the fitness industry propagates and then profits from our imagined inadequacies.

      Trying to stay on top of this blogger thing is proving to be harder then I thought. If I can't commit to my blogger how I can I commit to anyone else?.....but then again blogs don't keep you warm at night...you just go to bed with clearer thoughts. A friend of mine told me once that it was hogshit that you needed to be alone to find yourself ONE and TWO? you're probably going to spend the rest of your life finding your self over and over again (if you're at all interesting) so what's that going to do for you? ARe you going to be alone for ever? No way...life is a road trip and roadtrips are only as fun as the people driving with you.....they get off (hopefully  more than once) and get on...again...it's the ride... NOT  the destination. Living with a bunch of ballerinas has taught me one thing: The rich are not ANY quieter then blacks and puerto ricans. They're entitlement issues make them just as loud if not louder. Anyway.....here come my movie reviews.   Terminator 3  Ok, for starters...it was "visually stimulating but ultimately pointless" I spent the entire movie  waiting for the machines to actually rise. That's where the drama SHOULD have been, where the stakes were etc....anyway what it ended up being was a really really elaborate trailer for what will be T4. So they WILL get my money. My only solace was that i saw it for free by sneaking intothe theatre. Another review  28 days later  This movie was also visually stunning. Shot in video (to give it that grittier realistic psuedo mockumentary feel) It was pretty cool. If you are a fan of zombie movies in the tradition of " Night of the Living Dead" ,   Evil Dead2, Dawn of the Dead. ..etc... etc... you will appreciate the evolution of the zombie. Here the zombies are scarier because as opposed to zombies prior they can actually RUN and they scream too so they are not ones to be messed with. One plot device that confused me was figuring out the difference between those infected who had died and those who were still alive and looking for Human meat. I also didn't understand the zombie motives. In Re-Animator and Return of the Living Dead they appreciated human brain...here i don't know if the motive is to eat humans or simple blood lust. I think it was the latter because the name of the disease was RAGE, a human form of being rabid. Anyway it wasn't life changing but it wasn't bad. Go see it...especially if you have a girl/guy friend who's a scaredy cat. It's better experienced in a dark theatre....  So now the movie reviews are done. I'm doing those i guess for practice? I'm going to have more detailed ones real soon. I figure maybe I can make a living as a movie reviewer. I wonder how Roger Egbert got into the business...Mental note: Email him.   I'm on duty at the 13th St. amidst about 130 13-19 yr old ballerinas...Lord help me please. They have no conception of the term "insides voices". Oh well.... I have some beef chow fun that's calling me......till next time

      ok, ok I'm back....why was I gone? What brings me back? Well for starters I have an actual 9-5 (on top of my 6pm to 8 AM gig) and this one actually pays money and then again i also get to live on 13th st which works. So now that I'm in a corporate job (well not THAT corporate, it's with the University.) I do have to maintain hours that definately impede on my humanity. The work day should be no more then 4 or 5 hours long.....they REALLY don't need us there that long....they're just trying to break us iknow it. Anyway....in an attempt to LOOK like i'm doing work...feverishly typing away....I can maintain this blog AND my job and you can get to investigate into my life and basically poke around.Sooo...what am I working on? Well I'm still not fighting...I have to get physical therapy on my toe so i have no way getting rid of my agression...I'm going to see 28 days later wit Fish...Stay tuned for my review of it..Live long....prosper

      Top 5 Things NOT to do in Manhattan if you're a woman   WARNING: Doing these things will get you catcalls, dinner invitations, marriage proposals by the dozens. You will be able to have 5 male heads turn and gaze at you in unison and utter a  synchronus "GOD DAMN!".  5. Wear anything that accentuates more than would a potatoe sack  4. Wear a Conversational T-Shirt (i.e. "I love jazz...., Where's Waldo?,Or "If you're close enough to read this shirt then you are close enough to suck my dick!")       I've found that you will be getting responses to whatever witty thing your t-shirt says from men and little      old ladies.   3. Make Eye Contact      In New York It's understood that this is either an open invitation for sex or worse yet a threat    2. Smile and look like you're having a nice day      Though it seems harmless enough and will elicit cool things I miss about small town living like being somewhere "Where everybody knows your name?" and eye contact? It also elicits responses from every preacher, talkative crazy homeless man etc ....  1. Do any of the above at night  Ok....So I'm ranting......I'll leave it at that

      Why is it that when you sit around waiting for a call it never comes, but the second you leave the room, go out, or whatever that's when it comes it? It's like watching a pot on the stove....it will NEVER boil..... the second that you decide to walk ...the bus shows up just as you walked far enough away  from the busstop to NOT be able to run back...it's just Murphy and her goddamn laws fucking with me again. It's also when you decide to get over someone and leave and that's when their ready.......I try to take advice from great relationships before me.......Sting (and his wife), the Huxtables(fictional but who cares), Goldie Hawn and KurtRussel, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, Guy and Salome? (Ok so maybe it WAS me goi ng through the archives) I guess you may not know how great it is until 20 years later when your dick stops working and your boobs....well we won't talk about that. .....Anyway....patience is a virtue.  On to other things, last nite was the survivor slam. I won. Some liked. Lot's hated. 'nuff said. I do me and I'll continue doing me. I dare anyone to stop me with small minds and bad karma.   Leo July 23-August 22 July 22, 2003           Astronet Daily   This is not a good time to fight authority. In a question about right and wrong, the answer may be decided by who is more powerful. Be careful how you choose to express your opinion.    it's NEVER the right time to fight authority....but that's what makes it so fun :)

      " Looks like you've got a case of the monday's?"   Say that to me at 8AM and watch how quickly I will knock you out. I've learned two things from my years of experience in corporate America 1) you must seriously watch your caloric intake when you are sitting in front of a computer 7 hours a day 2) The sound of you typing feverishly away doesn't always make you look busy. It just sounds like you're on Aol Instant Messenger and THAt's the reason whyyou know how to type 90 wpm.  Anyway...now that i've been thorougly reprimanded for not updating my blog I now realize that I have a distinct responsibility not only as an avid blog user but also as a writer/historian/poet/ (sometimes public) intellectual. what does that mean? I've got to sound interesting and at least pretend when I'm not .  It's cheaper then getting therapy and paying somone to listen to my b.s.  So.... I'm slamming tonight at 13. Have a I prepared? Don't ask me that. It's my first time slamming in a while and if you're not doing it for a while of course you get nervous. Once it starts I'll be ok, but i'm doing pieces I've never slammed before so.....oh well... On the open mic you don't care what folks think and for the most part I don't care what people think period... but for me the scores help me get a better understanding of whether or not poeple  GET the piece. If you got it and you just straight up didn't like it......give me a low score... I can deal with that ...if you really liked it ....give me a high score...but it's the in between scores that annoy me....they are the..."I'm sure you said something really deep but I don't really know what it was score" That means that I have to go back to the drawing board and rework.  Fish talked about "true poetry?" ...uhh there's no such thing. I've got one word to disprove that...: SHAPPY. Case closed.  Poetry ...or at least spoken word is/should be about communication with the audience. You could be saying the dopest shit...if theydon't get it though...then what's the point? Publish a chapbook, so someone can read it /analyze it over and over again. Communication is a two part process. It's not just about talking....it's about taking the time out to make sure that your message got delivered in the way you intended it. What happens after that is up to the audience member/listener. It's like that in love and relationships i'm learning.......saying stuff isn't enough....actions/verbs speak volumes louder ....when emotions are involved whether in friendships or romantic relationships...they tend to blur the ear. Take for example a situation a friend of mine is in. He's been trying to break up with the same girl for a while...she just aint' listenin....I told him that he can't lead her on.  If he cares about her, it's HIS responsibility to make sure that she gets the message.   Anyway enough ranting about that.....my variation on a theme....here goes  Sexual things that befuddle me..........  Why don't white people wash their hands in the bathroom? When you are with your girl, she goes down on you, you finish, then you kiss her.  Why?  (uhh, fish you should have been with enough catholic girls to know that a girl needs reassurance that you don't think she's dirty for doing that...Guys are funny that way)   Why is bi-sexuality in women more accepted then in men?  I don't think it is...guys have that fantasy that two women really want to be  with THEM but that they just foray in lesbianis.....ummm...in reality it's not so cool for alot guys...competition is competition...now that have twice as many people too worry about their girl cheating on them with. And I personally never had an issue with bi-men...it's just that few men in general are bi.....  Why is there dialogue in porn? (for guys who watch with their girlfriends)   Why are women more visually enticed by a flaccid 9 inch penis that gains half an inch when hard but not with a 6 inch flaccid penis that gains 4 inches when hard?  Personally I'm impressed by a 4 inch tongue   Why do fat guys have small penis? Not that mines is small!!!!!! LOL   I do n't know    Religious things that befuddle me   Why are born again christian boys so attracted to ME?        Boyfriend Questions that befuddle me   Is it always really about the chase? If men don't actually emotionally mature till they're 40   hmm..I thought I had some more but I think I'm less confused than I thought..... Film at 11

      Ok, yesterday was the best birthday I've ever had. In fact it is still going on. It's more like a birthday week so to speak. It's an excuse for everyone around me to party like it's THEIR own birthday. But seriously folks, I've never felt soooo loved before. Fish and Lenny (Fenny) thanks for the roses, they were gorgeous, shout outs to Jillian and Jay (Jayllian) Tatiana, Angie and Judie (aka Ta-Anjudie) for throwing me the ill surprise thingy.I really believed that there was a "strange smell coming from my room that i HAD to come home and check out". My peeps from Ryan J.H.S. Beavis's (Tamz, Bridgette,lissette), My brother and my mom and my dad.....and and and  and...   "This moment is bigger than me"  "This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women that stand beside me - Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett and it's for every nameless, faceless woman of colour that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.    that's the speech i DIDNT get to give after winning the Survivor Slam.... ahem ahem

      And in the darkness......friendster them! Jesus christ...this friendster thing totally exploits every vulnerability you have. I mean Come ON!     Add Friend  To add Tani as a friend, please enter Tani's email address or full name.   Continue only if you really are friends with Tani.     If you really    are friends with whoever? then they spot check you and ask for said "Tani's" approval and validation that you IN FACT really are friends? of course you wait for your email box to fill up with "TANI IS NOW YOUR FRIEND" messages in Yahoo. So was Tani ever really your friend? Is she NOW your friend because she's comfortable enough with you to let other friendsters know that  you two are in fact MORE then acquaintances? Because who you friendster with is a window into who you ARE as a person. From now own, I'm going to make sure that I'm clear on my relationships with people. I mean it's only fair in this world of capitalism that EVERYTHING including our relationships with people should be codified. You know? arranged, collected, organized, classified so that we as humans and our emotions can be properly commodified. YES ! take what is intangible, indeterminate, evanescant and package it and resell to us what is ours. Basically, all our insecurities.......   "Fat," the mechanic says, "liposuctioned fat sucked out of the richest thighs in America. The richest, fattest thighs in the world."  Our goal is the big red bags of liposuctioned fat we'll haul back to Paper Street and render and mix with lye and rosemary and sell back to the very people who paid to have it sucked out. At twenty bucks a bar, these are the only folks who can afford it.    Yes...our vulnerabilites exploited and sold back to us....the wheel goes round and round...and it's addictive!  Why? Our need for validation. Nothing ACTUALLY goes on on friendster.....you see how many "friends" you can rack up....  oh well I'm going to check my email and see if anyone's my frined :)

      It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  Excerpt from the show  CrankYankers   Yup, Gary had me watching that and from now on all birthday'ers will suffer the wrath of the most annoying phone call to be gotten at 6 AM on one's birthday. Last night was great. Fish and Lenny (who will now be known as Fenny (ala Bennifer ie. J-lo and Ben Affleck) or other famous couples such as Guy and Salome aka Guylome . Well Fenny got me flowers. I've never gotten flowers before. I also had another birthday first but that's none of your bloggers ya know? I was drunk as all hell (just three drinks but they were special birthday drinks. THANKS MAUREEN!!) AND i did a poem. First thing i said of course in true rebel fashion was "FUCK THE TIME PENALTY" and implicitly fuck everyone else tooo..... I've had it up to here with the hateration. Nuyo took it last nite and deservingly I thought. They're energy was fresh and so were the faces and you know? that's what happens when the rotation changes every year. Implicitly there's a faith in the poetry community to keep producing new poets with new work, THAT system supports newness and change.....whatever...we've been down THAT road...SO back to my birthday....Personally i've been traumatized by birthdays past so now i don't even care these days. Besides, the people i care about know i do the other 364 days of the year and vice versa so by the time any holiday including a birthday comes along it's kind of redundant? It's a marker though and if you read yesterday's blog you can see were i've been , where I'm at etc. Today's not a day for reflecting. It's a day for returning voicemails from everyone wishing me a happy birthday. I didn't know i had this many friends...or maybe I was too self absorbed to realize it. I have a full wonderful life and I'm really happy for it.  I think that's it..... maybe more later  Diane

      It's the day  before my birthday...(If you don't know how old I am, you won't find out here) I'm celebrating tonight because ...HELL it's two -for 1 drinks at Bar 13. It's cheaper to celebrate tonight as opposed to tommorrow. I woke up this morning around 6:30... I had come home the night before from spending the weekend with  some of my girls from way back. We had a girls weekend/b-day bash/graduation bash/housewarming. It's always funny looking at old friends, remembering the way we were in junior high....how much has changed...how little has... remembering what we said we wanted to be and looking at what we became. Suprisingly there are no real surprises.....I don't know if it's because we knew each other so well that there wasn't room for that or .....well I don't know. I stopped giving birthdays too much importance a long time ago. I learned not to expect too much lest you get disappointed. For me now it's just a marker. I was surprised when I blew out my candle and my friends screamed "Wish for somethin!"....i paused for a second, looked around.....thought about everything i've been stressing about lately and said...."No need, i have everything I want" and that felt SOOO GOOD   Birthdays are markers.......I've spent this whole year feeling like I was in suspended animation, like i've been moving and going nowhere.....I'm in school but graduation seemed so far away....I've been writing like crazy but have not performed as much as I should and I have no published work to show for it....I've been planning my dissertation but not actually doing it...so on ....so forth......It's like I've been driving on an open road and you don't realize how far you've gone because from the point of view of the car everything just looks the same........ I couldn't have said that last year and meant it......Last year i was standing on the  brink of my own imagination , now I'm peering over it and it's not so scary after all.......I just found it that yet another friend is having a baby....my best friend just moved in with her boyfriend , another friend is getting married.....I must keep reminding myself how young I am, I have time, just be patient and enjoy the life that I've provided for myself..... So some people have new years resolutions...I have birthday ones..here they go...  1) Drink more water (1 liter a day)  2) Eat my vegetables (At least once a day)  3) Keep working out (You're doing good!)  4) Say at least one positive thing to someone everday (Always use good karma)  5) Stop reading my horoscopes (Make your own fortune)  6) Trust my own instincts (Stop asking for advice, you know what to do!)  7) Continue to talk to myself in the third person (I told you! it helps put things in perspective!)  8) Talk less, Listen more (Yes, you're a work in progress EVERYONE can learn to do it)  9) Actually LISTEN and not just wait for your turn to speak  (You'll get to know people for who they really are. They usually tell you if you listen closely enough)  10) Continue to have faith in humanity, Diane. It's what keeps you going, it's the reason you're living. Keep the faith and follow your heart :)  Happy Birthday to me :)  diane

      I have never wanted to be involved in politics before and what I mean by politics I mean the traditional ways and means or our psuedo democratic system. Take for example our voting system   Many people believe that by not voting they are making a point about how they feel about the present state of politics. Then there are younger people who haven't given up hope in the system but we know that the differences between the two parties are so minute that you're not making enough of a difference if you do vote. Not voting doesn't solve anything, but does voting solve anything?    Does it? Yes I've registered to vote and YES I voted Nader in the (2001?) elections. Did I believe that I was partaking in a truly democratic process that gave my voice importance? No, not at all. Growing up in a home where the public sphere was as big our whole house and whole family, the term " discussing politics"  never meant discussing what political candidates were running, or who had a better chance of winning and whittling down our discussions into the confines of the myopia of "the issues". It was never JUST about the defense budget or JUST about roe v wade it was more about moral issues. So tell me, how can we talk more about broadbased moral and humanitarian issues when our entire electoral process is based on lies?  So why did I chose to vote?  For starters I was 19 and my own discussions were myopic unto themselves. I also voted to make a point; (at that age you do stuff like that). It was to point out that while I consider myself Haitian- American, while I hold on to my parent's history/culture and my parent's parent's history and culture, that I was born here and I should be affored the rights that my ancestors (blacks in Haiti and the U.S.) should have. I feel jipped. I voted because my vote SHOULD count and in the last election we see how much it didn't. I hearing the jackasses on campus scream,"If you don't vote, don't talk". I DO vote but i DO understand how ludicrous the whole process is. For starters the electoral college votes NOT you. And second of all if you have enough money you can buy ANYTHING in this country including the presidency.   America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values.A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.There is nothing except a tragic death wish to prevent us from reordering our priorities, so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war.   -MLK    Historical experience indicates that the crucial element in changing policy is a national mass movement.   - Howard Zinn  That's why I want to be involved in supporting Kucinich for president. Not because my vote counts but because it should. My father always told me that people don't give you respect you earn it. Same goes for power. No one's going to listen to you , you must make yourself heard. Our votes will not count unless we make them count......

      So I promised myself that I'd blog at least once every work day...... this will be interesting....  I was supposed to go out last night but i suggested that we hang out and go for a walk because I couldn't afford anything more than that and my friend was just like "don't you work? Why are you broke?" and then I realized that I've worked three jobs this summer and my ass is STILL broke, because in this economy you can work but you're lucky if you ACTUALLY get paid. It's like getting paid is a luxury. Before I go on a rant about the New School University and their ludicrous beaureaucratic practices I'll tell you how i can work like a jamaican  (I've got 10 jobs mahn...I'm a steamboat worker, a cook, a security guard etc....ala  In living color)  1)I'm an RA in one of the dorms with no kitchen AND i don't get a meal plan. THat means that I have to eat out for almost every meal i have and if you live in manhattan it gets expensive. THEY do not pay me money, or a meal plan or anything... hmmph  2)I work in catering on long island. They paid me up until they lost the wedding accounts for the summer but I'd work only once tops twice a week with them and all THAT money went to food  3) I work at the lang (www.lang.edu) office of admissions and THEY are supposed to pay me tommorrow! omy goodneess! Anyone want to go to dinner? I can afford it! and drinks! Who wants to get drinks! email me!  Because I'm going to get a check (and others subsequently and on a regular basis)  I decided that I'm going to make my first major independent purchase a new computer! YES! I'm going to need it for grad school and such. I'm starting a database (hopefully gooing online) of research in my particular field (who knows what that is yet) but basically i'm going to have a database of ethnographies, and oral histories and papers etc....It'll be a website but much....much more....... hmmmm.... so I haven't done this ina  while...any technobrats help me out here! I haven't been a computer nerd since i was an engineering major in h.s. and MY soo much has changed. THe computers i'm looking at now would have been NASA supercomputers back in my day! It's all relative I guess. I'm still paying for my dell laptop which is obsolete but right now i'm going to get an affordable desktop....they've gotten cheaper. I can get a good brand name computer for UNDER a  thousand bucks WITH 80 GIGABYTES (can you believe it?) of HD space....  hmmmm

        Hunger hurts....but starving works    Ok, ok....so i played hooky today. I woke up the the most amazing migraine. Sparring is NOT for the faint of heart, it is strictly for those with hard head so to speak. After reading Ed's blog and actually being at the send off last nite and also cutting off some romantic loose ends so to speak I feel like i've come full circle. Though I've tried not to let it get to me I realized how much cutting off I've done this year, cutting myself off from things that were holding me back and as much as I try to stay with people and things that have given me what I thought was a safe space, a comfortable space a space that would push me and it's not. Like many things it has been holding me back. I realize now how much of myself I've kept hidden or just displaced because it didn't fit into the spokenword routine of chapbooks and slamming and featuring etc... I've sort of become the has been spoken word artist that never was.....  Sending everyone off last nite i was asked yet again why i'm not going to nationals for the record I'll respond. 1. I ain't got  the loot 2. If it was that important to me right now, i would have found a way to get the loot 3. I'd rather go if i was peforming; I can get really really drunk in NYC. I don't have to pay to do it in Cha-town 4. This isn't a group that I feel i belong to. I have friendships with singular people but i've never been really good with groups 5. I've got shit to do like my thesis  Speaking of which, I've made today very productive. It's amazing what ephedra does. It's like caffeine but you can focus and you dddon't need  a prescription like it's ritalin. Ok, I've never been an avid drug user but i am an aspiring over achiever and well you  gotta do what you gotta do. My to do list for today reads more like like the Brain's (Pinky and the Brain) to do list for every evening.... "Try and take over the world" hmmm......  I called up some of my old professors from Fredonia State University and I'm setting up some pre-lim teaching seminars in order to  get my feet wet for grad school. I'm sitting here typing like the mad professor that I want to be and it feels great. Now that I'm not romantically distracted I can refocus on my work. My romantic tendencies are so cyclical and so binary. It's either I'm devoted to you or my work or my work or you. I can dangle between the two or at the very least you must be content with a close second place. oh well.....I'm super duper hyped and super duper focused......and speaking of which i've got to get back to work.....  I should add a comments section....

      Ok, I just started back up in the gym. I think i emasculated some poor little boy. It was like my third day back in the ring and I got paired with this 16 yr old boy. Granted he was big, but he was kinda new, not really experienced and they had him sparring against me. Now mind you I'm not a bully, I wasn't going hard or anything but I gave the poor boy a bloody nose and he  was just like "I don't hit girls" and my instinctive reaction was "BULLSHIT YOU JUST CANT FIGHT!". Part of me was like alright, I understand. I would never encourage a guy to hit a girl but the other part of me was like , "We're in a gym and this is what we do."There doesn't seem to be that middle ground. Either guys don't know what to do with you and won't fight you or they hate you for being there and they pound on you. Anyway, bottom line is that I've only sparred with one girl. I've only sparred with guys. They hit me and hard but I'm always kind of afraid that they aren't going all out and that i won't be prepared when i actually fight a girl. I know that I'm bigger and meaner then most girls (in the ring anyway) and I wonder how i'd feel hitting a girl. ...... ....I'll think about that another time.....  I've got other things on my mind ...  OH YEAH!! I saw American Wedding I laughed I laughed till i cried I almost puked.....  Don't go there to be enlightened see it to be grossed out  beautiful debauchery..... nite nite little ones

       "but devoting your life to social justice has it's perks. it gives meaning to your life.... It let's you know that through all your trials tribulations whining tears embarrassments and failures that you done did good, you know? Martydom is romantic to folks like you and me" -I.B  Isn't it? I lost my wallet on Friday. In an effort to use my time productively, I decided to reread Brave New World (aldous huxley) in an effort to reorient myself with my senior thesis. For those that don't know....I'm (trying) to do a work called  The Evolution of Tyranny in America :Plantation to Prison  Sounds fun right? Wrong. I'm like what, 22? I've been working on this since i was 18? it's not gotten any easier....ok so maybe it has. The project is overwhelming but it's the one thing I've truly and completley fallen in love with. Deeply committed to it, I refuse to give it up though life seems to keep handing me curveballs that deter me from it. Alone, with my thoughts and my books.....it does give me warmth at night. Romantic? yes.....but we all need a little (or alot ) of that romance. OF course there were the issues with financial aid, Not getting the RA position which would have aloud me to stay in the city and for ONCE in my 3 years back in nyc JUST focus on work and not the rent, and the MTA fare hike and my landlord. Great  materials for poetry and short stories but REALLY distracting for cultural anthropology. Or maybe not.....wanting to find a space to be quiet and theorize the poetics of the space that I'm currently living in is well .....I'm choking. Trying to get it out and the confines of poetry are doing it enough. So what is this rant? More like "reflections on a lost wallet".  You wouldn't believe the amount of money i lost in not checking behind me as i got up from the train. I wonder of public space would dictate to anyone who found it to look into my wallet, see that i was a broke ass student and be moved to return to me my hard earned money but while i have faith in humanity, my faith is not dogmatic. The chances of that happening are slim to none. Humanity is defined by it's frailty and inability to live up to the moral code it imposes on itself.....but MY ASS IS STILL BROKE and broker than before. I lost a monthly metrocard (209 dollars)and a bi weekly paycheck (you do the math)....hurts don't it?

       "Maybe that was why poets and artists were needed by the human race: because everyone felt like an alien, but poets were the ones who knew how to express it in words."  Erica Jong, Parachutes and Kisses   "And that's our gig" says my poetry professor. "To translate the unspeakable into words" and as I think of my solemn promise to write everyday, I see how ridiculously hard that is going to be....to go to that place where everything is always a metaphor, where you can smell life in your pores  (and that last line made sense). See it's not that i'm not dramatic enough for poetry, it's that I never got comfortable with that side of myself. Maybe it was early childhood catholicism, maybe it has something to do with the strict code of conduct (which i apparently never heed to ) that comes with being Haitian. Ever since I've started this poetry thing, I've had to defend it in my classrooms and namely at home. I've had to defend why this writing that I do is important, why it's relevent so I fall back, on anthropology. An archaic discipline that will give me the credibility I still so desperately ache for.  So here I am. I 'm starting my ethnographic research next semester and I plan on taking meticulous fieldnotes that keep a certain scientific rigor while engaging the reader at the same time. So this is my gig...turning otherwise useless data and attaching it to various claims in order to translate it into the larger social sphere.......So yeah...that's my gig and still I have the nerve to ask why poetry is relevent? Why do i keep it to the side like some boyfriend who albeit great is ugly and i'm embarrassed to introduce him to me friends (Sex in the City: Episode 5 '1998)?    And then Advanced Poetry on Mondays and Wednesdays and I find myself in blistering arguments with those who criticize "slam poetry" (also code word for black/urban poetry). People stating (though they've heard maybe 3 performance poets in their entire lives) that it doesn't "stand up on the page". So I pose this question,  What exactly does Standing up on the page mean?   In my academic poetry classes it means that  it's abstract, and obscure (something my white male peers love) and has nothing to do with anything. In short, it's lacking in contact and disguises it with a strict attention to form, however there are lots of poets (half of the poets at bar 13) who's work stands up well on the page and hits  home alot quicker. So in that case it seems as if "standing up on the page" is just code for INACCESSIBLE. This means that if my moms can understand the poem at a first , second or third reading it's not good? One of the major differences I've seen has been the immediacy of slam poetry vs what's recognized as "academic poetry"    Any comments from the peanut gallery?

      Ok....So i spent a total of like 5 hours fixing this damn blog thing and honestly just being wowed by the wonders of html. I have a jones (yes i used the word jones) for computers. More like, I was one of the first MIT hackers in the sixties in a past life or Cap'N' Crunch and Emmanuel Goldstein's lovechild (See back issue Phrack Magazines) but there's just something about "the beauty of the baud". I get on on these suckers and hours go by without me even knowing it. My generation grew up with computers and it's not until you get a certain self conciousness of it (founded by having old fart friends who think a beeper is new age) you don't realize the power it can give you....ok fuck that.....For tonight I'll leave you with a bit that inspired me when I was a wee computer phreak.... Though my take on it has changed over the years the basic concept of free information for all, ideal albeit is I dunno....romantic? maybe ...Poetic? definately :) enjoy    The Hacker Manifesto  by +++The Mentor+++ Written January 8, 1986   Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...  Damn kids. They're all alike.  But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?  I am a hacker, enter my world...  Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...  Damn underachiever. They're all alike.  I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..."  Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.  I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...  Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.  And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...  Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...  You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.   This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.  Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.  I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

      I'm taking an advanced poetry class with none other then Sekou Sundiata. It's kind of weird for me because evidently we're going to be studying alot of "performance" poetry in class. It's weird because of where I am in the contradiction between student and artist. I say contradiction because the chasm between "academic poetry" and what I pay 5 bucks to listen to at nuyo/13/bowery was/is large. I don't/didn't know where I fit. On one hand, I started writing because of the influence I had from poets like Alix olson, Rog, guy, lynne, stacey ann ....on the other hand the practice of studying and furthermore objectiving living artists is (for lack of a better term) kinda weird. Especially when you drink with them, hang out etc..For example, I'm supposed to do a write up of The United States of Poetry (produced by bobby holman) and it was tough not inserting all of my little personal antectdotes....On the other hand I welcome it as a wonderful oppurtunity. I guess the weirdness comes from my lambasting of slam while i'm in the scene but how much i defend it's democratic nature while i'm in class: exiled at both ends of the string. Most social critics are critics because they don't do the art. They don't write, make movies etc...they are far removed from the process thus most times being less sympathic in their critique only concerned  with the outcome. Just something to think about. Anyway, there's this exercise (which y'all should try) which invovles reading your poem backwards and seeing what you get. Simple, but effective. Because I've been writing in the 3 minute time frame for so long, I've felt stuck in it, conciously and sub conciously writing 3 minute pieces (though ironically I aparently have NO RESPECT for the dreaded time penalty). So in celebration of my blog being back up, getting back into poetry and a newfound dedication to artistic rigor here's a brand new non-slam piece. The title comes from the childrens' sci-fi book   urlLink A wrinkle in Time .  A tesseract is basically a cube squared. In the context of the back, a tesseract also allows you to bend time and space. It allows you to travel from here to wherever by making a "wrinkle in time".     Tesseract    cake super chocolate triple layered piece of double fudge  a shower in the rain before the cognizance of thunder  3rd dimension beings living on a 4th dimension planet visiting the 5th is luxury  what if a trip to the moon  cost $1.50  what if space was a minor detail  what if time  made the comma the semi colon the period antiquated after the climb                                            (do...mi...sol...) into the perfect the fifth  there would be no distance to make the heart grow fonder only  you

      but so much has been on my mind......just this to leave with  Who's Colored? by http://www.maineiac.com/ethnic/whos_colored.htm  !  When I born, I black. When I grow up, I black. When I go in sun, I black. When I cold, I black. When I scared, I black. When I sick, I black. And when I die, I still black.  And You white folks... When you born, you pink. When you grow up, you white. When you go in sun, you red. When you cold, you blue. When you scared, you yellow. When you sick, you green. When you bruised, you purple. And when you die, you gray.

      Why you wanna stick me for my papers? In true new school university tradition i am totally leeching off of nyu's facilitities. while NSU computers are way better, NYU is open (at least the basement is) 24/7. Call it leeching? I call it getting what i paid for he he he... Just finished the first draft of my senior work proposal (at least as much as I'm gonna get done tonight) Just got to spell check etc. tomorrow.....Saw rita dove with m.c, rich,lynne and roger. It was good. Ashamed to say it but it was my first time hearing dove's work. I don't know, I think i just assumed that she was some sissy mainstream poet but she was actually pretty cool, her work any way and she seemed pretty level headed. Being around such a fast life and such in your face work, there was a certain elegence and happiness that i felt in her work, an appreciation for life. in short i kept thinking "so this is what HAPPY  poets write about " lol......anyway...it made for a rich nite of chit chatting with m.c. and rich. my first time really getting to hang out with either one of them and also just hanging out with people closer to my age....it was cool...of course poetry was discussed and i think of where i was three years ago...just coming onto this scene, where i was how far ive come how far i've receded. This being the twilight of my undergraduate career IS a time for reflection , artisitically as well as personally. I think thats why this film project is becoming sort of a docu-history of that. While there are some people i'd rather leave out for personal reasons as a documentarian it's part of my history and part of slam history.... i was watching brown sugar last nite (corny ass movie) and basically this girl was talking about being in love with hip hop and how that was a metaphor for the man she loved....weak WEAK WEAK ass metaphor but i understood the basic concept and kind of related to it....at least in the context of slam. documenting it is alot like documenting me....i can recall so many moments by doing a timeline of the poets i discovered as well as the poems i've written.   "And sometimes i put them [poems] in little piles and walk around and seeing which piles they want to fit in" Rita dove at the New School University on talking about how she bundles her poems together before making them into a book.  This documentary so far will be that.....different interviews, different performances. They will be "little piles"....i just wonder how they'll get bundled together good nite sleep tight don't let the bed bugs bite

       Unity of contradiction or known in marxist terms as a dialectic is the relationship and/or interdependence on opposite things to exist. I.e. black cannot exist unless it has white as a reference point and vice versa. That moment itself is an anomoly or part of an  imponderabilia,  a semiotic, something that can't be defined. In short it is the present tense, something that is constantly fleeting...like the anticipation before a first kiss.....That moment is...    Unity of Contradiction  And now.... is forever and tomorrow my life will be "I've felt this before"  I know it... there's a formula to get back like crack it's  "never.....as good as the first time"  like Sade it never ages  So dare me I dare you to  Live in the world of ballpoint pen no erasers no corrections in the first tense where passion meets constance where prisms split into reflictives  so breathe into me only once convince me that this  ...is enough that you are more  than this air  is forever..... is neverending and tommorrow .....it will make sense in the morning    goodnite

      I'm still in the computer lab.......The first draft of my Senior Thesis is due this Friday....10 people out of my whole senior class(of a hundred) have handed it in...Next on my to do list after that is finishing up my syllabus for Rikers (it's on its way  urlLink fish) , and then maybe get a friggin life......so?   Top 10 Signs You're Burned Out  10.You're so tired you now answer the phone "hell"   9.Your best friend calls to ask how you've been and you immediately scream "Get off by back, bitch!"   8.Your garbage can is your "IN" box   7.You wake up to discover that your bed is on fire, but go back to sleep because you just don't give a fuck  6.You have so much on your mind that you've forgotten how to pee   5.Visions of the upcoming weekend help you make it through Monday   4.You sleep more at work/school than you do at home   3.You leave for a party and instinctively bring your briefcase/bookbag  2.Your palm pilot exploded   1.You think about how relaxing it would be if you were in jail right now   he he he....on that  note I'm working on this little project....you might have heard of it? "The Evolution of Tyranny in American:From Plantation to Prison". I was told by fish that it's a little Panter-ish.....I take his criticism with a grain of salt....ANYWAY it's my lifes work. When I die, I can say I did this and that idea is what I think seperates writers from regular people; we define our lives by what we produce. Fucked up? a little....this is precisely why most professors i know have trouble dealing with regular things like life? love? walking and chewing gum? I don't wanna end up like that but I fear I'm getting close. The more i study people the less I seem able to interact.........but that's a WHOLE other thesis....taking  urlLink mr. gonzalez's lead  Here's the whole book meme so foar ( Meme: copy somebody else's list, delete the authors that aren't on your shelf, and add some authors you have - keeping the number at ten.)   Dawn Saylor's List:  Neil Gaiman Michael Chabon Jack McCarthy Douglas Adams Philip K. Dick Sandra Cisneros Lee Francis Erica Jong Jhumpa Lahiri Jonathon Franzen  ( i have none of dawns books)   Guy Le Charles Gonzalez:  Lawrence Block Carl Hiaasen Matt Ruff Ed Greenwood Jessica Rydill Howard Zinn Gary Jennings Eduardo Galeano Willie Perdomo Patricia Smith  Mine...  Roger Sanjek Arundhati Roy Rafael Campo Ai Howard Zinn Jonathan Kozol Frantz Fanon Karl Marx Mao Tse Tung  Madeline L'Engle   peanuts anyone?

      Who ARE the six people who read my blogger everyday? It's not much but it's consistant...show yourselves! I can only think of maybe three people who read it and I only know two people who signed the guestbook.  Last night I had the weirdest dream......I was part of the matrix team (morpheus, neo and trinity) and there was a bunch of us there(Imagine everyone at 13 dressed in tight leather toting machine guns) and we were in this apartment waiting to have a battle with the "bad guys". Anyway , we were walking in to a trap and I know it and I was scared as shit......see folks? THIS is what happens when you watch t.v. and eat before sleeping!   more later.....

      .......or maybe not....but I AM the one mostly likely to go on a killing spree in my office...Maybe it's my own idealism or maybe it's my ability to see RIGHT through bulllshit ego/power trips juxtaposed with my morbid inability to hide that fact that i think that you are a "Worthless, spineless piece of shit" which makes it difficult for me to prosper in a corparate environment. It's 5:38 pm and I've just rushed out of the office counting the seconds till I can get a fellowship that will wisk me into academic bliss....no rent: I'll live in the dorms no bils: I'll live in the dorms no tuition: I teach  no expenses:I get a stipend for being cool ............ahh.....the blessed fellowship but back to reality. No matter WHAT office you work in, there's going to be politics involving egos and (metaphoric) phallaces that need to be stroked because well.....people are just fragile like that. Just ask THIS leo......but the thing is...a creative mind is not built for corporate america...corporate america is built on greed, lust for money, self loathing, pettiness and above all competition by any means neccessary.    "Thats what happens  you put a bunch of Alpha's on an island..........it's as if their brains are in a syncope.....An alpha would be miserable doing Beta work" -  Brave New World so no matter WHAT office you work in you'll have   but why am i complaining? It could always get ....... urlLink worse   Anyway.....at least last nite was fun. Went to 13 ( I know ).....saw Taylors feature, which I enjoyed very much. I HAVE to go see Teacher! Teacher! on saturday if i know what's good for me...shit....speaking of which I was supposed to go see a play tonight (like THAT's gonna happen). So i spent last nite drinking (Maureen, you're too good to me)...well drinking implies multiple drinks...I had two and I was gone....and it was nice not to give a shit for a change and just chill, listen to some poetry (good or bad it's inspirational) AND i learned something....ok well i forgot everything i learned last night but let me tell you...props help! I wish Taylor was my teacher....anyway..in light of the lesson we got last nite , I leave you with this   Dilbert's "Salary Theorem" states that "Engineers and scientists can never earn as much as business executives and sales people."    This theorem can now be supported by a mathematical equation based on the following two postulates: Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power.  Postulate 2: Time is Money.   As every engineer knows: Power = Work / Time   And since: Knowledge = Power And: Time = Money It is, therefore, true that Knowledge = Work / Money   Solving this equation for Money, we get: Money = Work / Knowledge   Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity, regardless of the amount of Work done.   Conclusion: The less you know, the more you make.

      The sun rises on yet another monday morning...... I'm trying to sound excited but it's failing miserably. I sound like a fog horn and it seems like this ebol like cold is "going around." Colds are like my period, when I have it everyone else seems to have it too. So what is special  about today? I'm on my way to poetry class and I'm about to get one of my "slam" poems workshopped, I wonder how that will go. I volunteered to get the Rikers site at   urlLink CWP  I hope I get it. All of this year and next years research is based on it. I  don't know why I want to work in the prison industry....actually that's a lie , I know exactly why I want to work there, I'm just a little apprehensive. I keep getting speeches from friends and parents asking me if i'm crazy........maybe... speaking of callings Joan of Arcadia is going to premiere this friday? I wonder if it will be any good   film at 11  diane

      Just so folks know, I am putting up poems as often as they come, my goal is two a week no matter how they suck. I'm trying to humiliate myself...wait no...i meant build humility. It's just an exercise in producing work. Well i realy think i did it this time, i bit off WAY more than i can chew. I have a tendency to do that, Try to do everything at once I mean. I mean paul robeson is totally my hero! He managed to go to law school during the week while playing pro football on the weekends, learn 23 languages, be a major figure in the left during the twenties and thirties, be a major actor and singer all in his lifetime. He did everything and did it well. I wanna be just like him or Oprah...I've decided that Oprah is my new hero. A big girl with big dreams (like me!) I mean i know it sounds corny but something about her Cover on O(her magazine) AND on essence as one of the most powerful black women in the world...i dunno..It did something to me. See, I'm a simon de beauvoir kind of girl in the sense that growing up, all the ultra successful people i looked up to were men. I didn't have enough female role models, not to mention black women. As I grow into womanhood...i dunno it's been hard....though I have a mother, i really don't so it's been extra hard trying to be a woman who's not trying to be a man. Anyway.....Oprah is rich as hell but it's not that, she did it on her own terms , in her own skin. She seems well..............nice. Condaleeza Rice was also on the list. Albeit she's powerful, she's the anthi thesis of what I want to be. She's a friggin sell out uncle time right wing ......well i won't dog a sistah THAT much but i don't like her. I have to go do work...i don't know how the fuck i'm gonna make it through this week since i barely made it through last week. I don't have time to write but i'm making time right now because the 15 minutes i spend writing in this blog, well i need it to keep my fucking sanity. This movie thing is getting SOOO big so quick. I'm putting a year time line on it an di'm getting a crew. That's just fucking it. I'll do the interviews myself but GODDAMN!....read my fucking poems and comment please

      WOOHOOO! i was watching the game  last nigth as i started to edit some of the footage that i filmed. Lesson 1...ALWAYS STORYBOARD even if it is a documentary 2. Final cut pro is cool but 6 hours go by QUICK. Well every domincan/spanish person in ALL of persons must of been on the 8th floor UCC bulding (all 5 of them) and it was a great time, with only two folks rooting for the redsoxs. Now normally i'm not a huge base ball fan but after catching a glimpse of the Cubs MAJOR fuck up i got interested in the series. I felt bad for them and  i DO believe that they are cursed, you have to be to have fans THAT stupid. Thing is you can always get into a series and surprisingly enough the game last night moved with SUCH high intensity. I kept thinking to myself "Yanks calm the fuck down" They were swinging at everything that moved and by the 4th innining they were sweating bullets. What i didn't u nderstand though was why Pedro Martinez look so damned shook by the fifth inning..prolly cuz he knows that the yanks are pro's and that they will NOT go quietly in the night. All the redsox had to do was fuck up ONCE and the yanks would take advantage of that and that's what happened. What's his face should have been out but the other whats his face trips over himself and suddenly MAN ON BASE. After that the whole game changed and I said to ALL WHO DOUBTED ME!! that the yanks would win and that they'd turn it around in the 8th and i was right....i didn't expect 11 FUCKING INNINGS! though. I finally had to leave after the bottom of the 9th cuz it was getting really late and my ass was tired and i wanted to go home so i figure i'll find out who one at penn right? I get to penn (which is like 10 m in away) and they're in the 11th inning! i'm like you're kidding me right? All of penn station was empty except for crowding at the two bars down there. (I have issue with that but that's a whole  other blog) so now there are two outs and i'm like SHIT my train is leaving! so i opt for the train.....as soon as it leaves 12:18 someone gets a call on their cell that the yanks won and the who train goes CRAZY!! mind you i hate stupid, italian/beefhead valley stream long island folks but it was nice for a bout a second to be excited about something across race/class and gender.......to be rooting for a team....and now i know why my dad is so into sports........He alway says that outside the sport there's always racist shit going on and such but inside....the drama tends to be more colorblind..it's just about the game. I don't neccessarily agree........but i see what he means.......and that's the last you'll hear of my color commentating....this does NOT mean monday night football on the regular :)  with the outro music d roy p.s. Sorry about the cubs mike ;)

It's more then a river y'a'll . And two? people go see Kill Bill. Terentino has done it again, i'm afraid to say. This movie is all my girl hood fantasies........i won't say anymore except go see it. Anyone who wants to  talk about just how straight up AWESOME this movie is, comment on my guestbook. Anyway while i'm at home and i finally have this god awful house to myself...maybe i can get some  much needed work done......maybe some writing....maybe i'll get the balls to make a fone call that i need to make.....romance and intimacy are not my strong suits....

      Ok, so it's 5pm and i'm in the computer lab and I SHOULD be doing homework (I.e. the webpage i was supposed to finish and logging and capturing some video that i shot this weekend) but no i'm on blogger. You know what? who cares? One, no one reads this thing anyway and two i need a release. I commute to friggin manhattan 7 days a week and its really taking a toll on me physically, spiritually, emotionally.....anyway this morning i had one of those dreams, you know the kind where you don't want to wake up at all and you've been in this moment for so long ...........yeah no details needed; it was romantic. Let's get something straight, unless i can figure out a way to turn the 24 hour day into 36 hours, i can't be in a relationship! I know this! it's impossible! but still......there's the pang that i can't ignore that's been ringing in my heart....i have to have the strength to walk away because i certainly can't make the commitment needed to make it work. Oh well.......so i want my cake and eat it too? Is that SOOO bad? I finally find love and i can't fit it into my schedule?that's life? I have to keep reminding myself that this isn't 16 candles and that timing is everything........i'm babbling so i'll stop.  Community word has been AMAZING! it's really helped me delved deeper into my creative process and has helped my writing tons (when i have time to do it.) I know for sure now that i'll be working at Rikers and that will be an interesting experience. I'll get to work with Fish though so that will be great. I'll also be working with Keito and Claudia. We are all such different people with such different styles it'll be interesting to see how it pans out. This is an exciting moment for me....I've been trying to open up into new circles as of late. The 13 crowd has gotten well.......incestuous? It's like the colored version of friends and Cheers............I need some space, however during our presentations I really got to see what other work people were doing including MFA folks and visual artists. I got to see them in a way so much m ore intimate then drinking at a bar. Anyway......I'm also taking myself more seriously as an artist and writer, consequently I'll be taken more seriously. I don't think i considered myself a real "artist" before this, just a naturally creative person. It's a privilage i  tell you. Growing up in nyc , i realize that i'm becoming the people i started at on the F train in junior high...it's a weird finally. It's like adult hood is sneaking in through the back door. NYC is coming alive to me in different ways as well. It's been interesting the way the city has changed for me as I've gotten older (maybe wiser)........................More poems coming soon  diane  p.s. Send your prayers to  urlLink bassey  and her little brother

      I figured this was long enough to qualify as a post. It was a response to Guy's rant on guns if anyone cares to join the discussion.  I'm feeling you on the gun thing.....being a (not so young anymore) woman living on her own in brooklyn, I seriously contemplated getting a piece. After 6 months of living in my apartment the whole neighborhood new that A) I was single no matter how many times that I told the guy at the bodega that i was married to a very big man and 2) that i was young ( Ilooked it) and that i went to school ( I had the same schedule every day). This was good in the sense that there WAS a sense of community to some extent ....but being in my position anyone could get that info and THAT made me a target. Think I'm paranoid? a year later when i did a feature at Rikers , this guy kept telling me i looked familiar....thinking that it was some obscure porn reference i ignored him, then he says "Now i know where i know you, you lived in Floyd Patterson's building. I saw you walk to and from school everyday." Mind you he was doing a 1.5 yr  bid for smoking weed on his front porch and i recognized him as part of the group of guys that did, thing is we never spoke and that "community" could have easily become something else. His crew on the corner of my block was one of at least 6 crews on six different stoops that i passed on my way to the train  everyday......Young girls alone are targets as are old women, the elderly in general anything......It IS a jungle sometimes and especially when we have para military nazis......i mean cops out there ready to shoot first rather then serve and protect it feels kinda scary and you feel powerless to defend yourself.....from ANYbody...

      It's my sunday ritual.....a minimum of 8 hours spent in the library, maybe i'll actually catch up on my school work this time. I've decided, i'm taking tommorrow off....from class anyway......I'll spend my day in the library only to reward myself with a movie afterwards. I've been workshopping my poems the past three weeks with sekou sundiata who's teaching my Advanced Poetry class. I've never felt so naked in my life, and I've seen soo much how spoken word has definately limited my progress as a writer. Coming down here to nyc being heavily influenced by alix olson and stephen coleman, well it's led me down a path of kind of ignoring some of the respect for language I used to have. They do what they do and in my opinion they did it well, but in my struggle to find my own voice i find that it parallels my struggle to find myself as woman. I never liked barbie dolls and i looked up to bruce lee and mohammed ali. My heroes were Paul Robeson and Malcolm X, when asked what I wanted to be when I grew up I always said James Baldwin. See a theme here? All MEN!!! this has always (and moreover lately) proved to be kinda  a quandry, struggling to find my femininity (who even knows what that is ) through the lense of masculinity. My own hang up...sure.......still sorting through it? will be for the rest of my existence. Maybe it has to do with not really having a mother.....at least not in the traditional sense. My mother..........well she's a biological accident ( I hope) and if I have anything to do with it then i'll grow up to be nothing like the prissy, selfish, borderline that she is............and part of me wants to be. Part of me knows that she's the only biological link i have ................and part of me needs that biological link ................i just hate what it's linked to. So what do i do? I lambast all things stereotypical about haitian women, the bouginess, the need for a man to do everything for them...............Christ this confusion is well? confusing.....i'm all over the place. well back to poetry...........infused in my poetry is the flowery conceit that is the 5 year old girl from south jamaica queens who sat in a corner and made up stories about the town of little blue people that lived in her ear......and the cynicism of the 19yr old forced to shed her rose colored view of the world and come to grips with the depths of how ugly people can really be........That naivte has go to get squashed.....but so does that cynicism.where's the happy medium?   On a happier note.....my mind has been full (duh?) of business ideas mostly. As graduation looms over my head (As well as my impending but much dreaded adulthood) I keep thinking of lifestyle/monestyle changes. I must open up my own business.....more film at 11..Someone needs to use this computer  diane

      OK Just so y'all know.....the revolution?yeah...the one all you lame ass poets keep talking about? Yeah THAT one it's  here. In fact the first show is at 9:00 AM tommorrow morning at the Union Square theatre... yes....that's what I'm talking about. Matrix:Revolutions is out tomorrow and for those of you still upset at the second one A) read a fucking book(I'd reccomend Baudrillard or Foucault) and B) get over it. I'm not dogmatizing the matrix like it's some sort of manual for life ( If you want to know more about the world you're currently living in , I'd reccommend 1984/Brave New World for THAT.....) The matrix IS a good movie and I think that it at least aspires to bring it's audience up to ITS level then come down to the audiences (Though one might argue that it did do that in the first one).  enough ....i gotta go to bed nite nite new poem in the AM

      Finally......after 3 different fones asurion insurance company finally came through. I have my phone it is working properly. Now let me tell you, when you buy a phone you will eventually break it or lose it especially if you use it alot, this is especially true if it's at all expensive. It makes sense to pay the xtra 3 bucks a month  (at least for a year) and then just get a new fone in case yours breaks down. Well ok, i admit it maybe i  DID abuse my fone a litte.....so it was scratched but that didn't mean it had to completley die on me! the v60 i's are SOOOO OO Fragile! anyway.....i'm around y'all can call  diane

       Lilith Sets it straight   I tasted   death  in your sweat the first time we made love  Your hips wouldnt listen to mine, so they shouted.  Loud enough to flip us over Me in you hands on chest fucking to my new rhythm touching my womb jealous youd never been born    * Note: This relates to the story of Lilith who was Adam's first wife.As the story goes, Adam kicked her out of Eden because she wanted to be on top during sex. After he kicked her out, Adam asked for a replacement and God said that he'd have to sacrifice a part of himselfand that's why God made Eve out of Adam's rib.    urlLink more on lilith

      (or Reflection on a Gift of Matricide # 3)   I. On Cancer  Take heed its violence distracts you from its beauty its silence its speed  Listen And maybe it can teach you to survive In ways you didnt imagine More inside you Then I ever was Is the invasion really so foreign?   II. On Mercy   You gave me Nyquil anyway  Alcohol isnt for five year olds   you warned   I was afraid Id get drunk  you knew better Then to let the dryness in my cough persist Youd only let  one drop of blood actually hit  the pillowcase  sleep mattered more    You figured all Id remember in the morning was peace and how to swallow again     III. On  Dignity   Make a grand entrance You will be remembered  Exit early enough to be missed Its nice to be escorted  By someone who understands Pain for beauty will know that pinched feet require aid and that a taxicab ride 4 blocks will be necessary  Hair falls flat in humidity Leave a half hour before it does    *Note: This is one of the poems in a series entitled "Reflection on a Gift of Matricide. If the meaning eludes you, yes it IS about euthenasia. I was just afraid it might be mis interpreted out of the context of the series

      I had a dream about the matrix last night.......I have a lot of apocolyptic/post-apocoplyptic dreams in which I either save or am trying to save someone. Usually it's my little brother and his inane questions and absolute REFUSAL to listen to me always get him (or us killed). This time it was someone else . This time we were on earth when the sky was about to get blackened and sentinels were flying through manhattan, so I gather my dad and my aunt and hop into the car and head for canada......before I do though, I call this  other  that i  sometimes  find significant and he's on some " well I wanna ride this end-of-the-world thing out and see where it takes me.....I can't settle down just yet." So I have to convince this idiot that running off to Canada and having sex for the last 3 days of our lives COULD be fine.....so finally he piles into my car with all my other relatives and says to my dad "Nice to finally meet you Mr. Roy" like I've been keeping him from this! now you see why i get mad at people just from dreams I have? I know I have isssues and someone's in the doghouse......  P.S. sorry I haven't been blogging but i've been working on something even BETTER...an actual webSITE equipped with articles, poems, research etc.....and naked pictures of me (for a fee)

      Ok, So i am writing this at the dawns early light  (which for me would be 10:18 am) BEFORE i read anyone else's blog ....  So last nite........ Well for starters it was Fish's acentos feature and I trekked out from L.I. to support it.  Believe me, I need more then one reason to make a trip to the city.....i don't like leaving my house unless i have to but that said I did leave for a couple reasons just most of them involved Fish. First off we do community word at Rikers and  I can't avoid his ass, second he called the day off to make it REALLY f-uped if  I didn't show and third...... He's one of the most sincere and honest poets I've had a chance to chill/work with (save for maybe guy but guy i'm gonna still be mad at ya cuz fish has actually READ that "evolution of tyranny in america " thing i sent you monthts ago) Especially with all of the b.s. that has surrounded Bar 13 since Finals last year , the egos, the double speak and the lack of HONESTY, the one thing that I respect about Fish is that he never gets bigger then himself and he doesn't reserve brute honesty only for the people  he DOESNT like. Personal feelings will not distract him from what he knows in his heart is right and is never afraid to say it. It comes it in his work and it comes out when I'm working with him. He's always trying to learn more and never forgets where he came from. He  has a healthy dose of self-confidence without ever being elitist and THAT is why i came out to support fish. I represents something that's still true or at least when its not tries to be and I respect that. So before this blog becomes a whole Fish-a-ton i'll do the Acentos notes ala D- roy D- stroy.  The open mic started off well enough with the talented, the beautiful Maya Azucena. Ok for all those who know me, you'll understand. FUCK TAI FREEDOM FORD! I know longer have a crush on her. My new crush is Maya Azucena! God, who said this last nite.....it was in a poem or mayne Guy said it on the mic but it was something like "......Sometimes we all need patron saints, people who've gone through this path before in order to guide us.." or it may have been Eric's poems.  She's got this really young face but you can see experience and strength in her eyes. She's something that  alot of women try but don't get right......she's poised and i  wanna be her when I grow up. I actually spent the 10 bucks and bought her CD and after getting my wallet stolen  AGAIN i don't have that kind of loot to spend but I figured I'd use it at Rikers during a free write session. I think that's how I met her (as in got to talking to her) ....it was through that show and she rocked it so if she can't get there in person i'llbring the CD.  So now it's a Maya-a-thon..... So there were folks on the open mic. Off the dome it was the librarian lady (janie?), me, eric, m.c. siegal, rich (rockin that sexy ass cap. he looked     like a young pinero if pinero had stopped doing crack and started eating) hmmmmm.... R.L the gifted one , juan diaz (two babies talking about their penises), i can't remember his name but he's ALWAYS at t13 and does the old school rhymes. He did a piece about the  greatest day of his life it was real real fun. " My ex wife got married to this guy named Tony/ Now I don't have to pay alimony/etc..." you get the picture :)   Now getting into the Feature......I know Fish was nervous. He's nervous because he takes his shit seriously. His parents were there and Cousin Ed was there and he wanted to prove something not to us per se but to him self and that was fun to watch...He was doing his thing taking us on instrospective trips into his past with his father.....third person stories about a young peurto rican woman (she sings) and his loud vibrant odes to the bronx. Poems about parole (she adjusted her 15 yr on the job bun) and about redemption (12 hours) Shit i was about to cry with him UNTIL i had the intense urge to turn around and grab the bartender by her neck,  and shake her until her fake titties shifted out of place. This bitch, who I might add was quiet during Maya's set.......so quiet in fact that she didn't want to open the register in order to give me my change) was a loud , attention seeking, racist, immature, bitch. It starts off with her answering  a phone call VERY  LOUDLY "RONI I KNOW ITS  YOU WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT"...... Roni is on my shit list too. I caught a quick look at Rich who attempted to go over there and tell her to shut up be she was not having it. She continues this shit all through the night, answering numerous calls loudly, engaging in loud conversation and pouring Ice. Now we could all say that she was just seeking attention (which is no excuse) but she had an accomplice. The idiot with shit pierced in his mouth. What the hell is that anyway!  Whenever I see people with mulitiple tatooes on their face and piercings i always think  " Yourself cannot be found in sterling silver". She made comments about how white people weren't welcome in Acentos and i think everyone remembers her saying "well what about the white Irish!......no one's representing white irish!" and the room feel silent, not because there were not white people, but that one presence made  you not what to call attention to your own whiteness.I live in valley stream long island. I see this kind of shit everyday. I live right on the border between a staunchly italian neighborhood and a west indian one and i see what happens when the line gets crossed. As soon as I walked in the FDNY cats thought it was perfectly ok to try to hold my hand etc. ( i don't even want to go into it). Honestly if it wasn't ACentos would have been the intro to a gangbang. It reminded me of Resevoir kind of. It's not as bad is this situation, but i won't go into that bar unless it's a monday night and there's about 20 other colored folks around me. But last nite it was our space and it was cool .It's not my show, it's not my venue, I'll keep my rants here, and i won't punch her out ( but i won't tip)   The night ended grand with a express train ride with Eric and his friend from Germany ( WHO I LOVE!) he gave me this chocolate.....magic chocolate....with sweet milk chocolate and macadmeia nuts. Johann gets a warm shout out from ME. Ever tasted European chocolate? It's got the same powers as the ice cream truck........it CAN trigger world piece.....  and on that note I'll leave a poem....... I alway try to write when I'm  at an open mic/reading. PEOPLE ....not good poetry, not bad poetry are inspiring and that's where the sanctity of the mic is kept.  I want to fucky you  and use it as revenge  make having to sleep in the wet spot my motive  I'll use " Sorry officer I was busy picking out hospital gowns for our first abortion. No we haven't picked a date out" as my alibi  I want to remember exactly how palms fit perfectly into thighs  the specific order of sighs that spell " I missed you" more explicitly then first letter in Arabic aleph nuanced enough to recognize silence in it's alphabet  I want to pretend that i was only practicing love at first sight because you were not scheduled to come till after grad school I was not scheduled to come till after dinner but not everything works out as planned.  I wanted to meet you in the future when experience caught up with the smart girl in Freshman Engilsh with alot of potential and turned her into the women i've been investing in deferred principles as i paid her interest in attention    I want all of this  I want none of this  I can no longer write love poems  to myself in the third person with you as the intermediary I shouldn't have to look to you to see right through me  take the Co out of dependence make my baggage light learn to stay home alone on saturday nights   so cut me make me woman i wanted to meet you in the future now i sew up my heart with salt laced sutres.  First loves rarely  become your last so presently I write you into the past.

      WHATEVER a film shoot i was supposed to direct got cancelled and my Finals are in jeapordy now. I trooped all the way to rikers only to find out it got cancelled. People have lives and its the snow that's bad but the way the city gets shut down. The city of new york pretends that we never get snow thus using this as an excuse to not put out a cleaning crew until the whole damned place is shut down. 10 inches is not alot! but it happens every year! It's all part of the corruption in this goddamned city that is getting completely unbearable! They NEW that it was going to snow. A little bit of shoveling the first day would have at the very least cleared the main roads and some maintenance would have kept it that way. I used to live outside of buffalo y'all. THIS kind of snow aint' shit . It would snow like this for days and days but the roads were clean. THere would be a foot of ssnow on the sidewalks but the roads were clean.  The city saves a bunch of money by waiting till all the snow falls, because they don't want to pay the city workers the over time required to clean the streets. THIS after they increase fare hikes! bastards!      I said before that they NEW it would be this bad and could have prepared, but then again they knew about 911 too, what did they do about that? case and point  d roy

      To Do today 1. Finish my finals.....ALL of them 2. Develop a working pedagogy for rikers inmates (by 5pm) 3. Pick up lighting equipment for Sunday 4. blow dry and curl my hair 5. find time to update blog for those who wish to know those pointless details about my existence 6. continue a working friendship with Major Ex version.3.1.1. circa Summer '03 and accept love with falling for it  It's 12:08 and i'm doing a running time line of my day. i woke up about a half hour ago while dreaming about today's timeline wondering how i could squeeze 27 hours out of a 24 hour day while at the same time trying to figure out how i can squeeze a dollar out of 15 cents. Yes, the same logic applies. Last nite i started RETURNING calls at 11:45 pm when i got out of the library, met my dad at 12:30 to get a ride home and went to sleep at 2 am after stopping for some chicken. Gary asked me last nite if it wasn't just a bit late for my weekly diner all nite rendezvous with my dad, i replied that in a house a with a bi-polor,manic with narcissistic rage who is controlling and obsessessed with our eating habits, fried chicken doesn't fly in peace. This sleep involved all the conversations I'm either to busy or to afraid to have with people in my real life only to wake up to a FUCKING BLIZZARD!!   oh the weather outside is frightful but inside is so delightful     Timeline needs to be redone to include weather.  sidenote: LEARN SPANISH!! i told rich this the other day.... "I like my men like my coffeee, con leche   and my  [   ] like my [   ], con alma"  that coupled with the really , really cute group of dominican boys (new transfers at parsons school of design) that hang out in the computer center with me.  (one of which i helped with a paper last nite wooohoo!) spanish definately needs to be learned...oh yeah and the bilingual classroom and some shit like that would be useful too  MOVING ON!! with the timeline........my day begins at 6:30 am usually and ends at 2 am the next day. And y'all wonder why i drink on mondays, however in about 3 weeks this will all be over. Next semester I only have class on Fridays coupled with Rikers on Friday nites. I'm actually going to be getting school credit for going there and interning at community word, so that means that  I'll manage to take 18 credits and have to write only ONE paper the whole semester and have any real class on friday afternoons PLUS i graduate. Yes the "youngster" is finally getting out of college, so get the lolita (roger) fantasies out and over with. if i get this job i interviewd for, i'll also be moving back to manhattan  and that will be interesting. I vow if i move back to the city i'll go to Acentos  more. i also vow that i'll work out and i'll quit smoking. After that who knows...... I really want to relocate, like seriously relocate not jersey  or westchester or the bronx I mean get out of this city. New York kids rarely if ever leave and i'm afraid if i don't my twenties will be a blur and i won't know what happened. I've got freedom, before long term committment , before kids , before job with loads  of money......i've got to fly and on that note  good bye

      Last night i heard probably the DUMBEST thing i have ever heard in my life. "So, Diane why should I believe your truth vs. a truth on t.v. (i.e. GW.) and i replied because "I have a stake in the truth" i should have finished the sentence with a triumphant "JACKASS". This is the exact same kind of crackpot bullshit logic that goes on anytime politics is too be discussed at resevoir. There seems to be no room for it once you swim past the egos. "these poets, they errr like-a to take de blue pill yes? they like the matrix, no?" quote the great Johann (who brings me delicious gifts of chocolate from germany.This was my most insightful comment  last night.Interestingly enough his powers of perception were keen. His lack of fluency in english probably increased his powers of perception because he was able to see right through the bullshit coming out of oscars mouth and see right to the [disgust?] in his heart. I can blame my hubris on my youth, what's your excuse? Fake time penalties will not save you this time. Your true colors come out in moments like these and at some point you will be outed by the same people who encourage your hubris. Don't end up like narcissus, drowning in your own reflection.  moving on.......  I know what brings people to 13  every monday nite....it's nice to go where everyone knows your name, and they're always glad you came however  i don't want to go where i can see the troubles are still the same but i still go where everyone knows my name   i foolishly believe that's it's bigger  then itself and over and over i'm shown it's not. .....maybe i should troop it more often to Acentos...... but then again i may knock out that bitch ass bartender....   "champagne for my real friends" "real pain for my sham friends"  Vielen Dank ist das meine zwei Cents

      So it's done....finally done. I have an actual website... It's not ready for  full coming out party and I have to go over some of the poems I have there because they might be old versions of somethings but damn I finally have the elusive  urlLink WEBSITE!  For now it's being hosted on the newschool server and who knows how long that's going to last. Guy, you can finally delete those e-mails cuz you should be able to access what I sent you on the website. (check first though ) I want it to be this online library of my writings as well as those I think should be readily availble. It's mostly for me but y'all should have a good time and it's a good a thing to have after a show , when people want copies. It's not all that it could be just yet but soon there will be a merchandises page , picture page, movie reviews, maybe even a webcam....the thing is it's there so enjoy.... there will be a guestbook soon

          Sorry for not posting but my blogger has seriously NOT been working!  anyway....lots of stuff has happened in the past week i'll fill y'all in later  but until then    You are a Tortured Conceptual Artist.  Your fellow postmodernists call you an anachronism, but you've never cared much about the opinions of others.  After all, most of them are far too simple-minded to appreciate the nuances of your work.  They talk, while you are part of a lived tradition.    urlLink   What kind of postmodernist are you!?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Ok, so I shot my movie. Not the way I wanted to , but it's shot. I'm going to see what I've got and ask for an extension and just take what I can get. Anyone who knows that.... I'll be in this computer lab all nite..... you SHALL be updated... ..oooh oooh! Lauryn's on..."Forgive them Father"  The eX-FILES  Who watches "sex in the city?" raise your hand...you know of what i speak. I've got it, a Mr. Big, that one elusive one that got away, the equation that will never solve itself, the insecurity that will rear it's ugly head on wedding days and honeymoon nights...  I'm simply resigned the fact that our lives will forever be linked, we'll always find a way back to each other. I'm sure i could move to Cali or down South, start a new life, come back years later only to find at the two of us, alone in a room together = heat hotter the magma..... I suppose somethings are biochemical, they have to be. You KNOW when you've gotten over someone. You don't think about them and moreover you don't think about not thinking about them, that's why it's even more surprising when these pangs hit you when you see them again. "Old reactions to an old feeling"  I think not.....what if all it takes is their presence? I've dated and dated and there's a process.....sooner or later it gets tired, it gets stale, kisses lose their sizzle and then you get tired and you get out. But what if the sizzle will never go out? What if you are flint and I'm pressure? Together we'll always make sparks. My friend has one of these.....she calls him "Crack" because some people are addictions. You see the havoc they wreak on your life but you still can never let go. This is why alchoholics don't simply slow down their drinking, they have to stop completely. Like cigarrettes, I'll quit him, as I always do, months at a time, sometimes years....... but i know that the air will never get thinner thick with lust and longing and I'll hold my breathe as long as i can but eventually i know  i'll breathe

CHRIST!! what the fuck am i going to do....the show must go on as planned but how i don't know....i better start shoveling

      It's 1:28 and I have yet to learn to go to bed early...I will once my workouts get more intense...my body can only take so much. It'll help when it gets warmer. There's an amazing view from my bedroom window. The snow is blanketting the city as I speak. I know  full well that tomorrow morning will be the coldest day of the year but that doesn't worry....the present tense is too enrapturing... forgive me this is weird......scurrying like a mouse with her tail cut off, its been so long since the quiet has slowed me down long enough to let me hear my own life unfold....shhhh...  I just spent an hour talking on the fone with my ex.........and it didn't hurt. Once I spent more time listening to him and loving him for who he was in the present.......it was easier...looking back I realize how little I actually listened, how often I interrupted and how not in love I really was. I was too wrapped up in feeling out of control to ever appreciate him for the man he was as oppopsed to the man I wanted him to be which was simply a man that was an extension of me.......I was young so whatever....On monday there was this poet ...i forget her name...you've seen her....or at least her poetry....the kind that talks about men who've done wrong......Point is...women are always looking for the right man....the prince charming who's going to whisk you off your feet and tell you who you are and how you want it.... but what goes into being a good woman, prepraring yourself for the one you were destined for ?  it means investing in yourself and your own dreams because relationships are like gifts and if you define yourself by the man you are with what do you really have to offer? Instead of always searching for what he's done for you lately , what have you done for yourself? I'm ranting..........and existing....in this moment...the glimpse of the woman I hope to be one day...patient...observant and above all loving and unwilling to bend to the shit life has to offer......broken hearts are lessons in the fact that you're just not loving hard enough yet.

      The scariest words to hear at 8 am are WIND CHILL FACTOR. According to MYahoo Weather it's technically 9 degrees but it feels like -2. I DON'T KNOW WHAT -2 FEELS LIKE AND I DON'T WANT TO! Luckily I don't have to go to far but I will be in the financial district and I don't know if it's colder down there because of the water, but i DO know it gets crazy windy down there. Alright, most of you have already left for work so I shouldn't be complaining but it don't make going out there any easier..... be brave be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid

      Just to get things off my chest I must say this with utmost sincerity........i HATE clay aiken. That gay poser is the number hit amongst internet search. I'd probably respect his corny ass if he was out and was like some gay spokesperson or something but all he is , is a stark reminder of the racism  in this country. By some freak accident Rueben Studdard was voted American Idol but this racist, right wing, hitler-esque country is not ready to have a black man as an american idol. We've already had several....malcolm x ...martin luther king...paul robeson...to name a few and what happened to them. They were either victims of U.S. one bullet politcs or vilified to the point of dying as hermits. No, that can't happen, so Rueben can only get any real play on BET not MTV. We've got to prove that America got it wrong. That even though rueben was voted , he can't be america's real idol! I mean come on! ...........moving on  I just finished watching my new favorite movie..Y tu mama tambien....If you haven't seen it do. And if your in the mood also see All About my mother and Talk to me. You spanish speaking people you! Oh and I saw Frida today. Thank my colombian sistah Tatiana for furnishing me with such an awesome world perspective. As far as artistic direction it was on some other level, visually stunning and the characters.....well all I have to say is VIVA CHARLATOS!! i won't talk any more just rent it.  If you haven't already  noticed I've been a tad bit depressed lately.........just a tad. Between a ton of family issues (if you don't know the details then it's probably not your business), school and etc....I haven't been myself at all but what was really missing was my coping mechanism which was muay thai. I started doing muay thai late last december and I had gotten really into it. For those that don't know muay thai is a martial art from thailand. It's different from American kickboxing in that it's more fluid, and you use knees and elbows and alotmore clenching. It's pretty brutal.........but very very physical. When I stopped slamming I had found this and it was "my own personal fightclub." It's true, you do'nt know yourself if you've never been in a fight. I realized I didn't. I was also training 5 times a week and getting into better shape then I had been in a long time then I get a toe injury which totally fucks me up. Sounds small but spraining your big toe offsets your whole body. You're not in alignment, allyour weight is on it....they told me if i fought I'd break it and i didn't want that. Well 4 weeks turned into 6 turned into 9 and before I knew it I hadn't trained in 6months and gained tons of weight. Plus I had broken up with the guy I was seeing, so no work out, no sex add some stress mix in some family issues, add a dash of convuluted hormones equaling out to no endorphins and you've got a recipe for one sad anxious girl....  well today was my first workout of 2004. Gary had given me his membership for December while he was away so I used it and those instructors worked me! I was in soo much pain but oh well no pain no gain. After a week and a half off I tried again in the total beginner's class. I'm not a total beginner but I'm in total beginner shape so..... so it was good, great actually. That followed by a Yoga class and suddenly the world wasn't so complicated, it might never have been but for me it was clouded. I'm not even in any pain... just alot a lighter....My goal.....to jump rope two minutes and do 30 pushups by the end of February. THis lard ass needs to shape up....well it's late Community Word Internship tomorrow.... and tomorrows lesson? learning to say no  nite

      For y'all that don't know i just moved back into the city. I'm living in the lower east sides so I'll be frequenting more poetry bars. I have 3 roomates, I've met one, she seems cool she's from raleigh N.C. She's souther so at least tries to act friendly. The other is a down south girl (black as opposed to the other one) She just moved back in from the january break about  4 hours ago. She doesn't seem so nice ,she's got a white boyfriend and seems insecure if there's another black woman in the presence. She can' t be the special token one anymore.....ok maybe i'm being judgemental.so??  film at 11

      Ok, let's try this again. I had started this blog entry by showing off about my sexy new pc. Oh you haven't heard? the one with the 2.6 gig cpu WITH hyperthreading, 2 gigs of ram, dual dvd burner (i've got TWO of em!), a 19 inch screen and wireless mouse and keyboard which means that i can now post from the comfort of my bed. I can write down my dreams before i forget them, without worrying about my boss looking over my shoulder at my posts. No this does not mean i'm rich, this means i've been saving for this computer since summer and it came in time cuz my other ancient machine died acouple weeks ago. It's amazing how disconnected I've felt the past couple of months, not just cuz of my computer but tons of other things. First off moving back to long island was a harrowing experience. I moved out of my parents house at 18 and though it's not abnormal to be living at home at 22 and still in college it was a MAJOR step back for me. I had my reasons (other then financial). My parents are getting a divorced( don't tell me you feel sorry, they need to be apart) but my little brother and my dad needed me so here i want. This left me commuting from long island and let me tell you , when you are faced with a 1 to 2 hour commute home, alone, drunk and to your parents , you're really not up for going out, plus i couldn't just spontaneously hang out with people, it had to be planned and that always meant expectations and well disappointment, so my ass just went to the library and home and well ........i felt just a little lonely .  Long story short this was a tough semester, I lost my wallet (twice), was so damned broke i hurt, was busy, run down, and lonely, but this is a new year. I've got not one but two steady jobs, the guys at rikers are the bomb, i'm living in the city, and i'm about to graduate. So this is my new years post, a reflection on my past and a plan for my future  First things first........ 1. I'm a kid, kid like, kiddish and curious    it can be trying and interesting and it's me for where i am now    thanks matt (so i saw my name mentioned a couple more times in your blog) for listening    through all the alchohol, Gary for your patience and love, Papi for being my rock, bassey for all those late    nite AIM sessions, Fish for keeping it real and last but not least Oscar for forgiveness.........I've missed you.  2. I'll spend alot more time editing all the shit i wrote last year and finally put out a chap book or self publish  3. Work out. I've done al ot of internal work, so now my external is going to get some work. I want to get back to the weight that i was at this time last year. ( I won't say what that was but trust me it's alot thinner) I'll be back boxing now that my toe is healed. ( i still feel pain but i'll work around it.) It's going to be harder then when i first started cuz i'm alot heavier but that factors into my 2005 goals which is to compete....next  4. Have publishable research by MAY. It'll get done. period  5. Love all the people i've been loving but haven't had the time too  6. drink more.   there's more but they are more private. I'm going to start keeping a private journal cuz there's just some stuff that's straight none of your damned business. It'll be hard but i'll try to keep it separate....  ok NEXT!! top ten things I loved about 2003  10. Realizing that Christina Aguilera can actually sing! (she's dumb as a post but she really can sing) 9. Community Word 8. G-boy 7. blogs! BLOGS! BLOGS! 6. Discovering the magic of digital movie making 5. eating Indian Food for the first time ( thanks peter!) 4. The Matrix Reloaded 3. The Matrix Revolutions 2. Return of the King 1. Realizing how racist return of the king while at the same time getting closer to my dad and my little brother again. It was a good year.....a really good year  Mood: relaxed, tired, excited Listening to: Korn, Freak on a Leash  good nite , good people

      I've been writing alot lately, thanks to hanging out with  urlLink matt  so much. Hanging out with other poets is healthy and you can be poetically nerdy together. I started re-reading neon vernacular by Yusef Komunyaka. I had to read it for a class and honestly, I didn't like him much. His jazz poems were much too esoteric for my taste ( and most still are ) and there was something supremely elitist about it. Maybe it doesn't make sense but that was my primary emotional response to his work.......now I'm reading him again and I'm getting inspired. As far as my process goes, when I get  blocked I like to read other poets and respond to them.   Here it is.....new poem...post comments :)   The mercy of light/ a monday nite at 13/incident II   the candles only bring doubt to him what is he missing on this first date? which flaws go by unnoticed?  she understands  what the absence of light adds how candlelight  includes the rosiness of checks the smooth part of skin shines over ashy patches makes stomach rolls under black satin smooth as the light distracts him from the plane of  one dimensional physicality  the decision to cash in the second drink chip sits on a foundation built on an  increasingly wobbly stack of   "so whats"  reeking of cigarrette smoke   enveloped in the security of a dark bar with red lights in the bathroom no one knows flaw each a hazy glowing version of themselves they welcome one night affairs with intentions as punch-drunk as they are  who knows what happens tuesday morning? who cares?  the mercy of light favors the unfavorable candles  wash away the lines that begin to show in cracked smiles it convinces you that each  gasp each sigh explosion of buffooning laughter each accidental encounter is  more then incident  I was supposed to be at the  urlLink nuyorican  but damn it's cold. I called  urlLink rich  to see how bad the line was .......If i don't see you  urlLink rich  good luck!

      I walked into Forbidden Planet the other day. I haven't been there since freshman year in h.s. when I would take the train into the city to write poetry. I would write odes to F train, washington square park, union square. I thought I was soooo dope. Anyway now that I'm back living in the (Technically) Lower East Side i pass by Forbidden Planet all the time. For those that don't know it's a comic book store. I was browsing through some h.s. memories, the role playing games (yes i DID play a short stint of VAMPIRE but shhhh) but I ran across my new favorite comic......AQUAMAN! he is soooooo dope! I don't know what it is about him but I'm about to go pick up the next issue oh and Catwoman. She's stepped into the 20th century and she's a lesbian. I mean it makes sense.....being a lesbian save for that one special man who can wear rubber and a cape and still make it look sexy?

       Today is the the second to last Rikers class for this session. Although I'm sad "I'm glad it's coming to an end....it has been an amazing in experience,not in that corny look at me I'm a teacher  urlLink taylor mali  way (ok maybe a little) but in a selfish this-makes-me-feel-whole kind of way. I've had this huge gaping whole in my soul for so long........and I'm so tired of it. It didn't get filled up but somehow I found a way to forget about it.....I don't know what happened to it but I felt it fill up the first time I got in front of a classroom with 28(??) expectant faces who wanted me to prove them wrong , that maybe i had something to say, something to offer that would at least show them the way to salvation.   urlLink  "Don't bring a knife to a gun fight and don't bring a two step to the copa"   Don't go into Rikers to teach feeling afraid of your students because they can never be students to you then and thus you can never be a teacher One basic principle that people (teachers/parent's) is expect the worst of your kids and they will deliver. It's so simple a concept but still i get suspicious raised eyebrows...from my mother. "What are you doing there? You better not be getting a boyfriend" Forgive her, she's a haitian archie bunker with the tact of vertically challenged italian mafioso ...from queens. It's not pretty. At least she got over thinking I was  urlLink bisexual  I'm supposed to be reading for them today along with fish, claudia and keito....it'll be interesting I've got to finish a teaching path for community word today but that's not happening tonight....  Nuyorican tonight anyone? Hit me off on my tag board

      I just ordered a coffee........sugar no cream......a poet would see the irony in it all. If you want the full coverage check out  urlLink  mc's blog   for the story. I don't particularly feel like revisiting it. After much yelling I went to sleep fine but still I woke up pretty.....de centered. It's almost 11am and I still can't get any work done. This shit happens every day, mostly because  of my ideas and the intersection of those ideas with my being a black woman. It's ok, its' the world I live in and the price I pay for being who I am but last night, well last night was different. Last night it wasn't about my ideas or my politics and one might even argue that it wasn't about me at all. For that moment I was in an all white bar in the middle of fredonia new york and I all I was was a thing, the personification of all things dark, of all the rage you harbored hearing the OJ verdict, of all the images of project queens and of course the aftermath staring back. Being there was threatning, not to me but to them. Never once acknowledging that me or MC was there, comic after comic went up and made fun of  two drunk (white) nyu girls in the corner with their boyfriend but me and mc were invisible. He was by association and the dynamic proved far to complex for their feeble minds to comprehend butmost knew not to even go there. Armed with their own commitment to political correctness they did what most white people in that situation do and ignored me. But there's always that one white person who feels that his space is being trampled on and that he was the right to say racist jokes in front of black people. An idea that is insipid, natural and instinctive because had i not been there it would have gone by unnoticed and had i not walked out it was have gone on unapologized for. So I'm here, posting, not because i want to but because i need to. This is my only defense. It's not perfect, the version I had on my way to work this morning was alarminglymore witty and insightful...right now i'm trying to remember those words, remember my feelings.   That wasn't the first time I heard that joke and it certainly won't be the last , I felt strength for being able to get up and walk out but I felt stupid as well. Like a catholic rape victim my instinct was to blame myself for being in that situation. As anger rose in me so did guilt. What was a I doing there with a white boy nonetheless and the ghosts of  insipid "I told you so's" chased me out of that basement.    this is your turf m.c.  I joked as we decided to go in   protect me   He thought I was joking I'm sure.  He asked me before why I went to 13. This love hate relationship was confusing and I forgot what my answer was. What I mean is that i forgot what makes me go there every monday night, why I deal with the drama, why it always feels like home, like the fucked up incestuous family that it is and then I remembered fredonia state university Spring 2001. I remember being so thoroughly tired of being in situations like this, I remembered thinking   well this kind of racism will happen my whole life but I don't want to be schooling my white friends in how to act in these situations. Frankly i'm sick of having them period. At least in new york there's black people.   Then I met roger and then I went to 13 and then I found a place where everyone knows my name (and my drinks). It was a bout two blocks away from my school (which is all white) and had more black artists then any other place i had been too. It was safe. Every time we storm resevoirs on monday nites, i feel safe armed by knowing that there are things i need not explain. A place where I'm free to explore idiosyncrasies in myself  and not focus on how white peopleview me. A place where I'm not watched, dissected, or feared.  So now i go back to my page, the blank page and this is my defense. Sure I could have let m.c. beat up the guy but that wouldn't have made me feel any better and it wouldn't have changed anything. I'm not going to let his paradigm be mine and I won't let his racism buy out my own humanity.  I won't let him sour me with seeds of hate because I become no more then him. in the words of shappy    What's wrong with regular coffee? is it too strong for you? too black? too strong? too black    there's another open mike at that same bar next week. That auction block....err stage will still be there   And here are the comedy stylings of ms. diane wah!  thank you, thank you... wow folks thanks for having me back thank you, thank you  I like it here it feels so familiar See i'm not a comic i'm a poet poets and comics aren't so different they can't afford therapy so they spill their guts out in front of an audience hoping that their  patheticness will turn someone on enough to go home with it difference is  we can do it and rhyme   nervous giggles   thing is though, you all are special of all the comics I've seen  in new york you really are the worst. I can track all your jokes back to  the wednesday night line up on comedy central!    uprorious laughter     looking over at the red light signaling that time  is up  are you flashing that red light already? nah man I'm gonna go an extra 5 minutes reparations you know?   nervous forced laughter    Last week you couldn't think of something funny to say about a white guy and a black girl sitting in your comedy club drinking $2 rolling rock specials   well it's better to be silent and have people think you're stupid then to open your mouth and confirm their suspicions     ba dum dum that was my punchline!  I could go on...but i guess it's just not that funny now is it?   urlLink   "Five minutes before I free myself from my position. I am naked but not vulnerable. I am stared at, but not violated. I am the object of curiosity but not objectified. I am this not because of them but because of me. This affirmation; this validation exists only in the confines of my mind and that is the only place that it counts. There aren't many things that are certain but one is that I will die in an oppressive institution, but it doesn't mean that I can't live free."

      I was profoundly disappointed that I was the only one in our circle of blogs to mention MLK's birthday. Sincerely, this is the only American Holiday I even celebrate.  My mom was gone this December so we didn't celebrate christmas. Instead we give each other random gifts through out the year. It used to be just an excuse for the folks to give the kids shit they needed with their bonuses but especially as we got older and christmas would be rescheduled to the 2nd week of January (when everything went on sale) after a while the point became moot. This year my family OFFICIALLY decided to take thanksgiving off our list. Just an excuse to eat silly we realized that we were celebrating the slaughtering of the indians (DUH!) and wiped it off of our lists. Other then birthdays we don't celebrate holidays, just the lives we lead and we try and love each other hard  (we need it now) and every day......THe only holiday my fam (me , dad and George) celebrate is MLK day. USually it's spent lazing around the house with WBAI on. This is the only radio station that plays his speeches all day and in context. We read, reflect and discuss......This year i couldn't because i was in the office and the radio was shut off for more productivity.....I was upset but i chilled out....besides....its' like the twilight zone marathon every new year (yeah we still celebrate that)...after a while you see all the episodes...   The slam last nite.....Last night was the first time I've slammed since the survivor slam (which i still contest i deserve points for!)...... I tried a new piece (fight like a girl). Arguably the most childish piece i've ever written but i wanted points and thought it would slam well. I'll never learn not to slam poems i don't like but i did anyway and I was nervous as hell. That wasn't the only reason I was nervous.......My girls Tam, Lissette, and Soph were in the audience. We've known each other since Junior High/H.S. and they'd never seen me perform. I keep my circles so apart...Tam gets to hear all my poems at 3 am un edited and me crying but soph and lissette were so floored. Hopefully Rich, they'll come back :) Anyway the real reason I was nervous was cuz love walked in. I left a  garbled message the night before, half hoping he would ignore it about me wanting to slam...I got two hang ups and a fone call around 5:30  "You slammin tonight?" "......yeah" "You needed support" ".....choke.....sorta?" "I'll be there, don't worry" "really?" "of course really"    My heart dropped about a thousand feet. He always watched me slam, told me I was the best poet he ever heard, at least best for him. I never lost when he was there. In me i'd see glimpses of the woman I would become and I would be that for 3minutes and 10 seconds. It was no coincidence that the year I made finals, we were together and that when i stopped it was cuz we were apart.....  My first round could only be described as well.....insincere....it was an insincere poem delivered insincerely....though even at my best I don't think I'd ever beat Celena in a Slam (she's so dope) I could have done alot better....I deserved the scores I got. I thought I could fool the audience but you can't lie to them. I was shaking like a leaf.....and then? loved walked right in.....  "Hey D"  It's amazing....all the really close people in my life have called me that from they day they met me...i never really noticed I made a last minute switch and did when. I tried not looking at George..........i was enamored elsewhere. It's funny how you can fudge the facts of a poem (and believe me the facts are fudged in that one) but it's my most honest piece and i got to deliver it to the one I'll always love. I still got a time penalty (Fish almost clocked me and Roger gave me amuch deserved stern speech) but i didn't care. My nerves were settled and my heart and its jaw dropped open....What was he doing here? on a monday night in the freezing cold, just to tell me that he loved me without telling me that he loved me....  and then loved walked out as silently as he came in......

        I didn't really appreciate how far ahead of his time that Martin Luther King was until I heard this speech. It asks more from us not just on a political level but on a personal level. I  usually spend MLK day at home,listening to WBAI...it's peaceful and productive. It's the butt crack of dawn and I'm on my way to Community Word to finish up some work instead. I hope all is well and that everyone is safe. If there's a slam tonight I'll be there.     Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence  By Rev. Martin Luther King  4 April 1967 Speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1967, at a meeting of Clergy and Laity Concerned at Riverside Church in New York City    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice. I join with you in this meeting because I am in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organization which has brought us together: Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam. The recent statement of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart and I found myself in full accord when I read its opening lines: "A time comes when silence is betrayal." That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.   The truth of these words is beyond doubt but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world. Moreover when the issues at hand seem as perplexed as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty; but we must move on.   Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak. We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak. And we must rejoice as well, for surely this is the first time in our nation's history that a significant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading of history. Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us. If it is, let us trace its movement well and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its guidance, for we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us.   Over the past two years, as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart, as I have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam, many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path. At the heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud: Why are you speaking about war, Dr. King? Why are you joining the voices of dissent? Peace and civil rights don't mix, they say. Aren't you hurting the cause of your people, they ask? And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling. Indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live.   In the light of such tragic misunderstandings, I deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly, and I trust concisely, why I believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church -- the church in Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate -- leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight.   I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation. This speech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the National Liberation Front. It is not addressed to China or to Russia.   Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam. Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they can play in a successful resolution of the problem. While they both may have justifiable reason to be suspicious of the good faith of the United States, life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on both sides.   Tonight, however, I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the NLF, but rather to my fellow Americans, who, with me, bear the greatest responsibility in ending a conflict that has exacted a heavy price on both continents.   The Importance of Vietnam  Since I am a preacher by trade, I suppose it is not surprising that I have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the field of my moral vision. There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor -- both black and white -- through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such.   Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home. It was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinarily high proportions relative to the rest of the population. We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem. So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools. So we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the huts of a poor village, but we realize that they would never live on the same block in Detroit. I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor.   My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it grows out of my experience in the ghettoes of the North over the last three years -- especially the last three summers. As I have walked among the desperate, rejected and angry young men I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they asked -- and rightly so -- what about Vietnam? They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today -- my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.   For those who ask the question, "Aren't you a civil rights leader?" and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have this further answer. In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: "To save the soul of America." We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself unless the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear. In a way we were agreeing with Langston Hughes, that black bard of Harlem, who had written earlier:    O, yes, I say it plain, America never was America to me, And yet I swear this oath-- America will be!  Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read Vietnam. It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land.   As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of America were not enough, another burden of responsibility was placed upon me in 1964; and I cannot forget that the Nobel Prize for Peace was also a commission -- a commission to work harder than I had ever worked before for "the brotherhood of man." This is a calling that takes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were not present I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the ministry of Jesus Christ. To me the relationship of this ministry to the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those who ask me why I am speaking against the war. Could it be that they do not know that the good news was meant for all men -- for Communist and capitalist, for their children and ours, for black and for white, for revolutionary and conservative? Have they forgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the one who loved his enemies so fully that he died for them? What then can I say to the "Vietcong" or to Castro or to Mao as a faithful minister of this one? Can I threaten them with death or must I not share with them my life?   Finally, as I try to delineate for you and for myself the road that leads from Montgomery to this place I would have offered all that was most valid if I simply said that I must be true to my conviction that I share with all men the calling to be a son of the living God. Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood, and because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them.   This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation's self-defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for victims of our nation and for those it calls enemy, for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.   Strange Liberators  And as I ponder the madness of Vietnam and search within myself for ways to understand and respond to compassion my mind goes constantly to the people of that peninsula. I speak now not of the soldiers of each side, not of the junta in Saigon, but simply of the people who have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous decades now. I think of them too because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries.   They must see Americans as strange liberators. The Vietnamese people proclaimed their own independence in 1945 after a combined French and Japanese occupation, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. Even though they quoted the American Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom, we refused to recognize them. Instead, we decided to support France in its reconquest of her former colony.   Our government felt then that the Vietnamese people were not "ready" for independence, and we again fell victim to the deadly Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long. With that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government seeking self-determination, and a government that had been established not by China (for whom the Vietnamese have no great love) but by clearly indigenous forces that included some Communists. For the peasants this new government meant real land reform, one of the most important needs in their lives.   For nine years following 1945 we denied the people of Vietnam the right of independence. For nine years we vigorously supported the French in their abortive effort to recolonize Vietnam.   Before the end of the war we were meeting eighty percent of the French war costs. Even before the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu, they began to despair of the reckless action, but we did not. We encouraged them with our huge financial and military supplies to continue the war even after they had lost the will. Soon we would be paying almost the full costs of this tragic attempt at recolonization.   After the French were defeated it looked as if independence and land reform would come again through the Geneva agreements. But instead there came the United States, determined that Ho should not unify the temporarily divided nation, and the peasants watched again as we supported one of the most vicious modern dictators -- our chosen man, Premier Diem. The peasants watched and cringed as Diem ruthlessly routed out all opposition, supported their extortionist landlords and refused even to discuss reunification with the north. The peasants watched as all this was presided over by U.S. influence and then by increasing numbers of U.S. troops who came to help quell the insurgency that Diem's methods had aroused. When Diem was overthrown they may have been happy, but the long line of military dictatorships seemed to offer no real change -- especially in terms of their need for land and peace.   The only change came from America as we increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept and without popular support. All the while the people read our leaflets and received regular promises of peace and democracy -- and land reform. Now they languish under our bombs and consider us -- not their fellow Vietnamese --the real enemy. They move sadly and apathetically as we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps where minimal social needs are rarely met. They know they must move or be destroyed by our bombs. So they go -- primarily women and children and the aged.   They watch as we poison their water, as we kill a million acres of their crops. They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas preparing to destroy the precious trees. They wander into the hospitals, with at least twenty casualties from American firepower for one "Vietcong"-inflicted injury. So far we may have killed a million of them -- mostly children. They wander into the towns and see thousands of the children, homeless, without clothes, running in packs on the streets like animals. They see the children, degraded by our soldiers as they beg for food. They see the children selling their sisters to our soldiers, soliciting for their mothers.   What do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords and as we refuse to put any action into our many words concerning land reform? What do they think as we test our latest weapons on them, just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europe? Where are the roots of the independent Vietnam we claim to be building? Is it among these voiceless ones?   We have destroyed their two most cherished institutions: the family and the village. We have destroyed their land and their crops. We have cooperated in the crushing of the nation's only non-Communist revolutionary political force -- the unified Buddhist church. We have supported the enemies of the peasants of Saigon. We have corrupted their women and children and killed their men. What liberators?   Now there is little left to build on -- save bitterness. Soon the only solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call fortified hamlets. The peasants may well wonder if we plan to build our new Vietnam on such grounds as these? Could we blame them for such thoughts? We must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise. These too are our brothers.   Perhaps the more difficult but no less necessary task is to speak for those who have been designated as our enemies. What of the National Liberation Front -- that strangely anonymous group we call VC or Communists? What must they think of us in America when they realize that we permitted the repression and cruelty of Diem which helped to bring them into being as a resistance group in the south? What do they think of our condoning the violence which led to their own taking up of arms? How can they believe in our integrity when now we speak of "aggression from the north" as if there were nothing more essential to the war? How can they trust us when now we charge them with violence after the murderous reign of Diem and charge them with violence while we pour every new weapon of death into their land? Surely we must understand their feelings even if we do not condone their actions. Surely we must see that the men we supported pressed them to their violence. Surely we must see that our own computerized plans of destruction simply dwarf their greatest acts.   How do they judge us when our officials know that their membership is less than twenty-five percent Communist and yet insist on giving them the blanket name? What must they be thinking when they know that we are aware of their control of major sections of Vietnam and yet we appear ready to allow national elections in which this highly organized political parallel government will have no part? They ask how we can speak of free elections when the Saigon press is censored and controlled by the military junta. And they are surely right to wonder what kind of new government we plan to help form without them -- the only party in real touch with the peasants. They question our political goals and they deny the reality of a peace settlement from which they will be excluded. Their questions are frighteningly relevant. Is our nation planning to build on political myth again and then shore it up with the power of new violence?   Here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence when it helps us to see the enemy's point of view, to hear his questions, to know his assessment of ourselves. For from his view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition.   So, too, with Hanoi. In the north, where our bombs now pummel the land, and our mines endanger the waterways, we are met by a deep but understandable mistrust. To speak for them is to explain this lack of confidence in Western words, and especially their distrust of American intentions now. In Hanoi are the men who led the nation to independence against the Japanese and the French, the men who sought membership in the French commonwealth and were betrayed by the weakness of Paris and the willfulness of the colonial armies. It was they who led a second struggle against French domination at tremendous costs, and then were persuaded to give up the land they controlled between the thirteenth and seventeenth parallel as a temporary measure at Geneva. After 1954 they watched us conspire with Diem to prevent elections which would have surely brought Ho Chi Minh to power over a united Vietnam, and they realized they had been betrayed again.   When we ask why they do not leap to negotiate, these things must be remembered. Also it must be clear that the leaders of Hanoi considered the presence of American troops in support of the Diem regime to have been the initial military breach of the Geneva agreements concerning foreign troops, and they remind us that they did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had moved into the tens of thousands.   Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about the earlier North Vietnamese overtures for peace, how the president claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made. Ho Chi Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its forces, and now he has surely heard of the increasing international rumors of American plans for an invasion of the north. He knows the bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion strategy. Perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor weak nation more than eight thousand miles away from its shores.   At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless on Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our troops there as anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy and the secure while we create hell for the poor.   This Madness Must Cease  Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as an American to the leaders of my own nation. The great initiative in this war is ours. The initiative to stop it must be ours.   This is the message of the great Buddhist leaders of Vietnam. Recently one of them wrote these words:   "Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct. The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies. It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat. The image of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism."   If we continue, there will be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honorable intentions in Vietnam. It will become clear that our minimal expectation is to occupy it as an American colony and men will not refrain from thinking that our maximum hope is to goad China into a war so that we may bomb her nuclear installations. If we do not stop our war against the people of Vietnam immediately the world will be left with no other alternative than to see this as some horribly clumsy and deadly game we have decided to play.   The world now demands a maturity of America that we may not be able to achieve. It demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in Vietnam, that we have been detrimental to the life of the Vietnamese people. The situation is one in which we must be ready to turn sharply from our present ways.   In order to atone for our sins and errors in Vietnam, we should take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war. I would like to suggest five concrete things that our government should do immediately to begin the long and difficult process of extricating ourselves from this nightmarish conflict:    End all bombing in North and South Vietnam.  Declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hope that such action will create the atmosphere for negotiation.  Take immediate steps to prevent other battlegrounds in Southeast Asia by curtailing our military buildup in Thailand and our interference in Laos.  Realistically accept the fact that the National Liberation Front has substantial support in South Vietnam and must thereby play a role in any meaningful negotiations and in any future Vietnam government.  Set a date that we will remove all foreign troops from Vietnam in accordance with the 1954 Geneva agreement.   Part of our ongoing commitment might well express itself in an offer to grant asylum to any Vietnamese who fears for his life under a new regime which included the Liberation Front. Then we must make what reparations we can for the damage we have done. We most provide the medical aid that is badly needed, making it available in this country if necessary.   Protesting The War  Meanwhile we in the churches and synagogues have a continuing task while we urge our government to disengage itself from a disgraceful commitment. We must continue to raise our voices if our nation persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam. We must be prepared to match actions with words by seeking out every creative means of protest possible.   As we counsel young men concerning military service we must clarify for them our nation's role in Vietnam and challenge them with the alternative of conscientious objection. I am pleased to say that this is the path now being chosen by more than seventy students at my own alma mater, Morehouse College, and I recommend it to all who find the American course in Vietnam a dishonorable and unjust one. Moreover I would encourage all ministers of draft age to give up their ministerial exemptions and seek status as conscientious objectors. These are the times for real choices and not false ones. We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest.   There is something seductively tempting about stopping there and sending us all off on what in some circles has become a popular crusade against the war in Vietnam. I say we must enter the struggle, but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing. The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality we will find ourselves organizing clergy- and laymen-concerned committees for the next generation. They will be concerned about Guatemala and Peru. They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia. They will be concerned about Mozambique and South Africa. We will be marching for these and a dozen other names and attending rallies without end unless there is a significant and profound change in American life and policy. Such thoughts take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our calling as sons of the living God.   In 1957 a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution. During the past ten years we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which now has justified the presence of U.S. military "advisors" in Venezuela. This need to maintain social stability for our investments accounts for the counter-revolutionary action of American forces in Guatemala. It tells why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Colombia and why American napalm and green beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru. It is with such activity in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said, "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."   Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken -- the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investment.   I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a "thing-oriented" society to a "person-oriented" society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.   A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. n the one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life's roadside; but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: "This is not just." It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America and say: "This is not just." The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just. A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war: "This way of settling differences is not just." This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.   America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values. There is nothing, except a tragic death wish, to prevent us from reordering our priorities, so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war. There is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood.   This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism. War is not the answer. Communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons. Let us not join those who shout war and through their misguided passions urge the United States to relinquish its participation in the United Nations. These are days which demand wise restraint and calm reasonableness. We must not call everyone a Communist or an appeaser who advocates the seating of Red China in the United Nations and who recognizes that hate and hysteria are not the final answers to the problem of these turbulent days. We must not engage in a negative anti-communism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy, realizing that our greatest defense against communism is to take offensive action in behalf of justice. We must with positive action seek to remove thosse conditions of poverty, insecurity and injustice which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and develops.   The People Are Important  These are revolutionary times. All over the globe men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression and out of the wombs of a frail world new systems of justice and equality are being born. The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as never before. "The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light." We in the West must support these revolutions. It is a sad fact that, because of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of communism, and our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch anti-revolutionaries. This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has the revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism is a judgement against our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions we initiated. Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism. With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and unjust mores and thereby speed the day when "every valley shall be exalted, and every moutain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain."   A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.   This call for a world-wide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing and unconditional love for all men. This oft misunderstood and misinterpreted concept -- so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly force -- has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man. When I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-Moslem-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John:   Let us love one another; for love is God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. If we love one another God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.   Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day. We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate. As Arnold Toynbee says : "Love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil. Therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last word."   We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity. The "tide in the affairs of men" does not remain at the flood; it ebbs. We may cry out deperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residue of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words: "Too late." There is an invisible book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect. "The moving finger writes, and having writ moves on..." We still have a choice today; nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation.   We must move past indecision to action. We must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world -- a world that borders on our doors. If we do not act we shall surely be dragged down the long dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight.   Now let us begin. Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter -- but beautiful -- struggle for a new world. This is the callling of the sons of God, and our brothers wait eagerly for our response. Shall we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell them the struggle is too hard? Will our message be that the forces of American life militate against their arrival as full men, and we send our deepest regrets? Or will there be another message, of longing, of hope, of solidarity with their yearnings, of commitment to their cause, whatever the cost? The choice is ours, and though we might prefer it otherwise we must choose in this crucial moment of human history.   As that noble bard of yesterday, James Russell Lowell, eloquently stated:   Once to every man and nation Comes the moment to decide, In the strife of truth and falsehood, For the good or evil side; Some great cause, God's new Messiah, Off'ring each the bloom or blight, And the choice goes by forever Twixt that darkness and that light.   Though the cause of evil prosper, Yet 'tis truth alone is strong; Though her portion be the scaffold, And upon the throne be wrong: Yet that scaffold sways the future, And behind the dim unknown, Standeth God within the shadow Keeping watch above his own.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Messages on BRC-NEWS may be forwarded and cross-posted, as long as proper attribution is given to the author and originating publication (including the email address and any copyright notices), and the wording is not altered in any way, other than for formatting.

      Two posts today and one last night? Wow I really have no life. I woke up this morning feeling like two midgets kicked me in my shins and now I just can't find the midgets.................fucking midgets.' My roomates are struggling to understand me. I seem normal most times except for the writing binges I go on where I come out of my room looking like a bear with a bad perm. So you see  i updated. I'm sure I'll get comments from the peanut gallery disappointed with my descriptions of them in my list of blogs so bring it on you ego maniacs!    Thinking about:  Graduation,Rikers Research, Teaching, How I'm gonna support myself after                graduating   Listening to: Jason Mraz and Norah Jones   Loving:  The view from my window   Guilty Pleasure:  Hanging out with m.c. siegel and listening to Tracy Ullman's greatest hits album   How to Charm me:  Be completely honest with me and then feed me and give me a hug    How to Annoy me:  Be  too ego-maniacal to see through your own bullshit, hang on the thread of others validating who you are and THEN post it on your blog and think it's the greatest fucking thing ever.  peace, poetry and progress

      Ok, so as I'm trying to update this site, I realize that I go to OTHER people's blogs to get links to other folks blogs,namely m.c. and guy's pages so I was like DUH diane, you should put those links on your page. Well, so now it's a mishmosh of journals I like to read, journals I want to read more often and just random name dropping like for example when was the last time BONAFIDE updated HIS blog y'all? can we keep it real? just for a moment? But that's ok, it's an online community and we like to name our friends and it's at least a little more productive then friendster.   Moving on  I'm adding a list of random places I go to on line so for that I went to bassey's site and there was a link to  urlLink arrested development! WHAT IS UP WITH THE TOKEN WHITE GIRL WITH THE FLOWERS!!  A FUCKING FLOWER?!?!? how stereoptypical is that?!  The random white girl who just can't get enough of..... so anyway  guess what? even better? they have a "spirtual advisor"...that's code for full time weed man anyway check it out.....  I was also reading  urlLink Guy's blog  and I was one of the folks who wanted to know what the hell he was doing post louder arts. I kept thinking he'd start another series, perhaps at Urbana, something more political perhaps but then I realized that he's grown up or more accurately grown beyond this scene. I'm not there yet but I understand where he's coming from. I'll be for real. It's cool now to have a place where everyone knows my name, have a home where I feel socially accepted, have one to 5 places where I can go alone and still run into mad people i know. it's nice, it's comforting, it's in liue of the student center in college.Now in hindsight I realize how kind of naive that question was on so many levels almost insinuating that louderarts is the center and there is no life outside of it. It's very easy for that too happen. I see it all the time. New people come in and are wowed by the cliquish-ness of this and they want to belong soooooooooo bad and it's sad, not because people want to belong  but because of how the incestuousness of bar 13 feeds  on that so much. It doesn't (and from what I know never has ) taken much to get into the collective (i dont' even like using that word cuz it's such bull shit) other then specifically taking louderarts workshops and sucking up (or on) the right people.I've now seperated my louder arts memories into during guy, guy in virginia and post guy. (Don't get it twisted ;) Why? Because the major difference in the scene was the philosophy behind it and when guy left there was no philosophy, just a bad episode of 21 jumpstreet where all the characters really WERE too old to pretend to be highschoolers. Though this rant borders on nostalgic, these are the things I remember. I remember Marty telling me a poem that I thought was revolutionary was actually horribly cliche and that helping me, I remember the first slam I'd been too where everyone was sooo different from each other and so new! and I remember being in a place that encouraged me to be myself, and above all it had a philosophy that I wanted to believe in and that idea was that POETRY CAN INSPIRE CHANGE.  idealistic? not so much. we thought we were modern day soothsayers and underground newsanchors. It was our responsibility transform the complications outside into a format understandable by our breathren. That's why you had your alix olsons, and steph colemans, and staceyann chins and yolanda wilkinsons that did so well. That's why the nuyo used to be so hot and now its' just a cliche of a cliche  now the philosophy that's won out is that   POETRY CAN GET YOU LAID  and it can.......oh and it does.   Sometimes I'm still the 8 yr old girl no one wanted to play tag with. Often I'm the 15 year old who got suspended for not standing up for the pledge, on select days I'm the 19  year old who can't understand why white people in authority don't like her and today i stand 22 and trying so hard not to be disillusioned, trying so hard to rise above the disappointment and to accept the people around me for who they are ...they are not my saviors, my parents but sometimes, sometimes they are my friends and on odd days my extended family.  I fear for them sometimes like I fear for all I love     Anyway, one of the main reasons I even came her was because of Roger. His trini swagger and passion won me over (as it does alot of impressionable young girls) however what made me stay was Guy. In fact what makes me want to go (even though I've been too broke to make it the past couple of weeks) Acentos is Guy. Why? Because I too have not lost faith in the power of poetry but I have lost alot of faith in the people in this scene. I'm only 22 but I've been here way too long and as I've stated before it's this torrid love affair where you are always worried that you will take the baby out with the bathwater.

      I just got home from the Urbana slam. It's pretty fucked up that I feel (felt) more at home at a place with a  urlLink bipolar, ex?coke addict  that fired me unjustly then I do any where else. I've been slamming this week . Last monday at Bar 13, this wednesday at the nuyo (quite frankly the worst poetry I'd ever heard other then John S. Hall and this guy that used his foreskin for parchment?) Anyway I did ok and when I mean ok, I mean I did well enough in my performance to not feel bad. I've had a bad case of  urlLink nerves  lately. Actually more like panic attacks with shaking cold and hands and the stench of groping eyes on my back.  It's not easy  being cheesy so get off mah back fo' sheezy  I have this theory, that if you've been in the slam scene long enough without making a team, you just stop giving a shit, or maybe worse yet you do. I'm caught in the contradiction of both these feelings but it's not about the slam (really). It's more about being able to go up on stage and pour my heart out and be honest in a place other then the  context of a 10x10 room on the lower east side. I felt like i did that tonight and i was relaxed (and sober.......mostly) and most important I wanted to share and even better I had people that wanted to listen. I did one new poem. The others were mercilessly trapped on a computer disk without a kinko's in sight. ( I found out later that there was on on astor place but that would have been way too far to walk)  urlLink Taylor  and  urlLink ed  gave me some good advice on my pacing. The shit was just too long and not in the corny  urlLink time penalty  way but more in the pacing and over padding of the work. a year ago that wouldn't have been a problem but there are tons of lines i've grown out of and my shit (that has clocked in 2:59 second) was well into 4 minutes  Anyway, being able to perform without the crutch that is  him  was definately freeing...... and I'm excited about putting out new work , because i'm just as sick of my shit as you may be... till next time   "I wonder in the what if's of tesseracts  so bend my back  like the time space continum"    p.s. OH! and matt, that panty dropper poem you did? WHATEVER...This woman bought me a drink and she wasn't a lesbian but she would have been with ME. YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AND WHAT!@?!?!

      Ok, thanks to  urlLink guy  and  urlLink m.c.   for starting this but I've realize that I've been no where. I'm such a new yorker. I  never fucking leave new york, probably because there isn't much out there. New Years resolution 2004 is to LEAVE  and go on tour. New Yorkers are so closeted here, it's ridiculous.  Funny Story.  When i first moved to Valley Stream, Long Island (which is literally 3 blocks from queens) My friends would take the bus to the border refusing to actually leave queens and god forbid those manhattan friends that went to stuyvesant highschool. They NEVER fucking left manhattan until Williamsburg became the NEW downtown. WHAT THE FUCK! we are so geographically incestuous that instead of actually leaving new york, we just create new and trendy neighborhoods to go to , oh wait THAT's just plain ole gentrification but wait, how many times has the downtown scene been reinvented?   comments? deathreats?        urlLink create your own visited states map   or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide

      Tesseract  On the third dimension plane The shortest distance between Point B and point A Is a straight line And time Only moves in one direction But I have a tendency to meander   Forgive me For loving you  In the future tense When the smart girl in freshman English class Caught up to the woman I want to am Who knows how to love hard And listen soft Who knew  how to understand the man you were And love the man you are  I love to love you slow And to live fast  I like to love you multi versed Polyphonically If my love  Were a building It would be a panopticon I would love you from all 8 walls The ceiling and the floor Love you so consistently That when I was gone You would love yourself out of habit   3rd dimension beings loving on a 4th dimension planet  I visit the 5th nightly to see you  If I could I would build a laser So strong That its light would travel  infinitely around your curves Continue around the earth And come back to you Id put a thousand mirrors In its path So that You can see yourself The way I see you Front and back   Feel the pulse of a heartbeat Other than mine Dissect spider webs Until theyre string To learn humanity Through laughing at myself Instead of you Because The arrhythmia you cause Just isnt funny  Stretch your back out my canvas Trace the line Between love and fascination Find the atlas of your fingerprint Finger your life map  Wonder in the what ifs Of tesseracts Bend my back  Like the time space continuum  So that a trip to the moon  Would only  Cost  $1.50 And space was just a detail And time  Made the comma The semi-colon The period useless  In this dimension there would be no time nor distance to make the heart grow fonder only you

        Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. Your afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.

      I decided to start reading some other blogs. In reality I don't read to many. Mostly, Guy's, m.c. Siegels, Fish and rich's and bassey's. They get the most updates , but I've been looking to expand. Sometimes I read  urlLink RAC's  (I like her) I guess great minds think alike. OH! and Ed garcia's. Here's an excerpt.     My grandmother just got knee surgery in El Salvador. Laser knee surgery. They made two small incisions on the sides of her knee, burned away the cartilage that had been eroded by arthritis and replaced it with injections of new cartilage to act as a cushion. Those injections of chicken cartilage were manufactured in nearby New Jersey. The doctor even showed my grandmother the box and the price on the side. After the surgery the doctor pulls out a cd from his laptop and hands it to my mother. He says here is the operation on DVD. All of this sounds expensive doesn't it. An operation like that here would cost tens of thousands of dollars. Why the shots from jersey alone would probably cost a grand each, if not more. Yet my grandmother only paid two thousand dollars for the entire operation, the injections ended up being $160 dollars a piece and the DVD was thrown in for free. Where are you gonna get that done in the first world. How are you gonna pay for your knees without giving up an arm or a leg? Wouldn't it be nice if every old lady that hobbled on the cold New York sidewalks could get their lives of mobility and freedom back for so little a cost. Aren't we the greatest nation on earth.   urlLink -Ed   sounds like a poem.... This is my challenge.  Everyone who reads this write a poem One from the  perspective of Ed One from the perspective of the Doctor One from the perspectie of Ed's grandmother  I did this exercise with some of the Rikers' guys. It was intended to help them step outside of themselves and their imaginations through the writing of persona poems. It also helped in committing to a voice and working on making that voice be real. Ok it MAY sound like i'm exploiting Ed's story, but I'm not. As  urlLink community word  would say, "Never miss a learning oppurtunity"

      1. Since I'm not into football, I am not distracted by the competition so because of this I can see the writing on the wall.       I knew the patriots were going to win the superbowl,  not because I was rooting for them but because there is a war going on in Iraq!     Come ON! Don't y'all remember 9/11? The patriots making it in on a wildcard? Please, if you GW can fix an election I don't think the Superbowl     is that big a deal. Think about it! The Patriots are relatively new franchise! What business do that have in the superbowl!So my stipulation is that when there is   a  need for pro-american sentitment , the Patriots will have a chance.Besides! they were playing the Panthers, as in the BLACK PANTHERS? there was NO WAY north  carolina was going to win. HELLO?!? My guess is that as long as Bush is in the White house the patriots have  chance. Coincidence? i think NOT!  2.  Miguel Algarin , one of the original Nuyoricans is a P.I.M.P      Yes he WAS hitting on me last time I was there and despite what you saw in the movie he is NOT GAY, he's every sexual. We had a very deep conversation     while he was molesting his main girl Tammy? ( I can't remember her name , just that she was about 35 years younger then he was). Much love, I cannot hate.      PLUS she was buying him food cuz he had no loot! Talk about GAME! I have to give props to any guy that age who can still put it on. He gets mucho love from me      cuz he keeps it real in the back of the bar  3. Julio IS SCARY    but he's my boy. I think i'm the only person in the world audacious enough to yell back at him and no he's not a pussy cat inside, that's why he can be the oldest    bouncer in nyc cuz he will straight mess you up with that gruff voice and cockeyed stare that makes you feel like your dad when your mom is screaming at you and all he has to do is stare at you and you wanna piss your jumpers   4. You can't always get what you want. live with it. It doesn't mean you're a failure, it's simply the way the world works.  5.Breakfast can be served at anytime  6. Why is Popeye's chicken named aftera  vegetarian? He ate spinach for power for chrissake! You see how Propaganda just turns shit on it's head?  7. Paulo Friere is truly revolutionary  8. I need to spelchek my blog more  9. If you missed the superbowl, here is a highlight of the rank debauchery that is modern colonialism fucking in historical context  urlLink peep show

      I wonder if this is becoming a habit...Okay, so Diane asked me to write for her again.  Could you consider this ghost writing since I'm actually saying who I am?  We do have similar names and all...   Anyway, la la la...Dont have much to say so I'll tell you a funny story that happened to me and Diane this morning.  She worked out this morning and while she was downstairs she was logged into another computer (or something like that).  So she forgot to log out, right? And she gets back to her room and she IMs me...  So she and I are typing back and forth and then all of a sudden she writes, "I dont know who you want to talk to, but I'm not her" and I'm like, "then  she writes something like, "I think you are trying to reach the RA, I'm an administrative assistant here, and I'm not her." and I'm like, "Diane, what the fuck, you have TRULY lost it now, gurl." and she's all like, "what?" so then I'm thinking, ok maybe Matt's over and is fucking with me on the computer so I'm like, "Okay, Diane, what kind of game are you playing?" and she's all like, 'What are YOU talking about?" as if I'M the nutjob (no comments, GUY!) So anyway, she really seems confused so I copy and paste what "she" wrote and lo and behold she DIDN'T write it.  She was logged in at two computers at the SAME TIME and neither one could see what the other was writing, just my responses.  Isnt that weird?  Diane claims its some new thing that AOL 9.0 has.  I HATE IT.  That means people, like this silly little admin. who didnt know how to log Diane off, can be talking to my friends while I'm not around!  What kinda shit is that, she thought to herself while typing...  Anyway, alls I'm saying is, that watch out where you log yourself in, because your friends may get very confused and call Bellevue on you because they think you have some dissociative disorder or something.    Thats it for me this afternoon. Stay tuned for your regularly scheduled Diane soon enough.

       The Diane Show is momentarily on hiatus, however Dyanna R. will be blogging for your reading pleasure. :)    Since Diane just doesn't feel like blogging today, but wants to keep up with her New Year's resolution of blogging more often, she asked me to fill in for her.  This is SO Kanke writing in Bassey's journal.  Thanks for the idea, guys! (by the way, Kanke is a trip! www.basseyworld.com)   So here I am, at work, reading blogs, IMing Diane and Betsey and Tamara and Melissa, as well as trying to find some last minute getaway for me and my hubby Steve to go on this weekend.  Yes, I know its the Wednesday before Valentine's Day, which also happens to be a holiday weekend.  AND?!  It seems that London is out of the question.  $1,400 round trip for the weekend.  Hmmm... how much is left on the card?  Oh darnit, not enough.  WAIT A SEC. WHAT AM I THINKING??   VALENTINE'S DAY SUCKS ASS.  It's a Hallmark created holiday, dammit.  It make people who aren't in a relationship feel bad that they have no one to call their own... It makes people who are in a relationship go crazy trying to figure out what to get their loved one (i.e. a trip to London for the weekend).   I had a boyfriend once who didn't believe in it (the fuck.)  That said, since then, I've gotten used to not making a big deal about the day.  Heck, I'm a semi-newlywed!  Every day is V-Day, right?  NOT!  Well, okay, we ARE sappy with each other every day, but that's not the point!!  Why do I want the chocolates that I shouldn't eat, the overpriced wilted roses that he doesn't need to spend money on, or the sappy cards that say what I already know every day, dammit!  Because it has become the GIMME GIMME holiday.   The endless barrage of "I LOVE YOU, BUY ME STUFF" advertising campaigns all over the place have finally gotten to me, I think.  I was perfectly content to have a nice candlelight dinner by the fireplace before Hallmark, Zales, Godiva et. al. decided to change my mind for me.  Fuckers!  And now it's too late!  What to do? What to doooo?   After searching for hotels and bed & breakfasts, I've come to the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with a dinner by the fire.  (Yeah, so everything was sold out, AND??)  It's a helluvalot cheaper.  hmmph.  Take THAT Zales.  Your diamonds suck anyway.  So...do you think I'll get the $99 diamond heart pendant this year?  hmmph.

      Points I need to make   1. John S. Hall is an embarrassment to poetry  2. Words beginning with the letter "q"  quinoa   \Qui*no"a\, n. The seeds of a kind of goosewort (Chenopodium Quinoa), used in Chili and Peru for making porridge or cakes; also, food thus made.   Source: Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary,  1996, 1998 MICRA, Inc.    3. I read my tesseract poem tonight at 13. It's one of the first times i've been on the open mic in a long ass while. My staff meeting for tomorrow got cancelled so i want to make it up to acentos. The tesseract poem comes from a series of old computer/physics themed poems. I want to take this, which helped me get through highschool and turn it into a poem. take a look and you'll understand what i was in high school.                                                             The Hacker Manifesto                                                                                             by                                                                        +++The Mentor+++                                                                      Written January 8, 1986   Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...  Damn kids. They're all alike.  But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?  I am a hacker, enter my world...  Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...  Damn underachiever. They're all alike.  I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..."  Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.  I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...  Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.  And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...  Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...  You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.   This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.  Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.  I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

      well goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood morning and welcome to the wonderful world of toys.....in babeland specifically. I think the world is a beautiful place...........yeah..........hmmm...........  My roomate just turned me on (no pun intended) to something that I think will change my life... ::drumroll:: the vibrating egg! YES!! never used one! it was great. Ok the story starts alot earlier then this.  After the wednesday nite slam i ended up in bed by say 7AM and i woke up at 10am needless to say i was tired. I figured i'd sleep at 6pm but alas i had to make a trip down to  urlLink toys in babeland to  film something for my schools feminist group Moxie. So I get there and this my friend is not the usual vibrator selection that you find in the corny sex shops on West 4th. This is the couture of dildos with cool names like Bear and Whale, doing things that made you wish there was a fitting room right in the store. I've always been a manual person, au natural so to speak. I was never turned on by plastic and metal rods in weird colors (pink!?!) . It just looked weird and not to mention complicated. All the cords, buttons, settings just intimidated me. Me and Rosie right hand did fine on our own but between writing and typing so much she was getting a work out! What jarred me the most was the dildo display because along with the life size, real feeling cocks (or penises) it had size along with them. THIS prompted me to want to call every guy I've slept with because I felt that I'd been lied too. Sure guys exagerrate. No man is going to try and wooo a woman with his 4 inch wonder and I certainly am not versed enough to be able to eyeball the difference between 5....6 and ..8 inches but after seeing these dildos in the store I called at least one screaming, YOU LIAR!  I've seen 8 inches today and you were not it!   Ok so what did i learn? First thing i realized is that 8 inches is bigger then i ever imagined and 6 inches isn't as small as I thought.  I walked out of that store sleepyeyed and warmly agitated  but the best part comes (no pun intended) now. It was my roomates who organized the workshop that I was filming so they came home giggly a couple of hours later. So we were talking etc. etc and I told them that I never used toys but the ones I saw to night  made me wanna change my mind. But mind you....GOOD toys are expensive. My little Bear started at a whopping 82 bucks  and the Moby (the dick not the singer) was 149 bucks! Yeah, the vibrators have cool names like Thundercat and the Beaver he he he. So my sexual upgrade had to wait.............UNTIL! my roomate hands me a little plastic package that she had gotten from Toys in Babeland. In it was a silver little egg attached to what looked like a remote control. Naaaaaaaaaah  I said.  "An egg? Not for me" I admit I was a little scared "Oh come on Diane!" she cooed and I remembered just how tired I was. I needed to sleep and I was feeling soooooo lethargic.  "Sure next time, when I get my paycheck" "You know what Diane? It's up to women to spread the love. I'll give you my eggg."  MY eyes opened like saucers. Ladies, it was 9pm and I was going to bed.   Technology is a beautiful thing.     Babies don't sleep this good.

       women are always looking for the right man. When they do find him, it's usually because they've become the right woman   this was how i prefaced my first poem at the Nuyo last night in order to score a 29.8 (it was a very high scoring night) followed by some guy who started his poem with "suck my dick". I didn't want to hear the rest but he scored a 30. Rich was there last night, which helped. My heart goes out to him, because i wouldn't have performed the way i did without his encouragement. It was nice to have encouragement ............ anyway after 3 weeks of not getting there on time or showing up early and ending up 1st on the list of 23 poets and falling to score creep, last night was my last straw. I didn't even want to get out of my bed, but i did. I wanted to make it past the wednesday night slam. A little history lesson.......  I never won a wednesday night slam until AFTER i won a friday nite slam. Whe felice was running things I had done really well in a wednesday and i gota  nod. The Wednesday nite slam is a dirty creature it is! No one is really listening, it s a battle for most memorable lines,a  battle to be remembered amongst the rubble and over the years it's gotten worse with the diversity of poets waning. With the opening of b ar 13 and most importantly urbana (Which takes a way a huge white contingent) , your'e left with this fodder   Always trying to find the right poem to slam........... sometimes you just need to be the right poet   That's what I  felt after i got off the mic. Three girls made it into the 2nd round. Me, a girl named meetch who managed to curse you out in her poem without saying a single curse (trust me it was cute) and Brady a white, antiwar political poetess... and I had to mention that. In the increasingly hip hopish slam scene women have been getting pushed out . (not 13 or sometimes even urbana but just about every where else,it is a boys club) I mentioned that, and that it was  shame and an anger rose in me as i spit aftermath. I was reeling. ANger tr anslates well at the nuyo and i took it with a 29.9. I wanted that 30.........i wanted it likea baby wants milk............  My decision to slam has been torrid, filled with contradictions which i let spill out to rich over the most delicious 8oz burger french roast has tooffer at 2 am. I'm sure it was deep, and i'm tired and all of the inspiring things that i was going to post got lost between 7 and 10 am (oh shit! i only slept 3 hours?)  Well it was great night and the highlight wasn't winning the slam, but the mashed potatoes at French Roast.   "be the change you've always wanted to be" -Ghandi  "Blaze your own fucking trail Diane" You know when things said at the right moment and in the right place hit you, in the gut. And it did. It freed alot of confusions that I've been having, alot of decisions that have needed to have been made......my concious just wanted validation, some reprive........

      "We don't have any platform," he said. "Our fight is for a better country ... We are fighting for the presidency, we're fighting for the people, for our convictions."   -Guy Philippe, a former police chief   He is also a suspected  Macoute . We don't know where we are these days. 2004 marks the 200 year anniversery of  of the slave revolt the granted Haiti it's Independence. It's been 200 years of Independence without freedom, a living contradiction that has been going on so long that it's invisible. All you can see is abject poverty, illiteracy and the biggest tradgedy of all, a loss of hope. Without hope there is no future and that is what I'm watching on my television at 3 AM. Another uproar , another civil disobedience , fueled by hunger and desperation but devoid of rememberence. And we try to remember we try, but long term memory takes a back seat to immediate needs.   After Aristide leaves, the country will return to normal," said Axel Philippe, 34, among the dozens of people gathered on the highway leading to the town, south of Gonaives.    No it will not. Haiti's never been given a fair break. The unfortunate  truth is that Haiti just does not matter very much, strategically, economically or politically, in the world as presently organized. Raped of it's natural resources, aland once plushy and green is gray and overused. Haiti when I was 5 was fucked up but gorgeous. I was too young to understand it's waning beauty, only to remember naked showers in the rain, how the mountains would light up at night as the lights from houses on the side would twinkle. I remember danger , a more organized danger going into town for yogurt or icecream or school, knowing to stay away from the men dressed in blue. They would kill you if you looked at them wrong. Crime was organized, and militarized. You knew what to do and what not to do. Then a8 years later a peasant catholic priest promises salvation by running for president. Offers cures to diseases he himself cannot diagnose. He gets caught in the ropes of a problem and a country bigger then him. No church could prepare him for the moral dilemmas that faced him. An American, all knowing, all powerful government offering him protection, for a small price....the sould of his people.....what was stronger then? Memory. Haiti mattered then. We remember that we are the first even when we forget, when we pick up arms and start shooting in the streets , because we should because it's our right, because deep in our hearts we know we deserve better then this. There is still hope but..........   We don't have any platform," he said. "Our fight is for a better country ... We are fighting for the presidency, we're fighting for the people, for our convictions."   With the middle class taking over nursing jobs, taking care of your kids, teaching, and lawyering over here in the United States and France and scattered across the carribean and Latin America, there is no intellectual middle class to sustain those. No thinking class, no philosophy. So what will happen? The first step to decolonization is anger, rebellion, deconstruction, what will exist? Petty battles amongst peasants who've lived their lives in an agricultural economy with no political experience. How do you teach morality, conviction to a country with no humanity? It's not an easy thing to watch. The rebels will oust Aristide, then they will battle amongst themselves and innocents will die and what of these lives?  "Freedome is acquired by conquest, not by gift.... It is rather the indispensable condiotn for the quest for human completion. But the struggle to be more fulll human has already befun in the authentic struggle to transfor the situaition."  what will be the discourse for humanity? I'm tired, unclear and confused..... not in my heart but in my mind to make linear what is multiversed  this is why i'm comfortable at a place like rikers, because imprisonment isn't only limited to walls but to situation. You can never step foot in jail and still be a prisoner and you can spend your life there and not be. Haiti is a giant prison. Fuck the argument to prove that , this is what I know. And the walls are alot harder to break down because it's been so compacted....I'll rewrite this later....when I'm not so tired.......... I'm not soo tired

      7:46 AM..........still no sleep. I'm supposed to be sick, not at the nuyo, hanging out at french roast till ridiculous hours, not talking on the fone with matt AFTER french roast not trying to run from my nightmares. He's not the insomniac. I am. At  least he sleeps during the day. I don't at all.    Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, said he would not step down before his term ends in February 2006, even as the United States urged him to cede power.    Some 2,200 U.S. Marines were put on alert as Pentagon (news - web sites) officials weighed the possibility of sending troops to waters off Haiti to guard against any flood of refugees and to protect the estimated 20,000 Americans in the Caribbean country    I should be writing more. I know, I am, just not here. It's not easy because in many circles, (school, work, random places) I'm asked to be the mouthpiece as to what's going on in Haiti right now it's surprisingly  not easy to verbalize it here. Here, this blog this one dimensional space calls for something much more linear, more coherent on a 2 dimensional plane and I can't do that. I'm fueled by so many things, so many forms, so many emotions and so many responsibilities callling me. I feel like i'm living two lives right now. The one I started and the one I'm destined to start living and soon. Call me and I'll tell you the blatant hypocrisy and irony that is playing out over there. In my voice you'll hear the trembling not just from fear and anxiousness but from heated excitement and hope. Why? Because though there is this much chaos there is still possibility there is still hope.  Jean Bertrand Aristide, in his last attempt at being someone worth remembering is staying in the palace in what will most likely be a suicidal last stand. Honestly, even in it's stupidity it's the most honorable thing he's done which is die for something he believes in, which is that the Macoutes are evil and that someone , at least someone should stand up to them. And people are, however they are the poorest of the poor (and in haiti that's really really really poor) and they have no telecommunications and are so ill organized that any attempt at a stand is purely emotional and suicidal. This kind of organization only comes from one place in haiti and that's money and money comes from one place and that's Macoutes.  For Aristide it's perhaps  the last stretch of  humanity left in anything Haitian because that is what haiti's been robbed of:humanity.   Contrary to popular belief I do not side with the rebels. Remnents of Duvalier's macoutes, they are a terrorist group, trained killers with no morals. They are mercenaries sent to do Papa and Baby doc's dirty deeds all across the country side. A veritable gestapo. I know this because I know how haiti has been run under Duvalier. If there was ever a polarization between good and evil this has been it. To work for Duvaliers army was to be part of the lowest and most abhorred moral class in Haiti. This would be the equivalent of showing off that your grandfather was an SS officer. In the wake of Haiti's 200 year anniversary , celebrating it's independence, she finds herself raped of all of her resources and worse yet ignored in the global fabric. She is used and now useless and the U.S. is laughing. For the rebels, this is great timing. With most of the U.S. forces focused on Iraq and Aristide's use waning (if not completely and totally expendable)there is no reason for the U.S. to intervene yet Bush's platform for raiding Afghanistan was freeing Afghani women and then liberating Kuwait and now democratizing Iraq.   Haiti HAD a free election and freely elected Aristide, but see folks Haiti doesn't have oil. If we had all, the plight of little haitian boys selling their asses on the street would be all over the news, or how the average life expectancy in haiti is 46 years old. Maybe just maybe they'd stop blaming Aids on us. ( We don't have it , that's just bullshit and that's why we marched 80,000 strong in 1990 and shut down the fucking brooklyn bridge but i bet none of y'all knew that did  you? It didn't  make the news but my 9 year old ass was THERE)  Watch. If the rebels in haiti were toting socialism, communisim or fuck it a humanism that said hey, fuck the world market, let's feed our people, you'd see how quickly Bush would intervene.  I'm leaving for Haiti this summer. If this continues , I might need to get there on a boat. This was supposed to be a graduation present now it's becoming something else. There's been alot on my mind about it, about family, about responsibilities, about loyalties. This is too dense for this page right now,this clashing of present realities, present lives the life you're living and the one you're destined for. They are too different planets and I want to stay on this one  and enjoy it a little more.  let me  please

      Yes I'm still sick. It sucks balls but on the other hand it gives me an excuse to slow down and get some stuff down. I have to write a paper on a the creation of a pedagogy for Rikers island and send my advisor what I have of my senior thesis so far. Yuck. ick!  It's not that I haven't kept up on what's been going on in Haiti, I have, I'm just kind of in observer mode at the moment. Believe you me there will be more on that later.    Most relevant   Most of my family has moved out of haiti to either florida or canada. All who's left of blood relatives are my aunt and nephews who live in Cafu fuille. We haven't heard from them but wouldn't be surprised if they were fighting with the rebels.   There will be an intense commentary starting early spring.   Film at 11

      Yeah, remembere when I said that I was having work troubles? Well I got my ass in gear and I've been doing well with my boss etc  THEN ! guess what? Last night  I get a phone call around 10 pm saying that we have no boss. In the Dorm business , this is the equivalent to getting a call in the middle of the night saying that New York City was attacked again. You have no leader, the chain of command is broken and no one knows what to do. Actually, more accurately, everyone is trying to scramble around to see who they must align themselves with politically to make sure that they either get rehired or first in line for the dope rassignment to the brand new dorm being built next semester. It's like watching the girls scramble on America's Next Top Model. (Matt, Camille is so NOT hot, just a bitch who needed to get booted).  Anyway , where does that put me? Well When my boss left suddenly in the night (for personal reasons) I was on progressively better terms with him but he's now replaced by my old boss (who gave me a stellar reccomendation for THIS job) so I guess i'm in an even better position because he likes me and will vouch for me for rehiring as long as i don't fuck up royally.  I guess it all works out  in the end and that I should very well have a place to live in the summer that's in the city. As long as I've got a roof over my head, I'm not really going to stress anything else.   2. I'm not graduating in May. This, is a concious decision. With the current job market the way it is, I'm seriously in no rush to graduate. Plus, on the real I don't want to get a job. Being someone's office assistant 9 to 5 will make me want to shoot myself, no scratch that. I'll shoot someone else. This is all I've done since highschool, if you throw  in random bartending and waitressing jobs and miscellaneous work post 9-ll , when I hit bottom working as a newspaper inserter in Williamsberg. I got paid 3 cents per piece I inserted: you do the math.  I ultimately want to apply to a doctoral program in cultural anthropology. I'm getting turned on just thinking about the free schooling, housing plus a stipend. I can live with that. See it's because  of this that I know that communism isn't such a bad idea. As long as I have a roof over my head and some food in my belly and all I have to worry about are my own personal incidentals (like beer, tampons and the nice shampoo) it seems fair.   So what am I doing? They can't MAKE Me graduate and my financial aid package won't change so it's not really costing me too much to stay an extra semester plus I have a whole semester of classes where my senior thesis is D.O.N.E. and I can bump up my g.p.a. The main reason though is this job. I get free housing as long as I stay a student and amidst my parents impending divorce I need a place to stay and no real income so far. I'm buying myself time for about 5 grand a semester. Not too shabby.  I'll also be in the Media Studies MA program getting marketable job skills, like film editing , web design and sound syncing....woohooo so that's that  3. I'm changing my blog format.  So you won't have to deal with my annoying cursor anymore. On my computer it looks and works great because well, my computer is dope. I have a sexy 19 inch flatscreen that I'm working with. (Although the one i saw in circuit city yesterday makes mine look like the ugly girl at the part) I'm also changing the format. I want a space to write my personal stuff but I also want to hold myself more accountable to the stuff I say. My inarticulateness on this thing and in many buttheading conversations (usually with oscar) stems from the fact that it's instinctual for me to be honest, but I always stop myself in fear of being rude or hurting feelings. This leads to unfinished, ill proven, non-linear unclear, rants and ravings and honestly being the stupid youngster with a loudmouth just isn't cute. anymore. I've pissed off more people then I care to kow or care to count. You can tell by the fact that I have featured most ALL the major venues, (and lots of minor ones) in new york city yet NEVER at louder arts....yet I still go. Because you learn alot from sitting in the back and actually LISTENING and not for nothing the body of work that I'm producing for my chapbook comes from that influence, though frought with tensions it is where I've matured as a writer and this is where I've cultivated my voice (though no one really hears it)  So yeah, I'm going to have two blogs. I've had two blogs, I just never publicized the second one but I'm going to  have one for personal rants and musings and the second  (this one ) for more public/political/poetical stuff. I make the seperation for one reason and that is in the seoncd one i can just go off but I think a good, readable blog has alot more effort put in to it. It's read, reread for comprehension, edited.    urlLink   People who love to obsess over things are natural bloggers. Not just because they will blog every day and sometimes multiple times per day, but also because they like to tweak, change, edit, redesign, add, remove, and fiddle around with their archives, profile, settings, template, etc.     look for some changes in the next few days  diane

      I'm desperately trying to keep my job at this moment. I've spent my entire college career on the verge of a break down. Having at least one job while interning or going to school, not to mention way too many poetry readings and slams, plus on top of that my parent's divorce, one terribly debhilitating heartbreak (heart SMASHING to be exact) THIS is the most stable two months of my who life.....and i'm hoping not to relapse. I've spent the past 3 and a half years on such a high and this semster all i have to do are my senior thesis, one class and my community word internship. (not to mention Rikers and the teach artist training program and my two jobs) Ok so maybe i still have a lot on my plate, however I don't have a set schedule and no set deadline for shit and I've just been crashing. Now all i want to do is sleep all the time....making up for the past say, 7 years?  And everything has been suffering including my Resident Assistant position. I've been here two months and I haven't made  a solid impression yet and im under the threat of not being re hired. So now, in the face of a boss who's already pissed off at me i have to try and save face and save my job, cuz i actually like this one....I get paid to live in the city and living here over summer is the best.  But seriously though...i must be lucky. Most of my problems would be solved if i won the lotto tomorrow. Seriously. I'd pay my mother off and she and my dad could get the divorce they can't afford. I put my brother iin a good private high school and he could be a rich bum. I could put my niece and nephew into a nice private school so that my sister can be crazy and stupid on her own time. Then I'd do the same thing for  Kezziah's kid Laquan....fuck I'd start a school and have my best friend tammy run it because though she's one of the few of my friends who DOESNT have a kid she'd be the best candidate for a parent. I'd buy myself a brownstone in harlem and in brooklyn and rent it out cheap to my broke ass poet friends (Guy , you can have the whole first floor with sal and the kids if you can landlord one of my buildings) I'd start my own paper so that i can say fuck you to academia and it's Phd pogram and stipend and then I could write my book on my terms......I'd have a gym and a pool and a garden back yard. I'd stop watching t.v. and travel. I'd get plastic surgery ..........'cause i can.  I'm happy now but if i'm gonna spend loads of money i think it's better spent on lipo then a diamond ring   A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat, or help you at the automat. Men grow cold as girls grow old and we all lose our charms in the end.   but why!?   But square-cut or pear-shaped these bods don't lose their shape lipo is a girl's best friend    Oh please don't hate. I'm speaking the truth  being depressed and poor is just redundant I wanna cause some damage    Life is good And I feel great Cuz mother says I was A great mistake Novocaine for the soul You'd better give me something to fill the hole Before I sputter out Before I sputter out Before I sputter out Before I sputter out   -the eels  Novacaine for the Soul

      Rat tat tat Rat tat tat What is that? But the sound of a speedbag Speeding up to match The pitch of my heartbeat Dont speak This is the sound of  Ding ding Ding ding The bell breathes life into me  Fierce eyes  Steel chin There is no mascara No lipstick To hide in   I dont fight because I want to  But because I need to And sifu When you say I can knock that motherfucker out I believe you   Boom  I get hit And I like it Because it cant get worse then this Because this is Bills More debt This is a threat to my conscience  This is scores of bad boyfriends Poems that never get written This is my last abortion This is getting cornered And horsewhipped There is no place to go  But up  there are bruises on my back from an accountant that hit me like I was a body bag my shins like like they were fitted with anal beads what fuels me? I am the sound of sneakers Hitting the concrete Feel the pulse of the rope Screaming bloodletting hyms Being a size six Is just not enough motivation To get me to a gym   This is not a poem about wrong doings of  violence this is a poem about boxing more then shadows living in the light this is about learning how to fight for the space that you occupy for knowing that no one can buy what youve been born in this is about learning to take a stand for what you believe in this is about knowing that survival means more then living   This is about being who you were meant to be By fighting off who you are About not getting hit in the Face by  Raising the bar  Rooms do spin When the 35 year cleaning lady Lands you a good one In the chin Live in the contradiction Of finding peace Something so violent Nothings louder then the silence Skin slapping Sweat dripping Tears dropping Shoulders popping out of place When two heavyweights go at it Its more graceful then ballet     You dont know your limits Until theyve been tested Dont feel the blood on your hands Breath in the sweat on your chest instead Try to open your eyes When your lids are swollen shut Discern the ringing in your ears From the sound of the bell  Two minutes left  What are you going to do with life Youve been given   Get up ?

      It's 3:08 am.....do you know where you got your last mojito?  Sadly enough, I'm more lucid drunk. I'm not saying that I'm coordinated, just more aware. (if that makes any sense at all.) This won't be a long entry, not even a really accurate account of tonights shennanigans but I'm sure it will be at the very least entertaining.    5 mojitos later on an empty stomache   I realize that when it comes down to a choice between food and alchohol, I often choose the latter. I also realized that I have a nasty habit of writing question marks when I mean periods.Why? Maybe it's my nature to question and question again or maybe it's because I don't edit enough or maybe it's Because I'm a friggin alcholic!  Spaghetti's warming up on the stove and I'm trying to stay honest and remember everything that matters   Epileptic Epiphanies   1. Mahenna movement , jessica and nina rocked at blue stockings. The waves of joy that passed over me, watching women rock the mic and rock it hard made me almost ignore the pervs that could only stare at their asses. It reminded me of my first slam, the waves of inspiration , glee and feelings of newness and possibility, something I haven't felt in a long time and I was surrounded by friends, most good, some well...........that's a whole other thesis  2. Memorable Quote  "And I got beat by the one legged guy in the wheel chair"  -Guy le charles Gonzalez  3.After a trek all OVER Loisada with the biggest group of sorta -ricans since the the Latin Image awards, we finally made it to this bar on 8th and C that served 5 dollar mojitos and played crazy salsa, merengue, mambo and ended with some pop favs. I managed to get hit on by the worlds corniest lines and hang out with the coolest folks without ONE bad incident (public)  4. That dancing accident was totally not my fault! That's what happens when you try to teach white folks how to dance  5.It's now 3:15....can you remember how many mojitos/caprinhas you had?  6. Guy is crazy, to let me co host  louder than words  with him, or rather read this as my thanks/defense mechanism that is kicking in through my surprise at someone actually valuing my opinion. (An avid conspiracy theorist and junior malcontent can only take so much) But still be there Marx 27th? and April what? Check guys blog at www.loudpoet.blogspot.com. It's late, i'm hungry and drunk, dont' ask me to remember dates or go out on them. I don't like you. go away.  7. Community Word is kicking my ASS!  urlLink Michele kotler  is a lovely woman but she's a slave driver (and sorta technically my boss) but if someone can change the world by sheer force of will she can. We have our Benefit this Sunday, I might need a date which means you can go in for 25 bucks  (donation) as opposed to a hundred. Knowing how broke ALL you fools are there's a 99% chance I'm taking my dad.  Guest Readers will be Edie Falco and Michael Imperioli from the Sopranos! oh and Mo Rocca from the Daily sHow?

Must not be afraid of heights or falling on your face in front of a couple of hundred people. Must be willing to travel to malls in middle America. Acting experience a plus   11.

      Ok, so this is it. Changes on my site. I changed the set up, now i have to change the content. What am I going for? Quality not quantity. I've already proven to myself that I can discipline myself to post everyday, question is can I discipline myself to put more time and effort? Maybe that's why  I wanted to two journals, one public and  one private but then again this serves as like a way to keep in touch with my friends without having to e-mail everyone who's not around with my business. I'll figure out a much more productive symbiosis   Just so you know what is actually different   1. No more annoying pointer. Since my computer ISN'T as old as  urlLink Guy's  children , it never bothered me but  it seemed to annoy alot of people, so I got rid of it.  2. Though the main image is big,the site is pretty skinny compared to my last one. If it's still too fat, please tell me so that I  can trim it.  3. I went for a more streamline look that had nuanced quirks. The other site was too ostentatious...kind of like matt's chatterbox. ;) I'm going for content so I'm trying to have less typos and what not on my blog. It won't happen over night but I'm working on it.  I have too much to say to say it as inarticulately as I do.....actually....i'm lying. The Queer Eye Guys came to my site and told me that I needed to change it.  4. Tagboard and comments are still here and I added a cute little  urlLink imood  a throwback to dawn's blog. I'll see how I feel about this  5. I 've also added a Prison Bitch Name Generator which I'm sure NO ONE has (see also the hobbit name generator that I have a link to) I don't know how long I'm going to keep this but we'll see. I welcome suggestions  I hope this keeps you entertained for a little bit.

      Doing this quiz is ironic since I've decided that I'm not   really   a poet I just happen to rhyme alot. but then again, that sounds like something Walt might say, but then again he had alot more self confidence then I do. 		   You are Walt Whitman!  Champion of the Transcendentalist American Ideal, Walt Whitman is one of the first poets to use the "free verse" form in America.  He has been imitated, but will never be duplicated, just like you!  Except for by everyone else who gets Walt Whitman ;)    urlLink   Which famous poet are you?

      Hi, I can't stay long. I have to go to class. Yes, I actually have those?  For once I actually I have my homework in  on time and I'm going to be spending this spring break catching up on TONS of work before I start teaching again at Rikers but onto FUN stuff!  I just re-edited Fight like a girl, arguably one of my best scoring and least inspiring pieces, but guess what? I like it! why? because of my not so secret fantasies of being cool enough to be a rapper. Sure I got the rhymes but I certainly don't  have the swagger/flow and this poem is totally me play acting  What's that? but the sound of the speedbag speeding up to match the pitch of my heartbeat this is the sound of sneakers hitting  concrete   Oh yeah Raquim and his 7 MC Theory, thanks Mike for the late nite flow talks , they helped and MUCH MUCH props to my resident TJ who stayed up last nite helping me with my rythm (I apparently have none)  So yup. I 'm slamming at the nuyo 2nite against Morris Stegasarus? He's the only one that I know is slamming for sure, that will be cool. I'm not expecting to win, but I do want to have fun and if my friends are there that will most certainly happen  So BE THERE or be SQUARE  and of course there will be either french roast or that salsa place after the show....so let's go!

      So I called..........  out of curiousity, out of loneliness, wondering if we lived out the dreams we set out when we were 15. I called his old number and his mom answered. She's a really nice woman. We had yet another 15 minute converstation then she told me that he had his own place in Harlem and gave me the number there. Some guy answered and I immediately thougth maybe I had the wrong number but asked for him anyway   Hey.....  hi?....  Umm....this is diane...from highschool?    I had no idea how to introduce myself.  Oh HI! I'm the girl you sat on the fone hacking with every nite from 7 to midnite for 4 years. We shared all our hopes and dreams. Remember me?   When he remembered he laughed, asked what I was up to and the catching up ensued. We remembered fondly tne nuyorican, back in those days. I was the one who wanted to leave new york but wound up staying and growing up with new york. Each neighborhood changing faces as I grew into the woman I never envisioned but always hoped I'd be  He on the other hand........fell in love with Boston. Always the rebel, he surprisingly took well convservatory life and clean sidewalks. The smells of Washington Heights had long become a distant memory for him. He had not turned out how I'd imagined still we ended up living up to our own dreams.   We laughed about how we wanted to get an apartment in the Lower East Side when alphabet city was still considered kinda scary after dark. We were gonna be waiters and be artists. He remembered. I was surprised. I wasn't in either shock or awe,blissfully so over that, but that's natural. I grew up.........or just grew....  He runs a children's choir now and wants to be a professional chorister. Far cry from the dj-ing , graffiti writer I grew up with. I told him I was a writer and he said he wasn't surprised.  He mentioned something about having coffee..........I said.....notice it's been X years and we still haven't met?  he laughed....

      After making headway hanging out at the Community Word Benefit with my dad, I've moved about 3 steps back by letting him read my blog.  If you want to know where my demeanor comes from , spend 15 minutes with him   I come from a long line of judgemental malcontents....... imagine, marx, guy and F Omar Telan rolled into one! That's my dad  Yesterday was a very interesting day.  As I'm making last minute calls to councilmen, trying to get them to come to the Community Word Project Benefit I saunter upon this one secretary. I'm practically begging her to send a representative, talking up CWP and such and she gives me her e-mail address and asks me to send the information. She spells out her last name and I pause   "Is that name Irish? or English"  "English, (laugh) we come from the mountains"  "It's an interesting name, not common. I've only known one other person with that name and his first name was strange too. His name was ----------n"  "That's my son!"  "You're son? Did he go to Stuyvesant Highschool?"  "Yes! and then..."  "NEC for voice...yeah I remember..............."  The conversation trailed off for a bit.... I remembered alot about her son, wondering how much she knew about me, realizing probably very little. Our courtship was somewhat ....eccentric, in traditional Diane Style. I'll start at the beginning.  I grew up in Flushing Queens with my girls Tamz, and Kez and Andy, Neala, Rosa, the Rollerblade crew of Badboys on Kew Gardens. We were immigrant hiphoppers who knew how to say "Hi can I speak to --------" in Korean, Spanish, Hebrew and  Hindu.   When my parents finally decided to move, we ended up on the border between queens and long island in Valley Stream. This was about 15 minutes away from my old neighborhood but for a 14 yr old who couldnt drive it was sooooooooooo far. Well AOL had just come out and you were cool if you had it. AOL at the time also charged per hour and it was a ridiculous bill and the eventual unlimited plan came out because of raggedy ann teens like us   "We were the grafitti artists of this digital nation/knowing that knowledge was power/ we got higher and higher smoking blunts made out of web pages"   NO BODY PAID FOR AOL who was under 18 and lived in Queens and into Hip Hop.This was 1995 BABY! Between Proggies,Credit Card Fishing CC generators and Social Engineering, we scammed our way all round this virtual space. This was back when Kuttin Kandy was still underground, like living in her parent's basement still in highschool underground and this was how I met ----N  There was a hip hop chat room that I "hung out " in with my friends. It was a mix of my old Junior High School buddies and some folks I didn't know. He was one of them. One day I got a tip that a bunch of kids in my area were gettign busted and a mixture of a love for drama, youth, paranoia and a little bit of ACTUAL danger (this was right before the new FCC regulations which would have charged us as adults came into effect) I posted that I needed a place to crash. He volunteered. He was 15 and a tenor that studied voice, was a "turntabalist" , a grafitti artist and malcontent that lived in Washington Heights and i was smitten...  I never got arrested, it was just some ass playnig a prank on me, we talked every day for about 4 years.........and I never met him. I was supposed to.......once. It was junior year and I was like hey ------N , notice that we've never met and in his smoother then smooth coolness said "yeah.........that's funny isn't it?" It was comfortable, like online was, no faces, no places, just feelings and ideas.... He was battling at the next BEAT competition happening at none other then the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. I showed up decked out and nervous as hell. I saw the back of cap....... My heart stopped and I ran out He asked me where I was,we never really talked about it. We used to daydream about how one day we'd both be  real  artists and we'd get an apartment in the lower east side and be waiters and such and live La Vie Boheme..........funny how things work out......around college we lost touch.....  I found a picture of him online at New England Conservatory, arms around some girl who looked well.........not very Washington Heights  Years later I adopted the Nuyorican, under my own terms, doing my own things there, building my own network. I finally did end up falling in love there,just not with him.   "Well He's back in New York now, teaching music to some kids downtown"  "oh...."  "you should give him a call, he's still living at home"     I always joked that one day we'd meet up and strike up a conversation and then later on realize who we were when we gave out our names.   I've moved so many times he would have no idea how to reach me. So ball's in my court? Do I call? I do I let this higschool tryst bury itself?  Please VOTE!

      You're probably wondering what this is? This is new years resolution number 42.  "When you look in the mirror become what you were meant to be"     On a third dimension plane  the shortest distance  between point  B and  _________  point A   is a straight line  and time  only moves in one direction  but I  have a tendency to meander     I've christened this blog  urlLink  TesserPoem    after the Tessaract, a sort of pseudo scientific idea from the Madeline L'Engle book   A Wrinkle in Time     In it the characters Tessered, a term used for traveling through space by bending the time space continuum. I thought that this could happen here. Take space out of the equation and create a virtual workshop. So when you wanna post a poem,you can post it here for critique. If you're feeling more social go check out personal blogs. Just one more thing to get addicted to   I've been working on my chap book, my first chap book, anxious to put some work behind me, to lay some poems to bed to commit them to whatever place they have in my literary life so that I can move on, intellectually, spiritually, emotionally and poetically, but I've been writing in a vacuum. My workshops have always been informal....random dinners, long winded talks over beers and cigarettes. Seeing the growth of the public sphere online through blogging , I was struck with an idea? how about stepping it up a little and create a virtual workshop space. I know that we all post poems on our blogs randomly but the blogs (mine) have become a little too full? I kept having this problem in which I wanted to write personal journal entries, and other days post poems for critique and other days get involved in a public discussion that circled around many blogs.   So anyway I was struck with an idea! How about a place specifically built for that, where everyday a new poem was featured and the comment section which is left unused in most blogs except for randomly talking shit, could be harnessed into a productive critique. Sounds like an idea!   So here's how it works!   1. If you have a blog e-mail me so that I can give you admin access so you can post a poem.   2. If you don't have a blog you can e-mail me and I'll post if for you   3. I will not edit or censor anything   4. Posting anonymously is not only allowed but encouraged! Since for now we all know each other it might keep things simpler especially if we are not concerened with finding out people's b usiness through their poetry   5. This is new and exciting. I don't know the kinks yet but i'm anxious to find out! I'll post first!    urlLink So go check out  POEM a DAY   1-2 poems posted a day  Voyeurs discouraged!  say what you feel!

      oh adam.....you're quite the sexy one, but I'm leaving you....for Jessee, the keyboardest.  Jesse, forget what anyone says,it's your keyboards that keep me listening toM5. Did i mention that albeit you have great bone structure when you shave, you are soooooo  hot with a beard. Yeah, and though people think Adam brings in the soul, i know it's you. by the way, who is this Rashida woman that does background vocals? Are you dating her? Tell me the truth Jesse, I can take it. I guess I'll see you next life time.    Meanwhile back on earth...........    I went to go see a new experimental play  Siddhartha .  urlLink  Bass  had a friend who was in it, so after walking around virgin Records reading the Goomba's Guide to Love, we went downtown to the Theatre Source. Very small intimate place, the actors all dressed in black, props and scenery  minimal to nil. This kind of set up requires you to write  better. There's no lighting, music , etc to add drama. Just words and good acting and singing and blocking.  Long story short, good time,very enlightening.... *sigh* this weeks been rough and this?  it was just what I had needed. It was about a man's spiritual journey, he needed to leave..........just like I do.  He needed to go out and experience life and love and hurt and pain.  The lead was played by this man.  This man.  There was something about him. Ok, he was playing a spiritual leader, still I got the eye, this curiousity, I wanted to know him.......ask him where he'd been  "diane it was just a character"  and he  played it with so much passion, and conviction......    fastforward   Afterparty with the cast and the director. He wanted notes. I gave them to him and Sid (I won't say his real name) was standing right there. As soon as I walked in our eyes locked. I blushed and looked away. Later on we were standing in the same circle....  Sid: "yeah, and the layers of metaphors illuminate the ideas through action, showing NOT telling" Diane: "Exactly"...  Eyes lock again. It must  be just me. He's not really staring......STOP IT!   awkard moment #11   Bassey: It's getting late , I'm going home Diane:Give me 5 minutes? I'll go with you. I don't know anyone here Sid: So you write too? Diane (thinking): This man is NOT trying to get to see me again! is he?  I say that he did a wonderful job and that it was nice meeting him and I turn and walk away to get my coat. I'm putting on my coat, I feel a tap on my shoulder. Eyes lock again. I blush  e-mail addresses are exchanged. I walk away cool mouthing to bassey "please don't laugh!"  Later on, she tells me that he's engaged to another woman. I nestle in the moment for a little bit, happy it happened , remembering the lyrics to the musical we had just seen.    "You are here where you are   Choose what you do   Do what you choose"   We don't always need a vamp at the end of our musicals.    End of story

      Updates.  urlLink Don't forget Louder Than Words this Saturday  Guy, Eric and Helen will be hosting. It will be cool as the first two shows are going to be sort of experimental. I still have to send Guy some format ideas. I'm going to stay up late tonigt 'researching"  Speaking of researching I checked out the hits on my  urlLink sitemeter  and my number has increase however I can account for only maybe like 5 IP addresses, which means that a bunch of folks I may not know or more accurately, I may not think are reading this are.  Case in point, Michelllle Kotller who googled her name and found out that I called her a slave driver in my blog. Granted it was in jest, and in context she realized it was compliment (I've noticed that I rarely give compliments without qualifiers. go figure) however, I guess it was a cosmic reminder to be more accountable about what I write, since I really don't know who's reading. I think my dad purposely AVOIDS my blog.  Anyway, there's a place on sitemeter where you can check how people are finding you. So I have links from other blogs, Rich's , jessica's, guy's etc, that's fine but what cracks me up is the google searches. It's what people type and end up finding my page. It's hilarous.   Top 5 Google Searches that Resulted in getting to my blog   "Hacker Name Generator" "back door nyc" "poem about being sick" "kurtrussel"  and last but not least  dysfuntional chaos   Onto something that you might actually CARE about reading.  I got some CD's. (Matt you'll be proud to hear that I paid for them as well) Here are my reviews.    Maroon 5 -Songs about Jane    This girl Jane must have been something because I'm on my 10th listen today alone. I had bootlegs of several of their singles but the album is worth buying. Take it from someone who hasn't bought a CD in 3 years. I'm an avid downloader I admit it without guilt. I need to see these boys live. Seriously. I've never followed bands, just hot singles.  urlLink Bassey  is so in love with Adam Levine, he's cool but..........gimme Ryan the drummer or Jesse the bassist ANY Day of the week. No, I'm not a groupie. I'm a BANDAID! I'm just here to love the music man....just love the music    Joss Stone-The Soul Sessions    Very reticent about  buying this album, thinking that it would  have been a repeat of a nikka costa one hit wonder type situation, however this was the best surprise. It's actually a really dope album and for a 16 year old white girl from england, she's got a helluva lot of soul. Totally worth buying, not burning.........but if you want i'll burn you a copy! Free music ! Free music!    Alicia Keys-Diary of Alicia Keys   Disappointed, really disappointed. Almost as disappointed as I was seeing Panic Room. Directed by David Fincher (The guy who directed Fight Club, Seven , The Game AND Alien 3) I had expected more...maybe he just blew a socket, however! Alicia needs to stop. I should have listened to Eliel, I should have went with my gut and gotten the Christina Aguilera CD. I like at least 3 of the singles (The voice with and beautiful  always make me cry ) so even if the whole album was awful I would have been fine, but no... I got Alicia Key's diary. No more details, just don't get it.  I also got some comics.  I got  Fallen Angels  and a collection of  Matrix  comics by different artists. I didn't get American Splendor cuz it was too expensive and then I dropped 20 on the friggin matrix. What's wrong with me?  Sianara

        It's Botox and it's Topical! It's Botopical!     -Infomercial at 4:52 AM.     So I lied. I'm still around. One thing about hiding out is that it's boring and it leaves ample time for dvd renting and provides alot of blog fodder. So deal  I've made up a new word. It's called  Rutting.  That's what I'm doing  right now. Rutting.It comes from the noun rut as in   I am currently in a rut   I've changed it into a verb so, I am now in the proces of rutting. My rutting is turning out to be a somewhat fruitful venture. It's allowing for some painful introspectionand self-analysis.  urlLink "The artist is always eons ahead of the (wo)man"  Bullshit.    Me, myself and I are  far ahead of my artistry. I live much braver then I write. *sighI need to get out of dodge. I've been in new york way too long. Same situations, different faces, it's all become to formulaic,no longer organic.....hence the rutting.    Changes     1.  I know I have  nasty habit of interrupting people. It's not because  I'm not listening (though it comes off that way) I listen! I swear!If I didn't think you had anything intelligent to say , I wouldn't talk to you! at all! Believe me! I'm a very judgemental person with slight episodes of megalomania; If I didn't respect what you had to say, I'd let you know (loudly if I found you particularly obnoxious, or simply politely ignore you. If you don't see me around, it's probably because i think that you're dumb)I simply experience some sort of turrets in which I THINK i'm making mental notes and  they just come SHOOTING out of my mouth. hence me screaming  urlLink "YOU'RE SEXY"  or  "Yeah! I'm totally feeling you!" "he IS the worst poet I ever heard" or "You know, I wrote a poem  about JUST that"    I apologize.  I'm working on it.  Now, when I talk on the phone, I press mute. I can interject with my peanut gallery comments  without disrespecting the other person or ruining their flow. Ah, compromise and progress.    2.  I'm getting into comic books. Mostly because of my experience filming.  Though I can't draw very well the visual medium is such a powerful tool and I'm learning alot  through my own storyboarding (One is that i'm good at story boarding) One story board that  impressed me was on the 28 days later DVD . There was a radical alternate ending that was  never filmed but was story boarded and quite well. On my list of comics to get when I get paid are   Fallen Angels  The latest issue of  American Splendor    Aquaman   The Matrix  Comic (I'm thinking of starting my own)  Any suggestions please drop them off. I'm trying to stay away from the biggies, like batman, spiderman,superman,hellboy, the punisher... but I know that I might end up indulging  in Catwoman or X-Men.    3.  Took my brother to go see  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  which kicked the Passion of the Christ out of the number one spot. I was happy about that. Here's my opinion on J.C.  (*drum roll please?)  He died for something he believed in. Believed in enough to take on all the sins of man. (I say MAN  cuz those bastards blamed everything on women, I'll pull a Dave Chappelle and do the same thing.It's not  urlLink nuanced  some people might like   but oh well.) I'm not going to go see a movie that's going to use  violence to manipulate me into feeling sorry for the man, why?   IT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY! THAT's WHAT HAPPENS WHEN  YOU SIGN UP TO DIE FOR SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN!  Jeeeeeeeeesus! (no pun intended)  And besides I can't stomache that violence, nor can I stomache the violence that the  slaves endured on the Atlantic Slave trade, or the 500 years of abuse through out the Americas, nor can I stomache the violence of capitalism overseas . Wanna see violence? I'll show you violence!        Now THAT is violence!  I don't feel like getting manipulated into false pity, cuz that's what it would be: false. The visual media is powerful, and distorts invisibly and effortlessly. Tell me something about what Jesus stood for, what he believed in. Tell me about the loads of text between the  ages 12 and 33. Tell about what Jesus thought about the church, about all the secret texts the Vatican won't let out.Tell me about THAT! don't force me into pitying a willing martyr in order to cash in on this country's already low moral economy. Just another excuse to co-op faith. I'll keep my ten-bucks-thank-you-very-much  I'd rather go see zombies.   The movie was alright. The OVERT product placement got annoying but what can you do? It didn't have the political poignancy of George A Romero's Classic. It totally overlooked the poignancy of  the original Night of the Living Dead. Running zombies change the entire game when it comes to the historically political nature of the horror genre. If you want a qualifier for that last comment you'll have to ask for it specifically,  I'm too tired to go into zombie film theory. (can you SMELL the ranting frustration?)  so..... QUESTION!    (let's indulge in my post-apocalyptic fantasies)      A)  If the population of the world ceased to exist, how would it most likely go and why ?         a. There would be no more room in hell and the dead would walk the earth (ala Dawn of the Dead)        b. A plague or epidemic would wipe out the world turning everyone into running zombies (28 days Later)        c. A plague disguised as the flue (ala the Stand)        d. Massive Floods (Water World)        e. Killer Aliens trying to reap from our resources (Ala Independence Day/Signs)        f. Killer Aliens taking over our minds and turning us into slaves (ala Invasion of the Body Snatchers)        g. The second coming of the Ice Age (The Day afte Tomorrow coming out May 2004)        h. AI (Artificial Intelligence) goes completely awry and the computers we build control us (The Matrix/Reloaded/Revolutions)   B)  What would be your plan for survival?      C)  If you could build a team of 20 survivors (assuming your family is already counted outside of this 10) who would you pick to start a brand new world??  Only thing is they have to be living, no historical figures, cartoons, or republicans.     indulge me role players, indulge me.

       Recap of Friday Night   1. Morris Stegasaurous (is that how you spell it?) ROCKS! and rocks hard. He kept it majorly real, staying true to himself and original     through out the whole slam. I wish I had lost to him, instead of losing to yet another shitty male poet prettier than I am. He finished out the 3rd round in a BUNNY SUIT doing a parody of Saul Williams screaming    I am that bunny! I am that bunny! I am that bunny! I am that TIMELESS BUNNY!    All I have to say is "Sha clack clack , doc"  2. Celena Glenn is hot. I want to have her babies and it's not cause I like her poetry.  3. I lost to yet ANOTHER pretty black man.  4. It was a fun night. Had a lot on my mind. My girls from Queens, Tamz, Lissette, and Bridgette came out. It Bridgette's first time seeing me read and Lissette's second. I grew with these girls and it's so weird, I feel like I lead a double life. They found out alot about me through my work, stuff I never said...........it just wasn't important, somethings don't want to be articulated. It's weird, i get so nervous in front of them, but last night was different, I felt proud and loved. It was a good night.I can't write any more.

      I'm more tired and cranky that I can mouth. I know that this is just a general/generic complaint, in fact you're probably asking yourself with the amount of time that I spend blogging when and where do I even have time to go to school.   This semester wasn't supposed to be as hard as it is. Maybe it's not the semester, maybe it's just me.  Running on this kind of adrenaline with no break hasn't been good for me. I've been doing it since 9/11.  At first it was just a hard semester, each following one, I'd say to myself,  "Diane if you can get through this then it gets easier"  it doesnt.  At first it was just a hard semester, then it's become something more of a habit, an addiction.   The bags and dark circles under my eyes are not attractive, I know this. I've had the same tired smile on for some years now. Maybe I just bury my depression in my work, but no......that would be way to easy.  It's the other way around. As much as I hate academia (or more specifically academics), like any writer my self worth is based on what I produce, thus the more work I produce the better I am right? This idea goes out the window when you've produced not one SINGULARLY ORIGINAL IDEA!  I stopped  trying  to be happy a long time ago. "I'm better then that" I thought. I wanted to be something more important, something more tangible, something that lasted longer and affected more people. I wanted something that trivialized the emptiness in my heart..........  now i sit , amidst a thesis that my never get written, poems that make me puke, unfinished short stories.....I spilled coffee on them... and I don't care  My fone is running out of charge   "This city's made us crazy and we must get out"  -Maroon 5

      I'm supposed to be working on homework and I'm typing up the louder then notes that I had taken while at the merch table.  this is the beginning of a beautful __ _________ (fill in the blank)    I think this could be areally cool thing. Tons of folks showed up.(louder then I expected) and the format ran louder than smoothly, though it still needs some tightening.   (If you haven't  noticed, i'm trying to put louder then in as many places as possible. Search Engine fodder, you should try it)  This computer that I'm on is really slow. It crashes everytime I try to look at my blog. Go figure.  Louder next time  Diane

      My therapist wrote me a letter, not one of those generic typed ones, but a nicely handwritten letter.  When I opened it up, even the handwriting was friendly and inviting........   didn't bite.   I don't know why I even bother. I've never seen one more than three times. I just can't be that intimate with a stranger  much less someone I actually care about. Honestly, she just got hooked to my stories. I lie before we get to anything good or important. They just get very interested in the details of my life and not what's actually going on. I've been told that my life is like a black Fellini movie.....whatever that means.   I don't need therapy. I know this. No stranger is going to tell me things about myself that I don't know, but maybe they'll prescribe something nice.   Sure you know all the angles , you just don't have the stones to play em -Mike to Knish in Rounders(1998)   On another note    I have two zits.........both of them on my chin, one is way bigger than the other. I'm not prone to acne, the occaisional blackhead that I can pop, but nooooooo this ones a virgin, the kind you can't pop and she's got a little sister and all I can think is   Big blind/little blind   now I'm thinking in poker. Yes........I have a  urlLink dirty secret.  I want to pop her but I can hear Pauly's voice in my head   "You gotta defend your blind no matter what you got"   Ok, maybe I'm dramatizing a little but that hand I won on  urlLink monday  nite? That was a full house Jacks over Kings NOT twos. ;)   If you didn't understand what I just wrote, move on to the poetic portion of the entry     Monday was the the semi-finals draw , but I had to go see about a game. The details of why I decided to sit down at a poker game with a hundred dollar buy-in hosts details relevant only to me, but I did. Texted Matt around two and told him to proxy if I wasn't there. Even THAT i was shaky on because I'd been going back and forth all weekend as to whether or not I'd even participate in semis. I told myself that Monday evening would make my decision for me, that things would clear up as I played....and they did.  If you want a run down, check it out at  urlLink Pauly's site      P.S. COMING NEXT WEEK!   It's conspiracy theory week. I know you love them, so in order to make up for this weeks meager entries, it'll be one conspiracy theory a day.   The first one's going to be about the relationship between Jerry Springer and Orwell's 1984. I was watching it this morning and it reminded me of the Hate Rallies that Orwell described. I'm not implicating George Bush directly, but I think that Springer is being funded by the Conservative Right , in order to indoctrinate lonely housewives, college dropouts and the unemployed into a hate group that includes a larger cross section of people.   While this is ineffective in progressive left organizing, hate is a powerful unifying force for the right wing.   film at 11

        Did Last Night Really Happen?    And no, not in that way. I woke up early this morning still reeling. Ever have one of those nights that seem to start early and never really end? Or a night that went on much longer than you intended?  Last night was looooooooooong, in fact it's still going on, especially since the sun hasn't come out yet.  If you're looking for a semis-wrap up, you'll have to look  urlLink elsewhere . I spent most of the night in the back stairwell and the coat closet at 13. I was in and out of zones, not competing with anyone but myself.  Here was the final Tally for the Evening  1.Celena (112.1) 2.Bonafide (111.2) 3.Abena (108.8) 4.Jive (107.2) 5.Diane  (107.5)   Supposedly, without the time penalties I would have been in 3rd place and on my way to finals. Oh well. I've lost slams before. Plenty of them. Sometimes the crowd feels you and sometimes they don't. It happens to best of us. Despite what many may say, I'm not a competitive person at all. I've never liked the slam. I've always thought that it could bring  alot of good to the boring old academic reading, that it could inspire those who don't write to write, but i've never LIKED it. I've accepted it and dealt with it. I never slammed more than I need to , to qualify. If i didn't think I had a chance at winning ,  i didn't do it, and by winning i meant getting something out of it, money, a feature, recoginization, placement into semis to make a team and get exposure.  It's not like its a debate that where something good might come out of an intelligent discussion, it's a smackdown and for someone like me who is under the belief that everyone's story is important, this isn't something I'm likely to succeed at. I liked the work of everyone I was up against so it was really difficult to think of the slam in terms of competing against THEM.     As I said before I spent most of the night in the back stairwell, with Jai, Ray and Matt, all taking turns therapizing me. Sure, I get nervous, but I was pretty rattled by my first time penalty but not surprised. I practiced, but if there was any poem that I can expect to go over time it's aftermath. I've cut and cut, but the more relaxed I am on stage the slower I go and then in the middle of it I just don't care about the slam, it becomes about the performance and I just can't bring myself to rush it. oh well............ ;)  in the end it wasn't about the poetry, the paranoia, the resentment, the feelings of love and feelings of abandonment, it wasn't about the liquor, or the pretentions or the conventions and it certainly wasn't about the points. I left my guts out there only to realize that I had alot more then I anticipated.  and I had fun. Thanks to my newschool buddies who came out in full force. Ian, Toby, Emily, Amelie, Dot.I love y'all and you're the best. Lang wouldn't have been the same without you guys, and I know that thread the binds our lives is long winded. I can't wait to see what our kids end up like, what we end up like. You keep the struggle grounded and steamheaded by feelings of geniuine love for the world.    Thanks  Jai and Ray . Your commitment to making art inspires me. Your souls are inspiring. When I think  of poetry I see y'all, you live it, without even knowing.   Dyanna,  I know you couldn't be there, but i felt the support anyway. Girl you always keep it real, and you let me know that I'm really not crazy. Maybe a little dramatic, slighly paranoid and occassionally nutty, but not crazy.    Ed,  I was gonna blow the last round out of the water with a 10 minute piece. You talked me out of it, and  let me do justice to the piece. Thanks.     And matthew......   Your work, and the way it's grown peripheral to the slam has taught me alot bout process and above all else about ego. I just don't get it..... you are relentless in your honesty, though less optimistic much more open then I can ever aspire to be.  You've become one of my closest friends, despite the fights, the histrionics, the headbutting, you've managed to stand there, solid, unwilling to let me expect less from myself.   You expect me to be better, because you know I can and I've needed that. Always too proud to admit it, but I have needed that ..................... so thank you   and that's what has gotten me through, and helped me realize last night's importance. A week from now no one will remember it, but i will.  It was the beginning of the rest of my life.......................  Good Luck to Bonafide, Celena and Abena! Good job y'all!

           My Beef with Dave Chappelle   I realized if I could draw, I'd be Aaron Mcruder. No....seriously.....I've been spending far  too much time at Forbidden Planet lately and now all the nerd boys are eyeing me funny. I've never really been a comic book person who's "into the art",  but I do appreciate the power of symbols and the visual medium. The Satire likes, in little Huey's disdaining look at us the audience. What shocks you is that  though Huey is the supposed to be the paranoid, consipiracy, ultra leftist aspiring revolutionary,  he's got a point, and lots of them and you know what? They make sense. But it's that look, the drives it on home, the look that says "You should know  better" and you know what? That's funny.   So I got into a discussion about Satire the other day and I argued that satire is one of the most difficult  and ultimately useless genres around. Satire  seeks to create a shock of recognition and to make that  "vice"  repulsive so that the vice  will be wiped out from the discussion.  The formula for satire is one of honey and medicine. First you ridiculize the targeted idea/person/belief  to the point of evoking total derision then create another equally ridiculous alternative reality. While  most satirists do the first part, very few do the second.  The shock is supposed to do all of the work , while it is the audience's responsibility to be visionaries.  If the lumpen proletariat consisted of visionaries then we'd all be crazy poets but that's not the case now is it?  but then again why is that idea so ridiculous?  so the person I was having  this discussion with said something about "Dave Chappelle [being ] brilliant ",  and I kind of well...........flipped. Dave Chappelle has his funny moments but I won't go as far as saying  that he's brilliant.   "Is Diane Roy  gonna have to choke a bitch?"   The Sketch Comedy format blends together In Living Color (minus the fly girls) and at times we  get the political kicker of say Chris Rock, and yes it CAN be funny, but between the Crack Head and  the Rick James bit, how much of the second does Chappelle actually give us. Though on one hand I find him funny,  the other hand finds him disappointing. Marketing himself as "dangerous" because he's soooooo edgy, Chappelle  is no malcolm x, frantz fanon, or MLK.  He's also no Onion nor is he Mark Twain. He's simply Dave.  so I guess the real question is,  Is Dave Chappelle Funny? or Offensive ?  or more specifically,  Does Chappelle challenge racist stereotypes or does he simply reinscribe them.   As I stated before, satire requires an element of shock but what makes it successful is the vision  the it creates in it's wake. A show that does this well is SouthPark.    "But Diane, what really bothers you is the fact that white people like Chappelle too"    YES! how dangerous can you be if WHITE PEOPLE like you? I'm not talking about  psuedo progressive  black studies professors at NYU  and  I'm not just talking about old white republicans, rich conservative  basket ball players(michael jordan)  and condaleeza rice, I'm talking about your white aunts and uncles  who now think it's ok to scream out of their s.u.v.s "I'm Rick James Bitch!"  Did you not see Bamboozled! Long has Satire been used has an excuse to reinscribe racist stereotypes on t.v.   of course white people find funny depictions of black crackheads (when was the last time you saw a  white crack head on t.v.?) but not for the same reasons we (non-white) people do.  Of course I find that  suspicious because it makes me question what images Chappelle is putting out there.  What alternative  vision is he creating?  On SouthPark   This D.C. native began performing stand-up comedy in area nightclubs at age fourteen.  What sets him apart is his signature willingness to mock his own race ? and every other.  One result is a TV show that asks audiences to question their reaction to his offensive material.    - Kate Conner-Ruben from www.arborweb.com   Though his intention is to be satirical, that doesn't mean that he's successful.  In alot of ways my  relationship to the Chappelle show is kind of like my relationship with hip hop. You don't want to  support the glorfication of blackness= violence, sex, bling etc on the other hand you wanna dance  cuz that beat is bumping. I watch Chappelle in my room on my own , and comfortable in my skin, but it's like he's sharing a  private joke that I don't want shared with white people.  Yeah I said it.  But on the other hand his penchant for lowbrow humor can be insightful and it's successul at times. Examples   Trading Spouses The Racial Draft The Wayne Brady Episode Reparations Ask a Black Dude.   Now mind you most of these are from his first season and when he was  just making fun of white people and no one was really feeling him. One thing no one's taken into account is that he didn't really blow up until he started making fun of black people.   Here's what some other white people said about Chappelle   Although the controversial skit could be viewed as perpetuating age-old  stereotypes that blacks are lazy and don't pay their bills on time, we know  Chappelle is really saying it's OK to laugh at ourselves and our perceived differences.  -By Kevin D. Thompson COX NEWS SERVICE    ummmm yeah......     but on the other hand maybe it puts discussion about race into the public sphere maybe then white people will want to talk about race   These days, nobody makes me laugh louder than Dave Chappelle.   This show makes you laugh until it hurts too much not to laugh at the racist idiocy we typically take so seriously. -Tony Norman www.post-gazette.com   Who is this WE that takes race so damned seriously............lol  Well now that this is solved we  can get to the fucking until we're all the same color and then it will be a purely class construct.   hmmph!

      ok, I know that it's supposed to be Conspiracy Theory week but I'm going to put that on hold for a little bit, or better yet, I'll blog my Senior Thesis instead and let THAT marinate for a little bit.  This is the part of myself that gets mentioned but never extrapolated or explained. When asked who I am or what I do, I give my most succint response: I'm a writer. I write everything and when I get tired I try another genre.  When followed by "Why?What got you to write" Again, the most succint non-evasive answer you'll EVER get out of me  Because I  gave up and submitted.  It's the only thing/person I've ever done that with and even then it's still hard as heck.  I ran into Steve Coleman and Sara Jones outside of the computer lab at my school and actually went up to them. I said hi, they gave me flyers to a show that Sarah is doing and I felt the warm breeze and let waves of nostalgia pass over me.   Me, 19, Lower East Side/Brooklyn 2001 Listened to: Jill Scott, Nancy Wilson, Music  Soul Child, Gangstarr, Sade, The Karl Marx Band Read: German Ideology, The Birth of the Prison, Vice/Greed, Burning Down the House  Felt: Excited, scared, strong,hurt, clear   These moments have been coming around more and  more frequently as I stand on yet another brink of my imagination , where I have to reimagine my future and I see ............ nothing. no clue where i'm going to be in 5 years much less 5 months  and I am sick of people telling me how exciting this should be and how grateful I should be. I don't deal well with not being in control because life does not deal me good cards never has and I doubt ever will.  I'm happy now and I don't know how to get used to it. Living crisis to crisis has left scars deeper than I imagined and now they are barring me from moving forward. My concious stuck in quicksand, I've become my worst enemy.........   soo........     I had a realization yesterday.In the middle of listening to  Dashboard Confessional , I realized how little I knew about a friend of mine. I could tell you title tracks but never really experience the day to day trials, questions, the dark places in which he goes to and is always reluctant to let me follow.  I asked myself how much did I really want to know, how far down into the rabbit hole was I willing to follow him and my reticence in answering gave me more answers then I was ready for.  So after 22 years of living here's what I've learned  1. Learn to Accept People for who they are, not who they are trying to be;make decisions accordingly  2. Debt is bad. Pay your shit off.  3. Live for a living, it's a choice  4.Refill your CD collection at LEAST every six months.  5. Clean up your Relationships every 6 months. Not everything is supposed to last for ever. Understand people and their place in your life  6. At least once you should leave without town telling anyone. See who you become without the pressure to be who you were  7. Think twice before faking your own death, insurance people WILL find you   8. The  urlLink unabomber  is way more progressive than Dave Chappelle  9. Quentin Terantino is a racist misogynist who fetishes women and black people.  10. Sex is good. Great Sex is Even Better. Sex, no matter how good is NEVER revolutionary .  11. Love IS revolutionary  12. I'm not as smart as I thought  13. I can be smarter than I've ever imagined  14. I have issues. In particular I have abandonment issues, very very Good Will Hunting of me.  I have smart friends but mostly I have not so smart friends who will fuck you up at the very inkling of you messing with me.My mother didn't love me as a child so now I'm left with an overwhelming sense of paranoia and loneliness.

      I was in the middle of  writing a post-chappelle  frapper de retour ..............and then I got over it. Apologies to those interested in the convervsation but it was getting older by the minute, feel free to continue it on my tagboard or comments section.Provacative discussion is always a welcome sight here. The conversation became a  variation on an already tired theme and by the time I actually got to my response ,  the conversation had long moved on.    moving on.........    1. I just got up from finally finishing  Flowers for Algernon , only to realize that this was the most reading that  I'd done in a long time. It was the first time in a very long time that I'd been entrapped by a book. The book was great, insightful, sad, heartwarming and ...........sadly very close to home.  Or perhaps it's just my tendency to make everything relate.  It wasn't the book so much as the act of reading that made me realize how far gone I've been, how little time I'd given to myself and most importantly how out of touch I've been with my own humanity. Even though, I'm a writer I'm finding it incredibly difficult to express myself for fear of the repercussions of that honesty.    2. "Where'd you get those issues? That's Life"                   -Slug I've got a huge chip on my shoulder and it informs the way I view things, not out of  some paranoia that's come out of no where but out of an experience in which all those rules do/did apply. Sometimes those rules don't apply but it doesn't mean that they are there without reason.  I'm being cryptic, I know hence the lack of blogging. I'm going to stop now  *Written April 28th

        Continuing the Letter Writing Tradition, the Enviromentalist Returns ...........    1.  For May 2004 :  Youve done your penance by walking six feet behind a two-headed nimrod, and have eaten humble pie until your stomach hurt. Those times are so over, Leo  so buck up and stand tall.  Astro-Abby, you're more right than you could imagine. "sigh" I'm done with managing people and their egos. In the words of Rich,  it's time to blaze my own path.      2.  During the Initial stage of the struggle, the oppressed, instead of striving for liberation, tend themselves to become oppressors, or "sub-oppressors."  The very structure of their thought has been conditioned by the contradictions of the concrete,  existential situation by which  the were shaped. Their ideal is to be men; but for them , to be men is to be the oppressors.  This is their model for humanity.  -Paulo Freire  Pedagogy of the Oppressed    3.  Dear (_____),   not a sonnet not haiku not free verse This is a  letter saying all of the things I've wanted to.  All the things that I was afraid would jeapordize all that I cared about  Will the Truth set me free?     I can say this now because it's finally over. The past couple of months have been hard, as I've gone back and forth with myself I've been wondering whose fault it was. Who made what was once a intense and passionate relationship become something so fraught with bitterness wallows in the  muddy waters of disintegrated possibilities.  Maybe it was my fault.  I know, I DO  have a tendency to idealize, and I don't listen to the tiny voices in my head that say that this is  and has always has been kind of shady  I believed in you. I believed in us. I believed that together we could change more than minds, I believed that we could change the world. I believed in teaching love, peace and progress by sheer force of will.  Now I sit here humbled at the bigness of it all, of a future spent managing egos and insecurities I don't want to be stuck drowning in a puddle parading as a pond full of guppies who think that they're sharks    When my father told me that you were no good, that you would simply use me and  spit me out , I didn't listen. Late nights spent watching Def Poetry Jam with the volume turned low, I defended you I defended us I said that you were more than a passing fancy I believed that I could turn your faults into  strengths   "Hands pressed up against the plexiglass  and I saw who was fucking you and it was yourself"    And then I watched as your own ego consumed you and infected others. I saw how often the revolving door of your bedroom went round I saw how quickly you sold out I saw the booze I saw the smoke  Worst was how you infected the people you promised to protect. Where there was supposed to be a place that encouraged vision stood a place that feed on people's insecurities and their need to belong  you were something to aspire to Where you once pushed and inspired now you push down and you push away those with the conviction to offer an opinion different from yours those who see your flaws and choose to love you anyway  So I'm finally doing it. Finally saying goodbye Finally saying Fuck You Finally standing up for myself Finally saying how much I did love  you Finally saying how hurt I am Finally ready to move up and on   go on, brush your shoulders off  I'm finally lifting off that great big chip on my shoulder. I really need to. It's affecting my writing and worst of all my humanity. I don't recognize myself anymore.   "So when do you know it's finally over?"  "When it stops being worth it anymore"   To the Slam To the New York City Spoken Word Community  Diane  P.S. Oh and you can keep my poems

      It's 9.19 AM.........still in the computer lab since last nite  I started capturing the video around 8pm.....had dinner with my father at 1AM...we laughed at the  insanity of our existence over mashed potatoes  at French Roast.  Codine should only be saved for special occasions  I'm so done.....and this is supposed to be a happy moment and it's so quiet . No applause, no ballons, simply a Video tape  with more vulnerability on it then I'll ever show in my poetry.   I don't get to walk until next year but that's ok, because it'll give me a chance to plan a party a huge one! I'm done with undergad...and it only took 5 years........   Cheers to the next 5

      Last night for whatever reason, I started thinking about P=MV ( Power = Mass x Velocity)  of all the formulas that Mr. Anderes and Mr. Ganji made me  memorize this was on my brain. In my feeble logic I decided that the answer to all the worlds problems lay in P=MV   1) P= MV then 2) MP=V 3) PMV= 1?!?  No way? Makes no sense right? So then this light bulb goes off in my head and I think PMV = Inertia!   *(Please keep in mind that I haven't taken a Physics class since 1998)  So anyway, now I'm in the middle of writing this poem on Inertia and  and objects resistance to change and next thing I know  I'm waking up and it's morning  and P=MV is still bugging me so I blog. I come across  urlLink Oscar's  blog and see this.    TIPS ON READING POETRY  -read the poem in your own voice -do not guess the intent of the author -respect all commas, period, line breaks and stanza breaks  It was so easy to comprehend and simple and to the point.I laughed at myself because Id' been trying for months to try and nail explaining poetry deconstruction in a simple way. I laughed again and remembered just how important it is to have good  teachers in your life. Those people who have the patience to believe in you before you do, and the talent to break things down in a manner in which you  understood.   The old adage "Those can do  Those who can't teach" was more accurate than I would have liked in my school. We had a revolving door of bitter teachers, failures at their "real" professions, but there were always those teachers that really influenced you,and had a great impact on the kind of person that you'll become. Good teaching is difficult, and takes lots of work and planning, and trusting and sometimes teaching is really simple. Sometimes it's just about giving a shit about your students and listening to them, and making them important, because they know when you don't.  So I'm thinking, who has me up half the night thinking about P=MV?  He was the rogue of our district, a former military scientist, he  co-wrote a book with his wife about Ice. Yes, ice. This is what the  government studies.....ice and it's military capabilities....anyway... because he was schooled there, he had alot of knowledge in soo many different areas, like bio-med engineering, lasers, programming, electronics etc. So he teaches a program in one of the Magnet highschools called I&A (or Instrumentation and Automation)  First year (10th grade) We did introductory segments in bio-med engineering, physics, electronics, IC-board design and some other stuff  Second year (11th grade) I think we did like lasers/optics, and sound stuff (making/building/designing speakers), motors  3rd year  AP Calc /Indepedent Study  Umm yeah....this was high school and this guy was teaching stuff that College kids wouldn't get into until their Junior Year so how do I factor in?  Well after I had moved to Long Island I found that I had a knack for routinely getting into trouble.  I didn't smoke, do drugs, hang out, I was pretty much a hermit and I never went to parties and lived a pretty sheltered existence save for the reminders that everything in school was lies and that the Americans were brainwashing me.......ummm yeah moving on  but last part is sort of true. I grew up in a household that encouraged reading and above all questioning everything and not in some conspiracy theory way.... I just read alot but most importantly I read alot outside of school which prompted alot of curiosity in me which lead me to ask questions IN school... quite obviously the wrong ones  "Why isn't Egypt taught with the rest of Africa?" " But didn't Columbus kill all the Indians?" " If I pledge allegiance to the flag, does that mean   that I agree with everything that America does?"  and so on and so forth. If you don't know me well, I'm kinda hard headed. I can see now how/why these questions got on my teacher's nerves, but hey if I was a racist failed artist/writer/actor from middle class suburbia stuck in an all black school for little or no pay being asked questions I don't know the answers too........ I might be a little miffed too.  Now here's the next part that is true but you probably WON'T believe...... My social studies teacher had my paren'ts number on my speed dial I had been threatened with suspension twice for offenses including disrespecting a teacher ( I asked why the school felt the need to criminalize it's population with security guards) and destroying school property( Supposedly I had hacked into the computer labs computers and infected all of them with viruses. WHATever!?!?!)  Anyway I apply for Mr. Anderes program. I thought hey it's Math , I CAN'T really have an opinion therefore I can't get in trouble right?  I walk in and I'm floored. First thing he says is "If you want to learn you will, if you don't I wont force you to" "If you have a 90 average or above  you don't have to do homework if you don't want to Homework is there to help cement what you've learned  during the day. I won't give it unless you ask"  No Homework unless you asked? Are you kidding me?  but we did ask.......and often. Every night I'd get problems and I'd get my friends on the phone, We had study parties and  it was hard, but it was fun. I was never good at math but physics? I loved physics. It was creative , and had shapes, before  poetry there was physics.....  And this is what got me. Politics were never really discussed in class but it was there in methodology. There was no program like this  in the state and I'd be suprised to find one like it in the country. We had to have our own Regents written by (lol) our teacher, and our class comprised of the all the district rejects, the ones who had  trouble acclamating to regular school. AT least half of our 2nd year class had been diagnosed with some sort of disorder, be it ADD or depression, 4 of our guys with colorblind and then there was me the resident hacker culture theologist. I went to 2600 meetings listened to   urlLink Off the Hook  religously, , latest proggies, pushed to start a hacker training camp in order build an army that would free information everywhere.....ummm yeah this was before free code  So I stuck it out and it was fun and we worked together and we  made our brains were harder and stronger and I finally felt like I was on a team and I sucked at math but that was ok!  Later on I found out that there were meetings held about me. I was labeled "subversive" (They used those words) and that I should be watched carefully. My teacher told them where they could stick it.....  While folks like to blame problems in education on institutional stuff like funding, and class size there is also another culprit.... bad teachers... they affect really important stuff like tracking, who gets placed in advanced, regents and remedial classes. Like how do you know these things in kindergarten, or first grade? and the tracking system is designed so that once you get in the track it's really hard to get out. For example you may be good at everything but math so you get retracked in ALL of your subjects and if you catch up you STILL don't move up...  So long story short, we were invested in our own education and for the first time I felt like school was someplace to learn not some place to hide from the cliques and facist teachers. His teaching style influenced the kind of person I would want to become, the kind of teacher I myself would want to be and the kind of education that should be afforded to everyone  sooo........ I called him. I haven't spoken to Mr. Anderes in almost say..? 5/6 years? I can't remember but it's been a while and he remembered me! and we talked caught up and I tried explaining how this call came about, about  my confusion with P=MV, about how I was a writer now and how everyone in the rest of our class was doing. Cassa, Jon, Birdie and Justin went to MIT Cassa is in grad school at MIT Jon is a union organizer in Philly Birdie joined a frat and we lost track of him and Justin is in a Cal Tech Doctoral program in Chem or something?  and me? ummm....I'm a writer/spoken word artist? uhhhhh no  I'm graduating this year with a Degree in Cultural Studies and a Concentration in Anthropology. I want to study the politics of Space within the context of education and in short , what I believe to be the social engineering of the American Concious or lack thereof.......yeah and there's a video component to that. Maybe I'll be chilling with Michael Moore and make some big expose on  the similarities between schools and prisons..  I wanted to say this and I didn't....instead...for once... I said what I truly felt.....  Thanks Mr. Anderes. Thanks for teaching me to respect my brain and to feed it. Thanks for empowering us to learn instead of spoonfeeding/or drilling us. Thanks for believing that we could.Thanks for pushing us without being condescending. Thanks for giving us the space to find our own way and our own niches. Thanks for not being caught up in having to do it YOUR way. And thanks for remembering my voice after all these years :)   oh yeah...and when I called him he corrected me Power does NOT equal mass times velocity Momentum does..... duh?

      Last night several of my residents ran around in the rain with their shirts off, screaming at the angry heavens. I'm on the 10th floor and my residents were complaining. I've long learned to block out the New York City noise, it doesn't agree with me like it used to. It's too impersonal, the construction, the anonymous passerbys, not like Queens which has the sound of trees after 9pm or Brooklyn that has the sound of crack head scratching and Donna summers singing at 5AM.  They were screaming I wanted to as well.  I imagined me at 5 years old  midnite on the outskirts of Port Au Prince. I remembered my house, it was white and blue and there was mango tree in the front yard and I would always reach out on the balcony to try and get one. The mangoes were always to far away  At night, before breastes  before I was washed with wine I would dance with everyone else shirt-less and free , screaming and showering in the rain  I told them that they needed to stop. One of them looked at me  (I was like, oh yeah I'm the authority figure here) He said"Well if you WANT us to stop we will but we don't' HAVE to"   When you're screaming  at 1:30 in the morning like a maniac I don't have to be nice to you, but there is that part in me that's just a little envious and wishes that I had your  cajones   I wanted to get on top of the roof and tear my clothes off  and scream and smile and dance and explode, without analysis or explanation without responsibility  I did feel a little bit freer.  Publicly posting what I really felt about slam sliced a tiny chip of that shoulder of mine then passing up on a finals spot sliced another chip I was able to really enjoy it and as the night went on the more comfortable I felt with my decision. Contrary to popular belief  I never liked the competition, the pressure or even really being in front of people. The more I slammed the more nervous I got, not because of the points but I just never really enjoyed being on stage. I've always been way to self concious to ever like that many people staring at me. Big crowds, cool because I can't see anyone but even that got a bit much. This is why I get so defensive. I don't like motherfuckers looking at me. It bothers me. Stop. When I started it was easier, but as I grew to know the people around me who were listening, I subconcsiously began censoring myself  more and more. My real opinions and thoughts would slip out anyway, and we see where THAT's gotten me.  I couldn't be that vulnerable again. It hurt too much. I may not have gotten enough attention from my mother as a child but I didn't want to get that attention  here, from an audience.   Rather, with a nice boy, one on one, who makes me laugh and be naked while still clothed, who pulls the rug out from under me but then catches me whne I fall. It's no coincidence that I was dating **** when I first started slamming. He kept me sane and balanced and blocked out all the bullshit. Without him as my shield, I was now privy to all those things he tried to protect me from and I didn't like it.   Now I'm not even sure I enjoy reading my poems aloud. During semis it was Ray, Jai and Matt who kept me sane and I didn't want to go  through that again especially on a national stage. Slam no longer had anything to offer me as a writer and it was stifling not pushing me. Slamming during the season takes a lot out of me and slowly but surely I was getting really uncomfortable about the competition aspect. Shouldn't we be working together? Honestly, what did I want? I wanted to be on a team, to have me work want to be read and respected, I wanted to be pushed to my limits I wanted to have that camaraderie and to get really really drunk and silly with people I knew  and cared for.  I also realized that I could do that a lot easier without the competition.  Although I've had my personal gripes with 13 this was just me getting tired of/ growing out of the slam format in general  When I found out that I had a finals spot, my first instinct was to pull a Sean Randall and go up and freestyle all 5 rounds. I didn't give a hoot, but then I realized other people did, others who actually have something to give/gain to the slam, people who would appreciate and get out of it more than I could being in this scene so long.  .  Watching the team form, with Rich, mahogany , and Abena I became really happy. It was nice to see new blood. My favorite performance of the night was Jai's Calculus poem. I don't think I'd heard it before or at least not like this! It's an amazing poem,especially if you're a nerd. I loved it!.  It's amazing I've been called a lot of things Most of them inaccurate but a hypocrite is not one of them.  Ironically in order to be a hypocrite you have to  actually have had convictions to begin with.   *New Years Resolution #3,987    When you actually have the courage to have opinions, you will inevitably piss people off. Stop feeling bad about it, it comes with the territory

      I was expecting a drama free, care free summer but of course drama always finds malcontents  such as myself actually My dad put it more accurately  "When you are born free, you react violently when the yokes of slavery are put upon you" -Hans Roy   Yeah my dad rules!   Unfortunately I can't discuss the rant that is  just BURSTING out of me right now in detail.... all I'll say is that the  urlLink UAW  is involved. Though no one at work reads my blog.... YET  I'm sure more detailed accounts will follow.  Umm....Guy? Can I borrow Rules for Radicals when you're done?  *(Guy I went to thesaurus.com to look for another word, but no other one describes me as accurately as that one. We're simply going to  have to share)

      I just finished dvd-ing myself to death. Today was checkout and I was on duty from 2-6 getting all of the little freshman out of the dorms and back to where ever the hell the've come from. It's 1:46 in the morning and my doorbell just rang... AGAIN.... it's a good thing that i'm doing anything important like having sex.....jesus    Random Realizations....    1.  Watching Diane Keaton cry for 5 minutes straight is like overdosing laxatives.....the pain just won't stop.   2.  Keanu Reeves is fine.....and dare I say complex?  This is something no one would ever admit especially after  urlLink Bill and Ted's  oh so excellent adventure and/or Speed or his one dimensional character in The Matrix Trilogy, but the small roles that he's taken I like. Somethings Gotta Give My Own Private Idaho Dangerous Liasons  Ok so he's mostly played one dimensional dummies.....but  lately , especially after Matrix Revolutions...he's  grown on me...he's gotten funnier too....   I mean used to think that about  urlLink Brad Pitt . This was until  12 monkeys, Fight Club , Oceans 11 and of course  Interview with a Vampire. Now he's cited as being overly complex for the roles that  he plays. I don't know, but there's something sweet and sincere in his eyes. I loved his relationship with Diane Keaton in this movie and the way that it wrapped up with everyone ending up in their age approriate relationships really annoyed me. I just never believed that she would fall for a jackass like Nicholson's character leading me to    3.  Watching Jack Nicholson cry THAT much in a movie was just...... weird.  4. Amanda Peet is the not so annoying version of Jennifer Garner. I never liked her type (boring girl next door*see Katie Holmes) but she's alot more palatable than Ms. Garner and she (hopefully) wouldn't  be caught dead in the travesty  13 going on 30   5.Talking to Eliel online. He's the 6th person TODAY that has told me how great a movie  urlLink this  was and how funny and romantic it's supposed to be. It was annoying with some endearing parts. Honestly the highlight for me was when Julian (Keanu) comes in and they start playing  urlLink (oh adam)  Sunday Morning but then the fade out was totally out of sync  with the scene..... With a budget as big as this you'd think they'd get a decent sound editor with some rythm.... ok ...maybe I'm just hating.... maybe I've just gotten cynical... I'm sure the movie had some really deep uplifting meaning which quite frankly I'm not in the mood to see....of course I spent a long time hating Jerry Mcguire......  I thought that Rene Zellwegger's character was such a wallflower who defined herself by Tom Cruise's character.. I thought that she was so weak in her vulnerabilities I kept screaming at her to walk away....  then I watched my father.... he'd watch this movie once a week and cry and I'd watch it with him, on the couch  waiting for the money to come through to  make this divorce a possibility, to be able to put me  through school , my brother through school and get a second  mortgage. He's spent the last year and half on the couch and I've spent as many nights as I could there too.. I don't know when, but Rene's character started changing.. She wasn't the idiot love lorn loser who was infatuated with a self absorbed ego maniac........ she was in love and in that love she saw the man that he could be and accepted the man the he was. It gave her the strength to love him and the strength to leave him while still loving him because it wasn't just her who deserved more  THEY deserved more........but I wasn't going to see that was i? I just thought that my dad was an overemotional lush.... I used to call him a coward  and here he was in tears braver than I ever thought I could be... he laughed "it gets me everytime" I smiled..... went to my room silently and cried.....  I don't do that anymore.....  maybe I'll like THIS movie one day...

       This is not goodbye she said It is just time for me to rest my head She does not walk she runs instead Down these jagged streets and into my bed  -Maroon 5   urlLink Oh Adam , you're back in  my rotation again.....I need someone to soothe my bones   As I've cut off the last of loose strings, this upcoming summer won't be as scary as I initially thought it was going to be... At first it was filled with random thoughts like "SHIT!" what do I do  now? now I feel like Felicity right after she got over her initial crush on Ben.... free to live her life.... and up comes the dramatic music and she cut her hair (i'm not cutting it)   News/Updates   -My roommates have finally moved out and I feel so liberated. Unlike  urlLink Bass  I don't  believe in the sanctity of clothing....so this  is great. I won't be alone for to long but the next week or two will be great. I miss living alone. I got my first on my own apartment at 19 years old, and I had the room to be totally nuerotic/psychotic all  by myself without an audience.I forgot what living with people can do to a person like me who feels claustrophobic very quickly. If we're not married, I can't stand being around anyone that much, it's just annoying.  - urlLink Guy  you were right. I already have projects and possibly more school lined up for this summer. I can't help it....    -Eric is leaving and as much as I'll miss him ( I never spent enough time with him) I understand and applaud his need to  just get up and go. Sometimes you've just got to press ctrl-alt-del and see what life throws at you. It'll be interesting to see how relations shift, I know when I moved I got closer to  so many people i never thought I'd get closer to.....  - I miss my girlfriends...I'm making a point of spending more time with them. No boys allowed.   - Spent the past couple of days walkin around Union square and LES..... i love this weather  - I miss the mini-convos of my tagboard. I'm putting it back. I don't care how cluttered you think is. Comments actually require more substantial posting, which honestly I don't feel like doing in the summmer. I want to be OUTSIDE!!! I'm applying my substantiabilty (yeah so what it's not a word) elsewhere....like working on my tan  :)

       Zombie:  A being that behaves like us and may share our functional organization and even, perhaps, our neurophysiological makeup without conscious experiences  source*http://members.aol.com/lshauser/zomboid.html   1. The reason why zombies don't eat each other is simple. They are not cannibals, while it is commonly believed that they have some conciousness it is usually due to what we call in zombie circles "residual memory". This is the reason why in  urlLink Night of the Living Dead  and  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  Zombies returned to their homes and were drawn to people they knew. The process of zombie-fiction is akin to an eraser of conciousness which whittles someone's concious to the simply the some of their parts. This is why "brain-eating" is prevalent amongst zombies. Though all signs point to them being "dead-ish" there is that basic need to recapture that conciousness and to keep from from actually dying (becoming inanimate, with zero conciousness etc) Zombies are driven purely by biological instinct. Conciousness can only come from a fully concious human NOT another Zombie and THIS is why they don't eat each other.  2. In the Movie 28 days later, the zombie concioussness is distentegrated to one common denominator and that is pure and unadulterated RAGE. THESE zombies have inhabited the conciousness of the disease which they are infected with. The conciusness of a virus is like that of any other living creature and that instinct drives it to procreate, or in this case infect others. Now what isn't  believable in the movie 28 days later was how quickly this "disease" makes you "turn" or transform into zombie conciousness.  3. Zombie Movies, started by the great George A. Romero have always been political commentaries and satires. Because the zombie lacks conciousness, it is reduced to the role of a foil. It's a dramatic tool used to illuminate things about the main characters, those humans with conciusness with whom we the audience have a vested interest in. Because traditional zombies were slow, ghoulish, stupid, easy to kill, when the main characters died it was usually through some character flaw of their own or to illuminate something that Romero was trying to convey. In the original Night of the Living Dead, he was making a racial/moral commentary on Post-50's life in rural America and on our moral economy. In Dawn of the Dead he was discussion issues such as the morality of abortion, consumerism etc.  What makes a 28 days later a significant movie in the zombie genre is the fact that these zombies are rabid, they run : This means that blame shifts over to the zombie and not to you the concious human being.  Like Lord of the Flies, the film strips away the civility we all think we possess and demonstrates that we, too, are bound by the laws of the animal kingdom - it's survival of the fittest and to have a future we need to reproduce  any questions?

      I wake up earlier these days.....around 6:30 and not some hypo-maniacal 4:30 get three hours of sleep type thing..... Now that I'm not spending my extra time and money  out, I'm doing what I've been wanting to focus on....my writing... in a general sense, not neccessarily poetry  either. It's amazing what sleeping can do for your general tempepermant Oh don't worry I've still got my issues!   1. I took my Atmosphere CD out of my drawer and I don't  want to listen to it, afraid of indulging in my dark fantasies   2. Worked out for the first time in months. It's been hard to find a regular routine, with all the moving, the injury, the changes. Today is Thursday, day four of normal living again. I haven't had this much space in, well I can't remember....  This workout is the pre-workout for before I start back up in the gym again. Seeing how badly out of shape I've gotten my sifu will punish me. I hope he doesn't kill me. I was never really into stair climbing and treadmills..... I've always needed something more interesting, like boxing. It works everything and it really pushes your limits emotionally and phsyically.   I'm a survivor, I'm not g'on give up    Lactic acid is the electric guitar to the symphony of rhythms raging rope beating linolieum heart crushing against a ribcage straining past a shirt that was too small two years go  tears and sweat sprinkled over clenched teeth seasoning taught lips with the taste of last nights ravioli  Think only in  calories and kilojules speak only in the language of BMI ....    whatever I'm not finishing this one        .

      The past two days have been such a blur..... Thank god I went to G.A. with Sal and Guy on Saturday. Poor Guy lost his glasses on Nitro and he was blind as a bat. We kept losing him and he'd walk around with this lost look on  his face and you'd think he was looking right at you when in reality he was just trying to to recognize the colors everyone was wearing cause I don't think that he could really recognize our faces.  1. Salome is one tough woman!Like I thought I was fearless but nooooooo......Woman had a plan and by 1pm we had gotten on like 4-5 rides (we rode batman twice). Now that's FOCUS! most people just mosey on along and you end up on two hour lines. We did that for ONE ride (SUperman) which was totally not worth out , however I got to see  scantily clad, skanky girls in various degrees of inappropriate attire down to just rank nudity.  urlLink You missed out   2.I hate New School University Housing and I don't care if this shows up on  any google searches. They are EVIL, EVIL , EVIL!! You think you know..........but you have no idea. Yeah sure I get a free room........in exchange for my SOUL!! This rant will get more detailed in due time folks in due time...  3. I finally changed rooms. They moved me into a smaller suite. For now I have it to myself and that's nice. I can live like a human being again, I can play my music really loud, run around naked screaming, do dishes when ever I FEEL like doing them and not have to wallow in the nastiness of others. I was built to live alone. I need that space to be manic and crazy and stupid...... I grew up in a one bedroom apartment with two crazy parents and one loud little brother who I shared a bed with....you can imagine just how much peace and quiet are luxuries that I will never tire of ...   4. I'm really exhausted. I was checking people in at like 2aM. I fell asleep in the office around 4 am and woke up at 8 to finish moving stuff and then there's training this whole week. It's not the work that bothers me it's just not ever telling me about it until last minute. I missed my best friend's graduation and I doubt she's even speaking to me at this moment.  5. The real reason that I decided to post.  Every couple days I check my referrals on Site meter and there are some funnny ones and I always get slightly paranoid when I see just how many google searches that there are for my name. The usual suspects who I'd expect to search me know where to find me which leaves Unusual suspects and honestly, I don't go out enough to have anyone searching for my ass.........save for  my dad...but that's a whole other post... anyway so I'm looking through the google searches mostly my name Dave chappelle or a search for someone on my links section but this tops all of the weird google searches EVER  drum roll please..........    diane roy diane OR para OR paraplegic OR wheelch   WHAT? who's out to get me......then I realized it was the OTHER Diane Roy from France, the cyclist......  yeah....

      I got a phone call!  1.yes!! a therapist finally called me back! When looking through an HMO or PPO? (I still don't know the difference). And now that I'm (ahem) "taken" now all the other ones I called are calling me as well. lol.... One thing about calling therapists is that they NEVER answer their phones REALLY!! they don't! Anyway step one is admitting you have a problem  2. I started listening to Morrissey and the Cure. I went home last weekend and dusted off my  Elliot Smith and Eels CD's. I haven't listened to those since my days at Fredonia. Don't worry, I'm just getting in touch with my inner white girl. If I start listening to Tori Amos, please somebody just SHOOT ME! I'm serious...... I've seen Tori fans.... a) they only refer to her as Tori not Tori Amos b) no one is a casual Tori listener, they are tori followers c) I'm always afraid that if I ever listened to her words    (or even understood her words if i listened) that some kind   of caucasian voodoo spell would be put on me........  Anyway moving on.....Morrissey and the Cure will be making their way into my collection. I've never actually listened to a whole Morrissey or Cure CD so If you don't hear from me on Monday you  can know that I killed myself to THIS song  "You shut your mouth how can you say, I go about things the wrong way, I am human and I need to be loved, just like everybody else does"   aww come on....you know you love it. At least I haven't lost my sense of humor :)lol  3. Speaking of funny...Looking for a therapist is one of the most hilarious things I've EVER been through. I get to look for someone to talk to based on gender/ethnicity and the funniest of all SPECIALTY!   Press one for hypnosis Press two for behavior modification Press three for suppressed meglomania Press four for sexual dysfunction Press five for Adult Therapy   etc....etc.....etc.... If I knew what was wrong with me, why would I be here?  So I get literally hundreds of hits because I hit NO PREFERENCE for just about everything so I figured maybe I'd do it by Ethnicity. I wanted a non-biased opinion on things so I figured I'd click on Native American. I want a Native American Pyschologist. I mean who can understand pain MORE than the Native American...  click  none  !No clinicians were found with the information you provided!   there are none! what a surprise So then I clicked on Laotian, then Vietnamese, I even tried to get one from Latvia! no luck.   4.now that I'm openly depressed I think I should go into comedy. I got a call to slam at the Nuyo on Friday. It was like getting a call for break up mercy sex and actually considering it for two  seconds. For about a second you forget what was wrong enough to  make you break up in the first place and you think that it wouldn't be a bad idea. Long story short I didn't go, but comedy is my next thing ;) he he he he...... I'll be like Dat Van on  Last Comics Standing  which I must say is a hilarious show which they only show in marathon sequence on Comedy Central. It's a reality show with somewhat quasi intelligent people who are really witty thus mean to each other on a WHOLE other level.  Imagine having these people be the cool kids at YOUR school? How could anyone stand a chance at having a witty comeback towards THEM!! I shiver at the thought These people are so fucked up.......... and no it doesn't make me feel better :)  4. I ran into my ex boyfriend. yes THE ex...the first boyfriend who SHOULD have given me all my issues, but who I have a surprisingly healthy  relationship with....I was coined ex-girlfriend of the year by one. Sadly enoug I'm serious. In hindsight I have great relationships almost all of my exes. Sees, I'm quite the picky one really really  really picky. I'm not an easy person to get to know, much less deal with , much less love and underneath it all lies a very different very soft very loving obsessively devoted person.  My philosophy is that I loved you for a reason... and at the time it was a good one. Usually it was that I was so engrossed in the man you'd become that I was strong enough to forgive the man you WERE.  ummm bad relationship perspective but if it's real then given enough time and distance it should be salvagable. I'm chronically forgiving.    *mental note: discuss this right after revealing mommy issues   Anyway, I saw him with who I assume is his new girlfriend. Two years ago, I thought that if I saw this  I'd die.  You know this feeling, when you are convinced that seeing something like that can kill you. I  believe that it can, or at least make you pass out as you're crossing the street only to get pummeled by a Mack Truck  I've never fallen in love, I've tripped and ended up in some hyper obssessive, intense, passionate trysts but HIM who will go by M (thank god he's computer illiterate), no matter how bad it got, was ultimately good and most importantly he was good to me. No matter WHAT we were able to talk, and as much as I wanted to hate him for breaking my heart (and believe me I  did) what was cool was how diligently he needed to make me understand that he loved me and what we had no matter how much I wanted to erase it was real  This was a concept which was alien, and foreign to my fragile 19 yr old heart Anyway.....we laughed (ok I laughed, he was nervous) but it was ok. I was ok.  sooo.....ok

       le remix   Wednesday morning  rain is falling steal some covers share some skin  back and forth  we sway like branches in a storm change the weather still together when it hends   but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do and I would gladly hit the road get up and go if i knew that someday it would lead me back to you that may be all I need........   Goals for the Next 5 years?  1. GET IN THERAPY AND STAY THERE!   no more of this dillydallying shit.  No I'm fucked up and I hurt and I want it to stop. Period. I'm sick of the cold sweats, the panick attacks I want to erase the constant lump in my throat. I look at pictures from the last 10 years. I don't smile There's a naseous feeling in the morning  when I realize that another day is starting: and there's nothing  I can do about that.  This isn't grief. How can I have lost something I never had?  It's another day and it seems like it's never going to end. You're just trying to get through the next hour trying to smile joke be sarcastic do your work don't complain and for chrissake if you tell me how angry I am again Don't give me that look the one that says "you're too smart for this" I can't reason my way out of depression  believe me I've tried  If there was anyone who would create  urlLink a theory of everything  simply to make herself feel better it would be me.  Don't tell me how I feel Don't presume to know me because you don't so stop   "And who's fault is that?"    You know somethings wrong when you start covering it up... you start having to pretend happiness   There's always that one person the one  that can always see right through you into your bones and under your skin and straight into the ugly you're so desperately trying to cover up with  jokes cut sharp and narrow the laughs with the undercurrent of disgust  I hate that person for seeing this and not loving me anyway.  I can't remember the last time I was honest  on this blog in my poems face to face  I can't remember the last time what was in my heart was accurately translated  instead I get this kneejerk reaction the one with the witty one liners lathered in turpitude  where my insecurities pour out like bile punishment for all the things I'm waiting for you to do to me and you will do them to me   I walk around and my world is like the Matrix  everyone still "plugged" still is a  potential  enemy. One thatat any moment can turn into an agent that will hunt me down.  feel breathe on my back  so no........I don't sleep.  I pass out and then the nightmares start and when my brain processes memory it' doesn't know the diffrence  Does it matter if a memory is real or not? because I have them and real or not they map out  the woman I am....  so then I wake up in the morning..... it takes me a couple of minutes to digest what I've spent the last couple of hours experiencing then I give myself the talk that good or bad it's not real it's not real it's not real  then I feel the knot in my stomache as I quickly calculate how many hours  are left, how many hours I can stay up before I pass out again.........   V.O. (Voice Over)  At least Charlie had Algernon

      ok........so I have nothing that I WANT to share so instead i'm going to watch the MTV movie awards and write this AS I watch...  1. Just walked in to Lindsay Lohan "serving" her parents (*Note: I OWN the dvd). I know that there will be various posts regarding her invariable "hotness", I know I might be hating but I just don't care, however THIS was said  and it encompassed how I felt  Diane: did you see the lindsay lohan dance? Bassey7: Yeah Bassey7: She wasn't awful Bassey7: She dropped it as though it were hot  I concur.....  2. There is a midget dressed up as a gremlin IN the awards podium. Why do I feel like SOMEONE should be offended by that? and NO I don't have a sense of humor  3.Ok the animation for the Best Kiss Award included a mortician or doctor whatever kissing a corpse ........ok kissing corpses is cool but a tittie on t.v. isn't.......hmmmm yeah   Random note...   what the HELL is a Net Carb anyway?

      It's back. The knot in your stomache when you wake up knowing that another day is starting and you live life in hours.... this is just sad....  I've been doing some really, REALLY interesting character work lately, going back to writing short fiction and revisiting some of my old work.  Important thing is to keep writing, no matter  WHAT the genre....writers write period. I know that for myself I can't consistently write in ONE genre for very long before it burns me out...... I need space to stretch my legs If you're interested I'm going to start posting them on my other blog....  urlLink Getting Glassy   2.  In Other News  June  is full of fun and interesting ways to distract myself from well......myself First off!  urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  comes out this Friday June 11th! unfortunately I'll working on Friday......  Then There's the  urlLink Nip/Tuck   Season Premiere June 22nd Last season's finale was RIDICULOUS!

       A J-Lo Intervention     LONDON (Reuters) - British bookmakers offered  odds of 3-1 Monday that singer/actress Jennifer Lopez and her new husband  Marc Anthony would divorce by the end of the year   Those who never quite accepted that Lopez and Affleck  had split for good after one of Hollywood's most tumultuous  romances also have a chance to bet.    The bookmakers are offering 14-1 odds that Affleck and  Lopez are married by the end of 2004    An Open Letter  Jen, Sweetie, I know that that you're most likely NOT reading this. Right now you and Marc are somewhere being blissfully happy, ignoring the media and all of the speculation around you. I'm sure that you're out being "dripped" in diamonds. Oh sure, you're still Jenny from the block  Is NOTHING sacred to you?  So tell me Jen, ARE you happy? Really? You sound like you need a friend.  Or a swift kick in your not so voluptous ass  "She's short/ her ass is wide/ it's an optical illusion"   Maybe you and Britney should go into group therapy together. Maybe she can talk you into becoming a resanctified virgin with her, maybe you can give her some fashion tips. Sisters need to stick together! I know that it must be hard dating, but marriage is NOT a coping mechanism for a broken heart. You don't marry the rebound, especially not if it's Marc Anthony! come on!  Those kinds of mistakes are for stupid 20 year olds not seasoned 31-year old women! At your age you shouldn't even need a rebound! That's just childish and above all weak! Read a book or something! Go Camping! Stop seeing your spiritualist and get therapy!  take a breather try to be alone for a second! Close your legs for two!   Try standing on your own two feet for a little while... learn to love J. Lo for J.Lo Have some serius J. Lo time...... take a warm bath spend the afternoon masterbating and loving J-Lo take some advice from Beyonce......... or Mary J...... or Tina Turner......  YES! take a note from Tina! Stop getting MARRIED!  I have only one advice to give you: Why don't you retire while you can still pretend that you are on top?  Greta Garbo had one flop and retired from acting. You have had many and you are still hanging on. I wonder if that should be interpreted as courage or stubbornness. You will say that you have to please your fans, and I have no doubt that there are several J.Lo fans out there. But there have been concerns that your latest behaviour -- including this marriage thing -- has demonstrated once and for all that you have lost touch with your fans. I have tried to offer solutions above, but I am certain that the situation can only worsen over time. You are but a fad in a series of fads in a society with an attention span long enough for a fifteen-second commercial. Your popularity has decreased in recent years, but why do you first have to through a Carey-esque "Glitter" to realize it?  I wish this was more biting but I feel for you J-Lo really I do.    2.  And In Other News....  Reagan Died. About Damned time. I'm glad.I hate his tired alzheimer's ass.There I said it. You can start tapping my phones again  3. They say taupe is very soothing.....

      1.I am up this morning working in the office  on Check out. This means that for each person that comes downstairs I  have to go up, make sure that the room is still intact, check for damages THEN get their key. Thats what I say, but for my *cou-Boss-gh*, it REALLY means finding any and all means to catch them and charge them on the way out. I willfully do not partake. My days are numbered here.  I'm kidding this job isn't that bad, I'm just a bougie lazy, wannbe writer  I'm just mad because I was having this AMAZING dream about vin diesel and I had to wake up........*sigh....oh vin....  anyway more about the amazing,caring, loving vin later........... and his big strong arms  shake it off diane   I've made some decisions as of late. Here they are  1. I'm officially celibate 2. In the next five years I will go out on a date with Adrien Brody, Vin Diesel,and the keyboardist from Maroon 5 ........not neccessarily in that order but most possibly at the same time.... 3. I will move out of nyc 4. I will almost certainly move back 5. I will stop running into my exboyfriends    on the train at 2:30 AM 6. They (my exes) shall here to for stop getting cuter!   back to vin gazing

      1. Does the asshole ever write the poem?  (in response to a conversation about how poets always place themselves in the role of victim)  2.I just saw SuperSize Me....... Now mind you my mother was/IS a militant vegan in the sense that I got  beat when I was caught with kitkats in my pocket (and you WONDER why my ass needs therapy). I got forcefed "Diet for A New America" my mom was friends with John Robbins and she lived on the fringe of radical food politics..... and I hated it. I never had a choice in the matter so when I got older and moved to buffalo one of the million ways I chose to piss off my mom was through bad eating...(a whole other post) bottom line, it's really hard to gross me out and if you have the nerve to tell me what to eat I will ream you another asshole....I've spent my whole life dealing with my self image in the wake of an obssessive person who tried to force something good for me  down my throat in a bad way. This said... I never want to eat at McDonalds again and I've decided to make diligent effort to cut SHIT out of my diet. PERIOD. Ideally I'd want to be a raw foodist (nothing cooked) How easy will that be? not very? Food is a drug and I'm addicted, how am I going to do this? I don't know but watching this guy and what he went through especially the physiolgical and psychological strain food put him through gave me several epiphanies... I'll keep those to myself... but yeah...go see it. It was McGood...

      1.Bernie Mac's wife on his show is very, very pretty. One day I'd like to get a weave just like hers :)  2.I'm coming out of the closet now. I'm a poker player. It's a vice,but one much healthier than some others and I've been meeting tons of cool new people which is cool. If you think it's a game of luck then you're playing the wrong game but that's a whole other post. For right now I'll just do a brief write up of last night.   Last night's poker game was actually pretty good. Only thing was that I got there really late, so I didn't have time to get my money back. I didn't get out of work till 9 so by the time I got home it was almost 11. I called up  urlLink Pauly  to see if the game was still going on and it was so I zipped uptown and got cracking.   When I got there it was such a rush. I think I become my true self when I play. Normally I'm so busy being self conciuos that I just retreat into my shell...here? I become the badass I've always dreamed of being. It's like having an alter ego.  Question:If you had a superpower, what would it be?  I kept getting sucked into games of Anaconda. This is a hi/lo game where the people with the high or the low split the pot. This was a concept that was still a little fuzzy to me because EVERYONE was at least representing a full boat. People who won this game usually did so with quads or straight flushes.  Question was whose boat would beat who's.  I just learned the rules that night so I didn't really get a good idea of when I had a good hand or not. The thing about Ananconda is that the pots get  HUGE, I mean REALLY HUGE really quickly.It's a tough game to walk away and it's really easy to lose alot of money.  and i did.  I laid down some strong hands. I think some of my strenghts are that I don't have any obvious tells, I have really good intution and because it's simply a game, I can get into certain roles so much quicker. (Speaking of which a D&D blog will follow) I know when you've got it, when you've don't and who I can push around. Sometimes I lapse and I don't listen to myself. It happens to us all. Also being a girl, I don't have the same ego as some of the guys do so when I'm took I'll fold. It helps me play a much tighter game.  But this happened in this game of Anaconda where it was heads up between me and  urlLink Ferrari  Now you may not know anything about poker but let me explain the situation. I just started playing poker and all of the practice I've gotten has come from playing with  urlLink M.C.S.  which was moot because there's no bluffing there at all. I usually play poker online. To my left is Charlie who from what I got makes his living playing poker  urlLink Pauly  who makes his  living playing poker part-time....and Ferrari who hosts this weekly game. Basically I'm at a table of semi-pros and/or Ivy league, wall street guys with lots of money to lose.You can see how it can get intimidating. The poker players I'm afraid of most are the nerds, because when they get into something they get into it all the way. These are the card counters, the guys who read the poker books, who systematically look for tells and then break them down.....like crazy shit.  Example:    Playing a round of Ananconda   Pauly: Do you think I've got the nuts? Ferrari: Please! I know what YOU'RE holding! Pauly: What are you the amazing Kreskin?  Diane: *(To herself)  Yeah he passed you those 8's on 4th street   Ferrari: I passed you those 8's on 4th street  Thing is I intuit whether you've got it or not, I get the feeling that Ferrari memorizes hands and shit. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a poker mathematician. I'm a little slow on the uptake so when I'm in a hand he's the guy I'm always worried about,  the only reason I'd end up heads up with him is because as tight a player as he is, I can read him like a book and he usually just has me out drawn. For example in this one hand, I knew his four 3's would beat my boat 6's over K's. I knew that he had quads when he turned over his pair of threes. I knew that he was checking from a position of strenght not weakness. Though there were other hands at the table that had me bought I know I could push them out. (I hope they're not reading this lol...) but those 3's were taunting me. My boat was taunting me. In a round of Hold 'Em a full boat is a betting hand! but in Ananconda this is not so. I could SEE the 3 and I bet anyway...... I was already too invested. Lo and behold it turned over and my stomache dropped.....    I was down to $17 bucks at one point but I grinded my way back up winning a couple small pots including an all-in for 1.50 when  urlLink Asphnxma  was about to leave.   Like I said before... it was a good game. I needed to play. If  you want another wrap up go  urlLink here

      i lost 3 lbs , i went out and got a tan,  i had some cds stolen and i didn't kill anyone  today was a good day  This is an open letter to the woman I will eventually become. The one who is as strong as she is percieved to be The one who like Nike says, Just does it.  This woman won't write letters to herself in the future tense This woman will go to parties and wear Manolo Blahniks and smile constantly she'll take pictures, lots of them She'll write things that are happy.... She won't laugh in embarassment when they aren't She'll sit in quiet solitude.... in the park and barnes and noble she'll smile more she'll start going to  Acentos  regularly...... she'll exist in the greys between all or nothing instead of jumping from either/or  She'll smile more She willl read religiously and accept people for who they are Not who she wants them to be She'll got Acentos more.....  She'll finally write  urlLink Rich  the e-mail she's been working on for days. The one where she breezily mentions that she reads his blog all the time. She tells him that how  impressed she's been with his work and how much she's been enjoying watching the man that he's growing into.  She'd tell  urlLink Oscar , how much she wishes they were friends and she'd stop being too mad to be the patient one.......  She'd stop jocking  urlLink Guy  so much ;)  She'd play poker more regularly. It teaches her that win/lose playing  teaches you alot.  She'd Thank urlLink  Eliel  for checking up on her  She'd tell  urlLink Juan Diaz  that he's cool and that she reads his blog. She'd tell him that leaving school was probably the best decision he ever made. She'd keep her mouth shut about Iraq   She'd admit that she too needs friends.  She'd post this blog and not be embarrassed by it. She'd stop writing about herself in the third person  I wonder what she'll think reading this years from now. Will she think I'm pathetic? weak? entirely to vulnerable? Will she be laughing at how hard it is for me to access myself face to face? Will she see how childish and cowardly it is to need to see yourself through an intermediary afraid to take responsibility and to define  yourself and accept responsibility for those decisions....  I'm sure she'll laugh and understand and simply..........  smile more.

      I spent today watching very fucked up movies.... I started off with  Se7en  which I hadn't seen in a while... A  Perfect Murder  (Gwenyth again) followed by  Trainspotting  which I had never watched from beginning to end (sober) only to end with an oldie but a goodie....  FightClub  So now I feel like planning a murder, and getting some insurance money,beating the crap out of my coworkers in order to  free them from their enslaved existence and try heroin........... yeah ummm cabin fever much?  I needed a day of vegging out, I was working all weekend. Serving rich  people at country clubs makes me want to piss in the lobster bisque..... Watching them dance like they are having full body spasms makes me want to shit in the beef wellington  but I would NEVER do that...[insert evil laugh] Anyway the point of this post was to highlight all of the cool movies/shows coming out for this summer. If you don't know, I love all movies, good/bad. I love bad movies [i.e. You got Served] but it helps me appreciate the good ones and there's alot to learn from the bad ones.   Any these are only SOME of my recommended picks...   T.V. Shows     June 13th   urlLink Six Feet Under  If you haven't seen this show, you should. I don't have HBO but hopefully I can catch the repeats when I visit my folks.   June 22nd!   urlLink Nip/Tuck  Season II begins for   Let's have a botox party!    urlLink  [Movies- the USUAL suspects]     urlLink Shrek2  I have  yet to see the first Shrek movie but I have to admit, I do have a bias against animated flicks. Unless you rent it and FORCE me to go watch it with you, I won't do it. I might enjoy it while it's happening but never under my own volition. Shrek 2 has gotten amazing reviews though so I'll shed my old school close minded ways and try this....   urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  Perhaps the most anticipated movie for this summer. I love Vin. Vin you are so hot, so so hot, because you are so deep.....so so deep......  I wanted to do unemtionable things to you in Boiler Room and the pre-Chronicles interviews on the Sci-Fi channel let me get to know the REAL you ......yummm.... You're such a bad ass....   urlLink The Stepford Wives.  The first one edged on the side of horror, this one on Comedy. I'd like to see how they shoot it, it just looks interesting. Date movie material?? hmmm?   urlLink Mean Girls  Ok I already saw this one but it made the list anyway just because all fans of Tina Fay should go see it. It's funnier then I had expected however now I understand that it's also Lindsay Lohan trying to get her hip hop  cred playing a transfer student from Africa...whatever see the movie....    Some more UNusual Picks    urlLink Napoleon Dynamite  I saw a free screening of this a while back and it was HILARIOUS. I won't say more..go     urlLink City of God  If you're one of the cavepeople who STILL haven't  seen this movie, it's still playing at the  urlLink CC Village Cinema on 12th see it if you haven't. It's been playing for almost a year and a half... that says a lot. In my top 5 all time best made films it's easily in the top two and that's saying alot.... American Beauty barely made top 15...    urlLink Goodbye Lenin  This one seems interesting. It's been playing at the Angelika for a while.     When his mother, a steadfast Communist, has a heart attack and falls into a coma while watching him being arrested during a protest in Berlin in 1989, a young East German man becomes concerned that when she wakes up, the excitement of the fall of the Berlin Wall may be too much for her.....     urlLink  Carandiru   I'm not sure but it's coming out of a wave of movies from Brazil *see City of God.  tells the stories of prisoners in Brazil's Sao Paulo House of Detention, one of the largest prisons in Latin America (housing 7,800 men in a facility designed for 3,000), leading up to the massive October, 1992 "Pavillion 9" riot/massacre which led to the deaths of 111 unarmed inmates.     urlLink Bukowski: Born into This  Now there's quite a good chance that this could seriusly suck. There are no reviews and I haven't heard about it from anyone. Not only that, I've never seen great documentaries on famous people. It's as if the filmmaker thinks the famousnness relinquishes any need to make the story interesting...I'll try it anyway...   urlLink Imelda  Playing at the Film forum till  June 22nd.  Seems fun   Wednesday, June 30   urlLink The Corporation  Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, No Logo author Naomi Klein and Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman take on the multi-national corporation, with wit and erudition. Without an elected head of state or allegiance to a particular nation, language or culture - the corporation is an institution of enormous power and influence that, in the words of this compulsively watchable, surprisingly entertaining movie, creates great wealth, but causes enormous and often hidden harms. Co-directed by Mark Achbar (MANUFACTURING CONSENT: NOAM CHOMSKY AND THE MEDIA), and based on Joel Bakans The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, the film analyzes the curious history, inner workings and controversial impact of corporations upon world affairs, the environment, the gap between the worlds rich and its poor and the privatization of natural resources   A definite must see. Little known tidbit is that Zinn is also a playwright...  June 25th!  urlLink Farenheight 9/11  on the more political tip,Michael Moore does it again. Suspiciously so I can't find showtimes on Yahoo Movies.... hmmm coincidence? I think not!   There are TONs of movies that I have missed Feel free to add to the list  Hope you enjoy my picks!

Wednesday, June 23   Seriously Folks    after reading  urlLink Fish's  blog   Diane: i mean do i LOOK like a girl who would want it up the ass?  Friend: BWAHAHAHA  Friend: I dunno. maybe its a Hatian thing.     Tuesday, June 22   Quizzical Quirks  1. Little John is embarassing and funny at the same time  I think that he's secretly a well spoken sociopath  who's laughing at everyone who laughs at him   2. I listen to William Hung's CD   3. Good News:I'm on a speedrace to hit bottom  Bad News: I'm not going to crack any time soon      **************************** So seriously folks, quit asking me to post more often or your going to get THIS kind of random unadulterated shit :)  From the horses mouth  without a filter in it....

      I have so much to say, and so little inclination to say it...... I've just stopped caring period being witty has just stopped being that important I explain myself out of guilt.... just don't touch me right now..   In Happier News   I'm only temporarily not broke. I'll be broke again ina  couple of days when after I pay some bills. I get ridiculously generous when I get paid. Just ask the people I bought drinks for last night.... I need to buy some books....something to read for pleasure any suggestions?

                 Vin-Servations....  1. He looks like at least TWO of my exes 2. ......morphed together 3. For all of you now emasculated Y chromosomes   believe me when I say it's not the muscles   And it's not like the time when I said size didn't    matter. I really mean it this time....it's the charisma   How can you look into those eyes and NOT be in love   They just make you want to build defense mechanisms for   him to save you from.....    4. Until him, I had the same obssesive crush on   Bruce Lee. I used to fantasize about me and bruce.   I've loved him since I was 8 years old.   Some dudes are just cool.....like it's in their swagger cool.... 5.I LIKE maroon5.... I lust Vin Diesel 6. I could go on about Vin all night......   but I won't....just sigh and stare.....

      Imagine your alarm clock a symphony Heralding tommorrows Laced in single digit Sizes Pat your belly and compare how flat It is since yesterday Dont get out of bed Until youve decided what you will eat  your tongue isnt worn yet By a life of  Sodas and And cigarettes  Justify smoking Promise that when life starts Getting better Youll stop   Secretly hope that they make a patch For your addiction to insanity  Slowly increasing Your dosage of soma And sobriety  turn to your side and realize  that your stomach isnt really flat at all  the sun has changed colors 6 times already  Dont look at your alarm clock  your pillows sound like Barry White  dont leave me baby baby  baby please.  Hug them  feel warm And perfect  The grooves in your ceiling Have  become urban constellations. In them you see rivers And veins you find Tolkiens Inspiration for the map of middle earth.  You can keep track of your movement In how many times you need to Roll over to  Answer the phone Grab a book   Right now is the reason You got the wireless keyboard and mouse set    A rested mind Is borne out of relinquished hope  Counting hours like days  Measuring success in failed  Suicide attempts   Ignore the  Hum of the t.v. And aspire to be too proud To pick up a phone  Remind yourself that hard work Is happening    Crave hugs like methadone  And then relapse  Into tears And fear  then kill something beautiful  Beg  for laughing prescriptions  Get through The next second The next minute  each day gets easier And asking for help is a step back  laugh at silly questions like   What did you do today?   invested in a life worth saving  And  this as busy as it  gets

      What is that moment when you wake up and you realize you've turned into your mother?   Mine happened yesterday around 2:42 p.m. I sent a very ill timed text message and then slapped my forehead *DOH* now i'm a smart girl. I know better but sometimes? well..... I get impulsive. I pressed send and two seconds later I realized that I had made a horrible mistake.   Something my mom would do. Oh QUEEN of zero self control...  I thought I bit this in the butt with my super high g.p.a. I thought i could reason my way out of an insanity that plagued 9 aunts.. my half sister and my cousin....    After a huge fight with my dad that would include the dessimation of some furniture or wall, or throwing the next day she'd be totally sweet as if nothing had happened as if this kind of behavior was acceptable.  it drove my dad insane....he'd still be simmering needing his space and she'd act like she wasn't trying to kill him the night before   It's pretty awful, especially when you hate her.... What? oh yeah...I have a mother yes...my parents are still married. yes ....they live in the same house but SHE is dead to me that fucking bitch.... and guess what? ............  The impulse to think that everything was ok just because everything was ok with me took over. As if it's ok to fight and make up like nothing ever happened. I've been finding other clues..... such as the names i've been called  selfish,manipulative, self absorbed... this is scary people. I've spent my whole life trying not to be like this woman   I'm the poster child for abortion  I carry guilt for never being enough I blame myself for shit that's not my fucking fault   "breathing sweet you'll never be anything's down her back"  -McS   Happy Mothers Day Bitch

      your sweet stains still bitter  my tongue laughs at how stupid i was smiles at the girl too scared naive to stare at a mirror which reflects salvation in the image of  strong jawlines 5 o'clock shadows and chest hair  She will find salvation in the image of dark skin tainted breasts sees too clearly the lining of the collarbone as it protrudes out shoulders back  now she laughs when SHE thinks it's funny fills her own voids and moves innards around to make new ones for you

      ARGHH! My original birthday post  was all about me feeling old and unaccomplished  but A)considering that most people I deal with are at least 25 and over, I decided against it and I would elicit ZERO sympathy  B)fuck that! I've done alot so far and I'm happy... I've lived most of my life on over drive, in this mad dash to get to the next benchmark.... to hit bottom to break even and I don't want to anymore....It's not so much that I feel old, just that I feel my twenties going and going really fast.....    You're decisions start changing You get more patient you get less tolerant  And there's this push to live and live  slower.........   soo..  I'll keep this short My birthday is July 29th   If you wanna get me something here's my list  1. a macintosh with FinalCut Pro 2.an ipod 3. theatre tickets 4. Gift Certificates to the following are also acceptable   a. Barnes & Noble   b. Amazon.com   C. Babes in Toyland   d. The Gap 5. Books are always endearing :)It's interesting to see what    people (especially older more experienced people) think I should read.    You can't grow in a vaccum. 6. Dinner is always good. I'm always hungry and I'm always broke 7. Same applies for alchohol. I'm always broke and always drunk :) 8. Flowers work.Pretty ones. I used to get them for my apartment all the time.    It made everything so alive.. 9. Plants work even better :) (I'm particular to basil,oregeno , sage and....)    yeah you get the idea ;) 10. Vin Diesel...in a dark room. If you know him...or know someone who does..     hook a sister up!  11. While you're at it....remember i DID mention a gift certificate to babes in toyland   Or maybe I'll celebrate my birthday hobbit style and give presents to my friends....  I'll sleep on THAT one.    Part II  I talked to Eric the night before. He's fully moving in to his apartment this weekend and from what he's told me He's got an amazing two bed room with a view of a mountain for get this... 490 or something ridiculous like that! I could fall on my ass and STILL make my rent with something like that. We talked... I plan on leaving new york in the increasingly near future.. Though this city is great, I swear it runs on grime and stress... I grew up here.....and I've left and come back and let me tell you, it drains you. It's been amazing and an amazing place for inspiration, creativity and expression but it's a shitty place to write... at least for me. I spend more time getting from A to B and stressing how I get there and less time being able to reflect on the trip. More of my time is spent getting money to have time to be a writer than actually writing.  When I was upstate, I still had a very full life. A waitressing job at Denny's , worked out 4 times a week, went to school full time, studied my ass off and my quality of life was so much better. During the summer my rent/expenses averaged to about 150 month (without beer and food) I could make that working at Denny's for two or three days. I had time to *gasp* live for a living   granted I lived in a shit hole  but it was MY shit hole and THAT shit hole had a huge kitchen  (with carpet older than dirt... yes carpet in a kitchen. How ghetto is that?) and broken windows and lots of light... and at night after work we bbq'ed on the porch and drank beers and Stephan Palermo read my poems/stories and we talked shit and watched the traffic go by.  I read books....  and I worked on plays and stories and obsessed over them as much as I damn well pleased. Now most of the productive writing I do is on my blog and even that always feels rushed. It's full of spelling errors and runs into streams of concious that even I have a hard time following. Maybe it's just me. I'm not the type of writer to just throw something on the page and have it be brilliant. For me the process is in the editing, the slaving over it, the obssession. Maybe that's why I've always considered myself a much better fiction/play wright than poet simply because of how great something can get out of sheer force of will where as poetry requires a wit that isn't always  that readily available.....  Anyway, when I found out that Eric was leaving...it just made sense. New York isn't for everyone, especially when its nervous energy simply serves to enervate you. Some people are made for this.... I'm not one of them.  It's just aged me, beyond my years maybe that's why my birthday seems to be coming too soon. I look into the mirror and I check for wrinkles... I have a friend who's CONVINCED that his hairline is receding (it's not) One of my oldest friends just gave birth to her second child... a premmie.. She's 21 She's on welfare now Half of NYC commutes from Queens or Long Island yet looking anyone in the eye is an act of overt agression. The pushing, the shoving...grinding the humanity straight out of you... the cubicles the office politics the cabbies that won't stop for you the dirt the grime the corruption don't get me started on the corruption $2 rides Bloomberg don't get me started on bloomberg the smoking the NO smoking the budget cuts the overcrowded schools the unemployment the homeless the crackheads....   new york,new york big city of dreams.....   MIKE: If you're too careful, your whole life can become a fuckin' grind

      Umm...did I mention that I love my dad? Thing is I'm not THAT much of a daddy's girl. He doesn't give me money or tell me that I'm right all the time. He's just honest, funny and he loves me to pieces  I love my dad. I needed to go home last nite but I have duty at 1pm which would make it do difficult to come back that  early so we decided to get a late nite dine at French Roast.  There's a reason why my dad is one of the best friends i have. There's so much love in my family between me my dad and my brother  but I came to an ephinany tonight vis a vis my depression.  I haven't felt like this since me and Mike broke up. I couldnt get out of bed and though i didnt want to die , i didnt' have the strength to want to live. I was just breathing and every day even THAT was struggle.....  Same symptoms different situation.  then i realized something...... I'm going through it too... I'm leaving this relationship with my mother we are ALL leaving her.  Most divorces are just between parents and the kids get tossed in the middle but it's this messed up dynamic with us vs HER. We ALL want this to happen and until it does we are all living in this weird limbo, waiting for life to start without this dark cloud hanging over us....   To say it hasn't affected my relationships would be a lie.  I've been in some really shitty ones. The kind that put your heart through a blender In the end I've always vaciated from playing the victim to being the stone cold hearted bitch  that some might paint me to be. I don't even know what the truth is before. I've been no angel but I certainly don't deserve what I've gotten either  I have developed such a contempt for relationships in general and the institution of  marriage in particular... The thought of even kissing someone makes me sick yet I still long for an intimacy that I know I can't handle. It requires so much work to tell the people i care about that I do in fact care, but that I have neither the time or the patience to really be there for anyone...... and any attempts at that just turns out seeming so ingenuine.  And my friends? take it so damn personal.... I feel like this huge weight on my loved ones... this heavy cloud bringing those I love down with me So my not being around? Please dont take it personal, it's not you.... it's me.  I need sex but i dont want to kiss any one  I need a hug but no sex....  the two are to volatile to mix right now....  that would require  *gasp* a relationship   Epiphany # 2  I hate God and I've lost my faith in humanity  what do i have left?

      Just so you know this is in response to  urlLink Dyanna's   Post on the Nerd Question.  urlLink   "there are many nerds and geeks who don't embrace their nerdiness, but would be much better off if they did."   I agree whole heartedly but before we continue I thought I'd take some  urlLink Nerd Tests   This did not help me in the search for Nerd clarity. So I asked one of my friends at MIT. We were in the same h.s. program. Him along with 4 other cohorts ended up at MIT. I ended up majoring in unemployment at the New School for  Social Research. Go figure... Here's what HE had to say..  Cassa: i've heard this a zillion times Cassa: but i never can get it straight Cassa: so i'm not sure Diane: lol Cassa: i think a nerd is a star trek person Cassa: and a geek is somebody who's interested in techie stuff Diane: hmm Cassa: but the nerd is more of a weirdo Cassa: and a geek is more of a technophile Cassa: or subjectphile  hmmm a subjectphile? So obssesive ness is part of nerd/geekdom  I still have no idea what a nerd is, however I did  up scoring Higher than Carl Sagan and  If you know who this guy is than you are in fact a nerd :) It's weird, i looked up and down for a good nerd definition and couldn't find one  And I have a natural aversion to stereotypes and  definitions especially since nerds are people who by definition fly in the face of those.  So how about this as a definition?   NERD  Though there are particulars to Nerd,geek and dork under it all is a just a group of people who dont' fit into whatever social rules they are expected to follow. They usually don't dress,act or think like they are supposed to. They are rarely seen as visionaries, simply outcasts. Because of a lifelong history of rejection, they lack whatever charisma they MIGHT have had has been killed and they are woefully sel-concious. They are usually obssessive because their ample brain wattage needs constant distraction less they think themselves to death. While Hollywood favors the science nerds, there are a whole slew of other nerds that rarely get mentioned. Take for example the ENTIRE slam scene :)    I saw the sexiness in Screech I believed in the genius of steve urkel (stephan to some) The greatest visionaries in the world were nerds.... If i looked at all the teachers that i've admired  they've all been socially inept on some level or other.     I've only been interested in people on the margins, they are just generally more interesting , however being different has it's price and those who embrace that have my respect more than anyone because that takes serious cajones...  So Dyanna asked me to classify her and myself Dyanna= Geek She's a loudmouth, she's opinionated, and she keeps it real. For as long as I've known her she's existed on those margins and that qualified for a second look and that's why i love  this girl so much. She rules in my book and she's a geek  extraordinaire. I can't share in her psychotic love for George Michael but I respect that she does it without shame. She does alot of things without shame and I respect her all the more :)  I? = Nerd-Slut.  I got this category from one of those quizzilla quizzes.   The computer geek with the penchant for S/M :) I am that nerd that those guys at Forbidden Planet dream about. I am that nerd under the guise of a geek.  I'm chronically obssesive about well..... EVERYTHING...  I was an eningeering major in highschool who spent her free time  reading 2600 magazine, synchronizing step motors on IC boards  that I etched myself with a program written by yours truly on an APPLE IIE. I made light shows with lasers and designed  cars to monster mash.  Yes... I competed in Boston University Peak Performance Challenged  and y es I still have the schematics for the car I built. My favorite toys were my soldering Iron. Know any girls that can hold a piece of IC board in one hand, a soldering iron in the other  and the solder in her mouth? sexy,sexy sexy....  I was president of the computer club and my aspirations included political activist/hacker.  The person you see right now is a brash, overly talkative extrovert  just to hide the paranoid, conspiracty theorist who sees this world through the eyes of George Orwell, Ted Kacyznski and Bernie S.  :)  I was voted most likely to shoot the president :) I am the most dangerous kind of nerd :)....... totally......completely....obssessive and crazy.  All other nerds  watch the fuck out :)  there's a new nerd in town   anyway....Nerd, Dork, Geek we are all hopelessy imperfect little creatures, each with our obssessions and  idiosynchrasies.  Be they Dungeons and Dragons, VB code,Fantasy Baseball,  taste in music, obssessive poets,manic-depressive, psychosmatic, bi polar or whatever they make us , us and negotiating through that space is what makes life important.  so? in the end.... who cares?  do we even need these labels?  No matter how we define them, they will still be derogatory in some form or other. Nigger is still offensive Spic is still offensive and Nerd is still offensive not because of how we define ourselves but because of how society defines us and while how we define ourselves is still important These words have a particular history to them and they've been coined by those on the in, not those on the margins.  As much as I've playfully embraced them in the end it's kind of hypocritical.... so lets just throw it out and be our crazy selves...

      It's been a while since I've been to Acentos and I've missed it.As a space there's this rotating group of new people,  new writers and new energy. I guess that's why the Acentos Mantra is    The New Hotness    Now I've never been the type of writer to write and then just get up on the mic read. The mic is not my friend, it never has been however it has been where alot of my battles with myself have been fought. I'm a secretive person by nature and I've suffered a great deal because of the details in my life that I'm unwilling to share and  sometimes going up on the mic does that for me. Helps me relieve the tension and the pain. I won't go so far as to ask for help but at least for a little bit I can share, yet somehow still  keep my distance.   Besides I'm far too obssessive and not nearly articulate enough to write on the fly like that. It's really funny, especially when I FIRST started reading I would have this  really eager stance on stage that just  screamed "love me, love me please! I have something important to say! really!"  So continuing,I've been blocked lately. Not that I haven't been writing..... I have but there's been this emotional block which has kept from from going in deep. When I say that I've never really been a poet it's because I honestly no longer respect words the way my compatriots do..the beauty of the line, the delicate rythm of words. My style is like an elephant in a china shop, clumbsy and confused. I ease up over time and space and interesting characters that unfold and surprise and plotlines that twist and turn   In my opinion the only thing that's made any of the poetry I've written at all interesting is the angle in which i look at things, more WHAT I have to say then how I say it. There is a certain insightfulness with which I'm so completely out  of touch with these days. In short, I ain't got anything important that important to say All of I have are descriptions of my days and my nights and the miracles in between  So i sat down at the bar and did it. Just wrote what was present. I had to force myself not to care what anyone thought. I battled with an undeniable immaturity ,slapped myself and screamed "Diane! grow the fuck up!"  I'm a smart gal who's immature and inexperienced as all hell and it's so frustrating because I'm so concious of it.  but for a little while  there was the word and the word was me    let the poetry be your prozac   - s.b.rojas    [..and] let the healing begin!! !  -Will (good will hunting)    and i did    .....thanks

            You're  The Sound and the Fury !   by William Faulkner     Strong-willed but deeply confused, you are trying to come to grips with a major crisis in your life. You can see many different perspectives on the issue, but you're mostly overwhelmed with despair at what you've lost. People often have a hard  time understanding you, but they have some vague sense that you must be brilliant anyway. Ultimately, you signify nothing.

      I just got a phonecall today from one of my creditors and I basically got reamed out by this asshole who called me a loser who couldn't get a job and found my lack of ability to pay my debt offensive.  I told him that luring 18 yr olds with credit cards and 20% interest is offensive. My 500 dollar debt has turned into 1200 dollars in interest alone. I haven't used a credit card in almost 3 years. I cut them up. In fact they've stopped sending me bills. The LITTLE money that I DO make goes towards paying them off and this one is one THEY just started calling me about. Honestly? I can't even REMEMBER having this card. Yeah Im a financial mess, usually something that I'd be to ashamed about to even mention but then I think about what got me into this mess. ,  I had paid off all my debt before moving to nyc anticipating a cushy job at AOL TIME WARNER well 9/11 killed THAT idea and the only thing I could do while going to school was waitress and bartend,but now I had an apartment and food/bills and I was not about to quit a school I had worked so hard to get into, so  I spent several months basically living on my credit cards. Long gone are the part time jobs with tuition re imbersment, medical and flexible hours. So I've always been semi employed just enough to pay for school and food and I've paid off most of  my bills so when I got this call, it was uncalled for. I'm sick of creditors calling me. I talk to them, tell them my situation and pay them when I get money, but is there no recourse for this kind of harassment? Can they call me up and start yelling at me and berating me?  I'm like FUCK  YOU MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLE! IM DOING THE BEST I CAN YOU FUCKER! I GET PAID 600 dollars for the WHOLE FUCKING SUMMER!  *sigh..............christ   I'm gonna go watch  Tru-Life I'm a Muay Thai Fighter.

       Listening to:  ....Lauryn Hill, Gangstarr, Beastie Boys  State of Mind:  .....Colorado and Brooklyn  This is a really long, really random post. I'll try to organize it, but bear with me please.   1. The Coffee Shop Sessions  Tuesday has officially become dinner at 3 AM night with my dad. He's working on this letter, condeming the unethical practices of the shareholders at the limo company he works at Communicar Inc. Here's an Excerpt:   "....The divide is not about race, nor is it about differences in either ethnicity or nationality. Its about right and wrong. It is about the duplicitous actions of this board, the double standard practices that have become typical of this administration......"   sound vaguely not surprising?   "Our plan is to effectively stop this machinery of corruption, deceit and bring Communicar back to respectability. Finally our plan is to make equitable distribution  THE LAW  ..........."   Yeah the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.t ooooooooo....machinery of corruption? words to make any leftist girl just swoon And you WONDER where I get my attitude from??!! ;) Add to that my sarcasm, aggressive debate style and my ability to emasculate psuedo intellectual liberal arts boys in a single bound!  Editing this letter was a trying affair to say the least, but as annoyed as I get editing his shit,I'm very proud of him. I've  always wanted to be just like him.Smart logical, inspiring ....  He's taught me about morality, about standing up for what you believe in, about staying in touch with my humanity amidst a world that consistently tries to strip it away. Anyway the letter is finished and it's dope. It's got the Board ready to run with it's tail between it's legs, hopefully the drivers will sue and get their due...   urlLink COMMUNICAR INC  and COMMUNICAR CORRUPTION COMMUNICAR HANS ROY COMMUNICAR UNFAIR ETHICAL PRACTICES COMMUNICAR COMMUNICAR COMMUNICAR MTV,COMMUNICAR AOL TIME WARNER, COMMUNICAR THEFT, THIEVERY, THIEVES,COMMUNICAR, COMMUNICAR DRIVERS, COMMUNICAR FAQ,COMMUNICAR, UNION, COMMUNCAR HANS ROY, DIANE ROY, YOLANDE ROY, LENNY, Naveed Sheikh  yeah that should be enough for the google search engines ;) don't mess with the Roy cosa nostra   moving on.....    2. Top 5 Google Searches that get you to my site A) lump+in+ throat+ panic+ attack B)  poetry about tig ole bitties (i thought i deleted that post!) C) mysogonist (yeah....you type in mysogonist and I come up???) D) marc anthony pathetic marriage ( i hope my letter to j.lo got to her)  and the NUMBER ONE SEARCH THAT LEAD TO MY SITE?!?! *drum rolll.........  1. This message was brought to you by   THE LETTER "M"  ...yes folks someone typed in  the letter M and came to my site. I tried it again and it didn't work but sitemeter NEVER lies.   3.  Speaking of GOOGLE SEARCHES  I recently got THIS email:    john hunter   wrote:  hi,   did you know you are a  urlLink googlewhack?    -John     4. Poetry 4 Beer   My friend Amelie just asked me to do a show on saturday. Honestly It'll just be a chance to hang out with her again. This girl friggin rules! (And Fish she's white and single)She's a  Eugene Lang alum,fighting the goodfight and right now I miss my radical lang friends :)I'm actually looking forward to fall, even though most of my buds have graduated.If you have any angry political poems that you wanna spit in exchange for free boos hit me up  urlLink backchannel.  It's a  urlLink party to help register African American Voters,  so yes it's for a good cause and you'll get heard and get drunk.    5. The Psych Sessions   No matter how much I beg, my therapist simply REFUSES to give me drugs. Seriously! If you don't know, or have had your eyes shut every time you've  seen me, I've spent that past (don't want to specify)in a deep, deep, deep  depression. What's made me feel so hopeless lately is not the pain, but how used to it I am right now, how I've spent most of my life living in survival mode. I've been up to my ears in self analysis, trying to figure out what's wrong with me,what keeps me in this place. I know entirely TOO many people who love this state, who DEPEND on this state, to write, to relate, to love, to whatever. I'm not one of them. I WANT to get better, I'm fighting to get better. I don't care if I never write another damn fucking poem, a short story, a blog entry. I would gladly give that up for happiness, to be able to love freely, peacefully. Does that make me less dedicated to my craft? I don't think so, i'm just not willing to sacrifice my sanity for the sake of my art. Personally, I find having to be depressed to right, a shitty crutch. I mean seriously everyone does it.....writing just to get through? Well that's fine, but that can't be what ALL of your work is about or other wise I can't really respect you as a writer. What do I respect? Vision and it's really hard to see in the darkness at the bottom of the barrell.....  So anyway....She won't give me drugs. She says that so far all my problems are external  My response:   "So can I get a prescription for homocide?"   she laughed. I didn't.  There is an epidemic of depression going on. Maybe I'm too sensitive, maybe I set my sights on people entirely too high and set myself up  for dissappointment....but that's not it. I can make a list of things not going right in my life and if I were to win the jackpot tomorrow, I could probably slice half of what ills me off that list.  My generation is the first to  do significantly worse than their parents.  urlLink Right now we are facing higher unemployment then during the Great Depression.   In the past year I know three people (including myself) who've attempted suicide for one reason or another ranging from deep depression to manic attacks to (me) bad drug interactions....Between the New School University and NYU we've had about 5 suicides one on my floor in the room across the hall from me. Ive spent most of the past semester administering suicide watches for my residents. Approximately 2/3 of them are on some sort of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic. The 16 year old girl down the hall is a recovering coke-addict, and shes one of The  normal ones. Coincidence?  Its as if there is a cancer of the soul spreading through this nation. MLK predicted this in  His 1969 vietnam speech:   urlLink   This business  of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.     And here we are. We closet ourselves from the world with our cellphones and walkmans and ipods. Looking someone in the eye is an act of overt aggression. Its ok to not know your neighbors, fuck the person in front of you, they are in your way And youve got to  Get  Get Get Get Get ..get *sigh.  Anyway  urlLink  5. A Nod to Guys commentary on Kerrys ineffectual-ness   Ive got a new conspiracy theory. The reason why Kerrys platform is so close to Bushs is because they are in the urlLink  same camp.  We are just being given the ILLUSION of democracy. I doubt if Bush  actually really cares if he wins or loses because the Kerry administration will be acting in his interest ANYWAY. The war for oil control in Iraq will continue and Bush money will be safe. Dont believe me? Check THIS out..yeah, these jackasses are bloodbrothers.  urlLink YES! They are both Skulls!  Choose or Lose? Give me a break! WHAT FUCKING CHOICE????  Just same old U.S. business as usual double speak. Im sure the Thought Police are going to be knocking down my door soon..  I really feel bad for P-diddy in his Vote Or Die rally.  Its sad really. Its really nice that hes getting people to register to vote, but that assumes that you have a choice, Both candidates pretty much agree on everything, just Kerry couches a lot nicer. Ive decided that Im going to Audition for American Idol, just so that I can wear my Kucinich or Death T-shirt.  Fuck America, you complacent Mother Fuckers!    6. To Continue on My anti-american rant.   How do we win the War on Terror? WE ARE THE TERROR! Jesus Christ! Dont believe me?  urlLink  Go here To check out the U.S. plan for Global domination.  Iraq is only the beginning  With this kind of aggressive , imperialistic foreign policy , we are setting ourselves up for attack and this constant state of war only serves to further legitimize the current administration. WAKE UP!   7. Ok a break from all that Hate  Now that Fish has retired his blog, and Guys ill placed cubicle prevents him from posting as often as Id like Ive had to go elsewhere for my daily blog updates. Ive  Also devised a blog wish list.   Top 5 People Who should Have Blogs and Dont  1.	Salome Gonzalezshes the OTHER malcontent  Ok I cant think of any other ones right now,but please feel free to add to this list. Sal, please get a blog. It would be sooooooooooooo fun.  wow.... I feel a little better now :)  I'm gonna go live long and prosper

       urlLink  Good poker is something that requires discipline. However, even good players are often tempted to do things they know are bad ideas when they get frustrated, angry, or upset for any reason. They go "on tilt." Typical tilt play is much too loose and often very aggressive, beacause a player on tilt wants very badly to win a pot, and isn't rational enough to wait for cards that are worth playing or situations that are worth attacking.      Ummm..........yeah I think I'm starting to develop a problem. I never understood  how people actually GOT addicted to gambling before. Alchohol yes, drugs yes,  but gambling? Just fucking STOP  and then? came poker....  The thing is, that lately it has served as a metaphor for life;  mine in particular  Take for example my first foray onto Party Poker. I'm basically  still paying to learn how to play the game but, because of the way  I've been losing I've set up some rules for myself  like  1. don't see a flop without pairs above 9  2. don't see a flop without suited face cards  3. if you haven't hit your hand by the river don't chase it  4. check in with your emotions every 5 hands.  5. When you lose leave  6. When you don't leave  Now I see how you can lose your shit at the .5/1 Omaha tables.  They just don't respect pre flop raises so that even when  you've got the nuts you've also got alot of competition  and you're playing with a much more limited deck.   Poker as in life is about discipline and patience. If you have the  discipline the odds are in your favor. The cards WILL come to you.  Good poker players are revealed over time. Anyone can get a run of bad  cards, that's just life, but keeping your wits about it and waiting for  the right ones to play is a true test of one's strength  and in life, (mine in particular) it's a real test of your maturity level  and how well you are coping and lately with me  it hasn't been very well.   My emotional cup has been full for a long time.  I've got so much going on that  when little things happen, my tendency is to tilt  further and further  The tendency to self-destruct is also alot higher on tilt.  When you win your are invincible and when you lose  you are convinced that the world was created JUST to make you  miserable, truth is everyone gets dealt bad hands,some  worse than others, and when you start off on a bad streak  it takes alot of resilence to get you out of it.  It takes alot of faith to believe and understand that  this will eventually blow over   so don't play too many hands just smile  wait for the right cards and when they come, invest in them and do so heavily .......but  keep your eyes on your chips  Don't give them away needlessly   Diane

      The last good broadway show I saw was Chicago, which was entertaining though not mindblowing, but today, I finally saw a Broadway show, worth raving abuot, worth recommending to my friends...and  this show is Avenue Q, Tony Winner for Best Musical and it is TOTALLY, TOTALLY WORTH IT.  What's it about?  Imagine if they rewrote sesame street for adults   AVENUE Q is the story of Princeton, a bright-eyed   (and well hung)  college grad who comes to New York City  with big dreams and a tiny bank account. He soon discovers  that the only neighborhood in his price range is Avenue Q;  still, the neighbors seem nice.    With endearing songs like " Everyone's a little bit Racist ","  You Can Be as Loud as the Hell  You Want (When You're Makin' Love)"  and "   I'm not Wearing anyUnderwear Today " it's tons of fun for the whole (anyone above 16) family.  I don't want to ruin the show for anyone who might see it, but I was in stitches the whole time :) It's well worth the money.

      I had a show on Saturday night at New Nation, this outdoor gathering of activists, teachers, ravers and just a smorgasborg of different orginazations. When my friend asked me to read I thought that it was going to be this tiny room/party or in a club/or bar. No, there were multiple stages and art shoes, a hookah bus, this weird slingshot contraption that folks were riding.....I ended up having a *special* cupcake. Never had one before and didn't really believe in it's "special"ness considering that it didn't cost very much.......I was more hungry than anything. Soon there were at least 2000 people at this thing. I ended up running into alixa and naima and Farbeon and his girlfriend...It was really great... right under the manhattan bridge, right next to the water, I haven't been near the water in a while.....  still  kinda of weird. AT least too weird to be there alone with the cupcake kicking in. I ended up leaving right around the time that the naked guy started walking around...... I don't remember much after that,  just that the line to get in was around the block....       My shadows Shedding skin and Ive been picking Scabs again. Im down Digging through My old muscles Looking for a clue.   -tool

      Now I know most of blog readers won't vote Republican if they vote at all but for all of you random people that make it over to my site, reread your checklist on what you need to ask yourself before you vote, don't vote, or decide to rider the Nader ticket      Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when  Bush's   daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.   Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against  Iraq.   A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body,  but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.   Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and  Hillary Clinton.  The best way to improve military morale is to praise the  troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.   If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.  A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies,  then demand their cooperation and money.  Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.  HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.  Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.  A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.  Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution,  which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.  The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but  George Bush's driving record is none of our business.  Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery.  You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.  What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.  Are you registered to vote? If not, head over to www.declareyourself.com or www.rockthevote.com to make your voice heard!

       listening to:  God loves Ugly  -Atmosphere   Last night was Guy's feature which was fun...lots of fun, more fun than I've had in a while, no pressure, no drama and a MUCH needed break. Oscar said that my theme song was  Avril Lavigne's  Complicated ......   Normally, I'd protest but within the context he was right. My life is complicated on it's own, but how I've chosen to deal with things or better yet NOT deal,my hyper-sensitivity,my need  to deconstruct and overanalyze everything just MIGHT add to the drama........ just maybe maaaaaaaybe lol....  hey I'm working on it. What helps is honesty. It simplifies the conversation. Honesty not just with myself but  with others as well.  I'm sick of lying and keeping secrets. I've been doing that my whole life and I'm not doing it anymore. It's killing me. It's gotten to a point where I can't give a straight answer to save my life and when people push I feel cornered and the cycle begins anew. Ask me a question and you'll see.    Person: So what do you think of slam?  Diane:  Well the real question is what IS slam? Where has slam been where is slam going?.....   Person: So are you seeing anyone?  Diane:  I see people all the time. I'm seeing you right now...   Person:  What's your name?  Diane:  well there are names and there are identities......  And I can and will go on like this forever.....I'll just talk until you forgot what you asked in the first place :) Just take a hint and drop it. I'll let you know when I feel like it.   soo.....  last night I read Tesseract and got some great ideas/edits for it. I subsequently got into a discussion on a theory of love with a highschool physics teacher in the audience....it was dope :) Then we talked about string theory.... I miss physics...... *sigh   Sal was there and heard me read for the first time and she liked it! This means alot because from my understanding Salome doesn't like poetry, or better yet  she doesn't like bullshit. and pretention. and poets. Period. Ironically Tesseract has not been my favorite poems, because it can do alot more. It's one of those poems that upon first read it SOUNDS really cool, but when you reread it, it's just a bunch of fluff at least to me it is, maybe I don't like it so much because of it's  potential to go much further and much deeper. Lately it's nice to have your work liked PERIOD. Artistically I haven't  gotten that support and my ego needed stroking/validation.    Anyway being the total geek that I am I said "yeah I'm a closet nerd" and  Salome responds:  Closet? You mean glass closet with the the doors wide open? Girl you are a NERD!  (*note:If you suspect that you're full of shit, have a conversation with Sal and she'll clear that up for you)  I don't know why that validation made me feel so cool. The Nerd Validation not the poet one.......ummm  because you're a nerd. Yup.  So speaking of Sal and of honesty, here's another  quizzical Quirk.   I consider myself heterosexual, meaning I'm attracted sexually and romantically to men and exclusively so. In this bi-curious world of gender ambiguity, that's probably one of the few really defined things about myself.......I've never been into women, I've never been repressed about being into women, I've had many opportunities to be with women. I figured if it was going to happen it would have already.  However I still get crushes ;) I'd say it was admiration but it's more than that. Never really having a woman to look up to growing up I get these weird non-sexual crushes on women that I look up to. If freud ever factored women in his psychoanalysis maybe he'd talk about the effect of maternal absence on girls...  When I was a freshman it was my Voice teacher.... Strong, beautiful, confident, talented, when she walked by everything happened  in slow motion.... but it wasn't sexual and it was more than admiration.... When I came to New York I there were a string of women who fit this category.... and secretly they  became my blueprint...for the woman I wanted to become....they've been helping me grow up...grow into that woman I want to be come....I just have no idea how.  So here I am 23 and still awkward and goofy, trying to tap into a woman that is confident,graceful and gracious........ Men...if women are a mystery to you, they are an even bigger mystery to me and I AM one   And In Totally UnRelated Poetry News  1. urlLink Evert Eden  joins the blogging community.

As of last night Team Providence at NPS is on the run :)    I have a special place in my heart for anarchists and a newfound    respect for Carlos Gomez and Jive Poetic. *quoted from guy's livejournal  urlLink    Jared Paul and the Providence team apparently caused some drama at the opening ceremonies with a group piece related to the Abu Ghraib prison tortures that included Jared in a loincloth and some accidental nutsack peek-a-boo that led to him being arrested for indecent exposure. The resulting hubbub reportedly shut down the opening ceremonies! Some are dismissing him as an opportunistic asshole. Personally, I applaud his efforts and hope some of those t-shirt wearing faux-activists take notes.    here here. Showing your balls and risking getting kicked off stage is applaudable. So is team that does either all or mostly group pieces...I'll stop now.   4. All the NYC teams have won their bouts and are in the top 15.  5. Three New Yorkers, (two nuyoricans and a transplant) are in the top 10     6. While I understand that last night was Guy's final feature/appearance, part of me treats it as Cher's repeated farewell tours and Jay-Z's black album: It's difficult for me to believe that I'll be hearing the last of him poetically. However taking the pressure off has a tendency to open you up to writing more. I understand the need to break off, break out. I'm in a similar place or similar plateau. I'm excited to see what the future holds, artistically and personally :) Guy's  inspired me poetically and personally.... I doubt he realizes the influence he's had on me as a writer. How does it feel was inspired by  Leaps of Faith  Sanctity of Stillness inspired by his poem  Salome  Enough of the ego stroking, ya know I loves ya like a fat kid love cake... and I love cake. Like several people said last night, I wouldn't still be involved in this scene where it not for guy, which is ironic since he was never around for most of my slam career, but his voice lingers in my head.

       Ok........something you may never have known about me   When I was in highschool I used to be a diver. Yes, me.  The springboard kind, with the flips and such? YES I was lot smaller then, before the college poundage before the pressure of  a j-o-b I just wanted to dive,  to just fly off the  1 meter or the 3 meter. If you dive of the platform wrong you can break your wrist/arm whatever...   Thing is I didn't care,I loved the feeling of flying. When I slept I dreamt about diving. I did pike-outs before bed and when I woke up.  During practice we got punished for fear. If we balked (chickened out) it was 20 push-ups.. and then it happened. Diving is a mental sport and in my obsession I practiced about 6 hours a day. I tried doing a back dive with 1 1/2 twists and it  was beautiful..... I went straight up, then straight down.......  onto the board.  Over the next couple of months fear crept in.... as well as my increasing sense of mortality... Off to college, and I never stepped on a board again.. I just walked away, now I'll walk off of a board and maybe maybe do a cannon ball..  When I got to new york it was slam. A jilted singing career and I tried to conquer my fear and get in touch with my anger by slamming.....and the more I did..... the more the fear crept in again......  so then I started doing muay thai... I got injured and now that I've healed I'm trying to find my way back into a gym that I've been to a million times before and left fearlessly with bruises, black eyes and busted lips... and the fear is creeping back in again...  Now it's poker....I got such a rush/release playing for the first time.....  and all of the minor rushes in between.  I just turned 23 and i feel 43...... I know I'm using these as examples but this fear has stretched into other matters of my life, places in which I'm unwilling to change, doors I'm too afraid to open, to walk through.... And I live my life a fearful person, paranoid. I'm not talking about my government conspiracy theories because they ARE watching us and I'm certainly not afraid of them.... I'm more afraid of those closest to me....  The ones I love The ones that I'm afraid to love too much The ones that I'm afraid won't love me back and each year I rack up proof I rack up a number of  people who serve as reasons as to why I shouldn't put myself out there reasons why I shouldn't be open to relationships that are healthy and provoking  and this shit happens.....fucked up people who will hurt you happen just like Im justified in my fear of diving of muay thai of loving  but isn't the feeling of flying worth the risk of falling?   so let's try at an honest moment   Amidst all of my family drama, I have a family that I've kept hidden to my friends, to my little brother. Until very recently he never knew that I was his half sister. He never knew that we didn't share the same father but I did, and I wasn't allowed to tell him. On top of this I couldn't acknowledge the only grandmother I had, still claims me as her own........ In a family that fit iller than the O.J. glove, she's the only one that ever claimed me, indignantly as her own. Swore to love me and protect me no matter what.....and the way I've treated her, ignored her, haven't acknowleged her she's still there.... 80 going on forever she still claims me hers... and it's taken me a year to return her calls and the other night I was on the phone with her.....in tears My aunt was there telling me how much she loved me, how much blood was thick, how I didn't know the whole story, how much she forgave me and I shook I just shook and shook....  with fear  I've been failed by everyone I've ever trusted in every conceivable way,   and here was this woman, my blood offering me what I'm too proud to admit that I need...   and my toes curl around the board I roll my shoulders and peer out into the water hoping to fly

       So it's been a while since I wrote in this thing mainly because I hated the format that Diane originally put in for me.  She says she's going to fix it but even so, I had to get this out, and there really is no one to talk to about it with so I figured why not put it up here.  It seems that everyone around me is dealing with some problem or another.  Mostly romantic ones.  I have one friend who is sleeping with her buddy but they're more than fuck buddies because there's emotion there that they're too 'afraid' to discuss.  I have another friend thats in love with his best friend but cant do anything about it because she's not feeling him like that.  Another friend has been separated for a few months and is filing the divorce papers as we speak.  Yet another is breaking up with her ass...I mean man after 6 years and 2 kids.  Another friend has been actively trying to have a baby to no avail.  And lastly, a friend that just broke up because at first he was feeling the love, and the guy wasn't and then the guy was and he wasn't anymore.    I know all about all of their problems because I'm constantly talking to them about it and trying to 'help' in any way that I can.  From talking about it to avoiding talking about it.  From taking their side to playing the devil's advocate.  From listening on the phone to being there in person.  From listening to them swear off the opposite (or same) sex to signing them up to Match.com for another go 'round.  I have BAD TMJ issues because I worry so much about everyone.  Oh, and dont get me started on how much I worry about Steve.  Lordy lordy lordy.    Me? I havent been able to talk about me to anyone really.  I feel like my problems have taken second place to everyone else's because I dont have much to complain about.  My life is good.  I'm extremely happy in my relationship and even though I've gained a significant amount of weight since meeting my hunny, I wouldnt change a thing if I could do it all again. (ok, maybe I wouldnt eat so much and I'd have exercised more, but that's it.)  That said, not having that much to complain about doesnt mean I have *nothing* to complain about.  My grandmother has been in and out of the hospital for the past 2 months or so.  She's got congestive heart failure which basically means that her heart is weakening, and isnt able to circulate her blood as well, causing her to have fluid in her lungs which causes her to not be able to breathe as well...so basically she doesnt look good.  She looks OLD and tired and more than anything else, I wish I could be more  there  for her.  As it is, I can hardly communicate with her because my grasp on the Spanish language is so limited I always need an interpreter around if I cant figure out how to say what I want to say... another problem is I dont know WHAT to say.  I cant say that I'm indifferent but when my father was sick, it was so much easier to just hang out and talk to him about shit.  I was able to tell him how much I loved him before he died whereas I cant really express that with my granny and it hurts.  What also hurts is that my brother and I are kinda sorta on the outs, my other brother I dont really have much to say to because we're so different and my mother? Oh lordy, lets not even get into that.  Nice woman with the best intentions but she drives me batty.  What scares me most of all is that I see a lot of myself in her.  I'm scared that when my granny passes away, we'll have nothing to keep us together.  What scares me even more is when I wonder if that's really such a bad thing...  I'm graduating in June (if I could just pass this one Spanish class - another thing to stress about daily) and yet I have no plans to go to grad school or go into the Psychology field.  I'm totally content with my job.  The only thing I really want is a baby.  It seems like its all I can think about lately.  Even through all the pain that my friends are going through.  Even though I know this world can be pretty fucked up.  Sue me.  I just want one with all my heart.  ...And yet I fear - no, I KNOW - I'll drive my kid crazy (it's inevitable).  At the end of the day I feel drained.  The advice I give to my friends is almost never heeded which drives me bonkers and I'm just fuckin' beat from THINKING so much.  Why cant I just stop THINKING and WORRYING?!?  Why is it so hard to let everyone just live their lives as they see fit?  Has the maternal instinct in me just taken it that much further?  Will I ever stop?  Is anyone truly, truly happy?

       So this past Saturday's new show by Guy LeCharles Gonzalez was off the hook. http://louderthanwords.blogspot.com Its a new thing he's doing and I think its something that could go places.  Its not something that could or even should be done every week but as a monthly thing it could be totally great!  Here's the deal.  There's poetry, then there's spoken word poetry. There are writers and then there are performance poets.  There's the open mic vs. the slam.  Some spoken word poets actually manage to write some good shit, but it doesnt always happen that way.  Slam has a specific format.  It has to be a certain length for starters.  Also, its a competition.  Many people use the slam as a stepping stone, and some have never stepped far from it.  Many people have been slamming for yeeeears, some using the same poems that helped them win 8 years ago!    I give credit to people like Taylor Mali who get into the competition using NEW material every other year.  Taylor's been around the block a few times, has won more than once, and (*I think*) helped create and solidify the rules of Slam.  I believe he slams now for fun, and for the sake fo competition, not because he has nothing else to do with himself...  Sigh.  I dunno...the whole slam scene has gotten so cliquish and tired.  I used to be such a HUGE fan of it, but after hanging out with poets for awhile I realized that many of them NEED the slam because they crave the attention and they seemingly have nothing else going for them.  Newbies are ostracised, innovative ideas get thrown aside because of egos.  OH, the EGOS!  Dont get me started.    Anyhoo, so Guy.  The man, the myth, the legend.  He's my brother from another mother...and father... He headed up A Little Bit Louder on Monday nights at Bar 13 in Manhattan.  Then he moved away and when he came back, and back onto the scene, he was treated like a deadbeat dad.  The baby had grown up and didnt 'need' him anymore.  The beautiful loving baby turned into the goth/punk fucked up delinquent teenager that didnt need parenting anymore because they knew best.  So metaphorically, his stepkid Acentos (Tuesday nights in the Bronx) still loved him and let him into their life.  Aww.  I've been to Acentos once, and it was nice.  Havent made my way back yet, but I should.  Great things are coming outta there, it seems.  Ok so once again, I go off on a tangent.  My point?  Guy has this new thing going at the Bowery Poetry Club downtown.  Its a debate.  Kinda like the McLaughlin Group with more color.  On Saturday it was 'oldtimers' talking about the slam and why they continue with it.  Taylor Mali was there with Roger Bonair Agard.  Guy co-hosted with Helen Yum and Eric Guerrieri.  Taylor was misinterpreted with his answer to a certain question about rape but he stood his ground and had conviction in what he was saying.  Roger was very much 'look at me, I'm cute and clever. I'm going to mask the fact that I'm not really saying anything'.  Roger, I'm sorry honey, I love ya, but take a stand, man!    I actually talked to Roger after the show and asked him the question I wanted to while he was on stage.  "You still compete in the slam.  Why? If you want to be heard, why not just go on the open mic and call it a night?  Why compete at all anymore?" He told me that Slam began to give the opportunity to be heard by many people and that the competition aspect of it is secondary.  Okay.  But he's been around long enough.  He's been on Def Poetry Jam twice, and he tours all over.  So that doesnt really answer my question.  He's proven that he doesnt need the slam anymore and yet he still does it.  Go figure.  What I loved MOST about Saturday was that it was too short. It left everyone wanting more.  EVERYONE was walking out of there talking about it.  The conversations continued through dinner and into the next day.  THAT was way cool.  It was the first time doing a format like this and there were a few things that are going to be tweaked before the next show (like not being able to SEE people raising their hands in the audience after asking for people's participation - next time, someone will be combing the audience for hands)  This Saturday, April 3, it will be about Def Poetry and all the things that surround it.  Russell Simmons, opportunist or patron of the arts?  You decide.

       Still getting used to the blogging thing.  It's kinda cool, and Diane, my computer saavy pal is helping me create a cool format in which to write in.  Aint that schweet of her? awww.  Anyway onto other more important things.  Hello?! The Apprentice, anyone?  Can you say THANK YOU LORD DONALD TRUMP FOR FIRING OMAROSA!  That bitch had to go!  I mean really!  She was the epitome of the person no one would want to work with.  She was holier than thou, had the stankiest attitude and, well, was kinda lazy, if I do say so myself!  She tried to play Donald too! I couldnt believe the nerve this woman had.  Who will take the prize? I believe it will be either Nick or the blond curly haired chick that Nick is in love with.  She's never once been to the Board Room.  I love this show so much its sickening.  I seriously need to get out more.

        Oh what a beautiful mooooorrrrniiiing, oh what a beautiful daaaay - hey wait a minute, why the heck does it look cloudy all of a sudden?  What kinda shit is that?  Hmmph.  Got my 6-month review yesterday.  Positive: I'm loved over here, not only by my bosses but by the CEO who, as I hear it, doesnt really like or trust anyone.  So that's all good.  I still have a job.  Negative: I only got a miniscule raise because the company is trying to fix its budget.  A raise is a raise, I know, but I like to feel it in my check, if you know what I mean.  I mean, I like to look at my check with my new raise and go "whoo hoo!" like I did when first got this job and realized that Jersey takes out WAY less taxes than NY... but alas, its only like $40 a paycheck more.  I get another review in November and by then I'll supposedly be taking on more responsibility AND I'll have a BA, man!  YEAH BABY, YEAH!  So I can really talk $$ then.  However, in reality, even if they didnt give me that much then either, I wouldnt leave here.  Although I could be making more in the City or something, I really truly like the people here and the office is so close to home.  It couldnt get better than this.    Something of note... I have to stay over my grandmother's house tonight because my mother, who has been her main caretaker, is off on some Senior Center hike or something near Ithaca, NY.  So I've got 'watch over grandma' duty tonight and my brother and his wife are going there tomorrow night.  My granny has a tendency to think she can do more than she actually can, so she tends to fall a lot and also has trouble breathing at night so someone has to literally sleep in the bed with her.  So, needless to say, I'm extremely anxious right now.    Firstly, I have serious trouble sleeping in a place/bed that's not my own (unless its a hotel and even then the first night is usually uncomfortable).  But in this case, I used to actually live there, and so it causes me even more anxiety than normal.  Strange, right?  Well, I'm not really one to go backwards in life.  I tend to not look back when I leave something.  I am not the type to move back in with the parents if the going gets rough.  That's just not me.  Mainly because I have a strained relationship with my family...   However, my anxiety comes from a different place.  I moved in with my granny and my dad when I couldn't take it anymore at my mom's.  My grandmother does not speak English.  I don't really speak Spanish.  I think the only word she knows in English is "tenk you!" so obviously, it was hard to communicate with her being there.  At the time, I had my dad there as the interpreter and I was taking Spanish in HS.  By the time I left there, I was able to speak Dominican (as opposed to real Spanish, hehe) and we were able to talk.  Moved out, and a few American boyfriends later, I had lost all my Spanish speaking abilities.    When my father passed away, I visited my grandmother less and less.  Part of it was because the house reminded me of my daddy, and part was because of the fact that I couldnt just have a conversation with her.  It was soooo difficult.  Then she started getting sick, and I got anxious about the fact that I couldnt talk to her about how she was feeling and whatnot.  I can't stand to sit in that house for more than a hour.  It's a terrible thing and I'm a terrible granddaughter, I know it.  My sister in law is a better granddaughter than me, but even so, my granny loves the hell outta me and never says one bad thing about me!  I buy her sugarfree Jello and I'm a fuckin' princess!  Go figure.  My Spanish has gotten better, from college classes, and when there's someone else in the house who speaks English, I can have an interpreter if I need one...so things have brightened up a little.  I even try to visit her once a week, even if it's only for a half hour or so...  Well, anyway, I'm still anxious about being there tonight.  I now have to  sleep  in this house ALONE with her.  The grandmother, the house and the neighborhood that does not speak English.  The house that gave me horrible allergies. The same house where a waterbug crawled across my face and traumatized me for life.  A house where my father no longer resides and where my grandmother is dying.  Basically, I feel like no one can truly understand this anxiety and it sucks ass.  Wish me luck.

        There's a movie coming out called "Super Size Me" about this guy who ate solely McDonald's food for a month to basically document how much damage it did to his body.  He gained something like 30 pounds in that month and his cholesterol shot through the roof amongst other things... He did this as a  project  to educate the masses...  Then there are the actresses and actors that gain and lose weight for roles.  Renee Zellweger gained 30 or so for the first Bridget Jones, lost it all and then some for Chicago, then gained it again for the sequel to BJ...Robert DeNiro gained and lost for Raging Bull, and Tom Hanks gains and loses all the time for different roles.  These people all work with trainers, I know... It may not be easy to gain or lose, but when your livelihood depends on it and you're making $10-$20  million  on the next film where you're supposed to be a size ___, I'd do whatever was needed too...  That said, what does one do when one has been gaining weight at a steady pace yet is not particularly depressed, not really that self loathing and is in love with someone who loves you for you no matter what?  Obviously I'm talking about myself, here...  Being a fat teenager and young adult, I really sorta resigned myself to being that way.  It was only lonliness, frustration and a 30 pound weight gain spurt that got me to lose in the first place.  And even then, I always thought that 185 was where my body wanted to be, and I was content in just getting back down to that.  But my steady progress made me want more.  Made me  NEED  more.  So I kept at it.  Exercising almost every day and eating right brought me down to a sexy 147 in less than a year.  And I fluctuated a little here and there, but never went over 160 in over 2 years.  I was  proud  of that and people were proud  of  me.    Now times have changed and things have changed.  I married someone who loves food like me.  With his coaxing I started school again.  I moved to Brooklyn taking away my daily walk through the park.  I wanted to spend time with him and on school work more than I wanted to go to the gym.  I started to gain weight and so did he.  We joined Weight Watchers to get ourselves back on track.  We started going to the gym together (which didnt really work since we had different workout routines).  Then he lost more than I did, even though I was trying so hard and I quit.  My quitting made him quit.  We gained the weight we lost back in no time.  At that point I had gained about 60 of the 70 pounds I lost back.  It had taken about the same amount of time to gain it back as it had to lose it.  Things changed again.  I started taking more classes at school making my eating schedule extremely erratic.  Then I lost my job in the city, we moved to New Jersey, I got a job in Jersey that I have to drive to.  And while Steve walks most of the time from Port Authority, I walk NOWHERE.  Not even to Blockbuster Video about a half mile away.  I drive EVERYWHERE now.  And there are never really sales in the supermarkets for healthy food, just the bad stuff.  Entenmann's, 2 for $5.  Sour Cream, $0.99, Pudding, 3 for $4... Lettuce, $2.99.   SIGH .  The only time I get exercise is raking the leaves or chasing after my friend's kids when they visit.    All of the weight is back and then some.  Some?  No, that's an understatment.  All the weight I lost is back, plus about another 20 pounds  at least .  I am pushing out of sizes I'd never dream of being in in the first place.  I feel like I look pregnant and I'm not remotely.  To me, I dont look like me anymore.  I mean, when I lost all the weight initially, I used to stare in the mirror because I truly didnt recognize myself.  Now I'm having the opposite problem, however, I dont stare in the mirror because what I see scares the heck outta me.  Let me make this clear.  I am not writing this because I want your pity.  I'm not writing this because I'm depressed,  per se ...I guess I'm writing because I'm in a rut.    I think it hit me last night after ordering out for like, the fourth day in a row that I wasn't feeling good.  I was eating and not enjoying it.  I'm unhappy with the way I look and feel, I hate that I have no energy and that with the weight came MORE laziness (if that were even fathomable) and overall I'm fed up...AGAIN... however, I'm not unhappy in general, and that my friends, is what stops me from taking it seriously enough.  I just want to be proud of myself again for my sexy legs or the fact that I can wear a bikini... Shit like that.  I want to feel good about myself again physically, because I feel just dandy on a intellectual level, a romantic level, an emotional level and on a work level...no, seriously!!  I'm going to try again, and by writing it out and making it public, maybe I'll stick to it.  The weather is getting nicer and school is almost over.  Nothing should really get in my way.  I will make a conscious effort to eat all those dang Smart Ones and Lean Cuisines clogging up the freezer.  I will fry less.  I will NOT order out.  I will ride my new bike and take a walk when the weather permits.  I will get my ass to the ground to garden.  I will get my shit together.  NOW.

        I thought that pain was a sign that something is wrong.  If that is the case, wouldnt it be logical to assume that if you have no pain then nothing is wrong?  Well, okay, I know that's naive, but still.    I just came back from the dentist... AGAIN ...I finally got that cleaning I wanted.  My teeth look all nice and sparkly, but I may have "a cavity or two" in the back.  He didnt really check, because I have to go back next week and have him look at my guard to help with my incessant teeth grinding... so I guess I may have a filling "or two" to look forward to as well.  (sigh)  It seems that I should have looked into this teeth grinding problem earlier because it has caused bone loss, a mild infection in my gums because now I have gaps where the plaque can build up, and other shit...and so on and so on and so on.  It's like never-ending!  And its not like I havent been to the dentist in  forever , its just been 2 years, so what gives, man???  Can all this happen in the span of 2 years?  And if so, who or what is to blame?  Because really, I've never been happier in my life!  Then I think, all of this is so minor compared to dealing with Chemotherapy or something, which a friend of mine is going through right now and is taking it VERY well.  Still has a sense of humor and everything.  So really, who am I to complain.  At least its not root canal, though I can totally see the dentist saying I need  that  next too!!  argh.

        Talked to the Advisor today and checked online about Graduation.  GRADUATION FROM COLLEGE.  I thought this day would never come, but its only a month and a half away and I'm getting nervous!  Nervous excitement, but nervous nontheless...  I am going to pick up my cap and gown today and find out about getting a yearbook or getting pictures taken with books behind me (making me seem studious or something) and should I get a class ring?  Naaah.  Well, maybe... but I'd rather use the money to get pretty plants put into the front yard, y'know?  Its hitting me and yet it hasnt hit me yet.  I think I'm going to cry at graduation.  For sheer relief that its over.  Of course, then I could get my Master's, but I'm thinking I'd take a break first...for  another  5 years perhaps...hehehe...

        So I got my hair cut after all.  Its about 4.5 inches shorter and it feels refreshing as all hell!  It was at that stage of growth where its all over the place, has no shape anymore and basically looks lost.  Actually, because I got this new guy at the old place, the price was a bit cheaper.  It was actually pretty funny.  I could tell he knew how to cut hair but didnt want to upset me by doing something wrong.  He was also fascinated by my hair.  Said I had great hair.  Actually about 3 people in the salon said that.  Aww.  It made me feel very special.  :-)  After the haircut, we went to see Kill Bill Vol. 2.  I was more than a bit disturbed by the S&M undertones (overtones?) it had.  Bill was Uma's "master" then gave her away to "serve" under another man and do his bidding?  Okay, so the guy was training her, but he was also torturing her.  It was all so  sick ...So very...  "Story of O" ... and I still to this day cant say whether or not I liked that book, nor can I say whether I liked the movie...yet.  I think it needs to marinate in me for awhile.   Diane and I were talking about it today and we both agree.  Its misogynistic, and yet, because the woman ends out on top in the end, it makes one  think  its not.  But how much shit does one woman have to go through, y'know?  I dunno... it just BOTHERED me.  But here's the best part of my day!!  Before the movie started I had to go to the bathroom.  So I get there, its empty, which seemed a little strange for a movie theater ladies bathroom, but whatever, no big whoop, I do my bidness... then I'm thinking... I know its been awhile since I've been in this theater, but I could have SWORN this bathroom was bigger.  Then I glance around my stall and I dont see the obligatory "sanitary napkin" can next to the toilet paper.  Then I flush, get up and start walking towards the sinks...when just then I notice it.  THEY WERE NOT SINKS BUT URINALS.  HEY, WAIT.  THAT WAS NOT A WOMAN WASHING HER HANDS BUT A MAN WHO JUST FINISHED PEEING AND OH, GOD, HOLY SHIT, I'M IN THE MENS ROOM!!!     The realization hit me in about .05 seconds and I dipped outta there before I think the man even noticed I was a girl!  HAHA  Thank GOD I didnt see his dingaling!    Anyone that knows me well, knows that when I have a destination, I have the blinders on, and its actually funny how it never happened to me years ago!  Its so classic that I would do this.  There have been times when I've walked right by my own husband on the street, with him waving his arms frantically and calling out my name!  HAHA    I went back to my seat cracking up, I tell Steve and what does he do? Shakes his head saying, "typical".  (see what I mean?)

        You know how you psych yourself up for something and then something happens to stop your forward progress?  Well the hairstylist is SICK!  I have now made an appointment with my old place in Brooklyn since we're going there tomorrow anyway.  SIGH.  I hate when I have a bug up my ass like this, because I'll do  anything  to just get it done, it doesnt matter WHO does it.    But what if it comes out bad??  Oh lord!!  What should I dooooo?

GO AWAY!!  I cant take it!!  (oh, I said that already. heh, heh.)  Okay, well I just wanted to tell everyone that I'm ready.  Sorry to all those who liked it long...all I have to say to them is,  you  dont have to live with it.  hmmph.

        Why the heck were the 3 greatest singers in the American Idol competition in the bottom 3?  Well, I'll tell ya, because people didnt vote.  And when they did vote, they voted for the WRONG person/people.    Okay, was it  me , or did it seem like the 2000 Presidential Election all over again?  What the fuck was that?!?    Sigh.  I think George and John are sweet, but COME ONNNN, this is a singing competition not some who's nicer competition!  And besides, the divas are nice too!  Fuckin' middle America and it's bullshit.  It's like deja-vu.  I should have voted.  Maybe my voice would have counted.    Sniffle.  Bye Jennifer!  I loved you when your hair was curly and you looked like you were wearing a spacesuit!!

        On another note, today is "Administrative Professionals Day" a.k.a. "Administrative Assistant Day" a.k.a. "Secretary's Day".    My boss was actually the one who pointed that out to me, not by giving me flowers or a card thanking me for all my hard work, but because he thought it was a bunch of bullshit but wanted to make sure I wasnt offended.  HAHA!!  I was like, "oh yeah, so I should expect my flowers when I get home?" and he just cringed.  I know he knows I'm not serious.    Actually, my greatest fear is that he (they) asks me to lunch.  I HATE lunching with the bosses.  Even when I get along with them, it just feels so strained and contrived.  I mean, if I'm truly myself, I fear I may lose my credibility or respect (because I curse too much or I say or ask something too personal).  If we both get along swimmingly, then they fear I wont take their demands seriously enough.  If we're both too stiff, it just makes for integestion.  I mean,  really , people...   I've been friends with my bosses before and its only ended up badly.  One was my friend and then he became my boss and fired me for a bullshit reason.  He took what I said to him in confidence - about hating my job - and used it against me when they were restructuring.  Like, "Well you hated it there anyway..."  No, motherfucker, I hate  YOU.   Then there was the bosses that I became friends with after I worked there.  One, I had a mini-crush on her boyfriend, not good when hanging out as he was very flirty in general.  Another boss I ended up sleeping with.  NOT GOOD.  (sexually AND mentally, ha!).    Now and again, I make friends with someone higher-up that I've worked  with , but never  for  and it becomes a beeauuutiful friendship, like Gary or Joe.  Hi Guys!!  [frantically waving]  But I digress. Where was I?  Oh yes, I got no flowers.

        I have come to the conclusion that I watch waaaay too much television...and yet, not as much as some, and I happen to believe that the quality of my television watching is better than some.  Hmmph.    Had a conversation this morning in the kitchen about how  Angel  is ending and I was proud to say that I really didnt - no,  couldnt  - get into the show after watching a handful of episodes even though  Buffy  was one of my favorites... I just felt that Angel was just not quite good enough or smart enough.  Buffy put it to shame.  It was exciting, sassy, kinda scary at times and overall, well made.  Angel wasnt/isnt.  Sue me.    Then we talked about  CSI  vs.  CSI: Miami.   Oh, it's amazing the differences between the two shows.  It was like CBS thought that CSI may be too educationally advanced for some, so they dumbed it down and changed the location!  Oh, and added David Caruso whom I frickin' HATE.  He makes my skin itch!  [shudder]  Anyway, so I thought, let me write out the shows I watch on a regular basis and you guys can maybe comment or give me suggestions for watching something good I may be missing...or try and talk me out of watching what I already do.  (shameless plug for comments)   Shows I watch religiously (when its in season of course):   1.  24  on Fox.  If you dont watch it, you should.    2.  American Idol  on Fox.  LaToya.  Fantasia.  Jennifer.  'Nuff said.  3.  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  on Bravo.  I just LOVE the Fab Five!  And everyone is always soooo happy afterwards.  That said, the evil part of me wants to see a homophobe on and see how they deal.  4.  Significant Others  on Bravo.  A short like, 6 episode season to test the waters, this show has me literally slapping my thigh and guffawing its so funny.  I cant wait for it to come back!  5.  The Apprentice  on NBC.  Yeah, its over now, but I didnt miss an episode.  6.  Survivor  on CBS.  Steve got me into it and now I'm hooked.  Allstars, baby!  7.  CSI  on CBS.  I just love this show.  Mainly because its not always cut and dry at the end.  They dont always get the bad guy, and that's cool.  8.  Joan of Arcadia  on CBS.  I think its the most emotionally realistic show out there.  9.  Monk  on USA.  So good that ABC wanted to buy it.  So good that USA wouldnt sell it except as reruns.  10.   The Sopranos  and  Six Feet Under  on HBO.  These shows usually have me riveted and then they leave the air for what seems like years and come back only to do it to me again.  Its the great writing is what keeps me hooked.   Shows I try and catch:   1.  Sex and the City  - On Demand.  I'm up to Season 4 and I watch episodes whenever I feel like it.  2. VH1's  Best Week Ever  - I catch it when I catch it, and I usually catch it because they rerun it all weekend long.  3. Reruns of  Buffy  on F/X.  If I get home early enough I can catch Willow going all badass because Tara was killed!  4.  Cold Case  on CBS.  I always seem to forget its on, but for the most part I like the show.  5.  Touching Evil  on USA.  It started off very well with it being written and directed by the Hughes Brothers, but now its starting to get a trifle predictable.   Shows I wish I watched more often:   1.  The Simpsons .  Still funny after all these years but I always forget to watch it.  I usually catch up on the new season in the summertime, when everyone else is showing repeats.  ha-HA!  2.  Friends  and  Will & Grace .  Both great shows, but I cant bring myself to change the channel from 2 to 4 on Thursday nights.  I usually watch these in reruns too.   Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?  And scrap that "You need to get out more" comment that y'all are thinking about saying because I KNOW that.  I'm talking about television right now, not me.  Hmmph.

        I know it may sound like gloating but I just love this suburbian life I'm living right now!!  I went home for lunch, grilled up a hotdog, watered the plants and my barrel o' flowers, looked at the budding trees and just kinda giggled to myself at how great my life is right now.  I mean, sure I have a spanish test tomorrow that I havent studied for, and sure, its almost time for my review at work and I'm a little nervous, and okay, so I'm a fat bastid now, but overall, I cant complain!     Life is goooooood...

        Oh! I totally forgot to mention that I'm now the proud owner of a Huffy bicycle!!  hee hee!!    And, no, that is not my current means of transportation because I got hit by an old lady and Steve wont let me have the car....shut up, Guy.  I know you're thinking something really snide or sarcastic...  Its so purty!  We got it at Target (Tar-zhaaaay) on Sunday afternoon! Now I just have to learn how to ride it.  HA!  Gotcha!  I  know  how to ride, sillies!    I totally felt like PeeWee Herman all polishin' the bike and talking to it, an' shit... pathetic!     Giggle!

        I'm irritable today.  Dont fuck with me.   My day is not going well...   While trying to put a little tube thingy into this spray can of compressed air, I leaned it against myself to get leverage.  Wouldnt you know it?  I now have a nice dark circle from the bottom of the can that didnt come off my shirt with rubbing.  Luckily I had a sweater.  It was 9:15am.  At 12:15pm, I got hit by an old lady (she  HAD  to be no younger than 80) while getting out of the parking lot after picking up my lunch.  The car was perfectly perpendicular to hers as she started pulling out.  So basically, no, I was NOT in her blind spot.  Of course she was wearing those big dark sunglasses that they give out when you have eye surgery, so perhaps EVERYTHING is in her blind spot.  Thank god Saturns are made out of some alloy that has flexibility to it because she didnt put a scratch on the car.  Scared the shit outta me though!!!  I was all honking and screaming, "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOOOOIIIINNNG!?!?!"  Then I realized she was ancient and let up.  Looked at the car, saw no damage and told her it was okay.  She looked totally lost.  She should not be driving alone.  And now, well now I'm dealing with my best friend's issues.  She is honestly the worst person for me to try and talk to when I'm cranky like this, because I'm not very helpful... I'm sorry, call me a bad person, but I just cant deal right now.  SIGH.

        Fox finally showed Tuesday's episode of 24 last night.  Good move on their part since they, HBO and CBS hold the Sunday night television crowd...  All I can say is OH MY GOD.  That episode literally fucked me up.  My heart dropped because it was so unbelievable.  I dreamt about it all night long.  And I never even liked the character, so maybe I felt a little guilty?  Ok, a little background for those who dont know, and a spoiler for those who watch the show, but didnt see it last night...  1. Jack Bauer (Keifer) is an agent of CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) located in Los Angeles.  Jack is a very troubled man.  His old partner went double agent a few years back and killed Jack's wife.  He's got serious issues and is even a recovering heroin addict (he did it to infiltrate a drug ring and got hooked.)  2. There is a European terrorist with a biological weapon that is a contageous virus.  He is using it against the President and the President has CTU working overtime to get this guy.    3. President Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) also has a history with Jack (Jack saved his life) and he tends to ask too much of Jack.  But whatever, he's the President.  4. Jack has a boss.  Ryan Chappelle (Paul Schultze) is a micromanaging asshole from Division Headquarters.  He disapproves of Jack and his 'rogue' ways.  That said, he helps out when he believes that what everyone is doing is right.  So basically the terrorist guy finds out that Chappelle is tracking a money trail that leads back to him and demands the President to have him killed within the hour.  What does he do?  Well he cant do much, this terrorist has 11 vials of this virus that he will let loose if Palmer doesnt listen.  So the President calls on Jack, the only man he knows who could do such a thing.  (i.e. someone who's fucked up enough to kill their boss because the President told him to.)  And what does Jack do?  Well, after a futile attempt by CTU to catch this guy before the hour is up, Jack is forced to kill Chappelle.  A bullet to the back of the head with him saying, "I'm sorry we failed you Ryan, God forgive me."  BANG!  My heart just dropped.  It was so sad.  Steve and I were speechless.  I'm tellin' ya, this bothered me so much that I had to go to bed!  Sigh.  Rest in Peace, Ryan.

        There are days when I truly love the suburbs.  Today was one of them.  Sunny skies, green grass, BBQn' in the backyard, and cool neighbors to shoot the shit with.    Today was a good day.  Took my best friend to Best Buy to get a new computer.  She knows nothing about computers and insisted on getting something prepackaged and ready to take home.  She expected she'd pay around $800.  I was like, "Gee, do you know you can get something for much less and it will perfectly suit your needs?"  She didnt care.  She wanted it NOW and so what if it has 160 mb of RAM.  She'll use it all up for sure.  mmhmm.   And no, I wont take the 3 year parts and services warrantee for another $100.  I think I can do this myself.  Wait...it doesnt come with Microsoft Office?  That's HOW much more??   RIGHT.    SIGH.  I may not know that much about computers but I do know when someone knows less than me.  I love her, but I hate the fact that she never listens to me.  Like, NEVER.  Maybe its my approach?  SIGGGH.  It was nice hanging out with her and her boys, even though they were about to have a shitfit in the store if we didnt leave when they'd had enough of mommy shopping.  And speaking of the boys, Steve had  his  boys over.  The Dungeons and Dragon's gang.  It was so cute to watch them talk about orcs, bards, clerics, ogres and the like as if it were totally and completely for real.  I cant wait till they come back.  I cant say enough how adorable they are!  Makes me want to have kids. (yes, I know EVERYTHING makes me want to have kids) but its that same sense of play and pretend, that sense of adventure that we lose as adults that they still are able to let out once in awhile.  A-DOR-A-BLE!!  Oh, and honey I was very proud that everyone enjoyed your adventure!  Go you!

        Okay I just found out that my boss, not the joker, the lawyer, but my DIRECT boss, is, according to him, "ULTRA CONSERVATIVE".  I was like, "NO!" he was like, "Oh, GOD, dont tell me that you're a freaky-deaky liberal or something..." and I was like, "I'm pretty far left, dude." and he was like, "Oh noooo!" and I was like, "Oh noooo!"  It was a fright fest.  Laughable, but scary nonetheless.  Then I pointed out that he cant be THAT conservative if he rocks out to Bruce Springsteen in his office when he thinks no one is listening.  Mmmhmm!  (shaking head in shame)  Maybe I can turn him around... we'll see.

        I didnt get to see the American Idol "lets see who gets kicked off" show last night because I was watching Survivor, but I went to the Idol's website and saw that it was JPL.  THANK THE LORD.  He kinda sucked ass bigtime.    Siiigh...so Bill won on the Apprenticeship with Trump.  I was a bit upset that Trump didn't choose Kwame because I felt that unlike Bill, he didnt wear his stress on his sleeve, and, like a good manager, he let his workers do their job without micromanaging.  In the end, I feel that Kwame and Bill should have switched teams.  One wanted micromanaging, the other didn't.  Each team did not cater to the leader's strengths.    Now, in all honesty, I think that a MAJOR deciding factor on Trump's part was the fact that Kwame didn't fire Omarosa.  Problem is, he was under the impression that he COULDN'T!  She blatantly lied to him, he knew it, but felt he had to work with it because he couldn't get rid of her!!  Now, that's just unfair!!    And was it just me, or did it seem at the end when confronted about her lying, Omarosa blatantly admitted to fucking Kwame's shit up because, AND I QUOTE "Mr. Trump, you hired me, then fired me, then hired me again, for no money, only to fire me?"  She had that frustrated look of, "Well, I  KNOW  you didnt expect me to just  accept  that, did you??"  She got straight up petty.  That woman has issues!  And on dateline they showed her hubby, who looks relatively normal, so what gives?!  Now THAT is a BITCH.  I've come to the conclusion that anyone that was a beauty queen has some serious issues.  I mean, you know the young ones are fucked up in the head as adults because their crazy-ass moms (or dads) made them up to look like cupie dolls and prance around a stage like I dont know what!  But the older ones?  What makes a person get into that?  I know many do it to pay for college (like Omarosa) but they've still got to be somewhat shallow and full of themselves, right?  It's got to fuck up their whole life (by crushing their egos) when they dont win enough... therefore they must have to take it out on the rest of the world.  Think about it.  Hence my quote of the day: "Hell hath no fury like a former beauty queen scorned."

        Oh, and ON A MORE FANTABULOUS NOTE...if my calculations are correct, today is my 3-year anniversary of my first date (!!) with Steve, a.k.a. Stevie poo, Steveums, Honeybunny, Sweetie, Cutie-Patootie, etc... Its very difficult to calculate the exact day because I was dating others at the time (ooh, scandal!), we werent serious, he broke up with me twice,  and  now we have the wedding anniversary that everyone remembers...  So anyway, a toast to us, [clink, clink of the plastic tumblers] the happy couple!  I love you babydoll! (OH! That's another nickname!)  :-)

        Stuck in over an hour of traffic on the way to class, but found a parking spot no problem.  (Ahh, a blissful end to a shitty ride...)  After class I was going to go see my grandmother and mother but when I called my mother said that granny was asleep and she was about to watch her novela.  (i.e. you can come over, but nobody is going to talk to you.)  WELL EXCUUUUUSE MEE!   So I went straight home.    Got home at 8:45.  Drove slow because the weather was so icky out.  (Couldnt drive my normal 75 mph on the highway home, grumble, grumble...)  I HATE driving in the rain and snow, and, lemme tell ya, if I was ABLE to skip class, I would, but this woman is relentless!!  a) I had to hand in the compositions from hell, b) she goes on and on about us needing to be there and c) she'll go through, like, at least one chapter a class,  in spanish , at top speed, so if I'm not there, there's no WAY I'm going to pass the quizzes/tests.  So, yeah, it sucks.  Saw American Idol last night on tape, but it wasnt too late to call in for my favorites.  Actually, here's a hint...EVERYONE calls right after the show is over, but the lines are open for TWO HOURS.  So I usually call after 24 is over and then I can actually get through.  ha-HA!  This time, 24 wasnt on, but like I said, I was watching it on tape.  Because LaToya was in the bottom 3 one week, I give the obligatory vote for her.  Even when she's 'eh', she's amazing.  And she's adorable, so that doesnt hurt.  I also voted for Fantasia even though the whole world is voting for her, mainly because she made me cry because she 'felt her song' and hell, she was SOOO GOOD.  Then I voted for Jennifer Hudson because I dont think people like her as much as they should...and lastly I voted for George because even though the song wasnt a great choice, he's just so sweet I couldnt NOT vote for him.  Sorry JPL, but you forgot the words to a classic, you looked extremely stiff up there, and even though everyone but Simon thought you were great because you were 'geeky, nerdy, being yourself' that doesnt work for me.  It works for me with Clay Aiken.  Amazing voice, geeky look.  GO AWAY JPL.

        Big shout-out to all the hot Cuban wives of Guy who work in midtown!  A'IIIIT!  If it wasnt for this certain someone who helped me with my spanish compositions in the preterite and imperfect tenses, I would not be writing right now.  Thaaaaank Yooooou!  Phew.  It's done.  Ain't nothin' like having almost 2 weeks to write something and waiting until the last minute!  On another note, I've noticed that me and a few of my friends seem to be finding shit out about each others' lives through our blogs but we never really email or talk anymore.  Is this what has become of us?  We've just bypassed the conversation and go to what we want to hear, when we want to hear it?  Guess so...  Almost time for class!  I cant wait for school to just be OVER and I can graduate.  My goodness!!  By the way, Graduation Party at my house on June 5th!!! (ish)...that is, if the grass has grown in by then...

        Rain, rain go away, come again some other day!!    Ugh, its totally gloomy out, the backyard is still flooded even though we did crazy work on it, and (YAWWN!) I need a nap.  Okay, so I still have a shitload of filing, 3 Spanish compositions to work on and stuff to buy at BJs and all I can think about is "I cant wait to see American Idol and 24 tonight!!"  Quentin Tarantino should be a hoot since he knows too much about music and is a huge fan of the show.  I love it when I hear that there are famous people out there that are as obsessive about certain shows as I am!!  I know, I'm a dork.  Shet ep.  It's movie song night!  That means SOMEONE will sing "Take My Breath Away" and possibly there'll be a really bad rendition of "Gloria" or "Maniac" and then possibly, who knows... Now is it songs from movies, or from movie musicals? Because that would just open the door to so many hits like "Hopelessly Devoted" to "Rock n' Roll High School"  Either way, I cant friggin' wait!!  Speaking of music, I got the new George Michael CD (it's an import),  Patience  (how ironic) on Saturday and I cant stop listening to it!!  I'm so in love with him, its crazy!  So far I LOVE about 3 songs on it, and I like most of the rest, but I think this is going to be like  Older , it will grow on me...   I was talking about this yesterday to a friend of mine...the CD...it's kinda  gay , if that makes sense.  I mean, overtly so.  I know he's out and all that, but I guess its just weird for me to hear shit specifically being sung to a guy, even though I know what he likes... There's even a picture of his ha-cha-cha boyfriend in the booklet!  Call me crazy, but it's very hard to picture myself as his girlfriend anymore.  The lust is lost for him, but the love still lingers on...(as it always will, George.  I LOVE YOU!!!! MARRY MEEE?!?!? oh, right, I'm married. Shit. oh well.)

        I have come to the conclusion that I'm not the biggest bird fan.  I mean, I think some are pretty from afar, but really they're all rats with wings, if you think about it.  Damn scavengers.  The only bird I like, and that's dead, is the chicken.  Because if you've ever been around a live chicken, they're not that nice... although their underbellies are really soft.  I know this because I used to take care of them in camp and we'd have to collect the eggs.  But I digress, this is not about the love of chicken, but about the dislike of almost all things birdy.  I've had a few incidents to help me assess my opinion and I will share them now...  Pigeons and poop issues... 1. A pigeon pooped on my hair while walking across the park one day with a cute boy.  It was very embarrassing.  2. A pigeon pooped on my friend's shirt, on the boobage area (which is rather large) on the way to school and she had to go through the whole day of school with a nasty stain on her shirt.  3. A pigeon pooped on my my little neighbor Jeannie's ice cream while she was about to lick it.    Seagulls and food... 1. My high school was very close to the Bronx resevoir where a bunch of Seagulls hung out.  They would constantly vulturize your food.  All watching you while you ate your lunch an' shit.  Hmmph.   2. While on vacation in San Diego, I decided to go to Sea World.  While there I bought a Churro.  Y'know, those yummy long donutty things?  About 5 to 10 feet from the food stand, while looking at the sea lions, a seagull came out of nowhere and snatched my churro out of my hands.  It scared the shit outta me.  3. While in Wildwood, NJ on a weekend getaway, Steve goes to the bathroom and has me watch his corndog.  I was sitting at a table.  I turned my back for no longer than a second, literally, and its gone.  Gone to the vultures.  Sorry, honey.  Other random birds and our back yard... 1. I see some pretty birds but the moment I see them eating the grass seeds, I hate them all. I want to be reimbursed by them.    2. The damn birds are all happy and chirpy at like, 5am...  What the hell is their problem??  3. There is just too many of them.  Damn woods!  Oh! But I will exclude ducks from my 'I hate birds' diatribe because I believe them to be cute.  Actually, I only like duck butts.  I know it sounds perverted, but I mean it like, a duck is in the water and then he dunks down to eat something like a fish, and their little behinds go up while their back feet paddle to keep them down?  You know,  that ?  Its hilarious!  I could watch a duck butt all day long.    I also adore geese (but not Canadian Geese, they suck) because of the movie Babe.  Yes, Babe is a pig, but Ferdinand, his friend is a neurotic goose who tries to be useful around the barn so that the farmers don't eat him.  He's very funny and therefore I cannot hate geese either.

        Things that go bump in the backyard...  1. Those damn birds that keep eating our grass seed.  2. The sprinkler that we can never seem to forget to turn OFF.  3. Squirrels that are mating (I think...)  4. Loose cats in the neighborhood that like to chase the birds.  (I would rather it be a dog, though...I much prefer dogs.)  5. Nosey neighbors  from two doors down and across the street  coming to see what you've done to the backyard and give their suggestions as to how we could have done it better.  Oh, although he used the excuse for coming over as him needing to drop something off, which he did, but why did he have to come through the back?  Why not, gee, I dunno...RING THE DOORBELL??  It freaked the shit outta me!!  I thought, oh here it comes, someone's coming to kill us on Easter Sunday and everyone is at church except for us heathens, so no one will hear our screams... oh, wait...its just Gary.  Anyway, on that note...Easter Sunday was good.  I got to see my cutie patootie niece who is just absolutely gorgeous.  I cant tell you how delicious she is!!  Even with boogers running out of her nose and yogurt all over her face, she's STILL cute.  Had dinner with Steve's family and as per usual got stuck in crazy traffic out there.  But all was well in Rau-land, and that's all that matters.  Today is Opening Day at Shea Stadium and Steve and a bunch of other pals and family are going to the game.  Which means I have to fend for myself without the car.    Shit, and I was sooo looking forward to going home at lunchtime and checking out Episode 37 of  Sex and the City  on On Demand.  I'm now up to watching Season 3, where Carrie starts dating Aidan and then starts cheating on him with Big, and Charlotte meets Trey and Miranda and Steve break up and Samanta moves to the Meat Packing Disctrict.  I cant say how much I love this show, and its even better when you dont have to wait a whole week for the next episode!  Lovely, aint it?

        Yeah so I wasnt able to see my friend afterall.  Seems She'd stretched herself too thinly and didnt realize it until it was too late...literally...  Honestly I dont think its too much to ask to not be "squeezed in" because to me, that's not really quality time.  I didnt have anything really specific to say to her, I just wanted to SEE her, y'know?  And the pressure of possibly having a time limit of what? like a half hour? was just too frustrating to me.    Okay, so She wasnt able to come to the house, so there went seeing the wedding pictures and the new house.  Fine.  Then She was supposed to meet me at Cristian's birthday party (I'd be 'double dipping', but I'd do it for her and B didn't mind) but that didnt happen either.  I got so annoyed that she wasnt calling me like She said She would that when She finally did call, I had nothing but anger, frustration and disappointment on my mind.  At that point it would definitely NOT be all about the love of two friends who hadnt seen each other in a while, so what was the point?  I asked her what her plans for the evening were and She had already made plans and double booked that as well.  (I wasnt a part of those plans, and although I was tired and frustrated, had she offered to have dinner with me, I would have gone.)  So basically She goes back today and once again, I dont get to see her.  And, no, I'm NOT PMSing (John!)   I've never left home and lived that far away that when I came back for a weekend or whatever, I would have to see all the family and friends I left behind, but I know many who do and it can be pretty frustrating.  I had another friend who moved to San Francisco and every time she visited it would be this whole mess of her trying to fit everyone in that sometimes she wished that she came to NYC on the sly and didnt tell the family!  I'm sure its pretty frustrating to try and be accommodating to EVERYONE but I guess I just thought I was one of the more 'important' ones to see.  Why am I always so disappointed!?!  Do I expect too much of people?  Maybe its fate getting back at me for not showing up or cancelling at the last minute back in the day...I dunno...I'm just sad.  On another note, Cristian's birthday party was fun.  I was a little worried about tension at the party since Mommy and Daddy are on the outs and kinda had the 'happy family' facade going on.  But I can honestly say they pulled it off.  Maybe it was the distraction of the kids running around like maniacs and stuff.  Kudos, B!    It's always at these parties that I catch up with B's family like her sisters and brothers and their significant others.  Actually, yesterday was the first time I actually had, like, a  long  conversation with her brother's girlfriend Lucie.  Not that I ever thought she wasnt cool, she's very sweet, I've always known that... but you know those things...lots of people, mingling... you never really get to  know  the person... Well she's cooler than I thought, which is um... cool...  Okay I say "cool" too much.  I've just noticed that.  Now its time for Easter Brunchy-Wunchy with the family-wamily.  YAWN.  Hopefully I can drag my ass into the shower before dinnertime, I mean brunchy time...  heh. heh.    Tomorrow I will go into details about the backyard, the plants we bought/are going to buy and the birds that are eating the fucking $30 a bag grass seed that we put down back there.  I have come to the conclusion that I do not, for the most part, like birds.  Actually, I think that will be the main topic of tomorrow's entry, witha sprinkle of grass seed for good measure.  :-)

        My GURRRRRL is coming to visit!!! YAYAYAYAYAY!!!  She's the coolest and I havent seen her in 40 billion years... or so it seems.  In actuality its been about 3 years.  She's never even met Steve!    Oh shit.  Gotta clean now.  But see, THIS is what I need.  A REASON to clean.  Now I'll kick ass!  Hey, its Good Friday and I'm at work.  What kind of blaspheming place is this?!  I think I need to boycott or something.  Of course the last time I tried to boycott not having a holiday off, it backfired on me... My old job used to give us Columbus Day and not Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday off.  So I made a pseudo-stink about it practically referring to the bosses as "racists".  What I really just wanted was an extra holiday off!  However, they thought about it, and decided that they'd give us the latter off, and take back Columbus Day as a work day.  SIGH.  I can't win.  On another note, I lost my virginity on Good Friday.  EWWWW!!

        I am literally sitting here SURROUNDED by shit that needs to get filed.  Don't ever work for a lawyer unless you're a masochist or obsessive compulsive (both of which I am NOT.)  The filing has gotten to the point of overwhelmingness.  (Yes, I just made that word up, AND?)  I have no idea where to begin!  So far I've organized it into piles.   Pile #1: Its in a folder and I know where it belongs, I just have to walk my lazy ass over there to do it. Pile #2: Its loose but I know where it belongs, see above as to why I havent done so. Pile #3: Shit that is labeled by the bossman, but I still dont really know where it belongs. Pile #4: What  is  this shit and where does it belong?!  Yeah... so basically I realized that all my problems stem from my laziness.  I think I took the fact that my dad called me "Princess" and "Muneca" a little too far.  I  must  have had servants in a previous life...there is no other explanation to the laziness now.  That's my conclusion and I'm sticking to it.  Hmmph.

        YAWWWWWWWWN.    Can't.  Stop.  Yawning.  Need.   Nap.  On another less sleepy note, I have to say that Cheaper by the Dozen was VERY cute.  I like Bonnie Hunt and the kids were adorable.  One kid was called FedEx by the others because he was so different from the rest that the FedEx man MUST have dropped him off at the house.  It reminded me of how my oldest brother and I used to tell my middle brother that my parents found him under the Brooklyn Bridge because he was too weird to actually be our BLOOD brother.  HAHAHA  Oh, (tear, sniffle) good times, good times...

        Phew, Latoya was crazy safe!  But poor, poor Camille.  I liked her, but she wasnt versatile enough and she knew it too.  She kept this pained face all the time like she just wanted to get outta there.  And then there's the crying.  I swear if I dont cry at least once a week at something on television there's something wrong.  Joan of Arcadia always works like a charm but it wasnt on for two weeks because of  March Madness .  This week it made up for the lack of crying by giving me at least two teary-eyed moments in the last half hour.    Sniffle.    So yeah, Camille... sorry sweetie, but Maui just aint big enough to keep you in the game.  Middle America is much larger which is why Johnny Redhead is still in the competition, and NOT even in the final three...  Sigh.  Time to watch Cheaper by the Dozen.  What?!  Sheesh.  It was either that or House of Sand and Fog and I wasnt in the mood to get depressed by a movie.  American Idol can be depressing enough, don'chathink?

        SOMETIMES having a house is annoying.  I LOVE our house but with a house comes responsibility that one never, EVER has to deal with when living in an apartment in the city.  So I'm just going to bitch for a hot minute about a few things that are hard for me to get used to...  #1 - Having one car in the 'burbs isnt easy.  This is basically annoying when the man is on vacation (like this week) and sharing the car is a necessity.  If I worked some place I could walk to, or take a bus to, it'd be different but my job is just a little too far away to walk and there are no buses that get here directly.  So either he has to get up early and drive me to work, then pick me up, or I take the car in the morning and go see him at lunchtime (no biggie because I almost always go home for lunch anyway, heehee) and then he drives me to work and does his thing... But STILL, its annoying to have to go through that.  Especially when this weather doesn't tell you how the day is going to get- it's cloudy, it's sunny, it's cold, it's warm.  UGH!  #2 - We have a damn big yard.  It needs a little work.  It's not even, so the hubby is going to till the whole thing over, add some soil to level it all out and put out the grass seeds to start the yard over all nice and fresh.  It's a big ordeal.  One does not have to deal with this in the city.  #3 - I do NOT have a green thumb.  I got a book on gardening which has become a really nice coffee table book but I have yet to bring myself to actually TOUCH the dirt.  The closest I've come to gardening is trying to get the leaves out from under the bushes.  (Do NOT get me started on how many frickin' leaves there are.  THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.  I rake, it comes back, I suck them up with the thingy, they come back.  They are the bane of my existence, I swear.)  So anyway there are flowers coming up that I guess were planted years before that are looking good but I have NO IDEA how to maintain them.  I give them a week.  I'd like to plant a garden with veggies and stuff but I have no idea how.  I wish they would just appear and take care of themselves.  You know...like pigeons...or LEAVES...  #4 - There is too much to clean.  I could handle cleaning the apartment but lordy lordy!  There are rugs everywhere and then there's all the bathrooms!  SIIIGH.  I hate cleaning.  It seems the more space we have, the more space we have to throw shit that doesnt belong there.  Why is that tape recorder on the couch?  Well, gee... I dunno... because that's where it landed when I emptied out my bag.  Riiiight.  Okay, that's about it.  There really isnt that much to bitch about. I mean, basically it's that I'm lazy as all hell and I like to complain.  Yeah.  Mmmhmm.  That's basically it.  I know, I know....there are children starving in China!  There are people who dont have homes at all, let alone complain about them!  Sigh...I'm a terrible person...  On another note, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CRISTIIIIIAAAAAANNNNNN!!!!!  He's 3 today.  Everyone wish him a happy birthday, thankeeverymoosh.  Three years ago today my best friend decided to have natural childbirth.  I left work to be there at 4pm (you know, to ask questions like, "so how does it feel?? while she gives me a look of "get the fuck out of here, you are no longer any friend of mine.") She didnt give birth until 4am.  I was very tired.  I'm sure she was too (teehee!)  Stayed up most of the night talking to her youngest (half)sister and shootin' the shit.  Getting to know her as a young woman and not the little 6 year old that punched my boyfriend at the time... but I digress... Wittle Cristian was born and he was so cute and fat!  Awww!!    An old friend may be visiting on Friday night or Saturday morning.  I havent seen her in forever.  I guess I'd better get to the cleaning, huh?

        I'm jumping on the bandwagon here (no pun intended) and I'm going to talk about the 10-year anniversary of Kurt Cobain's suicide.  A few people are talking about it in their blogs and I feel the need to give my own take on it.   Firstly I am so totally against suicide as an option for any sort of issue.  Maybe that seems simplistic, but I just think its the ultimate cop-out.  Like, dealing with your issues is just too much so you go and off yourself?  Okay.  Riiiiight.  Sorry, that just doesn't work for me.  Especially since he had a baby daughter.  What kind of shit is that?  How fucking selfish are you?!  How about DEALING with your problems?!  Getting help, maybe?  That shows one's strength in my eyes.  But maybe that's just me...  Then there's the drug addiction.  Some people say that if he weren't on drugs, he wouldn't be able to write like he did.  Oh, you mean like those drugged-out stream-of-consciousness lyrics?  Riiiight.  I dunno... I never quite understood why there was so much drug abuse amongst the grungies.  There is a whole album written in memory of the lead singer of Mother Love Bone who OD'ed (a fuckin' GREAT album by Temple of the Dog - members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam) and Layne Staley of Alice In Chains was found in a river: cause of death? OD.  Oh and then there was Shannon Hoon from Blind Melon.  OD.  And Kurt kills himself.  But he probably would have OD'ed eventually too.  I'm SORRY but he WOULD HAVE.  I mean, I had pain in my life too and sure I've done my share of chemical substances (not as much as some, but still) and I didn't go and start abusing HEROIN and whatnot!  There are SOOO many people out there that have been victims of abuse or have had a VERY hard life and they don't fall into that trap.  Then again, there are people with less problems who do.  What is it that makes people go that far?  But anyway, back to music.  I ain't gonna lie.  I liked hair bands at the time.  I didn't get into grunge until it was kinda popular.  Sue me.  I liked the whole "look at me, I'm prettier than you, (sometimes) wear more makeup than you, my hair is longer than yours and don't you think I'm SEXY?!" attitude that came with bands like Poison, Nelson, Bon Jovi, Tyketto (does anyone remember them besides me?!) and Slaughter (oh Mark...Mark, where for art thou Mark?!)  I was a groupie-without-the-sex even then.  My friends and I befriended a few local bands like Turi (a.k.a. Tom's River) and Finster Baby and felt sooo fuckin' special.  They used try out their new songs to me at 2am and I lived for it!  Sure the music was cheesy sometimes...SO?  But...okay, another confession I STILL listen to Turi on full blast...what-what?! ...I think the lead singer is a pool man now, tsk.  Well, a man's gotta make a living...  I totally agree that Grunge pushed the hair bands out and only the strong survived by cutting their hair and making music that people still enjoyed (i.e. Bon Jovi and Metallica) AND, like I said, I jumped on the grunge bandwagon too.  I realized that as cute as they were, the pop-metal-hair bands really didn't relate to me personally like grunge did.  There was a lot I was feeling that I couldn't express, so songs like Soundgarden's "Jesus Christ Pose", Pearl Jam's "Garden", and Alice in Chain's "Would" really moved me.  So I thank MTV for bringing it to the masses.  I would have never heard of them otherwise.  Okay, so I replaced a pin-up of Mark Slaughter with a huge poster of Chris Cornell...Yeah? AND?  He was a SERIOUS ARTIST, I felt his music, and alright, it just so happens that he's FINE AS ALL HELL!!  Grrrr...  But I digress... Now, don't get me wrong.  I liked Nirvana but a) I hardly ever understood the lyrics and b) I feel there were other bands that came out at the time that were not put on such a pedestal because their lead singer didn't kill himself.  I think the fact that Kurt was so destructive in so many ways in general and then eventually killed himself (in a very violent way, at that) made people remember him more than someone else that maybe, I dunno, died of natural causes or maybe didn't die at all...like Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam or Neil Young for cryin' out loud!  Is what is happening here the same old story?  You didn't care as much when they were around, but now that they're dead they were/are now Saintly in your eyes?  Go figure.

        This weekend I saw Gothika with Halle Berry lookin' ugly (or trying as hard as they can to make the woman ugly which is very difficult) and The Rundown with The Rock, a.k.a. Duane something.    I have to say I was relatively disappointed with Gothika because it's like everything I've seen before...it's  The Sixth Sense  meets  Stir of Echoes  with a little  What Lies Beneath  thrown in for good measure.  It was thrilling in some parts but on a whole it just didn't work for me.  And Penelope Cruz was in it for like 3 seconds, although the trailer made it seem like she was an important character.  PUHLEESE.    The Rundown, on the other hand, was quite entertaining!  The Rock is cute, clever and witty!  I think I have a little crush on him! (ooh lala) I guess I was happy because the movie wasn't trying to be anything but entertaining, y'know?  Oh!  And Stifler's in it as the guy who's being pursued.  He's funny.  What's his real name?  Sean somethingorother.  And dammit if he doesn't have a nice little figure on him! (don't I sound like a horny little old lady?!)  Sheeeeiiiiit!! I forgot to promote my brother-in-law's show,  ANIMAL FACE OFF!  on The Discovery Channel.  It was on last night.  Hey, if you catch reruns he's Dan, the cute marine biologist who talks a lot of smack about how Sharks are the 'ultimate predator' and all that.  He's in Shark vs. Crocodile and Shark vs. Hippo.  Different types of sharks, same smack talkin'... :-)  And speaking of television *which I KNOW I watch WAAAY too much of* I have come to the conclusion that my favorite show of late is, hands down,  Significant Others  on Bravo.  It is soooo fuckin' funny that I almost pee my pants laughing every time I watch it.  Three couples are in therapy, all have been married different amounts of time and it's just them talking about their problems and then it goes into their lives outside therapy and I mean, I cant even explain how funny it is.  Like one couple has been married only three months and its obvious that they didn't know each other that well before getting married and the husband freaks out when he finds out she's slept with like, 200 guys... yeah, its like that.  Okay, maybe you just have to watch it for yourself to get how funny it is.  I'm definitely not doing it justice.  Anyhoo, that was pretty much it for my Sunday.  Never did clean that bathroom... heh.

        Last night I wanted to  see Louder than Words at the BPC but we had a prior engagement so we were not able to go.  Sniffle.   Louder  seems like its getting off to a nice start and I truly enjoy Bassey and Patricia Smith!  I REEEEALLY wanted to go though and I even asked Steve if we could change what we had to do to another night but we couldn't.  What we had to do was go to a student's play at John Jay college.  I was like, 'oh god, its going to be boooriiiing' but in actuality it was a moving, darn good play!  It's called ReVisions and it was done by City at Peace New York.  City at Peace is a  "dynamic, year-long, youth-led, youth development program that works with extremely diverse groups of young people, ages 13 to 19, using an innovative creative process to explore and address the complicated forces and events (e.g. racism, sexual discrimination, abuse, homophobia, violence, drugs, emotional distress) that they encounter on a daily basis..  The process helps them to solve their conflicts without violence and build long-lasting relationships.  They gain understanding and compassion across racial and cultural boundaries, cultivate leadership skills, learn to take active responsibility for their communities and in doing so, enrich and enhance their lives and others, breaking down boundaries in pursuit of a city at peace."    The show had about 50 kids in it, all colors and ages.  The story and songs were written by the kids and are based on their real lives (although they weren't necessarily playing themselves).  These kids put on a two hour show and kept us riveted the whole time.  What was sad was that the stories (all intertwined using a school as the main setting) were all true.  One story centered around 2 kids abused by their parents.  Another 4 girls were lesbians who are outed but aren't quite ready for it.  Another is about a girl who works, has to take care of her 3 siblings and grandmother, has a job to help her mother and is struggling in school.  Another boy's mother dies just as he's accepted to college on a full scholarship and falls into drug abuse to deal with his loss.    I cant say it enough.  It was all so moving because it was real.  That's what made it so scary too.  How easy is it to fuck up our kids?  How would I deal with a child being gay (I think I'd do ok, but who knows when its your own kid?!)  This happens all the time, and we don't really notice it because so much is not discussed. So much is shoved under the carpet.  So many kids are fucked up and we don't even realize how bad it is.  I mean, I know a boy who fell into the trap of drugs and whatnot when his mother was dying.  He always had to be 'the man' when his mom was around, taking care of his brothers all the time, he always had to be responsible for everything... and when he knew she wasn't going to be around anymore, I think he just freaked out and couldn't handle any more... I have no idea where he is now, all I know is that he kinda sorta ran away... I sure hope he's ok...  Y'know at the beginning of the show, the head of City at Peace made a speech and she said that this year, they only had space in the program for 60 kids and they had to turn away at least 100.  That means that there is a program to help kids, but the kids who need help cant get it because there's not enough funding for great programs like this.  Please donate if you can, in ANY way possible to City at Peace or programs like it.  www.cpnational.org/ny . Also, the show is still on - tonight and tomorrow at 8pm.  Tickets are $30, money well spent.  After this, they tour schools and such to get the word out.  ...After the show, we saw a few more of Steve's students who came to support their friend.  Steve was the only teacher that showed up.  I knew she gave the flyers out around the school and it was disappointing to not see any other teachers there...hopefully some will go to one of the other shows(?)  I think its great that Steve cares so much about his kids.  Its teachers like that  make a kid feel like they count... and I'm not just saying that because he's my husband.  I truly believe that if you show you care, you can make a little difference now and then.  Natalie, you and your cast were amazing!  Keep up the good work!!

        I'm going to BOLD all this text and see if it makes a difference - I think the font on this blog is a bit small, but I couldnt change it.  C'est la vie...   C'est la vie, (c'est la vie!) that's just the way it goes (that's right)!   It's a grey day in the tri-state area and its making me not want to do ANYTHING.  You know that feeling?  Where you have a lot of stuff to do, but absolutely no desire to do any of it?  Yeah, that's me.  Bleh.    Actually, I'm having one of those "I dont feel like doing anything all weekend" moments.  I think I'm going into shut-down mode.  I get like this when I feel like I have a lot on my plate.  Its like looking at a really messy house and wondering where to start, so instead of starting anything, you sit in the filth and see what's on TV...and then you watch something really dumb just to avoid doing anything.  Like maybe watching Judge Dredd or The Fabulous Life of... (back-to-back episodes, rewatching a few for the hell of it).    Actually, I have a (not so-) secret love of that show.  I love how these celebrities buy pants that are $400 but look like they cost $12.  Or Li'l Kim and her tacky ass.  Am I the only one who wonders how she has so much money to shop an' shit? I mean, does she have hit albums?  Is she even remotely talented? I dont think I've ever heard any of her shit.  School me, please, 'cause I just dont get it.

       1. Still working on the format of the blog, but for the most part its the way I want it.  I have to (obviously) change the profile thingy but I dont know how.  Diane, where are you, oh guru of the blogskin?  2. Last night I watched American Idol and was extremely disappointed in America's voting choices.  Why in the hell was LaToya in the bottom 3?!  Is it because everyone assumes everyone else is going to vote for her so you give your vote to someone like John Stevens or Camille?  I think John is so sweet, but he's not very versatile.  Neither is Camille.  She has a weak voice, but then again that never stopped Janet Jackson from being a star...    Now, ok so I didnt vote for anyone.  Sue me.  I just hate having to vote for all these different people.  Why cant we just vote for who we DONT want.  Is that so difficult, people?!  How much more money would they lose?  The only thing they charge for is the text-messaging thingy, but really, how many people vote using text messaging?  It takes too long!  SIIIGGGH.  So anyway, Amy is gone.  I think it was the hair that did it.  She can sing, so it must be the hair!  But it seems that everyone with pink hair has never gone past a few weeks on A.I.  Yup Yup.  But I digress.  From what, I dont know...  3. Who saw 24?! Questions:    3a. Please tell me why President Palmer is annoyed with Sherry when he KNEW she was a crazy beeyotch?  Isn't that why he called her in the first place?  To 'take care of things'?      3b. Is not giving someone their pills while watching them have a fatal heart attack... is that murder?  I dont think so...    3c. Am I the only one who can help but not take Gael seriously because Jesse Borrego was        i.) on Fame        ii.) a transvestite in I Like It Like That and        iii.) has a funny hairstyle?  4. Saw "Something's Got to Give" last night.  Steve kept going "EWW, OLD PEOPLE KISSING!  EWWW OLD PEOPLE HAVING SEX! EWW JACK NICHOLSON'S ASS!"  but overall it was a cute movie.  I think it could have ended better, like Jack ends up with no one but this is a big Hollywood movie so of course Jack gets the girl.  5. No school for a week and a half!  YAAAY!  I was so proud of myself yesterday in class, I kept shouting out the CORRECT answer to things (a feat for me in this class)!  I think Profesora likes me.  Schweet...   - For those who dont know me, I'm taking Spanish 321 - Spanish Grammar and Usage...or what I lovingly refer to as THE SPANISH CLASS FROM HELL.  It's a more advanced Spanish class than what I'm really supposed to be taking because its the ONLY thing I need to graduate and the class I'm really supposed to take was only offered during the day.  So I begged and pleaded for the Dean to put me in the CLASS FROM HELL so that I may graduate this year.  Ok, sure I'm Dominican, but I really dont speak Spanish very well and never learned it as a kid.  Now I'm working on problems with Spanish grammar and usage.  I'm learning shit that I dont even know in ENGLISH!  Oh, and did I mention the class is taught entirely in Spanish.  Yep.  Uh-huh.  Riiiiight.  I'm actually surprised at how much I actually understand the teacher.  Maybe I'm getting used to her.  3 or 4 people have dropped the class so far, but I'm still there.  Hey, that's commendable!  [patting myself on the back]  6. Called my mother last night and she was mad shady to me.  Maybe its because she's tired, but what the heck did  I  do? Sheesh.  My brother took the phone from her and was like, 'Mommy's actin' up, yo.  Dont listen to her.' So I hung up.  Lets see how long it takes for her to call me and act like it never happened.  Seriously, she's frickin' weird.    7. Saw my granny.  She doesnt look well, but she's still going, which is cool.  Hopefully she'll go home today. She likes being home.  I think I take after her.  8. I debated sharing this but its too cute/sweet not to.  This morning when I got to the car there was a card taped to the steering wheel.  It was a little lovey dovey card from my cutie patootie saying (paraphrasing) 'chin up, I love you and always will' What-what?!  Pffft.  That's right, I have the best hubby on the planet.  YAY, ME!

       Setting: It's morning, 8:45am in the kitchen/cafeteria of work.  Dyanna diligently makes her coffee juuust right... Enter Boss.  Boss: "There you are! Can you please work on that memo that I left on your desk with the back-up and the dictation...I need it by 9am."    Dyanna: (Nervous) "Um...I didnt see anything on my desk...I'll check again..."   Boss: (Stiffly) Well it's there.  Dyanna: Okay.  Exit Dyanna.  Setting: Dyanna's desk piled high with filing that she's been avoiding for months and can never find anything when asked since most of it hasnt been put away yet.  Enter Dyanna, frantic.  She picks up papers strewn about but cannot find anything to which her boss speaks of.  Slowly she turns and looks at the Basset Hound calendar with the really cute puppy of the day.   APRIL 1 . Realization hits her and she smiles.  Starts dialing the numbers to the kitchen extension.  Boss: Hellllooooo?  Dyanna: Is this some elaborate April Fools joke?  Boss: Maaaaybeeee...(chuckle)  Dyanna hangs up on him, laughs to herself.  THE END

        I don't think I can express my love for him in words.  A die hard fan till the end is the best way to explain it.  Will I stalk him, no.  Do I need his autograph, no.  If I ever saw him walking down the street, I would MAYBE stop him and tell him...hmm... what? I don't really know... I mean I wouldnt want to seem gushy, but not aloof either...   Aside:  One day I was in the Village with my best friend and I saw this guy walk across the street and I joked to her, "Oh look at Lenny Kravitz over there" and my friend, who is blind as a bat says, "That IS Lenny!!"  This was about the time when his second album  Mama Said  came out.  So he stops right in front of us and starts talking to the street vendor while my friend and I debate on whether or not to speak to him.  The vendor overheard us and she goes, "Hey Lennie, these girls want to talk to you." And so Lenny turns and smiles and I say to him, "Hieee! I have your first album, it's really incredible, I love your work, truly..." And he's all gracious and is like, "Thank you very much." and then my friend says to him, totally gushing, "OH MY GOD YOU'RE SO GORGEOUS!!"  He was really nice cause he thanked her, but I was soooo embarassed!!  I also used to meet celebs all the time when I worked retail on the upper west side...and that was cool.  I mean, they're just people, y'know?  But see, George is up there on a pedastle... So my point is, I know I'd try to be calm, but it'd be difficult.  I'm just glad he was only on TV yesterday because I had a smile from ear to ear that was embarassingly cheesy.  So ANYway, George was on Oprah yesterday - his first American interview in oh, 10 years or so and he did it with wit and grace.  It was so cute, I actually watched it when they reran it on channel 55 at 7:00pm.  My mother called me frantically to tell me it was on too.  She's cute.  She understands my obsession.    His hottie boyfriend was on too.  George talked all about the scandal and what occurred and why he ended up dropping off the scene and then he said something so amazing... When asked about whether or not he was worried about how people will react to him and how his sales would do being considered a 'gay' artist, he said, and I'm paraphrasing here, "You know what? I live a very good life.  I have everything I need and I dont really care if someone doesn't want to buy my album because I'm gay. I don't  need  them to buy it."  I was all like, 'YEAH, MAN!  YOU TELL 'EM!!'  Then he sang 3 songs and I wanted to cry.  I really hope he tours soon.  I don't think I can wait.  I really hope he doesn't charge like, 50 billion dollars for the tickets.  I don't want to pay that much, but I will fuckin' put a second mortgage on the house if I have to to see him in concert.

         Last night:  No this mothafucka did not lean his body all over my dirty ass Saturn groovin' to the Merengue playing on his boom box that he  conveniently  placed on TOP of my dirty car and did not move right away when I came towards the car and glared at him.  So you know my blood was boiling, right?  His friend at the corner saw me coming, though... mmhmm... I had the obligatory "OH NO YOU DI'ENT MOTHAFUCKA" look on my face when I said, "UM, EXCUSE ME?!?!  BUT DO YOU MIND NOT MAKING YOURSELF AT HOME ON MY CAR?!?!?!"    Motherfucking fuckers!!  I mean, HOW DARE HE!?!  I swear I almost took  urlLink The Club  and beat him over the head with it.  I think he could tell I was about to hurt him cause he backed away slowly and apologized.  His friend was like, "Oh, SHIT, yo!  Oh shit!"  Dumbasses.  Also, on a lighter note...  "Summertiiiiiiiime and the livin' is eeeeaaassssyyyyyy..."   If Fantasia doesn't win it will be a travesty.  I tried calling a billion times but all the lines were busy.  Hmmph.

        So WWJD is a saying that good Christians use as a mantra to live by.  It stands for What Would Jesus Do?  i.e. Live like Jesus and all will be good in the world...or some shit like that.  But, see, I'm not a good Christian so I'mo change that shit up for today to: What Would JACK Do?  Jack being Special Agent Jack Bauer, Head of the Counter Intelligence Agency for the United States.  Sorry, are there others?    So lets see... we've seen Jack pick up a heroin addiction to get an 'in' with the drug lords... He has been tortured to the point of death (see Season 2), he's been shot at numerous times, his daughter was kidnapped, his wife killed by his old partner who turned on him, his last girlfriend was also killed trying to save his partner from torture, um... oh yeah, his partner got tortured and he saved him, he had to KILL another agent (see one of my previous blogs) because a terrorist willed it so, and lastly he had to chop off his partner's hand.  Why?  Well to save the country, of course.  Well a few things happened to save a Presidential Candidate, but still...  So basically, yeah, 24 was really f'in good last night!!  The biting the pillow because you know what's coming next (see above about chopping his partner's hand off), and the Gasps of disbelief about it all.  Gael is dead.  The President's wife is dead.  The terrorist is dead.  For now, Chase is handless, Tony is going to jail for treason after saving Michele who should be dead because she was exposed to the virus but turns out to be immune, then gets kidnapped and he tries to break her out.  Um, yeah, the show is kinda jammed packed with shit.  But you know what really got to me?  After everything is all over and he 'saves the world' so-to-speak, he goes into his Ford Truck (yes, even 24 has product placement) and fuckin' just starts breaking down.  Like, the kinda breakdown that's worthy of an Oscar (or an Emmy).  So of course, you know my ass was bawling too.  I mean, hell, it was a long fuckin' day for the guy!  Of course it didn't last that long because he was being beckoned to debreif some mo'fos somewhere else, but it was quite poignant if I do say so myself.  sniffle.

        Today should be a National holiday.  I am officially renaming May 25th as the " I Do NOT Have to Take the Spanish 321 Final Day ".  Hehehehehe  This f'in rocks.  I'm overjoyed!  I's be a gradjumacatin' studint!  Of course, I was on a three way call with my mother and my aunt last night and my mother goes on and on raving to her about her "super-smart daughter who was able to pass the VERY hard Spanish class" when my aunt stopped her dead in her tracks and asked, "So can she speak Spanish now?!"  Heh.  Um.  No...BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.    Riiiiight.

        Totally unrelated, but I was watching  urlLink 60 Minutes  last night and Ed Bradley did a show on  urlLink Stanley "Tookie" Williams , an inmate at San Quentin prison who was the leader and creator(?) of the Crips gang.  It seems that Tookie has been writing books for kids on how not to get caught up in gangs and such, and the ramifications of it all.  He uses his phone privileges to call schools and talk to the students about gang violence.     Twenty years ago this man brutally killed 3 people (2 elderly) and sits on Death Row but he never actually admits to his guilt on the murders...  He's exausted almost all his appeals and may be put to death by next year.  However, the state says they'll change his sentence to 'Life in Prison' if he cooperates with a 'debriefing' - basically giving up some of the methods the gangs use for the gun and drug trade and such.  Tookie says he has nothing to tell because he's been in jail all this time.  He also talks about the honor code and not wanting to break it.  But really, if he's totally renounced the whole gang thing, why's he holding back at all, right?    What's even more fascinating is that he is up for the Nobel Peace Prize for all his work.  (he was also up for one about 5 years ago but didn't win.)  They say that it's not about what he's done in the past, but about what he's doing now.  True, true...but I still think that holding onto information because of the code of honor he took a long time ago is bullshit and that he doesn't deserve the honor bestowed on him unless he's truly let go of all his ties to the gang.  What do you think?

        Friday was a pretty good day. I found out for certain that by passing my Spanish class, I can now graduate.  Yay me!    Friday was also the third installment of  urlLink Louder Than Words  at the Bowery Poetry Club.  I almost didn't go because Steve didn't want to go with and I hate having to sit alone but then I remembered I was going there for a  urlLink friend , and I'm sure I'd know at least ONE person there.  Thanks  urlLink Diane !    In my humble opinion the show started up a bit rocky.  Eric and Guy started debating the war, and then a slightly looney woman started arguing with them from the audience.  Now, audience participation is great, but this debate went on too long and the woman was too long winded.  Then Guy changed the subject back to Slam and Nationals and such.   urlLink RAC  and  urlLink Keith Roach  were the special guests and they both did two pieces each.    Problem was, there was no segue.  They went from debating the war to RAC doing a poem that had nothing to do with war.  It didn't quite flow as well as it could have...BUT they still made it work.  It was very cool to see RAC up there with her bold personality and Keith all laid back going back and forth about Slam, and actually arguing about Group Piece poems and the new format of the slam competition.  Also, the addition of  urlLink Cristin O'Keefe-Aptowicz  as a co-host was cool too.    Actually, I commented on something! (and I'm actually glad that the wireless mic wasn't working because I didn't really want to use it...) RAC was talking about how at National's the Urbana team will do whatever pieces they want to do instead of playing to win.  I asked, "Are you sure that EVERYONE on the team feels that way, because I know Taylor plays to win."  I was under the impression that  urlLink Taylor Mali , even if he's not on an Urbana team, coaches it no matter what.  They set me straight right away!  Sadly, it seems like some people on the Urbana team get overshadowed by other members, sometimes even if they aren't even ON the team, so this year they want to make a statement to show off who they are and shine out there at Nationals.  Kudos to them.  I really hope they are able to win this competition solely on merit and not because of gimmicks or putting the highest scoring poet up using an old piece or something.  I thought the mix of everyone on stage really worked once they started talking about the scene and whatnot, and I liked the debate they had going about the war...however, I felt that it should have been one or the other...I really hope Guy keeps doing this.  It's a great idea that will find its way soon enough.  He's talking about the next show being co-hosted by  urlLink F. Omar Telan  and  urlLink Bassey Ikpi .  I think that would be a hoot, and I'm actually looking forward to it!

        I'm officially renaming May 21 to "It's all about love" Day.  What do you think?  I mean, I think it needs to be said that there are so many people out there, opening their hearts, despite the possibility of breaking hearts, cheating or a failed relationship.  I think we should give it up to those people.  The kind of person who loves unconditionally, and leaps head first without checking to see if someone will catch them on their decent.  I am one of those people, and anyone who knows me for about 5 minutes knows that I've fallen to the point of no return.  It's all good.  He loves be back...but I know that sometimes I scare him with how much love I have.  I don't care, though, 'cause that's the kinda gal I am.  :-)  Here are some others:   urlLink Taylor Mali  spoke of one in his journal the other day... "...the highlight of the entire weekend for me (and most everyone else at Breadloaf) was listening to one girl's love poem. I double-dared her to read it directly to the boy at the conference who she was crushing on, and she did. In the dining hall. At dinner. Through a megaphone. Breathless and aflutter. Surrounded by 300 kids and faculty. By the end of the poem, everyone was standing up on their chairs as she walked to the dumbfounded boy, his dinner tray in his hands. Who was this girl walking to him with a megaphone reciting a love poem in front of this crowd? He must have thought it was a practical joke. But every step she took closer to him was another step out onto the thinnest part of the branch. And the branch will not break. When she was done, to the deafening cheers of encouragement, they embraced and ran out of the room. I didn't see them again"   George Michael sings in his latest release:  "Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise / The day you walked in and changed my life / I think it’s amazing / The way that love can set you free / So now I walk in the midday sun / I never thought that my saviour would come / I think it’s amazing / I think you’re amazing..."   Cyrano de Bergerac recited this to Roxane:  "All, all, all, whatever that came to me, e'en as they came, I'd fling them in a wild cluster, not a careful bouquet.  I love thee!  I am mad!  I love, I stifle!  Thy name is in my heart as in a sheep-bell, and as I ever tremble, thinking of thee, ever the bell shakes, ever thy name ringeth!"   That's what I'm talkin' about, people!!  Go on with your bad selves!

        I've been taking a poll amongst a few of my friends as to whether or not I'm funny.  I happen to think I'm pretty darn funny yet many think I'm funny in the "shake your head - I cant believe she just did/said that" way of making someone laugh...  I kinda sorta disagreed, so I asked my oldest friend who's known me since I was six.  She also agreed with the "I can't believe she just did/said that" philosophy.  Hmm... maybe she's wrong too...   Then she points out the incident where I used nail polish remover on my face as an astringent.  NOT on purpose, of course...but yes, it's true...  Here's the story for all those already laughing and shaking their head in disbelief... I used to keep my  urlLink Sea Breeze  in one place on my dresser, the far right side.  My nail polish remover was always kept on the left side.  One day, my best friend and roommate at the time (what a mistake, but that's a different story...) decided to use the remover and put it back in the wrong place.  That said, one day we were just sitting and bullshitting in the house, and I went to my dresser to astringe.  Is that a word?  How about de-grease?  Ew, now I sound like an oven... Well you know what I mean...so I pull out the cotton ball and I dab the "Sea Breeze" on it and start wiping my face.  Here's how the conversation went from there:  Me:  Blah blah blah blah - sniff - sniff -  You doing your nails? Her: No...why? Me:  You don't smell that? Her: Nope. Yak yak yak.... Me:  Who the hell is doing their nails? Her: Maybe its the ghost. (giggle) [we did have one who used to make fried balogna sandwiches in her closet.] Me:  (Face burning - the lightbulb comes on...) OH MY GOD!  I'm going to die!! I'm BURNING!  It's MEEEEE!!!!  It's on my face!! Her: Falling down laughing hysterically Me:  Eyes watering, quickly runs to the bathroom to rinse face off.  So there you have it.  To this day it makes us both laugh hysterically!  (Totally cracking up right now!!)    Okay so maybe I am funny in a very odd way.  Siiigh.

        ...a older woman saying her name is "Dorann, like the group,  urlLink Duran Duran ?"  Me: (curiously)"Oh, spelled the same way?"  Her: (nervously) "um...no.  With an O"   Me: (friendly) "Oh. I was a major 'Durannie' back in the day, so I'm sure I won't forget your name now."  Her: (very nervously) "I'll take your word for it, I dont know any of their music, but I knew their name sounded like mine." Me: (smarty-pantsy) "Well, actually  they  didn't make up that name.  They got it from the film  urlLink Barbarella ...you know...with Jane Fonda?  '60?  Sci-fi?" (evil grin) Her: (hesitantly starts to sing the Beach Boys) "Ba-ba-baaa-ba-bar-branne..." Me: Right.  So? Coffee? (walking out of conference room)  I don't know what came over me.  She just annoyed me trying to act 'cool' knowing Duran Duran!  HOW DARE SHE!!  All's I'm saying is don't go comparing yourself to one of the greatest groups of the 80's if you don't even know their music!!  I mean, at least TRY and listen to ONE song.  Sheesh!!

        Sing it with me folks!  Doo-doo-dooooooo dee-dee-doo-doo-doooo...[singing the synthesizer in my head]  I took my final test today...not to be confused with the final exam.  After the test was over, she gave us the answer key to figure out how we did and to use as a study guide for the final.  I know I definitely got about 3-4 answers wrong and a partial credit on 2 others...But, if I remembered all my answers correctly, I may have pulled off a B on this test which  COULD  bring my total average up enough so that I would be able to opt out of taking the final after all!!  (crossing fingies!)  She took our email addresses and phone numbers to tell us our grades by this weekend.  I'll keep everyone posted.

        Okay, so popular consensus is that I need to shut the fuck up, suck it up and take the final.  It also seems that many believe that I'm not so special that I deserve special treatment.  That my Pass/Fail option is not a "get out of final free" card.  Well poo on you all!!  Actually, a little birdy put me in my place earlier this morning by basically pointing out that its all about my ego right now.  I've been put in my place and I don't like where I'm standing, so I'm pissy.  Hmm...maybe he's right.  But really, more than anything else...I'm f'in tired and feeling a bit lazy.  I want it all to be over today, not next week.  And I like to win arguments.  Okay, so maybe it IS about my ego.  Oh shut up!  Hmmph.

        Well, la profesora loca wrote back to me.  (I actually sent the previous entry as an email to her.)  In essence she said "tough luck and stop beggin'".  I know my school is in Harlem, but why'd she have to get all 8-year-old in the ghetto with me, man?!  Example:  Me: Hey that looks good. My brother: Yeah, you want some? Me: Sure, yeah! My brother: Stop beggin'!  BWAHAHAHA  That shit wasn't really that funny then and it ain't that funny now.  I'm depressed.  :-(

        Profesora,  I thought I'd send you this email to get my thoughts out without everyone vying for your attention after class...I know we talked a bit about the final the other day but I wanted to ask you again about it just to be clear and to 'state my case'.  I'm graduating this semester and this is the last class I ever have to take for my BA.  Because of this I took the class as Pass/Fail.  (I believe Passing is considered anything above a D)  I also believe you mentioned that if anyone had a certain average and completely bombed on the Final, that you would not count it.  Even though my average is not an A or a B, I can't see why I should have to take the Final. It doesn't really count for me in any direction.  A P is a P.  It has no value to my GPA except to show that I passed the class.  So basically, doing well on the Final or doing badly does not affect my grade in the class at all...  I try to be the best student I can in the class by participating, telling you when I can't make it, keeping up on the assignments - and I have definitely improved my grades from the beginning of the semester...so basically, I beg of you to let me out of taking the Final.  It would really lift a weight off of my shoulder.  Por favor?!  See you tomorrow,  Dyanna   So...whaddaya think the crazy Cuban will do?

        Hmm...is  urlLink Savage Love  pornography?  Should I hide the fact that I read it once a week at work?  Okay sure the ads for porn sites/magazines/downloads are prominent, but its not  REALLY  smut, is it?  Basically, one of these guys that works here asked me to check online for something then  came around  my desk (I hate that) to see what I found for him... meanwhile, what HE found was Savage Love.  (It seems the  urlLink Wall Street Journal  takes a long time to load up.  Dammit I knew I should have just opened up a new window!!)    Alright, YES, I read Savage Love.  SO?  He giggled and then stated that I have "too much time on my hands."  I tried to explain to him (while probably turning beet red) that it was a) not what you think! and b) actually a pretty funny column in The Village Voice...no really!   Ummm...yeah.

        I have a canker sore from hell in my mouth that kills.  I have psoriasis on a finger tip that is acting up bigtime.  That also hurts a lot.  Oh!  I've been clenching my teeth more than ever too AND my back is so tight it feels like its about to go out. I'm tense.  TENSE, I SAY!   All of this is caused by stress.  My body is going into breakdown mode.  Someone give me valium, STAT!   Pretty please?  With sugar on top?   Seriously, I'm worried.  I worry so much about so many things.  Like, things I have no control over, like my friend's lives...I sooo would take care of business that much better, but it ain't my life, right?  I also stress about my Spanish class.  It's down to the wire now and I am freaking the fuck out, yo!  I mean, I know I'm going to pass the class in the end.  That's not really the issue.  I guess I'm just nervous about what's next.  Mainly because I don't KNOW what's next.    Do I need to know what's next?

        Ain't nothing worse than getting a migraine... oh wait, there is.  Its having a migraine come along while you already have cramps. NIIIICE, right?  Oh, and then there's when it happens when you're at a kiddie amusement park with your best friend and her two kids on a sunny day with no pain killers in sight.  MMMHMM. (@#!$%*&!%?#!)  That was me yesterday.  Luckily the kids are semi-old enough to understand that Auntie DyDy needed to be alone for a while to get better before taking them home.  They played with the sidewalk chalk on the porch while I rested inside.  In the dark.  With a pillow over my head to drown out sound/light/the world.  Unfortunately I didn't feel better soon enough so Steve took them home.  I felt so horrible in so many ways at that point of the afternoon.  I'm lucky to have him, really.    Okay, shameless gushing of how much I love my husband...  I love that man more than life itself and I ain't ashamed to admit it.  He is the only man I've ever been with that all my friends adore.  He's hilarious, he's handy, he can talk about anything to anyone.  He's practical, and yet once in awhile will buy me flowers or a card, or spend on something frivilously just for the heck of it or to remind me of how wonderful he is.  Oh, and I happen to think he's adorable too...Even when he says he wore sunscreen and comes back with a face as red as an apple...but that's another story... I truly don't know what I'd do without him and hopefully I'll never have to find out.  EVER.    You're the best, Babe.

        On a more fantabulous note, CBS gave away another million dollars to America's Favorite Survivor.   urlLink Rupert  won and all was well in the world...   Now, it was all over the place that Rupert was America's favorite Survivor EVER.  So why even bother with having a vote?!  I mean, they may as well have handed it to him last week!  EVERYONE knew it'd be him, and rightfully so.  He basically did back-to-back Survivors and made it to the Jury both times...and he's really sweet under the Pirate's facade...  YAY!!  This  ALMOST  makes up for the LaToya loss.

        I totally went off in my last post but I deleted it this morning on the advice of a friend.  He's probably right.  Basically I was talking trash about people at my job.  Although I didn't say anything bad about my bosses - I actually really like  them  - I  did  use quotes from emails/conversations that actually occurred yesterday.  SIGH.  Y'know what, for the most part, this job is great and I don't want to lose my job like  urlLink she  did.  It definitely helped to get it out, though.  Thanks, O, for the advice.

        I lied.  American Idol sucks baboon's booty.    Flimflamfrenehfrenehfrizzlefrazzle...  LaToya doesn't deserve this!! I hope she gets a contract, sells a gazillion records and becomes the next Whitney Houston  sans  the crazy drug-addled trips to Jeruselem.  I'm in a very emotional state right now.

        I can't say enough how much I adore this year's American Idol.  I so look forward to Tuesday nights watching Fox!!  I mean, it's the same feeling of rushing home to watch MTV because they're going to World Premiere the new Duran Duran video.  It just  has  to be seen.  Tonight was disco night and unfortunately Jasmine sounded like she was ripping her throat out singing, she was so hoarse.  I tried to vote for the other three these past 2 hours but the lines were all busy.  Good to know.  Thought about throwing in a pity vote for Jasmine, but then I remembered the Jennifer Hudson 'nobody voted for the right people' fiasco and put the phone down.  24 was off the hizz-ook and I worry what I'm going to do with myself once this season is over.  Fa-sniffle ma-niffle.  On a totally random note, I finally used the  urlLink Gazelle Freestyle Trainer  we bought and it kicked my ass.  Owwie.

        Spring in the 'burbs aint all its cracked up to be.  Sure there are pretty flowers and greenery all around, but HELLO?!  The fuckin' storms out here are ridiculous!  Having a storm wake me up and KEEP ME UP is not what I would call enjoyable.  It happened again last night.  Maybe its just me.  But with these storms comes the paranoia that a tree is going to fall on my pretty little house or our dirty little car and we'll be left with nothing. Not to mention every time the thunder crashes it sounds like a bomb and when the lightning flashes through three windows on all sides!    Mommy, I'm scare-ded!!  No  seriously .  I was scared as all get-out!  I actually cuddled against Steve for emotional support, meanwhile all he's thinking - sorry - TALKING - about is, "I wonder if the yard is going to get flooded again..."  Needless to say I didn't sleep well and I'm a little grumpy.  Do these storms happen in the city and we just dont hear it because we're in these big sturdy buildings with no view?  Or does it just happen worse in the suburbs because of ozone levels or some shit?  This I ponder...

        So basically we did about 600 miles in the car this weekend, but I got what I've wanted since before we even had a house...a porch glider. (giggle)   Here's the deal.  I've wanted this for a long time.  Saw them in Amish Country (around Lancaster, PA) and they were well made and relatively cheap.  We bought a house with a porch where it would look so inviting.  We would not be able to fit one of those things in the car.  Steve PROMISED he'd get me one.  So we searched on the Internet, searched around NJ and everything we saw was either poorly made or cost too much.  So we decided to go back to Pennsylvania with a larger car and get real deal.  Getting the larger car however, was tricky.  It meant driving out to Long Island to get my sister-in-law's minivan.  We had to go there (about 75 miles away) on Friday night, drop off our car, take theirs, drive to PA in the morning (about 160 miles away), get the glider, drive back home, drop off the glider, then go back out to LI and come back home.  Oh, and yes, we got stuck in traffic through most of the 300 miles back and forth in LI.  It was not fun.  BUT, I have a glider, baybeeee!!  I even stenciled a nice design on it.  I love that thing.  Its the best!  I have the best friggin' husband in the world!!  He ALWAYS comes through for me.  (gush, gush)  Anyway, onto other things.  Wait a minute, there arent any other things.  Its all about the glider.

        HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!!!  Yeah, so its a Hallmark holiday probably created to help support the economy moreso than to appreciate mothers across the world, but so what?!  Mothers deserve a little something, a little more appreciation than usual on a specific day of the year.  Its like an extra birthday or something!  But if it wasnt for them, we wouldn't be here.    And that's the truth, Ruth.

         urlLink Diane's got a really hardcore blog entry today .   I feel her pain.  However, sometimes one has to be smacked in the face by something in order to truly see it for what it is.  As any of us that left or are still in the poetry scene know, its that there is an apparent heirarchy and an elitism not unlike High School.  Here is my pecking order:  1. There are the cool 'kids' that everyone wants to be around.   2. There are the newbies who are willingly kissing the asses of the cool kids but who will never become cool because they are not respected.    3. There are people that came onto the scene with awe, became accepted by their elders and then went on an ego trip never to come back.  4. There are also newbies that appreciate the scene and are doing well in it, gaining the respect of their 'elders' but not quite succumbing to the spotlight.   5. There are people that have been around for awhile, but have never quite have been accepted by the cool kids despite their efforts, or how many times they win a slam, they just can never quite get there.  6. There are people that were once the kinda cool kids that were actually nice to almost everyone then realized that not everyone was like them...they come out of the spotlight and move on to bigger and better things.  I tend to have more respect for the latter three.  Nothing is worse than being in a community that has a facade of being something it's not.  That realization can hurt like a motherfucker.  It's like, do you play the game and stay there, or do you walk away?  I walked away, but I wouldn't consider myself a poet or a writer.  I wasn't affected financially and socially when I walked away.  It wasn't my game to play.    D, I feel for you.  Let it all go.  Move on.

        Boring day, nothing to say... I think its going to rain on my commute to class...fuckin' wacky weather...  I hope LaToya and Fantasia got enough votes tonight to stay in the game on American Idol.  I felt bad that it was a night where John Stevens would have surely shined and he wasnt there to sing.  George didnt really do it for me, I think he may be the next to go.  24 fuckin' rocks.   I love in the preview for next week's episode where Tony says to Jack, "you may have been willing to sacrifice  your  wife for this, but I'm not ready to sacrifice mine!!"  That's a real low blow, man.  Jack didn't want his wife dead!  That was so mean!!  But anyway on another note... I have had a bruise on my leg for over 2 weeks now and the swelling has not gone down.  There's no discoloration, but the bump is still there.  I think I'm dying.  Should I get this checked?  It still hurts.  How can I make it heal faster?  I don't get it.  Ow.  Am I dying?  I think I'm dying.  And finally, I have a friend that's upset.  Two, actually...They've been wronged.  I think in some ways they have the power to do more about their separate situations, but they won't/can't/are not ready to...this I'm not sure of.  I do, however, know that I want to help, be there for them and all that, but I don't know exactly how.  I've advised them as much as I can about what they need to do, but they won't listen.   People already have their set ways of doing things, and set thinking patterns and I can't change that.  But in the meantime, both are miserable and both turn to me to listen.  Problem is, it is extremely difficult for me to listen without forming an opinion of my own and it doesn't always take their sides.  I am torn between taking their sides unconditionally (because I'm their friend and they've turned to me for whatever reason) and wanting to smack them in the face and say, "Snap out of it!" like Cher did in  Moonstruck .  ARGH.

        My friend can be so profound sometimes... While going over my little Dear John email fiasco with her last night, I asked her again, "But you didnt even ask me WHY I was 'breaking up' with you.  Why not ask why, since it came outta nowhere? Didn't you care about and respect the friendship enough to wonder why?"  And she said,  so simply , "Well, don't you think that if  you  cared and respected what we had, you wouldn't be ending it?  I had no place to ask 'why' since you obviously gave it enough thought for the both of us."  That fuckin' girl gets me every time, man!  Busts out with something that makes so much sense, while I sit here analyzing shit for days!    On another note, I was used as an example in my Spanish class.  A POSITIVE example, thankyouverymoosh!  I got a B (an 80) on the last test and I'm doing well on class participation (i.e. yelling out the CORRECT answers to her questions).  Profesora was getting peeved with the native speakers in the class that are not doing well AT ALL and she pointed out that I have brought my grade up from like, a D to a B and I'm not even a native speaker.  Of course she thought I was white, because of the last name and my fucked up accent... but that's not the point.  I'm NOT a native speaker and I'm kicking ASS, yo!!  Go meeeee!!

        This morning I decided to play a practical joke on a friend of mine.  The same friend who I didn't get to see when she was in town a couple of weeks back.  Well, after a wicked fight, some time to breathe and a make-up conversation, we started talking again.  However, every time we talked, I had to cut it short because it was busy here or other shit like that, and since I'm not used to calling her when I'm at home, I just kept forgetting to get back to her.  So this morning she sends me an email pointing out that the ball was in my court and why haven't I called her back the past 3 times I cut the conversation short... so I started writing an apology and then I thought it would be  funny  if I wrote that I didn't want to be friends anymore.  So I wrote out this whole Dear John letter to her, sent it, and then sent her an email RIGHT AFTER saying, "GOTCHA!  Sorry, I just got caught up over here.  Bad DyDy!"   So then maybe 10 minutes later I get a response to the first email saying, "okay."  As in, "Okay, I guess if you don't want to be friends then...okay..."  And then I didn't get a response to my second email at all!  So I started to get paranoid, like, "Holy shit, she thinks I'm serious!"  So I called her and I'm like, "Did you not get my second email?" and she says (rather curtly), "No."  So I'm like, "DUH!  I was  KIDDING ."  And she says, "Oh, then I apologize for calling you all these names in my head just a few minutes ago."  Then I wondered, why the heck didn't she want to argue with me about it?!  Like, what the fuck does "Okay" mean!?!  Does that mean our friendship means nothing?!  That she would give it up so easily like that?!  Flim-flam-freneh-freneh-grumble-grumble!    I talked to her and she pointed out that she just thought I was being a total bitch but she really couldn't stop me.  Couldn't  force  me to talk to her... I was like, "But this is  ME , you know?!  We understand each other! Sheesh!!"  She basically just stuck to her guns and pointed out that, yeah she thought I was being dumb, but what could she do?  Somewhat similar situation... This weekend I advised a friend to give something (someone) up for the sake of their own sanity, but then I realized that that person is a fighter.  Isn't willing to give up so easily for something they have such strong feelings for...  So basically, this all just got me thinking...what is actually worth fighting for?  And how would one go about it?  One can't really change another's feelings in general.  We are who we are, right?  But then again, what makes a person feel that something isn't worth it anymore?  When is it time to give up and when should we fight?  When should we just accept something and when should we point out what the other person is missing?  I dunno... these were just random questions going on in my head...  Oh, and by the way, after we laughed about the practical joke gone wrong, I had to cut her off again because I was being beckoned by the powers that be... heh. heh. heh.

        Things I hate about Washington Heights: 1.  Roaches 2.  Garbage on the street 3.  No parking.  EVER. 4.  The seven or 8 cab drivers honking at you for a ride in the minute it takes when you're waiting to cross the dang street. 5.  The music blasting out of houses and cars and the kids on the street until all hours of the night the moment the temperature goes above 70 degrees.  Things I love about Washington Heights: 1.  You can ALWAYS get a cab. 2.  Platanos are like, 6 for a dollar, yo! 3.  I know my way around and where to get the best a) chancletas, b) mangu, and c) cuban sammiches. 4.  My grandmother lives there and she's really cute. 5.  You can get your hair blown out for like, a dollar, an' shit.  And they do it RIGHT.  I'm on the fence about the fact that I woke up to a ROOSTER crowing on 173rd Street and Audubon Avenue... Those fuckers dont let up until the whole friggin' WORLD is awake!  I felt like I was on a farm.  Actually I think I dreamt that.    I realized yesterday that I truly grew up in the little Dominican Republic.  Half the people cant speak English, the food is great, and there are ROOSTERS in the friggin' back of buildings as if we were in  el campo .  What's funnier is that, as anxious as I was about taking care of my grandmother, I never feel weird going back to the old 'hood.  I actually kinda miss it sometimes... Shhh!  Dont tell anyone!

        I said to Steve a long time ago, "Do you think your students read my blog since my April 4th entry about ReVisions?"  (Since one of his students was in the show, he told them about my blog commending the show.)  I personally assumed his students would continue reading it from day to day.  He however, thought otherwise.  Well it turns out  I  was right.  Nyeh!  We just found out last night that Damaris Ramos (oh yes I did say your full name!) reads my blog.  How cute is that?!    A big shout out goes to Damaris, Valadictorian of the Coalition School for Social Change Class of 2004.  HEEYYYY GUUURRRRRRLLLL!!  (So you can comment now...)  hee hee!

        So last night was  urlLink Guy's   urlLink Louder Than Words  show, which I loved.  It feels like the end of a party when there's only a bunch of stragglers left, good friends mostly, and we all just sit around and talk about politics or films or careers, etc. before getting our asses home...  But last night I said something that I wanted to elaborate on because I don't think I got my point across well enough.  I commented that, as the consummate spoken word fan, I have been to a lot and have seen a lot - good, bad, what-have-you.  I said that the main reason people go to a slam or a poetry reading is to be entertained.  However, I feel that some of the panel members thought that I expected them to put on a minstrel show when they are pouring their hearts out... Not true.  My point was just that if a poet CHOOSES to get up on stage, it is their responsibility to try and give me a good show.  Whether that be making me laugh or making me cry, it doesn't matter.  If your words are incredible, but your performance is boring, I will be bored.  If I already have read your work and I know its incredible, then it won't really matter because I am already a fan of yours.  There was also a discussion about poets who manipulate by writing pieces that are not truthful.  Taylor and Bassey argued back and forth as to the fact that she demands more honesty and integrity from a poet vs. other art forms.  I agreed with her on this point.  If you love a poem and then find out that something a poet wrote about really didn't happen to them, it makes you like them that much less.  However, its a hard call...if a poet prefaced their poem with something, it would really depend on what they said, because if they stated straight out, "this didn't happen to me, I just made it up." vs. "I sat in my friend's classroom and witnessed her with the kids.  I wrote this  as  her." I would give more or less credibility and respect accordingly.  Then again, Steve pointed out that if it DIDN'T actually happen to the poet, wouldn't the fact that he/she was able to evoke so much from the audience make them THAT much better of a writer?  It's something to think about.  I can tell you right now, though...now that I know that about the one poet 'shouted out' last night, I don't like him so much anymore.  hmmph.  --------------------------------  After the show, I was talking to someone who said that I was a bit of an anomaly because I have always been a fan ONLY and never got up on stage.  It seemed as though they thought it was strange to constantly go to the shows but never have the desire to get up there because I was so inspired to do so...   Did listening to the different poets inspire me to write? Yes.  Did they sometimes inspire me to talk to the writers?  Sure.  Did I feel personally touched by some poems? Most definitely - that's what actually got me talking to Guy in the first place.  BUT did I feel like I needed to then take these written words and get on stage and share them with the world?  HELL NO.  a) because I did it for me, b) because I didn't think they were good enough to share with the world and c) because I have no desire for the limelight.  Believe me there were times I WISHED there were more people out there like me.  I know there are others out there that feel the same way.  I commend the fact that some have the balls to get up on stage, but we all know we wished some people would keep their shit to themselves!  Sorry, but its f'in true!  Let me give you a great analogy here...You have a favorite band.  You listen to their CD over and over and you see them in concert as much as you possibly can.  Sometimes they do new songs, sometimes the oldies but goodies.  Some of their songs are goofy, and some are very moving.  Some you feel like they wrote specifically for you.  You listen, you sing along even... but you don't go and pick up a guitar to emulate them.    Now, that said, if the band had not come out with a new album in years, and every time you saw them in concert they did the SAME SHIT over and over and over, you'd get sick of it too.  Oooh!  Oooh!  Even better, you get to meet the band and they're a bunch of cocky, pretentious asses!  Kinda ruins it, doesn't it?  ...But then once in awhile you go back because you kinda miss it.  And you liked it once, so it couldn't be SO bad.  Oh, and maybe they have a new guitarist who writes some new songs once in awhile, y'know?  So you and your friends can't quite quit cold turkey, but you can easily not go for a long-ass time and not feel like you missed that much.  So basically, to make a long story short, (yeah, right!) I am not an anomaly.  There are many people like me out there.  I was going to Bar 13 almost every week for about a year before I spoke to anyone.  I did it because I enjoyed it.  There are more like me out there and it is the poet's job to remember that we're there, and respect us as not only fans, but as people.  And yes, you will touch us with your words because there is that lonely punk girl out there that needs a little more inspiration than Avril Levigne, (hehe) and there are girls that just lost their father to cancer who openly cry after hearing about 'Gan'ganny's' breakfast...but there are also out-of-towners, and people waiting for their movie to start up the block, and daughters of bartenders and, well, you know what I mean.

        Lately life has been a little blah.  I think I'm still getting used to not having certain responsibilities and accepting others in its place.  Instead of studying for a test, I now have to weed the front yard.  Shit like that bugs me out sometimes.  Yesterday I must have gone into shut-down mode because when I came home I crashed.  Fell asleep for over two hours and forced myself up.  Of course by around 10:30 I was wide awake.  I was tossing and turning in bed almost the whole night until about 6am, when I finally fell asleep only to wake up an hour later.  NICE!  So now I'm extra-specially blah!  whoo-hoo!!  In case anyone is curious, through numerous conversations with people that love me, I was reminded that everyone will do what they have to in due time.  They also pointed out the obvious, that no matter how hard I try, I cannot live other people's lives for them...so STOP STRESSING!!  Therefore I have.  Okay, so I wrote another 'I love you but you're ruining your life' email to my friend that's been stressing me but then I deleted it.  heh.  It's good to know other people's passwords sometimes...  So here I am.  Trying to get up the will to start filing before getting fired over it.  Wondering when fun people will get on AOL IM to distract me... thinking about Guy's possible 'swan song' tonight... hoping I'll have fun.  Wondering if we'll do anything afterwards...blah.

        "This is going to hurt me more than its going to hurt you."  So I wonder who has it tougher when it comes to "Tough Love".  The person that's making the statement or the person on the receiving end?  I'm the one dishing it out (what else is new) and it's seriously killing me.  I feel like a parent who has to let the child 'cry it out' instead of giving them the bo-bo ('binky' to all my white peeps out there) or something.    I want to call but I know I shouldn't.  Or well, more like, I won't.  I  have  to make a statement.  What I worry most about is being misinterpreted.  I want this person to realize that I'm not trying to give the ultimatum of, "I won't talk to you unless you get your shit straight".  What I'm really doing is letting go.  Letting them work it all out, and me being around is too enabling.  I just hope they realize it.  So maybe right now I'm feeling a little guilty, and a little sad, but the frustration of someone fucking up not only their lives but the lives of their family is a much stronger feeling.  So here I am.  Alone on a Saturday afternoon.  Moping.  Not returning their call...  Like I said, I hope they get it... and maybe even decide to make some changes.  My love for them is overwhelming but I know I can't live their life for them, and its not in my nature to be a passive listener, so I'm gone... for now at least...

        Random thoughts in the shower this morning: Yess! I finally got the new Eddie Izzard DVD after going to/calling about 10 stores to get it.  I love Eddie Izzard.  He's so smart and funny.  I love Steve.  He's so smart and funny. I remember how I said on my Matchmaker.com profile that I would love to have lunch with Eddie or my father and how Steve wrote me back saying that he liked Eddie too and that he misses his mother and knows what that's all about.  That's how we started chatting and look at us now!  We're frickin' homeowners, for cryin' out loud!   Flashback: walking down broadway by 164th Street just coming from B's house.  I spot my father walking down the block too.  I yell, "Hi Daddy!"  "Hi muneca!" He says. Together, "what are you doing here?"  Then laughter.  He went to get some chicharron from some restaurant over there (I suspect there's a lady involved)  We chat, I point out that I now crave chicharron.  He hands me his bag and we walk a few blocks together.  Said he didn't really need it anyway.  Me and Ronnie had some yummy-ass chicharron that night.   I miss my dad.  I wish he were around to meet Steve.  They would have gotten along.  Luckily Steve's dad is a lot like the white version of my dad, so I have a reason to celebrate on Father's day after all.  I love Pop.  He's so funny.  Just like Steve.  YAWWWN.  I'm pretty tired.  I hate getting up early.  I hate having to bring the car into the shop.  Everyone is inconvenienced.  Damn I'm fat.  What should I wear today?  Maybe I'll put on my contacts... Ooh!  Bill Clinton is on the Today Show.  Cool.

        Started reading The DaVinci Code Friday night.  Finished it Sunday night.  Needless to say it was VERY GOOD.  Interesting  AND  exciting.  I haven't had that much fun with a book since Harry Potter came out!  (WHAT?!)  It felt good picking up a book for pleasure.  It's been awhile.  It was so hard to concentrate on any casual reading besides the occasional Entertainment Weekly when I was in school.  It felt so foreign to me then.  I have about 3 books that I started that I have yet to finish.  Gotta pick those up next.  Then all the books I've gotten as gifts that I havent read.  Then, onto the public library and see what they've got to offer me.  YAY, BOOKS!

        Trying to help someone who doesn't want to help themselves is futile.  I understand that.  That said, when a person comes to you for help, listens intently, then leaves you because they are seemingly 'ready' to 'do what they gotta do', and then a few hours later goes right back to the same bullshit is infuriating.  You ever feel like you're wasting your time?  Wasting your breath?  Y'know...I'm feeling a little bit of the "why do I bother?" right now... It sucks.  I... I'm just really f'in tired.

        Yes, people, its that time of the month where I hate being a girl and I am extremely homicidal.    Thing is, for a few days there, I was wondering if I was going to have to worry about this for the next 9 months or so.  2 negative pregnancy tests and 4 days late, I came to the conclusion that I was dying.  There could be no other reason for it.  I was already bequeathing my lawn ornaments to my neighbor and saying my goodbyes at work...  Okay, so I didn't REALLY think I was dying but since I want to get pregnant and we're ready for it, and then I was late, I got all excited.  So imagine having the nurse tell you it's not a baby but maybe AGE that was making me late.  Hormonal changes after the age of 30.  Oh you don't say... well DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!!    Another thing that sucks is that many signs of pregnancy are also signs of getting your period.  So you can't even use that to help you figure this shit out.  Basically, I'm a little disappointed, annoyed and crampy.  Why is it that some women can sneeze and they get knocked up but I have to actually WORK on having one?  Why can't I just be able to order one on the internet and... oh, wait.  I'm sure they have that already, but I want one with OUR genes, so that I can revel at the masterpiece I've made.  It shouldn't be this emotionally difficult, y'know?!  So another month goes by, no such luck.  Ummm...Anyone got any Midol?

        I rented this movie last night called  urlLink The Station Agent .  I had heard stuff about it and the main actor,  urlLink Peter Dinklage  in it but I didn't get to catch it in the theater.  It was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.  However, its one of those movies where I can't explain WHY I loved it so much.  Maybe I have this thing for lonely people in films.  I think that's why I loved Lost in Translation, Far From Heaven and the like...   Funny...I'm also very drawn to closed-up people.  I want to 'figure them out' and maybe 'crack their shell'.  Sometimes I'm successful, sometimes not.  It's funny.  I guess the pseudo-psychologist in me is fascinated by the multifaceted.  I love those 'jack of all trades' types - people who are interested in everything, people who only open up just a little to give you a taste of all they have to offer.  Its great, because you know it could take a lifetime to get to know them, and as the years go by, there's so much more to learn about.  I married one of these types.  I've also befriended many of those types.  Life is good.  But I digress.  The movie is about a little person who lives this life of relative solitude.  He loves trains.  When his friend dies, he moves to a small town to be alone.  Turns out that ain't gonna happen.  There's this goofy hotdog vendor and this wacked out artist who can't seem to just leave him in peace.  It's so cute how they eventually break this dude's shell and how everything just seems to fall in place like it was meant to be.  This guy reminds me of someone I know. (you know who you are.)  Oh and  urlLink Patricia Clarkson  is in it and I just love huh.  She's like butta.    Please see this movie.

        Steve is getting indoctrinated into the Benevolent Order of Elks next week and we had to go there last night to get acquainted with what the Lodge is all about... I keep joking that he's going to have to wear either a fez or a big moose hat (with horns!) like Fred Flintstone or at the very least do a secret hoot or handshake when he enters the doors.  It turns out they do a lot of stuff for charity and there's actually an eclectic mix of different nationalities and ages and there are even women members.  I will not be joining for all that are curious.  :-P  I was actually kinda bummed that I couldn't make more fun of it.  They have a nice big pool and when you're a member, you can use it, which is cool because its about a block away from the house... That said, knowing me, I'll never use it.  I've been in a state of blah this past week.  I can't quite seem to get back into the groove of reading and actually thinking about things more complex than the mundane.  I'm sure it will pass and I'll finally get to reading The DaVinci Code which has been on the coffee table for weeks!  On another note, you know how when the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz gets his degree in Thinkology from the Wizard and all of a sudden he's smart and says, "The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh joy, rapture!  I've got a brain!"?  Well I've been feeling like that lately.  Like I really know shit now.  I know, I'm strange, but it does give one a sense of confidence.  Yesterday I was, in my ever-so-humble opinion, spewing out all this insightful shit into people's personalities.  It was wild!  Still can't seem to pick up a book, though.

        I just got an email from Yahoo saying that I now have 100MB of space in my email account now.  It makes me wonder...are they trying to now compete with G-Mail's free account with all this memory?  It's not even a trial, they just GAVE it to me.  What's the catch?    Did everyone get this, or is it only a chosen/random few?

        I am in so much damn pain this morning!  With all the cleaning and prepping and whatnot, I'm exausted!  Having a party isn't easy, but the fun you have at one makes the pain bearable.  Kinda like childbirth, I guess...   Highlights of the weekend:   My wonderful hubby doing almost all the work at the party, from setting up all the chairs and tables, to cooking most of the food...from making slammin' pina coladas, to never forgetting to give me a smooch once in awhile... I've said it before and I'll say it again, my man is The Shit!  hehehe  My mother driving me nutty and all my friends that chuckled along the way.  My boss showing up and meeting my father-in-law!  One is the king of the one-liners and the other is the king of puns.  Both are very funny, put them together and all hell breaks loose!  Omar and Ed playing X-Box for HOURS in the hot-ass basement.  Those two are so nerdy, I love them so!  Many of my work friends showing up, acting like their goofy selves and getting me a gift certificate to Target a.k.a. "Heaven". (YAY, TARGET!!)  Everyone sinking into the ground when sitting in the back of the yard.  I guess its still pretty muddy over there.  Whoops!  Good-ass food!  Highlight: The chicken.  I have to say, I make a good marinade!  Rich writing me a poem as a gift.  Aww, shucks.  Sniffle.  Actually, all the gifts...really, people, you shouldn't have... but hey, if you insist!  (tee hee!)   SOMEONE  (ahem) giving me a graduation card in Spanish!  YES, I was able to read it, dammit!  LOL!  A little 6 year old asking me if I'm going to have a baby.  OH, YES SHE DID!  Sigh.  You gotta love the kids, though...otherwise you'd KILL them!    The cake!  Drool!  A Sunday party means people leave earlier.  No stragglers.  How cool is that??  My wonderful neighbors helping us clean up afterwards and taking down the tent and all that.  They f'in rock!  Thank you one and all for making my Graduation party and the whole Graduation experience as a whole one of the best of my life!  Mwah, mwah to everyone!

        9. George Michael is in town. He'll be on the Today show on Monday and the View on Tuesday.  He's also doing a signing at The Virgin Megastore in Times Square.  I can't play hooky and go there, though, because its right after the party.  Everyone will know I'm faking it.  Sniffle.  10.  Who's my friend?  Who will take their cell phone with them, call me while they're waiting on line and put me on the phone with him?!?

        1. My hands smell like garlic and lime marinade.  Although I stink, the chicken will be slammin' at the barbeque.  2. My boss thinks I'm in a bad mood today.  I'm not, but I  am  PMSing.  Should I tell him that?  Or is that too much information?  3. In the argument of a woman's subtlety of hint-giving regarding gifts, I was told, "Men are not malleable. If you wanna know where a man's heart lies, leave him to his own devices.  Do not give him instructions. Do not tell him what to do.  Don't encourage him to be good to you if he is not a good man.  You are absolutely right when you say he ought to know so don't remind him.  THAT is when you will find out what kind of man you got.  If he is a thoughtless dunce, it will show without you having to say a word.  If he is a great thoughtful guy, it will also show. The MINUTE you start trying to give instructions, no matter HOW subtle...you fucked up already.  Men are not subtle."  Hmm. Interesting.  I'm glad I ended up with a thoughtful guy.  That said, I still give him little hints once in awhile. I think it's just in our nature as women to do so.  4. I thought that when we got the house, I'd be all gung-ho about gardening.  Turns out, I like the flowers and such, I hate the dirt and the work required to keep it all pretty.  Like, did you know that you actually have to WATER these things?  Sheesh.  5. I have to plant my begonias today and I'm not looking forward to it.  6. I need a landscaper.  Who's payin'?  7. Looking forward to the party on Sunday.  Peeps, you better not front on me!  We've got lots of damn food that we paid good money for!  (heh)  8. I just got a Barnes & Noble gift certificate for my Graduation!  Yay, stuff!

        I've been running non-stop since Graduation last Friday and I never had the chance to officially thank people that helped me down this long, crazy path... so here goes nothing.  First and foremost I'd like to thank my mother for her unwaivering belief in me.  Yes, she drives me crazy, but that woman would not pay the rent for 2 months just to be able to send me to a progressive private school and get the best possible education.  She used to annoy me by not asking how school was going until I found out it was because she never doubted my ability.  This past semester she helped me more than ever, translating the Spanish-class-from-hell's lessons and helping me write sentences and such.  Secondly, my husband, Steve.  Not only is he adorable, but he is the one who convinced me to go back to school after quitting for 5 years.  He's great at pointing out the obvious to me and sticking by my side, from studying musical pieces to explaining Midnight Judges to me and my Political Science 101 classmates at 8am through a speakerphone.  I never would have gone back to school and did so well if it wasn't for him.  You kick ass, honey.  Betsey was always in and out of school too and although we didn't help each other with our respective classes, we were there to give emotional support when things were shitty and we had a test the next day or we had a paper due in 3 hours and we hadn't actually started it yet.  These are the times for people who understand you and your neuroses and she was with me all the way.  Thanks, B.  An honerable mention goes out to Salome for editing my Spanish  composiciones  and even commending me on my improvement over the past couple of years.  Through all the crap, we remain 'there' for each other.   Gracias por todo.     Thank you Marilyn for sitting with me at Graduation.  Us finding each other was like a godsend and having someone to talk to was great!  And lastly, I'd like to thank Bill, Cat, Hope, Akosia, Dwarym, Yvette, Tamara, Melissa, Paul, Ana, Anthony, and Patricia (and some others I'm sure I've forgotten) for hanging out with me in the classes through the years, passing notes with me, and for being generally fun people who made the classes that much more interesting.

        My best friend thinks I use the word "friend" too easily.  Too quickly.  I take that to heart when I meet someone new, but sometimes, I let myself go and trust completely and love wholeheartedly anyway.  And sometimes it is truly worth it.  What's great is when I meet someone who thinks the same way!   urlLink Rich Villar  is a good friend of mine.  Sure, I haven't known him long, but that doesn't matter.  As  urlLink Fish  stated last night, "This guy right here has enough heart to fill this room" and its completely true.  He will out-love the best of them and his devotion and conviction is unwaivering.  He is truly a man to love.  To admire.  Someone that everyone should try and emulate but will never quite get just as right as he has it. (except Steve, of course ;-))  I had never seen him on stage before and last night at  urlLink Acentos  he didn't disappoint.  Everyone in the room was hootin' and hollerin' for him, and deservedly so.  The guy can write a poem sitting at a traffic light!  And it will actually be good!!  He's so multifaceted it would take a lifetime to truly get to know him in his entirety...and that's alright by me.  But all poetry aside, I love the guy because as much as he's got going on in his head, he will always be there for someone HE calls a friend...even if some don't deserve it.  As another friend always says in regards to her devotion to me, "I'm never too far from petty."  Meaning, I'm always on YOUR side.    Rich, I'm never too far from petty for you.   Congratulations on a wonderful evening!  You were great!  :-)

        Me: I'll take a coke. Terence Stamp lookalike as Bartender: We have no soda here, Miss. Me: You dont have SODA?? Bartender: No, Miss. Me: Well alright then, I'll have a vodka and cranberry. (ah, what the hell, my choices were limited, so I might as well go for the gold...) Bartender: Yes Miss. Me (to Steve): Doesn't the bartender look like Terence Stamp? Steve: Who? Me: Zod. Steve: Oh yeeeaaaah...  I wanted to tell Mr. Bartender to go put on some make-up and head to the Australian Outback to get me something fizzy but I didn't.(obscure Pricilla Queen of the Desert reference)  So the place was pretty frou-frou last night and totally not me, but the company was awesome and I didn't pay for the meal which also rocked!  (Thanks, GG!!)   [ Aside: How long do you think I can milk this graduation thing? I mean, it was a great achievement for me...Think I could stretch it out and get free stuff and gifts after my party next week too?!   ;-)]    Finally met my friend's wife last night and her sister.  I've heard so much about them I felt like I already knew them and they didn't disappoint.  Also met a college friend and a co-worker of his wife's who were just really great people!  A few of them work for Disney and so we all talked about their animation and all that.  It was waaaay fun!! It was also somewhat surreal, on a personal level, because I haven't seen my friend in f'in FOREVER.  Soooo much has changed since we last saw each other and our lives are so different now!  That said, it was sooo wonderful to see him again after all this time.  Sniffle.   Star Sighting Alert!  Nicole Kidman walked into the restaurant and actually smiled at us as she passed!!  Okay, I think it was due the fact that we were gawking.  She was absolutely STUNNING and very tall, actually...  I mean, she was totally done up like she just came from a movie premiere or something.  It was cool.  My friend's wife also SWORE up and down that she saw Russell Crowe later on, but none of us could vouch for it...maybe it was the wine goggles. (heh heh.)  Then her sister thought she saw Tom Cruise after Nicole left, but it turned out it was a waiter that looked like him.  Actually, our waitress looked like a mixture of Tori Amos and Cate Blanchett.  So what gives?  Maybe it was just a Nicole look-alike since the restaurant was filled with them!    Naaah, it was definitely her.  But I digress...um... where was I?  Oh yes, frickin' tired, that's where.  So yeah basically, I'm going out again tonight.  It's so weird, this me going out business.  I don't know if I like it very much.  HA!

        ...Your lawfully wedded husband?  In sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer...aw, hell, for  at least  the next year or so?  Y'know, like, until you find someone else that's more interesting?  I mean, these two pissed me off.  I debated not talking about it but it needed to be said.  Sure, they're a lot alike.  Both from New York, both from the ghetto, both ambitious, both Puerto Rican, etc., etc... But really, people!!  The ink wasn't even dry on the divorce papers, from the woman he married TWICE I might add, before saying, "Yes, Jenny, anything you say, Jenny..."    She's an ass for always needing to be in a relationship and never sticking it out.  He's an ass for philandering and giving Dayonara false hope in the rekindling of their love by remarrying her after she forgave him once!  What are his daughters going to think later on in life?   'Fuck the fact that you wrote me a song and cry onstage when you sing it, Papi...you're a pig!'   Anyway, there is speculation around my office that she's knocked up and that it was a shotgun wedding.  I guess we'll soon see...  By the way, notice how I haven't talked about Reagan?  Well basically, I feel bad that he and his family had to suffer so much near the end, and I think Reaganomics was good  in theory  just like communism is good  in theory , it just doesn't end up that way...That said, I can't really say much else about him.  Rest in peace, Gipper, I guess...

        After a long-ass Friday, all I wanted to do was sleep but we had made plans to have a barbeque for some friends who can't make it to the party next week.  Had to clean the house up, cook some food, prepare some other stuff, do some last minute food shopping and somewhat babyproof the house.    After all was said and done, we had lots of fun with them.  AND I finally got some people to play my "Scene It" game - all movie trivia which was a helluvalot harder than I thought it would be, which is kinda cool!  Anyway, yesterday I was supposed to go to dinner with a friend from out of town but we resceduled it to tonight because a) we were beat and b) it was icky out.  Ended up seeing  The Day After Tomorrow  and vegging out at home watching  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , interrupted by  The Sopranos  and  The Dead Zone  in the middle of it and then back to the movie...  Didn't get to sleep until about 1:00am.  Again.  I dunno what's wrong with me lately.  I can't seem to get to sleep at a decent hour.  I have so much on my plate right now, it's annoying and yet I'm enjoying every minute of it.  Tonight, dinner with My Los Angeles peeps and their friends.  Tomorrow night, Rich's feature at Acentos.  Yes, I'll be there.  Wednesday afternoon/evening, finally planting those begonias I bought for the front yard.  Thursday, food shopping for the party.  Friday, cleaning the house for the party.  Saturday, cooking for the party.  Sunday, party.  Monday, cleaning up after the party.  After that, who the fuck knows?  It's all about the party, people!

        This weekend has been long, and jam-packed!  First things first.  I am now officially a graduate of the City College of New York.  I hold a B.A. in Psychology (technically I think it's Liberal Arts with a Psych. Major) and graduation was actually pretty fun!    Unfortunately with the City Universities, there isn't any dorming and most people don't finish their degrees in the official 4 years it takes to do it, so I worried I wouldn't have anyone to sit with or talk to before-during-after the ceremony.  However, I was thrilled to see this one woman from my Spanish class from hell and this other guy.  Then we befriended some other solo guy and we all had a blast.  It turns out I knew about a dozen graduates.  That was cool.  Actually, we ran into this other guy from the spanish class who came up to us and was like, "YAAAY!  US STUPID PEOPLE MADE IT!!"  We had to correct him that a) we are not stupid and b) it was a really hard class - but we knew what he meant.  It was pretty funny.  He took a picture of us to remember the class from hell.  Actually, they both got C's in the class and were forced to take the final, which I wasn't, so I guess I didn't have it as bad as I thought.  But anyway, back to the graduation...  Bill Clinton was the Keynote Speaker (!!!) and honorary doctorates were given to Walter Mosely (who wrote "Devil in a Blue Dress" amongst others) Frank Sciame Jr. (an architect who helped redesign many of the buildings in Time Square) and Richard Schiff (an actor who is in The West Wing).    They all gave speeches and Clinton gave a great speech about us all being the same on the inside and that because of this we should try and work things out, not start wars.  Also mentioned that CCNY is like a United Nations, with students speaking over 130 languages.  Gee... and now I feel REALLY bad that I still don't know Spanish very well.  heh.  Anyway, I can now kinda see the appeal Clinton could have on an intern.  I mean, he knocked us all over!  After sitting in the sun for over 2 hours, with no breakfast because I was running late, we went to Sylvia's Soul Food Restaurant not too far away from school.  Mmm-MMM!!  Smothered Chicken with Baked Macaroni and Cheese and Collard Greens!!  (drool) It was the bomb diggety.  AND my mother actually paid for the lunch for all of us, which was way cool.   After lunch and taking them home, our tired asses went all the way to Long Island to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  with the family.  It was cool to be there all together.  Steve's sister, her hubby, their 3 kids and my mother in law.  Almost all of us have read the books so it was fun to be all together to watch it.  Having to go to Long Island to do so kinda sucked ass, but whatchoogonnado?  I was VERY disappointed with the movie.  Visually it was different and there were obvious changes, like using more exteriors of Hogwarts, but overall it wasn't true enough to the book.  They cut out SO much.  I guess, if you've never read the book, you'd love the movie, because overall, it was a very good movie!  But basically, I was hoping for a truer adaptation and this wasn't it.  That said, I'll still be getting the DVD when it comes out.    And speaking of DVDs... AHEM!  YOU!  With our DVD of Harry Potter 2...you ever gonna watch it and give it back??  YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARRRREEEE...  More in another post about the rest of the weekend.  That was only Friday!

        Update:  I now am the proud owner of 3 tickets to my graduation tomorrow.  It wasn't easy though.  I was about to have a nervous breakdown.  The shit wasn't pretty.  Basically, I lost my tickets and unless I got there ASAP and waited on a line with the probability that I would not get 3 tickets, but only 2.  I didn't know what to do!  My best friend took a day off of work to go to this thing!!  I was literally having a breakdown.  And it was my own fuckin' fault.  I mean, if I had been paying more attention, I would have gotten this shit over and done with already.  I was  desperate .  I was on the phone for about an hour trying to get someone to help me.  I've come to the realization that my school is not really equipped with many helpful people.  In fact, I was on hold with one person for over 15 minutes because I thought she was going to get the tickets and hold them for me but in actuality, she put me on hold and FORGOT about me.  And then when she came back to the line saying, "Who are you holding for?" and I said, "YOU!" She tried to play dumb.  NO, I take that back...she WAS dumb.  Then I basically hung up on her and called this other area where a nice boy named Gilbert helped me.    Gilbert had become my new best friend.  I openly sobbed on the phone to him.  I told him of my plight and how no one was helping me and that he just HAD to help me.  It was his duty.  He felt my pain and told me to hold on.  I told him not to forget about me like the other mean girl.  He laughed at that.  He came back on the line about 3 minutes later saying that he could hold 3 tickets for me because he knows the guy that's running the show.  I gave him my phone number to call me back when he had them.  Then he didn't call me back within the hour and that's when I realized I didn't have my phone with me.  It was like I just lost my brain this past week.  Sincerely!  So I called him back and he told me that when he went back to get the tickets, the guy he knew wasn't there and that his assistant didnt want to give 3 tickets to him, only 2, but that the other guy would be back soon and he'd call me.    I told my boss I had an emergency situation at school where I may not be able to walk at graduation, sped home, picked up my phone, then sped over to the school.  On the way there, Gilbert called me to tell me he had them in his hand and that he'd wait for me to get there (technically he was supposed to leave at 1pm and I would get there later than that.)  It took me about 35 minutes to get there (its usually an hour drive) and I ran in to get my tickets.  He was very nice.  I bowed down and worshipped his glory.  All hail lord Gilbert!  I tried to give him some money but he wouldn't take it until I shoved it at him and forced him to.  Sped back to work, scarfed down some grub and here I am.  So yeah, I'm okay now.  I could use a stiff drink, though.

        Yesterday was pretty hectic and I'm extremely annoyed with myself right about now because I did do something really dumb...or actually I didn't do something that I should have.  There were designated days to pick up the cap and gown and on Tuesday I went up to school to pick them up along with the tickets for graduation.  I got my days confused and was pretty frustrated about it until they told me I could either come back tomorrow (yesterday) or the day of graduation to pick up the cap and gown.  So because I got caught in over an hour of traffic getting there on Tuesday, and because the hubby said he wanted to go food shopping on Wednesday after work, I didnt go back to the school yesterday.  (I could have, though, because we didnt actually leave for Costco until 7:30).  Well to make a long story short, I can surely pick up my cap and gown the day of the graduation, however I cannot pick up my TICKETS to it.  Every graduate gets 3 tickets and then whatever's left over from the graduates who aren't actually going to the graduation gets put into a big pot.  TODAY is the day where they take all the extra tickets and give them out to people who need more than 3.  So basically, now my tickets have gone into the pool and I'm worried I won't get ANY.  Oh, and I cant even go up there tonight to get them because tonight's the Prom at Steve's school and he needs the car, so I have to rush home.   AAAAHHHHH!!!!  [Dyanna frantically calls friends who may be able to pick them up for her...]   To be continued...

        So today the President of the company came up to me and said, "That was you on the shoulder of the exit this morning WASNT IT?!" And I said, "um... no... what?"  And he reminds me of how I skirted around all the cars waiting in line at the exit and how I kinda sorta cut a few people off in the process... and how one of them happened to be him.  So I basically told him the truth. "Look, Bob, I really have no patience to wait on line when I'm trying to get to work on time." And he laughed at me.  But really, who wants to wait in line when the exit is wide enough to fit me and someone else there?  So I have a little impatience while driving.  So what if I mutter (or yell) a curse out the window when someone doesn't do what I want to or doesn't allow me to do what I want (usually means speeding) on the road... I mean, really people!!  I don't rudely cut off people.  I mean, I do it quite nicely, but when you've got your turn signal on, you better be turning, is all I'm sayin.

        So Cape Cod was fun and relaxing as it should have been but I have to admit to being a little homesick.  I missed my little house and the comforts of home.  Sure we dont have a jacuzzi tub, but we have my porch glider and stuff like that.  I dunno, I just missed it.    On the trip we went to Provincetown, the gayest area I've ever been to in my life.  It makes Greenwich Village seem like it's homophobic!  We went there once before but we didn't really see much of it since we only went for a whale watch.  Needless to say, it was faaaabulous!  (Ronnie-kins, I got you something!! hehehe)  Except for the restaurant we had lunch in, Cafe Blase, which was very blase about its service.  Bla-ecch is more like it.  I actually had to signal someone over after sitting for 20 MINUTES waiting for someone to wait on us.  I mean, that's just wrong.  Totally.  We were in the restaurant for over an hour and a half and all we had were 2 drinks and appetizers.  What the fuck? was all I could say.  The place we stayed in,  urlLink The Barnaby Inn , was taken over by new owners.  It was kinda surreal, actually, since we'd been there like, 3 times before that.  However, that said, the new owners, Laurie-Ann and Michael and their 4 girls were very hospitable and are making subtle little changes to make it more their own.  The previous owners got divorced and it seems that the place had been on the market for over a year.  The husband was doing everything on his own and I assume it was hard on him... poor guy, he's really great.  Anyway, so now he's rented the apartment above the garage and still helps out around the place while he builds a new home not too far away.  I guess the only thing that was 'annoying' was the fact that this new couple have children, albeit the youngest is around 12.  Also, they literally JUST moved in so they were up very late fixing up the place and such.  I love kids, and like I said, everyone was VERY nice, but when I want to get away, the last thing I want to worry about is the fact that someone may hear me getting busy!  (did I say that?!? oh yes I did!)    We DID have a good time overall and next time we go up there we told ourselves to go to Nantucket. [insert dirty limerick here]

        Well I never did remember what I was going to write on Friday and then I got so busy at work that I just never got to blogging about anything.&nbsp; I feel bad, because according to my site meter, I get about 25 visitors a day.&nbsp; Which means 25 people are looking forward to reading about my life.&nbsp; I feel so honored, really...    &nbsp;  So sorry, guys.&nbsp; But now here's a recap of the weekend.&nbsp; It's kinda like VH1's Best Week Ever.&nbsp; I give you the highlights of the weekend without all the boring stuff.    &nbsp;  Friday Steve grilled Steak and we ate that with french fries.&nbsp; It was yummy.&nbsp; Oh wait, that's kinda boring, isnt it...    &nbsp;  Okay so Saturday Steve went to play golf while I waited for the cable guy to come and hook up basic cable in the bedroom upstairs.&nbsp; I would have done it when we hooked up the other tvs, but we had this terribly old television upstairs so there was no point.&nbsp; On the July 4th weekend, Sears had a sale on everything and I got us a new tv for like $75.00.&nbsp; So now with the new tv comes more options and therefore we just HAD to get the cable up there.&nbsp; And besides, it was only a $9.95 installation fee.&nbsp; But wait, it gets better!&nbsp; The cable guy was supposed to come between 11am and 1pm.&nbsp; He was about 20 minutes late.&nbsp; Because he was late, I got the installation for free!&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; Hey, I'll take what I can get, man!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I got so excited about the cable upstairs that I weeded the front garden.&nbsp; Yes, I know you  think  it's unrelated, but&nbsp;watch this...&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the fact that I had to actually get out of my pjs on a Saturday morning and look decent for the cable guy compelled me to actually leave the living room (y'know, since I was dressed an' all.)&nbsp; So&nbsp;I went outside on the porch and&nbsp;was reminded of the weeds since the clover was taking over so much you couldnt see the begonias... It was about time&nbsp;I took care of it, so I did.&nbsp; Ah-HA!&nbsp; See how its all related?&nbsp; At least in  my  head it is.&nbsp; hmmph.    &nbsp;  Moving right along.&nbsp; Steve had gotten me tickets to see Alanis Morissette&nbsp;and Barenaked Ladies at the PNC Bank Arts Center for my graduation and Saturday night was the concert.&nbsp; He also got me her new album which I wasnt impressed with but I didn't have the heart to tell him until I played it for him and about half way through he says, "Can we shut this shit off?"&nbsp; HAHAHA!&nbsp; You gotta love this guy!&nbsp; So basically we were really hoping that BNL would go on first which they did.&nbsp; They were really awesome!&nbsp; Such fun, I tell ya.&nbsp; Always look like they're having a blast on stage.&nbsp; I'm also in love with   urlLink  Ed Robertson   .&nbsp; mmmm-mmm.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Aside: Steve and I have this thing: if we had the possibility of having sex with a famous person, we'd forgive each other.&nbsp; It's only right since the opportunities dont come around that often, right?&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; So John Cusack was at the top of my list but now I think I've replaced him with Chad and Ed.&nbsp; John is still in the top three.&nbsp; You'll have to ask him who's on his list... I know Halle Berry is probably #1, but I dont know about the rest.&nbsp; It's cool though.&nbsp; I think he's got good taste.&nbsp; ;-)     &nbsp;  But I digress.&nbsp; BNL rocked out and then Alanis came on.&nbsp; YAWWN.&nbsp; I mean, she sounded pretty good, but she was so boring.&nbsp; Just standing at the&nbsp;microphone singing her songs.&nbsp; Saying the obligatory, "Thank you New Jersey!" once in awhile...but overall?&nbsp; Eh.&nbsp; So after "You Oughta Know" and giggling at the 40-something, bald, probably drunk, fat guy&nbsp;pumping his hands in the air and screaming out the song, we left.&nbsp; (So what do you think his favorite line in the song is?&nbsp;  'It was a slap in the face/how quickly I was replaced/and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?' &nbsp; hehe)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Another aside: According to I Love the 90's on VH1 (yeah I watch a lot of VH1...AND?!), and a friend of mine confirmed it, that song was written after Dave Coulier broke her heart.&nbsp; The guy from Full House that can make the Bullwinkle voice.&nbsp; For some reason a passionate relationship with that guy is just kinda hard to picture...and its also kinda gross...       &nbsp;  So anyway, moving right along.&nbsp; Us Northern East Coast dwellers had a lot of rain on Sunday.&nbsp; And I have cable in the bedroom so guess who didn't get up that early yesterday?&nbsp; Thats right, children.&nbsp; Me.&nbsp; I was in my pjs all day and it felt pretty darn good.&nbsp; Get this.&nbsp; I showered and then put other pjs on.&nbsp; I was going for the long haul.&nbsp; Wrastled up some grub and plopped on the couch for some quality time with Steve and Showtime On Demand.&nbsp;    Since we haven't had Showtime all this time, I thought I'd catch up with   urlLink  The L Word   .&nbsp; Its all about gorgeous lesbians in LA and their gorgeous friends.&nbsp; So Steve was into it.&nbsp; (snicker!)&nbsp; We got sucked into it and watched like, 4 episodes in a row.&nbsp; Then we ate some more.&nbsp; Then we watched some more tv.&nbsp; Then we ate some more.&nbsp; Somewhere in there I did the laundry and made a few phone calls and even IMed a little.&nbsp; Then we went to bed where I proceeded to watch more television.&nbsp; Then I fell asleep and dreamt about gorgeous lesbians.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just ABOUT THEM&nbsp;on their own... Not with me, you&nbsp;perverts... Like I was still watching episodes and predicting how it would all come out...    &nbsp;  And lastly the piece de resistance!&nbsp; I found my friend Rose.&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; Her birthday was yesterday and I ALWAYS call her for her birthday.&nbsp; We've been friends since we were 9.&nbsp; But we kinda went our separate ways and keep finding each other along the way... its cool.&nbsp; She's one of those people that no matter how much time passes you can talk like it was just yesterday.&nbsp; I love huh.&nbsp;&nbsp; So anyway, I tried calling her cell and it was disconnected.&nbsp; So was her phone!&nbsp; So luckily her mother still&nbsp;has the same number since we were 9, and I called her.&nbsp; She told me Rosie moved to Miami and gave me the number.&nbsp; AWW.&nbsp; She was all like, "AWW, YOU ALWAYS CALL ME!!!"&nbsp; We talked for an hour.&nbsp; Love huh!!&nbsp; Y'know I dont mind losing people that didn't mean much, but when there's a connection there, you always gotta find a way to hook up and keep them in your life in some way or another.    &nbsp;  So there you have it folks, the weekend.&nbsp; It's funny how I feel like I really didn't do much at all, and yet I can blab about it this much.&nbsp; hee hee!

        Okay so the kids are not 13, 11 and 10.  They're 13, 12 and 11.  Whoops.  OOH, and they made a stink when I called them the wrong age!  haha  Bad Aunt that I am can't get it right.  I tell ya, having all three at once is a handful.  Kudos to Steve's sister for being able to deal with it all.  Of course they've actually grown up with her so she's had some time to get used to the idea.  We on the other hand are almost lost.  Okay, I ain't gonna lie.  Its just me.  Steve's fine.  His teacher skills come in very handy a lot of times...    Like, last night, when the little one says he's not hungry for dinner, eats half a burger but then starts pigging out on chips at 11:30 pm, I didn't think twice.  I was just happy he was eating.  But Steve noticed how late it was, and how the little one was getting away with murder and took the chips away.  See?  Bad Auntie!  (well, not to  them .  To them I'm cool.  hehe)  Of course, I drew the line when the 13 year old was putting his dirty sock in his mouth. Okay, so I threatened to choke him with it if he didnt stop.  Sue me.  Y'know what he says, "That was some fear factor stuff right there!" with a smile on his face.  The grosser the better, I guess.  Sigh.  Today I will try and spend some quality time with the girl.  Between the oldest one grossing everyone out to the little one always talking to get attention, she gets a little lost in the shuffle. Perhaps we will go shopping.  Or maybe catch a chick-flick at the movies.  :-)

        I'm so dang tired.    Last night some of the boys were over to watch the All Star Baseball game with Steve.  I was supposed to have other plans with a girlfriend but alas, that didn't work out, so I was home.  I basically sat in the hot basement (I thought basements were supposed to be cool in the summer!) and watched  I Love the 90's  90-93, with a little  Blow Out  (my new favorite reality show about hairstylists) and  Queer Eye .  Then after that was all over, I watched a movie called  The Company  with Neve Campbell and directed by Robert Altman?  I didn't even realize that when I picked it up.  I just remembered reading something about Neve Campbell going back to her roots of ballet or something.    Anyway, I'm not done with the movie yet, but so far it plays out like a documentary.  The camera follows the dancers of the Joffrey Ballet Company around and we watch them practice and then there's a scene of the actual performance and then it goes back to backstage stuff... I mean, I can't say its boring, but so far, ain't nuthin' happenin', and I'm an hour in... It's weird. I'm drawn to it.  Go figure.  So the boys left around midnight but I didn't actually get to sleep until about 1am, and then I had all these weird vivid dreams about dancing and hairstyling. (gee, I wonder why.)  I woke up literally seeing double and I can't quite get out of the funk yet.  On a more positive note (or, maybe I should wait til AFTER they leave to know how positive it actually is) We are getting our Nephews and Niece overnight. YAAAY! 13, 11 and 10.  The 13 year old is well, 13, and therefore he's obnoxious.  The 11 year old looks much older than she is, and thinks she can get away with stuff because we'll forget how old she really is.  The 10 year old is a little ANGEL!  Okay, he's like a miniature Steve - adorable and clever.  He called me personally to ask if they could come over.  How cute is that?!?!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  It will be a love fest.  Or it could be me gossiping with the girl while the boys play XBox with Steve.  This weather doesnt allow for much, unfortunately.

        Steve and I finish watching  The Butterfly Effect  on DVD and he throws on the Home Run Derby.  Miguel Tejada is at the plate and he's already got about 3 home runs and no outs.  Oay so this guy keeps hitting the balls outta the park and people are going WILD!  But then you've got all this commentary from Reggie Jackson that has like, absolutely nothing to do with what's going on at home plate.  So I'm watching this guy go on and on and saying shit like, 'Ay, conyo!' when he gets an out.  All the while, he's never giving up...  15 Home Runs later and Miguel Tejada has set a new record... and I have to say, I was like, PROUD.  It was funny!  I NEVER watch baseball and I'm actually watching this little Dominican guy (actually, I don't know... IS  he Dominican?) hit these balls like theres no tomorrow.  That was kinda cool.  Yeah, I'm totally corrupted.  I watch football, golf, and now, Home Run Derbys.  Shut up, Q.  Stop laughing at me.  I know you're secretly giggling.

        So Steve told me that he was talking to his friend about my mint-cutting-the-tongue comment the other day.  It seems they didn't understand how one can cut their tongue on a mint.  Well I'm not talking a certs or an altoid, people!  I'm talking about those red and white peppermints that you get in stores and stuff.  We have a whole stash over here.  Those things have some air bubbles in them sometimes and so if you're sucking hard enough, the hole can cut you.  The edges are sharp, man!  Hmm... Maybe it's just me.  Is it just me?  Talk to me people!  It's not just me, is it?!

        This saturday I decided to wake up at about 11am, make brunch and watch movies on the new cable channels I just got.    Comcast is really friggin' expensive compared to Time Warner cable, but when you've got one channel 'a la carte' at $5.95 a month for 3 months, and then the price jacks up to $20.95 - FOR ONE CHANNEL, PEOPLE! - you start to think, if I've been paying $20 extra for the past 3 months because I've been too lazy to call and cancel the channel (and face it, we kinda like the channel) I may as well make this work for me.  The Platinum package is $20 more.  So basically I could get ALL the channels for the same price as what I was paying for one.    So that's just what I did.  Now there's a gazillion channels to watch about 3 things.  heh.  So anyway, we watched  The Four Feathers  which wasnt good enough to see in the theaters or rent, but it was good enough to stay indoors on a hot saturday afternoon.   Saturday evening was a party for Steve's Uncle Eli all the way out there in Long Island.  It was a surprise party for his 60th birthday (aww). Steve's Aunt decided to get all these estranged family members over to celebrate and bond with the rest of us.  It was really great.  Irish/Scots and Puerto Ricans together.  It was a fun time.  I got ribbed for not knowing how to dance salsa, and as per usual at a Spic party, the cake didnt come out until 11:30 pm or so.  HAHAHA!  Eli was very surprised and very touched that everyone came out for him.  Aww.    It got me thinking - my mother is going to be 70 next year and it  would  be kinda nice to find some long lost relatives and have them come out to celebrate it.  Of course I have NO IDEA how to get in touch with all these people nor do I know whether or not they'd travel from DR or Alaska to celebrate.  We'll see.  I have a year to work on it...  Sunday I decided, 'dammit if I have this big ass yard, I may as well use it' so I took an old sheet, threw on some tanning lotion and layed my ass out there to get a little color.  No self-respecting Dominican should be as pale as I am.  I was having such a good time... reading my  Entertainment Weekly  and listening to Lenny Kravitz's  5  album when the CD started to skip!!  I was SOOO distraught!!  What am I to do NOW?!  I guess I have to maybe see if I can burn it (and maybe the skips wont come out).  I also can't find my Maxwell's  Urban Hang Suite  CD anywhere.  And my brother took back the Marc Anthony  Contra La Corriente  CD that I kinda stole from him about 2 years ago.  That's like, the ONLY Salsa album I had (even if it wasn't MINE) and I loved it.  Yeah, I know I shoulda burned it but I didn't.  So, yeah, I have like, NO good tanning music right now.  But I digress.  I was only out there for about 45 minutes by the time I felt like my skin was frying and I went inside.  Since I'm so pale I used an SPF 8.  I still feel white.  I think I may have to use baby oil, fry, get red and THEN get tan in order for this shit to work.  And, of course, its going to be rainy all week so no sun for Dy-Dy!  On another note, saw this new USA show called  urlLink The 4400  which was pretty good last night.  I'm sure they'll re-run it this week.  Check it out if you can.  Its a pretty cool concept and show.  Try it, you'll like it! :-)

        ...Or is it something in the water?  It seems like a dark cloud has come over the blog community.  I don't get it.  Almost every one of the bloggers I know has some serious emotional shit going on!    Is it weird to feel a little guilty that I'm not depressed?  Yeah, I thought so.  If its any consolation, I just watched Cold Mountain and cried.  Steve hates tragic endings.  I happen to think it makes a film that much more romantic.  Eh, go figure.  Anway, my heart breaks for all you guys going through a tough time.  If you need anything, just holler.  I hope y'all feel better soon.

        I'm truly wigging out right now.  ALL of my guys are in today and they all seem to need something from me.  I'm goin' NUTS!!  Calgon take me awaaaay...or someone give me a gun!!  Well, people are just generally pissing me off left and right.  From people who start asking for things using their boss's name (like  that's  going to make me do it any faster) to people misreading my blog and thinking I don't like it when people get cryptic, (HELLO, I didn't SAY that, you fucking fool!!) I'm about ready to shoot someone.  I was supposed to babysit tonight, but it looks like that's been shelved.  In a weird way, I was kinda looking forward to it because in the 6 years since my friend has had at least one child, I have only babysat for her twice.  TWICE!  How funny is that?!  Maybe I'll go over there anyway, just to hang out...   SIGH...Maybe its PMS, but people are getting on my goddammned nerves today.     urlLink Guy , good luck on the job thing and  urlLink Taylor , I hope you work out whatever's upsetting you.

        Ashlee Simpson gets on my goddammned nerves.  And yet I watched a whole episode of her show last night.  I've watched more than one episode.  Is it normal to watch something about someone you hate so you can hate them that much more?  Are all 19 year old girls this assholic?  These are the things I ponder at 9am in the morning.

        So here's the thing I don't get.  You decide to have a blog, right?  Which means you talk about stuff in your life and you expect others to read it.  Usually those people are people that already know you.  Since they already know you, and because it IS a journal after all, shouldn't it then be GIVEN that your blog be honest at all times?  I mean, what the fuck, right?   Now, let me clarify: One can CHOOSE to be cryptic about something that happened, not name names, or even as  urlLink Oscar  did recently, make mention of stuff that you are writing in another journal and not talk about it on this one.  That is FINE with me!  Don't give us your business.  It's your prerogative.  Talk about trivial shit, what do I care?  As long as you're talking/writing, it's great!  BUT don't start writing shit that  SOME  people know is complete and utter BULLSHIT and play it off like it's truth.  Don't play this 'woe is me, give me some love shit' when you know you fucking had it and couldn't HANDLE it.  Don't try and evoke some sympathy from others when it's all your own doing.    Now I'M being cryptic.  Hey, that's MY prerogative.  But at least I'm being honest.

        ...for a brief moment at least...  I just found out that in Canada they spell Dork "Dorque".    For some reason, when its spelled that way, its THAT much funnier.  LOL!

        I only found out Thursday afternoon that we had Monday off, so that was a pleasant surprise to say the least.  We didn't have much planned, really, but getting an extra day after finding out you're going to be working for the CEO and the owner of the company starting next week was like a breath of fresh air.  Don't get me wrong, I actually really like these fellows, but having them dropped on my lap without discussion was a tad bit annoying.  We're going to work out the kinks on Tuesday...I'll keep y'all posted...  Yesterday, my mother and brother came over for an impromptu barbecue... overall it was uneventful (which is VERY GOOD with my family).  The neighbors came over soon after and we hung out with them in the late afternoon through the evening.  Saw the fireworks in our town which was way cool on many levels.  We were hanging out in the parking lot of a school nearby the park that was doing the show, which meant we were close to the action but not too close to feel like we are going to get hit by something or whatever.  Also, it was just a bunch of towns folks hanging out, drinking coffee with Bailey's and shooting the shit in between ooh's and ahh's... Afterwards we went back to the neighbors house to play this dice game called Pig with them and their two youngest daughters.  It was such a hoot, I tell ya.    Today I went to the mall with the neighbors and their girls to get a new bathing suit and some other shit that I really don't need.  I succeeded in doing just that, ah'thankyou!  Did absolutely nothing else this HOT ASS afternoon except watch a marathon of  urlLink Celebrity Poker Showdown  on Bravo.  Steve and I were glued to the tv!  But anyway, that's about it for the weekend, I guess.  I do have to end this post saying this...and, yeah, I know I have said it a billion times but why not just once more for good measure... I LOVE MY HOUSE, I LOVE MY TOWN, I LOVE MY BLOCK AND I F'IN LOVELOVELOVE MY NEIGHBORS!!  Life ain't really so bad, y'know?    By the way, I still want some more comments for my previous post.  Come on people, categorize yourselves!  It'll be fun!

        Got into this funny-ass IM conversation this morning about the differences between stereotypes... specifically what makes someone a nerd, geek or dork.  It seems that a nerd is on the top tier.  Nerds understand more, create more and are generally just smarter.  Geeks are a step below them.  Geeks love gadgets and gaming and such, but don't have quite the capacity to actually CREATE much of the games and stuff that they play with.  Dorks are smart, but lack a certain amount of tact or hmm... je ne c'est pas.    Perhaps I'm too close to it to truly understand what constitutes a dork.  Basically because I  AM  a dork.  Many of my friends call me that on a regular basis.  I think it has something to do with my goofy sense of humor, my weirdness about certain things in general and well, I don't really know what else.  Hopefully someone can explain it in the comments section below.  (hehehe)  It's okay.  I'm okay with it.  I'm relatively good natured about it.  I know that being a dork isn't necessarily a BAD thing...and neither is being a nerd or geek.  While chatting further this morning, my friend (a nerd) and I realized that, like in Dungeons and Dragons, people can be half something and half the other.  Sorta like a dark elf mixed with a human... or um... something.  Also, there are nerds that possess a jocky side (a 'nock', if you will) and some that have a very goofy side (let's just call them 'Rich Villar', shall we?)   Oh, and there are many nerds and geeks who don't embrace their nerdiness, but would be much better off if they did.  Or at least would feel so much better about life in general.  I mean, how great would it be to know and understand that you are more intelligent than most?!  I'm sure I'd enjoy that immensely, however, I will never know that feeling because I am just a lowly dork.  My husband is a strange one.  He is almost uncatergorizable.  He is very clever, funny, somewhat popular, not too sloppy, and is pretty darn smart. He also LOVES sports, listens to classic rock, plays golf for cryin' out loud, but also has a healthy obsession with all things X-Box, loves comic books and D&D.  So, what the heck is he, you ask?  Well according to a good source, because he loves AC/DC and Led Zepplin, that makes him a metal-head.  Metal heads have a very nerdy side to them, don'chaknow.  Sometimes, they'll scare you with the shit they come out with, especially with role playing and perceptiveness.  So go figure.  But back to me now... I used to read some of my brother's comic books when I was younger, I used to ride a plastic skateboard that I bought in Toys R Us in the house back and forth and back and forth... I went to Bronx Science, I got pretty good grades until Junior Year when all hell broke loose.  I left my mother's house to live with my dad when I was 15.  I lost my virginity to my serious boyfriend at 16 (do as I say, not as I do, kids!) and I used to f'in live for Duran Duran, Wham/George Michael (still do), Slaughter, Nelson and yes, I even liked the New Kids for a while there.    Nowadays - confession - When I clean the house, I listen to Wham's  Music From the Edge of Heaven  full blast and sing along to songs like Wham RAP and Young Guns (Go for it!).  Actually, I sing to a lot...almost EVERY song on the radio.  I'm obsessed with the entertainment business and star gossip, I married a metal head, and I obsess about my best friend's relationship because I need more drama in my life (actually I'm a control freak and I love her but don't tell HER that) ...have I forgotten anything?  I dont think so.  Basically I obsess A LOT.  So tell me... what do you think I am?  And while you're at it categorize yourself and give examples why.  I'm curious to know what everyone thinks.  You can also be something other than dork, geek or nerd.  You could be a freak or a slut, etc... I'll tell you later whether I agree or not.  Thank you and good night.  :-)

        Look out!  Here comes a Spider-Maaaaaaaaannnn!!!  Hee hee hee!!  Saw Spider-Man 2 last night and it ROCKED!  I'm in love with Peter Parker.  Oh, he's so troubled!  (sniffle!)  I'm not going to say anything about the movie,  per se , because I dont want to ruin it for anyone, but do have to say that I was most fascinated by the whole psychological struggle of Peter Parker.  Poor Pete.  I mean, I think I'd have some serious issues too if had a super hero alter ego, wouldn't you?!  After we got home, I watched Barbershop 2 on DVD.  (heh. It was a night of sequels, I guess...)  It was only alright to me.  There were some definite plot holes and the story was basically the same as the first, Ice Cube could give up his principles and give in to 'the Man' or he can 'fight the power'.  YAWN.  I think the funniest part was when Latifa was going off on Cedric the Entertainer.  Oh, can we talk about Cedric for a second?  How and why does he get billed as Cedric THE ENTERTAINER??  Okay, so Latifa isn't a Queen either, and technically Ice Cube has a real name... okay I have no point here.  I realize this now... I guess we just think Cedric's stage name is more obnoxious than the others.  I mean, hell, if he doesn't entertain me, can I just call him C?  Hmmph.

        God I love hanging out with people who love to cook.  It's a real treat, I tell ya.  :-D      Last night we went over to my ex's and his fiancee's house for dinner.  They're so cute!  Anyhoo, he loves to cook and they made a spread so good I felt like I was in a restaurant.  A nice, romantic restaurant with candles and everything!  Aww.  I felt so special!      Anyhoo, we had a yummy salad with candied walnuts, raisins and blue cheese (and I don't normally like blue cheese but this worked for me), yummy pumpkin ravioli in black truffle oil and yummy braised oxtail...for dessert, a yummy peach cobbler.   mmmmm...      ----       On another note, on the Diaz Family front, we are STILL fighting and I'm convinced my brother just FINDS ways to make problems and starts fights.  (sigh)  Since homicide is not an option, I just have to sit and wait for the day when we close on the house and he's out of my life.

        This morning my brothers and I went to see our lawyer for my grandmother's house.  We went there to a) have a mediator and b) finalize what we're going to do...  I tell ya, having the lawyer there REALLY helped me personally from feeling stuck in the middle or singled out.  Also, the fact that the lawyer is a friend and as clever as a whip doesn't hurt either.  ;-)  Anyway, what we've established is this:  We will sell the house.  Offer it first to the people living there and if they are not interested move onto a broker who will help us with the sale.  Sure his commission is high, but all of this money is basically money we never had before, so if we have to pay it out, so be it.  Same goes for the Capital Gain taxes we'll be paying.  Who cares?  We never had this money in the first place, so if we have to shell it out to The Man, oh well.  Hopefully this process won't take very long and none of us are shelling money out of our own pockets to maintain the house in the interim.  When all is said and done, we'll be out of debt to the creditors, I wont have to deal with my asshole brother, and I will be able to grieve properly.  Speaking of my brother...in case anyone was curious, he's still being an asshole, just not so much to me.  Now he's moved onto my other brother and his lifestyle.  No, he's not gay, he's just a clothes horse and likes to spend a lot.  But really, what business of it is his?  Fucker.  I can't WAIT until this is all over, man.  Daaaamn.

        Just came from the movies.  Saw The Village with Ron Howard's kid and River Phoenix's brother.  (hee hee)      It was pretty good, actually! I mean, the most interesting thing about it - and I'm not going to give away the plot or anything - is the fact that it's less based on the supernatural than Shyamalan's previous movies... which kinda makes it that much cooler.      Go see it.      And that's all I'm going to say about that.

         There is so much going on right now I am starting to feel overwhelmed again.  I hate it when you just want something to be over that you're almost willing to give up your share of everything just to be left alone.  However, in reality, how dumb would that be?
