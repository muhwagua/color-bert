      Today was a pretty good day...  I got a date....I am happy.  I found out that I know more advanced shit in Word 97, Excel 97, and Access 97 than I know basic skills...it should be the other way around...  I found out that my car is being a whore! I think I am going to need to replace the fuel pump...  I found out that Area 51 is indeed still active... www.desertsecrets.com

      Well this is the modest start of my blog...or restart...I have had several blogs...one which was hosted on my own server...then one on /. Now I have one here...maybe I will keep it up to date.  My purpose is simple...to let people into my life...seeing that I am pretty reclusive as it is...  So lets start this off with a little joke I heard...which made me laugh my ass off.  "So I am dating this homeless chick right now...now don't worry...really it is great, because after we have sex and she needs to get going...I can just drop her off anywhere."  Which brings me to this point. As probably many people out there in cyber land...or at least most of the geeks out there...I have no female. I did have one...and it was a relatively long relationship...but things obviously didn't work out. I'm not mad at her...I am dissapointed though because just after we broke up she finally developed a sex drive...which would have been nice while we were dating...but hey not everything can go well.  Now I am looking for a female to let into my life...or my life as such...I do have one that I am interested in...and we are going out to see Jim Breuer on Sat. evening. I am looking forward to it because I have known her for quite some time now...and we are pretty compatible. At least I think we are. So hopefully I will have a female to call my own.  Speaking on females...can anyone tell me why females always seem to gravitate towards males that are just not right for them...or are asses, dickheads, or all around pricks...I have several of these types in my life and it always confuses me. I am not a bad looking guy...I'm reasonably intelligent (at least by IQ standards) and I always treat women right...but when it comes down to it I always fall in that friend catagory. Guys you know what I am talking about here.  It just baffles me...I will obviously write more on this topic...because I think that it needs an analytical approach to figure it out...and I am just that ass to do it.  Till next time...  The world sux and there is nothing that can be done to fix it...so sit back...pop some pills...and watch the pretty colours.

We ate, we laughed, we drank...fun was had by all  I am still wondering what I will do for a server...I need some RAM for my little server box...I have a gig floating around in Indiana somewhere...I need to get at least 512 of that back to pop into the little server...and then I will be golden...right now it has 160mb in ram and I just don't think it will cut it...  Anyways...I am off...I will update later :-)

      hey its been a few days...  nothing really to report that is why I don't update as often as I would like to.  I did go to the Dentist again today...that is becoming one of my favorite places...hehehe Just call me Mr. Swisscheese Teeth...I have more fillings in there than I thought metal could go in the mouth...so I think I will chew on some Aluminum Foil later this evening for shits and giggles...  hopefully, blue glowy thing willing, I will have a job soon...then something interesting in my life might actually happen...until then I will just have to be happy downloading porn at insanely fast speeds, and drinking lots of fluids....  "My Idea of work is masterbating." "My Idea of hard work is masterbation that takes more than five minutes." "My Idea of being creative is masterbation without porn." "My Idea of co-ordination is masterbating while having your hand on the mouse and getting that all important put the dick away/close website/not look like you are doing anything look down to a millisecond affair." "I have now resorted back to plain old TV for masterbation...no longer do I need a blond with her ankles at her neck screeming "harder you stud"...that is my pitiful life."  Quotes by me.

      oh yeah and my car is a fucking whore...it is breaking i think....after over 600 dollars in repairs it is breaking...and it is the same problem as before...so the mechanics fucked it up royally...now they will have to fix it properly at a discount...because its the same problem...  I hate my life...and I can't wait to see what next month will bring...if it is what I think it is...then this blog will not be updated for a long long time

      Today my mom and I went to see  Tear of The Sun  or whatever that movie is...with Bruce Willis...now I love to watch Bruce...I think that he has had some fine acting...of course Sixth Sense and 12 Monkeys...and a few others...but this movie was just kinda a movie I expected more out of. It was kinda cool...but certainly not worth 8 bucks to see. If it had been me I would have drugged the people needing to be extracted and got the fuck out...  outside of that...it is a boring night...

      I have been in a pit of despair as of late. A lot of shit things have been happening and all of them were of my own doing. I don't think at this point I will make it the rest of the year...and frankly I could care less.  No I'm not gonna off myself or any stupid shit like that...instead I think that I will br off'd by our government...if they get their way I won't need to be on their rolls anymore...which is good cause I am kinda tired of my life anyway...why should I waste the oxygen

      today I should have gotten my car back...but nooooo! why...cause apparently they have trouble with cars that have electronics in them.  my question is...why are they having such a freakin hard time replacing the fuel pump...you find it...unplug and remove the old one...put the new one in and plug it in...then prime the system...bingo its done...or maybe it might be that they had the thing misdiagnosed from the get go and all it may be is a faulty fuel pressure regulator that costs around 40 bucks to replace and I can do that myself...if it has been misdiagnosed...then I will be demanding a rather large refund...if they couldn't fix it in the first place they should have just told me so...I would have been happy to take it to another shop.  sometimes I just want to cry...and today has been one of those days

      well i moved into the back room today...and after I got in here my grandmother got pissed off and wants me to move back into the middle room...  the hell I live in is a very complicated one. You see everything revolves around her and how she percieves things. I can answer a simple question with a yes or no and that would be enough to set her off in a snit. Now mind you I am a prick bastard...I know this...so when I am not in the mood to deal with any shit I make myself scarce and when I do have to speak it is simple and to the point...but it is rooted in the fact that I cannot escape doing something wrong even when I do nothing at all.  Lately she hasn't been feeling well. You see she had colon cancer something like 5 years ago...had a huge tumor removed...and it was very serious...any longer of a wait and she would have most likely died because of it. However the cancer could have been diagnosed a lot earlier if she would have gone to the doctor. She had been having gut pain for something like a year and a half...then she went. So hearing she had cancer in the first place really didn't shock me...really it didn't shock anyone...we were worried...but not shocked. Cancer is more or less the flu...it strikes a lot of people and kills a lot of people...but if properly treated with the right medicine it doesn't have to kill you...but to cancer "victims" (not to belitle anyone who has or who has had cancer...but they all think it is the worst thing you can get) it is some sort of horrific happening. My mom told me today that it is maybe the fear that they will linger and suffer with pain...well my answer back is they have wonderful pain meds...and if that doesn't work...a bottle of drano or a gun will (suicide is never the solution...but stop being such babies about dieing and face it with dignity).   Back to the story...so you see for the past five years she has been this "victim" or "survivor"...every conversation she has with someone who may not know (which there are few that don't by now) goes something like this..."well I had cancer...it was nearly N-Stage....I still have pain but I manage...and I watch my cancer markers...plus I have a restricted diet"...now she says it out of the need for someone to be shocked that she had something happen to her...she has to be a victim of something or other and has to have people in a tizzy over her whatever it may be... Most people simply go "sorry...glad your better" (while biting their tongue)...but some indulge her and because some people still indulge her it feeds this vicous cycle of telling more people. A friend of the family had cancer...I didn't know it...because she didn't tell anyone.   Because she craves such attention all the time there is only so much you can handle...even mother teresa would tell her to blow it out her ass. So I don't indulge it...that makes her mad. Now she went in for her monthly blood test and her markers were up...and yes they are at the "you should be concerned" level...so the doctor ordered a PET Scan (Positron Emitions Topography Scan...or something like that...they inject you with a radioactive dye and give you a full body CAT scan...close enough description) well they had originally scheduled it at this one place but the earliest they could get her in would be towards the end of the month. Then she heard about another place that could do it and they would be able to take her earlier (last Friday)...well for almost a week and a half all I heard about was this bloody test and how the two different places have two different types of prep (I told her it may be one place has a better Technician who will read the scan and may need less prep or one machine is newer than the other...but not to worry)...well it turned out she went to a newer machine so the prep was less. Now for the past few years she has had pain in her stomach and that is what she was worried about...but then she develops a pain in her shoulder...all this weekend she has been laying down and complaining about being in pain...which ok I am a pussy about certain pains (when my body doesn't want to work right and gives me hell...I lay around too...but at least I don't make noises for attention as she does...how do I know its for attention because she doesn't make them when other aren't in the room...I have sat in the next room and listened for them)...well she got the results of her test today (tuesday) and they found some sort of mass in her shoulder...now they have to do a CAT scan on that area to pinpoint what it is...so as a result she has been a real pain for the past few hours...very "look at me the sickly old woman I need to have all attention payed to me" role...now I have run out of patience...the only thing I am going on is the fact that I live here rent free...and really don't have to pay bills and she helps me a lot (and I mean a lot)  My whole bitch is this...for those who know me they kinda know what it is...for those who don't...I have Cystic Fibrosis. It is a genetic disease and it can get quit nasty and will eventually kill me. Now I have no problems with this...I have resigned myself to the idea...I am so comfortable with the idea that I invite it and embrace it (I am a little dark at this point in my life)...while most of the people around me seem to have a problem with accepting it...especially my family (the want to try and make me think I am normal now after having kinda pounded into me for years that I wasn't). Now maybe it is me...but I know I am going to die...and have a pretty good clue of how it will happen baring any accident or mishap. Being fairly young I should be pissed that I will not live long...but I am not...so why are so many old people or those who are "victims" of disease afraid to die? By "victims" I mean people getting cancer or coming down with menengitis or a myriad of other ailments that kill human animals. Death is yet another stage of life. For old people especially...why are they afraid? They have had a run (most good...some bad) so they have lived their lives. Just accept the fact you will die and nothing can be done with it. I can see giving a heart to a younger person or replacing a kidney in a 20 yr old...but in some 60 plus person...that is rediculous. A man who is 73 in the middle of renal failure and congestive heart failure (which my grandpa is dealing with...a whole other story) is hoping someone will give him a kidney...fuck that...I would give one to my sister...or Billy down the street if we were a match...but not to my grandpa or any older person who has lived their life.   Now I don't go around anouncing "hi I'm Mike...I have CF...it will kill me" that is information that people really don't need to know...if they want to know and have found out and ask me...then yeah I will share...but my disease isn't me...I'm not my disease. I want science to advance and cure diseases...I want them to use Stem Cells and do some cloning...because I know it will help future generations.  But...  People when your time is up...don't struggle or fight...just go on and die...it will be better anyway.  Well my rant is over...not very cohesive...but maybe you get the idea...  oh yeah my car is in the shop...fucking fuel pump

      Well I went to that fucking job fair...it was worthless...why would I expect that I would be any different from the masses...a job fair for technical people and business persons really means Wal-Mart need associates and Notel needs some phone pimps...only two tech jobs there...  I mean really at this point I think I will get some rare form of cancer before I get a job...  oh and I got a hospital bill for almost a grand...and when it was supposed to be covered by insurance but they say I wasn't covered then...then when I tried to tell the billing person I spoke to that I had tertiary insurance (third level) and gave her the name of it she said it didnt exhist...and that if I wanted them to bill that insurance I would have to call the insurance company (which happens to be a state agency) and have them contact the hospital...well they ain't gonna do that...and the hospital won't call them to get the billing procedure on as how to bill them...so I say fuck it...they can't get blood from a stone  My grandmother is having her lung tumor removed later this morning...now I feel bad for her...but here is what she has done so far. Later this morning I have to have her there by 6:15 AM...ok I can do that...I would normally wait until they drug her and leave, come home, catch a couple of hours of sleep, and then when the hospital calls me and tells me she is out of surgery I would go and talk with the doc....no need for me to sit for five hours and wait....  So she planned to have a friend come up at 7:30 and I am going to breakfast with her...and then we will come back and sit and wait...when I elluded that I wanted to come home and get a little sleep that made her mad...and she then said well if you don't want to take me then my friend will take me...I never said I didn't want to take her...shit I could care less...but I don't want to wait with my thumb up my ass in an uncomfortable waiting room...  besides when she comes out of surgery I wouldn't be allowed to see her anyway...and will probably be restricted...cause I went to the docs the other day and found out I have a serious lung infection...serious enough that they would normally have pulled me into the hospital but seeing that I have become allergic to pennicilian based drugs dragging me in would be the last thing they would do...cause while I was in they would desensitize me to Pennicillian...or at least try to...and that could take a long time. So with this serious lung infection I have been put on the last oral antibiotics that my bugs respond to. After the bugs become resistant to them...then I get to head to the hospital every time I get sick for major IV anti-biotics (which happen to be pennicillian based)...the doc told me point blanc that he doesn't have many options left to treat me...and that once my bugs get resistant over the next few months it will come down to how fast they can get me non-alergic to pennicillian to treat me...in other words I might have but a few months of relative health left...  Now I could have let him go ahead and pull me in now and start the process...but I didn't because my grandmother needs me around...if I don't start seeing results in the next couple of weeks from the anti-biotics then I will be in the hospital...  I am glad of all of this...to die will be nice...peacefull and less stressfull than my life as such...  Yesterday was bad, today was worse, and tomorrow will be harder than today.

      today I got a new keyboard...and I like it. It is the microsoft multimedia keyboard...it is pretty jizm...now I just need to mod the LEDs to a blue colour and all will be well  why did I get a new keyboard you ask...well I wore the old one out...actually I wore two of them out...I really dont know how I managed to do that...but I did...the one (MS Natural Pro) was pretty good but the keystrokes were sticking and some keys failed to register when I would key them...and my logitech cordless keyboard just plain out stopped working (and yes I changed the batteries)...the next thing I have to get is a new mouse....I think I am going to get another microsoft mouse...the one I have my eye on is the Blue one...it looks pretty good...now I just have to find it at a reasonable price (I am using the intellimouse optical...) The current mouse I have hurts my hand after using it to long...I just need to try mice until I find something that will work  I also need to do some upgrading on my computer (actually get some parts...)  but all of this is superceded by the need for a job...and sanity

      well I got my car back the other day and something was already wrong with it...which makes me mad. It seems that they might have engaged in a little bit of sabotage. When they dropped the fuel tank (which they did not have to do) they removed part of the exhaust system...well when they put it all back together they put a shield on improperly and that little shield was jammed behind a sensor. The way it was jammed would eventually cause the sensor to break off...now I am sure this little sensor would be expensive...especially seeing the way it would break off requiring the replacement of most of the exhaust system. They also let down one of the mufler retaining systems...and when they put it back they only screwed it in maybe two turns...so it was making a racket and would have eventually fallen off allowing the muffler to hit the ground.  Well needless to say I fixed it all. I am not all that pleased...and when I confronted them about it they only said "wow you have had nothing but problems with that car"...well it seems that more of my problems have been caused by them...I don't think I will be taking the car back there.  My grandmother has a tumor in her lung and it has to come out...and then they will know whether it is cancerous or not. They seem to have to remove the entire lobe. So over the next month my normal hell will go into overdrive...I just hope they give her good drugs to keep her out of pain...and I hope she does alright...  Well off to look for a job

      today I got out of the house for an hour...it was so nice.  My brain is gew, my guts are smart, my ass is hairy...my penis needs lovin  I want to be an angry comedian...my mom says that I have a very angry informed comedy about politics...that my sense of humor is very strange and without any moral or politically correct compass...and that the voices in my head really are only meant to be heard by me.  You see I get pictures in my head...now you say "everyone gets pictures in their heads"....well I think mine are a tad different. I dream in colour. I daydream all the time. I can have an entire seven year relationship with a banana in five seconds...the things that are funny to me are funny. I love humor that makes fun of people and disabilities. There is nothing funnier to me that a person with some twitchy disease like Timmy on Southpark belting out the National Anthem on a computer and me envisioning the batteries going dead and the machine kinda dying off...I find that hilarious...  I have a disability...no I'm not retarded...although I think retards are funny. I have no problems with people making fun of the fact that I am a gimp...  Sometimes I do feel bad about my sense of humor because I do realize that some people couldn't take it...but at the same time I feel that their is nothing sacred in this forsaken world...so make fun of everything and everyone...  If you can't laugh then you can't live...and lets face it...some shit is just funny

      I am just trying not to get to depressed right now  The reason is because I am pretty ill and I have to take care of someone else. The doc didn't want me to come in. I see his reasoning...there is nothing he can really do that I can't already do here at home. That doesn't comfort me in any way. I just want to be healthy...but I am not afforded that luxury  The one thing that really sux ass is that in addition to the coughing up blood thing...I am in pain. My left leg has kinda gone numb...which sux...my lower back on the left side hurts like a bitch...my headaches are more intense and frequent...and my chest feels like it has been hit repeatedly by a baseball bat which makes coughing the shit out of my lungs a tad difficult.  Unfortunately the doctor won't prescribe anything for pain...which also sux ass. However if I had something to take the edge off I would be even lazier than now...cause I would just want to sit and enjoy the good numbness that pain meds would bring.  Maybe soon they will give me something that will let me get back to something that remotely resembles life...but until then I will soldier it out like I always have...with a grin and a "I'm fine" to the family...knowing that in the end the pain will stop and all will be well.  I wish I were an optimist...because if I were it would mean that I live in a world of denial and stupidity...stupid people are happy...smart people are forced to live in reality and suffer for having to deal with the stupid people and their happiness

      the meeting went well...it was like a job interview...only for jail...long story that I will go into only when I have finished up with the whole procedure.  I had to give a hundred bucks to the court today...that sucked...but hey it is what happens when you run afoul of the law.  I rented and watched One Hour Photo...it was well...interesting and sucky all in one...I love Robin Williams...he could take a shit on film (which he did in this movie) and I would find it entertaining...all I can really say about this movie is that it was disturbing...and makes me glad I have a digital camera.  Later this morning I have a phone interview for a Job...I really need something to come along...cause I need a job...hopefully it will go well and I will get something through these people. That would be money yo.  Then I have a lunch date with a friend Amanda...then a Doctors appointment at which they will tell me whether or not I should feel good...I don't, but I have to wait for definite word as to whether or not I am supposed to feel like shit.  Well I am going to get a little shut eye...peace

      Today was a busy beaver day.  Lets see...first after I got up I made myself three scrambled eggs...now the only way to make scrambled eggs is with milk mixed in...so I did that and they were great.  After that I did a couple of breathing treatments and spanked the monkey.  Then I went out. I went and got some dog chews for Rufus as well as a dog tag with his name and my number on it...and I got him doggy breath fresheners...cause he has stank nasty breath. Maybe it is from him licking his twig and berry (he has only one dropped ball)...or maybe his ass...but it stinks, his breath I mean.  I also got my snake a mouse to eat and fed it to him...that is always kewl to see...my snake eating another living critter.  I got my hair cut...it is a little shorter than I asked for...but hey hair grows...and before long I will look like a shaggy dog again.  Also I had the oil in my car changed...that was needed badly seeing as it was way way overdue....  Not much else happened today...

      Well I was sprung on Monday...but I still feel crappy. I had a port put in...it looks like ass and feels like a rod in my chest...hurts to boot.  Looking around at people's IM info has just made me really depressed. A lot of the people that I met when they were freshman are graduating...and I have yet to achieve that goal. I suck. I have no job. I am sick. I am pretty reclusive. I am also a felon now...which really sucks balls. More on that when all is said and done. I don't know where to go or what to do. I am at a complete loss as to what I can achieve now. Really all I want to do is crawl in a hole and die...and that may happen soon enough given my poor state of health...but what have I achieved while on this planet.   Not a whole hell of a lot. I had hopes and dreams as most do. I wanted to go places and see things. I just wanted to be happy, and I would still love for that to happen, but it has yet to happen, and the more I go on the more I feel that it simply won't happen.   I feel completely disenfranchised by the whole deal. We have all be raised to be rock star, sport god, multi millionaires...yet no one really ever stopped to say. Hey get real buddy...you are like 99% of the rest of the world...you will be poor and live what will amount to being an unhappy un-fulfilled life. Yet people keep buying into the dream. People keep on thinking that :in America you can do anything, be a millionaire, and have freedoms only others dream about".  Well I am sorry to say that in America we are all running towards the same goal. Money and Power. Yet the simple fact is...there isn't enough money or power to go around. The money and power lies with but a few select people in our country...sure you maybe can achieve that through our system...but most likely you will fail and only end up afowl of the law if you try to achieve those things with any great vigor.   America is but a dream. It isn't real. What we are fed on TV is what the people in power want us to see. It has nothing to do with the common Joe (hell even they took that from us Joe Millionaire). Whenever there is a good idea it is almost always be corrupted by big business and stolen from the average man.   The one thing that distiguishes a citizen from a non-entity in this country is a Vote. As a felon I no longer have the "right" to vote. It was removed from me permanantly. Chances are I won't be able to get a Visa so that I can leave this country and start anew somewhere else. As a non-entity trapped in this nation I am essentially a slave to the state. I no longer have the right to vote in elections and help determin the way I think the country is run...but I still have to pay for it through taxes (which makes me even madder).   So fuck America (land of the free indeed) Fuck George Bush and his corrupt cabinet and little lackies. Fuck the Legal System which puts many under and essentially kills their voice. Fuck everything. It has all been a lie.

They say the pain will subside with time...well I am impatient and it hurts like a fucker...I hope it stops hurting soon...I am glad I have some access to pain meds...otherwise I would be gouging out my eyes to get relief...I will be getting a small prescription of Lortabs to help out in the next day or so...thank blue glowy orb...

      wow two days in a row...  last night after ranting about voting rights and gun rights as a felon I found some interesting information  I will be allowed to vote once I have finished probation/parole/whatever...only seven states take away the right permanantly....thank blue glowy orb I live in one of the others that you get the right back....so at least I will be able to vote again  As for the right to buy and own a weapon that issue is a little cloudy. The ATF has the authority to restore that right on a case by case basis...however the congress has tried to stop that and the Supreme Court has said that the congress can't do that...but there is no real clear way yet for me to own a weapon after this crap is all done with.  Also I can get a passport...as the INS and various agencies that administer that program review on a case by case basis as to whether or not to give out passports to felons...so I will more than likely be able to travel one day...  Basically I will recieve most of my rights back...except that I will have a mark on my record and it will hinder me from getting security clearances...but that can be dealt with as well.  So all in all last night I found out good news...but still I want to own a gun...I have owned guns for some time now...and have been an avid weapons person...as I know a lot about them and love to go to the shooting range and kill imaginary bad guys...  Ahh well that fight will be later in the life...when all is said and done.

      Well a milestone has been reached...as of about 20 minutes ago I turned 26. Why is this a milestone...well lemme tell ya. For the past 26 years I have only been able to "see" or "foresee" my life up to this point. I simply have not been able to see past this point. I can remember when I was much much younger being able to see things in my future from the most mundane of things as eating a hot dog at Disney World (which I did at the very place I saw in my dreams...which is very weird as have not ever being to Disney before) to more important things as the first person I would "fall in love" with.  I thought my life would end at 26...I would no longer exist. Honestly in some ways that has very much come true.  Here is what has been going on for the last six months.   In December I recieved an official mailing from the Eastern District court of PA for Federal court. For you see back in 2000 I was involved in what is called computer fraud...however it is prosecuted under the title mail fraud. I knew better yet I chose poorly. I have no one to blame but myself for the trouble I got into.  Flashback to that period in my life. I went down to a suburb in Pittsburgh to pick up a shipment of fraudulently obtained computer hardware. After myself and my girlfriend at the time and another person got there and loaded all this crap into my car out of nowhere came the FBI and Postal Police with guns drawn and what seemed to me at the time as a wish that I do something stupid and allow them to pump some rounds into my body. At that time I made a statement and turned over evidence of the crimes that had occured. I was told that something would happen but I did not know what would go down. They released me that evening and I went back to my dorm room and cried and worried. Fortunately for me at the time I had someone in my life that helped me get through the initial shock. I didn't tell my parents, I didn't tell anyone in my family. I kept quiet about it all and pretty much put it in the back of my mind with the knowledge that I probably wouldn't be punished to harshly and if all else failed I wouldn't be around for much longer seeing that I couldn't "see" past 25.  Forward to December of 2002 I recieve the letter...or better yet the endictment of the crimes involved. Well of course being the government they made the charges out to be much worse that what actually happened making the crime seem like I had killed someone and that I should go to jail without even so much as a trial.   I obtained a court appointed attorney which has been very good. He has literaly told me not to worry...not because he would get me off, but in the sense of "you didn't kill anyone, really this is a blue collar crime" sense. He has not made me any promises outside of that he would be the best advocate he can be...and he certainly has been.  He got the inital 11 counts down to 1 count through simply contesting the counts in the idictment. The remaining count is a charge of Mail Fraud which I have pled guilty to. It is a felony and I am now a felon.   While this whole ordeal is far from over...as I am still looking at possibly having to go to jail, paying up to 30 grand in fines and restitution to the company of up to 96 grand as well as up to 5 year probation. I have come to some resolution in my life.   With the way we are arguing...and rightfully so seeing that I have Cystic Fibrosis and I am quite expensive I most likely will not see jail time. There are some guidlines on the books about how if it is considerably cheaper to keep an offender out of the klink, then that step should be taken as opposed to burdening the system with another inmate. Looking at it from this point over the last 8 months I have racked up approximately 120 grand worth of health care costs I don't think they will put me in jail seeing that in that environment I will most likely become even more ill than I am.  I have mixed emotions about this all. I have never been one to use my illness as an excuse for anything. I don't want to be known for that. The only thing I have used it for has been for federal benefits such as insurance so that I can at least have health care. Barring that I have no gone around saying "I have CF treat me differently". Hell even when in college I only used it as an excuse if I went into the hospital...not if I just skipped a class. If I was honestly out because I was ill I always provided proof that was the case. Even then it didn't always get me the results I had wanted.  Being a person with CF has really sucked ass overall. I wanted to go into the military. I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to do a lot of things that CF simply will not allow for. Most of all I would love to gain about 40 pounds so that my 5'9" frame would look a little more natural...and instead of hovering around the 120 pound range I would be a more healthy 160 pound person.  As for the not seeing past 25 thing I am almost right...barring something happening in the next few months (and I am a pessimist so hell I may croak soon and with the way I feel it would be welcomed). I am already dead.  I am dead as a citizen of the US. I can no longer vote. I no longer have a voice in the government. I cannot run for an elected office. I am dead. For me the right to vote is what this country was founded on. The equal right to representation. Now we all know that there have been hickups in this idea (blacks, women, and initially those who didn't own land) it is still the foundation. I have voted in every national election since I turned 18 in 1995. I voted for Dole then Bush (which I regret by the way). While in MS I voted for Lott (he really isn't as bad as everyone makes him out to be). Hell I have put my contribution (albeit small) into the system, yet I will no longer be able to do that because of my conviction.  In the end I am left with a feeling of loss. I am left with a feeling of disalussionment. I am left with a feeling of complete and utter confussion.  I have confessed to my crime, I am willing to do the time if necesary. However I am not willing to give up my basic right to vote, or the rights afforded to me in the constitution after I have paid my debt to society. I am not violent, nor would I be, but this does bring up thoughts of unrest in my head. I have been stripped of all but the basic rights to exist and breath (which with CF have also been almost completely removed through disease).  What is my future? I don't think it will be much. To this point I haven't found my place. I haven't found lasting love. I haven't found happiness no matter what I have done (drugs, working out, trying to live right, trying to live wrong, god, anything). The only hope that I have at this point is that in my last days (which I feel are probably sooner rather than later) I will be comforted by a morphien drip or something along those lines, and by the knowledge that as I loose the ability to bring oxygen into my body that my brain will slow down and loose some of the potential that it once had. That when I do slow down I will be able to not worry about everything and all the wrong that is in the world (from what is wrong here in the US (and there is a lot of that) to the wrongs in the world).  The most comforting thought to me is this.  That in the end there will be silence.

      ok so I haven't updated in a few days...well there was a reason.  I was once again in the hospital...oh the lovely hospital...how can I explain my joy at visiting the place. The people are so lovely, the treatment is great...I just love it there...outside of being couped up it isn't so bad...  Next time I go I am going to make a concerted effort to get online service while there...I have DSL here at the house and I know that they have a dial-up backup for when it goes down...I just need to find out a number for it...and I also need to see what kind of restrictions are on it...cause I don't really want to have to pay a lot for that...if worse comes to worse I can get some sort of access for 10 bucks a month...at this rate it might be worth it...or I will get a wireless card for my computer (which actually makes more sense cause I have unlimited internet access on my SprintPCS phone and they have cards for that...I wonder if I can have a card and a phone on the same account without running up a huge ass bill). Another thing is my poor ole laptop is giving up the ghost yet again...the CD-Rom drive is just plain broke down...it doesn't want to even read clean scratchless disks...I guess it is about time...the thing is only 4 years old or something...a long life for a part like it. So I have to think about getting a new laptop...something that is certainly more powerfull than the one I have now...maybe close to my home system (which even now isn't anything to sneeze at)...I personally have my eye on a newer Sony Centrino Laptop...and with a Sprint card that would work great for a few years...but alas I need to make money first...which I am trying to do...  The only reason that I would want to go to a slightly higher model laptop is because it will last longer...it has better video subsystem on it that would allow me to play some SOF2 or something while in the hospital...in other words I could game a little...I could opt out and get a whole hog gaming laptop and spend 3 grand...but that is rediculious for something that will be outdated in a few months...the Sony I have my eye on is pretty fast...has a decent display and bits to run it (good enough for the basic gaming that I do) and plenty of hard drive space...plus a DVD/CD-R drive...so I can watch movies and burn CD's...plus the battery life is up to 8 hours...and it has a lot of other built in goodies...I would just have to find a good deal on one...I find that I would do more if the system I had to plod along with me could do more...it is just old and worn out :-(  But that is in the future...  Again I was in the hospital...only out a record 2 weeks...and back in...it only took 10 days to get something back in my lungs...ohhhh I love having little critters in my chest...they bring me such joy. I was in only 7 days...so that wasn't so bad...  All in all I like going there...mostly because almost all of the people I have dealt with there have been great. From all the nurses aids (John, Katy, and others...although those two are the most amusing)...the nurses have been great...Andy sticks out in my mind...nicest guy...think of very tall guy with very germanic angular features...someone that you might not want to meet in an alley under bad circumstances...but damn he is the nicest guy...really goes out of his way...  I also would like to think they like me as a patient...simply because I am autopilot really...hey bring in the meds (even if they need to be hung and run), leave some flushes...and bam just check in with me every once in a while and I am all good...and the food is pretty damn good overall...they have a few things that I wouldn't even feed to my dog...but for the most part it is good food...  Really I can't think of anything bad to say about the hospital outside of the 6 or 7 dollar a day charge for a TV and Phone...which the TV get only a few chanels...that needs to be fixed...but overall that is a great hospital and I am glad that I get to go there...one thing they could use would be some sort of diversion for the younger folks there...video games, VCR carts, something...but hey only in a perfect world (and in a perfect world they would have Wi-Fi and you could use a fat internet connection)...  Oh well...lots to do...lots to research and get ready for the innevitable return to Shadyside floor 6....it will happen...I know it...they know it...so at least we are all in the know :-)  Thanx to the people that read this...  I am still having problems posting my email for people to contact me on the site...so here it is again...as always any input would be great... m.p.honse@verizon.net  email me and we can start a pen pal relationship...or I could just verbally abuse you...or you me...anyway it will all be in good fun

      Tonight I watched a show again that I had seen a while back. It was on the Discovery chanel. It was on the differences between the sexes. When it got to one point in the show it made me feel really fucking jipped.  Ok so aparently those little things we call pherimones play some role in reproduction. Well we all know they do. Women and men are helped out by these chemicals as they signal compatitbility and whether or not you have a strong imune system.   Well I guess I am screwed in the sex game. My system is frail and weak and certainly not meant to go on. Pherimones may well be the reason that I have such poor luck with the ladies (as with some other things). Simply I signal to them that I am not good mating material. Who am I to argue with millions of years of evolution and science based fact.   As far back as I can remember I have never been good with the oposite sex...especially in trying to get it. Sure I have gotten lucky more than a few times...but that was usually through the excessive consumption of alcohol on both parties side. Women are just not attracted to me...or my smell. I don't smell funky except when I am on anti-biotics (which I currently am)..and I have always kept myself clean...so it must be my unoticed but important pherimone smell.   Because of my illness I send it out in chemicals that women pick up on...and while they may think I am nice, whitty, intelligent, maybe even cute...I am never the material for mating...  So where does this leave me...in the shitter...  I haven't had sex in quite some time...partly because of my lack of going out and being social...but I also think that my chemistry has something to do with it all. So who knows...  At this point I would love to get laid by a hottie...everyone wants too...but at the same time I really don't care if I get laid or not...I have a hand and a large collection of high quality porn...so I can keep the primal urges at bay. Which is another point...I don't have many primal urges...and that comes from my dad who has a very low libido...I mean he might as well be a monk...  Ahh well...thus is life.

      I went to see the Matrix Reloaded movie...ahhh that was a kick ass film...I have a feeling this year will be a panicopia of films. All sequels...but so far all of the sequels have kicked ass!  So lemme tell you about Reloaded. Reloaded and Revolutions were filmed at the same time for around 300 million...of that roughly half of the budget went into "wow" effects...in other words CG and Special Effects...and lemme tell you they certainly got their bang for the buck! It simply kicked much ass. Some people have complained that there is no story and that it is just a long action sequence...and well there is a story and it is bolstered by the action most definitely.   There is one scene in the movie where the "evils" of man is being explained and they flash Hitler, the A-Bomb and some other things...then they flash across the screen both of the President Bushs'...to call them evil is going a little far...but I will say neither man has lived up to "good" standards...so I can see where they are coming from (even though I did vote for this Bush in the last election).  The story is simple...after thinking about ten minutes about it I got it. You have to wait till the end of the movie before they really "bend your noodle" but it is well worth the wait. So here is the story in a short and simple fashion.  Mankind goes in cycles. History goes in cycles. Everything that was will be again and everything that is will be destroyed. Throughout history mankind has built up many great civilizations. The Greeks, Romans, Egyptions, Syrians, English, Spanish, French, Russians, Japanese, and even Germans. They all built empires that eventually imploded and left the regions decimated and in tatters. People may say "well the Americans haven't done that and we will not repeat the fate of those other great nations and civilizations." Well folks we will repeat it...over and over again. Sure once America per se is gone another great power in the world will grow and take over, but it too will fall in time. Humans are doomed to repeat history...its as simple as that.  However. There is one way that we can defeat history and move forward and continue on our journey through time. The only way to do that is to shed the old, get rid of the old way of doing things such as building wealth, building power, and rid ourselves of our fudal past. How you ask. First we need to stop looking at everything as a competition. We all compete on a daily basis. We compete for a better lane position at a red light, we compete for the hottest chick on the dancefloor, we compete for world resources. Sure competition drives technology and drives humans to do better things, but at the same time we take the competition to far in many cases. We compete out of fear and intolerance.   History has taught us that this competition only drives us to failure in the end because no one can have everything. Not everyone can have unlimited resources and expect the rest of the world or people of the world to go with this ideal willingly. We are in that same situation right now. America has become resource needy. We need massive amounts of everything to just survive as we see it. We need billions of barrels of oil to function anually. We need billions of metric tons of natural gas to heat our homes. We simply need to much to get by. Now if it were only us in the world that might not be so bad. But we are but a small portion of the worlds population yet we consume the most resources by far.   How can we stop it. How can we not repeat history. Well I really don't have all the answers, but I do know this. We need to be more tolerant of other peoples needs in the world. We are the richest nation on the Earth yet we have massive amounts of people without even basic health care coverage, yet don't seem to mind sending billions of dollars to Africa to "stop" AIDS. Is that a bad thing trying to stop AIDS in Africa...no it isn't, but the money would be better spent on developing cures and vaccines for the AIDS virus...then once we have those drugs we could easily erradicate AIDS everywhere. A worldwide innoculation campaign to stop it. We spend more money on learning about the male erection than we do on many diseases...in all our priorities are fucked up.  Another step would be to start giving services away. No I am not talking about making everything for free...that wouldn't work either because to many people would simply choose not to do anything and sooner or later that type of system would crash...but basic things like food, water, drugs, health care...make those things a non-issue...a happy well fed people are generally healthier, and less violent. If we fix things here first...and we make really significant changes here then we can export those changes and guess what...those people who have less then us all of a sudden don't have less then us. They have food, health care...they have the means in which to live.   We need to stomp out materialism. I know I know...I love my toys and gadgets and fancy things as much as everyone else. I love sitting in front of a computer with two Flat Panel Screens and having my desk cluttered with electronic gadgets...do I need them all. No. However they do make life more bearable. Does everyone need these things...yes. We all need some level of materialism. It helps us...makes us feel better about ourselves...are these things nesecary for life...nope...but they make life a little more fun.  We live in an unprecidented time folks. We have a lot of choices to make. We can choose to get along and bring everyone to a reasonable level of "consumerism" and "materialism" yet function as a planet. But that is a choice that has to made. It has to made by people, it has to made by the leaders.   We fight amongst ourselves like five years olds fighting over a swing. We can choose to make things better. We can choose to drive more efficient vehicles and demand that the government mandate that...we can choose that car companies make more efficient vehicles and move towards alternative fuels...we can choose that here because we have a system that is based on market demand. We can choose with our dollars.   We can choose with our votes politicians or people with better world views. People that see the problems and choose to say something about it and try to do something to correct them.   Face it folks if we don't choose to go down the path that hasn't been traveled before then we choose to repeat history. The old well worn path is easy to follow. It is the new untested path that we have never chosen to go down before that will lead to our salvation as a nation and a species. There are so many bigger problems out there. We could be hit by an asteroid tomorrow...we have no plans for that...hell we only scan 2 percent of the sky for rogue rocks headed our way. We will run out of oil soon. Our entire world that we know is oil based. Many synthetic products start their lives as oil. We can choose to move to alternative energy sources and spend billions on learning how to "do" fusion instead of building new nuclear weapons. All of these things we have the power to do. But because it is so much more difficult to do that than to keep the status quo we always choose the easier path.   And that my friends is the quandry we face. Do we choose to go the easy way. Or do we choose to go the harder way.   Red Pill or Blue Pill. The choice is yours.

      So today has not been a complete waste of a day...I was able to get a copy of T.a.T.u.'s 200kph in the wrong direction...I like the CD...it is pretty bad ass...and you know I just love pop tarts...especially when they are foreign...cause with foreign chicks they don't speak english real well (along with myself...not) so a relationship would be fun...  Scenario: Chick: something spoken in a foreign tongue and then some broken english Me: "shhh...don't ruin the moment" as I put my finger over her lips in a Jim Carrey'esk way (think Dumb and Dumber) Chick: "awww...we really click" Me: "yeah babe...now shhh"  heheheh I could see it happening...with any foreign hottie...like Shakira, DJ Rap (even though she speaks english), both the girls from TaTu...ahh that would be the life...  What I would do to those women...uuuhhh jizz...  I am finding places on my body that don't hurt as much when giving insulin...which is great...cause shots that you give yourself suck ass...but I will get used to it...also on the health front I go to the docs this Wednesday and he will tell me how I should feel...I don't feel bad...but I don't feel good. So we will see...I can tell now that my lung functions really haven't changed at all...they are still the same. When I go back to the hospital I am going to hunt down the physical fitness center and get in there and get my endurance up. When I was doing a lot of physical activity not all that long ago I felt better...and I know that helped my heart out a great deal giving it extra strength...now it feels weak...so I need to build it up. The only parts on me that work relatively well are my heart and my eyes...and with this diabetes crap I only hope that my eyesite doesn't go in the shitter...cause that has always been my strong point physically....like having excellent night vision and great vision overall (considering the rest of my family needs heavy prescriptive glasses)...  Other shit...well I have been doing some research for a friend on his Baseball card collection and it would seem he has a relative fortune in them...which is kewl because I know he will share some of the winnings from them with me for helping him out...  On a sad note that same friend is in a bad way...his grandmother is sick and isn't in great shape...now I don't pray often...but I did say a little prayer for him and her...having been sick and having had my own grandmother been sick (she had Colon Cancer five years back and just recently had a Tumor removed from her lung) I know how stressful it is...especially when you have a family that is going to end up fighting over the assets after the passing...families are supposed to stick together and get close in times like those...but for him it would seem that his family is already swooping in like vultures...as I know it will be here when my GM goes...(I have an uncle who can be an ass and will be when that time comes...when our Great Grandmother died he and his wife at the time swooped in and collected up some keepsakes that maybe shouldn't have gone to them at the time but that is over with)...  So all in all it has been eventfull few days...my mom and I went to Prospect PA to visit with old friends from way back in the day to have a picnic...it was very relaxing because I didn't have people breathing down my neck...and with me not being in the best of health it was needed...I really hate when people are harping over me when I feel like shit...ok I feel like shit just leave me alone please...I don't enough energy to deal with all that and heal...my energy supplies are very very limited...  Wednesday I am going to see The Matrix Reloaded if I don't have to head back to the hospital...and even if I do I will tell them I will come in on Thursday...hahahaha...I need to see that movie! I will be going with the husband of one of my grandmother voice students...I am looking forward to it because I will be hanging out with someone my age for once....and plus he is sooo low maintenance as far as friends go...I call him the "budda" because he has the patience of a Buddhist monk...nothing bothers him...I wish I had his brain chemistry...that would make my life easier...  Well enough for now...If I have to go in I will let everyone know...well everyone who reads this blog...which I feel is probably like three people! hahaha  I really want to know who reads this...so if you do read this please drop me a quick email...I am just curious...please! oh please! m.p.honse@verizon.net

      ok so I have been playing a lot of games lately...like really a lot of computer games...shit I have downloaded several demos...Will Rock and Breed...and I intend to download more.   I am a demo guy...I don't own many games...simply cause I haven't really run across that killer game yet...but I know I will sooner or later.  I have been hunting for a laptop...a dream laptop...cause that is all it is at this point...a dream..hehehehe...but I think I have found a worthy candidate for a moderate kinda do a little of all things...an Acer Travelmate 800CLi...Centrino 1.4, 512MB RAM, 40GB HD, Radeon 9000 64MB, and some other goodies...would suit me fine and is a lot less expensive than a Sony or most other notebooks...and it has a DVD/CD-R on it...so hey it would fill all the needs most certainly.  Not much else to report...my uncle and his wife and kid are here...so right now I have the stress level of a CEO...only without the perks...like free money, hookers, good attorneys...but I did clean my car from head to toe...with Orange Cleaner...yeah...that did the trick...now it is clean and smells good...didn't give it a coat of Armor All yet...don't think I will do it this go round...I also washed and waxed it...after all that cleaning I was tired...and that is what I am now...so off to bed...  Peace all

      people who have lyrics in their AIM profiles show no originality whatsoever...that is why I have put some lyrics in mine...closer by NIN...I put it in there for the ladies...hahahaha  Well today has pretty much been a crap day. Not much happened...I didn't get out to sell my last train bits...but I will do that tomorrow...hopefully.  Tonight I may go see my friend Jesse...he has come back to Indiana for the next few days and I haven't seen him in a while...be good to hang out with someone my age...actually he is younger...but that makes no difference yo.  Got a call from one of my friends named Teresa..haven't heard from her in months. She is the former roommate and friend of my friend Jonelle...she is pretty funny. She has a good look on life...she is pretty religious...which I don't talk to her bout that cause I am very anti-religion...not anti-higher power...but anti-religion. I have to give her a shout back to see what is up and make sure all is well with her...  Oh well I am off to surf for some porn then off to do some other shit...  Peace out Yo!

      I dunno where I am right now...I mean literally I am in my room...but figuratively in my life I have no clue  I would love to be a millionaire with hot babes wanting to get in my pants...cause I am pretty...but that hasn't happened just yet.   There are a few ideas on the chopping block on how to make that happen...but nothing firm yet...shit I'd settle for just some female and a couple of bucks.  Tomorrow I will sell the last of my Lionel Train bits hopefully and close out one phase of my life...mainly a fine in MS...then onto bigger and badder things...like what kind of fine will I have with all this legal crap facing me...will I be able to leave the state...will I come out of this one...who knows but I hope that it will all work out for the better.  I don't have a job right now...and really I haven't looked all that hard this past month. I have been sick and just not up to it all...but soon I will be well again and ready to face that challenge. So we will see...  On a side note my porn collection has now topped 10 gigs...almost time to get new system with bigger hard drives...the next system I build will be better than this one...but that may be a year or so off...or whenever I get a job...because right now I need a new laptop as I have said before...if I cram up my hard drives then I will get an encloser for a firewire or usb2 port and a big ole HD...like 180 or more gig HD....plenty of space for my growing porn and mp3 collection. In total I have 20 gigs in mp3's (mostly complete albums) and the aforementioned 10 gigs of porn...all hq and very tasty...  Well off to kill a few people on SOF2 and then some rest...  peace

      Well I am back from court and the good news it that I am not going to jail per-se  Here's the wrap. I got six months home detention, four years probation, and 96 odd thousand in restitution. So for six months I can't really leave the house but to go to the store, hospital, doctor, probation office, or job. Plus I get a k-rad ankle bracelet and base station...which will be in place next week. Four years of "don't fuck up time" in which I can't fuck up with anything more serious than a traffic ticket (even then they could technically nail me). During this time I am not allowed to drink or do drugs at all (which drinking pisses me off...but I don't drink that much now). For the first six months I am stuck here in the house...after that I can come and go as I please as long as I report to the office every so often (probably once a month) and let them know if I am going out of the Western District of PA. In addition during the home thing they can come visit whenever they please...plus I get the honor of pissing in a cup...most likely once a month for the next four years.  The 96 thousand in restitution will have to paid at a rate of 10% of my gross monthly income which right now would come out to about 53 dollars...and if I make more of course it will go up. Also if I want to get a new car, house, line of credit I have to report it and get approval for it (and they said as long as I am up to date with my restitution that wouldn't be a problem). I cannot own a gun either.  Technically I can't vote either...however they cannot prevent you from voting. All they would be able to do is challenge my vote and have it nullified. So a note to fellons out there...go ahead and vote with the knowledge that while technically you cannot the constitution provides that you can. The only thing they can do is challenge it and have it tossed...which in the end would make a great case to go in front of a court if they did challenge your vote. If nothing else the ACLU might take that one up. I plan to continue voting.  The head hancho of this whole mess finally plead guilty but is still trying to weasel out of responsibility and blame it on me, but the prosecutors and investigators aren't buying it and might have me and my ICQ log at his hearing. That kinda pisses me off. Trying to blame me for the entire deal. That is just obsurd, and apparently the prosecutors think that way as well. They seem to be out for blood and seeing the way they work...they'll get it.  All in all I didn't do so bad...and I am glad that it is over with, because now I know my fate. I am saddened that I have to be under house arrest, but I am glad to not be in jail. Because I would be a prison bitch fo sho! At least one of my co-comspirators will likely see jail time...and he will probably have to face that...and I feel somewhat bad for him. However instead of being a man and just facing up to it, he has seemed to choose to be a child and try and get out of it. Not a good way to go. There is no dignity in that at all.  I plan to spend the time learning a lot about web-programming and getting C# under my belt. Cause shit I'll have the time to do it. So expect to see a proper web site soon with a countdown time for all this shit.  Till next time...peace out.

      With friday looming closer and closer I am getting less and less sleep. It is hard to sleep when you know that there is a possibility that you may go to jail for the crime you commited. Plus add to that I have been using sleeping pills for the past five months and my prescription ran out at the beginning of this week forcing me back to my standby yet less effective alternative Benadryl.  I am trying not to worry...but the thoughts of me being a prison bitch just keep looming in my mind. It is hard to envision some large black man named "Big Rob" nicknamed that for his large unit and the offense that he was incarcerated for. It is hard to imagine that might be my next roommate. That is hard to deal with. Again I reiterate that I probably won't be headed to the Fed. Pen. but it is still within the realms of possibility and with my luck you never know.  We had good news from the Prosecutor as they have decided that I should recieve a downward departure from my current offense level (13 if anyone is interested) for being cooperative. However what this means is that it is up to the judge to make that decision. Plus with the health documents we have submitted that will also allow for another downward departure and the prosecution has not objected which is also a good thing...making a possible double downward departure a thing that I can hope for.  Through all of this I have had the support of my mom and grandmother. More than could ever be expected. They have both been thankful that I haven't lied about what was going on and that I have handled this the right way. Both have told me so.   The plain truth of it all is I screwed up. I let them down, I let my friends down, but more importantly I have let myself down. Through my friendliness and willingness to always be a help to people I have constantly gotten myself into cituation which really I shouldn't have gotten into in the first place. This has helped me learn that when it comes to friends that I do have to be guarded and cautious when they are asking for help. It does not mean that I won't help out when someone is in a pickle, but it means that I will not put myself into a situation where I have to compromise what I know to be right. I knew in this instance that my actions were indeed against the law and would place me smack in the middle of something that perhaps I shouldn't have been in. In my own greed and hopes of expanding friendships I compromised what I know to be right and wrong.   I have done many things wrong in my life. I have done many many drugs, and have been caught (yet kept up the behaviour...although I have been pretty clean for some time). It also means that I recognize the things that I have done wrong. Which is more than I can say for some of my friends/former friends.  My plans regardless are to try and not run afoul of the law in the future, but I will not be afraid of the law. It does not mean that I won't break it from time to time, but I will be better suited to deal with the consequences of said actions. I can't promise anything as no one can, but from now on I will try and be a good little doobie. Although I feel some laws are unfair and should be stricken down.  I have but a few regrets in my life. I can count this as part of one of my regrets. That regret is trying to be something I am not, trying to please people that I cannot, trying to make myself more attractive to others when they should accept me the way I am. I will still be a good friend...but a more cautious one, and certainly not the guy to call if you need a car to take a ride in or the guy you give a call when you think you have this great idea that is indeed illegal. Because I won't be your friend in those circumstances. I will be your enemy. I will not be there to help in those cituation.  And with that I will leave you with a qoute I came up with today. It pretty much sums up a lot of things I have been feeling lately.  To those that say "Have Faith"...well faith needs to be validated from time to time, kinda like parking. If you don't get validated sooner or later you will move on to another if not just for the free parking. Me 2003

      ok so it has been a few days since I posted last...bad me.  Well the port was de-accessed a week later than expected so I had to lug all my meds out to hershey with me. That was a pain in the ass, but all is well and things are relatively good now. I am feeling a bit better...altough my cough is worse than ever and has made me puke for the last two days. When I went to the docs this last time I really had impressive lung function scores so that was a bonus...but the drawback is even though I have good scores the important scores which are the small airway passages (the airways that have Alveoli in them) have continued to drop and are now down to 9 percent of what they should be. That score alarms me and now I know why I feel so out of breath during even light excersize (like walking up a flight of stairs).  On Friday I have to go to court to find out what my punishment is...hopefully it won't be to harsh. It really comes down to what the judge orders. The Prosectutor filed a really important document stating that I have been very helpful in the investigation and that they would not oppose a downward departure from my current offense level...all that means is that they have no problem with me getting probation. Again though it comes down to what the judge orders.  While out in Hershey on the way back I stopped at my ex's place in Hanover...she has gotten hotter since I dated her no shit. She trimmed off twenty pounds or so and is rockin...any guy that bags her would be lucky. We had a good visit and she even bought me dinner...which was hella kewl.  Well that is all I have to tell at this point...I will most likely post again after Fridays proceedings to let people know how I faired.  Wish me luck!

      Ok so now I am getting pretty sure about this whole gut thing. I think that it is plugging up fo sho now. It will be a few more days until I am 100% sure but right now I am 90% sure that is the cause of all the problems.  Let me put it this way...imagine constipation times five...but regular things don't work to get rid of this because more than likely it isn't poo that is blocking the way...it is a mucus plug...usually they get about the size of a small fist. Plus it doesn't usually strike in the colon (where it would be easy to get at with a chemical enema) but it strike up way far in the gut where they can only get at it with strong drano like chemicals that either go in through a tube down your nose or another chemical that you can chug. If they can't get it with chemicals they have to cut it out...  Well some of the signs of this happening are extreme gastric pain, constipation for two or more days, fevers, and throwing up what looks like poo from you gut (basically your gut backs up and the only opening available to it is your mouth). Now I have most of the symptoms but not all are presenting as normal...I am constipated but I still pass a little poo now and then...I haven't had a fever (until tonight that is), and the gastric pain has been more in my back than stomach, and I have been throwing up but right now I contribute that to coughing (although what I threw up a few minutes ago would be considered bowel crap).   So over the next few days I will see...if everything I put down tries to come up...then I know that it is blocked...if I double over in screaming pain and my stomach gets distended...then I know it is blocked...if my guts explode and stomach turns green...then I know I am fucked royally.  Night all...and thus ends another glorious day in my life.

      Well Blogger has changed a bit...but it is nicer now.  For the past week I have been having pretty severe pains in my side...they are getting worse day by day. I am really starting to get tired of it. It is almost hindering my moving about the house. So I have spent an inordinate amount of time in bed and on the couch. I know this pisses GM off to no end...because I am being lazy, but hell it hurts like hell!   Tonight it has moved into a new realm. What I was thinking it was may just be and that sucks ass. See previous blogs to see what I thought it was/maybe is. The reason I am leaning more that way is because now the gut it binding up and hurting even more and I haven't gone to the bathroom really well all day. I know it is more info than is needed...but this is my blog damnit!  It would seem that the RIAA is now gone completely nuts. Yes completely nuts. Gone, out to lunch, they all need to be admited to a loony bin. While I have engaged in my fair share of music piracy I still hold the truth that artists need to be paid for their work. Under the current system we buy a CD and they get a small percent of the sale (maybe like a dollar or so from each CD if they are lucky). I would not begrudge them that money at all. I feel that they should get more. However I get really pissed when I spend 15-20 bucks for a CD to get just one or two decent songs. Rarely have I bought Artist CDs that have more than that average. That is why I have changed my listening habits a lot.  First I am not really into the top 20 artists. Not because they don't have catchy tunes. But because to own the right to play that tune anytime I have to buy a CD with maybe a few decent tracks on it. So I have moved over to Techno and Rap and other types of music. With those genres I know what I am getting. I am getting a CD full of something that I will probably like if I like the few catchy tunes that are on the Radio. When there is a top 20 song that I want I wait for a compilation CD to come out with several songs on it that I want. I simply don't bother with buying many artists lone CDs.  Second if I do get a bunk CD with only a couple of decent tunes on it then I burn my own compilation CDs. However the RIAA would not like this practice. Hell if they looked in my car they would find it chock full of cheaply burned compilation CDs that I have made. While this is seen as cheating by the music labels I see it as smart consumerism. I don't want to have to listen to a crap CD or scroll through a CD to get to a song I like. This is partly because I am lazy, and partly because I realize that CD players wear out. Yes folks they do wear out. Hell I wore out three CD players over the years at least. I have one of those old Sony Discmans that cost an arm and a leg yet it can no longer track and play any CD that is put in it. I wore out a Car CD deck. I have worn out CD players in home stereo systems. If I can avoid wearing out any more I would love to do that and they wear out when they have to scroll through CDs full of crap.  Third I try and listen to as many non-signed artists as possible. I would love to pay them all for the music they have given me over the years, but alas I am still poor. So this isn't a reality just yet.  The music industry is corrupt and rife with money grubbing idiots that like to sign crap artists to huge deals so they can get a bonus. Just think of crap artists like Mariah Carey and Michael Jackson. So they have had great songs in the past...but does it justify contracts of 90 million for Mariah or 100 million advances for Michael. Hell no...especially seeing that both are bordering on being insane...if not completely so.  What does this bring me to. It brings me to having to break the law just to get some music in most cases. That sucks.  So what has the RIAA done to go absolutely crazy. Well they have decided since they have sued just about every P2P company out of existance and are now facing stiffer resistance in the courts (recently a lower court held that Kazaa and others of its ilk aren't illigal and are not responsible for the possible infractions going on...kind of like tape players and VCRs in the early days). Instead now the RIAA will be going after the end user. After a recent court victory in favor of producing the identity of a user on Verizon's network they have decided to start suing you and I. That means that if you are a user of any of the current unprotected and un-encrypted networks out there that you may be a target of a lawsuit for sharing music. Right now they are going after the big users sharing the most files. If I were on one of those networks I would certainly fall within that catagory (as I have around 3000 mp3s...most of which I own a CD that has the songs on them). Sooner or later they would get around to suing just the average user...especially seeing that just recently they had rulings in their favor against four college students that were hosting sharing services or searching services on Campus Networks.  The RIAA has essentially declared war on the consumers. Now granted their are a lot of people that use these services and never buy CDs anymore. As I have said that isn't fair and those users should be scared and should have some sort of action against them. However for people like me that do buy music (usually around 12-20 cds a year) would be the target of the very orginization that I help support. That simply isn't right at all.  So what have I done. Well first of all I have moved from the open networks over to a program called WASTE. It is an encrypted file sharing system that only allows for so many users per network and makes it so that you have to authorize anyone who you want to share files with. While this doesn't mean a mole can't wiggle his way into your inner circle it does make it a little more secure. Also with the encrypting that the program does they may be able to monitor your ports and say you are using a lot of bandwidth but hell they can't readily crack the encrypted packets flying out of your machine. The system isn't foolproof and they will eventually find a way to track it...but in the meantime it is better than the current systems. It gives you the user more control over who has access to your files.   Also I have pledged to not buy anymore CDs or at least try not and buy anymore CDs. While my measly CD purchasing contribution each year means nothing to them, it is still that many less dollars that they have to fight this war. I would urge others to do the same. Copy a CD from a friend. Have a few friend pitch in and buy one CD and all of you copy it, tape and then burn songs off the radio, but try and not buy as many copies of CDs that you currently do.   Also get in touch with your representatives and voice your opinions against measures that the RIAA and MPIAA would have introduced into congress.  They are all out of touch with the consumer and it is time that we start telling them that with our dollars and our votes in congress.

      Well...I had one of the most interesting dreams that I have had in a long time last night. It probably was the hottest and most bothered I have gotten in a long time over anyone or anything. Wow!  I had a dream about someone for which I have had an attraction to for quite some time. I am sure she knows about it...its not like I hide it very well. Everytime I get around her (which isn't at all very often...as a matter of fact last time I saw her she was in a coat and there was close to a foot of snow on the ground and I saw her for maybe three minutes) I get all gooey inside. Well I think dirty thoughts about her from time to time....but good christ last night. If what happened in my dream ever ever comes true it will be the most wild excellent thing that ever happens to me period. After that my life would be complete. The only thing that would be better is if we were to go out...but I doubt that will ever happen. For you see I would have to be a better man. I mean by a long shot. I would need to do a lot in my life to elevate it from where it is I fear.   Its not that she would be high maintenance or anything...but I would want to better so that I could be better around her. If you have ever had a person in your life like that then you know what I mean.  Anyway the dream was wild...and I would hope that I could have that dream more often...if only I knew what set it off then I would recreate those circumstances over and over...kinda like a groundhog day of dreams.

      so the last twenty four hours has kinda been a shit day...  For the past couple of days I have had this pain in my side...left side right about where the kidney would be only a little forward of that...it has caused me some severe stress...I am thinking with the recent spreading of the uncomfortable feeling that is currently spreading round the entire belly that maybe I am experiencing another partial or full blockage of the bowel.  Now normally this isn't such a huge deal...but for me I always get the nurse or doctor who thinks that they can get it with an enima...well they can't as these reside far north of where an enima can reach. So what they end up doing is having to give me some sort of turbo lax for days on end to get me flushed through...one good thing about this...is this...if it is a bowel blockage then I will get a hospital stay for it...and if it is a bowel blockage I will get good pain meds...cause they are the only thing that will relieve anyone of the excruciating pain that they cause...  If it is that...I hope they can find the broke piece of bowel and get it out...I know that it would originate from the same area that the four or five prior blockages originated from...so maybe they can rip that piece out and just get rid of the problem area...who knows...  other than that I am me...later today I have to run to the Drug Store and the Bank to get money to pay for drugs...so I will actually get to leave the house justifyably...wooohooo!

      Well yesterday I found out that one of the other people that was in this whole mess with me was also sentenced on Friday. Now I haven't seen him online since then. I don't know what to think about that...I hope he didn't go away...while he may have been more involved in it all (seeing he was the others/ringleaders roommate) I don't think he was as much at fault. Today I read in the paper that he recieved a similar sentence to what I got...but if that is so then why isn't he online...this poses an interesting question. Did he indeed go up the river for this so to speak, and if so for how long?  All of these questions I have and no way to answer them just yet.   Well everything is getting inline here at the house for this six months of sollitude...I have my room arranged a little more comfortably...no the only thing will to bring my TV up here and get it some cable or something. I have a lot of DVD's and Movies to watch so I will be at least somewhat ammused for a bit. Plus with all the money I will be saving by not having to drive around and do shit I will be able to buy so many more DVD's. I can see that Amazon.com and others will become part of my monthly purchases.  I just might sign up for another DVD Club membership to get some movies....hehehehe

      Well I got my room a little cleaner than it has been for a while. It is still a pretty big mess...and I think there is a midget made of funk living somewhere in the room...when I poked a whole in the mess that covered the floor I heard the distinct yell and banshee cry of the "one".   Today has just been a waste of day. Right now I am watching Super Troopers and just changed my keyboard over to my Logitech Cordless Optical that I have had laying around. So we will see how this goes for a while.   Well I am going to clean up a little more and watch this movie.  Peace out...and no I didn't get to meditate. Tomorrow if I get everything done, like moving my TV and Entertainment center and get all that shit set up and connected to the computer of doom. That is what I will call my puter from now on..the computer of doom!  Again...peace out!

      Well I went to another graduation party today and the really hot girl that I had formerly overlooked was there. All I can say is Ka-POW!  Tonight I read part of a guide to get women really hot and bothered over you. It is based on doing it the new-fangled new-aged way of sending out brainwaves (or vibes as I like to call it). Now people might think that this is rediculous...but I would beg to differ based on just some common sense working of the mental powers that some have.   First what is the most common trait of guys that have girls falling all over them? They are all relatively stupid. Think about it for a moment. Yes let it seep into your cranium. Of all the hot guys that have females fawning over them almost all of them have a single trait in common. They are dumb as a brick. I mean come on these guys wouldn't be rocket scientists ever. You have met them. Then think of all the guys that are super smart, even some of the good looking guys. They rarely have females fawning over them. They instead are just kind of introverts with a great personality and whit but rarely get to use it on a girl. Why? Because they are nerds...and classically females avoid nerds at all costs. Now I am not saying that you few females out there aren't into brainiac guys, some of you are, but the vast majority of you don't go for the nerd. Also look at the reverse. Almost all of the good looking girls that have guys fawning over them are pretty dumb as well. The smart girls almost never get any play. Of course there are exceptions to the rule as I call it...but those are few and far between.  Second why is it this way? Well maybe they tap into something more primal or primitave...or maybe it is voodoo. Well not in my universe there has to be something to these rules. Remember rules are meant to be broken.  Now this little read that I did basically states that you need to slow your brain down to a lower operating level, something around 7.83 hertz. The brain natively runs at around 14-30 hertz or so...Now using this logic you see that the average person runs at this speed. Using the old concept of faster is faster and thus more productive I would be that smarter people run at a slightly higher speed (maybe in the 21-30 hertz or maybe higher range) and dumber people run at a slightly lower speed (maybe around 14-21 hertz). This would give them a lower total number to reduce their brains down to this "majical" 7hz rating.   What is this "majical" 7.83hz. Well it is where the natural frequency of the earth resides. We know as fact that the earth hums along at this rate. Now every person has the ability and indeed changes their frequency with normal function around 14-30hz (or Beta Stage). When we enter into sleep we go through several stages (which are well documented). The stage that rests around the 7.83hz mark is considered (which is 7-13hz or Alpha Stage). The other stages are Theta 3.5-7hz and Delta Stage .5-3.5hz.. These stages correspond with sleep Alpha-being around that time when you are just starting to fall asleep (or daydream or meditation), Theta-sleep, and Alpha-deep sleep and dream.  Now if we can get our brains down to that "majical" level we can essentially tap into the earths frequency by just using logic. If we are running at that speed we are running at the speed that the earth does on the eltromagnetic scale. Remember our brains run of electricity. So to tap into this natural energy might not be so far fetched.  Think about this. When you have a short nap you wake up refreshed and ready to go usually. Meaning you have been recharged or maybe your brain is just cooled of a bit (remember that heat is generated by electricity and when you get shocked or struck by lightning it isn't nesecarily the electricity that kills you, it is the heat damage that kills).   At this "majical" number we are essentially plugged into energy that is greater than our own by itself. Now what can be done with this energy? Just about anything!  Now this book tells you to funnel that energy when in that state to do some good...like getting a girl all hot and bothered for you. There are many steps to achieving this, but all in all the technique is relatively simple overall.   We hear about Martial Arts masters being able to do all sorts of things that seem superhuman, and what do all Martial Arts masters have in common. They all do some sort of meditating. Plus you always hear them say "center yourself" fight not in anger but from a centered place. The same could be said about "Christian Healers" or those that pray for others, they are practicing a form of meditation (by praying and concentrating on what they are praying for). The Bible even mentions meditating for God's glory or something like that. Through mediation we esentially lower our brain wave activities to these lower levels and some people get to the "majical" number easily through this technic.   While the book claims that you can essentially heal and do all sorts of ill shit when we are at that level (some of which I debate to be valid until proven) it would make sense to some degree. When does the body heal itself? When we sleep!  So bringing it around to the argument that dumber people are more attractive to the opposite sex we see that they have a lower level to drop and smarter people have to drop much further to get to the level that a lot of dumb people are at even on a regular day to day basis.   When a dumb guy gets drunk he is essentially bringing his brain waves down to a semi-concious dream state buy default and taps into that power, because lets face it what happens to most when they get drunk? They get horny to boot. So when a dumbie is drunk and horny for a particular person they are sending out these signals fairly easily. That is why it is almost always easier to hook up when drunk. Think about it...it is true. The smarter person has still to make it to this level whenever they are drunk as they naturally function faster. Which when trying to bring down the frequency with alcohol you run into barriers such as alcohol poisoning.   So through meditation we may be able to get our levels down to this "majic" number.   You might say that once you are at that level then you are essentially asleep. Well I beg to differ. Ever asked someone a question when they are daydreaming or napping. Sometimes you get a responce that may be way off the wall...but you always get some sort of responce...even if it is only a look or nod. Try it sometime...you may be surprised.  Well I am going to try this out and see what happens...because you know I need all the help I can get. I have several people that I will try this on. One will be easy to get the info out of...the other almost as easy...and the third one will be blind to the attempt so we will have to see what happens.   This will delight one of my friends that I am trying it...because also at the same time I will try and think healing thoughts and see what happens. Again I will be able to tell this easily because I am me...and I know my body well.  I will of coarse post my results as time goes on. In the meantime I need to find a mp3 of the sounds that help you get into this mode as you can change your brain mode by just listening to noise or music (we all know this to be true...listen to a slow relaxing song and you will be relaxed, listen to something faster and heavier and you will notice that you may be more alert...something many of us have done when on our way home late at night sleepy).  Well I am off to find that mp3 to help...and to all of you non-believers out there hopefully if I see results you might start to believe. Because as humans we know less than we think and their are many things out there we can't explain but accept.

      So today I went with my grandmother to a graduation party for one of her students. I had to take her because she wasn't feeling so great and wasn't up to driving her.   Imagine this...pale skinny white ass me in amongst a gaggle of very good looking young nubile 18 year old women...and a few that were younger. Woah momma! I was kinda shocked because mostly I see these students of my grandmother and they are not always made up and just kinda schleppin along (which even then most all of them are ultra hot), but I got to see them today all dolled up. If I had been feeling just a little better I would have had a very large hard on simply because I have not been around that much fine ass in a long long time...maybe a frat party once, but it has been a long ass time.   The student graduating was Cara and she is a fox admittedly...plus she is super super talented. I tell you this woman is just a damn artistic genious. She paints, sings, acts...all of it and she is just absolutely amazing at it all. She has brains along with it. I tell you she will definitely do well in whatever venture she decides on doing in the future. I have always been impressed by her talent and today I was able to see all the art that she has worked on over the years. She is talented...and whoever snags her in the future will be one lucky mofo....put simply she is a great human being.  Yesterday was another girls graduation which I sadly missed...I wasn't feeling up to it, however looking back I should have gone. I have seen her in here before but never really paid attention to her. God damn is she fine. She is cute as a button and has a nice ass. You know the kind of ass that you look at then look away then look at again to make sure it is really there...wow! It was nice to see her to say the least. I guess at some point when I went to get my grandmother a drink she asked her if my tongue was pierced...my grandmother didn't answer I don't think but told her to ask or something like that. Well lemme tell ya little youngin it is...and it has many many good uses...I can be skilled with it when needed. I sure am glad all these girls are 18 now...because damn I would feel just soooo wrong if they weren't.  Tomorrow I have to take her to another graduation party. This girl I don't know but all of the others will be there...which is kewl because I won't be the biggest dork in the world...or something like that. I guess they all see me as an inigma or something because they have some sort of strange reverence towards me...or something like that...if they only knew that I was just a lazy ass twenty something...sick and lonely...hahahaha...and if only they knew some of the things I will be thinking about them ;-)  Anyways not to brag to much or anything but I was one of the best looking guys there...I mean sure there were larger hulkier guys there...but they were all just goofy looking and some were plain out fugly...so it gave me some confidence...at least I knew I was one of the better looking guys and if we were all forced to pick partners to be with if we were the last people on the earth I wouldn't be last this time! YAY!  Anyways I am tired and I need to rest...even though I sleep on average 12-14 hours a day now...not because I want to but because I have to...it sucks ass so bad...if only I had a little energy left...I would chase those girls in the bushes...or something like that ;-)  If there are any little green alien guys out there that would like to abduct me and fix all my bad parts, add 30 pounds to my body, and insert a vast amount of computer knowledge into my brain...well then go ahead and take my ass...you can probe anything you want anytime!

      Retraction...the qoute I posted from that persons info was actually from a Beastie Boys song...so it was not his original work. And the point of this website is to be about me...and me alone...thus the name "A Day in the life of..." Blog. The only thing this blog is designed to do is simply let people into my relatively small little world such as it is at this point as I don't go out much (right now because of house arrest) and even before because of deteriorating health.   I don't drink very often and now haven't drank in months...drugs have been cut out of my life for a long time as well. As a matter of fact I have few vices outside of Pepsi and Spaghetti O's. So this is my lifeline to the outside...excuse me if I use it as a platform to tell the truth.   I still haven't sat down to write that thing...maybe I will drag my laptop downstairs and write it out...jeesh I have a lot to do...  But I still stand by my earlier statements...I may be a dick...but at least I am not a weasel.

      Today I finally found out that SprintPCS has added AIM to its list of services...this makes me mucho happio...and when I signed on to an old name that I still keep active from time to time I found my ex-roommate and soon to be federal inmate online (well I presume he will be a federal inmate as he is pretty screwed)...so then I signed on to that account not from my phone but computer to read the info that he has posted up...and I qoute  "Can't stand it I know you planned it Ima set it straight This Watergate" What a poet...hahahahaha...anyways I have an idea who it is aimed at...or rather the parties it is aimed at...my simple response to it is this...I planned nothing, there is nothing to set straight you are guilty as sin...and whats with the Watergate reference...everyone knows that Nixon was involved with that and it was a leading factor in him leaving office...so are you saying that your guilty...  Anyways enough of that...  I have had my fill of laughs for the evening...peace ya'll

      Well the pills last night finally did kick in...and when they did they made me sooo dizzy that I thought I was gonna throw up hard...I didn't...instead my lung started to bleed a lot...and looking at that maybe it was the slight blood loss that made me really dizzy (my blood count is always low as I leak like a siv).  Today the US Probation office came and put my leash on. The guy is really nice and I am thinking of cronicleing the next six months...maybe he won't mind if I mention his name. However I have to run that by him to see if he cares...plus obviously it would be transparent...if I talk shit then he would most certainly know. But again he is really nice and laid out a few ground rules...plus he told me that I am not gonna be a hermit cause he will be somewhat flexible as long as I be straight with him...and I do plan to be straight up with them all...cause I ain't gonna lie I don't wanna revoke this and have my ass end up in jail.  Well I dunno what now...maybe I will find some amusing shit to get myself into on the internet over the next few months...I have a lot of time and some energy to get rid of...plus in the next month or so I will be really starting to get my Ebay thing going...I have a lot of stuff to get rid of...baseball, basketball, football collectables for my mom and friend...so that will take up some time and I will make some money wooohoooooo!  Well peace out...tomorrow I promise I will write that thing again that was a masterpiece...plus this time it will have all the correct spelling and grammer and will contain more than I had originally wrote.  Peace

      Well sleeping pills would be great if they worked as prescribed...but they don't of coarse...they just kinda make you tired...so I am going to take another type and try and sleep...maybe that will work in connection with the other one I took a few hours ago.

      Ok so later today the US Probation office is coming to put the leash on me...aww this is gonna suck big time. Being stuck in the house with my grandmother for the next 6 months is sure to drive me absolutely mad.  Funny thing is I am getting a lung infection and I may have to take the leash off to go to the hospital soon...life is Ironic

      Well I haven't yet rewritten my literary work of art yet...maybe later tonight I will concentrate and try to write it.  Not to much has been happening around here.   My sister did finally get up here. She brought with her new toys for me to play with. A Sony Camera (very swanky indeed) and a PocketPC by Viewsonic. She needs some apps for the PocketPC so I downloaded a shitload of development apps for it. Overall the downloads totaled around 500megs from Microsoft (they are all free development apps surprisingly enough). The only thing that I wasn't able to download was Visual Studio .NET which I already have the Architect Edition...so I am in the butter zone so to speak. Now I just have to sit down and do a little coding and try to get what she needs up and running.  The apps are basic calculators for Vet Medicine. One is for figuring out dosages for animals based on weight and the other is a subset, dosage dilluted into another substance by weight. They are all in the microgram level...so that will be interesting to get all the calculations written down then coded. I am looking forward to it because really when it comes to programming a calculator is probably one of the easiest things to figure out...the only difficult part will be GUI as I have never done any GUI programming...everything I have done was text based. So it will be a learning experience to say the least but I am looking forward to coding it out.   Plus it will give me some coding experience on PocketPC's which are fast becoming the standard for handheld devices. If I get semi-good at doing it on PocketPC then I will learn about PalmOS programming...which is a little different and with much different programming apps.  Well I am off to dinner...something down there must be for me to eat...must eat I am...

Right now I am watching Robin Williams Live on Broadway...it is funny shit. I love watching the comedy master at work.

      So I finally wrote out the masterpiece as I will call it...well it isn't nearly as good as the original because this time I was trying to write something Earth shattering...I don't think it will have the same effect as the first version.   Basically it is my religion as I call it. My views and beliefs. I finished it up yesterday as my sister was screaching into the driveway making my a sound that I never like to hear my car do.  I will put the laptop back on the network later today and get it posted. It was something like three pages in MS Word.  Well something happened to me that I certainly didn't expect this last Sunday. My grandmother planned a surprise birthday party for my sis and I. Now I had known about it for a while so it wasn't in and of itself a surprise, but what was surprising were all the people that showed up. Even more surprising is that she was able to get consent from the Probation Office for me to go to it at a local resteraunt. Now I would never have expected that because the whole point of being on house arrest is to keep you in the house, but as I stated before my Probation Officer is really nice and was kind enough to let me go.   I got all sorts of gifts (which I hate that all those people spent or gave money to me) and all of them are greatly appreciated. I recieved 95 bucks in cash and 70 bucks worth of Gift cards to Sheetz and Hollywood Video, plus some other assorted stuff including a T-Shirt that is da' bomb and a really unique gift of a bath plug.   A bath plug? Well you see that is from my neighbor. When I was over fixing their family computer about two months ago he was teasing me that if I lost anymore weight that I would fall through my asshole. He kept this up for the two hours I was there. He packed it in multiple boxes that were harder to get into as I got further in the package, making it a challenge for me. On top of it he gave me his dull pen knife to cut into it making it all that much more difficult.   I was really shocked by all of it. It was a really nice thing to have seeing that I have only had three other birthday parties ever. One was my own, the other was a combined party that really was my sisters party, and the third was my 21st which I had at school. Now I have this one to add. Even though it did not include copious amounts of alcohol it was probably the most fun I have had in a while.   I also recieved an instant message from one of my friends that was also involved in this whole mess we are dealing with. It was nice to hear from him and his message was also very nice in that he told me to keep my chin up and hoped that I would start feeling better (or something to that effect). As I have always been towards him and this is true I hope all is well in his circle, and I hope that he continues to do well. After all this mess I think that we may have learned a pretty valuable lesson. First is to stand up and take the blame for what we had done. Second that friends are only friends when they don't try and screw you for things that you haven't done (as one other party involved in this all seemingly tried to blame everyone else and took a damn long time to stand up and take it on the chin...although I see his point of view seeing that he may be facing serious jail time.)  As has always been my schtick in the past. I certainly don't hold grudges. It is to time consuming and if you hold them sooner or later they come back and bite you in the ass. Even after all this shit I don't blame anyone but myself and I freely and willingly stood up and admitted what I had done, but no more than what I had done.   Friends help you out when you are in a pickle, but never ever expect friends to take a fall for you in situations like this especially if they aren't as involved. Also don't ever expect to friends to take even a minor fall for you if you treat them like shit several times over, and then talk shit about them. (Now I do not know for a fact nor would I claim that one person talked shit about me. However saying that I know this party well enough to know that he has probably said some things about me that weren't very nice. The problem is that for the people that know both myself and this other person they know that I am not in anyway the way what he would describe me as. I am a dick, I am a prick, I am many things, but I don't screw people over to make my cituation better. I have done many things that I am not proud of. Shit there are things that I would change, but I emphasize that I don't screw people over for my betterment. It just doesn't pay.)  Enough of that for now...I am reactionary so things do tend to excite me...and occasionally I like to try and stir shit up just for reactions...but again that is me being a dick, but you won't find me claiming anything outragious or outright lieing about people.  As for my health. That is a mixed bag. My lung infection is getting worse...very slowly but surely. I don't know when it will reach the "I need a hospital" point right now as this lung infection is very different from the ones in the past. It seems to be eating very little at a time, but it is feeding. As for that pain in my side it has gone away for the most part. I don't know what it was at all. I thought it might be a bowel obstruction but it wasn't. Maybe it was a fluke thing, or maybe a sign of something to come. Either way it wasn't pleasant and I hope not to be in that kind of discomfort again for some time. If it does re-occur then I will definitely call the Docs and get something for the pain as it certainly interfered with my life.   Till later today...I'm outie

      Well all of today has sucked serious donkey balls...I am getting sick and there is nothing I can do about it except wait for it to get bad enough to head to the hospital. For you see they are almost out of drugs to treat my little bugs with...the stuff that is left that works better than the stuff now is penecillian based...and well I am allergic to Penicillian...so when I get sick this time it has to be bad because they will have to drag me in to treat me for penicillian allergies (try to reduce the effects of my reaction) and then treat me with the drugs...  Well trying to get me to tolerate Penicillian drugs will be dangerous to say the least...I swell like and Oscar Mayer weiner...or a Ball Park Frank...plus I get all itchy and it just isn't any fun at all...last time I had a reaction I was swollen and had hives for a week and a half before the stuff worked its way out of the system...so this time I dunno what will happen. I just have to wait and see...  Tomorrow will be an interesting day as I will be getting even more ill...  Illin' like a villian ya'll

      spent most of the day in bed...at least until 3PM...tonight I will actually get to bed at a reasonable time as I need to be up for tomorrow...my mom will be back from MS and has a truck load of collectables to be unloaded, semi-cataloged, and packed away again...  Today I almost finished cleaning up my room...I at least got my TV, Stereo, VCR up here and set up. That was a freakin chore...now I have it all hooked up and I have my computer tied to the TV which allows me to watch all sorts of videos from my PC on my TV...that is so freakin money yo!   Plus I can play games on the TV screen as well...and that is kewl as hell! SOF2 actually looks good on my TV...all I would need to do is stretch my keyboard and mouse over to my bed and play from there so I would be in front of the TV...I may give myself the ability to do this once I get some extension cords for both my mouse and keyboard...I have one I just need the second one.  Right now I am updating this blog, looking for a cheap price on Ebay for a Nikon Coolpix SQ (neat little camera), and getting ready to hit the sack (my meds are kicking in).  I need a new camera and the Coolpix SQ would fit the bill 3.1Megapixel Camera, teeny tiny in size, and has a lot of cool features...I think I will try and get one this week as I have a lot of photos to take of all these collectables...already have my scanner set up, just need the camera to really get all those things moved...  It looks like there will be many items that will sell for close to a grand or more...and plenty of other things to sell...  That makes me happy cause my mom could use the cash, I can use the cash and get some of the things I need to...like new laptop and a digital camcorder, and maybe a TabletPC...maybe I will be able to fullfill all my gadget wishes by the end of the year! YAY!

      Also I would like to quickly mention that Dean is the first candidate to really cater to the online world...the rest have pages...but Dean's team has really made it their base of operations...  Think about it...each month they may spend 50grand on Bandwidth but get huge penetration into the market.  To put a thirty second spot on TV it would cost many times that just to get it in the primetime slots...while I am sure we will see comercials for him...I really think that he is being fiscally responsible by going the major web route...he is able to just simply get more bang for the buck this way...so look at his site often and inform your friends and family.  This blog will start to become a podium of sorts to get Bush out and Dean in...it is time for a change...stand up, take charge, grow a pair, and help get this Tyrant out of office...it is the Patriotic thing to do.

      Today I cleaned the garage, cleaned my room, and nearly died of a coughing fit...  I hate cleaning but I love clean...I need to be extremely rich or really lucky...if I was rich I would have maids that would keep things clean (plus I would treat them good and pay them well...they would really be part of my family)...or if I was lucky I would have a female that would clean up for me and then lay me...  That's right I am horny again...well kinda. Wanna have sex but don't want to expend the energy to actually get it or have it...I want a new drug like Huey Lewis...I wanna sex pill that gives all the physical pleasures without the actual act having been made...it would be like this.  Step one. Pop the pill. Step two. Wait ten minutes. Step three. Look some porn. Step four. Get off (without any physical activity or even mess) Step five. Smoke a cigarette and go to bed.  That would be the best drug ever.  I also want a drug that makes me feel better. They have it now...it is called Vicodan. Now I just need to get some.  Maybe when all this house arrest shit is over I will go and find a woman to bang...and then hopefully bring home.  Think about it.

      Oh and a just yesterday I saw a show on either FSTV (Dish Network 9415) or Worldlink TV (Dish 9410) that was about the Raeleons or whatever they are called...they seem to have similar beliefs to the higher power as I do...however I don't go as far as saying that aliens are our gods...because I don't know for sure...but whatever...call me a crackpot but I don't care...cause I tolerate your beliefs...  also a couple more links for those of you who believe that the government is up to no good.   Conspiracy? You Decide!   A Little Weirder and off the Wall

      Today I was able to get a almost two hour reprive from House Arrest as I was able to go out and get a few things. I didn't get everything done that I needed to but I did accomplish a few things.  The only comfort about this whole house arrest thing has been that I have internet access...outside of that it has been pretty torturous...I mean I am locked in the house with my grandmother 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Now as some of you that have known me for a long time may recall that I go pretty nuts when I am confined with her. Well it is happening again.  Not having had sex in well over two years is also playing a factor in that. Last time I was confined like this at least it was only a month since I had last had sex...but now with all those pent up tensions it is starting to wear on me a lot more than I initially factored. I think that I will go ahead and seek counseling again as I have in the past...not really to work things out, but to just get out of this friggin house more often...also I have a lot of medical appointments that I have to make so that will also get me out a little more often. Maybe I can swing it that I get out once a week to do these things.   On a brighter note though my grandmother is looking into buying another house here in Springdale PA. This house would be for me as I qualify for Section 8 housing assistance and that would essentially pay for her to get another place...it would be an investment for her, and a way out for me. I would finally be able to get out of this place and maybe get myself a little more established. I would finally have my own domain...that would be very nice indeed...so on the off chance that I would meet a suitable woman then I can have her over without being a total dork living in my grandmothers house.   Also this coming week my mom will be getting back from her jaunt to MS. When she comes back I will have the monumental task of selling a ton of collectibles like baseball cards, action figures, bobble head thingies, basketballs signed by teams. This would help her out by giving her some money that she needs...and it would also be a way for me to make some money as I would get a percentage of everything sold.   Today outside of going out was uneventfull as usual. I just laid around and listened to my lungs gurgle as they fill with sticky mucus that is surely getting infected and will soon land me in the hospital.  The other evening I saw one of those news shows like Dateline or something like that. They had a feature on a girl who just recently died of the disease that I am fighting. She had a double lung transplant and things were looking up for her until her body started to reject the organs...While I am comfortable with the fact that I will die soon I found myself eirily moved by her story as it was really similar to mine. She also attempted college but was eventually forced to quit because of health (and that is one of the many reasons I quit as well...maintaining a decent GPA and being very ill and in the hospital is very challenging). While I am sure that she took much better care of herself than I ever have it brought me to a conclusion.  I will not have any organ transplants. Even if the outcome would look bright I simply would not want one. I already wasted my lungs to many things...like smoking pot and other things over the years. Now I know this seems suicidal to do this considering that I have a lung disease...but really I don't care what people think about it. Marijuana experiences are among the best memories that I have in my life. It brought many good things into it...mainly through the bonding that I did with people while high.   Some have questioned why I would do such a stupid thing knowing that it would make me sick and land me in the hospital if I did those things. The only answer that I have for that is that I was looking for something fun and something that brought me a little happiness. Drugs did just that. They gave me some great memories (as well as a few I would love to forget), but more importantly I was happy when I was doing them. When I cut them out of my life for a period of six months I saw a very sharp downward spiral in my mental health. It was not that I was addicted to anything because I did not crave any of the drugs that I have done...it was the feeling they gave me that I longed for. They were like a majical happy pill. Overall they were much better than any anti-depressant that they ever put me on. If I could only smoke pot I would be in much better mental state...or even pain meds...those are truely miracle drugs in my mind.   Of all the drugs that I have done I still am in love with pain meds...the legal kind prescribed by physicians. Not only did they take away the daily pain that I am in, but they also elevated my mood to levels that would be considered normal by comparisons...In other words I wasn't depressed at all when I would take pain meds.   People may say that I could fall into a pit of being dependant on them or addicted to them...however I beg to differ. First of all I didn't do them as a recreation...like I wouldn't pop a few pills and go out to socialize or party on. I would take two Vicodans in the morning and the mood that they induced would last all day and maybe I would take one at dinner time to round out the evening. I did this regularly when the drugs were around for me to use. Not once did I experience a loss of effect even when on them for extended periods of time. When I ran out I did not find myself physically craving them either...instead it was more like my body was taking a break...but my mood certainly suffered when I didn't have access to them.  During my experimentation with prescription drugs I found that the perfect combination was 20mg of Valium and two 500/5mg Vicodan in the morning with another 10 of Valium and 500/5 of Vicodan in the evening. This gave me the ability to make it through a day without being depressed and gave me the ability to function as a somewhat normal person...alleviating pains that I have everyday...but also giving me that ability to just deal with things in a more rational matter...things didn't upset me and I was calmer...plus my brain slowed down sufficiantly to the point where it was not always racing.  Another plus was that all of my screaming migraines stopped when on this combo...Migraines I might add that were brought on by a seizure that was caused by an Anti-Depressant that I was on (Wellbutrin). I have a headache everyday when I wake up and it usually goes to a migraine by mid-day that will continue for several hours...while they do not completely bring me down...they certainly cause a lot of stress in my brain.  I may have to request that I go on this coctail so that I can function a little better in the world...and I would definitely need it if I were to actually obtain a job.  Speaking of jobs the rest of this week I may go over my resume' and then start hitting up companies in a vain attempt to find employement...but that will depend on my health over the next few weeks...  I see a hospital stay of a week or more in my near future...my lungs are bleeding pretty badly now...and I definitely have seen a decrease in lung function overall...as I can barely make it up the steps of this house without huffing and puffing and coughing after the climb...and that is after I do my treatments...  Well I am out for the eve...got some shit to do tomorrow...like clean the garage slowly to allow for all these collectibles to be close to me for Ebay Auctions...  Peace

      So I wrote some more stuff today on the economy and maybe why we aren't seeing a recovery in the Job market even though the economy is techincally growing.   It is a very difficult subject to get into really. What I would need to do to make it a little better of a read would be to do some actual research on all of it to get together numbers so it would look a little more official.   I wonder how many of you out there actually read through the discourse I wrote about religion. I would love to hear from some of you out there in CyberLand...  You may have noticed that I changed the layout ever so slightly....in the right hand corner area you will find a couple of actual links...I will update them as I come across things that are interesting...also I have my email addy posted...just click on it and it will launch your default email client so you can email me....feel free to email anytime. I will usually respond quickly...  Also the first link over there is a link to the Howard Dean Campaign page...After having looked through his page and over his topics I find that he seems to  be pretty balanced out there...I would only hope that he gets the Democratic Nomination as he would be the best to actually take on Bush and his Neo-Con friends...  I used to be a Republican...until this administration got in there and started yanking away many civil liberties, lowering taxes on the people that can afford to pay a few extra bucks, leading us into a war that we cannot win (the war on terrorism....just think have we won the war on drugs yet?), and the seemingly endless amount of nepotism towards companies affiliated with the Bush administration. It brought me to relize that the Republican party is not a good thing to be part of at this point.   Are the Democrats any better? Well I don't really know that they are. They have been in the past all for Gun Banning and many other things that I am most certainly against...but right now they would seem to be the party that is the lesser of two evils...so here is a note to the Democrats...get your shit together or you may find yourselves on the lists that the Ashcroft Justice department is building that considers people who don't fall in line with the administrations ideals as enemies...and if you are on that list you may find yourself loosing your citizenship because of being a Democrat...sounds harsh right? Well believe me if the Administration gets everything it wants then that scenario would be very easy to imagine...  Whatever you vote for in the coming presidential election just make yourself more informed as to who these people are affiliated with...remember that both parties absolutely hate when a voter is actually informed about the issues and what their candidates stand for....instead both major parties would like you to believe what the PR departments put together for them...with a little research anyone can become what I will call a Dangerous Voter...  New Definition: Dangerous Voter: adj, verb: A voter that does his/her homework and becomes informed on what candidates have stood for in the past, a voter that is willing to vote against party lines as long as it is for the beterment of the nation, a voter that uses their vote as currency in our democracy forcing politicians to trade in nothing but the truth and do the voters bidding, a voter that is not affraid to confront any elected official and call them on campaign processes even if the elected official is in the middle of a speecha and that speech may hold information that is contrary to the actions of the official.

      My theory on Religion and what my resulting religion is.  So here it is.  Q: Do you believe in God, if not what do you believe in? A: Yes and no. I believe in a higher power. Some religions call this thing God, Allah, Jehovah, Buddha, whatever. I call it a higher power. I dont really call it any of those things. By labeling it anything other than the higher power would be limiting that power into someone elses predefined small little black box description of it. By doing that we limit the power and what it can and cannot do. For me to limit this unknown power seems a little silly.   Q: Do you believe your higher power is directly involved as most religions believe? A: No. For me to believe that any higher power is directly involved in every little thing that goes on here on Earth would be silly. It really is silly in my opinion to believe in that. Maybe I am wrong but I really doubt there is this big ole dude up there sitting and moving pieces around a chess board. I would hope that we have a little more power over our own lives then that.  Q: What is your credo? A: Well I would like to think that I have started to live by a simple code. That you try and treat others as they would treat you. I do believe that the Ten Commandments that are in the Christian Bible are a good roadmap. They lay out a simple code that people should aspire to live to. Now mind you not everyone can do that and live exactly to that code. I wish that we all could because if we did live up to those ideals then we would all be living in a much better world.   Which brings me to this ideal. From what I have read and heard from all the scholars out there most religions preach peace and tolerance. However how much peace and tolerance do you see between all the various religions now a days? Look at the middle east for example. What is that all about? It is simply about religion. The Jews hate the Muslims and the Muslims hate the Jews, and the Christians dont like any of them. Hell there is infighting in the religions. You have the Sunnis, the Kurds, Shiites. We have Baptists, Catholics, Protestants, Lutherans. We have all these different sub versions of the same religions that dont get along. Yet all of the religions preach one simple thing, TOLERANCE. If they would all have a little tolerance then maybe we could get a little further.   Q: So who is your higher power? A: Well I really dont know or really care exactly what it/he/she/they may be. I just know that there is a higher power out there. What or who it is really isnt something that I can really even give an idea without sounding like a crackpot.   Q: Do you believe in evolution? A: Yes, but not to the extent that we all came from a puddle of goo. Evolution is pretty much a fact. We can see throughout time how things have evolved and to think that it is not true or to deny it is really like trying to deny that the Earth revolves around the Sun or some other thing that we know as fact.   So if I dont believe that we evolved all the way from goo then where do I think we came from? Well I do believe that the higher power did indeed have a hand in us coming about. However I believe it is much different then it going poof your there. I believe that it was more of a seeding than anything else. He/she/it/they dropped off a bunch of DNA samples or actual critters and then let it go. Almost like a giant science experiment. That the higher power is more or less a scientist would make sense to me. In other words as a good scientist the higher power only really intervenes whenever absolutely necessary otherwise it just lets the experiment run and it will to its conclusion.   Q: Do you believe in Christ or the son of God? A: Yes as a matter of fact I do. However I dont believe in it as deeply as religion would like me to believe it. I believe that in fact these people that pop up throughout various religions who are sons of god or gods themselves; that they are emissaries to us from the higher power that is out there. Indeed they may have powers that we may not have such as healing and the ability to walk on water. Who really knows? I believe though that they were sent as emissaries to kind of guide us and give us some pointers along the way. Unfortunately we havent listened to them and have pretty much gone about our own way. These are the times that I believe that the higher power has actually tried to get involved not so much to control, but more to guide and see what happens. Again unfortunately we havent really heeded those ideals brought forth by those emissaries. It is rather unfortunate for us really.  So where does this leave me? For me really it gives me the option of expanding my ideals as my personal knowledge grows. It gives me the ability to adapt to new ideals and situations quickly and without much religious fervor. It gives me the ability to see many different points of view on religion yet be able to look at them all and see the remarkable similarities between them all.   I am open to all peoples views as none of them really interfere with my own in that we all believe in very similar things except maybe we just call it different things. This also gives me the remarkable ability to worship anywhere. Although I really dont worship.   In the end I just think that we can believe in whatever we want to believe in. If it makes you feel more comfortable to believe in some all knowing all powerful being than so be it. However if you are going to look at it like that then also look at the underlying religion and ascribe to the basics of it. Which in most of them are Love and Tolerance of all your fellow human beings. In the end that is all my religion asks of you. It doesnt care about the knitpicky things. What it desires is that you treat those around you with some respect, but also acknowledges that it may not be possible to be this way all the time.  The last thing that I need to address is death. What do I believe in?  This is really hard to say. I dont think we just die and thats it. I think we do move on to something else but I am not really sure what it is.  There is an idea that involves quantum physics and some really advanced science stuff that basically says that things are mirrored throughout the universe and this may be the way it is with our brains. That when we die essentially our consciousness moves on even though we are technically dead. I remember seeing a program on Discovery or TLC about it and thinking that it was a reasonable explanation. Maybe the energy that makes up our soul our consciousness stays together even after we die and it moves onto something else, another plain. This kind of fits in with my everything must have an explanation way of thinking. If we move on after words that means we are still together somewhere out there. Now that leaves open the possibility that we can still communicate in some form or fashion. This doesnt mean I believe in Psychics whole heartedly, but it does leave open the possibility that they arent all full of shit.  I consider these ideals to be well balanced and something that I can carry through on a daily basis. It does not make me hate anyone because of their beliefs as some religions do. It helps me want to understand the world and universe around me instead of just accepting that some all knowing being has it all planned out for me. It makes me want to be engaged in life and learn from my mistakes. After all why were we given free will if that great power already had everything planned out for us? If free will wasnt in us then most certainly I would believe that everything was planned out and would be fear stricken if it werent all planned out for me.   Maybe that is the human condition or sickness. Maybe we really wish we didnt have free will, because if we didnt have it then all would be planned and easy for us. Since we have it we have made our lives hugely more difficult to execute. Personally I like having free will, because it gives me license to question things, make fun of stuff, and really live freely.

      I am booting up the laptop as I write this. So I will finally be able to say that I have my thesis on religion up and online. Damn passwords...laptop...typing here...there...jeesh it would be nice to have one keyboard, mouse, and monitor station for all your computers...this may signify the idea that I might need to soon invest in a KVM switch...  here are my plans for the near future...hopefully over the rest of this year.  First: Get a laptop...nice big desktop replacement type for the road. Sager system with Dual Channel DDR 2.4+ P4 HT ATi Graphics, gig o ram Second: Build a new mini-system like I have now based around a Shuttle XPC with Dual Channel DDR and 3.0+ P4 HT and dual 17 inch flat panels ATi Graphics, gig o ram Third: Wireless Gear 802.11G based or better...a system that supports all the subsets of 802.11 Fourth: Cheapy Tablet PC (some will be coming out this year that are under the 1 grand mark) Fifth: Build from Scrap parts that I have a server up for serving media using drives out of current main machine (think sophisticated NAS) and maybe basic Web-Serving capabilities (but file serving comes first). Sixth: Get a cheap PocketPC Seventh: Get a decent Digital Camera (at least better than what I have now as it eats 10 batteries every twenty minutes) Eigth: Get a decent but cheap Digital Camcorder Nineth: Get a backpacky type thing that will hold all the portable things...and still be somewhat comfortable (hopefully loaded weight will be less than 20 pounds with the laptop, tablet pc, pocket pc, camera, and camcorder, and all the extra cords and crap for them all plus a wireless bridge for when I get to a place that has broadband but no wireless....roll my own network on the fly)  The laptop will be in the 2 grand range, the Tablet in the 1 grand range, the new PC, in the 1500 range, Pocket PC in the 400 range, Camera 350, and camcorder 600 or so...gimme bout eight grand and I could have them all...now mind you I have a lot of work coming up this fall...and I should be able to swing at least a few of these things...I don't need them all...but they would be nice...this is just a wish list...  Oh and I wanna get a new Cell Phone later this fall...I am going to continue with Sprint but I want to get a Digital Camera Phone...and a pittsburgh number...my current number is an Indiana PA number...  ok...ok...so now for what some have been waiting for...lemme post this and then I will post the writing I did.

      Ode to the Lung.  Bloody lung I feel your pain Bloody lung you drain my veins In the course of the many years I have treated you shitty Now I shed a tear Bloody lung you teach me at last The you are just a Bloody lung with a spotted past.  Ok so I am no poet...but that is what is up today...bloody lungs are giving me hell...everything I cough up today has friggin blood in it. I may start to make some art out of it or something...I will cough all this crap onto a canvas then laquer it so the colours stay...then I will sell it on Ebay...  I am going to try and get some sleep...sleep is a fleeting thing for me...while I sleep a lot it never seems to be enough...I could sleep 18 hours a day and still be tired. My body is weak and it tires my soul. Yes I do have a soul.   I am just hoping that soon all of this will be past...  *Done waxing philosophically*

      Well at least I know one person reads this blog. Thank you for messaging me :-)  In the course of one day I went from happy, placated, farely well adjusted about being me to a complete shambles.   Of coarse my brain has everything to do with that. It kicked into overdrive after writing this afternoon about my dreams. Everything about being spent and not having the energy or real drive to expend energy of coarse got me thinking. What shall I do then?  I really wish somebody could give me the answer because it really is tormenting me right now.   Tomorrow I am going to play some more Go (the game that John Nash created)...or at least the game is based on his idea...and I will try and solve the problem behind it. That problem is a strategy that consistantly wins. If I solve that problem then I solve one of the most difficult problems in Math the "P = NP"...if you don't get it then head to this website  "P=NP" Problem   I certainly don't understand all of it but maybe that can kill some time...learning to understand it.

      I just woke up from the strangest set of dreams I think I have had in a long while.  It was a series in which I would get into a dream, wake up then fall back asleep and continue the previous dream. Strange I tell you.  What was the subject of this dream. Its more like who was the subject of it.   These dreams were about my ex Beth. So here goes the entire set of dreams.  In my dreams she was about to marry some dude that I never got to see in the dream. I wasn't going to have that and I was going to stop the wedding. Almost "Freshman" style without the church and banging on the glass. Anyways I ran into her at a mall and she was surrounded by security people almost like police. When I got close I just said to her "does he make you laugh like I do" (a similar line of that in Oceans Eleven). We get into a short conversation and she then alarmedly tells me to scram cause he was on his way back and wouldn't be happy if I was there. Pretty soon the security people see me and start chasing me through the mall. I give good chase (here is a little note for you out there. I would love to be able to run and it is little dream of mine but my lungs are so fucked that I can't run or be physical more than a mear minute before collapsing from oxygen deprivation...I need to work on that but I doubt I will ever be able to be physical again...it is really frustrating.).   I get to a store and now hear that the police are chasing me as well because the security must have called them and said something, because the police thought I had a gun and was on the hunt for me. I get to the end of the mall and it is some superstore type place with all kinds of goodies and of coarse I stop and look at the electronics because I am a nerd. The police spot me but I vanish into the back of the store, the storage area and make with ninja stealth technics and make my way past several of them back into the store itself. I then get to the front through the super long dairy food isle that bottomed out on the liqour center. I walked past the counters and got outside. Then all hell breaks loose again.  I see from the one side a police vehicle screaming towards me with sirens blasting. So what do I do, run like a bullet. I mean in this dream I streaked across the parking lot (remember this is a super mall type place and it is in suburban hell). I make with the ninja crouching tiger hidden dragon skills and hop up onto the top of a mini-strip mall thing to avoid the cops. I make my way across the roof and get to a stand of trees. I then hop in them. Now the trees are wet like after a rain so I was getting soaked by their leaves. The first ones I jump into are pine trees I make my way through them and into a small stand of older hardwoods. From there I hop down and run across a neighborhood with the police chasing me all the way. I hop back onto a roof and then to another which is another store. I then hope from the store into a courtyard that has this large porn sign above it notifying me that I had jumped into something of a strip club parking lot only I got the backyard place of here. I jumped in the middle of several stripper types and said "excuse me ladies, if cops come looking say that I wasn't here.' They all nodded and said they wouldn't say I was there. I then lept out of there. Now in my dream I must have been even better looking that I am in real life because shit to get any woman to do something like that is nearly inpossible without a large diamond or lots of cash and I had neither in the dream.  Now the next dream in the series. I guess the wedding was called off because I went over to her house only it wasn't here real life house. It was this mansion type place that was gorgeous. I did a ninja stealth approach but I soon learned it wouldn't be nesecary because they were expecting me. Especially Beth. In this dream something was slightly different than in person. She had a boob job. Her boobs really weren't any bigger but they were fuller and just different than in real life I guess. (I haven't seen them unclothed in a long time so I don't know what they look like) Anyways I go to her room and I just crawl into bed with her. We just lay there and are close to each other.  At this point I woke up. I tried going back to sleep to get more and I did. However when I woke up it was the most peacefull fealing I have ever had. I was just so calm...I don't know how to explain it really.  I got back to sleep and the dream kinda continued. This time I went off to get something and came back and she was taking a mud bath. I played with her while she was muddy it was fun in the dream. Of coarse we had sex in my dreams what good dreams are there for a guy without sex attached. However it wasn't an illicit sex dream. I knew that we were going to have sex but it was like a movie where we got started then it would flash to the end when we were in post coital cuddle. Strange indeed. Again I was waking up with this sense of calm.  I don't know what it was all about and the only thing that I can come up with is that I am lonely. Lonely beyond all belief. However even if their was someone I don't think that I could open up to them.  The closest I got to opening up was with Beth, I have told her that and I don't know if she believes me on it. Just simply becuase we ended so weirdly I don't know what she thinks about that period. I know she was mad about it all becuase she wasn't in the loop of my mental illness at that time.   I am starting to ramble because I don't know what I need. I can't really invest the energy in getting a new girlfriend and I really don't know if thats what I want. By investing energy I mean that it was so much mentally from me the first time around that it exhausted me, nearly drove me nuts, and now my health is much worse. That is another point I am not healthy, really I don't know how much time I have and there is no one out there who wants to have anything to do with that.   There is no woman out there strong enough to deal with that. To deal with someone they care about or love knowing they will die soon. I don't think there is any female that can cope with that. I have seen guys do it, but women don't seem to be able to handle that. Besides I really wouldn't want to do that to a woman. Fall in love then leave.   This leaves me with a dilema. I am lonely and need that, but how do I get it? Plus someone already has my heart. I have told her before and she tells me to "stop that" or move on essentially, but I am not built that way unfortunately.   I don't really want sex per-se. I want intimacy.   Jeesh...I am all bound up now...talk amongst yourselves I'll give you a topic. What's wrong with me?

      Not much to report today...just another day of not much happening.  I got to go out briefly and pick up a money order and some pepsi and that was about it.  I had Tequito's for breakfast...they are the perfect food.  Finished watching A Beautiful Mind...that movie brings me to tears it is so well done and you feel for the character. There is most certainly a fine line between genious and insanity. I think John Nash struggles to stradle the line, but in the end he has done it well.  Now I am watchin Monty Python and The Holy Grail. Monty Python was and is ground breaking in comedy. Each one of the troupe had very specific talents and they were all able to showcase them together. If they ever ever tour again I will go to a show. Even if it is overseas or whatever. I will be there just because they are legends.  Tomorrow I will seriously look for a camera. As tomorrow my mom comes back with my credit card. I need that in order to place an order online. I think by tomorrow evening I will be able to get one.  Till tomorrow when something may happen...peace love hapiness and pie

      Hey out there in Cyber Land...another thrilling installment into my life.   Yeah right. My life is exciting as a shoe that happens to be on fire with a village of fleas living in it. Well hell not even that exciting. In that scenario you would have fleas jumping about saying in flea speak "help me help me, my baby is in there, stop touching me there chief flippet I already have a man!" Or something like that.   My world consists literally of this. I wake up round a bouts 4PM go downstairs and get some sort of food. I then veg for a bit in front of the TV in the kitchen while eating whatever I grabbed from the cupboard or freezer. Whenever my grandmother comes into the kitchen and starts rattling around (and she comes in there to simply make noise I am quite sure of that) I then gather my Pepsi and head out to the living room to continue watching TV. If something interests me enough to head upstairs and hop on the net I do so, otherwise I just veg in front of the TV watching either CNN, CNNHN, FSTV, Worldlink, Comedy Central, History Channel, or maybe another channel if something catches my eye, but those are my main flipping channels. I then veg until 11PM when I faithfully flip over to Comedy Central to watch Daily Show with John Stewart, because it is probably the best news source in the world. Ok maybe not but it is funny as hell. Then I watch Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn...that show makes me mad because all they do is yell at each other and call each other stupid when indeed they are stupid because they can't form sentences most of the time. Then at Midnight I switch to MTV for The New Tom Green Show. It has its ups and downs...overall it is pretty funny.   I veg maybe another hour downstairs before heading back to my room. I grab a few Pepsi's and make my way upstairs to my room. Sometimes I watch a movie and surf. Like tonight I am watching A Beautiful Mind (which rocks ass people). The way he saw things is a lot of what I see sometimes...it is weird. Anyways I surf for a bit, watch a little porn, head to my favorite sites which by the way are listed here (Highradiation (Cloud10), HardOCP, Howard Dean Campaign, and then to here to update and rant!). Then I head to here to update this pathetic blog with my absolutely boring life.   After a bit of staring off into space I head to bed. Sometimes early in the morning, sometimes late at night...depending on what you call which.  Well today I have decided that trying to get a Coolpix SQ for the price I want is useless, but I can get a Coolpix 3100 for the better price. Plus it is a little better camera I would guess and it fits into my sexy little camera catagory.  So I will try for that model.  Now off to some porn.

      I am really hating this bidding thing...simply because I am on a budget kinda...I mean I could get an uber camera and spend a bit more than what I am bidding at right now...but I would never hear the end of it because my mom and grandmother are cheap and wanna get the cheapest thing around...even though they wouldn't even have a clue as to what is worth the money and what isn't.  They would go to wal-mart and pick up the cheapest digital camera and then bring it home like a prize without realizing that first it is a piece of crap, and second they overpaid for it.   I need to be able to go to about 320 for what I am looking for...and I may have to do that. I will just have to hear the heat...but the cost will be readily made up in the ensuing auctions that I will be having.   They wanna get started tomorrow selling all this shit, but the stuff they want to sell is stuff that needs to be photographed first. It is just a big ass mess and I am bought at wits ends with them both. They want it done tomorrow and aren't willing to help with the legwork.  Well over the next few days between trying to get a camera and figuring out what I should start my auctions for some of this crap at it will be a busy few days. Plus I need to go out and get a money order and a few other things....like pepsi...I have a pepsi shortage, I am down to a dozen cans and it will be critical soon...hehehe  Its hard to believe that almost a month of this house arrest shit is already over...I wish it would go faster...and hey it may well go faster partly because I have auctions to hold, a virus in my lungs that isn't letting go and will land me in the hospital soon, and money to be made...as well as a lot of learning to do!  Piss on me...

      Well I am trying to get a digital camera on Ebay and it is just extremely frustrating...I may have to up what I will pay for one.  I am still trying to get a Nikon CoolPix SQ...small sleek and sexy. Something that I need in my life, cause I am have none of that :-)  I am in this strange place that rarely is tread by any person. To tread here is dangerous for the soul. To be in this place is toxic for life and all its joys. This is the place that I call home. The place that comforts me. It is the place where I know what is coming next is not anything unexpected. To live here would kill others, but for me I thrive. If you think my life is easy, walk a while in my place. If you think that I like living this life then you may be wrong. I don't like my life, but I accept what it is and have decided to thrive within the parameters set forth by whomever or whatever. To thrive is to live, to live is to die, to die is to enter unto peace.

      Well there are two sites that I love to peruse every now and again...one is the infamous Tucker Max and the other is TardBlog (also from the creator of Tucker Max)...there really is a guy named Tucker Max and his web site is hilarious...he has the most insane stories out there...he is one of my hero's. The Tardblog is a recalling of a special ed teachers daily life. Yes she teaches tards.  Well Tucker Max has been involved in a nasty court battle that has actually kinda caught the establishment by its balls. He has stories posted on their of his many conquests and one of them happened to be someone semi-famous Katy Johnson Miss Vermont 2001 + 1999. They have both been featured on MTV...Tucker on Sex2K and Katy on Made "I wanna be a beauty queen".   Tuckers story of Katy was pretty harsh but from what I have read and what I believe it is true...she sounds like one hell of a character herself that is in need of a little therapy. Who knows...maybe she does.   Anyway she sued to have the stories of her pulled from the site as well as any mention of her name as well as any mention of her title as Miss Vermont. Well this simply flies in the face of a little thing called the First Amendment. You know the one about free speech. If you never have heard of it the amendment basically says you can say anything that you want anytime that it is your right. Now there have been limitations on it like yelling fire in a crowded theatre and such, but never has anyones right to tell a story been pulled. Until this case was brought. Basically a judge in Florida (yeah that state with all the old people who aparently can't figure out how to vote, a bunch of Cubans, and a dearth of pretty much mindless beings) told Tucker to pull the story down and ruled that he couldn't tell that story...against the First Amendment.  Well to kinda cut it down the order has been struck down, Katy lost her motion, Tucker got his groove back, and well we all get to laugh at the pitiful attempt at yet another poor hapless soul who needs to get a friggin life....  Oh and one other thing you can't say is this "I want to Kill The President of The United States of America". That gets the Secret Services cockles up...that don't like that...even though it really is protected speech.   I will probably be hauled off in a few days for saying that...but I would still have one hell of a lawsuit...its free speech baby...I have never made plans nor would I to kill the current president...even though he is a lying sack of cow shit that has sent many to war to die all in the name of power and money...I hope he enjoys killing people...because he really is a sack of shit.   Anyone who has graduated with a master's degree should have even the most basic command of the english language...but our president doesn't...hell a Japanese teenager that goes to "engrish" class probably has a better grasp of it than that horses ass!  Can I say how much I dislike George Bush...I hope is defeated in this election, then I hope he goes home to Texas and is run over by some of his cows....and then whoever is in office at the time will award those cows a medal.   George W. Bush is no better than any other dictator in history and should be brought up on war crimes trials as well as he should be impeached!

      Well I got into a semi fight with my mom and grandma today...  Here was the scenario...we were all sitting in the living room with our neighbor...now my neighbor has a retarded daughter that is in her thirties...and we were talking about my dog and I said "yeah he really is a retard"...it never once stuck in my head about my neighbors kid...and really it wasn't meant to offend...and I think that the neighbor didn't take offence (and if she did...if she can't take a joke, then fuck her). This comment was not meant with any malice because my dog is indeed a retard and dumb...does dumb shit all the time...  well she left to go over to her house to show her husband a signed football that we have and no sooner does she get out the door than I am hit with from either my mom or grandmother (it happened so fast it was a blur) I was hit with something along the lines of "you have to watch what you say around her because she doesn't like the word retard".  Now instead of leaving it there my grandmother continued on about it for another minute or so. Now it would have been fine leaving it at the initial comment as I fealt bad about it,  instead they continued on...  I got mad and said that I didn't mean any harm and they should let it drop...the next door neighbor is a big girl and can handle a battle if she so chooses...again I felt bad about it but now I was mad because they kept on.  My mom called me insensitive...which I am about certain things...like handicaps and such...hell if someone wants to call me a handicapped broken gimp I wouldn't take offence...I would just fire it right back at them.  It just kept on happening and happening and my grandmother was getting more rude about it...finally I snapped and told her to be quiet about it...it was over and the point was moot...that made my mom even more pissed...I just wanted to drop it.  It finally got down to my mom and I after my grandmother stormed off...and I told my mom had they both let it drop after the initial blasting it would have been fine but instead my grandmother chose to take it to the next level...now she does this all the time...it is like a little dog nipping at your heels...sooner or later your gonna kick the dog...and tonight apparently I kicked the dog.  I love both my grandmother and mom a lot...they have done more for me that I could have ever hoped for and have been great about all my flaws...but I just can't stand being attacked like that for something so insignificant as that.  That is my hell...it is knitpicking and heel biting...and it gets old.  I am dark and moody but I don't let it spill onto others as much as possible....when I get like that I stay out of the way so as to not pick fights like this. Because I avoid people and can generally be a crabass I am the bad guy in it all.  Well tonight I put in a bid on a Coolpix SQ...hopefully I will get this one cause I need a new camera for all of this...and I think that would be a good camera for that and for just toting around as it is teeny tiny...plus it looks K-Rad...well hopefully I will win the auction cause that would be hella sweet...if I don't get the auction there are a couple of packages that are reasonable for around 500 bucks...and that would be kewl as hell any way you look at it...the packages are worth it seeing the camera sells for about 400 in the stores...and with the extras it would push the price over the 500 mark...and the package includes a larger memory card, extra batery pack, and some other goodies...  Well wish me luck on the auctions...I will need it as I have a lot of crap to sell...like this one football that is signed by a bunch of hall of famers (namath and many others) that would bring around a grand or more depending...plus I have a Kobe Bryant jersey that is signed by him...so that might make a few bucks...lots of rookie cards (shaq and more)...this whole thing will bring in the big bucks...maybe will allow for a lot of goodies plus a lot of cash to invest.  I will get into really selling the shit out of this stuff as soon as I can get a working camera.  Peace out...   Check out the Howard Dean site!

      My mom  got here today and we unloaded the truck...jesus there was a lot of collectables...I would say way more that a hundred grand worth if all were sold for retail...hell maybe even more...  We have 50 or so Basketballs that have been signed by all the teammates on that team...I dunno what all teams but there are a shit load of basketballs...tons of cards, many starting lineup figures, lots of other collectables...I mean just tons of shit...  plus she brought up several boxes of CDs and DVDs...so I will go through those tomorrow...and tomorrow I am going to look for a camera on Ebay...I will definitely need one....and should be able to recoup that cost with the sales of even the first two items...  Well I need to sack out as my med are definitely working now and I am tired...so lets see if I am able to get an uninterupted nights sleep shall we....  Peace out yo!

      I finally did get back to the person that wrote me yesterday...I wrote a long ole' email.   I also got my picture hosting problem fixed for the time being. Lets see how long it lasts...  Not much to really tell today. I finally took a bunch of pictures of the jerseys we have. I have a Kobe Bryant signed, Shaq signed, Gretsky signed...and more...tomorrow I have to figure out how to take good pics of the bats...  I am having to resort to interesting ways of photographing all this stuff. Tomorrow will be more interesting as I have more unusual shapes to try and accurately capture with a camera.   Tomorrow I should have some of these auctions up and I will most likely pimp some links from here...because after all I am a consumer whore...  Which reminds me I need to see how much bandwidth per month I have on my host because I have a funny video that people should see. It isn't bad or gross...it really is damn funny. It is called "Rejected" and is a cartoon. Do a google search for the video and see if you can come up with it...really it is funny and if you can find it watch it, definitely worth the time to download.   I will check on my monthly transfer and see if I can host it...or if I even have enough webspace to do so... :-)  Till tomorrow when I may have some links for ya...PEACE!  And BTW if you link to me would you be so kind as to let me know...I will be more than willing to give you a link :-)

      Hello there folks out there in cyber land.  My picture place has for some reason stopped allowing me to link to it. I am working on that now. I was hoping this would all be easy but of coarse it can never be that way.  I recieved a letter from someone this morning that read my blog. Thank you for the kind words :-) I will be writing you later today.  As I have said before anyone who writes me will always get a reply. As I am not a stuck up dude.   Peace

      Ok so I got all of Office Beta 2003 installed and it is da bomb baby. When I upgraded from Office 2000 to Office XP the changes were small and not really noticable. However this new version really is worthy of the Upgrade status for those who are back at Office 97 or 2000. This will be the new Office suite to get a hold of.   Outlook 2003 is really slick and powerful and has some great Junk Mail filtering built in already even in this Beta 2 build. It catches a lot of it from Hotmail and that is great. That is something also that they have fixed in this version. Office XP didn't play well with multiple Hotmail accounts, Oulook Express was much better in that sense. Now this Beta fixed many of the bugs and is very powerful.   Today I got my camera. The Nikon Coolpix 3100. It is also a great little camera. I think I will have a lot of fun with it.   Right now I am watching the Al Gore speech that he gave earlier today from  MoveOne.org . So far it is a great speech. Here is a direct link to it.   urlLink The Speech  You will need Realplayer and probably broadband to view it. While Gore is somewhat of a bore...the speech is still good and brings out the idea that we have been mislead by someone who has nothing to gain as he isn't going to run for office...at least now.  Watch it and let me know what you think.  Peace (ps there may be another update in a bit once I finish with the speech)

      I also just finished installing MS Office 2003 Beta and I am currently downloading the updates...that may take a while.  From what I see so far the biggest change is in Outlook 2003. The changes look pretty nifty and it will be interesting to see how it stacks up against what I think is one of the best email programs out there...good ole Outlook Express.  So we will see tomorrow when I will be using it more vigorously.

      What is funny about it is that I am watching what it being typed and done remotely from both my screen on my main computer and then on the laptop!  This will be a boon for my little business...as I have people asking questions all the time and now I can remotely log onto their computer and show them without having to make a service call to the site...  I have a guy that I will be going to his house this next week and I will install this so in the future if he has minor problems I can remotely look at them and possibly fix them! Woohaaa!

      I got an email from one of my friends down south that reads the blog...big shout out to Missy! Thanx for reading it...hope it doesn't bore you to much, and I hope that I can make someone laugh from time to time while looking into my life.  Here is a little info for you Missy...and I will email you back tomorrow as I have to be up to recieve my camera that I ordered from  Newegg .  So here is the little update in a convoluted sort of way. I haven't been laid in over a year and half and my balls are starting to turn a nice shade of blue...maybe it is because of no sex or my lungs not currently delivering the needed oxygen to them.  I am still sort of looking for work although with my health being on a roller coaster from hell it is hard to secure regular employement when you don't know how things will be week to week, but do not worry I do happen to have on of the best doctors for CF in the Nation and he is really dedicated although he is an ass sometimes.  Mom was down there not but a couple weeks ago to clear out the trailer and storage box of all that shit Doug got over the years as he is now in jail...and will remain in jail for some time. He was busted about a month ago for guess what....more credit card fraud. He bought tickets to the Memphis Invitational with a stolen card and then they busted him for it, he also bought a butt load of movie tickets as well. They also got him for having weapons in his car, as he is a convicted felon he is not supposed to have any weapons. The weapons where this knife he got me and a pellet pistol he got me...ironic huh?  So she went down and got all the collectables and it is now up to me to sell them all on Ebay...hence the need for a digital camera that should be here tomorrow.  On the health front I have been in and out of the hospital over the past six months or so several times and I fear I will be headed there again because of a nasty lung infection that I can't get rid of...it is becoming a chore to breath because of it, however I have been putting it off for some time because I am now allergic to Pennicillian based drugs and the rest that they can treat me with my bugs don't respond well to them...so the next time I go in I will have to be desensitized to Penn. drugs which will entail days of hives and uncomfort...that sucks ass! The weird thing is I am taking decent care of my self and have cut out many things in my life to lengthen the life of my lungs...I still slip from time to time...but hey I am doing better than ever on that front.  I am finally finished with all my legal battles and just serving out my sentence in my little room here in PA. I was busted several years ago as the driver for what turned out to be a large computer hardware theft ring. I really was just the driver in it all...you can Google my name and see what all they said. In the end I came out alright because I was straight with the prosecution on it and gave them the information that really made the case for them as it turns out (because I am anal retentave and kept logs of what was said on ICQ). Right now I am serving a six month house arrest and I am down to five months now or a little less...I will be off of that by just after Christmas...then I have four years probation...plus I have a whopper of restitution (96 grand in conjunction with the other people also convicted). Funny thing is I didn't get anything out of it...everything that I got was (which wasn't much) was taken away (of coarse!) and the rest was smokin pot...but no where near what would be worth all this crap. So that is that story.  Michelle came up during July to do an externship...she has about a year to go. Also she is still engaged to Arkansas boy...he is a real treat I tell ya. However she is well, although they are making her pull a lot of night duty and you know how she likes to be in bed by 11...so that is pissing her off. She is also worried about the debt she has amassed during school...my philosophy on that is they can't get blood from a stone...so they can suck it. She will make herself clear of that problem soon enough.  Mom is ok...but when she went down she found a bunch of letters from women that Doug had been "carrying on" with over the internet and through the mail. She also found a bottle of that herbal stay hard stuff...so he was tryin to get some action even while dissin' my mom. That made her pretty depressed but then it made her mad.  As for Doug he will have to serve out at least his remaining probation sentence down at Parchment...which is three years, plus the prosecutor is going for ten years on the other charges...there are so many of them. They went all Macgyver on him and had him under watch for months...so they have plenty to get him with. YAY!!!!  My blog here is just to keep people up to date because I really don't have many real life in the flesh friends right now...I still have people I talk to but I can't see them now because of this mess. However that will end and I will definitely get out to see people more often after I am done with it.  Hmmm what else...oh yeah I am going nuts being here at my grandmothers...I daily have to remind myself not to stab myself or her with a fork...fun times!  Once I get done with house arrest I will most likely do a little travelling with some of the proceeds out of the selling I do on this collectables...no shit there is like 100 grand worth or more just laying around here...it is a big task but I will get it all sold just to make my mom and I moola!  Well I will talk to ya'll later...and I will email you missy tomorrow...  Peace and thanks for reading!

      Corrections to a past post...Bush will raise in excess of a quater of a billion dollars...that is a shitload of money, and we saw last time that he was able to buy the presidency with nearly that same amount.  Also I would like for some people to consider this. What if Dean gets the nomination nod from the Dems. Which I think he will. Who would be a great VP running mate?  After about two minutes of thought I came to this simple conclusion. I think that if he wins the primary he should give good ole Sen. McCain a call and have him sign up. Now for it to work he would have to keep his party affiliation.   Think about it...Dean if he won the primary would get most of the Democratic vote in the election. If he has McCain he could then garner the support of us Republicans that are disgusted with out party and current Administration but wouldn't normally vote for a Democrat (even though I will regardless of the running mate he chooses). Also McCain could bring in the support from the Independants that he held many of until he lost the primary in 2000. He could better bring in those Nader supporters and independants easier than just a fully Democratic ticket.  It may well be "the perfect political storm" for Bush and Cheney. As far as I know there isn't a law that says you can't pick a running mate from another party. The only thing would be is that both parties would be upset because of the choice....but it may be what the people want. Two fiscal conservatives both running on the platform that they will do what is in the best interest of the people, not what may be in the best interest of Washington and the Lobbyists.  Now that is a ticket that many could get behind and support I think. What do you think? Gimme a  urlLink Shout out!

      PS I am getting used to putting links into the text on the page and will continue to do so from now on...HTML is becoming less of a mystery to me now because of Blogspot.  Also I want to let people know that last night I saw  Dean  on Larry King live...I must say his smile is a little creepy...but I can grow to like it.  The only critisizms that I have about the interview are this.  First. Dean needs to recognize that not all his supporters are Democrats and that other factions may well be the ones that help in getting elected. Instead of classifying people as Dems and Repubs he needs to just say "the people" as he is the people's candidate that just happens to be a Democrat.  Second: He tiptoed way far around the "gay marriage" issue. I wish that he would have been more forcefull on it. Marraige liscences are issued by the government and are not a religious thing at all in my book. It is a piece of documentation that comes from the government that is the same as Civil Union documents. Marriage has to long been associated with religion and in our society it is a legal contract, not a religous one. Again the Church and State should be seperate. However in codifying a law to allow "gay marriage" it needs to made clear that Religious institutions do not have to accept them but the law should. I am for a homosexuals right to marriage...we let far worse people enter into the legal contracts so I think it only fair that anyone who is willing (or stupid enough) to enter into marriage should be allowed.  Also I read the Time writeup on Dean. It shed some light on his past and his upbringing. Something that people really need to know is that he really isn't as far left as most people make him out to be...in reality he is more centrist in the Democratic party and more like a classic Democrat than what is parading around Washington posing as Democrats. The Dems in DC are more like Republicans of old, and the Republicans of the now are more like Nazi's or Stalinist's then their humble beginnings as they are so far right it would take a few more right turns and then be in 1930's era Germany in many ways.  Another thing to consider when you cast your vote. Republicans claim fiscal responsibility, but no Republican president in the last 30 years has managed to even come remotely to a balanced budget. Instead they like to run huge deficits that only favor the wealthy in the end and will bankrupt the government if left unchecked over the next few years.  To balance the budget there will be some things that have to be done and they won't be pretty or even popular, like tax increases to levels that were in place before Bush took office. With his tax cuts have we seen new growth? With his tax cuts have you seen your salary increase? Most likely you have lost your job or seen a pay cut (to be fair however not all of that can be blamed on Bushenomics), but instead of keeping taxes at a point where the government could pay down its huge debt they added to it with unesecary cuts that overwhelmingly favor the wealthy.  The only thing that anyone can ask another to do is vote their heart...but before voting with your heart become familiar with what each and every official running for office stands for.  On a side note it was much publisized that Colin Powell will not be back if Bush is re-elected. I am glad to hear that...not because I want him gone but because he is to good of a man to be working in this administration. I would bet a buck that he writes a book after he is out telling of the abuses and plain out manipulation of the Administration during his time as Secretary of State. He is not a Bush goon at all, but unfortunately he has to go with what the administration wants or risks being labled a traitor to his nation. Had Powell been given lattitude on the Iraq bungle he would have most likely upped sanctions and let the country implode without a single American soldier dieing in that hell hole.

      I have been frenetically checking to see what the status is on the camera that I purchased the other day is...well folks it has made it to Pittsburgh and may well be here later today...YAY  For those of you that don't know I got myself a Nikon CoolPix 3100 and a 128mb Compact Flash card to go along with it for mad picture taking...now the camera does have an official purpose and use...for taking pictures of goods to be sold on  Ebay . So it will be of great use. I am hoping that I will have some auctions up later this week...I have lots of stuff to sell and it will be great to get rid of some of it all...plus it will pay for the camera!  Yay...just the thought of something coming in for me! woohooo!  One of my former computer students sent me this  book  yesterday and I plan to read it while I am in the hospital next...which I have a feeling will be this month as I am getting pretty damned sick...  O Well...such is life.

      Last night I had this bomb diggity of a dream.  It had to do with campaigning or my idea of campaigning. Grass roots of sorts using new ideas of marketing. What needs to happen for someone to beat Bush is to get to the root of the problem. There is not a great deal of grass roots campaigning going on. With the exception of one campaign and that is the  Dean  camp.   We need to see a return to that to get the people that have been alienated by the whole process back into the process. After all this is our America. Regardless of what you think we all can actually make a difference. It is true that lots of money can buy the presidency as we have seen it in the last election and may well see it again (think about it Bush will spend a quarter of a million on his campaign against whomever runs against him).  How can anyone dream of beating that kind of money. Well we can start by using technology. We can use it to make politicians accountable to us. We can demand to be heard at the debates through Instant Messaging technology. We can communicate with them and have them answer questions important to us and debate the issues that matter to us. We can demand through that a higher standard of politician. If people fire off questions and topics at them in real time then they have to be able to answer us, if they can't then we obviously we know that they aren't capable of thinking on the fly or are groomed by higher powers.   How can we accomplish getting into these debates. By getting behind someone who will do it for us. Maybe  Dean  will help us in this. Insist debates that include real people not just a selected few, and not just reporters.  I don't know whether or not we can do it...but it is worth a try.

      I finally had a question answered today by someone I care about. Of course the quetsion was a loaded one. Really how was it going to be answered. I won't tell you all what I asked because I still have a little dignity. Needless to say the answer was no and not again.  I feel a little weird about it because I don't even know what I wanted the answer to be.   I think it is time to move on in my life, and I will because it is about time. Moving on is hard to do. Maybe when I get done with all this crap that I am going through I may just go out and try to go buck wild if my health allows me to.  I may just become the next Tucker Max...only of Pittsburgh. I would need do a lot to do that...but I think I may be able to do it. After all what do I have to live long for...certainly not love.  Which brings me to this idea...Love is a farse, something created by man. An emotion that is flawed in every sense of the word. To unconditionally love someone is impossible because we are all capable of stopping that love is certain conditions are met.  So for me I will no longer love as I cannot achieve that emotion. Instead I will lust.

      Today I went and got a camera off of  NewEgg . I got a Nikon Coolpix 3100 and a 128MB Compact flash card for 332.99. Not a bad deal considering just the camera alone retails for 349.00.  Also tonight I went surfing around to read a little more about my man  Howard Dean . The Democratic establishment doesn't seem to like this guy because he is not really a true blue Dem.   Now lemme try and set something strait about him in my own words. The reason he is not a true blue Dem. and the reason that I will be voting for him when it is time to vote for President if he is nominated is because he isn't a true blue Dem. He has many policies and ideas that don't jive with the rank and file.  First he is much more liberal (or conservative) than most Dems. He believes in gun owners rights. It doesn't seem like he wants to take any more of those rights away which goes against the Dogma of the Dems. He also is a supporter of Gay Rights openly. While the Dems support Gay Rights in their meetings and thoughts they don't really stand up for them when the time comes.  It was also critisized that he really doesn't have a true plan to fix things that he sees wrong. My question is this. Should he this early in the game? I mean things change as times move on. A true representative of the people has to be flexable when it comes to things like this in my view and not set on his own agenda for things like it is the bible of their lives.  Sure he may not have a budget plan right now, but how many Dems do have a budget plan that is detailed right now? I bet none of them. The budget is something that can be worked on and proposed whenever he gets into debates with the Republican candidate which will be George Bush.   His ideas are sound. Greater spending on health care, education, and security. Now all of these things can be achieved with a balanced budget. If a guy like Clinton (who really was bright in his own right but not a genious) can do it than someone who is a Doctor certainly can.   What we have right now is a crisis here in America. The health care system is crumbling. It really is in shambles. Partly due to unlimited lawsuits towards doctors. Now I am not for limiting these lawsuits, I really don't want to see caps put on because there are times when a Doctor really screws up and messes someone up due to negligence, those lawsuits are justified. However a vast majority of them aren't and those are the lawsuits that need to be capped. Maybe a good system would be to put in place a national board that is comprised of both lawyers and doctors who collect facts about a particular case. They then make a ruling as to whether or not the suit has merrit or should be capped. While this would certainly cost a lot of money to do simply because of the shear volume of lawsuits it would be a more efficient way of clearing out the courts of these frivilous lawsuits and then letting the ones that have merrit go onto a jury trial to get "justice".   Another thing that is clear is that the Education system is in collapse. The "No Child Left Behind" initiative has effectively dumbed down the students of many districts so that districts can stay off of a list of places that need improvement. In doing this they lower the effective testing measures to allow for students that aren't proficiant to pass therefor helping the disrtict out. That is simply wrong. Education needs to be overhauled from top to bottom.   My education plan is fairly simple in concept. First we need to get rid of Teachers unions as we know them. They have a lot of resposibility in helping create this crisis by keeping teachers that aren't up to teaching in a job because they are in a union. Second we need to make it so that starting salaries of teachers are 100% greater than what they are now. There is absolutely no reason that teachers are living below the poverty level in many places. These people are teaching our future. If they aren't able to make ends meet then something needs to be done to alleviate that. One way would be through pay. Third schools need to be thoroughly modernized. There should be a computer for every child. Not because they need toys but because we could cut costs by handing out E-Books instead of real books. The technology is there in TabletPCs now. They would have a tabletpc that would allow them to scribble notes on the book pages, take notes digitally, and in the end test with certainty of lower cheating. It would also give children the basics on computer operation that everyone needs. Fourth the whole book issue needs to be laid to rest. Standardize the texts. Using ebooks we could do this easily. If errors are found in the books then you could release point updates to the students via wireless connections in the classes as they become available, plus it would cut down on publishing costs tremendously in the long run. Fifth schools need to be broken up into specialty schools in many more cases. Test the students and find out what their accuments are. If they are strong in science and math fast track them with more difficult studies in those areas, send them to schools that teach that. If a student is strong in Literary arts and Liberal arts (like art and music) weed them out and send them to special schools to cultivate that talent. We need to start playing off of the talents of our young people and start to realize that we can't possibly teach everything to everyone and instead focus on producing better students through specialization. Sixth and finally we need to revamp the entire State College System. Everyone goes through a state test that ranks them by states. Ultimately they can be ranked nationally. If a student has a high enough score to enter a State School then the tuition is automatically provided in total with the expectation that they keep a certain GPA. If you want to go to a private school then the government will pony up the number that it would cost for tuition normally and the student and parents can make up the difference. A note to this though, state school would have to provide education for anyone who wants in. If you are below the minimum ranking then you pay on a sliding scale as to how much the tuition would be. So say if you were one slot down from being accepted (one point) then you would pick up a percentage based on how close your score is to the minimum for full tuition coverage. This would allow anyone who wants to go to school go, but would make the less well adapted pay for some of it. There would be acceptions to the rule for handicapped students that may have disabilities that prevent them from making normal scores. These things need to be done to fix the system. This will cost a lot of money for sure. However seeing that we spend so much on the Military budget I am sure we can find some ways to reduce it or simply cover the extra cost on a federal level. Education is the key to higher paying jobs, higher paying jobs create higher tax bases from which to tax.  The military needs to be fixed. We must have a strong military, but that doesn't mean that it should cost as much as it does currently for the level of protection they give us. We could spend more on technology now and in the future the military would be more of a scalpel than a sword and precision strikes would be far more effective than a huge military force. The threats have changed. No longer do we have any vast armies to go against (with the exception of North Korea, China, and Israel). Fighting a large scale battle of old is a waste anymore because we can do more with less and be more precise through technology.   Another thing that is desperately needed is some great public works projects. There are several that come to mind here.  First we have a drought in most of the country. However we are surrounded by seas. The government could conceivably build huge desalinization plants and pipe water wherever it is needed through existing infrastructure (the oil and gas line currently in use...I'll get to those in a minute). With these huge plants not only would we need huge projects to construct them (thus creating short term labor jobs as well as engineering jobs) but they would just simply be good for the country. No longer would we have droughts that threaten our existance.  Second there is a plan to build a massive world highway with a bridge across the Bering Straite. Now this project alone would cost about 100 Billion dollars to do. Considering that we have spent about 85 billion for a war and will continue spending billions in Iraq we can afford this project over several years. This project would literaly create so many jobs that we would not be able to fill all of them from existing labor pools. The needs for this project would encompass almost every industry. If you madated that at minimum 50% of the material be bought from american companies you would see an overnight turnaround in the steel industry and construction industry. We can't spend it all here because we can't meet the demand for material internally. Plus this would be a boon to the world economy which we depend on to be strong so we can flourish. This project would be huge and really what better way could the goverment help out the economy other than start a huge public works project like this.  Third the government needs to spend massively on alternative energy sources like nuclear, hydrogen, solar, wind, and geo-thermal. For the hydrogen market to actually come into existance would require a mandate from the government and massive investment from them as well. The estimated costs to overhaul the infrastructure to create enough hydrogen have been projected in the 10's of billions, but no private company will go out on a limb and spend that kind of moola on something that hasn't even been standardized. If we could move to hydrogen for vehicles and small power facilities we could elliminate the need for the massive oil pipelines that are currently used for moving gas around the coutry freeing them up for one of the precursers to hydrogen fuel, water distribution from the massive desalinization plants. By the time the plants would come online and ready to flow water we could have most of the parts in place for hydrogen powered vehicles. That would also need to be done, massive breaks and subsidies on hydrogen vehicles for the first four years so that people could afford to move to them. Have kind of like the Beetle of the hydrogen cars to get people started. Nuclear needs to have the stigma taken away from it. It is safe, clean, and affordable if done in the French or British model for nuclear.  Fourth we need a massive restructuring of the mass transit systems. This would help with hydrogen powered vehicles because you can mandate that they be hydrogen powered. This would jump start that whole deal. We need a national light rail system for passengers that works, bullet trains, Maglev systems, whatever to get things in order.   These are a few of my ideas...lemme know what you think. I will continue this tomorrow evening with my ideas because I have a lot of them.

      Today was another long day of nothing. My mom is over and she got some shelves for some of the cards that I have to get rid of. Jesus there is a lot of crap there to go through.   I shit you not there may well be over 100,000 dollars worth of just cards! We even have a Britney Speares card with a bit of cloth on it that was from one of her concerts or something. We have several things from Kobe Bryant...those may sell well. There is just so much to go through.  Tomorrow we should know about a camera hopefully. May be able to finally get something cemented in...cause really I got to get at it with selling this stuff.  Well I am going to get a bit of sleep...well more like tons of sleep. Even with as much sleep as I get I am still tired all the time. Plus I am in the middle of a screaming migraine!  Peace

Well not much to report today. I kinda feel crappy...  Oh I found Devon's site finally...I had been a loyal follower of her blog...she was one of the first people's blogs I got addicted to. Now I found her new address and I will link her up in a bit.  I also have to put a link over there for Brian's film...he wrote, directed, and produced his own film project. It looks to be pretty good and I am looking forward to it being finished and shown. By then I may be actually able to go to the premier! Wooohoooo!  Well let me get those links for ya'll.  Have a good night. Since I lost my HD the other day I lost all my scans and pics of collectables and now have to redo all that work as well as listings that I hadn't posted....jeesh...

      To make a clarification to some people out there who think I am a bleeding heart liberal...I have this to say. I am a registered Republican...yes folks I am. I just don't think that the Republican party has moved in the correct way. I believe that is has moved so far right to accomodate a small fraction of people and then the rest of Republican (or many of them at least) have followed blindly into the valley without questioning what is right.   Democrats are no better in many senses...they have many of the same problems and have moved away from their ideas.   Here is a simple list of things to clarify my ideals. Gun Control:  I believe in smart gun control. Yes we should have checks, but no we don't need databases. We need to enforce the laws that are already in place. I believe that any non-violent American should be able to own a weapon. Even Felons...as long as they haven't been violent.  Abortion: I believe that it is up to the woman to do what she wants. I am not a woman and I would never want to impose my morals or views on one (they are already pissed enough). It doesn't mean that I think that abortion is right or wrong, it means that no law should be put into place that usurps the womans right to choose.  Military: I believe we need a strong military, but a smarter one at that. It should not cost us this much per year for a military and not be able to send them into war without costing more. Their budget is over 400 billion...yet they need more to go to war. Why?  Education: It should be free and effective. Anyone that displays the talent and the willingness to be a good student should have their way paid for them all the way through college. Schools should be more efficiant...but I think they need a lot more money from the government. The education system gets somewhere around 40 billion from the government (including colleges)...that certainly isn't enough.  Health Care: Universal all the way baby. No American should have to worry about a hospital bill. Healthy citizens cost less than unhealthy ones. The way to promote health is to take the dollar factor out of it. If it doesn't cost anyone anything then people will go to the doctors and take their meds. Everything should be covered including Plastic Surgery for those who need it (like burn victims and such). Now even Doctors are believing it would be the more economical way to go...7000 of them have banded together to promote the idea here in the States. We are the only first world nation that doesn't have Universal Coverage.  Environment: A strong healthy environment leads to a strong healthy economy. Our economy needs the environment. Without it no one lives and business dies. Strengthen the EPA and other agencies giving them enough teeth to even shut down companies that are killing the planet. Energy conservation and alternative energy resources need to become center stage in the environmental issue. We should be the leader in the world not the laughing stock.  Any others that I forgot. Email me from the bar on the right there and ask...I will answer.

      Ok so New York, part of Ohio, Detroit, parts of Canada all are having a power outage.  In New York City we have yet again seen the best of humanity and Americans...and I don't say that litely. We are seeing it because people are banding together and acting calmy and rationaly. However I don't think that calm will make its way to Washington. I think that Washington and the Bush Administration will have a knee jerk reaction and end up causing more problems then it even comes close to solving.  Tonight on Larry King Live California Governer Gray Davis, Hilary Clinton, and some other people plus one Bush energy special interest lacky were on. Davis and Clinton both made great points. That the Bush administration has consistantly thrown up roadblocks to progress on the road to making our utilities better. One of the things that the administration would like to see is national deregulation of the Electric Grid. We saw that in California when this act happens that energy companies and traders come in and make shortages to boost profits and generally make things worse for consumers. California is looking into a lawsuit agains Enron because it seems that it created an artificial shortage so it could boost prices and make money.  Now both Clinton and Davis said that the key is a truely balanced energy plan that doesn't nesecarily include tapping new resource but instead focuses on conservation and alternative energy sources like wind, solar, and other types of energy. Of coarse the administration doesn't want that because it would mean that their friends in Big Oil and Big Coal and Big Gas would all see their types of energy start to fall by the wayside causing the prices to drop.  The Bush lackey was saying that what is needed is more energy plants (which he is half correct) and that energy companies need to be able to tap additional resources and that deregulation would help out. Well most Americans know that big business is not in the business of making life better or cheaper for Americans...instead most big business is in the business of making money. The Bush White House is hand in hand with them all.  This is why we need them out. Electing someone outside of the Energy Loop would be a relief. We may see from that person a renewed interest and government money for energy sources like Hydrogen.   On another note did anyone see 60 Minutes 2 the other night? They had a piece on GM and their efforts in Hydrogen Powered vehicles. Some environmentalists critisize them saying that GM is just doing a little dog and pony show to placate us all. I think that if GM wanted to Placate us all they could do it for a lot less money as they have spent billions in research on Hydrogen power. No company spends that much (especially GM) without a plan to make it back from the research. The reason they are spending the money on it all is because when they get all the pieces together they stand to make Trillions off the technology...as do other companies.  Also here is an interesting story of sorts...our military may cause another Nuclear Arms race with some new fangled Gamma Bombs. Read the story  here.   We are in a scary time. I just hope that calmer heads will prevail and we will make it out alive.

      Its early and I haven't been to bed yet...but now I can go to bed finally...everything is in order.  I am just glad that nothing is really dead on my computer. I was dreading a dead hard drive but fortunately it isn't. Over the next few days it will eventually get back to the original configuration with all the software loaded...  Did I mention that Office 2003 Beta 2 rocks? Yes it does. It is the best version yet. Smaller than before yet more functional. Also Outlook 2003 is just da bomb when it comes to email clients. I am still in awe over it...talk about shock and awe...MS may have it with this package. I plan on getting the full version when it comes out soon as it would be worth the money for what it does and the abilities they have added. The entire Pro package fits on One (1!) CD right now...that is a feat I tell you. OfficeXP had many more disks for all the goodies...and Office 2000 had four discs that you had to load to get all the goodies. While I know that 2003 will probably have 3 or 4 discs when finalized with all the goodies...all of the core components will still fit on one disc which the others could only attempt to do...  Anyways that's nuff' bout' Office 2003...  Now off to bed...finally!

      Hey there cyber land...hope all of you are making it with this nasty ass worm going round.  Well I have made it so far. I am behind a firewall and I have patched my systems long ago. So all in all I am pretty safe from that...however I am not safe from simple old hardware problems!  The main drive on my system decided that it wanted to drop the boot sector as well as the NTFS tables leaving my hard drive as a big lump of nothing just hanging out in my syste...in other words my computer took a big ole shit.  Fortunately I am well prepared for things like this and I am not phased when this kind of stuff happens. I have all my disks just layin around and I am in the process of repairing it now...but I will kinda be down on my main box for the time being.   What makes me maddest of all is that I had a lot of stuff saved on that hard drive and not all of it was backed up. Fortunately not much was really lost overall...just really my emails that I had recieved and my documtents...as well as my favorites...outside of that I didn't loose much and whatever is gone I can live without really.   Oh well...such is life.  Yesterday was bad, today was worse, and tomorrow it will get even more evil.  Peace

      I'm sorry that I haven't responded to emails recently sent to me. I have been pretty busy and my brain is mulling over many things right now...I promise I will respond.  Yes folks I have a full blown lung infection with all the trappings...however I don't have a Doctors appointment for another two weeks...originally I thought I had one this week but apparently I didn't have one this month at all...sometimes I am retarded about appointments...I can never remember them and apparantly my PDA doesn't remember them either...hmmm my PDA...I thought it was supposed to help me be organized.  I got out a bit today. I had a lesson with a student. He had really good questions and they have caused my brain to actually have to process information. I mean these are questions I have never been asked before so I have to actually learn how to answer them...oh joy I get to learn something new.   I posted a couple of things on Ebay...and I have bunches more to put up...I may get some more pics taken tomorrow and get some more stuff up.  Lately I have been doing a lot of online reading...like the post below about the current state of the economy, taxes, and the federal reserve system. It would seem that the whole system is a fraud as it is supposed to be owned by the people of the US...however the federal reserve is actually a corporation that is not owned by the government...it is a federation of banks that are owned by many companies. They buy currency from the government at about 2 cents on the bill or something like that and turn around and loan it to the government at face value...the value of the currency is supposed to be backed by precious metals and by the loans that it makes to the government...however there isn't enough precious metal to actually cover the currency in circulation and in addition the loans that the government has taken out over the years could never actually be paid back to the system. They could recall all currency in circulation and not actually be able to pay off the loans.  Also it seems that the government has been bankrupt since the 40's or so...and that since then the government has been actually operating under bankruptcy laws of some sort or another. All of it is really interesting.  While I cannot vouch for the validity of this site...it does raise interesting questions that may need to be looked into.  Check it!   It is all very interesting that we the people may not actually own the currency we have and that we may never actually be out of debt. It also raises the question why would the congress try to give away control over currency that is strictly forbidden by the Constitution. Strange indeed...  I am in no doubt that the entire system will colapse. It may not happen anytime soon but it eventually will and our way of life, our nation will fall by the wayside at some point. It is the natural life cycle of things. All great empires or nations go through a period of time where they are at the top then fall or are revamped (after all Brittian while still a monarchy has actually become quite democratic and the monarchy is more of a figurehead then anything). I just hope that when we fall it isn't at the hands of foreigners....I hope that we can rebuild our system internally that ends up being stronger and better than before based off of the very documents that were written over two hundred years ago...of course with some changes...but the basic framework can work if protected and executed faithfully.  Me...

      There may just be a new debate over taxes after this little footnote in Legal History...read it for yourself.  Yes folks Taxes are still voluntary and there is no law explicitely saying you have to pay taxes...or at least as far as the Federal Courts in Memphis are concerned there are no laws saying that.  So stop sending your money to our corrupt government and take it back...   Are Taxes Legal...Do we have to pay them?

      Nothing to report today.  Tomorrow will be an action packed day of phone calls and such. I have a lot to do...or something like that.  Plus I need to get a hold of Jesse...if you read the blog Jesse I have a slightly different configuration for you and it is a little better in some aspects...more practical as well.  Well I am going to play a short game of SOF2 then head to bed.

      We did a lot of pricing today...and still there is a long way to go.  Got through a few things. We now have an account over at eBay...so that is good. Now I just need to get a few things posted.  This week I have a lot of things going on. First I have a computer that a bud of mine is wanting to build. I revised the plans to save a few bucks and now I need to get a hold of his ass so he can see the lower price yet still kick ass computer setup we are looking at. (Saved around 600 bucks I think...he wants an Uber Box).  Second I have a job on Tuesday. A student of mine has requested that I come out because he has some questions about some things. That is at 1PM. As far as I know I can work. I really don't know what to tell my guy as I don't know how long I will be. I might be there and hour, but with this guy in the past it has drug on to maybe two or more.  Third I think I have a Doctor appointment this week on Wednesday. If things are as rotten as I suspect (and how I feel) then I will most likely get a short vacation from the ankle bracelet (I can't have it on when in the hospital...hehehe). So that is coming up.  Fourth I also need to talk to my jailor because before all this crap was going on I was volunteering my time at the local library teaching a computer class at the rate of one or two classes a month depending on demand. Once I started getting sick I had to stop it. Now that I have got a pattern down for this crap I can make a night a month to teach I am sure. I think I may be able to get that through.  Also I got a tentative job offer. While it isn't in my field...and isn't something I really have this huge interest in...a family friend needs help maybe two days out of the week, and I need to be able to get out of the house and make a few dollars without blowing my Government Benefits. So this may be a way to do that. It would be running a kiosk in a mall. So hey...that might just be kewlio.  Well I am tired (as I slept only about an hour last night before I woke up and tossed and turned trying to get back to sleep)...so I think I will forgo the normal routine and just get to sleep.  Peace all!

      I finally got all of the boxes working right. We have to send back Jesse's Nvidia 5900 Ultra 256MB card because it draws to much power from the XPC power supply. We are going to change it to a 5600...it will be almost as fast.  Had to format his drives and get everything to play nice...then I worked on his old computer which he is giving to his dad. All in all I have spent way to much time in front of different computer screens over the past 48 hours...but getting it working was well worth the time and energy. There is nothing like completing a project.   He built up a nice box...here are the specs. Shuttle XPC Base 2.4GHz P4 at 2.52GHz 1 Gig o' fast ass RAM 2 * 200GB Hard drives Sound Blaster Audigy 2 EX (live drive couldn't fit but the card works) Nvidia GF 4200 64mb RAM to be upgraded to a 5600 128MB RAM when it comes in.  Overall it is a fast ass machine. Plus it looks good to. The clear panel on it kinda glows with the power LED (which is blue)...it is badass! I will try and get a pic of it tomorrow if I remember and post it.  Got to get out today...that was kewl. Spent two hours with Jesse just bullshitting and doing things...plus had a Primanti Brothers sandwich...that was good (note to self look up spelling of sandwich just in case).  Tomorrow have a dude coming to look at some of these mini-helmets we have...hopefully he will take some of them off our hands. We sure as hell don't need them. From those funds I would build my mom a system similar to mine...cause her box is dead.  Well I am sick and tired so I am going to crash for a bit.  Love to all out there in Cyber Land.  Peace

      Well today has been a long day...we have been fighting with Jesse's new computer...got it all running and a power supply that was included seemed to be dead...grooowwwlll! Then the haus of a video card he ordered up just won't play nice in these XPC boxes...just not enough wattage from the power supply to keep the beast fed.  Tomorrow will hold interesting times as I try to complete it and have it tweeked and tuned...  Stay tuned for yet another saga of..."Building a computer" cue echo!  Peace

      Jesse will be here tomorrow. I am building his computer and I am actually looking forward to it. He got some hot stuff and I wanna see how fast it is and get that puppy purring. It will be k-rad.  To everyone out there worried I want to re-assure you that I am not ignoring my health. I am doing everything that I can to stay as well as I can until this coming Wednesday when I have an appointment. When I go I will be headed to the hospital that day or maybe the next depending on when they can get a bed for me.  So until then I will soldier on...plus when I go in I will be more than likely going into the ICU for a few days because I have to be de-sensitised again to Pennicillian drugs...or at least the one they will put me on. It isn't so bad because in the ICU they wait on you hand and foot and are glad when they have a semi-concious patient...and I am always at least that.  Well I am going to kinda head to bed as I need to get a little rest...I will post a little longer tomorrow as I will be showing Jesse around his new box as well as showing him more about this blog service. I am also thinking about making a custom layout and see how that goes...I may just fool with the colours though...who knows.  Till tomorrow...peace out everyone.  Again thanks to those who read the site, and even more thanks to those who write me. I enjoy getting email and I would love to get more.

      Well over the last two days I have seen several appearances by Jim Hightower on his book "Thieves In High Places". What he says makes sense and he certainly has no love for our "president". Check out his site...the link is on the right.  I haven't been to bed yet...didn't get any sleep last night as I was working on my mothers computer only to find out there is just no hope for it.   So now I am going to bed after I update myself on todays events.  Goodnight

      Ok so no sleep for me...I ended up trying to fix my moms computer...and boy was it a task to figure out there is just nothing that could be done for it.  I tried swapping motherboards, video cards, hard drives, ram...tried all sorts of things...just everything I have for her is old and broke down...what I built for her this last time was pretty much the last of my spare parts that would work together so it is no surprise that the computer finally gave out. Hell the processor alone was from back in the days (1998)...so it was about time that it all died.  Now I am trying to get my laptop up and running at least half assed so she can have something if she needs it. Updating it as I type.   I also got some pics to share with you all...they are now uploading and I will have them posted shortly.

      Ok so I cleaned my room yet again and fixed it up a little better...I will post a pic tomorrow of it as my camera is downstairs right now and I don't want to go get it...did I mention that I am lazy?  Well not much to tell. I ordered a twenty dollar part for my computer...it was five bucks to ship it...jeesh...but I need that part badly  What else...I dunno.  Jess will be coming in this week for me to build his computer so that will be kewlio...I will get at least one visitor while I am on house arrest...plus he makes me laugh on the inside...hahaha  I am also planning to get a day while he is here to go out and at least grab lunch with him...have to run it by my officer but I don't think he will mind awfully much as he wants me to get out more often so I don't go berserk...he is a nice guy.  Well I am going to watch the rest of A Guy Thing and then I am getting some sleep.  Oh yeah did anyone see the new Man Show last night...Rogaine Blows donkey balls...he just isn't funny at all. Stanhope shows hope as he is just as funny as Adam and Jimmy...Rogan had a game show spoof of identify the ass crack or something like that. The funny thing about that is it shows just how much of a tool he really is. He is nothing but a brownose little bastard with bad hair. He really had to kiss ass to get this job.  Also did anyone see tonights Daily Show with John Stewart...well he is funny as hell and I think that show is probably one of the finest pieces of television programming anyone ever conceved. I am just so glad they are there to make fun of it all because if they weren't then the news would be soooo depressing.  Peace

      Again I must say RealVNC kicks ass...  Wow...today I was laying on the couch and realized how sick I am...and that sucks. I have to make it through another week and a half then I will be in the hospital...guaranteed...that will be a nice vaction.  There is no doubt about me going in...and I am not blowing the horns for nothing...I can barely breath...but I can't go in just yet as I have to build a computer at the end of the week for my friend and plus I don't have an appointment until the 27th...  Oh the joys of lung disease...  Eesh...  Ann Richards (former Dem. Gov. of Texas before Bush) was on Larry King live a few days back and they ran her interview a couple of times this weekend. While I never really liked her she made some great points...and after having seen her interview I gained new respect for her because she was very outspoken and well spoken about Bush and his policies inside of Texas...she also gave a psuedo endorsment to Dean which was cool.    Dean for Pres!   And Brian...did you get mom's message...she is coming around to Dean...finally! She especially liked his views and ideas about health care and insurance. I think she may just vote for him...and for those who don't know my mom...she is a staunch republican and has done a lot of defending up until I started opening her eyes to his policies and what he has done to hurt america (bush)...now she is coming around especially after I told her this next thing.   Abuse of power   Cnet write up on it   This websites author and proprietor was convicted of a Federal Felony for providing what would be construed as sketchy instructions for making a molitove coctail. Now this information is widely available around the internet and much worse information is available elsewhere. What makes this different is the political intervention to convict him. He was convicted of some obscure federal law that basically says that if you hand out instructions on how to make bombs and such with the explicit intention that followers follow through and make and use them you are breaking the law.  Nowhere on his site have I read that people should go out and violently take over the government or use weapons to wage war against it. However he was charged under this law.   What is really interesting is this. Under the USA Patriot Act he was eligible for a 20 year increase in sentence because of certain domestic terrorist wording contained within it. The Federal Prosecutor made this very clear and thus forced him into making a deal instead of going to trial because he was facing a 20 year sentence if convicted. The twist is they initially offered him 4 months or something like that if he would just plead guilty. Sounds strange.   What got me was Ashcroft put out a memo to keep track of Federal Judges who go under the recomended sentencing guidelines with things like co-operation and such. He wants to put together a list of Judges who will give the maximum all the time so that Prosecutors can use those courts instead of more liberal or level headed courts. Also this list would be used to figure out who would be advanced based on who gives out the hardest sentences.   Now what he was doing was excercising his First Amendment Right in saying that people should protest the government...there is no doubt about that yet he still got a year in prison (the judge called him a threat to security) for essentially exercising the right. Kind of scary if you think about it. Hopefully someone in the ACLU will take notice and take the case to get him out and have his record expunged plus give him reimbursment for his rights being denied.   The site isn't friendly. The site may not be right in what it preaches...but regardless the idea of free speech and the right to it is absolute and should never be taken away...regardless of how disgusting or disturbing it may be.   I watched a show on Nazi's in America and they had a similar thing happening in a little town outside of Chicago. A Nazi party wanted to have a rally and a march down to the courthouse of this little town (which had at the time the largest per capita Jewish Community in the US). The town banned it and then tried to regulate what kind of rallies could be held. The organiser took the town to court and eventually it came before the Supreme Court and they upheld the Parties right to congregate and have the march saying it was protected under the First Amendment. The case was even fought by the ACLU and a Jewish Lawyer who basically said that he may not agree with them, he may think that it is hate speech, but regardless no one should be able to trample their right to say what they want to say...even if he didn't agree with it.   Free speech protects all speech...it is there to protect the ugly side of humanity. It allows them to be able to voice their opinions regardless of what others think and allows them to be able to put it out there into the public...because that is what our country is founded on. Being able to say what we want when we want about whom we want as long as it isn't libelous or slanderous...and that even protects Charicatures of people (as seen in Flint v. That hate spewing preacher).  Something that might be taken into thought is this (mind you I hate no group of people based on Race, Religion, or Orientation because I hate everyone) but the Nazi's had one thing almost right (it wasn't at the time but it is true now). The Jewish community controls governments throughout the world through its control of the Banking system. While I don't believe openly that it is a Jewish conspiracy...it is still a fact that most of the major money in the world through banks is controlled by Jewish businessman. They don't openly bring their political views into the the business of banking, but I bet if the Palistinian Authority (which is the ritefull Palistinian governing body) went to get any substantial loans from the World Bank to help them set up a viable government they wouldn't get the loans. Think about it...fire back at me if you think differently.  One thing I do believe in...the US Government most certainly protects Jewish interests in the Middle East at the cost of Billions to the US taxpayer and by doing so also puts us in greater danger than any other arrangement we have made with governments around the world. With our protection Israel has become the 6th largest Nuclear State secretely...and single handedly caused the Middle East Arms race that was taken on by Iraq and Iran. In addition to being protected and unacknowledged the nation of Israel has also commited horrible environmental damage because of this program and have kept the one person who spoke out against it jail for 18 years (Venunu...look him up...what happened to him is a crime).   Now I put my soapbox away...and with that I will leave you with a final thought that has been expressed by Jewish people in Israel...it is not Anti-Semetic to speak out against the Israeli government and its policies, instead it is the attempt to bring them into the world community and hold them as accountable for their actions as the World Jewish population wanted the Nazi party leaders to be held accountable after WW2.

      So I am going to try and get some sleep now. Who knows maybe it will actually work this time round...  Not much to report on today. I remotely connected to my friends computer so that I could use his system to order exactly what he wanted from  NewEgg  using a little program called RealVNC. I tell you that is a damn neat little program to play with. I think that will be of great use in the future when helping people out.  Anyways off to bed.

      Take a gander a Devon's blog...she addresses something that I have spent much time thinking about personally. Why are smart people so inept at social interaction, and why are dumb people so good at it.  It's worth thinking about.   Smart people are pent up all day with other smart people and have little time to pratice their social graces therefore letting their social graces slip. Dumb people (usually pretty people) spend all day talking to each other making fun of the smart people and therefore are always honing their skills at socializing.   My take on it.

      Ok so today was a washout. I slept most of the day. This weekend took a lot out of me. First Jesse was here. Second we had some guy come in and look at our collectables. Now it wouldn't have been so bad but he literally went through it like a tornado and didn't put anything back...plus he was rough with some of it because he wasn't interested in it (like star wars figures and spawn stuff)...  He wants a lot of the shit...but I don't think he will come back with a price that will be reasonable. He was going through the mini-helmets and wants them all but I think he thinks that we were going to leave the most valuable in the group and he would just pay 9 or 10 per helmet even for the autographed ones (which we have a few that are valued at around 150 bucks). Well that ain't gonna fly at all. Also he just wants all the cards (even the graded cards we have) but again I think he thinks that he will get it all for nothing...but he won't. He will have to come up with at least 40 percent of book value.   So that is why I am tired. Plus I am also pretty ill. I go Wednesday to see the doc...so I expect I will be headed to the hospital that evening or Thursday. So in the meantime I have to wash clothes and get ready just in case. If I do go it will be a relief because it will be a vacation from my house as I see it...plus I will not have to really cook...all I have to do is order food.  Well I am going to try and get some sleep again...peace out ya'll.

      After much fighting with my USB 2.0 controller on my XPC it is now working up to spec. I just had to get the right driver and now it is giving me full speed burning love. I moved my TDK 48x into an external drive setup on USB 2.0 and it wasn't wanting to burn at anything greater than 2x...now with the proper driver it burns at full 48x....yay!!!!  I moved my DVD into the case in the free drive bay vacated by the burner. It blends more smoothly with the entire system now that I have the face painted silver. I also did the TDK's face silver but it still has a blue translucent drive bay cover. It looked out of place on the silver system. Now it all looks good.  I am just glad I was able to get something working tonight.  Peace outie yo!

      Well Jesse got home and then his computer started acting up again....little fucker. Mostly it was stuff that I had installed but now didn't want to work. Great...so I logged in over the network and looked at it.  Seems the video card is acting up...it is sending distorted information out...and I saw it. I think the card just doesn't like it in there and when he gets his new card it will be fixed.  The Processor is registering funny...it is running a 2.4GHz but registering as something else...great...  Also he can't find his original driver disk for his Audigy 2 Platinum card and you can't just download the drivers off of Creative's Website (which is strange in itself)...this is just all fubar...I have never had this much trouble with a system...plus I can't just sit in front of it and monkey with it till it works...it is a couple hundred miles from here.  I should hopefully be able to figure it all out...given a little time...but this is just frustrating because again I have never had so much trouble...with the exception of my mom's pc.  What else...well I painted my CD-Burner and DVD Drive to match my case and external drive case...now it all matches up nicely. That went pretty easily once I figured out how to get the right texture to match.  Well I am tired and I think I am going to get some rest. I am searching for solutions to the problems posed above...hopefully I will find them easily.  Peace out...and never fear I am still a computer guru...I just need time to figure out the problem.

      Wow am I tired...you wanna know how tired...juwanna know....juwannow...well I am more tired than an overworked hooker in Bangkok...do you know how hard they work down there? Pretty damn hard.  Well I saw Jesse off today...got his box up and running after we encountered another problem. I went to turn reboot it today and when I did...damn thing just wouldn't....so I had to rebuild the software...had to do the same to mine as well...it sucked ass.  I think it was A: A virus because both computers exhibited the same thing, B: A bad patch from Microsoft, C: Really bad luck. I just don't know...but I did get his up and running and mine was a little easier to do.  Right now my body is so tired that my face is cold...I'm not physically cold...but my nose and upper cheeks are. It is like they can't get enough blood to them to get em warm...my eyes are droopy as well.  Well I think I am going to hit the sack...I am tired.  Night all

      More of the same from outside sources.   Jeesh...the more I read the less convinced I am about all this "War On Terror" and shit   Story   I will try and encode the "Unanswered Questions" Video tonight depending on what is going on...  Tomorrow I start working for a friend of the family...so I will be out most of the day.  I  will update later on...as right now I am doing five things at once...plus I am getting Jesse's computer back up and running like a little kitten.  Peace

      Well yesterday the 11th passed with little much more than a lot of rememberance shows.   Jesse updated his blog. It is a good read from a different perspective.   Well I don't have much to say except that I was able to tape the GNN Unanswered Questions show. So I will digitize it soon and may offer it up somehow or another. It really is a good watch. I will just have to check and see what restrictions are on it. Hopefully I can post it.  I am still waiting on Jesse's Video Card to come in. It should have been here today but I expect I will get it tomorrow. As soon as I get it I can get it installed and running in his box and get the rest of the niggling problems fixed up as well.   I have a job now. It is a little kiosk at a local mall selling boutique pet stuff. So we will see how that goes. It starts this Sunday.  Also I have to get my resume' typed up again so I can send it off to a company that I know I would be qualified to do. It would be great experience if nothing else.   Well I am tired and today has been taxing. So I think I will hit the sack...  Peace

      Another year has passed since that fateful day in 2001. Another year of events has come and gone. Another year of fear and agony. Another year of lies and deciet.  I morn for those who lost loved ones. I cry for the children who lost fathers and mothers. I ache for the pain that we have enflicted on the world around us.   The people that died, and have died since 9-11-2001 are all heroes in my eyes. Many have paid with their lives for the intolerance of but a few on both sides of the fence. It is not the people in power who have anything to worry about as we have seen.   Bush, Cheney, Blair, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, bin Laden, and Hussein are all still alive and well, yet they are the architects of the new world we live in. A world of fear and hate towards each other that has boiled into war that has only hurt the poor, hungry, and those less fortunate than others.  Out of this hate will come a new world, and with a little luck that new world will be better. I don't hold much hope for that because out of every great tragedy throughout history there have been those that have hoped for our world to be better, and their hope is lost.  The only thing that I can ask out of this period of time is that maybe, just maybe the little people will end up coming out on top.  There are many questions surrounding what went on and what is going on now. Should we be in Iraq? Have we been lied to? Who is benefiting from all this bloodletting? Could it all have been prevented? The answers aren't all that simple, but one thing is to be sure. We won't know for many years what we have reaped through our policy now.  Inform yourselves, ask questions, question everything, expect our leaders to live up to promises, expect our leaders to lead us, lead ourselves, set policy, become understanding.  In all we all need to sit back and take a breather then come back to the table and start to ration things out. In the end the mistakes of today will be reaped by our children and our grandchildren so if we are to make the mistakes at least let them be made out of the idea that we are trying to do the best thing.  Some readers out there may be pro-war, some anti-war. Either way it doesn't matter to me because you can't change my mind, but I will never discourage you from voicing your view and opinion as I would expect you would do the same for me.   We could all use a lesson in tolerance, because without that we are lost.   Unanswered Questions   GNN   Infowars   Al Jazeera   BBC New   CNN   These are links to different places around the net. I have included one conspiracy theory site, two outside or alternative news sites, one site for their side, one neutral site (BBC News has become one of the most balanced news organizations in the world), and one site that is firmly American (although maybe a little to the left sometimes).  Visit them all and take in the sights and sounds. Each gives you information. Draw your own conclusions from the information provided. Once you have then at least they will be informed unlike so many others out there.  Remeber to practice tolerance and moderation. Love your fellow human as your religion may dictate, and if you aren't religious then respect your fellow human as you would want to be respected.  I'll leave it with this much over used by drugged out Raver's Motto.  P.L.U.R. (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect)

      Last night I had the most detailed dream I think that I have ever had and it scared the piss out of me. Basically I was an experiment or am turned into a living experiment which goes in conjunction with other dreams that I have had over the past six months or so.   In this strange dream I had sex with this girl and then it was found out that I carry a strain of a very lethal new type of disease that had been bread in me through all of the hospital stays that I have had over the past years. It is a competely new strain of disease that seems to have no cure outside of the fact that I am still living despite it wiping out major amounts of population. I get blamed for infecting all these people and the government is after me because of it, but the kicker is that I was used as a breeding ground for the disease by the government for a new Bio-Weapon that they don't want people to know about. Something that if people knew the existance of then anarchy and overthrow of the government would happen.   You could say that I was the Nexus of the disease...but not that I was the only one, many other CF patients are also infected with the similar agents in the attempt to create a new superbug type thing that could be used.   The name of the bug is E. Plura, E. Pulma, or E. Pulmo or something like that. It is basically a nasty bug that acts in a similar way to HIV/AIDS as it can be spread sexually or even through the air when the bug is active and not dormant. The difference about the bug is that its effects are fast acting and people just stop dropping dead all over the place with no real explanation as to what it is. The CDC is brought in but can't figure it out and they are scrambling for answers, but they are not really looking for a cure or treatment but to get me and a few others that were infected and seemingly show no signs of illness. At first they think it is a new strain of especially viralant HIV/AIDS because it kills in a similar manor by attacking the immune system then giving them a severe lung infection that breaks down the lungs eventually leading to death. The mortality rate of the new superbug is in the high 90% range.  The government is chasing after me after having identified me as one of the nexus to the new disease, while most of my friends are captured I am able to ellude them through shrewd cunningness on my part and link up with a group of scientists that are trying to figure out what is going on.   At one point I am in what could be considered a bubble shack that keeps me isolated from the people looking to stop it and I start coughing up this mess that is just disgusting and bloody...but not like anything that I have ever seen come out of my body. I play an integral role in figuring out what it is and how to stop it and I along with the scientists that I am working with are working to stop it but the government has other ideas.   They have the city cordoned off so that people can't get in or out and have it locked down pretty tight with the military. Instead of trying to stop it they decide to expand the experiment and start spraying the raw bio-weapon into the air telling people that it is an agent that will help kill off the bug. We go through some adventures to stop that and really piss them off. The government really wants to get a hold of me and get me back into a lab to culture and bring this back under wraps.  I along with others are able to get the information of the new bug out to the world so they can get into gear to stop it. Meanwhile the government is blaming terrorists for the new bug even though they created it. To keep us quiet about what we know they go to all lengths to kill us off or capture me as I am not seemingly sick from it...just a super carrier of the bug.   Now this dream I think stems from the idea that I was thinking about the other day in the hospital and pondering while I was there. It has to do with the fact that CF patients are breeding grounds for very nasty and resiliant little bugs. Over time with out lung infections and the responding coarses of anti-biotics have indeed made newer more robust versions of bugs that are becoming harder and harder to treat. Basically we are living bio-weapons labs in the sense that we bread these bugs as a side effect of treating ourselves with modern drugs. I know for a fact that my little bugs have become resistant to all but a few drugs left out there and with the current rate of reocurring infections pretty soon they will be out of drugs to treat me with that would be effective. We would make for a good ground to try out new drugs and also breed resistant strain of psuedomonis strains simply because even though we get treated with all the latest and greatest drugs you simply can't kill all of them when you treat for a lung infection. So the survivors in the lungs become stronger and mutate over several times of treatment quickly becoming resistant to the drugs used to originally treat them with.   This isn't so far fetched an idea. We could be being used to breed new dangerous strains of bugs that could very well be weaponized and if ever used would wipe out massive amounts of population quickly especially in second and third world nations that don't have access to the latest and greatest of drugs. It makes me wonder what happens to the mucus that I am constantly giving to them to send off to test for resistance of the bugs. They have to isolate the bugs and then culture them, then try and kill them with anti-biotics. It is not so far fetched that you could develop a plan of resistance that would keep the patient relatively healthy for a period of time all the while using them us as living incubators (becuase ultimately you would need to be able to get it into humans to see the effects and we also make the process go faster...our bugs may mutake on the order of twice as fast as they can do it in the lab).   This scares me greatly because I don't want to be that at all. However I could most certainly see our government using already sick people who are chronically sick to test new things on and develop weapons out of us. Why not...it makes sense to me. It is a hell of a lot cheaper to incubate a live virus or bug in a living host and build it up to be ruthlessly efficient at making people deathly ill.  When I woke from my dream I was shaking and literally scared that this may be happening...and why not? Again we already know that America has a very active Bio-Weapons research program even though we claim to have none. It makes sense to keep the project under wraps because we signed treaties stating we wouldn't develop those weapons...but they can culture them in the medical field and call it a natural progression of disease without raising much suspicion.  It is sad that I have so little trust in the government. I think they know a lot more about things than we know and yet we pay for them to keep it hidden from us.  I have often thought what would happen if you got a group of about a thousand people to storm Area51 and other top secret we don't have these bases they don't exist places...if you had a large enough group with the balls to storm the compound in a peaceful manor they simply can't get rid of a thousand people without someone noticing. They just can't kill us all and make us disapear...so why not do it sometime and find out really what our tax dollars are developing.   Again I feel that we are being lied to on a much grander scale than we even can fathom.   So what does this mean all in all...yes folks I am a firm believer that we have been visited by something other than humans here on Earth. There is simply to much credible information out there to deny that something is going on. I believe we need the truth because if we are up against something much bigger and bad ass as ourselves don't you think it would be better to know so that the world could band together and be ready for whatever may come out way? I think so.  Lemme know what you think...  I am also going to write up the full story and maybe do some illustrations as to what I saw in the dream. It scared the piss out of me.  You heard it hear first folks. E. Plura, E. Pulma, or E. Pulmo...if those come out sometime I thought of them first...and all through a lousy dream. I tried to google the terms and came up with nothing of significance...if you find anything remotely resembling this email me and let me know...as always you can get me over on the side bar there under "Email Me" link.  I hope I am wrong...but the last time I had a dream that vivid and detailed the dream came true in many ways...that is why it scares me.

      One thing that I didn't tell all earlier is about my shipment of drugs that came from Chartwell.  As usual they kind of screwed things up. You see Chartwell loves to send out way to many supplies, but they never can seem to send the supplies I might need. Today they called to find out what supplies I needed and we went through a list and sure enough they didn't send the proper stuff, like dressing kits for my port. They also have the uncanning ability to screw up dosage orders and such as well. On my Benedryl order they have me taking 50mg IV push of the stuff...however I only need about 25mg to get by on. At the 50mg dose I probably would barely get it into me before I would go into a mild coma for an hour or so, or at least what I like to call the "fog of concentrated benedryl". I wouldn't even get to hooking myself up to the anti-biotic it is supposed to keep me from having a reaction too. So I am having to adjust dosages.   Well that is all. I finally posted the hospital blog. It is a little different format with the oldest post being first and the latest last...my bad. Oh well I am sure the people reading this are intelligent enough to figure it out seeing that I did happen to put a Date and Time stamp on the posts.  Peace.  Did I mention I am severely upset by the way things are going in our country and I am glad that at least if Bush isn't beaten in this upcoming election that people will most likely be awakened to the idea that he and his people (except Powell...he is still clean in my book. I don't believe that he believes the crap he is instructed and scripted to say) don't have what's best for the country in mind, only that which is best for them and their people. I just hope people wake up and see that he is pulling us down a path that will only lead to our ultimate untimely demise at the hands of the very people he claims he is fighting.   To fight terror with terror only begets terror. The Israeli's have written the book on that. If only the Government would read it.

      To get a full cold boot on my laptop takes forever...never noticed it till now. Well it is old and stuffed full of an oversized OS for its little Celeron 366 Processor so I guess I can't complain to much, at least it runs...sort of. Plus it has been off network for a few weeks so it is now searching for updates of coarse!   Here we go!  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  8.27.2003  11:45PM Well today I came into the hospital. I know that I wont be able to update regularly for people out there if at all so I am going to go ahead and keep a blog of while I am in. It will be kind of a play by play as to what happens.  So today I got here around 5:30 or so in the evening. As usual when I get here things are initially unorganized. Just kind of getting things going is a little anticlimactic. When you think of hospitals you think that things get done boom boom boombut not really. It takes a while for orders to come through and you have to be asked the same questions at least 10 times just in case someone missed it the first time around.   That is probably the most frustrating part of coming into the hospital or even seeing your doctor. They literally ask the same questions over and over. Six people see you and ask you the same battery of questions and you just think do these people ever talk to each other or write notesor hell if someone does write a not do the rest of the doctors not bother to read the notes. I mean come onI am patient about that with residents and interns and such but I still would think it would be nice if they read each others notes.   As for things getting going my port wasnt accessed until later this evening. Fortunately it didnt hurt so bad to get it accessed as it has in the past. However now it is just sitting here accessed but no meds are going in just yet. That brings me to the boom boom boom part. Well again it takes time to get all the orders through. So I am waiting until midnight until my first med will come uplooking up at the clock it reads 12:10AM and still no medsdoh!  So this is where I am at right now. I am just waiting for everything to get started. I guess it will all trickle to a full firehose of activity over the next 12 hours.   Of coarse I will be bored over the next few days or however long this will take so I will updating this thing over and over again so there will be one big entry when I get back home and then it will broken into the date and then times as to when it was wrote. That will at least keep my mind preoccupied, which will certainly be needed over the next few days.  Something that is kinda kewlio is that I am getting a break from the house and the oh so k-rad anklet so that is a bonus. I will also try and take a few pics while I am here. I brought the camera so I will snap some shots off as I see something that might be good to get shots of.  Peace out for the eve.  8.28.2003  6:47PM They finally got my medication to me at about 1:15AM so that is when I actually started the IVs. I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep last night I just kept tossing and turning and when I finally did get to sleep it certainly wasnt good sleep because when I was woken up this morning for the normal ritual of taking temps and blood pressure I was running a fever of 101F. So needless to say I burned off a few brain cells last night. Also when they got me up it felt like someone had worked me over with a baseball bat and I was extremely uncomfortable.   All day today I have felt pretty bad overall. I have had a screaming headache and it just wont go away. I have had on and off sweats and chills. My body still feels like someone is beating me up. My joints are just balls of pain and that sucks. When I was last in one of the drugs that I was on made my face, lips, and tongue numb, well it is happening again.   This is the bad thing about coming into the hospital because when I am at home things dont really hurt that badly. When I actually get into the hospital parts just stop working and I end up on pretty bad pain and the doctors are reluctant to put me on anything for the pain because the meds I am on will put an even greater strain on my already overworked kidneys.   So I sit here feeling just disconnected and uncomfortable. I hope tonight that I can get some good rest because I am tired (even though I have slept throughout the day).  Till the next installmentwoah!  8.29.2003  2:45PM  Last nights sleep was no better than the night before. It turns out that I am having a slight allergic reaction to the drugs I am on.  I am allergic to penicillin which sucks because all my little bugs are only responsive to penicillin and not so responsive to other drug bases (like sulfa drugs). So I am having an allergic reaction to the penicillin base in Zosyn which is causing me to have these hellacious fevers. This morning I woke up with a 102F feveryeah brain stew is my gew that plants in the skull.  Also something of note is that my oxygen saturation seems to be falling off at night. When they wake me up in the morning they usually take my temp, blood pressure, and then O2 sats. Well yesterday I woke up with my O2 sat at around 88 and this morning it was around 87 or so. My lowest level yesterday was 84. Now these sats should normally be up around 98 or 99 or 100 for a healthy person and normally I run around 96, but now I am down to a norm of 94 or 93. It just sucks that I have to know all of this stuff.  One thing that being on oxygen is it only helps you feel a little better overall. See the problem is that you get the good stuff in of coarse because you have a great deal of it in your lungs so it cant help but get into your body, however your body cant get the bad stuff out of your blood fast enough. So while you add the good stuff you dont necessarily get the bad stuff out fast enough. That knocks people all out of whack and that really I would guess could be a problem that would eventually affect the chemistry of your blood.   Overall though my stay so far has been pretty good and I have actually gotten a lot of rest so I am looking forward to a few more days of this. Plus you cant complain when you are almost being waited on hand and footthat is never a bad thing.  Oh well. I may update a little later.   3:25PM  ELMO TEACHES INVESTING!!! Ok okit isnt bad enough that we already teach young children today to be consumer whores, but now some folks up at Wall Street are going to introduce a video featuring Elmo and talks about investing. Really it is aimed at helping parents to talk with their children about the value of investing. Will this video also cover why mommy and daddy dont have a job right now? Will the video cover how Mr. Lay has untold millions while all the people who invested in what was pushed as a great investment are now broke with some being destitute as well? Oh ohwait will the video cover what is acceptable business practices?   If only people could see that absurdity of it all. We are now hawking our childrens children futureour government has borrowed so much money and has such a large debt that we could never ever pay off the debt. However it is ok to tell little Billy to put his nickels in a piggy bank and when he has enough saved up he can go ahead and buy a share of Halliburton.   I am baffled by it all really.   8.31.2003  4:06PM  I am disappointed in myself because I didnt write yesterday. Really I didnt want to write today but I decided that I better just get on and write.   In my visit with Dr. Weinberg today I learned that indeed according to blood tests I am allergic to Penicillin and that really sucks. Why does is suck? Well my little bugs are all responsive to penicillin and not so responsive to other classes of drugs. So now Dr. Weinberg is waiting for my sputum cultures to come back so he can see what exactly he has left to treat me with. Ohhh boy I am looking forward to seeing that because last time I saw one of those reports it basically said that the bugs were only sensitive to combinations of penicillin drugs and not much else.   Today was kind of nice because I had this hot little number beating on me for my P.T. which was kewlI really wanted to say you could beat me anytimebut I wasnt really ready to be really beaten up. I imagine she would have a very large guy in her life that would easily beat me to within a mere smudge of my life. However she was really cute and I would have done some dirty dirrty things with her.   She did make one comment that I almost seized upon because it would have been pretty good. She said that her face was itchy and it was because of her allergies. I countered with what are you allergic too? She replied that her allergies really kick up in August. My reply was almost thisits ok you can say your allergic to me. I have that effect on women. Now that would have been sadly true. Women that I am even remotely attracted to I have this effect of driving them away as if I had a helmet on my head, drool running down my chin, a swastika carved in my forehead, and a knife in my hand screaming out I love you, I love you! Yeah it can be that bad sometimes. So you can imagine if you saw that youd run. Fortunately I save that look for the weekends and I only go hunting in the middle of the week. So you can say that I am repellent to women in general. I always fall into that friend categorywhich isnt so bad but it has the unfortunate position of being sexless.   I also have a cute little nurses aidactually several, one who is my age maybe a little younger. She is cute but has made clear (even though I never made any kind of I wanna hump you vibes towards hermaybe I just come off desperate all the time) that she has a boyfriend. Hey thats kewlio because while sure I wouldnt kick ya out of bed for eating crackers I havent even invited ya into my bed yet, so slow down girly. The other aid is a little older than I ambut she is very attractive and I can tell she has something going on upstairs.   Speaking of nurses I have what may be, well I dont know how to explain this guy really. Something isnt right with him. He seems normal but I dont think he is. He is slow or shy or scared. Jeesh he was just here doing his checkup very strange. Other nurses just are like check, check donehe draws it out like he is scared to do something wrong. I dont really have any strange tubes coming out of me (well with the exception of my port in the chest) so he doesnt need to make sure they attached or anything. I just dont know. He must have had a nervous breakdown or something or maybe he is a special needs placement (hire the handicapped their fun to watch campaign).   Well my dinner is here way early. I am expecting a call from my dad. That was weird he came up to PA to visit his family in Greensburg and he gave me a call to see if I would run out to visit him, he didnt know I was in the hospital. So he said he would call me today and try to get down here. Now I am not complaining or anything because hell I dont really like people visiting me while I am this way (maybe that is why I am soo low maintenance with the staff here because even when I need something I dont ask unless it is an emergency) but since he made the trip all the way from MS to visit his family do you think that he could swing by the hospital to see his son. I dunno but I guess I would if I were him. He drives back to MS tomorrow (he drove up yesterday so he has only Sunday in town)I understand that he has only a little time up here but I would still like to see him. After all it has been over a year since I last saw him.  Also last night I puked again which wasnt pretty. The stuff in my stomach had so much acid in it that it burned my tongue badly as it was coming out. As a result it burned my esophagus and my vocal chords a bit. So I am horse and have throat pain (which sucks ass). My mouth is burned and my teeth feel like I have run steel wool over them until they were raw. Very strange indeed. When my Russian attending Doc saw me this morning he was like why you not tell last night and get somezing for that. You need tell us when you breaking so we can fix you with medicine. I wanted to reply I am not a whiney assed little American pussy but I dont know if that would have made him laugh or offended because he came here (and I presume has chosen our great nation as his home over wherever he is from). However that is what it is. The nurse twit that I had last night came in once to hook me up to my meds. She never came back until about 7AM this morning. So while I can take off my own IV hose hell it would have been nice for her to offer or even do it because after all it was her job. So she was never in to check on me or ask me how I was doing. I would have volunteered the info but I wasnt going to call for her, for all I know someone else down the hall was doing much worse.   Well enough of this writing for now. My mom is on her way down and my food is here (earlyway early). If I dont eat it she willhehehehe  PLUR  11:45PM  Well I learned that Daniel is in. I met her officially last week at clinic and I have known about her for a while. So I went over to visit with her and see how she is doing and we had a conversation for about 20 minutes. It was nice to talk to someone else my age who also talksthat is certainly different. Plus I guess it is just different to talk to what is your equal. I have friends who I talk to but I dont feel their equal or do I feel they are my equal in many ways, but tonight it was a little different because it was equal in most ways. It was almost like verbal diarrhea between the two of us and we kind of went over what each others boat isit was nice that there is someone else that is there too, but it is also kinda depressing because she is 27, I am 26, yet we both have to live in this terrible situation that only a few people get to experience first hand and no one would ever want to be in our shoes. I would never wish this on anyone anyways.  I found out a lot about her. Of coarse there is still much more to learn but I can pretty much tell that we have pretty similar experiences when it comes to life. She is a little worse off than I am in some ways as she is bad enough to be on the transplant list (as for myself when it comes time for that I wont be put on the list) but she isnt allergic to penicillin. Six one way, a half dozen the other. I imagine that I will be on her health level soon as far as the lungs are concerned because we cant use the big guns against the bugs right now...so I think I will be headed down that path soon.   So all in all it was nice to talk with someone else in the same type of boat that I am inwhat type of boat is that? It is a boat that is quickly sinking that has run out of tar to plug holes with and is overcapacity. Its only a matter of timebut will we make the time matter.  9.03.2003  2:34AM  The past few days have just seen me sleep a lot. That is all I have really done. I have been pretty boring.  Yesterday (or earlier today because I am still on yesterday as today) my cultures finally came back and Dr. Weinberg was able to see what my bugs are sensitive to. Well as he suspected they are pretty much only responsive to penicillin drugs. So he put me on Fortaz which on the bag it says that I am allergic to it although I dont know if I am allergic to it or not. The nurse thinks that it is a penicillin based drug so if it is I will be getting hives sooner or later, if it isnt then we may have found a drug they can use for the next few infections.   Also today I went down to get PFTs done (pulmonary function test). I had a set done last week which helped bring me into the hospital. There are several important numbers in these tests but the most important ones are the overall capacity of the lung and the small airway clearance or capacity of the lung. Well when I came in my overall capacity was 50% and my small airways number was 6% of normal function. My numbers have increased to a whopping 51% and 12%. The small airways really is the important one because it indicates the amount of scarring in the lung as well as that is where the work is really done on getting O2 and CO2 in and out of the body. If you have dismal scores on the small airways then you are going to feel like crap. Well I feel like crap but I feel better than I did when I first came in. So the low score explains all the resulting problems of low blood oxygen, headaches, and other things.  Outside of that not much else happened over the past few days. I saw Daniel again and we are going to be sure to exchange email addresses so that we can keep in touch. It will be good to have someone to talk to about this crap.  I also informed my mom today that I wouldnt seek out the transplant list when it comes time. I dont think that I really want to go through all of that. Partially because I dont want to endure the torture of waiting for something that I may not get, but also if I do get the lungs and heart that may be necessary then there is the possibility of my body rejecting them and it also doesnt make me any less penicillin allergic. My mom was a little shocked and wonders why I dont want to live? It isnt so much that I dont want to live, but more of a I have already lived enough let someone else have a shot kind of thing. Plus I am ready to move on whenever it is time. I dont want to hasten that arrival but I wont be mad when it gets here. If only we could all go quietly.  One thing that did come up today was the abortion doctor murderer in FL. is coming up for execution tomorrow. Today on CNN they had his spiritual guide dude on. Lemme tell you that the rhetoric that he was espousing was just as bad as any Taliban or Muslim Extremist out there. I pretty much decided that the spiritual advisor should be bumped off as well for good measure. Let him meet his maker so his maker can damn him to eternity for the hate that he espouses. I firmly believe that if you are one of those people in any religion that carries it twelve step beyond the edge than you are going to the place that you dont want to go. You will most likely end up in your religions hell. By the time you have stepped into that extremist realm it is a good bet you have already thrown away most of the doctrines and have abandoned for all intents and purposes what your religion teaches and therefore have abandoned your god.  Well it is late and I am hungry. I am going to get a bite to eat and then hit the sack and sleep for another day or so  Peace out.    9.4.2003  3:52PM  Well I did get on the internet the other night so I updated the site to let yall know what is up. It was a short update I know but it is something at least. When I get home I will upload this entire blog so you can get an idea of whats going on.  Well last night after having a few doses of Fortaz one of the drugs I am allergic too I finally started to see some allergic reaction. I turned pink and started to itch so they had to stop it. So today when Dr. Weinberg came in we came up with a semi game plan to go with. They will first dope me up with benedryl and then they will hit me with the anti-biotic and go from there. He basically said that they really couldnt desensitize me because I am having to little of a reaction to the drugs. If it was that I was swelling up and loosing an airway then they could work with thatme just turning red, pink, or other colour and itchy they really cant do much for that except treat the symptoms of that. So I will just have to deal. Benedryl kinda sucks because as soon as I am hit with it I sleep like a baby but without the rest part. Last night they hit me with 25mg of it and I was out in less than three minutes and they came back later to unhook me from the IV and I have no recollection of them coming in and doing that at all. So I go into a coma like vegetable state. So I guess I will just have to deal with that. Great  Today I got sick, just puked out of nowhere and that sucked ass. They had to give me some stuff for my stomach and that made me feel a little better. This whole hospital thing really does blow. I am getting to the point were I am ready to be heading home even though when I am at home I am in another prison of sorts. At least at home I can sit in my room naked without the danger of someone barging in. Also it will be nice to be back to my fat internet pipe so that when I sit nekkid I can watch some goddess screaming out faster, harder you big stud.   Well I think that I am going to lay back down. One thing I am looking forward to is the debate tonight amongst the Democratic hopefuls on PBS. It will be an interesting thing to see for sure and I am hopeful that Dean will be able to pull even further ahead.  Peace.  9.5.2003  5:37PM  Well they started me back on the regiment of Fortaz and benadryloh joy! I spent most of last night passed out and slept a lot. It was kind of nice but at the same time it was really what I call fake sleep. I didnt dream until early this morning so it wasnt really restful sleep.   I was told today that I might get out this coming Monday if all goes well and I continue to improve. That would be great because I am really starting to jones for a fat internet pipe. Whenever I get a new laptop I plan on getting it with a an 802.11G card so that I can have wireless internet and I think that I will also look into getting a cell phone internet card from someone like Sprint or something and maybe tie the bill onto my Cell phone plan. I just need some internet access anywhere I go cause I am such a geek and need to get my fix every few hoursI guess I am truly addicted to the internet. I just had a thoughtI wonder if Pocket PC devices can share their internet connections? Hmmmbecause if the can then I could possibly get this one phone that is really phat (pretty hot and tempting). It is a combination phone for Sprint Network. It has a phone, and small keyboard, and is a pocket pc device all in one, and it is a Vision phone so it links into the unlimited Sprint PCS vision plans that are out there. Now you can dock pocket pc devices up to your computer to trade information back and forth and the computer and the pocket pc see each other pretty equally. Now since this pocket pc device is connected to the internet I wonder if it will let you share the internet connection with the laptop or computer that you link it too. The reason I ponder this is because the device itself is pretty expensive but it would be cheaper to have it than it would be to get a separate PC card and plan for a laptop over a years time. So if it can share its internet connection seamlessly than that would be the way to goplus the phone is just k-rad!  Unfortunately PBS here in Pittsburgh didnt air the democratic debate and I am pretty pissed about that because I wanted to hear it all instead of just sound bites here and there. Hopefully they will play it soon because I am interested in seeing it all. If they dont then I will just have to hunt for the next debate.   Well I am going to wrap up this edition of my blog with this thought or opinion.  When watching Crossfire the other night on CNN the question is being raised should we have the UN help us in Iraq. Should we go to them to get support, troop, and money. Well here is my take on it. We went against the wishes of the world by invading Iraq. Instead we had a president come on tv and spout some catchy phrases and drum up just enough support here in the states. So here I go with my own catchy phrase using plain language that GW uses as he is such a great linguistYa bombed it, Ya bought it. We shouldnt be crying now that we cant afford it. The administration should have taken that into account a long time ago before they even really started kicking around invasion plans. Once they figured out a number or even tentative numbers they should have come to the American people with them saying it is going to cost X number of hundred billion dollars, which is what the CAO (Congressional Acounting Office) came up with a whopping 300 Billion dollars at the low end of the spectrum to rebuild them. That really doesnt even take into account how much it is costing for the military portion which if you look at how the dollars have fallen so far the ratio of military to reconstructing costs so far has been about 6 or 7 to 1. While this ratio will most certainly fall over time it will still cost us a lot of money to keep our troops deployed for the five years that it is estimated it will take to rebuild and get Iraq back up to steam. Now here is the important part of this argumentwho gets the money? Well we know that Halliburton will get a large chunk of that over time as they have an already large contract with the military, but the real robbery has yet to come. Many companies will of coarse get in on the action. Already many companies have announced that they have contracts for parts of the rebuilding, while many dollars will flow into companies not many of those dollars will flow to the end worker. As we have seen the economic recovery that everyone is talking about still has yet to really become real, we are still seeing people loosing jobs, but at the same time companies are making record profits. So those companies getting the contracts and the people at the top are getting rich but the common person is seeing less and less out of the money being spent however it is their dollar that is being spent to build Iraq back. It comes down to this all of the work has to be done in Iraq so it will employ mainly Iraqis not Americans. So Mr. Bush thanks for the big mess, and thanks for lining the pockets of the corporate crooks that you so prominently promised to clean up and send away, also thanks for this economy in which the rich get richer and the poorwell fuck the poor the rich man doesnt see them behind his large fences.   I cant wait for Bush to be unemployed. It will be a great day when we finally get him and his crooks out of office.  Peace  -------------------------------------------------------------------  There it is folks...enjoy.

      Ok...now I am just perplexed...just saw the Presidential Address to the minions..well here it is folks...  87 BILLION DOLLARS! Muahahaha....Muahahahaha....Muahahahahahahahahahahaha!   With 66 Billion of it going to the pentagon and the war machine.  Ok now don't get me wrong...but didn't we just cut taxes three times now, go to war in Afghanistan (a place where the Russians ultimately lost 500,000 troops), and then set out on a crusade thru the middle east....where is this money going to come from.  Hell he never even said that we would be able to top our gas tanks off for less than a ten spot. Not only is the American public paying lots of taxes (less taxes the richer you get)...but we are also suffering through what can be called at best a dismal economy...and to top it off gasolene and natural gas prices have risen through the roof...so in the end the common man gets it...in the end.  To quickly rattle off a few better uses of 87 Billion dollars...roads, sewage, water supplies, electricity grid, schools, health care, alternative energy research, AIDs Research, bridges, damns, hell even a billion gallon vat of chocolate pudding would be a better use of the money...  I propose that we all tell Bush and his cronnies in Washington to shove it...or get crackin on a huge vat of pudding...cause we need to see something for that 87 Billion dollars.

      Well I think I may be getting out tomorrow...so that would be really nice.   I have gotten Jesse's box in the mail so when I get back home I have work to do which is also great...gives me something to do when I get there and keep my mind off of having to do all the treatments and having to dope myself with Benadryl. I just am not a big fan of drugging myself with that stuff because it does make me really groggy.   Well I am going to get a little surfing out of my system for today...I really think that I am addicted to the internet big time...when I got on for even just a few minutes it was like cocaine for the fingers and the eyes...it was like my addiction came right back hardcore...so yes folks I have found something that I have been able to get addicted to...and that is the internet....heheheh  One good thing is that while I am addicted I don't feel the need to knock over a convenience store to get money to get a fix...because in the end the internet is pretty much free for anyone who seeks it out...because we can still freely access it at out local libraries and even hospitals...so I guess while it is like any other addiction that can ruin lives...the internet is a little different in that at least you don't have to pay a seedy dude to get your fix...  Enough of that for the day...

Assholes get the girls   Jeesh I hope I remembered how to post links...it has been after all a few days since I have done this...oh yeah and I hope to have a few hospital pics to post when I get back as well...I may try to get some of my blog that I have kept posted tomorrow night if I can find a floppy disk to transfer the information over...if not I may be getting out Monday so it won't be to much of a problem.  Anyways peace out my niglets....

Not much else to tell right now...it looks as if Tuesday will be the day that I get my leash put back on...but on the bright side there isn't to much time left to go.  I added the comments feature for peeps to use...it is there to interact with others who read the page and to give me quick input...you can even suggest topics for me to write about.  Well I am going to hit the sac and get some shuteye...till next time!  PLUR

      Well Izzy is finally starting to blow here...I was outside just a few minutes ago and the winds are picking up and it has started to rain a little bit more than what it was earlier.  I love inclement weather. I would really love to go drivin right now...but it is late and I am tired...and I am still on house arrest. Tomorrow I will get to go out and play in it...I have to work a few hours tommorow evening.  I started my mods on my box today and almost (I say almost because I am able to fix it all) screwed it all up. I was trying to make nice curvy windows...but it is very difficult when you just don't have the right tools! Tomorrow when I head out I am stopping by a Wal-Mart to pick up some spray paint...I am going to spray paint the entire thing (with the execption of the front plate) black...that means I have to strip out all the guts and go to work on getting it painted. I already got the shell painted with primer...and it will look nice when I get it all worked out. I also have to stop by a radio shack and pick up some LEDs...preferably blue ones. My next purchase will be a new keyboard mouse combo...wireless of course (I had a set but gave it to Jesse...the Logitech setup with the optical wireless mouse was to slow for gaming) and it will be from Microsoft. I still have to cut the windows from the plexi I have (the first set of windows was an utter failure) and then mount them on the case shell. When I get it all done I will post a few pics of it all. I would also like to do an OC mod to the mobo to get a little more juice out of it. I think it will look good when it is all done.  Maybe this  keyboard-mouse combo  if I can find it.  Well it is late and I have to get up for the nurse in the morning...she is replacing my port needle...that is gonna hurt a little, but it is time this set has been in for a couple of weeks.  PLUR  Oh and isn't it interesting that Clark is now a candidate...jeesh.

      It looks as if Blogger has fixed the coding problem they had and now my entire page can be viewed...a big ups to them.  So maybe we won't see anymore problems with the page...also I need to get my counter fixed so that it tracks multiple pages and doesn't register each page view of the archives as a new hit...so that will be a task for later today.

      Today I actually got a decent amount of things done...  First was the big bang of the day. I went to the doctor to see how I am doing...and as expected and told in the numbers I am getting better but I am not completely healthy yet. The way I described it to the doc he was amazed to see it in the numbers. So it was an eye-opener for him that I don't really complain that much and when I say I am sick or well that they should listen even more closely because my description was dead on.  One good thing came out of the appointment. I have gained an amazing six pounds...so now I am back to around 121-122 pounds...I need to gain more thought, but it is a start.  I got my oil changed today in my poor car...it was way overdue in both miles and time. That was good and while I was there I met some pretty and nice female...unfortunately she is currently in a relationship or I would have humped her right then and there...she was cute. Interesting thing is she is a MRI tech at the hospital I go to often.  While I was there at Wal-Mart I was able to get the tools I need to mod my box. That is certainly kewlio...then I had to go to a hardware store to pick up the correct screws so I could mount the mods. All the equipment came to about 35 bucks...not to bad plus I have the drill bits for another project that my grandmother wants me to do...she wants to have some plexi cut and put into a China Cabinet to keep the dust from accumulating on the china pieces...so I will be able to do that now.  I also went to get my prescriptions filled. If I would have had to pay for my meds they would have easily added up to over a grand. Speaking of health care costs I got my bill for my recent hospital stay. It was over 60,000 dollars! With about 30,000 grand going into medication! Fortunately for me my various state and federal insurance packages cover the entire bill...thank you to all the taxpayers out there. Because of your sacrifices in tax money you are keeping me alive with your money. Thank you a lot!  Well I don't know what else there is to tell. Tomorrow I will start my mod project...hopefully I will have pics of it if I can complete it tomorrow...  Till then....PLUR

      Today I slept in late...when I got up I worked on Jesse's computer a little more. Got it a hell of a lot more tweaked out now. It is still registering some stuff that isn't right...but I guess that is what you get when you tweak the hell out of it.  The video card doesn't recognize as the right model...but it is recognized by games and benchmarks correctly so it really isn't a problem. It runs fast as ballz too so that is a plus. I found out the the FX5600 cards are actually slower than the card series they were ment to replace...so I tweaked it out with a custom BIOS and now it runs faster and harder than before...so I made up the speed difference in tweaks. Downside it doesn't recognize as the correct card to Windows XP...a little odd but hey all the features of the card do work as far as I have seen. Also the processor is still registering as something else...but hey it is running at stock speed like it should. I was hoping that I could overclock it like I was able to with my chip...but the chip we got is really finnicky and just causes errors anytime you bump even a little over the rated speed...but again it runs properly so as long as it does what it is supposed to do I don't have a problem with it.  When I first set it up Windows Setup wasn't able to recognize the full 200gig drive and would allow me to only partition out 136gigs of it...but if you plug the drives into a system that is already running and format them from within Windows it recognizes the entire drive and lets you format it without having to split them into partitions...so that is what I did...I basically merged the partitions and now he has two big ass drives instead of a 136gig, 64gig, and 200gig drive...they now both show as 200gig single partition drives instead of one being split into two partitions...so that was kewlio.  Now all that is left is for me to match the faceplate up with color of the system...I may change the faceplate altogether to get a better look...but that will have to wait until I take a look at it tomorrow...after I get back from the hospital (I have an appointment).  Well not a lot happened outside of that...I am planning to mod my box and add windows to it...I got some plexy and now all I have to do is get a couple of cutters, some torx screws (to match how the faceplate is connected), then cut out the windows and tap a few screw holes for the plexi...I am doing it commando style...forget about laying the window into the metal...I am going to lay it over the top of the hole and secure it down with torx screws...plus with the limited space on the inside of the box actually trying to lay the plastic inside (or inlayed with the metal in the traditional method) it just wont work...I also have an idea of adding a LED lights to light the inside of the case...and perhaps lay an LED into the plexi to make it light at the edges...I would work with of coarse blue and red LEDs. I can't get a cold cathode tube into it (again size is a factor) so I will guerilla style it...also I would add additional cooling holes because my little box is tweaked close to the max so it gets warm (I may add another fan somewhere inside it...depending on what happens). I have a few ideas floating in my head that may get tried out...inluding some wirewrap to tie up a few loose wires.  Well I am fairly tired and I need some sleep. Peace...

      Went to work today...not a lot to tell...I am sooo tired from the past few days and now I am starting to get itchy from my meds...I upped my Benadryl dose and it makes me twitchy...almost like I felt before I had a seizure...  I am just worn thin from the past couple of days...especially with my patience...it is truly a virtue and this one whore who is "the guru" of mall kiosks almost got an earfull of hateful words that nearly came spilling out today.  If I have to see that old, fat, retarded, foolish, cow one more time I will snap...I will. She just needs to go away and die!  I will elaborate when I have more energy and when I am not so doped up on benadryl...because right now just about everything is a blur.  Peace

      I have not been able to get the video digitized onto the computer yet...but rest assured once I have the time I will do it and find some place to host it...the video raises great questions that should be being asked by everyone in the Nation.  I was happy today because I recieved an email from one of my favorite "quirky" bands called Automusik. They are based out of Memphis. I first saw them about a year and a half ago at a show where they were the openers for The Cory Feldman band whatever it is called...their show rocked ass and really it was quite amusing and different. Almost like Devo on crack with much the same sound and idea with it being really a quirky A/V experience that you have to see as well as hear.  They were nice enough to send me a link to where a recording and pics from some of their concerts is located. So here it is...click the link and experience  Automusik !  Well I am tired and I have to work tomorrow so I am going to get some rest...also of note I got Jesse's box up and running so that is a good thing...it is fast as ballz.  PLUR

      I wish that I were healthier...because I would join the military in a heartbeat.  You hear me talk a lot that this war isn't just and that we shouldn't be there...and I firmly believe that with my whole heart. However that does not relieve me of the great pride that I feel for our troops and the great sorrow that I feel for them as it seems that they will be over there for a long time.   I am one of those people that is not affected easily. Meaning things can happen around me, bad things and I don't mind. Seeing terrible things does not bother me nor would it as far as I have been led to believe with my extremely warped mind. I have killed animals (hunting and poaching dogs and cats that were eating our livestock in truely brutal ways yet never felt even the slightest bit of pain or remourse....) I am one of that rare breed that comes along that would see it as my duty, whether right or wrong, to serve my country even if the actions aren't just....as long as I was not serving in a capacity that would bring me into conflict with US Citizens...as the US Military Forces are never to be used against the public in any way...which is why Waco pisses me off as well as Ruby Ridge...not in a mad wanna bomb something way...but in the way "why did the officers accept the orders to deploy against US citizens even if they were breaking the law"...that is what I am pissed about...law enforcement should have handled it. Not the military.  But that brings me back to my main point. If I could I would serve as a front line troop now. I would sign up. Learn the language (at least functionally enough to get by) and go and show the Iraqi people that there are decent folks here in the US that think it is wrong...but at the same time treat them with respect...we are hearing more and more stories come out that individual units are turning over control to Iraqi's even though it is against the edicts handed down...but these commanders and troops are taking the point and making things better...in a humane way...instead of the Bush policy of degradation of the people and steal their resourses....  I would love to be there. I would love to be part of history...I would love to be with some of the best Americans that we have. They put their asses on the line for us whether we like it or not. Even if the action they are in is just or isn't...they are still out there with their balls on the line...and for that they deserve the ultimate respect...and the best way that we can show our respect is to do this....  Bring our sons and daughters, sisters, brothers, mothers, and fathers home...now!   More Troops will be needed regardless of what Cheney and Bush think.

      Well I have one more evening with my PC...on Sunday morning I have to rip the ram out and send it on its way to be returned so they can send me a new pair...I am just glad that I have a lifetime waranty...that is lucky ducky for me little rubber mucky...ok enough rhyming for tonight  I am just glad this week is almost over...I look forward to another week...as that will be the first week that I haven't had a needle in my chest...yay! However sad to say folks it looks as though I will have to get it shoved back in before to long.   Literally I have been ok over the past few weeks since coming home. I have had a minor cough but nothing productive at all. The maybe four hours after having the port de-acessed, after having not being able to bring anything up for two weeks, I started coughing blood...blood for christs sake...jesus h mary baby jesus fetus christ...out of no where blood! Believe in a higher power I do...I believe that he/she/it fucking hates my guts...and hey no love lost there buddy...hell you smote Joel in the old testament...killed his family and took away all that he had...all because you are a prick.  Anyways enough of my daily cursing of christ...I am going to get some rest...damning god to hell tuckers me out...  Peace all...

      Today I got to see the Democratic nominees debate...well I wasn't so impressed with it all. Maybe I wanted something more. I think it is because of the full ticket that they have that none can really get a word in edge wise...that is probably why I wasn't so impressed.  I will say that out of all the candidates there the most charasmatic was by far Al Sharpton...whom I despise utterly. First he should be running on the "Snowballs Chance in Hell" ticket...but he does bring something that is seriously lacking in all aspects of public service. Character...plain simple character. I love when I see real people...not some stuffed suit. I want someone who is at least from the human species as my leader.  Lieberman is just a lost cause. He needs to go ahead and drop out now and just endorse someone else. He really is just there as stage filler it looks like. It is really sad that a man can be that boring. Just listening to him made me want to go put on some Nirvana and kill myself.  Kerry is scary looking. I think it is because his head looks like a rectangle...did they torture him in Vietnam by sqeezing his head into a cardboard box or something. Again he is just another stuffed shirt up there.  We have Moseley Braun. Another one that should really just get out of it...not because I don't think a woman or a black woman could win...but she has yet to bring up any real issues and take to task what is going on in this nation. She is wanting to wage a war for womens lib...when that war has already been fought and mostly won. If she had something more to say I would listen...but so far her running is her running because of her ego.  Gephardt...this is the candidate that the Dems would love to win...either him or Kerry...because they are both part of the Washington crowd...I will make a comment on that in a minute. This guy really needs to come up with something better than saying Dean is like Gingrich...(in some circles that is an honor)...also he has played "the miserable failure" line a little too long...once hey it worked...twice ehhh ok we'll aplaud..any more and we're gonna drag ya out back and beat ya with a dictionary so you may get some new words in you vocabulary.  Kucinich...call me crazy but that little dude has a real bug up his ass...and he actually had a good answer to "what would be the most unpopular thing you would persue in your presidency"...his answer was cutting the military and forcing it to be more efficient...then taking that money and putting it into education. The rest of the field had answers but most centered around repealing the tax cuts. I like this little guy because he is more of a Democrat than the rest...not that I am particularly fond of Democrats...but at least his view is strong and towards the left...he doesn't seem to want to bend on changing the way money is spent and fixing the environment.  Graham in short is an old fart that just needs to retire to his state...go head out and lounge around the pool with the rest of Florida...I don't want an old man running what has become a world in which you have to think fast and be at least somewhat up to date with your thinking...we need solutions not "well this is the way we did it"...the way you did it wasn't all that effective the first time around or we wouldn't be facing the same problems you jackasses put together for us now. So in short....piss off.  This leaves us with three remaining candidates. Clark, Dean, and Edwards.  Clark: First of all I am not impressed all that much by him up to this point simply because he has wavered back and forth on things. I understand the world is not black and white...but sometimes just go ahead and make a stand and take your lumps like a man. If I close my eyes when he is speaking I hear Bush in many respects (at least he sounds like him)...I would hope that people will see through the curtain and just see that the Clintons are propping him up as a way for Hilary to run for VP...with no real chance of winning in 04' and then setting her up for a strong run in 08'. I can see if he gets the nod that the Dems won't run him hard and if he pics Hilary there would be somewhat of a backlash...as she is not the most pleasant person. Her softer makeover hasn't taken complete effect yet (just think Tankles). If they don't run him hard then she will be set up for almost an assured shoe in as the Dem nominee for 08' and possibly the Presidency...I will get to her in a few minutes.  I just want for Clark to stand on his own and fight the battles...I would love for him to run on a ticket with Dean...a Dean-Clark or Clark-Dean ticket would be unstopable period.  Dean: I was slightly dissapointed in his performance today...not because he did anything wrong...but that he wasn't as animated as I have seen him in some of his personal appearances that he has made round the country. I want to see the man that takes off the jacket and loosens the tie and gets down to brass tax...I want to see that he isn't polished...that he is a man not a politician even though he is a politician. He did very well deflecting the blows that came his way from other hopefuls in that he didn't really attack them when they came after him...he told they were wrong and then tried to focus them back onto the bigger issue of getting Bush out of office...very grown up of him...a quality that is sorely needed when it comes to politics...because right now you see on the world stage politicians acting like children yet in the meantime we have our men and women dieing in Iraq...  He needs a little more in the way of tacking down some of his policies and he will be golden...yes we need to repeal those tax cuts...but what money will that bring in...and then what will you do with that money. How much do you think it will cost to give us all healthcare....etc...get those numbers together and show us how it will be paid for and then more people will take this movement as more than a movement and more of a real thing.  Edwards: Why do I put him in this group when Kerry or Gephardt would be better as front runners. Well because I like him. He kept a promise and officially anounced his candidacy on The Daily Show with John Stewart.   Keeping a promise...even as mundane as that is a pretty big thing. So he got extra credit for that. He really doesn't have a shot in this field right now...but his ideas are sound and he is charasmatic. He is a young guy that can have the pull with younger voters if he can get across to them.   He will be one to watch in a few years...just a little more under his belt and he may become a good leader in the party.   Now on the Hilary question. She has already promised that she wouldn't run for President in 04'. Which I take her at her word (even though I shouldn't). However she has not said that she wouldn't stump for VP in 04'. Now she has stated that she wants to make a run for President in 08'. Now the numbers don't quite work out here. If she gets the nod for VP this year then one of three things will happen...with one only really being a possibility.   First the two out there scenarios. The first is her and running mate win the election. Once in there would be a tragic assasination. She would be in the number one spot. The second is that her running mate makes it all the way through but decides not to run for a second term (it happens but rarely).  The other scenario which is very plausible is this. That her and running mate X run a poor campaign and don't go at it hard and loose to Bushco. In 08' the Republicans won't have a good candidate for Pres...come on Cheney (my ass)...and she would have a relatively easy time of a campaign because of another four years of Bushco in charge...by then even hard core hillbilly republicans will be crying for anything different.  I want a woman to win the office I really do...but I don't want her specifically. I don't think she would be a good one...I would have to see how she talks and see some more of her ideas...also see if she has changed some of her views. Then maybe I would vote for her...but if it were today I wouldn't.  Coming to my last point of the evening or this post is this. I am tired of seeing stuffed shirts. I want someone who is entertaining. I want my candidate to be human in every way...hey if the F-bomb were dropped every once in a while like in this context "what the fuck was he thinking? Come on people!"...I think that could be tolerated today. I don't want our politicians to be potty mouths...but in real life people swear...they should too and not be ashamed of it. That shows they are human and prone to slipups...also sometimes those words are really the best to describe some things.  I want to see my candidate in jeans and a decent shirt...just like I dress in my day to day life. I don't want them to make me feel inferior because I can't afford a 2100 dollar suit. Hell go to a debate in that for all I care...actually do that because then it shows that the pomp and circumstance is just that...it has nothing to do with the issues...hell wear PJ's and bunny slippers...but for God's sake just be a real person.  Scripting is great...if you are an actor (Ahnold) but not if your a politician. If you are truely informed you should be able to give a speach about things. Sure you write down some notes...but damn if you can't take a few questions and answer them (without having known what they were before hand...no more of this scripted Q&A sessions bullshit) without the aid of a teleprompter or hours of preperation...then you certainly haven't been doing your job. If it is something that you don't know...it isn't a crime to say I don't know the answer to that...I will get back to you on it (and then in a novel idea...call the reporter or person who asked you the question after you have researched it and give them the answer...that would endear you to the people as a person that takes time to listen and then think).  Ok...I am tired and it is late...I need some sleep!  PLUR  Oh yeah later today I have to take my box offline to send back my RAM kit that is bad...it will be down I would imagine through to the beggining of next week...I will still update..but I don't know how good they will be :-)

      Ok so I had to change my counters around a bit....over there they represent the data a little better and the peace hippie thing is actually a counter that ya'll can take a look at...gives a break down of the info...  Enjoy and maybe this will help straighten some of the conflicting numbers I have been getting...jeesh  The first one just counts how many total visits to the site...the second counter actually keeps a little better track of who, where, when...but it doesn't display on my main page the number of people that have visited and it won't let me start it at the number that I have gotten too...if I can figure that out then I will use it exclusively...but till then...blah!

      I recieved an email from the makers of my ram today and they are going to replace it for me. I am glad they have a lifetime warranty on them. Actually they couldn't have been more helpfull about it all. The just gave me an RMA number and said send in the pair and we'll get you a new set sent out. So far it looks painless. The only problem is that I will have to not be on the computer for a couple of days...but I can handle that. Also it means that I have to use my laptop for those few days.   As I think more and more about what I want to get next when I get some money for computer stuff. I think I am going to upgrade and get a new laptop...actually a desktop replacement laptop. They are larger and heavier than the smaller and thinner ones...but they come with top of the line components and run right in line with desktop PCs.  I would get something along this line. A laptop from  Powernotebooks .  Something like that would do...I will wait and see what other notbooks come out with the ATi Mobility 9600 because that is the biggie right there. To have that piece of hardware in your laptop means that you have the high end of graphics that will be very good for gaming on the go. The rest of the computer is almost irrelevant...I would love to find a Centrino Based system that has the 9600 in and 1GB of RAM as well as a 5400RPM drive...but if I cant find it I would head to Powernotebooks to get going...as they have had great reviews and are the cutting edge of technology without being way out expensive.   This is the same company that supplies notebooks for  Alienware . With the one exception...Alienware goes with the Geforce FX 5600GO video chipset in it which is far inferiour to the ATi chipset.  It will all depend on getting some money russled together here soon. I would like to try and get my act together and have something by Christmas...that would be soooo K-RAD!  Well I am off to get a bit of sleep...I get the needle taken out of my chest tomorrow which makes me a happy boy...and I also completed the final work on the computer case...now all I have to do is add the few BLUE LEDs to the inside of the case to light it up a bit...overall it looks ok...I can see that while I am waiting for the RAM to be returned I am going to dissasemble it again and sand it down a bit and paint it with a flat black paint solution instead of the somewhat shiny gloss black I have on it...the sanding will be a bitch...but then again I don't have much to do...so I might as well make it look really good...  Well off to bed!   Peace....and keep an eye on the cost of war to the right over there...the American Taxpayers dollars at work and not getting us anything for it all...and OPEC just announced that it was going to cut back by 900 thousand (I think that is right) barrels a day to bring the prices up slightly more...so as you can see...we have invaded an oil rich nation...we are paying american corporations to go in and fic it up (on the taxpayers tab) they then sell the oil to themselves...and pass along higher gas prices to us in the end...so we are paying for Iraqii oil in taxes to rebuild the industry (which mind you the industry has plenty of money to build it up without having to ask for a dollar as they will make money on it which ever way they go)...then the consumer pays again at the pump because OPEC has decided to create another shortage as they did in the late 70's.  Oh yeah one more thing...since we legally became the owners/operators/occupiers of Iraq we have under international law assumed all of the debt that the Iraqi government accrued over its years of operations...which is in the 200 Billion dollar range...that debt is now on the American taxpayer...also any and all contracts that were signed under the old regime still have to be honored because the contracts were for the Iraqi people...so really Bechtell and Halliburton shouldn't even be involved in the oil fields because Russian and French contractors had already signed contracts to do the work on the systems...  Part of the gripe about all of this was that when America was going to go in they would attempt to void all debt and contracts...but under current international law the American leadership can't do that...so it will be interesting to see how this plays out over the next few months...because a lot of these lendors and contractors haven't been paid yet...and they have legal claim to it all...  So in the end 87 Billion (which in reality only about 20 Billion goes towards rebuilding the rest is for military operations and upgrades) and the current totals that have been spent (around 76 Billion with about 10 billion going towards rebuilding if even that much and the rest to the military to wage the war) we could be looking at having to pay the 200 billion dollars worth of debt that is owed to the Russians (they sold them weapons and heavy equipment), the French (they sold them oild field technology among other things), and have to live up to contracts that are worth billions more with the likes of BP/Shell oil and many others...so it could cost us over 500 billion when all is said and done...and when we do leave it will only take one election and the entire state will be what we certainly wouldn't want...a fundamentalist Muslim state.  Wow...just think folks...while the threat of terror weighs heavily on our minds...and we have an urational fear of it really (considered to what people think around the world)...we have set ourselves up as the main target for some truely bad things that maybe we should be scared of...  Leave it to some idiots to fuck up the world for us...and this time the idiots are from Texas...and they run under the newly NYSE company name of Bushco (not really...but when they get there 250 million for a campaign they will be a rather large company).  BLAH!!!!

      Check out the added feature on the sidebar...it is a cost of war tally...and if you go to the website it shows you the cost in perspective to things here at home...like housing, or teachers, or health care...and they tell you how they get their numbers. Sure looks to me that this thing is going to cost way more than 80 billion plus over the next year...  That is really insane considering that here at home people are starving and homeless, children at all levels of primary education are deficiant in many of the basic skills, that 25 million or so children have no health care, and numerous other things are in the shitter...  Vote no on anymore money to Iraq...tell the administration to speed up the building of a government...tell them to make the money that will be spent into a loan...tell them to bring the troops home and spend the money here.

      I am convinced now that someone who is in power hates me...hates my guts. I just had a stick of RAM go bad! I wrote the company that made the RAM because it has a lifetime warranty on it and the place where I got it reffered me to them so hopefully they will make good on the warranty.  Jeesh just as things might have started to look up. This has to come and smack me in the nose. Not to mention all of the other shit that we are all having to deal with in the family.  Oh yeah and an update on my grandpa...it seems he has a bad staph infection...yup good ole staph...the real problem that I see is that he has massive kidney failure and his liver isn't in the best shape and all of the good drugs that could be used to fight it off would be very damaging to both those organs...so what are they gonna do? I wonder.  I guess it really doesn't matter in the end because he is pretty dieing anyway...and the sooner the better because there is nothing worse than having a sick family member linger on for a long time...it is easier to deal with when the person just dies because then you don't have to deal with the illness day in and day out...because for anyone to deal with that it eventually fosters some feelings of disdain. I say that especially in this case because he was never a good man to my grandmother or mother for that matter and since my mom moved up here to be there just in case he has really taken advantage of her.  She moved up under the impression that things financially were ok and that he had all of it arranged so that if he did get sick or go and die suddenly it would be relatively painless to figure out what he owes and pay it off and then distribute any assets as he wanted...well that wasn't the case. Instead she came up to a mess and when she got things in order they also took out extra money against the house to have a cushion for a bit if things got messy...well instead of not touching that money he has basically spent a good chunk of it and we don't know were he spent it.  We really aren't talking about that much money in the grand scheme of things...but it still is a burden because if he does live for another year or two my mom will end up having to pay all the bills because he won't have the money or manage what money he does get from Social Security in any sensible way.  He gets about 700 a month from the government. That would be enough under the way she got everything consolidated to pay the majority of the bills. However he cashes that check for running round money and has taken out of the account additional money to do god knows what with it. The only thing that she is asking him to pay is the morgage on the house...she is taking care of the utilities and such. She then finds out just in the last week that he had some bills outstanding from his business that are basically leveraged against his property...the amount is only about 500 dollars...but still it hasn't been paid and instead of paying that bill when he got extra money after refinancing he just ignored it. So she has to straighten that out...and god only knows what else will crop up.  In addition to all that he is just a piss ant and really is one of those people that you would not want to know. He has alienated all of his family (it is a miracle that he has two people in his life that don't really care as my mom and I don't really let bad behaviour get in the way of family) and he has no real friends per se.  It baffles me really. I have been irresponsible with money for a good part of my life. I have never really been good at budgeting but after having seen this and other cases in which people live way beyond their means I am glad that I have started to live within mine and have seriously curbed my ways (which I have my grandmother and mother to thank for that at this point)...  Right now I get 530 bucks from the government every month to live on. I have only four bills per month at this point. I have a car note that is 230 bucks...I wish that I didn't have that but I needed a car and in reality it isn't that bad considering the car I got is a luxury car (a 1998 Oldsmobile Aurora...I got it for a song and a dance and it is helping rebuild my shitty credit)...I have a cell phone which eats about 50 bucks a month if I stay off of it during the day (which is why I rarely use it during the week before 9PM because I only have 300 minutes on peak and unlimited off peak and weekend minutes...plus I have unlimited PCS Vision internet on it). I have to give back to the government 53 bucks a month for fines and then I give my grandmother money each month to help offset some of the bills that I encure as well as pay on the credit card I have that she gave me...total I owe about 300 on it...and I try not to buy anything on it except gas...I do however owe for the camera I got on it which is 300 bucks but that is a business expense that I will be able to make back hopefully...I also owe her more than that but she is good to me and you won't ever hear me complain that I don't have nice things because she has done so much for me...so in a given month I have maybe 100 bucks of spending money which right now is limited because I am on house arrest...so in the end I might have some money saved up.  I just got a job that will bring in I hope about 300 a month...which hey that would be great because I can pay my grandmother off and not have to worry about the credit card getting out of hand. Oh I forgot I spent 80 bucks the other day on an oil change and a couple of bits of stuff for my case mod...but that I will give her this next month...usually I giver her about 125 to 150 a month depending.  Here is my point. I am going to try my damndest to not get into a situation anytime soon that makes it hard for me to pay my bills...I know that when my grandmother passes away (if she goes before I do) that I will have to make big changes in my already low budget lifestyle and will have to reduce costs as well as find something that will bring more money in.  I had wanted to move away after I got done with this house arrest but at this point I don't think that I can afford it. I don't have the income to go moving off anywhere yet. With my illness it is also hard to get a regular job seeing that at anytime I could end up in the hospital and have no income whatsoever...because of the rules if I get a good paying job I loose even my little check from the goverment...and to qualify to get it again I would have to go a year without income..and if I have bills I can't do that and live somewhere else...you see the math doesn't add up. I would have to have thousands in the bank and if I have that I might not qualify to get aid as well.  The idea that is currently floating around the family is this. My grandmother is taking a hit in the stock market right now. Her portfolio is shrinking because of the stock markets spotty performance. So she is thinking of taking some of that money out now and putting it into property. She wants to help finance a house for my mom and I.  Now I have really mixed feelings about this all. It comes down to two things. First and foremost I wouldn't want to burden my grandmother with that even though I would qualify for section 8 housing and they would basically pay the mortgage payment for me...well rent to my grandmother which in turn would pay the mortgage...or if we got the loan with me as a co-owner it would be paid for me...  Second problem is that I don't really want to live with my mom. I love my mother greatly but I don't know if I could live with her again. I am no clean freak, and I am not one to cast stones...but we are really two different people. I am messy and unorganized...she is dirty and unorganized. Two very different things. I try and keep things clean where as she hasn't ever been into keeping things clean...and minor things like leaving butter out. Small things yes...but also I am 26 years old and I live with my grandmother and then would be living with my mother. I am already a pathetic person but I don't want to move in with her and jeapordize the good relationship we have. In addition I would also feel even worse than I already do because it would be her supporting much to much.   I already am torn in the situation I am in now...I don't really contribute a substantial amount to my own upkeep...I don't know folks...I just wish I had a bunch of money because I could then just say this is how I want to do it.   I would buy a little loft on the outskirts of Pittsburgh and have spartan but nice furnishings from Ikea and one of their kick ass beds, a simple sofa set, a nice entertainment area with a few nice toys to say...a nicely equiped kitchen that is spotless and has nice cookware (because I do love to cook if I have all the tools and nice cookware to work with)...and that would be all I need...all of it would be open space because I like that concept of a one room living space that is open. One side would be the bedroom area and the other would be the living area, and another area the kitchen dining area...with minimal walls sectioning it all off...more like fake walls to give some privacy but not completely closed off. Basically you would be able to see the entire space from any point in the place...with the exception of the bathroom...that has to be closed up somewhat...it would be an ideal living working space for me. Partly because I am a nerd and need to have all the toys together to get them all working in concert with each other. The entertainment setup would consist of a Plasma TV from Gateway and a computer hooked up to it with big flat panel connected to the computer for work and the plasma screen for playing video and TV and games on...all run through a speaker system that puts out a lot of sound run out of the computer...it would be a convergance dream in which I could make it do things like display art on the Plasma screen for kicks and get togethers...and play visualizations for winamp when playing music...and double as the gaming screen...but the main flat panel would be big and work for gaming on the computer side of things...nice appliances but nothing special...just a nice trendy but spartan environment designed for modern efficient living.  That is my dream place to habitate in.  It really isn't much to ask for...and I would love to be able to have a job that would allow me to do this...which I am working on. I have stuff to sell on Ebay that would get my mom money but also get me some seed money to get the things to put together this dream...also I have seen a few jobs that I can actually qualify for without a degree but would probably pay well enough to live like that...but get to that level over time.  Hey maybe in that environment I could even afford to have someone in my life that would want to be around me.   And that my friend is what I want the most. I want someone who is of the opposite sex who would want to be loved and would love me. Someone who will understand that I am really a very complicated yet shallow emotionally person (shallow in emotion because I feel that emotions complicate things in an irrational way...as I don't respond emotionally in a normal way to things)...someone who will feed my intellectual side yet be able to be dumb at the same time...so that when I don't have earth shatering things to say will be alright if I make farting noises with my mouth. Whether or not that person exists is highly debatable.  Most of all that person has to be willing to force change on me in the right way...and someone who will be willing to loose me and at the same time assure me that loosing me won't kill their soul. That has been my biggest stumbling block to date for me to be close to anyone...becuase of emotion. In my knowledge and critical thought I have come to the conclusion that I don't want to inflict pain on anyone when I go...I want it to be celebrated as I would celebrate their life if they were to pass. I would mourn my passing but I would also know of be assured that in my passing that I as a person had something that I enjoyed and loved and would want to go on...  Such deep thought is always hard...and yet I am always compelled to think this way. It is a blessing and curse. It is the problem with having a brain that is always going a million miles an hour thinking in so many branches and working every angle...trying to find the best solution to a problem that has no solution. It is a curse because I always come to the conclusion that I can't have those things based on past experience.  What I fear most is that no one will come along to proove me wrong...and that is what I desperately want. Someone to proove me wrong.  Yet after having written this I could ramble on for another twenty hours because my brain has kicked in again and is analysing every word as I write it...  Please someone respond to this...someone proove me wrong.

      So finaly this week of sheer hell is over for me now.  Lets start by saying that I really don't like the job I am doing because it is just such BS. This Kiosk that I work at sells ritzy pet things...all of it way overpriced and nothing that I personally would ever buy...but people do buy it. Yesterday I sold 33 dollars worth of stuff from 11AM to 6PM...today was even better...I sold 0.00 from 10AM to 5PM. I can tell that the woman who is going in on this is dissapointed that I am not selling more...or rather that I am not pushing people into sales. My simple philosophy is this...you either want it or you don't. I really can't make you mind up for you in the end. So my schtick is this. I walk up to the customer...but I don't interfere with their personal bubble (because I hate when people do that to me when I am in stores) I say "Hello...how are you today"...they say a few words back and I usually reply with "Oh things are good...if you need anything I will be here to answer questions for you." Then I leave them pretty much alone unless they engage me in a conversation which has happened a few times. I have a no pressure approach because of my philosphy...you'll either want it or not...I can't take your wallet out and make the purchase for you.  Couple that with prices that are really to high (and she went back and raised a few prices during the week) and you have for slow days. It really isn't the holidays yet and that is when we hope it will get busy.  In the end she really can't afford me to just stand there with a goofy look on my face...and frankly I feel bad because this is supposed to be a vehicle to help get some of her debt paid down.   Here are the numbers. 5500 for the Kiosk through Christmas (I don't know if it is per month or a lump sum). Her inventory which she paid wholesale through a middle man when she could have gotten it much cheaper from the factories...and that is going to kill her there.  Plus she has me who comes in for two days a week...a total of 16 hours at what she wants to pay me (8 bucks an hour) and she also has another person who is working for her and I would imagine she has a similar deal too. Well all that adds up and she may not make it back...hell she will be lucky to break even in the end.  She has left it "up to GOD"...and we all know that he hasn't been a real good manager.  Hell his churches blow through money left and right and are constantly begging for more.  So that is that story.  Also in this hell week my grandfather has gotten really ill. Now I am of the impression he will die real soon because he is pretty bad from what I here. I haven't been to visit him yet in the hospital. My mom came home one evening and found him collapsed on the kitchen floor. Not but a few days earlier he was backing out of his driveway and backed into a parked truck. He has been on a rapid decline over the past few weeks. He is on Dialisys and from everything I have heard you get a max of five years on that and then people die off like flies after that...and you only get to that point if you take excellent care of yourself.   Well back to the colapse. First thing you do is call the ambulance right? Well my mom has never once in her life made a sound health choice regardless of who she was having to make a decision for. I went for over a week one time with a bowel blockage when I was younger even though I knew something was wrong...but she wouldn't take me until it got to the point where I couldn't stand...even then she resented the fact that she had to take me to a doctor. Also when I was younger I never got the proper drug treatments ever...and that could have helped me now...partly because of her...partly because my dad wouldn't spend the money on the drugs (and this was before they had the really expensive stuff)...she never contacted state agencies to see if I qualified for some assistance or anything. She is just horrible when it comes to medical stuff. When my sister was in a severe wreck my mom talked her out of going to the hospital in the ambulance...turned out my sister did need to go. When it came round to getting money for the accident (it was someone else's fault) because she hadn't taken the ride she lost out on a substantial amount of money (like 50 grand or more).  So when she found him collapsed she first tried to administer aid herself. Got him up to his room because he wanted to pee. Then she finally got around to calling his PCP. Now what were they gonna say "give him an aspirin"...no they said to call the ambulance immediately. So she finally did more than an hour after she found him on the floor. Compounding all of this was a fever that was rising and eventually is topping out (he still has it) at 104F.   She said he was very jaundice (yellow skin tone) and that is a sign that things aren't working right. With his bad kidneys it is probably cause by that because once they shut down other things shut down as well like the liver. He is essentially having organ failures...and on top of it he has a heart condition...smokes, drinks, doesn't eat right the whole nine yards...so I told her that she has always made bad decisions when it comes to health and just listen to me on this one...I ended up being right.  She got upset when I told her that...and it may have hurt her feelings...but I said it because it was the truth and in this situation she could face charges if she didn't act properly...and she didn't. She flat out didn't. Fortunately her ass is covered now...he excuse was that she needed to get the PCP to get things arranged so he could go strait in...well ER have doctors too and they would be just as well versed with medical conditions...and they could have called his PCP to get full details.  On top of it all she has had Jesse's box to send back to him...in all the rush and hub-ub she forgot about it which I can understand that...she is able to get a big ass discount on sending it through Fed-Ex so she said she would get it in to them in the morning and have it delivered overnight service...she was going to try today but got detained at the hospital with all this shit.  Heres the kick in the balls...my lung infection is not over...and I know as soon as I stop the meds on Wednesday within two weeks tops I will be back in the hospital...because these bugs I have are just not responding to the meds they have me on...  Sometimes I just want to say fuck it all and quit.  What I have felt for a long time and my friend Danielle (who is also a CF patient) elloquently said..."We are so old yet so young. It is a crime."  That is what it is alright. A crime. I have friends who are out there and in relative health yet they complain about meaningless bullshit...oh my back hurts, I have this ailment, or that one...shut the fuck up people.  You aren't sick. You haven't even begun to experience what some unfortunate people have had to deal with. For the older folks out there...I understand that it is a bummer to start to have your health fail knowing that sooner or later you are going to die...but you have lived a full life. Those of us who are young and have to deal with all this shit seem to have a much better grasp on it and accept what will come of us.   I would never wish this on anyone...but if some people could walk a day in my shoes to see they shit I have to do...and when that shit stops working is when you truely become fucked...and for me things are no longer working.  Before I exit this planet I hope to make a difference...I want to write a couple of papers...and maybe a book. I have material that I have scribbled all over the place and in that material I am sure is some great stories and possibly some interesting ideas.  I just can hope that I can realize some of the things in my head before they die with me.  Oh and I figured out what I want done with my body when I die...first I want it to be a research corpse...something so students can disect me and play with my guts...but then I want to be cremated and then have the ashes taken to one of the new labs that can take a persons ashes and turn them into diamonds. So that is what I want done with me. I want to become eternal...and what better way than through a diamond. In addition I want to have some genetic samples drawn and preserved (preferrably encased in the diamond or the ring that will hold the diamond) so that maybe in a future time they will be able to clone me...at least it will be a historical record that will say to someone in the distant future...he lies Michael Honse in stone, DNA attached for reference.

      Well today I had my first full day of work...I can tell you now with all honesty that the business this woman is running will fail. The market just isn't there and she pays way to much for everything causing her to jack her prices up to a point where things are just unreasonable.  I hope for her sake that thing will pick up and that we can sell the hell out of the items she has...its not that the items in and of themselves are crappy...they are just to expensive in this economy. You see this lady is in deep debt and she thought it might be good to start her own business. Now for me I would have chosen to go into something that lands contracts so you have some sense of security as to what you are working for and selling. You can then build in profit from the beginning and you only need to get what you need and not carry any type of stock. This thing is costing way to much money and frankly it probably won't even return her investment...all she could really hope is to break even...and that might be a stretch. She has left it in "GODs" hands...and well you know that I don't particularly put much faith in an entity that has been corrupted by man.  One thing about this job and I really noticed it today is that the mall is just a place of absolute absurdity. You have maybe four or five major types of things sold in a mall...the main thing being clothes. Well all the stores sell pretty much the same thing at huge markups considering all their clothes are made in third world countries for pennies and people here plop down 50 bucks for a pair of jeans...it is just mind boggling to me.  I watched people aimlessly amble by with these blank looks on their faces like they had been put into a trance and were consuming for the sake of consumption. I saw teens walking around with bags and bags of stuff with a cell phone attached to their head talking way to loudly and about such meaningless things.   When I get done at the end of the day I feel dirty...I literaly walk out of that mall and feel like I have just been through some sort of evil ritual that Americans call commerce.   My philosophy is simple...I need maybe 7-10 pairs of pants and a couple pair of "dress up" pants, about a dozen shirts or so, a few hoodies or sweatshirts, and maybe a few button down shirts...all of that would add up to maybe 300 dollars worth of goods. That is all I need and I can make those clothes last over a year (seeing as most of my clothes now are several years old). The only thing that I would even consider buying on a regular basis is shoes...and that is because I like funky shoes...but because of my current income I don't even bother to do that because I don't have the money.  Of coarse there are things that I would like to have...but there is nothing out there that would make me want to go out and blow thousands of dollars on...a three hundred dollar watch...gimme a break...I would loose it. 200 bucks for sunglasses...fuck that...I can get a decent pair from walmart for 10 bucks...sure it doesn't have a "label" on the side of them...but it blocks UV rays and such.  Which does remind me I do have to go get some clothes because I just don't have much in the way of normal clothing...most of my clothes consist of RAVE clothes that I don't really wear all that much anymore.  I sit across from Abercrombie and Bitch...and I see little people going in and out all day and wonder...why would you spend all that money on something that has a real value of maybe twenty bucks for several things.   The only thing that I really have a vice with is computer equipment...and I get that because it serves a function and makes my life easier...like I want a new keyboard and mouse combo because I go through them fairly quickly (I wear them out). The set I have my eye on is really to much money...but it would be something that I can use on a daily basis. I want gadgets...cause I love them. However I don't indulge until I have the money to get them because I don't want to go into massive debt to get something....the only thing that may change that soon is to get a new cell phone...I have my eye on several but the dream one is pretty damned expensive...but it would be almost like a laptop setup. What I may do instead of that is buy a cheaper model, buy a cell card for my laptop, and in time get a new laptop that will last me a long long time...and really I would love to get a Tablet PC instead of a laptop truth be told...but a laptop would be better suited to what I want to do with it...such as coding on the road, building sites on the road...and of course game on the road.  Again these are things that I want...but at this point I am not going to go into massive debt to get one...at least not yet.  Well I am going to get some shuteye because tomorrow I have to face the throngs of people yet again...jeesh!  Peace out yo!

      This is new to me...but it shows Dean's commitment to using new technology to get the message out in a big way....and it probably saves money allowing him to reach more people for less cash.  I present to you  Dean TV . You will need broadband to see it...but it is a great way to get the message out. You have to install some simple software and from what I have seen of it, it does nothing as far as spying on you. A worthy download in my opinion.  On to other things...not much got done today. I have to work tomorrow...woohooo!  I may update a little later.  PLUR

      I just took a blogger poll...thing is the polls that they never allow you to write in things or give you enough choices to really get a poll sample down correct...  For instance one of the questions is how long have you blogged with blogger...without asking how much you have blogged in the past...and then one of the questions is were you one of the first in your group and did you introduce it to other or did others introduce you to it..  Well a fair question would have been to find out how long people have been blogging...for me it has basically been on and off for around 4 years now...with my original blog type forum on a site called Camarades...when it was a free web cam site...I had typically 20 users on my webcam all the time...and I updated the page almost daily with what was going on...so that could certainly be considered blogging...then I laid off of it for a while until I moved too my apartment in MS where I set up my own web server and hosted my own blog...then when I moved back up here I started blogging on /. for almost six months before moving over to blogger...and I have been with them ever since because they have been very reliable and easy to use...  Over time my blog has evolved somewhat and I would love to continue to use this service but in the future I will probably move to a movable type based blog...I would love to get the pay version of blogger as well...and I may do that just to keep it simple...with that package you get photo hosting and expanded ability to move things and customize...and that is what I need...so maybe that is what I will do in the end...  Well enough for tonight...I have a nasty sinus infection that started yesterday and has been kicking my ass all day today and is worse tonight...so if it isn't any better tomorrow I will have to call the doctor and figure out what we want to do...because the damn thing is migrating south for the winter...and south is the lungs and I don't need that again.  Well I am off to bed...night all!

      Not much to post about today seeing that it has just been another day of the same old same old...waiting to see if anything will be made of the election problems looming in the national media...  Once I have my main box up I plan to put together a presentation as well as search out the source code for the voting machines so that I can put together something that the media could take off from.   Then I will pimp it around to the media...of coarse I will post it hear first or link to where the presentation will be hosted (probably on my webspace with Verizon).  I think that I can be annoying enough to get it somewhere with the mainstream media. As it is really important for them to investigate the claims that there may be problems...I am thinking Dateline mainly and then CNN...or maybe 60 Minutes as I know that both Dateline and 60 Minutes take on hard things...with 60 Minutes being the premier in journalistic integrity for many years...hopefully they would pick up on the story.  I plan to contact people who have been involved in the process up to this point...and I plan to offer my own information once I have obtained results when I get the software...I also plan to have programmers look at the code and bring those programmers in who have looked at it thusfar so that we collectively could present a complete story with much of the research already done so that networks would only have to validate and air the story...it is about time we get together...  This all depends on when I get RAM back for my box...I plan to spend around 6 hours a day on the story until I figure it out for myself and to hound everyone involved so that maybe something constructive can be done.  I urge you to all help if possible in some of the tracking of company leaders...who they are tied too and who they have dealt with. That would be of great help...and of coarse those who come to me with information will be credited if they so desire...or remain anonomous if they so choose (as this may cause quite a stir and get some high ups pissed off).  Also I plan to actually crack the voting machines if they are deployed here in my precinct during the next vote and then publisize that I did...in the hopes that they would bring prosecution on me so that we could push it out into the mainstream if that is what becomes nesecary...I don't want to do it...but if I have to then I will...and I will make the information on how to crack it once I have it available to all so that others can engage in civil disobediance through what is essentially voter fraud...but for a good cause...to remove the idea of Blackbox Voting.  Send me your thoughts...I need to hear them as I am embarking on what will prove to be a hard and long journey that I am compelled to do. It is time people take action and I have said that many times without having done much myself...so I will take my own words to heart and bring my experience and knowledge (albeit limited) to the table and offer it up to the idea of Democracy.

      In the news as of late there has been a lot of hoopla about the leaking of Amb. Wilson's wife as a CIA operative from the Administration.  I watched a bit of the debate back and forth between the various parties and watched the press secretary come out and give a statement.  All of this back and forth leads me to believe that first and foremost it is most definitely a partisan move on the Democrats behalf simply because of what is at stake here. If it can be proven that the Administration did leak the name and Robert Novak (a CNN analyst amongst many other things) reported it in a piece he wrote for the newspaper then indeed their would be indictments of the people involved in the leak.  The leak itself was intended to send a warning out to anyone who might speak out against the Administration and its policies so that people may think twice and not speak out fearing that the Administration would use its considerable pull within the government to find anything to attack the reporter or person who might speak out. This has been a tactic that has been used repeatedly by all administrations and it must be pointed out that both parties are guilty of using such tactics whenever the opposing party is in power. It is nothing new to the overall scheme of things in Washington.  The bigger question here is did it happen, if so what will be done, also who knew inside the administration, and who authorized such a leak of sensitive material.   Also this brings into question the credibility of our secret dealings around the globe. If informants and operatives aren't protected and are to be used as pawns in political games then we may loose our best assests around the world in fear of them being found out then prosecuted and quite possibly put to death by the people they are informing on.  Another point that needs to be made is when something of this nature comes about is it the duty of the reporter to reveal his/her source if indeed the rumors are true. The answer is an unqualified yes to that question. Not because we want to discourage people from being informants, but more simply because we want to discourage blatent abuse of the reporters and the weight that their voices carry in modern media.   Leaks happen on a daily basis, but no leak like this has ever come up. It truely is of national security and pride in our foriegn intelligence services that comes to question. If we can't bring in the rogues that try and bring others down because they don't like political views or because someone doesn't like what is being said why not just go ahead and kill people off instead of tarnishing reputations...it is in the end much more human and a more forward and to the point action. Subtlety has never worked in the past, but actions do speak louder than words.  As for the administration it is claimed that the leak didn't come from the white house, but they can't confirm if it came from the administration. Well come on folks, the administration is the white house...all edicts come down from there to the various foot soldiers to be carried out. So the fact of the matter is that regardless of whether it was someone directly in the white house or someone in the broad administration is of no relevance...because they are inextricably tied to each other.  Some say that it was Karl Rove who leaked the information. If it was shame on him and he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Besides what value is it that he would hold such sensitive documents as he is really just a political advisor and not much of anything else. To think that he would have access to such sensitive information is rediculous...and there is no doubt that he does have access to documents that really he shouldn't.  The President share cuplability in this whole mess because of what he has said in the past. He stated that he would bring back integrity to the office and that the buck would stop with him. If that is so then regardless of where the leak came from and whether or not he knew explicitely shouldn't matter because he pledged to be responsible for all actions taken in the name of his Administration.  In this search for answers I have gone looking for ways to deal with the problem seeing that it really is a problem that extends up to the President regardless of whether he tacitly knew of the events...and it brought me to the impeachment process.   In looking up the impeachment process it revealed that impeachment is really a difficult thing to do and rightfully so...but would be impossible to actually implement in this case because of the makeup of the government and how it is controlled at this point in time.  Here is the actual law that calls for and outlines what is impeachable activities.  "The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  --U.S. Constitution, Article 2, Section 4"  The process to do so is quite convoluted and requires something that can't be achieved even if all the allegations prove true because of the makup of the congress in general.  Taken from a law website which I will give the link to at the end of this post.  "The Impeachment Process in a Nutshell  The House Judiciary Committee deliberates over whether to initiate an impeachment inquiry.   The Judiciary Committee adopts a resolution seeking authority from the entire House of Representatives to conduct an inquiry. Before voting, the House debates and considers the resolution. Approval requires a majority vote.   The Judiciary Committee conducts an impeachment inquiry, possibly through public hearings. At the conclusion of the inquiry, articles of impeachment are prepared. They must be approved by a majority of the Committee.   The House of Representatives considers and debates the articles of impeachment. A majority vote of the entire House is required to pass each article. Once an article is approved, the President is, technically speaking, "impeached" -- that is subject to trial in the Senate.   The Senate holds trial on the articles of impeachment approved by the House. The Senate sits as a jury while the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial.   At the conclusion of the trial, the Senate votes on whether to remove the President from office. A two-thirds vote by the Members present in the Senate is required for removal.   If the President is removed, the Vice-President assumes the Presidency under the chain of succession established by Amendment XXV."   As you can see it has to go through many stages and all of those stages at this point are controlled by Republicans...so even if there were clear and obvious wrong doings it would be impossible to actually proceed with an impeachment no matter what the public outcry calls for.  F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr., (Jim), is a Republican Member of Congress is the head of the Judiciary Committee so you can see that even if it got to this stage it would be shot down. The committee is stocked with more Republicans than Democrats. Here is the list.  Republican Members                Mr. Hyde (Illinois)                     Mr. Coble (North Carolina)         Mr. Smith (Texas)                       Mr. Gallegly (California)             Mr. Goodlatte (Virginia)              Mr. Chabot (Ohio)                      Mr. Jenkins (Tennessee)            Mr. Cannon (Utah)                     Mr. Bachus (Alabama)                Mr. Hostettler (Indiana)           Mr. Green (Wisconsin)               Mr. Keller (Florida)                    Ms. Hart  (Pennsylvania)           Mr. Flake (Arizona)                  Mr. Pence (Indiana)                   Mr. Forbes (Virginia)                Mr. King (Iowa)     Mr. Carter (Texas)     Mr. Feeney (Florida)   Mrs. Blackburn (Tennessee)    Democratic Members    Mr. Conyers (Michigan) Ranking Mr. Berman (California) Mr. Boucher (Virginia) Mr. Nadler (New York)  Mr. Scott (Virginia) Mr. Watt (North Carolina) Ms. Lofgren (California) Ms. Jackson Lee (Texas) Ms. Waters (California) Mr. Meehan (Massachusetts)   Mr. Delahunt (Massachusetts) Mr. Wexler (Florida)  Ms. Baldwin (Wisconsin) Mr. Weiner (New York)   Mr. Schiff (California) Ms. Sanchez (California)     So as you can see the votes would go pretty much along party lines (20 Republicans and 16 Democrats) and the vote to get it out of committee would be shot down before it would even be considered for consideration that an impeachment might be nesecary.  If the allegations prove true than he should definitely have the impeachment process started as he would have broken the law...in addition it would include VP Cheney as well as others in the Administration.  The plain fact is that Mr. Robert Novak should indeed reveal his sources if nothing else in private to the appropriate authorities so an investigation could proceed. Without that key bit of evidence the investigation will die on the vine so to speak.  Remember that we actually impeached President Clinton and the vote was against removing him from office. The vote wasn't agaisnt what was at the time the Whitewater scandal as they could not find the documentation to actually use in the process but instead the moved ahead anyway with the fact that he lied about getting oral sex from an intern. Basically they impeached on the fact that he lied.In the end it wasn't enough to impeach him.  That brings up special prosecutors. This strange phenominom was implemented in the seventies as a way to get independant investigators into the mix as it was seen that the Justice department often comes into conflict on matters of this importance seeing that the head of the Justice Department is appointed by the sitting President...and often the head of the Justice Department is reluctant to do anything against the very person that gave him/her the job. This bit of legislation had a sunset clause put on it and it lapsed in the late nineties (or thereabouts) and was not reinstated because it was seen that independant investigations often proved fruitless in the matters they persued partly in responce to the fact that they were often denied the very information they needed to proceed.  So getting an independant investigation into this matter just simply won't happen because there is no law requiring it.  On another note it has been well documented and seen in Washington over the past few years that outside investigations by any body have also wained and in most cases simply not happened because of the often used "if you question the policies and intentions of the Administration then you are a traitor" view. So many things have happened that warrent investigations regardless of who is in power that just simply haven't happened because of the stigma of being labled an unpatriotic american is simply to much to fight against seeing that the White House has on several occassions used its executive powers to launch probes into investigators and them leaked the information to the media so as to discredit the investigators.  While at this point we do not know who leaked the information, my money is on a high admistration official that wanted to attempt to intimidate and discredit Amb. Wilson...a purely political move that if his investigation into the Niger uranium deals had become common public knowledge that discredited the claims of the Bush Administration that Hussein was trying to get Uranium from them would most certainly lead to the questioning of the policy of war in Iraq.  Also I read my new issue of Time today and they brought out some pretty interesting information to the effect of because of the widespread corruption within the Iraqi government Hussein may well of thought he had weapons when indeed he didn't because of the lies and misreports given to him on those weapons programs. It would seem that the scientists and people in charge of those programs knew better than to screw around with the UN on this...their only mistake (which can be excused) is not having documented the destruction of said weapons. If they had documented the destruction of the weapons surely they would have been put to death if the documents made it to Hussein...as we all know he aspired to have all sorts of weapons. The deception that was perpitrated was to protect the lives of the scientists in charge of the programs from the very dictator that was telling them to "build them or die" so they had great reason to lie and not leave a paper trail about the lies.  It comes down to this folks...Hussein had aspirations to achieve nuclear weapons and terrible other weapons...but in reality his own scientists, who were just that and not party fanatics, lied to him to save their own asses while giving him the documentation that they were making progress even though it was all a big hoax. They did admit however that they kept a few weapons back to test the shelf life of the weapons but they were eventually turned over to the UN inspectors who then mislabled them and lost them in the clutter...so even the small amount that we have found (something like maybe a couple dozen warheads of chemical weapons) were in fact already documented and known of by the UN but through snafu's in their procedures they we not kept track of and eventually destroyed.  When all of this washes out in the end the Presidents rational excuse for pre-emptive strikes will prove to be a bad policy based on the fact that people can simply lie about the extent of programs...and it goes to show that not even dictators can know everything that is going on in their own country....  I am pretty sure that Bush has no clue of our own chemical and biological research that is thriving even though he touts the official position that we are destroying out stockpiles. That gives him deniability when it comes down to it...he didn't know the scientists were developing new weapons...because our policy is officially to dismantle those projects.  We will all have to come to the understanding that our leaders are not omnipotant people and can't have detailed knowledge of everything that goes on in government even though they claim to have intimate knowledge of what all is actually going on. Maybe that is a good thing, maybe it is a bad thing...but that is just simply the way that all governments do business.

      Having read through the links all of them seem to be of worthy consideration considering the possible bearing it might have on the voting of Americans.  Also of note is that some of the farther left leaning links as well as the links to the source code bear no fruit as the servers are either down, or the sites are removed which would indicate one of two things bearing on the credibility of the debate at hand.   First is that the information and opinions are true and that the sites have been "removed" in the light that they damage the quest for power that people in power so love...this would be a blow to us all because they are in essense supressing free speach. That would be a crime. I find it wholey possible that is the case because if people and investigators were to get a hold of the source code for these machines and it was indeed found to be poorly programmed with the ability to change election results at a mear whim then it seems that we have all lost...and in that we should all be screaming in one voice "release the code, let us judge if it is adequate and protects our rights".   The other possibility (although I tend to think that the first possibility is a better one seeing the actions of Bushco and the far right republican party) is that the claims hold no water and if the information was let out then their claims would be proved to be wrong. They would simply not hold up to public scrutiny and that would lead people to discredit the authors of said stories...and we all know that discrediting is the way to go when you want to dismiss "conspiracy theory" over just denying it.  I think it is the first possibility because it is a matter of law. All Diebold has to do is claim DMCA over its work and that shuts down all research of said code because to actually investigate and critisize said code would leave an independant researcher open to litigation. To simply post code that is a product of a large company is strictly frowned upon by the courts even if said posting of code is for the benefit of the people.  Remember that one of the main arguments for the case against Microsoft in the 90's was so they would release their source to operating systems for other software writers to be able to look into making their products integrate more effectively into the OS...well Microsoft was ruled against in that regard with the government finding to not post or release the code to credible sources or companies was a violation of anti-trust (RICO) laws. So they had to release the code in question (which happens to be a discontinued OS...Windows 95. Apparently the lawyers for the government didn't specify that newer OS code be released although MS has been a little more willing to let people peek into the guts of newer OS's...although they are still fiercly protective, and rightfully so, of the inner workings of Windows XP).  This all smacks of something scandalous...and we should demand an investigation into it all.  One other scandalous thing is the exit polling. It used to be independant of the government election process...now it isn't by law. All of the exit pollers basically have to adhere to the same rules now and report findings to the same place which then distributes that information to the news outlets...so in this next national election it can be expected that we will see delays in exit polling numbers so that things could possibly be changed on the fly without making it seem that someone is rigging the election...all very tidy as to keep the public in the dark.  I have been, and am all in favor of Electronic Voting as long as you get a reciept of the vote in paper so if results are questioned then there is still a paper trail somewhere (and it would be better if the machines held a reciept as do cash registers for keeping a paper trail). However reading some of the election law it seems as though using electronic voting machines as they are in current form violates the voting laws specifically designed to keep fraud at a minimum...and the voting laws also cast doubt on even current voting systems because votes are not hand counted (as made so painfully obvious by the Supreme Court blocking a Florida hand recount).  On another note I watched a program on Worldink TV the other evening about the Floorida debacle...and the voting process in general and it would seem after having been two years that the ballots would be counted by now by the government...but they have yet to be counted...they were counted by the media and it was found that Gore actually had more votes so in reality the Electoral Votes of Florida should have indeed gone to Gore...but because a hand recount was blocked by the Supreme Court (which by the way has five conservative judges on it out of the nine...all of which were appointed by Republican Presidents) the true and accurate count was never done.  Also of note was the issue of "overvoting"...in which some of the ballots were not clear on how to vote (especially if you are an idiot and can't read directions). There were thousands of these overvotes which machines counting the votes just simply didn't count, however the vote for who the person was voting for was painfully clear...i.e. People punched or filled in a blank for Gore then wrote his name in where it says "Write in the name of the candidate you are voting for"...for some that would mean a double check...but for informed people it would be for the write in ballot (which we still have...and I wonder if it will still be there in the electronic ballot)...  In addition the voting laws also state that the vote must be made in handwriting...so machine votes don't count in the first place.  It is all very dis-organized and we need to clarify the law to allow for machine voting in the first place...but at the same time the process in which a person votes needs to be transparent so that fraud will not occur...  It is sad to think that it may not be even worth voting knowing that your vote on one of these electronic ballot machines may not be counted or it might be changed when the votes are phoned into the counting centers...  It is all pretty scary on how we have lost our power over the government.  One other thing...I hate typing on this laptop keyboard so for me to do all this typing is pretty impressive...it goes to show that I have to give my opinion on this because it is sooo important...  Go Vote...and demand a reciept of who you voted for so that in the end if the votes don't add up then we can demand the correct victor to be put into office whomever it may be.

      Hey before I head to bed I have a few things to post...from a reputable news source in the Tech world...as a matter of fact the inquirer has been dead on in its reviews and breaking news in the tech world for several years now announcing new products, previously unkown problems in software, and genrerally being dead on with predictions "from reliable inside sources"...so the following links I give you with the complete knowledge and full faith that they would not knowingly ever report anything that was questionable or false...when it comes down to it I think they are a hell of a lot more accurate than even CNN when reporting news outside of the Tech world...so here are the links....   Interesting story number 1    Interesting story number 1   Again...I trust them as a news source...I ask you to visit the pages and then follow the links...I haven't read all the stories yet but I am working on it...considering I am reading all of this on a shitty laptop screen it is taking me a while...you will notice that one link in one of the stories is already dead...as it has been killed (probably by higher powers because they don't want the info to get out...that link holds the source code which has not been independantly verified by computer security experts for the new Diebold voting machines...which Diebold happens to be run by a huge Bush supporter...an independent review would allow for security flaws to be found and for possible ways to cheat also be found...remember that recently the government sued Microsoft and one of the aims was to open the source code for independant review so that companies would be able to better write software...but I guess in a case as important as voter trust it is more important to keep things totally secret!)  So go read...read people...get off your asses and click the links!!! It is very important...is has to do with the fact that your votes may not be counted if the party in control doesn't like the way the vote is coming in....it is important to you whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Green, Independant, Nazi, any party voter...it is important to us all...it is important to voters period...  Damn and I thought that machines counting votes in a totally digital way would at least be built with good protection in them...so that votes would be counted and no one would be left out of the vote if they voted...  I am soooo mad about this whole deal...Democracy...ha for the wealthy...I guess the addage is true..."The Best Democracy Money can buy".

      Hello all from my laptop...yay it works!!!!  hehehe  anyways I won't be doing huge updates because this keyboard is a little small to type on and I hate typing on it...but at least I will be able to update each day...  Well today I sold 88.10 worth of stuff...that is good...at least I know that it wasn't my charming personality keeping people away last weekend when I sold pratically nothing.  I hate my job but I love working...make sense to anyone out there?  I have to get up at the butt crack of dawn so you will have to excuse me if this is short but I am tired and I my hips hurt a lot from standing and walking all day long...so I am going to get some rest.  Hopefully tomorrow there will be a slightly longer update...  PLUR and stuff...

      Yay! I get to work tomorrow...yay!  I don't really like my job oustide of the fact that I sit in front of Abercrombie and Fitch and they have hotties in there all the damn time...I really need to wear loose clothing to hide my "happiness" at the fact we are located where we are...hehehe  Outside of that I leave out of the place and I just feel dirty...I really do. I walk out of the mall at the end of the day and I feel filthy...I just want to wash the filth from my body. I guess I just hate the consumerism that is in there...sure I love going into stores and buying things...when I need something...but christ I think that malls are just filthy consumer shrines that we have built to appease the gods of corporate america...where we spend ourselves into such debt that we could never even imagine a life without it...  Hey I guess that is life...but I am glad that I don't have outrageous debts...and would most likely not want to get under any big ones here soon.  Till whenever I get back online...cause tomorrow morning I take out my RAM...yeah baby...

      I was up for a few hours really just to do treatments and put food in my body and now I am off to bed again as tomorrow I have to work. It will be good to get out of the house tomorrow for a bit. It will give me a break.  I got to talk to Jonelle the other day as she was able to catch me while I had my phone on and on me...so we talked for a bit and she is coming out in December for Christmas and we plan to meet up then and have a good time...and my sister may be here as well so she can give me an outside opinion as to what she thinks of Jonelle.  I would seriously date Jonelle if she we here or I were there (in Callifornia where she is)..but that isn't happening right now. I am planning to go out that way once I get a lot of my crap out of the way and maybe get a little healthier. I have cousins out there that I have never really seen since they we were all tots so I could see them and then see Jonelle as well. While I would be out there hey I can put in my Resume' out there and see if I get any nibbles. You never know.  Well I am going to get back to bed...my sleepytime meds are kicking in and the screen is getting blurry...  Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect to all.

      Well I looked at my bosses computer today and boy is it fucked up in all sorts of ways. She has spyware, worms, bugs, virii, and just plain crapped up software. However being the guru I am I will be able to sort it all out with some time and patience.  On my way back from her place I stopped and picked up LOTR: The Two Towers and The Italian Job (which I got the wrong version...got the full screen instead of the widescreen version). I am watching LOTR now and enjoying it greatly. I just wish the sound was a little more even as it gets loud and quiet quickly. Its just meant to be watched loud.  Well I watched part of the debate on CNN tonight and Dean did much better and was allowed much more time to voice his views. In this debate he won hands down as being real and telling how he would do things. It was a nice thing to see as the other candidates (especially the ones out of Washington) all pretty much sounded the same. I was waiting for him to say a couple of times "shut the fuck up fucktards...you haven't done anything to stand up to Bushco and voted for everything he pushed through." Alas he didn't, it would have made for a more interesting debate if he had.   They are still lacking in some ways though. They need to stand up and be different, and out of the pack only two are doing just that. Dean and *gasp* Sharpton. Again I don't like Sharpton but he sure is fun to watch because he brings some life to the debate where as the rest (except for Dean) look like stiffs that have been coached on how to be more lifelike.  Well I am going to watch the rest of this and hit the sack. If you can catch the reruns as you will see what I mean.

      Now I am morally oposed to downloading music because it can deprive an artist of a few cents on a CD sale, but I am more moraly oposed to support a corrupt organization such as the RIAA.  The RIAA has seen sales drop at around 10% over the past several quarters and has blamed the continuing downloading of pirated CDs on the internet, but according to their own numbers downloading of CDs has dropped about 40% in the last quarter so something doesn't jive here.  I think what has happened is this and it happened before and they blamed it on another reason similar to the current CD piracy over the internet. It happened when they moved from a primarily Vinyl based system over to Cassette tapes. They blamed copying of cassettes towards the end life of cassettes as the reason for the dropping sales in cassettes. Yet when you look back at the actually numbers you see that people simply updated their collections and those sales were just slipping because many had completed their updating. So in the initial years people bought a lot in the way of cassettes to replace vinyl they already owned and as it got towards the end people had already bought all they were going to buy. Even though the record industry at that time blamed it on cassette copying as the reason they saw sales drop. However they had a replacement ready in the wings...the CD-ROM or CDs as we know them. They offered superior sound to all previous formats (although they lacked the warmth or depth that vinyl often had) but the initial high cost of CDs kept sales slow but steady until the early 90's when it really took off.   I remember that I got my first CD player in 91 and I started buying CDs then as I started to work. I bought about 12 a year. Once I started making more money I was up to around 40 cds a year. Now that I am out of college and broke (partly because of shitty economy and higher costs of living) I no longer buy that many cds. Instead I do download most of them now and burn them off.   Now as I have said sharing is bad, but what is worse is the RIAA selling a product for anywhere from 10 to 23 dollars for something that clearly costs less. Even during the era of narrowband and hourly rates you could still download a CD and burn it for about the same cost as that...now we have broadband and cheap cds and a person can do it for a fraction of the cost.  As far as the artists are concerned you will find most of them publicly support the RIAA as they control much of the media content that is seen out there as well as the retail channel that gets their music into stores. In private many aren't that worried about it because in reality they see very little from their cd sales in the first place. A band or musician may sell 10 million copies and only recieve a small pittance (maybe 100 thousand dollars if lucky) for those sales while the music companies and RIAA see millions upon millions. Again many of the artists in private don't mind it that much from what I have gathered...and in addition I don't think those artists that don't benefit from the marketing machines in the industry would really mind at all because they may see nothing for their work at all. With the spreading of their music online they may see increased ticket sales at the box office which the artists directly bennefit from instead of the labels.  There are some new venues to sell music and this is one of them  this company may be changing the paradigm.  They give 50% of sales to their artists and allow free downloading of music of their artists for sampling. Now I am sure as more bands move over to this business model we will see ever decreasing costs for music and artists that see more of their work going into their pocket. Check out the site and see what you think. If you think it is a good idea go ahead and patronize their service.  Also I downloaded the new Bubba Sparxxx album...and it is very good and laid back. The problem is that outside of Deliverance you may never hear the other tracks off the album even though they are all pretty good so far. I will be adding this to my car collection to bump...as it is good R&B/Hip-Hop that isn't trash. Good work Bubba and I am looking forward to hearing more. I am sorry for downloading it without purchasing it but if I knew of a place to send you the 10-15 buck directly I would be more than willing to do that as your music is pure gold.  I don't have an aversion to paying for music as long as I get to test it first and then as long as the artist gets the lions share of the money paid.  Peace

      Well today I spent most of my day asleep with the exception of a few hours due to whatever is grabbing a hold of me and making me ill. When I first came back upstairs to head to bed and before writing this I puked up what was a good dinner brought over by the neighbors...I feel so bad because it was good but I was coughing so hard it couldn't stay in.  I was up for The Daily Show with John Stewert as it was live tonight. I guess I expected more out of them because it wasn't as funny as it could have been. As you may have guessed it was a live show covering the Recall Election in California.  I also watched a little of the coverage on CNN and something really struck me as odd. As early as 9% of the polls reporting back Wolf Blitzer was calling for an expected Davis concession of the race to Ahhnold (I can't spell his last name right now). Now this seems kind of funny to me...but don't you think you would at least wait until 50% have reported in to see what you would do? I guess counting votes really isn't as important as air time and we all like for our news to be quick and without any real merrit or substance. CNN is also calling the election now with only 33% reporting back that the recall went through and Ahhnold wins. Again...33% is only 33% that leaves (to overstate the obvious) 67% of the votes not counted.  Which brings me to another question...there were supposedly 13 million or so that came out for the election today. By my calculations if 33% have voted 4.2 million votes would have been counted...but on CNN it shows that only 2.8 million have been counted. If there were only 10 million or so voting that would still be 3.3 million votes counted...so where are the extra votes or are the initial reports incorrect about the number of voters that would come out. Also how do we know exactly how many actually came out.  I am actually for Ahhhnold in all this mess believe it or not. He is a moderate Republican with liberal social views...now the real test will be what he does when he finds out there is a mess to fix and he either has to cut programs or raise taxes...and it will be interesting to see if he settles the lawsuit with the energy companies because the state really needs the 9 billion or so from them back.  I am all just a little leary of it all after having read reports on the new systems that are in place in some places out there...but to be fair they are mostly on the old system that has proven ok in their state for some time.  Well I am a sick puppy and I need to rest for this coming weekend. Goodnight all.

      I was informed today by one of the people that I "work" with that all of the Israeli women that I have met so far have thought that I was cute...and there was one that she is definitely hot enough to not toss out of bed for eating crackers....after hearing that news today I figured out why she was acting the way she was acting towards me yesterday...she was very giggly and silly (like a little school girl)...but she is no school girl rest assured...so it was nice to find out that someone out there still thinks I am attractive in some way.  Today was long and tedious and in the end I still fealt dirty. I am just glad that this day is over and I can get some sleep...because over the last few days I have barely gotten any with this sinus infection and now a dimension thrown in for good measure...I have a sore throat now. Great. Now I go into the winter cycle of sick, well, sick, and then well, all the while my overall health looses ground. I love the winter but I hate how it makes me sick.

      Interesting details coming out about Ahhnold and Enron...if proven to be true (which we might only see if he is elected governor) it could mean that lawsuits filed against energy companies and their flagrant pilaging of California consumers during the supposed "evergy shortage" could be in jepoardy...to be sure they were short on energy...but the reality is that they were overcharged for the energy they did get by the energy companies...  Read and learn more about it.   Scandal looming?   Why do I bring these things before the public? Because I want people to think differently, question everything, and form opinions. Without that all hope is lost. Take or leave it...only the people have the power to change things and if we routinely allow our power to be usurped then when all is said and done we will have no one to blame but ourselves for the mess we are in.

      Well I got into another verbal sparring match with my mom today over the issues facing all of us.  She is still blind when it comes down to it...in the past I have considered her to be an informed and therefore educatable person...but I retract that idea. She still cannot see that the policies both my grandmothers and her generation have tried and used have failed and therefore have sown the seeds of discontent in the world. She cannot understand that the reason we are under attack from so many sides is because of the policies of prior generations and her own towards both Africa, The Middle East, and Asia and her subcontinent have put us directly in the crosshairs. She cannot bring herself to the idea that we aren't the good guys when it comes to  those parts of the world...that indeed we are the enemy and it isn't because we are "the infadel" or some other novel idea...but instead simply because we have opressed and killed many of their fellow countryman.  When you have the policies that the United States has had since the end of WW2 (1945 for those of you who have no clue of history) you are bound to make enemies.   We have consistantly had policies that bring us wealth and power while leaving the rest of the world with the tab. You see wealth is a finite thing. You can think of it in the simplest of terms...and here they are.  The world is made up of three disinct things...people, space, resources. Each disting thing you can break down into tenths. For the United States we have the following pieces of the pie...in people we have one fourth of one tenth of a percent in algebraic terms 1/4(1/10)% (we have about 280 million citizens the world has roughly 6.5 billion people)...in space we take up about the same amount...in resources we consume about 2.5 tenths (or 25 percent)...and if you want to boggle the mind we pump out about 25% of the total polution in the world.  Now our population is growing at the average world rate...with that growth it would not be long before we would require the entire power output of the world...so as it is now.  Now take into mind that our current power suppliers (oil, natural gas, and leastly coal) are all fossil fuels that are rapidly declining in supply...you end up with a population that is eating more and more power...with less and less available...and the rest of the world...well we Americans don't care about that do we?  That is where the resentment starts to come into play...not so much that in these little shit countries around the world even really need tons of energy like we do...but that we are taking their share of it without really paying them for it...so we are stealing it...and don't give me the line "we pay 30 dollars a barrel of oil"...yeah our oil companies pay that to themselves...and the money eventually heads off to regimes that don't like us...but like our money, and in turn those regimes opress their people and torture their citizens...when if they didn't have that money in the first place everyone would be on equal footing.  It really is so complex a problem that it is hard to lay it out in a way that makes sense to the Average person. It's not that people can't understand it...but rather they would prefer to think of America as this big benevolant provider of goodness throughout the world. When in fact that our government has long been involved in things that would never happen here...we funded a shaw in Iran for years that killed untold numbers of his own people...then he was overthrown by Radical Muslims (who then turned their hatred towards us because we backed the shaw)...then we paid for and helped the Iraqi regime of Sadaam Hussein develop WMD's to kill Iraniians (who for them confirmed we were out to get them so they hated us even more) not to mention that the people of Iraq knew where the weapons we coming from and the money was coming from (America)...the people that were propping up that evil regime...then when we looked like would fix it all and called on the people of Iraq to rise up with us against him in 1991 we left them flat...don't think they forgot that (so now we are targets there).  Afghanistan...we have an even worse story there. Nobody in the sixties or seventies could tell you where that country was...hell most people here now couldn't find it on a map (so much for our great educational system...leave no child behind...). Then in the eighties the USSR (our great evil foe...that is a whole 'nother story) invaded because it was on the lower end of the great Caspian basin of oil (they tried to consolodate the entire capsian region for oil purposes knowing that if they controlled oil they controlled the world)...so what did we do. Well we just got out of Vietnam so we weren't going to go rushing in there...plus not to mention it would have been directly Russians against Americans so we sent money....and lots of it. Untold billions actually. We funded a little known dude at that time named Usama Bin Laden (or Osama if you spell it the way americans do) and his Al Queda network (not sure on the spelling of that) and the mujohadine (again spelling) that fought against the Russian. We even sent advisors (as we did in Vietnam in the beginning) to teach them to fight. Well we taught them well as the Russians taught the Vietnamese well how to resist an invading Army...the Russians suffered a million or so casualties...but at our dollar.  When they pulled out in 88 everyone sang and danced it was a great victory for all but the Afghani's...because once the Russians left...so did our dollars (even though many people were of the mind to keep dollars flowing in to stabilize the political future as to a pro-western government...but we got burned on Iran so we decided not too)...when our dollars left the country fell into civil war for the next oh....lets say 10 years (our own was a brutal 4 years long) from which emerged the Taliban. Lo and behold we started funding them. The money was to obstensively go towards the destruction of poppy fields in our war against drugs...and they were effective at that as well as killing people, cutting clitorises off, stoning...all sorts of fun. When we asked for a little favor in return (an oil pipeline secured by troops from the Caspian bowl to India where an get ready for it....Enron power plant was) we were flatly denied...this coincided with the Planes into the towers...  Don't get me wrong. We should have gone after the people who perpetrated that. However if you will all recall it happened once before. We knew at the time (or soon after) that it was Al-Queda as we caught the dude behind it and he pointed his finger at bin Laden. Now why did we not go then? We could have (some people would say we didn't have the balls or Pres Clinton was weak...well he wasn't he actually promoted an unpopular position in the Baltics and sent troops to somolia which he then abandoned) tehn but didn't. People died then as well and they struck out our guts...but this time was a little different. And besides we knew who it was but we still haven't found him...why did we need to invade when all we could have used was special forces to surgically weed him out. Because we had a larger goal.  A lot of this is round the board on the "making sense scale"...but from what I have read, put together on my own, and been shown is this. That America really isn't as great as we think we are...sure we have all these great things (which I readily partake in)...but it all comes at a cost to the rest of the world. We steal, polute, and rape everyone else in the world so we can live the way we do...using the current technology we have.  How can we change it all. Well first of all we need more nuclear power....hey it is unpopular and has had its fair share of problems...but overall it is still fairly safe and can give us the go juice in a few years time rather than having to curb our appetites while waiting for better technology. The other thing we can do is research research research...and a little research on the side. We can innovate our way out of this...we can invent our way out...we just need to spend the money to do so. Under the current system we never will...but maybe just maybe the system will change a little this next election and we will see real change and maybe we can get ourselves out of this mess...  As for cleaning up the human collateral we have spilled around the world...we can't. All we can do is sit back and take the lumps on the chin. It doesn't mean we have to take it laying down...but it means that we have to live up to the mistakes we have made and make a good faith effort to fix them.  Point out one country that we haven't screwed and you get a gold star...cause we have screwed them all...if you look back far enough.

      Ok so now I am finally going to bed...finally. Tomorrow I have to pick up my grandfather who went into the hospital today because he nearly died at his dialysis...oh joy. I get to hear him bitch when I take him home...great.  Then Sunday I get to return to the crass commercialism of the mall to sit there and laugh at people and read a book.  I finally got that download in and installed the software and actually started a little site. Now all I need is the stuff from my friend and I can spiff it up quite a bit and add some stuff.  I think it will turn out nicely because it already looks good even though I am using one of the built in templates...as time goes on I will create my own for her but for right now a default template will do. There is a lot that I have to add to it.

      I was contacted by a long time friend of mine (well I consider her a friend even though at this point we are more of aqaintances (SP)) and she would like me to help her build (read build) a website for her resume and modeling resume...lemme tell you this thrills me to no end. I of coarse agreed whole heartedly and want to do a good job...so what am I doing right now? Downloading some software to make a kick ass website.  There are things that I would like to do for it and I have some ideas...I just need to get the relevant info from her so I can start working on it...I will build for her at first something to get started (read good) and then add features to it as I learn them. It will be a great learning experience for me forcing me to get some things done.  I am giddy over it all really. I haven't done a real website for anyone but I have done a few for myself (but never been happy with how they turned out) so it will be nice to get something going in that arena...plus if I get something put together that is the bomb diggity I could get other work from it. That is always a good thing.  I took a day off from reading today...I really should have sat down to read the rest of the book but I didn't want too today. I want to save it for Sunday so I can read the rest of it. Note to self...get some highliters to highlite some of the good material in it...  After I get done with it I will probably get some other books to read...My next may be Jim Hightowers book. I also want to get one titled "Bushwacked, Living in Bush's America" I think that is the full title...anyways I think it would be a good read.  Well right now my DSL is bogged down crunching away at a 450 meg download at an avg. of 80kB/s...really fast but not as fast as a Cable modem (but DSL is much better for gaming.)  I also have to get together an updated price on a web server (basic type) to build one out for a friend and see what kind of fast DSL I can get to where (1.5 Mbps each way I think is 300 a month...not bad for a T1 linespeed).  I talked to my mom today as well and I got what I consider is one of the nicest compliments from one of my hero's. Bryan told my mom that he loves when I comment on his site and that I am very well spoken (or written) and have original ideas...my mom also told me she loves to read what I write (I know she is supposed to hehehe) but it was nice nonetheless because someone is actually noticing.  I would also love to point out that Bryan is probably the most articulate person I know in real life as he is able to pull together disparaging topics and roll out a final product that is easy, amusing, and informative to read...that is a real gift that he has. As always I check his site daily and try to glean a little of the genious from there and incorporate it into my life. (ohh ego stroke ego stroke) But seriously he is one of the best writers that I know personally and one of the brightest bulbs on the grand christmas tree of life. Kudos B.  Peace...keep reading and learning. Keep on keepin on.

      Yeah one of the Jewish girls has a little thing for me I am certain...and I dunno what to do. Perhaps it is because I have been out of the "game" so long. I really have no clue where to go from where I am at (silly banter) to where I want to be (freaky circus sex).   Maybe I should explain the ladder theory to her...although she doesn't speak english very well so I would have to use even more simple terms to get the point across...then I would know for sure where I fall on the ladder.  What is the ladder? What is the ladder theory? Oh my you are missing out. Let me link it for you to all behold. I hold it as self evident as the forefathers held certain truths to be self evident. This is truly a master of work that needs to be taught in college...hell even in high school as it would save a lot of energy and perhaps keep a few kids from blowing their brains out or shooting up the high schools.  Well maybe not....but it certainly is worth a good read and from personal experience it is dead on.  I present you with the  ladder  theory.  Enjoy...and oh yeah I feel like a dirty whore.

      As I read more and more of Al Franken's book the more angry I get at the right of America...it just infurates me to no end to recall some of there efforts now as a liberal (or moderate liberal) and see them all in a new light as I continue to educate myself in what is really going on.  To think it is even legal to be a Republican is beyond belief...because they have done just terrible things and whenever they get caught they downplay it all...but by God when a dude gets a blow job he has to be impeached (remember impeachment is actually for any federally elected person).  The point is this folks. Republicans blame Democrats for all that is wrong and accuse them of class warfare over and over again.  The truth is that the majority of our current problems with terrorism are spawned out of the eighties and the regimes and terrorists we funded (al-queda being one of them from Afghanistan). As for class warfare I would say that the Republicans have waged it ever so much more effectively. Essentially they have given a pass to all rich folks on taxes (and those rich folks who cheat on the taxes that they should pay rarely ever see any repercussions when a person that makes fifty grand a year would likely see his or her livelyhood destroyed by the IRS due to penalties imposed for a minor indescretion that a rich person makes yearly on their tax forms).  The fact is that the rich have gotten richer to the tune of 110% of "real" money or value since the eighties while the lower class has actually lost about 10% of "real" money or value in that same time...so the poor get poorer. If you question these statistics you are called a traitor or said to be conducting class warfare because you blame the rich for getting richer...no I blame them for the poor getting poorer...I don't care if they get richer but only if at the same time we see the same numbers of growth across the board...because as the rich get richer prices go up and those that are actually loosing money value suffer because of that and are forced into ever deeper debt just to keep their heads above water on actually doing things like feeding their families or making sure they have heat.  Class warfare can also be seen in the educational system as this...public education is a mess. We all pretty much agree on that. Private education is the only way to go in many places to have your kid achieve something...but if you can't afford the tuition you don't get the better education. So only the rich can afford to be educated (when in reality they usually are the among the dumbest of people out there because of their "selective" inbreeding to keep wealth at the top.)  Another thing that irks me is this...the debate of the 87 billion dollars needed for Iraq.  Well actually it is the 67 billion needed for the military portion. Yup thats right I am questioning "supporting the troops".  The question should be this...what are we getting for the 67 billion dollars? My thinking is this. Ok so it is going to the troops right? Well is it going to pay the salary and combat pay of the troops? Well some of it will...but the point is this. The regular pay should come out of the existing Military budget because they would have to pay them that salary anyway if they weren't at war. The combat pay should be paid out in the 67 billion because that wouldn't and shouldn't be allocated in the regular budget. The same goes for all the reservists...subtract the normal monthly costs from the Pentagon's normal budget and the extra to have them deployed come out of the 67 billion.  Surely some of that money is going to go towards replacing all the HUMVEE's and APC's being blown up. My question is this. Don't we already have a buttload of these vehicles? I mean since the eighties the budget for the military has always been over 200 billion a year...during that time you would think that they would have amassed hundreds of thousands of these vehicles...and seeing that the HUMVEE is supposed to have a service life of 12 years or so then it would make sense that a lot of them would still be around. Sure we need to replace them as the get destroyed...but can't we replace them over the next few years instead of all now...and where are all the rest of them?  Ammunition...ok this is a given...they need it...we don't always have huge reserves of it so it needs to be bought. But does the budget cover new M-16's, M-224's (the squad weapon), M-60's...if it does we already have millions of M-16's and tons of the rest of them...so do they need new ones? When in fact the majority are still using M-16 A1's...I can understand updating them all to M-16 A2 or M-4 status...but that should come from the regular military budget as they would have to do that anyways.  Missiles and bombs...hey again we have been spending all this money for all these years and we don't have a buttload laying around? Yes we need to resupply...but why are we running short in the first place.  Fuel...yup you need that and you really can't make huge stores of it...so I can understand that a large chunk would go for fuel...but at the same time we just invaded an oil rich nation...I'm sure they are getting there gas at less than 1.50 a gallon.  The questions should be "what is the 67 billion paying for?"...is it covering expenses that would normally be covered in the regular budget...and if it is what is the normal budget going for?  I would challenge them to give an accounting for that money...the 20 billion I can actually understand. We bombed it we bought it...and I bet if you found what looks to me to be the fraudulant overcharging of the military to the taxpayers we could come up with that 20 billion in savings from this appropriations bill.  If it is all straight up...then so be it then it needs to be spent...but if it isn't on the up and up...then withold the money until they can explain the new expenses.

      I am getting restless and am getting close to wanting a new phone...if I get a better job here soon I will be getting a top of the line Pocket PC phone with built in Qwerty Keyboard for Sprint...the phone is the bomb diggity but costs over 600 bucks right now...but that would get me a new phone, a camera on the phone, and the pocket pc that I have wanted, plus the ability to hack it and let me go online from a laptop anywhere...by getting or making connectivity software that allows me to tap Vision services over a USB cable...  Ahh just need the money first...I need to get Ebay'ing

      I started reading Al Franken's book today...and it is as good as Michael Moore's but a little different as it goes specifically after certain targets like Ann Coulter, Bill Oreilly, and others...thankfully instead of just spewing lies as those people do he backs up all of his statements about them with facts that are readily available.  When you are faced with bald faced lies like he has done with all of the people he has attacked (so far as I have read 110 pages into the book) it would seem that these people would at least tone down the rhetoric...but instead they say that people are lying about them or they lie about lying about lying about something (no that isn't typo...it is meant that way for a reason read the book and you will see that some of the people lie about lying about a lie they told in the first place).  Again I haven't ever had so much fun reading a book as I have had with these two...and they don't even have naked women in them...that is totaly awesome! Well they could add the naked women and the point would still be driven home that unfortunately America has been lied to and too many people buy the lie.

      For the first time ever I bought a book and read it all the way through in one day.  What is this marvel of writing brilliance you may ask?  "Dude, Where's My Country" by Michael Moore.  Pure genious...get it and read it...then reread it. The book is just excellent and he is able to bring together many of the thoughts all of us left-wingers have been feeling for quite some time. In addition he basically says in some places "suck it up and stop being such whiney little twits". Those are my words...and they are great.  It is a great book with bits like this on pg 72 "Ethiopia (nothing like sending a squad of starving children to help!)" and this one on pg 71 "Afghanistan? What exactly was their contribution going to be? Horses? Ten sticks and a stone? Don't they have their own problems at the moment?" both on the Coalition of the Willing.  Or this one on the left admitting it has made some mistakes a dealing with them "Why are you still bitching about right-wing author Ann Coulter? Sure, she's as crazy as a loon, but she's got more balls than the entire Democratic Leadership Council. You're just jealous we don't have an Ann Coulter. And stop looking at her damn legs! That's why she's got you so jumbled up!"  And this one "Animals don't have rights. Yes, they should be treated "humanely." Yes, Tyson Foods and all the others that "harvast" chickens are disgusting. But "freeing" chickens from their factory farms is idiotic. They don't know how to survive in the wild and they're just going to get hit by a truck...This shit just makes me wanna go kick my dog." (a bit was left out of that one about milk and whatnot)  I really like this book.  Today I bought it and Al Franken's "Lies and the lying liars that tell them" and I will start that tomorrow.  Well I am going to be...as it has been a long ass day so far!

      Gotta love Bushco and their endless peddling of this war. We are in the thick of it and they say all is rosey and going well. Americans dieing at the rate of about 6-8 a week right now doesn't seem like things are going well. As well as the prospect of our troops being deployed for a year or more (just think about it folks they are already strained with 140 thousand troops deployed with there being few reserves to send so to think that they will be back after a year is a little optimistic at this rate of "recovery"...I personally think troops may be deployed longer than a year possibly up to two years with little R&R.).  While I want to say to the troops good job and way to go and keep your asses safe I would also like to say this...quit bitchin' you signed up for it...for service and while it certainly isn't fair that your there and I am here you all certainly knew when you signed your enlistment papers that the government owns your ass for the next few years and they can do with you what they please.  If it were up to me I would bring them home now...the Iraqi's seem ready to take over...and if they are in the position of holding an election but that can't happen until all our companies secure contracts and we pacify the entire nation. I would say get out and let them handle it...let them rebuild off of oil revenue and let oil companies actually compete for position over there like they would elsewhere.   However I think another reason Bushco doesn't want to leave them to their own devices yet is a pretty good argument...they would likely duely elect a very Religious Right government -ala- Taliban style. That probably wouldn't be good for us...but hey there is a lot of medicine that we are due. We are Americans we can take whatever they dish out.  On another note I started writing something of a book. It will certainly contain better grammar and punctuation than this blog (or at least I hope it will). The running title is "I'm Not Coughing, I'm Laughing. A life with C.F."  So far I have a prologue already penned out. It needs a little more but I will write more as it comes to me. I have the first chapter penned out completely as it is the shortest that basically starts out my life...and hey what can I say other than "I was born...then diagnosed two years later. All was normal for the first five years of my life." That is pretty much what the first chapter says but in a little more wording and with a little background to build consiquent chapters on.  I don't really expect it to be published but you never know. If it all comes out as something really short I may enlist some of my CF friends here in PA to write a little about their lives and compile it into a book together with the title still being "I'm Not Coughing, I'm Laughing. A look into X lives with C.F."  It is a novel idea (heheh forgive the pun)...and I think it is about time I pen out some of my ideas. Plus I have two works of fiction that I really need to get to work on. I have rough draft outlines for them all I need to do is flesh them out and make the worlds that I dreamt up reality in words. The one story I already sort of told here on this blog a few weeks back. It was the dream that scared me half to death...but the dream was so real and the visuals are still there. I just need to find the right words to put it down.  I love working but I hate my job...and that is about it for this update. Till next time. Peace out yo!

Civil Disobedience over the Diebold Voter Machine problems that threaten to take away our right to an actually elected official.

      Well not much really to post or rant about today except that some new law has passed that makes illegal certain Abortions.  While personally I am pro-life my political view is pro-choice. What? What the hell Mike? What kind of wishy-washy position is that?  It is simple for me really. I am a man...or at least last time I checked I had all the male parts. My personal beliefs and views are my own and not to be laid on anyone else. Should I stop a woman from having a procedure that is completely up to her deciding? She will be the one that has to live with it both good and bad...so for me to impose my views on her is rediculous...and for me to support any law that would restrict that basic right (to choose to do something) goes totally against even the Bible.  Yes even the Bible. For all you religious nuts out there your God says one thing...and really it is his only basic tennent (even though a larger tennent would be to love each other) but that basically says...You have the right to choose to believe or not. You alone are the sole decision maker to make decisions that go with him or against him...but in the end you will be held accountable for those decisions.  A life is a life...but a bundle of cells that is essentially treated as a virus for a period of time in a womans body does not take precedent over that woman...as she is complete...the bundle of cells is just that...a bundle of living cells. We have no problem attempting to eradicate Anthrax (unless you are the US gov...then you try and develop it into a weapon), trying to stop the flu bug, or fighting AIDs...all of those are living beings...but they are considered bad so we have no problem in trying to kill them.  Again I am distressed at the new law and it would seem that we are on the road towards outlawing abortions all together which would be a bad thing...a bad thing because it takes yet another right away from the people.   The right to have power over your own life.  Think about it and fire back at me if you think I am wrong. I am willing to debate this one to the hilt...and unlike many out there I see both sides...but I choose to side with freedom.  Tomorrow I go to the docs..and I fear that I will be heading to the hospital tomorrow...we will see. As always I will update and let people know what is going on.  Peace

      I am tired and I still have to go get my mom in a couple of hours from the airport...I am tired...hey can I say that again I am tired.  Today was yet another day in corporate consumerism hell...the mall is possibly one of the worst places to work. The "twinkie" factor was really out today.  For those of you who don't know what a twinkie is. Here is the definition. Twinkie: Noun, pronoun: 1. A tasty sugar flavored and cream filled snack cake made by Hostess. 2. A derogitive description of the female of the species that looks like everyone else i.e. dressed alike with same cell phone attached to ear. Usage. Wow! That twinkie tastes good. or Wow! Look at all the twinkies walking by...I think I just got diabetes...please god kill me now.  Yes a twinkie in this context is the way girls dress at the moment...about a year and a half ago or two years ago black sorostitute slut pants were all the rage...in and of themselves they don't make you a twinkie...but if you are blond and in a pack and all have similar shirts on....then those are twinkies. Now it is Abercrouchy and Scratch...almost like scratch and sniff.  The only delight of my day is lunch in which I put my headphones on and escape into a realm of music (not the continuous loop crap they run at AF which we are across from) head upstairs and grab a slice of pizza or some other tasty morsal of mall food.  I must rest before I head out to the airport...so I will probably not update again tonight unless something comes up.   Till tomorrow...rage against the machine, throw a monkey wrench into the works, and break it all down. Because until we build a new one we will be stuck with this outdated piece of shit we call "the system". Funny in a culture that loves to aquire new shit all the time we haven't gotten a new system.

      Well I went down to see Danielle this evening...and I must say she is the most bomb ass person I have met in a long time. She is truly a funny person...its good to see a sense of humor in someone who has just gotten the shittiest hand of cards dealt to them.  We took a few pics and here is the funny one...I am very self consious about my teeth...out of everything my teeth are the thing that I would change about me first...I would love to have perfect white teeth.    She has a piece of cardboard in her mouth that is yellow/orange to make me feel better about my teeth. It was funny as hell.  She really boosted my spirits tonight. I dunno but she is damn kewl...and while I was there I got lots of comments about my hair. Everyone loves it...yay me!  Well I am tired and wiped out from the meds...I am going to get some sleep.

      Here is a good read on why I think that in their current form TouchScreen voting machines are a bad idea   Voting machine problems.   I would be behind a voting machine that was designed by our best and brightest at MIT, CIT, and CMU...otherwise if it is built and maintained by corporate interests then the vote will always be suspicious.  This artical is well thought out and written with grace and poise...yet is able to get to the problems in simple elegant language that even a moron could understand.  Read it now! Or don't...but be forewarned our vote is no longer our vote it is now controled by big business!

      I am ever more amazed at the overclocking ability of my little P4...now getting 3.00Ghz on a 250FSB at 1.65 Volts...damn this thing is just screaming!  I was having problems getting the P4 to ramp up higher than 2.7Ghz but I figured out why it was having problems...the RAM was way overclocked and wasn't agreeing with that speed...so I clocked it down a little and it is showing me some love...it is running at slightly over 200Mhz (or 400 DDR rates)...  I love this little Shuttle box!

      Well that was strange...  Ok...the phone I am getting is a SprintPCS Vision phone that supports data rates of up to 144Kbps...that is quasi-broadband. It will be fast enough for internet on the road and hospital trips...so that will be great. Now I just need to save for a new laptop.  The laptop I figure will run about 1700 bucks. 2.4Ghz or higher, a gig of RAM, Radeon Mobility 9600 128mb RAM, and a smallish 40 gig hard drive, plus Wi-Fi.  That would be good.  Well I am tired and I need my beauty sleep.

      No pics of the case yet but they will come. I need to finish off the damn thing so you can see the full cool blue effect that I am going for. I need to order a couple of blue LED fans and some other crap...once I have all that up and on it I will get you pics :-)  The hospital wasn't so bad...although I had a rough start. They came in to access my port and only had a 19 gauge needles. That is big when I am used to a 22 gauge. When the dude first tapped it he didn't prime the needle with saline so he would actually be able to get a flow...so he had to take it out and go at it with another needle. When he drew the first one out it bled a little and he slapped on some alcohol just for good measure. If you want to get that feeling cut yourself with some paper and dunk the cut in alcohol...that would be a close feeling. Only this was on my boob...so it hurt a lot!  I was able to spend a lot of time with my new friend Danielle...she has been in the hospital for around 2 months now. She is currently number one on the Lung Transplant list...all things considered she looks pretty good for only having about 10 percent of a lung working for her. I would imagine that is how bad it is but I don't know what her PFTs are.  I try to tell people what I live in and some may see me as complaining and saying that I have it worse than many others...well I do. This was confirmed by Danielle. We both are in the same boat (while I am not nearly as ill as she is though). She has run into the same problem in conveying this to others who aren't CF patients and looking down the barrel of death all her life (as I do). She has friends and family surrounding her but yet she is alone in the struggle. Only CF patients can sympathize with each other as to our illness.   I guess part of it is that we want to desperately be independant and healthy but we know we can't have that. I have often felt almost disgusted when people offer to do even the most simple of tasks for me and generally treating me like a gimp. Now its not that I don't need or want the help, but instead if I need or want it I will ask. Danielle is in the same boat. Sure she can't do everything and needs a lot of help, but I think she feels the same way I do in that we don't want to put upon people to do the simple things. I know that people aren't put apon by helping out if they offer but it is still just the pride issue...CF patients pride themselves in being as independant as possible (from my experience at least) and it is just hard to ask for help.  I think that is why her and I are getting along so far. I will help when she asks but I won't jump whenever she coughs or try and shuffle her things around to help out unless she asks. That is the way I want it in my personal life. I think she sees that and respects that. Because it is sooooo frustrating to have all that attention placed on you when you cough, or when you poop out, or for anything. We want to be normal and conduct ourselves as best we can. The best thing I think I can say to people is treat us like a normal person, if we need to rest or need help we will ask. Don't ask me repeatedly if I need a break...if I need one I will take one.   I took my lucky buddha that was given to me by a friend John and Amanda and gave it to Danielle, I also got her some bamboo. They have helped me and I think they will help her.   Here is something that I am going to ask my friends out there in cyberland. I don't do it with ease because of my own personal beliefs...but if you could do it I would be greatful. If you all would say a little prayer, or whatever, and keep her in your thoughts I would be greatful.   Also I remind you that you need to fill out your organ donor cards or check the box on your driver's license to be an organ donor. It would be a great help for all. You never know you may need one yourself and if people would just do it we would all be better off.  Here are some links.   Official Organ Donor Card   Another one   Remember fill them out and keep them with you...also tell your family that you would like to be an organ donor so they know as well.

      I will be going back to XP this next because I will be getting a new box. Longhorn is really nice and it runs ok...but there are somethings that I am not ready to give up just yet...and that is Norton System works. Without any kind of protection from Virii and many other things I am afeared (yes I meant to spell it that way) that I will run into problems.   Once a Beta comes out...or the final product I will stick with XP.  Until next week I will run it and see if I get used to it...but I will most likely switch back.

      There are some programs that don't play well with Longhorn...Norton SystemWorks 2003, DataPilot (phone software)...so there are some things that need to be worked on...outside of that it is ok  The boot up time is long, the shutdown time is a little long, and the browser renders a tad slower than IE 6...the installed version here is 6.05.  Looks good overall...but needs a little work yet. I will keep it around for the time being to see how it works.

      I got it installed and I am on it now...the graphics are creamy. It also has a built in download manager that is really k-rad!  More as I see more :-)

      Well I am installing Longhorn Alpha on my desktop box...so far creamy. I did an upgrade...but I would rather have a fresh install so I am re-installing it on a clean HD.   What I saw of it while I ran it for a few minutes I liked.  I tried a few months back to run it...but the build was way to early and buggy. Now it is more mature and easier to work with.  Also all the drivers I threw to the new OS it liked so I think I will run it for the time being.  Well I am going to monitor it and give updates as things go on.  Oh yeah I figured out what is going on with the desktop system...it just doesn't have enough juice to run at the speeds it should. So I am going to be replacing it and give my mom my box...with the specs that I posted before.  The new box will be a Soltek EQ3401M...that will be creamy as it has room in the system for two optical drives and two hard drives. Plus it has a mega 250watt power supply.  The power supply is key here. Becuase that current little box has a 200watt power supply and it just can't keep up with the requirements of the system that I am running. To many whats are being drawn off.  Plus the box just looks creamy.  What it looks like.   So I should have all the things upgraded by mid-week next week. That will be hella cool. The drive bays are stealthed on it so it looks hella sweet.   I am happy that I will be able to get everything ready for an extended stay in the hospital. In the near future I fear that I will be spending a lot of time there and if I am going to have a system and I can't afford a good laptop for some time then I may as well go ahead and make sure that my system is portable yet powerfull.  I am off to monitor the install now. Peace.

      Ok...so I think I figured out what is going on...finally. Well maybe. We will see after some gaming what happens with this machine of poo...yes it is on my shit list right now.  Working fine at high speeds for a while then just doesn't want to co-operate. It is still OC'd but only slightly now...and that cheeses me off! (although I am getting a free boost in speed anyways!)  So I went shopping. You see my mom wants to get a computer and wants to spend less than 400 bucks on hers. Hell I can do that. Well I can do it will shifting things around :-)  First of all since my system will not run at full speed because of problems with power (yes I think the Power Supply and Mobo just can't handle the wattage demands) I can run it safely at up to 200FSB (=800 FSB with QDR on P4)...  I shopped for a Celeron 2.4 on a 400Mhz FSB (which can safely be overclocked to a 533FSB and the mobo will do it well withing its 800Mhz limit), two sticks of RAM for a total of 512MB, and the requisit drives that would be needed to get it up and purring like a kitten. The total came to 387...now lemme remind you it will be a 3.1Ghz Celeron after the overclock, CD Burner, DVD Drive, and 512MB of Dual Channel DDR (at 333Mhz), and over 50 gigs of HD space. So that is a kick ass system for the price. But I would have to get a new Mini-System to replace mine....which adds 260 dollars to the price.   That 260 is actually less than what I spent on my Mini-System barebones in the first place (doh!) and as her processing needs grow I can add a faster processor. The only drawback that I can see is the built in graphics...but that can be remedied as well if the time comes.  So the total comes too 648 bucks (rounded up) to get me back at full speed and get her a kick ass system! Plus my current system has a pretty nifty case! Also it would be powerfull enough to run Longhorn when it finally makes it to market! YAY!  So I am going to talk to mom about it...I could pay her back the 260 bucks over time...or it could be a Christmas gift from her and GM...Either way it gets us both up and running.  As for other things...well I got a new music reporting thing for my site as you may see here.  My health is shitty shitty bang bang...I hate being sick. The steroids are really fucking with me right now. They make my blood sugar go all goofy and when I take the prescribed dose of Insulin to get it back down it crashes down instead of just easing down (I nearly passed out today even though I took less Insulin than was prescribed for my Blood sugar level of 287).  Also the roids are making me very edgy and mean...I am on a very short fuse right now. I mean short. I nearly yelled at GM and Eileen today...even though they didn't ask anything taxing of me...it was just so close. I could barely control it. So I appologized for being short and warned GM that the roids are making me looney. I told her that I was on a short fuse and that if I snap at her I don't mean too and she needs to call me on it and tell me to calm down. While that will make me madder I can distinguish between the roid anger and true anger and cool off...or at least I hope. I am going to call the Docs tomorrow and see if we can do something about that. I am already a prick...I just don't need this putting me over into the Asshole catagory.   On another note I finally got my system to recognize that it can capture video and I got GNN's "Unanswered Questions" ripped onto my hard drive...it is a large file and I encoded it twice. Once for broadband and once for High Quality. I will try and find a place that has big storage as they are big ass files and will require mucho bandwidth allowances to download. However I think I will be able to get it out there. It is a good video.  Halliburton had its extension of a contract cancelled today. YAY! Partly because the Pentagon came out and said that it was being charged twice as much per gallon of fuel than it should pay (it pays around 1.20 a gallon now and Halliburton was charging 2.49 or something like that for fuel to Iraq...the pentagon says they can do it cheaper with their own equipment and even shipping it from the US if nesecary)  Bectels contracts are coming under scrutiny finally as well.  Well I am going to play a little bit of SOF2 and then hit the sack...I am tired.  Peace  Warning...I have roid rage!

      Well I don't have to go to the hospital again...well at least yet.  Instead I am going on a heavy diet of steroids and insulin. We will see how that goes. One good note is that the steroid will help me gain a few much needed pounds.  Computer is still acting like a whore. I contacted the manufacturer and we will see what can be done. I am hoping that we can just exchange it for a different product. I just think these sticks are not suited for this board as they give off much RF noise...as can actually be heard if you hold your head close to the case and scroll a page.  The next step is if I can't get that fixed then I will have to get different RAM. I would go with Corsair XMS Pro...which has crispy LEDs that indicate activity. They will be expensive but they will be a good investment as they can be moved to a newer system when the time comes.  I may in the end have to build a new system. DAMNIT! I hate that!

      I take back the crashing thing...I think I may have found the cause...indeed the hard drives are part of the problem...but the RAM is giving off a strange buzzing noise as I scroll or do other things...when I wiggle a RAM stick and get the noise to stop it does stop...but sometime the computer freezes...so I am thinking that part of the problem may be the way the RAM is connecting. That would really suck...but it might be ok because there is some new exciting RAM out on the market that would make for a good replacement...and it has pretty LED active meter lights built in.  I watched the Debate tonight on CNN. Rock The Vote.  Overall this was certainly a better forum than I have seen in the other "debates". I will break it down for ya'll as I see it.   Dean  Dean got trounced in the first few minutes. However let me explain why. He made some statements lately saying to southern voters that he wanted those guys in the pickups with Confederate Flags voting for him and that he was the Candidate for them.  Immediately a dude in the audience got up and called him on it...trying to bait him into a corner and then let the others pounce. Which it worked well. He said essentially that he wanted to extend his campaign to everyone white, black, brown...everyone and you can't simply label people as racist  and others as not. We need all people to vote to get Bush out.   I think Kerry was the first to pounce demanding an appoligy. Dean tap danced a bit.  Sharpton took exception to that and attacked...and did so effectively. He called for him to appologize. Dean said that he wouldn't and stood firm. Saying a few things but really danced around a lot.   He was attacked again and then nailed it home. This isn't about race...this is about including people and you have to get through to them on their level...even if they fly those flags. It is time to stop being goaded into a Race debate and focus on just people.   My personal thoughts on it are the Republicans have been the ones to make Race an Issue and play on the fears of both sides...and have gotten away with it because they deal with the extremes at either end of the spectrum which are never likely to get together and compare notes...so they would never see the lies told to them.  He got some of his views across on GLBT issues...which at least he stood firm on civil unions.   Kerry  Kerry...well he came off ok...but he was a stuffed shirt and unfortunately wasn't interesting. He didn't really say anything of note. Except I think he didn't get the meaning of one of the audiences questions which was framed in a baseball analogy. It was whether or not he would switch out people if they become innefective as Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, Wolfowiz, and Rice have. He eventually said he would...but instead of taking it one directly he used analogies...don't appologize for having a view. Just make sure it is informed and you will never go wrong. He was also asked about hunting and didn't really impress me on his gun policy, but he did say that if we enforced the current laws then we wouldn't need new ones...he took a pot shot at Dean because he has gotten an NRA endorcement in the past.   Clark  Clark...well he fell flat on his face. He simply wasn't able to articulate his ideas in the least. The question that you could tell he had problems with was GLBT issues (Gays, Lesbian, Bi-Sexual, Transgender)...he just didn't make a good impression.  In the end he is really a political puppet for the Clintons...and frankly once people realize that he will loose what support he has. Not that people don't love the Clintons...but it would be easy to make a case of hipocracy against him because we are making a big deal out of Bush being a puppet for Cheney or Rove. The knife cuts both ways and people need to realize that.   Sharpton  He continues to impress me on his ability to connect. I don't like him...but he at least is a real life person and not something mysterious. Not much to note although he was much more aggressive tonight than he has been.   Braun  She was very demured...very stately. Her answers were well thought out and easy to go with. I think she realizes she can't win but wants to bring her issues to the table anyways and maybe the candidate that does win will carry on the ideas.   Edwards  Not much to tell. Motivational...but that is about it.   Lieberman  He was at least more lifelike...less like a corpse. He needs to pull out. He really is to nice of a guy to be doing this. Also he is more like a republican than most republicans.   Kucinich  Ahh behold the dark horse. This little guy is the wildcard. He would be a Green party member but has the smarts to be a Dem.  His website.   Look over his policies. He is excitable and doesn't speak well but he has all the concrete ideas and has maps and plans to back them up. I have to give it to him. If candidacies were actually run on platforms and ideas this guy would get the nomination. He has so many ideas and goes after many things that don't make sense and would be better off changed for all of us. Of particular note is his "water for everyone" ideas, full gay marriage (he said that in the debate tonight and got perhaps the loudest set of cheers and applause), all sorts of things that would help us out. He has laid down the research for you to look at.  By far the best candidate for issues and ideas...but the worst because he is so far left of center that he almost crosses round the globe to opposite side...but I bet he is there flippin them the bird and telling them to pick up their styrofoam burger boxes.  Just check out the site.  For me I still support Dean, but in a close second for me is Kucinich...  Well that is it...

      I found a couple of 160GB SATA Hitachi drives...currently the top rated for 158 a piece. 8MB Cache, 7200RPM...Hitachi bought out IBM storage a while back. IBM got a bad rap because of some faulty drives...but out of all the ones I have used they have been the most reliable...although I did not have that particular model. Plus the drives offer a three year warranty...hard to come by. Also the shipping is included. They have 250GB versions...but they are much more expensive. Like 315 bucks...now I ain't gonna pay that for another 100 gigs of space...nope.  I would need to get a couple of external cages for the drives I already have...as they are faulty but not dead yet....so I could use them for extra storage...which would mean that I would need another power strip and possibly a small nuclear plant to power it all.  If I get the external housing units for those and some of my other drives I would have about 510GB of storage total...more that enough to rip my entire CD collection plus some.  2 - 160GB = 320GB (7200RPM SATA) 2 - 60GB = 120GB (currently in my box to be put into external units 7200RPM PATA) 1 - 40GB = 40GB (7200RPM PATA) 1 - 40GB = 40GB (5400RPM PATA)  = 510GB of total storage  That would give me plenty of room to play with I would think. I have some movie stuff that I need to get on here and convert to digital format so I would need that kind of storage overall.  Well I am extremely tired and I am going to pass out for a while...  peace all  oh yeah and it hasn't crashed since I rolled back my Nvidia Drivers...

      Ok so my box isn't running as stable as I would like it to be...I think that I am suffering from HD failure...on both HD's nonetheless..crap!  We will see after this next reboot...I am going to have Norton Scan them to see if it can come up with something.  It really is a shame because most new hd's come with only a year warranty...they used to all be three years, but in these days of fast moving technology and cost cutting they dropped most of their coverage.  I am going to go ahead and shop for some new drives just in case...this just sucks ass!  Oh yeah and I feel like shit on top of it all...for the past three days I have been coughing up lots of blood! I hate that! I go to the docs on Wednesday and if I am still coughing up blood I will probably be headed back to the hospital...I know that my PFTs have dropped since I left because it feels like it.  I just hate this time of year when it comes to health. Over the past two years during this period of time I have lost over 20 percent of my lungs...so I expect I will loose another 10 percent this year to infection. That will bring me down into the 40% capacity level...and bring my already low O2 sats down to around 92 or 90 on average (they are at 93 to 94 average now)...and the most important indicator, the small lung passageways are already down to 10-12% of normal...and only bound to get lower (that is where you actually get your oxygen)...I think that I will have to seriously start to think about transplants soon...it won't be for a year or more...but I had better start to prepare myself...and make the decision as to whether or not I want to get transplants.  It just boggles the mind.

      Well my day here at the mall is nearly over thank blue glowy orb (you thought I forgot my promise of not using God and instead using Blue Glowy Orb)...well like I said it is almost over.  Today wasn't to terribly busy overall because therer wasn't much traffic in the mall...although we did do a pretty brisk business today. So I don't feel to bad just sitting on my ass all day long.  I also got a pay cut. Well she at least asked me before she cut it. Actually I am relieved because she was paying me way to much for what I actually do which consists of me getting here in the morning, opening the cart up, dusting (if I feel so inclined), and then just pretty much sitting here to people watch. Sometimes I sell something...but that isn't a guarantee.   It really is just kind of a dull around here. Although as I have said before I work with interesting people. The Israeli's next to me are pretty damn kewlio...and the Indians to the other side are great too.  It never fails to amaze me how many Israeli women this dude has working for him...I mean it is like a veritable eye candy sugar overload....so I guess I do enjoy myself a tad.  Also working in the mall is evil...but I do get to see all the hotties wandering around here...theree are some that I would just do very dirty things too...on Thursday there was this obious bit of jailbait strumpet...but damn did she have some legs on her. I wanted the to be wrapped around me...but that is illegal (to be fair I am pretty sure she was at least 17...maybe even legal...either way DAMN!!!!).  Well as I sit here and ponder what I will have for dinner (my mom is coming to take me out) I must reflect on some sad news out of Iraq.  16 US soldiers were killed today in a helicopter crash...well it was actually shot down. Another 20 or so were wounded.  The more time goes by the more I get angry about that whole mess. It is simply terrible that all thise guys up there in power (except Powell) basically did everything in their power to get out of Vietnam...and did so quite well. Yet they are the "patriots".  I can't wait for the 04' elections...so at least we all may have the ability to get this train wreck of a country back on track.  Once that happens maybe we can get back some of the good will the world once held towards us...but if we have another 4 years of this crap...we're screwed, and there ain't gonna be a kiss afterwards.

      Well I nearly have my laptop ready to go for tomorrow...all I am waiting for is a few updates and all will be swimingly well.  I am almost completely convinced it is time for a new laptop. This one is just damn near wore out. She has served me well. Almost time to move on and find a better one...preferably one that I could even game on if I felt the need.  However I am thinking that I will go with the most portable system out there...something small and lightweight yet powerfull enough for basic computing. Maybe something with a Centrino (or Pentium M processor)...I just don't know yet. We will see.

      Ok moms computer is pretty much finished...all I need to do is transfer over old data from one of her hard drives and I will be all set...but I think I will do that later today before I install the DVD burner...as I will have my case open already.  Wow...it has been a long nite...so now I must rest!  But on the plus side...the FSB pn this beast os 1078MHz...or in CPU terms my processor is 3.25GHz....and the RAM is running at a cool 437MHz at CAS 2.3.3.6...very tight memory settings.  The temp on the processor runs around 45C which is damn good for the overclock that I have running now. I also got a little more out of my video card...it is running at 46oMHz core and 640MHz RAM...so that is also fast.  A lot has gone on...and by god it is all working.  Expect that the posts later today will be more political as the 30 hours of Senate Debate should be wrapped up by then...all ready for me to comment on that whole mess.  Till then...peace!

      Well it is all up and running back where it was...oh yeah.  Now this new system is running at much higher speeds than I would have ever imagined before. I mean really this thing is screaming along without a hitch at all.  Now what am I gonna do with all this power? I dunno...but I know I am gonna have some fun with it.  Right now I am waiting on a Download for Nero 6.0 and I am still waiting for a drive that should come tomorrow...TDK Indio DVD+-RW 8X and 40X CD Burner...woah nelly!  So I guess I just need to get moms up and running  She has a Shuttle Mini system now with a Celeron 2.0GHz that will be overclocked...512 Megs of RAM, 56K modem, and 40+ gigs of HD space...16X TDK Burner and a DVD Drive...now I just need to get it up and running for her.... :-)  w00t!!!

      Well this system has been actually running for almost a week straight on Windows Longhorn. Now for peeps running XP out there thay may not seem like such a long time...hell I had XP up for two week stretches at a time without much incident many times. However...Longhorn in its current form is still very very beta...as in they just got some of the features implemented...and not all of them work, but for it being an early beta it has been rock solid stable for the basics. I just simply haven't needed to reboot the system.  Now having said that it is starting to slow down even further...a result of one of many memory leaks I am sure. All OS's have memory leaks...it is just how well each OS deals with those leaks is how we end up with a good or bad experience. In the 9X platforms things would grind to a halt almost daily...you would need to restart and refresh the system. About every six months you would need to reformat and just do a general house cleaning on a system  NT was a little better in its various forms...the memory leaks it experienced were easy to deal with as the memory managers they built into the OS were a hell of a lot better at keeping things tidy. So if a program went rogue it was easy to terminate that process and free the memory it was using. That carried over to Windows 2000...and probably 2000 has been the best OS to come out of Microsoft. With NT systems it was and is common for them not to need rebooting but maybe every week or two...unless you got a virus or just liked messing around with tweaking your systems out...then you may be in for reboots daily regardless of the OS you choose.  XP is by logic an extension of 2000 and it inherited quite a stable of features...mainly reliability and usability...but it also inherited some of the nastiness of 9X series of OS's...that is Virii...that has been the bain of a one OS environment that Microsoft is quickly learning. To make a system that is easy for users to use...you have to ratchet down many of the native security features that XP Pro has and they ended up with Home...now the big problem is they are the same in almost every way but because you have the home version out there you essentially dumb down the people and make them lazy as to keeping their systems safe. If they were all getting the heavy corporate or pro edition with all the security turned on we could possibly cut down on the Virus plague.  With Longhorn Microsoft will attempt to do that...and really I hope they can do it...sure Microsoft is big, bad, evil, world dominating, and all that is wrong...but in the end they have brought computers to the masses. They have made it easy for grandma to get her email in many aspects.  Other os's are trying to get there too...and to be sure OSX is a great OS...really I will give Apple Credit where credit is due...they have great products...but because they are expensive they have marketed themselves out of the 400 dollar computer arena...which is where the growth is being seen.  Linux...great...another player. It is a great OS as well...but overall if something goes wrong there aren't many resources to go to and get help. The Linux community is its best asset and worst foe...most of the people in the Linux movement who are academics or are genuinely computer people are willing to help people out...then there are the toads that are elitist assholes who act as if you are a retard because you couldn't get your sound card to work. I have run into both..and that is why I run Windows...not because I am retarded but because if I need help I am not always sure that I can deal with ignorant pricks that instead of helping out will instead call me everything but white and call into question my experience with computers.  So what will the future hold...who knows...I hope that Microsoft can reform and play a little nicer...but I doubt it. They are competitors, they know what they want and they have the cash to get it. In being that they have been ruthless in the business...but also they have driven the competition to be better. If you failed in a war with them it was because you fell behind. Adobe Photoshop is the tops in photo editing...not because Microsoft doesn't have photo editing software...but because Adobe's product is superior...by far.  For me when Longhorn hit I will install it...I will run it...I will learn it. It is the future...and the future looks good even from this very early operational beta.  What the fuck was that post about?

      Had a long talk with Jesse tonight...I must say dude got his shit together real fast.  I make no bones about being extremely reserved in my early thinking about what all he wants to do. I still have things that I need to resolve for myself...not about his plans or about how is going about getting things together...but they are for me to resolve in my mind.  One of them is just plain fear of having not ever done what we are planning. It is this fear that I have of failing at things so I often don't even try...just to avoid the possibility of things failing.  Jesse put into me tonight on the phone the fire and desire to see this through...regardless of what happens.  For a long time I have been a believer in one simple tennant for personal success...and that is you have to make it for yourself. Most of the people that have gone places have done so with nothing more than a wing and a prayer...and so many have come out on top.  Well I am going to step in to uncharted territory and throw my energy behind his vision...not because I am just saying it...or paying lip service...but indeed I do believe in what he...and we will be attempting to do.  Sure there is a risk of failure in it all...there are always risks...risk comes with rewards...without risk we would have nothing.  So over the next few days I will have to write a bio on myself for some of the plans...and I will have to get down to business in trying to make lucrative contacts around abouts for support and ideas.  Jesse has laid out his plan...and it is good. From where he has it now I believe that we can make the vision a reality...and what a reality it will be.  So the next few days I have to get into a mode that will allow me to build up my personality...or rather my personality on paper. The next few weeks I will have to gather information to help me prepare for the next steps. The next few months I have to prepare myself to make some personal changes that will allow me to see this all through...and part of those choices have to do with doing my damndest to get healthy as this venture will most assuredly be hard on the body...not so much in a bad way...but because I will have to be on my A game all the time to do what we need to do.  I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I will basically be like...look I have a lot coming up in the next few months...I need every drug that I can get my hands on to make myself healthy and still be able to function completely....give me the Anti-Biotic that makes me itchy...but in doing that get me pumped on the steroids and antihistamines as well...also get me something for the stiffness and general lack of energy that I have...get me performing at my peak so that I can throw all my energies at this venture.  This also means that I am going to have to hussle to get money together...which means I have to get off of my lazy ass and get some of this shit sold...save money...and just be ready to sprint into action when things are ready.  Jesse this goes out to you bro...I want to thank you for considering me in all this. I know that recently I have been dodgy about all of this. Yes it was because I had reservations...but I now believe in this with all my mind and heart...I am sure this is going to work. I am sure that we will be able to make this a go project. From this point on I am going to be that dude that is real, but is ready to run out into traffic and make things happen if it is needed. I am ready for this...you are ready for this. We have finally gotten to the points in our lives that we are ready to make things happen for ourselves and move on from our current positions.  Here's to the future...I tip my vodka tumbler. We are ready to go. Lets make this happen.

      It looks like the parts will be here on the 13th. YAY!  Tonight I saw my friend Carrie on Elimidate. Tonight was her nite to shine...and shine she did. Well sort of.  I love Carrie in the greatest way...I see her as the virginal girl that we all lust after...but with that side that you want...a dirty little secret side that only comes out in private...or at least that is what I think.  Well her Elimidate was just all wrong. Having been in the Pittsburgh area on and off over the past 6 years (all adult years...how weird) I rarely run across guys out there that are even somewhat intelligent.   Now I am not tooting my own horn...but I score very high on the IQ test...some tests I score in the 130's and in others up to 150. So I am by no means a dummy. However it seems that Pittsburgh is full of guys that are pretty much dumb as bricks...or celery...or whatever veggie you want to compare them too.  There were four guys on the show to win Carrie. The first was a Wrestling dude. He seemed a little different from the typical sort...he may not have been the brightest bulb on the tree...but he was at least somewhat coherant. Now as a guy that is comfortable in his sexuality this dude wasn't any great shakes in the looks department.  They had another dude on there that is in a Rockabilly Band here in the Burg. Unfortunately he may have been the most intelligent of the group...but the way the show was cut you maybe heard him say maybe a sentence or two. Plus my little Carrie didn't know what Rockabilly was.   Carrie...think of the Stray Cats...or rather think of Brian Setzer Orchestra (sp?) of "Jump, Jive, and Wail" fame...Brian was a founding member of the revival of Rockabilly in the Stray Cats. It is pretty good music that is catchy...a little bit nitchy...but hey it is musically better than most pop music. Download some of the Stray Cats...and you will get the jist of the beats that they use.  Now the next two guys were the "winners" of the pack. And I don't mean winner in a good way. First they are twins and between the two of them they may have enough brain matter to actually guide a rat through a maze...wait no strike that....they may have the combined brain power of your average orchid. I will give it to them in one way...they looked ok. Think of Oz from American Pie fame and you will get the idea.  Having known Carrie since she was a youngin...16...I have kinda seen her grow up over the years. She has turned out to be a beautiful woman and a great person. The show really didn't do her justice because of the editing.   Now here is where I need to get nasty about this whole affair. This is where I will go into a rant about women, men, and young people in general (including people in my own age group the mid-twenties).  I am getting rather tired of seeing pretty boys...(I'm no great shakes...but hell I ain't a dog). Pretty boys give all decent looking guys...and guys less than decent a real hard task to get anyone that we may desire. However what really gauls me is that these guys were just your typical wannabe frat boys...idiotic, dumb, retarded, and pack animals...not hunters but more like a gang of heinias (sp?). They really have no skill of talent of any sorts. Sure they will get through college (and finish unlike myself)..but it won't be because they are really all that bright...but because of the educational machine.   Now I will cast stones here. I am smart. I have spent a lot of time researching various topics and consider myself fairly informed on many subjects...and if you are lucky enough to meet me in person on a good day you will see that I am also a great orrator. I can take a subject that is hard to discuss and make it easy...not by dumbing it down to pander...but by bringing in lingo and jargon and explaining it to people...and I can add some humor to even the most boring or scary of topics. I take pride in the fact that I can get up in front of a group and give speeches that border on comedy...but it comes with a message. Very similar to Lewis Black (save the anger) and George Carlin (albeit without his vast knowledge of semantics and great command of the English language). I can take a subject and make it understandable. That is why I teach at my local library computer courses for the older people of the community. I always get compliments and have ended up with several clients from those sessions. Everytime I get up to be "the center of attention" I always make sure to include everyone and try to be accomodating to peoples needs. I need to please...that is my purpose.  I am also very good at debate...maybe that is where my other skills come from. I pride myself in being able to debate anything as long as I have some leadin to what the subject is...if it something I know a lot about then it will be a breeze to debate on that topic...if it is something I don't know much about then I attempt to educate myself about the topic. In doing this I take no position in the beginning. I look at facts and roll them into my own conclusions...that usually strikes a balance.  In having spent time honing these skills I have largely seperated myself from the social norms of my age range. Most of the people I know at my age are fairly settled...yet they are rather uninformed on many things. I have chosen to be a "geek" in the sense that I yearn for knowledge on things. I want to know all that I can and am always willing to listen to something new.  What has it gotten me? Well it hasn't made me the most popular person because it is hard to debate against people of my own age when I share little in common with them. Yeah sure I can kick back a few beers...or dozen...but I am not good a small talk. I have not honed that capability. Instead I have chosen to hone my skills in a more meaningful way. So I am rather dull at a party...unless I shred off my grown up attitude and become a kid and just have fun...which is hard for me to do right now with all that is wrong in the world.  Now wrapping it around to this Elimidate I found it disheartening that the future Men of America is not interested in anything further than they ends of their dicks. These boys (and no they weren't men) were out for ass...plain and simple. Is that wrong...hell no, but if you are gonna go out just to get ass do it with class at least. Don't be players...that is wrong. This crop of guys they chose were nothing short of the failings of our system.  Now I must focus on women. It is often said by women that they want: 1. A sensitive guy 2. A good looking guy 3. A smart guy 4. A good guy that treats them with respect 5. A non-player.  Now I know this because I hear it over and over again from my female friends...and they are all the ones who choose to go out with exactly the opposite of what they want. They end up getting treated like shit, then they cry about it to people like me. Don't get me wrong; I enjoy being there for my friends when they need support, but I am starting  to really get tired of the cliche'.  There are nice, funny, decent looking, smart, and considerate guys out there. Usually you are talking to one of them when things fall to shit. Those are the guys who are the catches out there...yet they are constantly overlooked for the pretty boy that will just use them for sex...or have the female as an accessory...much like a cool cell phone (I have one...and it is cool...but I don't need another cool thing to be hanging from me).  I have often said that I would give my left nut to be with some of the women that I console...and I would. Not because I want to bang them...(although being a guy and being programmed to breed through millenia of evolution sex would be great...but it is never nesecary to have that right off the bat)...instead I would just like to be that guy that they will look back on and say "jeesh he really was good to me and actually cared about me wholely and entirely."  That is what I want. I want someone who is my equal...a woman that can be intelligent, smart, beautiful, and sexy all rolled into one (as everyguy proffesses he wants..but in my case this is what I want)...I don't need eye candy...that is what internet porn is for when it comes down to it. I want someone who will complete me and fill that gap that I have.   Does this mean I am picky...yes to a degree...not really that much in the looks or sexy department...but I am extremely picky when it comes to the smarts of the person I want to spend time with.  I want to fawn over them...be there at their beck and call...yet I want the favor returned...I need for someone to bring me chicken soup when I am sick. I want someone who will be there when I am blue, but will let me be in that mood and not get mad because I don't snap out of it right away.  I am in a unique position I feel. I have CF...you can see it in the title. I will most likely die because of it. Actually I may die in a year...two years...who knows but I will die sooner rather than later at my current health decline rate. That puts me in a dilema of sorts...because I don't want for someone to become to attached because it would kill me to know that when I pass that person will have to mourn for me. That is worse than death to me.  That is part of why I don't actively seek a woman to share my life with.  Another reason and it is as plain as the nose on your face is that I don't have the energy to really persue anyone. I did that once and expent a lot of energy. I simply cannot do that..that puts my health at risk.  I want a comfortable relationship that when I pass it won't be so huge that anyone would be devastated...I would want to be remembered...but remembered in a good way as that I was good to people...and good to the people that I love and care for.  There is still someone who has my heart...and I don't give it freely...and it is only because she was my first love...and we all know what a bitch that is...you never can get rid of that first love.  I have room for another...and I would always be willing to entertain a new relationship with someone at anytime as long as I know what is expected up front.  I am not perfect...but I am not flawed...I am average and I just want to share myself and my life with someone.  I have one person that I would gladly invite back into my life at anytime and she knows it...I hope that would happen but I doubt that it would because I hurt her badly in the past...and yes I actually admit that it was my fault.  So Carrie...you know I love ya lots...I hope that you find someone that will be your equal...and know that I am always here.  Beth...you know that you are still engrained into me...you were there in the worst that I have been...and I greatly appreciate that. I would love to be together again...and of coarse you know that as well.  Will either of these things happen. I doubt it...but I can hope and dream can't I?  I just wanted to share this all and get it out there...because sometimes I find myself at a loss for words when in person...but I would ask that people look past the somewhat shy outer shell and see what is inside...because what is inside is beautiful...just like what I see in ya'll.  No this isn't a weirdo stalking thing...because while I of coarse care what you think...my life doesn't hinge on it...and regardless I will always be the same guy I have always been. A good decent young man.  On the finishing school thing..I would love too...and most people know that. Most people know that really all I lack are really about 30 credits to have several degrees...but I would hope that people would understand that at this point in my life I can't finish...my health won't allow for that no matter what happens...I would end up failing not on concept or knowledge...but on being there. That is why I haven't committed to finishing my degrees.  Here is what I could have if I applied my credits wisely and took some extra courses...BS in Computer Science, BA in History, BA in English, minors in GIS and Math. Its not that I don't know how to achieve these things...but it is because I physically can't do it. It would literally kill me.   This doesn't mean that I won't go places...I am working on that and have been working more and more. I am becoming rather succesfull in my own right. I work now, I have clients, and I have a growing base of knowledge from which I can make money. So while I failed at standard education...I have succeeded in life in my own small way.

      Dean chose to go with Private financing in his campaign by turning down 19 Million in public funds. So it is now for all of us (his supporters) to give a little to the campaign.  He made a very eloquant speech that can be seen on my link to DeanTV.   He sent out Emails to his supporters (about 30,000 votes were counted) to ask what he should do...and most people chose to go with Private funding of his campaign.  Now I am for campaign finance reform, but right now we are in a state of emergency. We need Bush out and Dean (or any democrat for that matter...and this coming from a registered Republican).   Bush turned down the public financing so that he could build a war-chest of about 200 million bucks to fight off a non-existant primary foe. So what will that money actually go towars...well he will be running smear campaigns to try and discredit any Democrat that may pose opposition to his re-election bid.  Right now Dean is at around 20 million for the primaries...if he chose public financing his total cap would have been 49 million or so to run his campaign on...that is hugely unfair.  all we need is 2 million people to contribute 100 bucks to the campaign to help him out. I will be giving 100 bucks for the primary and another 100 bucks for the general election if Dean is chosen to run.  You can see a link on my page here to go and give him some money. My total right now is 0...but I will be adding to it soon (like this month).  You can go give money and you will be credited with giving the money...so go do it...we can all spare 100 bucks over the next 10 months...or less. So I encourage you to vote with your dollars and help Dean become the next President of the USA.  Go ahead you know you want too :-)

       The internet is shit!   Funny site...well funny in that it is true. Oh so true.  What is the internet to you.  For me it is a vast expanse with little knowledge and lots of rumor flying around. I find it a great tool, yet a great waste of time. For me I cannot get off the internet because I do use it for much of my information gathering...but I also take whatever I read on it with a grain of salt just like I take any printed material...or any published material for that fact.  The truth is in the eye of the beholder.

      Well today has been pretty slow overall...we have done about a hundred in sales...give or take a few bucks...  We need to be making more...but ya know you can only trip so many people in a day...and you can only force them into wanting something that they don't need if they are in the mood to whip out the cash or credit card.  What really astounds me is how easily people pull out there credit cards to get shit. I mean whenever I pull out my credit card I feel guilty...usually because it is something that I don't have enough cash on me to afford...or something that I couldn't afford in the first place.  Like I placed my new phone on the credit card...240 bucks...no biggie really. I can pay that off in two weeks...and I have the money for it...but still I fealt guilty about putting the money on the card.  I paid my personal credit card today online...and that is good...just needed to get that out of the way...I have plenty left on it...not because it has a high limit but because I really don't put much on it. I put gas and bought some stuff online with it...but I got it paid down to only a few dollars of being paid off (in other words I will have it paid off in a month).  I guess I am lucky because I went through a really rough spot with credit cards...I had one that I ran up too about a thousand dollars...and I had family that helped me out...and in doing that I cut up all my cards and haven't had one in my own name for years...only about a month ago did I get one in my own name.  Now I have had a credit card attached to my grandmothers card...and that has a huge limit on it...but I haven't put anything on it (save for the phone) and last night we put about 640 bucks on it for computer stuff...of which my mom already gave her 500 towards it...now I just have to give her some money (for the phone and previous balance that I owe on it)...I have been pretty good with credit for a long time...in that I don't go out and spend mad amounts of money.   Everytime I want something I wait for a few days and debate it...usually I don't get it if I don't have the cash money for it...because I already know what it is to be in debt.  Overall not including my student loans (which will never get paid back) I owe around 6300 total (on my car and credit)..so I am in pretty good shape...oh not to mention my monthly phone bill which this month may be a little high.  I have made do with around 530 dollars a month for a long time now without really blowing loads of cash...granted I don't go anywhere...but at least I know that if I want to get something or go somewhere I have the credit available if I would like too...  Oh yeah and my house arrest...funny thing is that he didn't come back to put the anklet back on...instead he took the kit and cabootle with him...I just have to be in by 6PM (and really I am still technically on house arrest just without the anklet). He asked me if he could trust that I won't go running off or break the rules...which I won't run off...and as for rule breaking...I can never not do that...but I can adhere closely to them.  I think it came down to that I had it off almost a month because of going into the hospital...I think he just got tired of having to come out and do it every couple of weeks...plus it adds to their costs.  I should still be off of it by mid-December...only a few short weeks away.  Well my boss came by and I have a few things to do before the end of the evening...  Peace out ya'll.

Because there is a plethora of abnoxious twits walking around breaking shit...fondling things...some of these kids are the prime reasons that women should be allowed to have abortions...they didn't need to be here in the first place...  What is that addage...you will get children that are tens times worse than you when you were a kid...well if your were one of those children that people didn't like...then if you get knocked up...do humanity a favor...vacuum that puppy out of there. We don't need a bunch of little souless kids walking around making the world a more miserable place.  Fuck I hate kids...

      New obscene laws about to be passed by the government...this is why I constantly harp on Free Speech and the rest of the bill of rights.   Why oh why?   Op/Ed piece...scary stuff   I believe in the bill of rights as it was originally drafted...and I agree with most of the amendments to it as well.  We have the right to free speech...it is there to protect speech that some of us may find questionable. That is the beauty of this bit of law. It is also why it is first. Without it there can be no public discourse or debate on anything...the founding fathers realized that and made sure that we can say what we want when we want. It also makes the separation of church and state sacrosanct. Their fear was that if the government pimped a particular religion than that would effectively close down free speech, free press, and all of the things that they were fighting for.  We have the right to keep and bear arms and maintain a well regulated militia. The idea behind this was to say that the people could organize in active opposition to the government if the government was to get out of control. They could not foresee the problems that people have with this. Nonetheless they have it in there. So I believe that if you are a citizen of the US then you are allowed to own any type of weapon you want...even a howitzer. They made it so other laws would be enforced if you chose to abuse this right by indiscriminate killing people...hence the oenal code. If you want to hunt a deer with an M-16 then so be it...just don't shoot up the local school yard. Banning all weapons for private ownership and use only hurts us...and here is why...because the people must have the option of rising against the government in times when the government runs amok (much like it is now).  No soldier shall be quartered in a private residence unless in times of war and only with good reason. This stems from the fact that the British military would often come in and take your house and use it as a base of operations in an area. It applies now moreso then ever in my opinion. We have seen the military come into areas and taking over in the name of "the law"...examples include Waco and Ruby Ridge...having the military being able to take your house is saying that the government can turn our forces against us the people.  Search and Seizure...basically laid out to make sure that a police or military force can't just come into your house and look for stuff. This right has been nearly stripped from us...moreso than the right to bear arms...cops nowadays simply pull you over and they have probable cause and search your car. Whenever I have been pulled over I have almost always refused them a search of my car and call them on it when they shine a flashlite into my backseat saying that they can't do that. This right has been the most eviscerate of them all. Also it covers re-imbursement for property that has been commandeered...when was the last time you got a check for Los Alamos? They took the land and never re-imbursed the people for that land.  The Fifth amendment takes a big bite of many things...basically saying that you cannot be charged with a crime by one person or on that persons authority...that they have to get an indictment...it too has been eviscerate through the use of closed door grand juries. It also makes it a right to "plead the fifth" so that you are protected from implicating yourself...again it has become distorted by many in the corporate world...what do you think when you hear someone take the fifth...you think "GUILTY AS CHARGED"...it is ashame because it really only means that you don't want to tell anyone what you know or don't know.  Six is the right to a speedy trial and due process. Pretty obvious here...but lately it has gotten out of hand. Everyone who steps foot in this country is protected by it...but under the current administration and Patriot Act we can now be thrown in jail without due process or a trial...it was to try and prevent one person from becoming to powerful and locking up opponents.  Double jeopardy is the next one basically. This right has been upheld all the time...and it is one of the few that still works well. It only works well because of the rich constantly asserting it for crimes they have done...if it were only poor people being dragged through the system then this right would surely have been rescinded. Trial by jury is also included to make sure that the people have a say in the system.  Fair Punishment and fair Bail...well this one is obviously gone...ask any young black man who sells pot on the corner. They get long sentences and huge fines, plus they rarely get fair bail. This is one of the ones that applies conversely to your wealth...the richer you are the less you have to pay for your crimes.  Nine touches on the fact that the rights cannot be denied to anyone...and was later strengthened by including minorities and women. It says that the law can't be changed willy nilly.  Ten asserts states rights. Basically ceding federal law to state and local law...the foresaw that they couldn't make plans for all contingencies...so they gave the states flexibility to shape laws how they saw fit as long as those laws didn't interfere with the Bill of Rights. However notice lately in the debate over medical marijuana the Federal Government is trying to enforce its views over the states...it was put in the bill of rights to allow citizens to make up their own law for their communities without being bound to a slower moving federal government.  That is your quick lesson in the Bill of Rights.  Hopefully you learned something. You should because these rights are under attack from all sides by the Bush Administration. Fight for them.  For the people who want to take away gun rights I challenge you to prove that if private ownership was banned tomorrow crime would go down. The laws on the books already make it illegal for felons to own weapons. The laws that are in place now only interfere with a person who is obtaining weapons legally...the criminals will still get them regardless...plus if you are for banning weapons then you are probably liberal...and you should be fighting to keep the right because of the current way things are going...it may come down to an armed conflict between the government and the people...if we don't have the tools to fight them then we would loose and things would be much worse...a little revolution now and again isn't always a bad thing.  So read up and become informed of your rights...Exercise them daily. Use them often. Make them your own. If you don't then in a few years when they are all gone you will find yourself in a world of hurt.  Does this mean Mike that you oppose gun control? No actually I don't oppose it...I think some controls are fine. You should have to wait for a weapon so that checks can be done...but when it comes down to brasstacks you see that the current controls really don't filter out the people that go buy a gun then shoot others up...because obviously if they obtained the gun legally the person was found to not be a threat. You can't regulate anger or behavior...so don't try to. We have to accept that there will be gun deaths...but we can make sure that the most egregious acts that are committed are punished to the fullest extent of the law.  That is all for tonight...I will step down from my stump now :-)

      As you can see I updated the look of the blog...and I got everything moved into this template...finally.  I am learning HTML and stuff on the fly here. I am glad that I can figure it all out.  Just got off the phone with Jesse...and he will be coming out this next week...hella sweet. We have a lot of paperwork to go over and get done.  I promised more about Danielle...but I am very tired. I will be getting some rest now.   Peace, Love, Unity, Respect.

      I am glad that I am home...it is good to be back in my little room with the fat internet connection...hehehehe  Well I got the heatsink/fan unit for my system....got a thermaltake and it is a little whiney...but it keeps the system cool. I also got some Arctic Silver 3...and I got a new keyboard mouse combo that I have had my eye on for a while...the MS Cordless Elite Pro Optical or whatever the hell it is...  Normally it is 99 bucks...but CompUSA had an instant rebate on it...well they did for a few days but neglected to take the sign down...so I got the rebate four days after it expired...and I got the setup for a total of 79 bucks...the keyboard is really responsive and the mouse is as well...it has the second axis on the wheel so you can scroll horizontally as well..that is nifty and I will use that a lot in gaming (assign it as straif or something)....overall I would rate them both together as pretty good...better than the Logitech setup I had before (which was wireless) and more convieniant than the wired setup I ripped off of here to upgrade to this setup...  Only time will tell.  I got to visit a lot with Danielle today and it was just the bomb. I really enjoy talking to her as she is very bright...and seeing that we are in the same boat (well hers has more water in it right now...my boat just got a new bucket to bail out with it would seem) it is nice to be able to talk to someone else and be actually able to relate to them. It makes me miss Melinda a lot...I wish she were still around...she really did help me during that time that I knew her.  I am honored to get to know a bit about Danielle...we talked a lot about relationships today and how they apply to us. We have come to similar conclusions on it all...We would really love to be in a healthy relationship...but it helps if you are healthy. We both want them...but at the same time shy away because of what goes on in our lives...her reasoning I suspect is similar to mine...and mine is that I really don't want to drag anyone down my path with me...because that when I do die I don't want to have that person mourn me...that is simple. It would be selfish to enter into a relationship for me at this point knowing that in all probability I will be dead or very near dead in a few years time. That is selfish...to me at least.  Well I am tired...and I will give a better account when I get some sleep.  I will post more of my time with Danielle tomorrow. Again it was really fun and I enjoyed talking to her. We also talked a little bit about politics...and she is also a Registered Republican...after I get done with her she will be most decidedly opposing the Republicans because it will be easy to show what all is wrong there...I may even wrestle her away from the Dems as well because all in all they aren't much better than the republicans...  Fight the power...learn the jargon...fight them on their level because you can never elevate them to our levels...its time to get dirty and take it to the street!

      Woohoooo!!! Never a dull moment over here. I am getting out today. So never mind that I thought I would be here another day or so...Dr. Weinberg is kicken me out....that is so good cause I gots a lot to do. I have to run to the bank, run to the computer store to pick up a HSF for my P4 at home...and get some heat sink gew...I will head over to Comp-USA to get that stuff...they have gotten quite a few things in that are of decent quality.   My computer runs ok...but it does run a little warm considering that the processor is hella overclocked right now...I mean the sucker is running at what almost a gigahertz over stock speed...but the temps have risen only a little bit...normally the processor was running around 45C in this mini boxes...now it is running up to 52C...also the voltage is only slightly up since I moved from my old Shuttle to the new system that I got...actually the voltage is down from the Shuttle (it was 1.62V in that) and now is running at 1.575V in the current system. That makes me happy...and now I just need to shed a little heat off of the processor...so maybe the fans can spin a little quieter...and the box run a little cooler.  Over all the system is currently running at ballz out blazing speeds...the only thing that I really need to do is change out to SATA hard drives and maybe a new Video Card...and that thing will be screaming...I want to get one of the SATA Raptor 10,000RPM 72GB hard drives as my primary drive...and then get a 250GB plus SATA drive for my backup and data drive...then I will need to get a few external HD cases to hook into the USB ports so I can keep the 120gigs of space (plus another 40gig drive that has no home)...My goal is to have around 500gigs of space on my box available at anytime...cause I have a friend that has about a thousand CDs that I want to rip over to MP3...she has already given me the approval to do that...plus if I get a new laptop and were to bring that mega-box up here with 500+ gigs of space I could rip all those CD's two or three at a time and get through the CDs in just a few days...  Oh yeah in my main box I have a TDK Indio 8X DVD+-RW Drive...and a TDK 48X CD-RW Burner (when I get those SATA drives in there I will be able to put both drives on independant PATA channels allowing for independant burning and ripping without slowdowns...heheheh). The DVD+-RW Drive also burns CD at 40X...so it is a bad ass burner to be sure!  Well I have some food here and I need to get my stank ass cleaned up so I can jet out....  Love to all that sent love to me while I was away....I will be back home later this evening. The only thing that I need to do really is just get a few things in order and all will be will.  Peace out...fight the power. Listen to Democracy NOW! With Amy Goodman...link in my political links section.

      Well this morning has aleady been busy. First I woke up to the lovely Missy and her pipes of perfection....well by that I mean that she had all my treatments for me. That went well.  Then I went down to get my PFT's done. Well the first two were predictably bad but the third one was very good...but in doing that I heard something pop in my lung and now it kinda hurts over there...oh well. One good number for the road at least.  Yesterday I went down to the Vascular Lab where they do Angioplasties and such in this hospital (I think the Department is ENG Labs). Well they fiddled with my port and got it to work without much in the way of pain...they didn't need to dig into my chest (thank goodness)...I was really worried that they would have to replace the damn thing. However the Queen of Ports (related to the Queen of Hearts as she works on hearts too ;-) got in there and did something and got me all fixed up. She basically jiggled it around in the port and whatever clot essentially broke free and went whizzing down the tube into me...that felt weird. Then they ended up replacing the port needle...or reaccessed it. That was good...and they now it works just peachy keen.  I love being in the hospital...not because I like being here but because I just like being able to have what I need when I need it. They come in and make me do the treatments and then beat me...it just is so easy. When I am at home it is hard to keep up with all the things that I need to do because there is just so much of it.   Well I have a CT scan that they are going to do later on to take a look and see what my lungs look like and see if they can figure out why my heart is all goofy. I am just thinking that basically it is because I have all these anti-biotics in me and they are essentially hurting my heart. All the meds go directly into the heart through the Port. So I would imagine after a bit the heart would get a little tired of the insult of cold meds hitting it and with some of the meds (like Azactam and Zosyn, and others) that basically I am allergic too I would imagine that the heart is just not happy with those things going into it. It is becoming damaged to a degree.  Some of the drugs that I take basically make me numb and a little goofy. So I think that may be almost retarding my heart rythm a little...and that may be why my heart feels heavy.  So....I just don't know what is up.  I am going to try and get pics of the people here today because I may be leaving tomorrow with any luck...I say tomorrow because they still have to do a CT and get that looked at by a pro...then I have to wait for the Doc to look at it and see what he thinks.   I just love the people up here. I really enjoy being around these people...because they are nice and just do what they are supposed to. Plus a lot of them I have grown fond of because I see them a lot.  Well I am going to get a little nap then I am going to be doing a little paper work. I have a lot to write today and some charts and graphs...hopefully I have all the software on here.   Oh yeah and there is a female here that is a hottie...woah momma...she was here the last time I was here...and she is even hotter this time. Perhaps it is because I am getting on up there in the celebacy level....not chosen mind you...forced because of circumstances (like not really having gotten out to meet the locals and perhaps just not really wanting another distraction in my life)...but now the urges that we all have are coming back (perhaps because I am feeling a little better) but regardless I am feeling a little better.  Although I just stood up and got itchy...eek!!!  Well lemme get some benedryl out of these people. Then I can get things on the road...  Talk to you later. Remember yesterdays posts powered by Sleep Deprevation and lunacy...todays may be even better as I go over what all I said.  Oh lord I have a feeling today may be an interesting day....and oh yeah I have decided that somehow over the next month or so once I get this thing under way I am going to have to get a real laptop...cause this thing is just ghetto...really....It is four years old and beaten all to hell. I am sure that many parts are worn out...and parts of my screen are not as bright as they should be....and somewhat pixelated. Yeah I think I am going to be shopping for a new notebook....I want to get a Centrino laptop with a Radeon 9600 and some extras....that is what I want...and somehow I will get that hooked up.  Peace...remember change the world...make bold step. resist the powers that be.

      Well today was just a long day. I really didn't get all that much sleep overall. I maybe have had a combined 4 hours of sleep over the past 60 hours or so...because I really didn't sleep at all on Sunday night...my chest was hurting pretty bad and that was the beginning of this all. Monday I didn't sleep but maybe an hour throughout the day...just enough for quick nap.  I of course didn't sleep last night...well because I wasn't in a place that I could really sleep...now I have a room and I am pretty tired so I am most sure to be dying here pretty soon....actually I am so close to falling asleep right here at the keyboard....jessh!  Well maybe tomorrow update will be a little bit more up to par...I mean lemme just say that these posts today were pretty far out there...not because I don't think that way...indeed I do...but normally I have a little better filter on my brain. Today that filter was forceably removed by drugs and sleep deprevation.  goodnight all and I will talk to you tommorrow what I am a little bit better off....  Peace love and change the world....fight the power!

      Here is something that caught my wrath in the last few minutes. The hacker of Al-Jazeera basically got a slap on the wrist for his stunt.   CNN Story on Al-Jazeera Hacker   Now riddle me this....if I had taken down CNN and redirected all their traffic to a porn site...or worse just took it off the air for a few days...what would happen to me? Would I get a slap on the wrist? Or would the corporate lawyers at AOL-TimeWarner grind my frail body into the ground after the judge sentenced me to at least a year in jail with possibly an extension for the Patriot Act of up to ten years.  So I imagine some of you are wondering what this is all about.  I don't know yet...but I feel a fucking revolution coming on...even if I have to go out and make it happen.  Revolt, revolve, re-constitute, change it for the better...  Oh yeah and I fucking hate being in this room right now...I just want to get the fuck out of here.

      It is all fucked up right now. They have me in a room with another person and I can't even be nice.   I want to be in a private fucking room right the fuck now. CF patients are almost always kept away from the other patients partly because we tend to be foul tempered...but mostly because we are already walking a thin fucking line if we are in the hospital in the first place. I am on a razor thin line...my bugs are already getting the best of the doctors and  I know that I can't handle another infection of anything right now.  My port is most definitely stopped up. They will have to surgically remove it. Then they will have to surgically put a new one in. So I have two major things right off the bat that I have to deal with. I bet they won't get to it tomorrow because if they were smart and planning anything they would have me fasting now...instead it is just all fucked up.  I dunno what I am gonna do. I am pissed. I am tired. I am sick of being sick...and now I am in danger...this isn't right!

      Hey I had a post here...where did it go...damnit!!!!  Well I am down at the hospital now...I had to wait almost four hours before I could get into the emergency room...I hate having to come in through here.   I hate having to type all this again.  The ER really is broken in most places...here is a fine example. Really did I need to come into the ER...no...but there should be a better way for me to get into the hospital in the middle of the night.   The ER is for emergencies...but here it is used as a primary care facility. That is what is wrong here with our system. We have people that should be going to doctors...but instead they can't because they have no insurance...instead they have to fall onto the ER...so it is broken. The time has long since passed to move us over into a national health care system...it is for the good of all to have one.  The only people who benefit from this mess we call health care right now are the insurance companies and their managers...they are the only one making any money on it all...the doctors aren't...why because they have to pay insurance companies to protect them from malpratice lawsuits...while on the other end you have insurance companies forcing doctors to not treat with the most effective treatments causing harm to people...and what do those patients do...they turn around and sue...  The only people making any money are the insurance companies...and that is just as clear as all the blood on their hands.  I call for everyone to rise up and defeat this monster...it is so easy...it really is right there for us to just do. Instead we let Democrats and Republicans divide us on the issue as to which will be better...instead we should be giving the system over to the doctors and asking them what would be best. They would know...they are doctors...their primary goal is to treat patients.  The whole system is a mess...we can fix it. Republicans won't fix it because they are making money off of it being broken, the Democrats won't fix it because they use it to strike fear into people and keep us coming back to them for a fix...when indeed most of them are just nothing more than pushers of a quick fix.  I fear that no one has the balls to stand up and say this simple thing. We need to fix it. We need to Socialize it! We need to demand as taxpayers and as humans that Medical Care is a Human Right!  Fight the power...change the world...start a movement...  Oh yeah and I love having this wireless internet on my phone :-)  I get 315kbps over it...well above ISDN...about half that of a medium DSL line...not bad at all :-)  Fight fight fight fight...make the world better. Only we can do it!

      Hey all...well I should be at work right now, however I am not. After I went to bed early this morning and while I was asleep my port decided that it wanted to go ahead and clog up. Oh the joy!  Right now I am experiencing much discomfort from it. It feels like I have a large weight on my heart...my heart feels like it is being squeezed into a little box and every heartbeat is beating against the box. Breathing is hard...and very labored. If feels like I have something in the left side of my chest over there that is sitting on the lung and heart...it feels almost fluid like because it doesn't compress at all...instead it just exerts much pressure.  The nurse will be here by 4PM to try and get the line unblocked...I hope she can do it because if she can't get it opened up I will have to go to the hospital and have this port removed and another put in...oh joy!  I just feel like shit...my kidneys hurt, my liver is hard, it feels like I am breathing with a large weight on the one side of my chest...something is flat our wrong folks...very wrong.

      A letter that I have sent to my Senators from PA.  ------------------------------------------------ With the recent bruhaha over a Prescription Drug Program being offered by Medicare I have found myself in a dilehma of sorts.   I do think that health care for all should be enacted immediatly. A national health care initiative is the only solution to the current crisis, and to be sure it is a crises when we have 40-60 million Americans without any type of Health Care coverage.   The plain truth is that while they can get health care it usually ends up on the taxpayers bill regardless and with the recent push to "privatize" medicare and prescription drug programs I feel that this will definitely bankrupt the system and leave millions more with less than competative coverage or no coverage at all.  Why am I concerned about this issue? Because I benefit directly from it. I am 26 year old with Cystic Fibrosis and I depend on Medicare and state programs to cover my medical care. I am not alone as most CF patients are in a similar situation. As the private system now stands if I were to even be covered by any insurer I would have an exclusionary period of a minimum of two to a maximum of five years before any private insurer would even consider picking up the health care cost.  If you are not familiar with CF it is a very expensive condition to treat. In this past year alone I have racked up around 300,000 in hospitalization and drug costs. Under the current system I am covered and could want for nothing. Under the new system that is being pushed by your coleagues in the Senate I fear that I would be left without any coverage as you want to push people off of the public system onto a private system. If this goes through I, like many others, will end up with no coverage because of the exclusionary periods.   I can't wait for up to five years before any benefits would kick in from a private insurer.  As a Christian you should be fighting for a national health care system period.   It plainly states in the Bible that we are to take care of the ederly and infirmed. There is no question on this. If you are opposed to these ideals than you may need to re-think your stance on being a Christian...as no self respecting Christion would even dare to suggest that we let out old and sick just die off instead of extending a helping hand.  From the initial sneek peek of this program there would be large gaps in coverage and many people would simply not be able to afford health care. Which will make them have to choose between their medication or food or a roof over their heads. That is simply un-Christianlike.   So I call for you to make a moral stand on the principles that you have publicly spoken. I call for you to propose a sweeping national health care initiative that will cover every American...regardless of their socio-economic status.  With CF I have had to make hard choices. One of those choices has to forgo trying to get a well paying job to help and pay taxes. If I were to get a high paying job, or even a decent paying job, the benefits that I depend on simply vanish because I am working. I would love to work and add to the common good, however under the current system that is not possible.   Again I call for you to take a moral stand against this prescription drug benefit plan and instead call for a national health care plan that covers every person in the United States.  It is the Christian thing to do, it is the Patriotic thing to do. It is the duty of a moral and just society to provide health care to all. ------------------------------------------------  I challenge all of you out there to write similar emails and letters to your representatives. It is the only way to make your views known!

      Today was an interesting day I will tell you. Actually it wasn't a very interesting day...I lied.  I woke up, did some drugs (not any fun ones), drove to work (that was OK cause I rocked Fatboy Slim all the way), got some Mcdees lovin (mmm steak bagel), got to the mall, opened the kiosk, and started selling almost immediately...today it was pretty busy...we did about 350 in sales (which is better than almost all the Sundays I have worked combined...but people are out buying for Christmas now), my boss was there (and I love her dearly but she makes me insane with her nervousness), I did more drugs, I didn't get to eat lunch because it was busy, I did more drugs, I stood around for about a total of an hour (not actually doing anything), talked to the Jews (remember I work next to Israeli's).  I am still trying to figure the one girl out...her name is Galit (I remember her name because it is so close to Galil an Israeli weapons manufacturer). I would definitely bang her...I mean she is certainly hot...but I don't know how we would communicate outside of random grunts and moans...her English isn't the best...actually the Indians (India Indians) speak better English...no surprise there as that is India's primary business language...  The last couple of days I have felt particularly sexy...I dunno what it is...probably the steroids...but I feel sexy. I am still self conscious but not nearly as bad as I usually am....its almost as if a switch was flipped and I am no longer a little boy...strange. So now all I need to do is just get some game and I am sure that I could have most any woman that I wanted...  I am finally comfortable (or reasonably so) in my skin...I am skinny...which most people wanna be (I would love to gain weight), I know I am smart...not because I am arogant but because I am indeed smart (at least I have something going for me), and I don't think I am dog shit ugly soooo...hey I am not in a bad shape. I think women are noticing me a little more. There are several A&F females that stare at me like they see me as a piece of meat...hey thats kewl...and then I have Galit...I know she is attracted to me it is painfully obvious...but I don't know about how to make a move.  Overall I am starting to get happy in my life...well not so much happy but content that I am me and I can't change it.  The next thing that I have to do in my life outside of getting ready for this project with Jesse is that I have to do some Biblical, Tora, Quran studying...I want to talk to the three religions that are in a horn lock right now and try to make some sense of it all.   I have so many views that really do come from a place of desperation as a believer in a higher power. I don't expect anyone to convert to my views...I just want them to analyze their own views and pratice what they teach/preach/spew...It is time for the moderates to come out and take back religion. The big three have been stolen from people by radical fundamentalists. Christianity has the Baptists and many other wacko forms, Judaism has been hijacked for years by Zionists, and Islam has been taken by force from the far right in their factions to spew hate towards all others (even themselves).  Why do I say this and why do I believe it to be true? Look at the recent comments by Pat Robertson on the Christian side...he was asking for people to pray that some of our most respected Supreme Court Judges be struck down by illness because they support a womans right to choose...that is absolutely wrong. Look at Judge Moore (well former Judge)...he was bringing religion into the courtroom asking for people to pass judgement on people from a religious stance (not unlike many of those supposedly evil nations that have Muslim governments and law)...  You have Sheron...he is a fucking lunatic...and all of the Zionists are just evil...and yes they are evil. They are literally killing their BROTHERS AND SISTERS!!!! The Palestinians are decendants of the Cainanites...which come from Cain...of Cain and Able fame (brothers...Able went on to be a founding Jew)...and recent archeological finds show that Cainanites and Early JEWS lived together...the Jews left the cities for the countryside to get back to a simpler life a couple of thousand years ago...mitochondrial DNA proves that they are related...every damn one of them! They are killing their brothers and sisters. That is just plain wrong.  You have the Mullahs and their flocks in Islam...that spew nothing even remotely masked as fear and hatred towards others. It is all rather rediculous.  All of the tenants of those religions are exactly the same...(the Muslims and Jews actually are better at taking care of each other and stay closer to some of the tenants of their religions as where the Christians have pretty much all but left taking care of their fellow man behind as a novel Idea)...  What are the Tenants? Love one another as you would love yourself, take care of your infirmed and elderly, and show love towards the other religions in the hopes that you would bring each other over to the other side...oh yeah and that God loves everyone.  Do we hear that anymore...well we hear God Loves us...but then we hear right after that...God hates the others and only if you prescribe to one religion will you be let into heaven...  I just don't know...I want to put together a presentation that I can give to anyone who is a religious zealot and at least plant the seed that what they are doing is actually against their religion...and that they need to return to the basics if they ever want to move forward.  I have a lofty goal of bringing peace...but in a more realistic reach I would just want them to critically analyze where they are at...and have them stand up to the bullies that have pushed these religions to polar opposites of what they are really about. That is all.  Well I have to get up in the morning and I am tired...I have a lot of reading and writing to do...  Love each other...be tolerant...and drop the hate, forgive each other, drop the hate.

      Another long day...I worked today...my boss needed for me to come in and help out so I did so willingly. Hey I was getting paid....and cash is good. Especially seeing that I need some to buy things like gifts for Christmas and shit.  I talked to my sis a long time tonight...I love talking to her...sure we don't agree on many things...but we are brother/sister so we get along pretty well overall. Actually we get a long a lot better than most of the brother/sister pairs out there. She is really an amazing woman...she is about to graduate from Vet School...and she will have completed the entire body of learning early (although she has to wait to graduate with her class...in the meantime she will be doing externships)...not only did she really get finished early she was also accepted to MSU's College of Veterinary Medicine on the first shot (it is not uncommon for people to apply two or three time before they get accepted)...so as that she started into vet school pretty early.  She really makes me proud...and I love my sister a lot.  Well I am tired and I am not feeling that red hot...I guess I am just worn down. My kidneys and liver hurt a lot...but I would imagine that is because I am on FIVE seperate Anti-Biotics and a coarse of steroids...not to mention the other things that I have to take each day...so I know why they hurt...I just wish they would stop hurting...probably the worst part about all of this is that my eyes are watering...like I am having some sort of alergic reaction....but I can't be because I am on the Steroids and high doses of Benedryl...so it can't be....it sucks because it makes my eyes really sensitive...I am sitting here squinting at the screen...because it is so damn bright!!!!  Well I am going to get some sleep....got all the computers up and running which is a good thing. I also got Norton Systemworks 2004 Pro today and got it all installed on my machine...crispy indeed.  Goodnight all :-)

      Today was an extremely busy day...we did 1299.81 in sales (not including tax)...so that wasn't to shabby at all. In not being shabby though you end up pretty much getting to the point of strangling the next innocent passerby.  It was a long hard slog at work today...I'll just put it at that.  On my way home (I was taking my time as the roads are starting to slick up...and I just needed to release some tension) I get a call from my grandmother. Apparently I am not old enough to be able to handle situations or something because god forbid I am late in getting home...or there is traffic...there must have been an accident...oh god he's dead in a ditch...my cancer markers are up...blah blah blah...  Well she called to check up on me on the way home because it was like 10:50...mind you it takes an hour to get out to where I work so I wasn't even late...jeesh.  I get here and I am barely in the door and she has crawled right up my ass with rapid fire question and answers session...I just answered simply and plainly as I am fucking tired...tired!  I get my food heated up...and she has her nose in it asking what it was...but she looked at it...what does it look like...hmm chicken...and it smells like chicken...wow it must be chicken. The other half was in the refigerator in a styrofoam box...and jee I guess it could be something I brought home...I dunno...she no longer has the capacity to do even simple problem solving...or maybe she is just dumb about that kind of thing.  I am tired and I want to relax...but instead she is crawling up my ass for all sorts of stories or whatever the hell she expects...  There was a message on the phone for me from the nurse...nothing big. I already knew what it said...so it wasn't a big deal...while I am just starting to eat she starts handing me the phone to get the message...so I stop what I am doing and I go out and get the cordless and get the friggin message...lo and behold it was nothing important.  I sit down again to try and eat...she tells me about Springdale not winning in football tonight...ok I don't care. It doesn't interest me...so when I just shrug she gets huffy and starts in on me...about she should just be quiet and this and that...yes you should I have been working in a loud place all day...I have a headache...and I am sick. It doesn't take a friggin genious to figure out that possibly I would want a few minutes without being harrased by anyone...including and especially her!  Then she gets up and starts tromping out saying something and I just wring my hands and shake...because if I didn't do that I would have punched her...I would have...she took offense to that...and started screeming at me...at that point I know that I probably shouldn't have wrung my hand and shook like that...but what the fuck...leave me in peace for just three minutes...please. She screemed and stomped off...I still don't give a flying fuck. I hope she sleeps poorly tonight realizing that she was acting like a three year old going "hey hey ...wanna see what I can do...hey hey...what about a bunny"...  What do you do? I mean I just don't know...I can't say anything because it will be wrong...I can't not say anything and just be quiet and that is wrong. She pulled that old lady crap yesterday when my mom was down for thanksgiving.  Moms back is screwed up...she was thinking out loud and was saying to the dog..."I wish you would walk on my back Rufus"...GM replies blythly with"I can do it"...mom just said to her "no that would probably not be good...I could just see you falling off and breaking a hip...imagine how I would explain that to the doctors...naaa better not mom"  I got a laugh out of it...my mom got a laugh out of it...it wasn't meant to offend...it was funny. GM took offense to it. Then made it plainly clear that she did...and attempted to belittle my mom.  Lately things like this have been cropping up more and more with her. It is getting to the point where she has reverted in many ways to a child like state.   At thanksgiving dinner at our friends..close friends that know how she is...she didn't have much nice to say to anyone...they shrug it off as her being "Betty Lou"...and that isn't right. I was always taught by my mother...which my mother was taught by her mother...that if you don't have anything nice to say...don't say anything. Simple...plain...to the point. However GM has forgotten that lesson that she ultimately bestowed on me.  Part of the problem right now is her cancer markers have jumped up again yet they can't seem to find any cancer in her. Now cancer markers aren't the be-all and end-all of cancer detection...they are like pointers and other things can actually trigger the same rise in marker levels...in other words the cancer markers aren't the most reliable test...but a good place to start.  Now she has already been through cancer twice now. Bad times indeed...but she made it...and frankly she didn't suffer much from it...she has a little pain now and again but instead of just getting something for it she would rather complaign and make herself out to be the person who needs pity or something.  This time around...it could possibly be bone cancer...and you can't do anything about that...simple. I know she is afraid...I know she doesn't want to die...but shit come on...there are somethings that you just can't control. Cancer is one of the millions of things that you can't control.  I feel bad for her...but the pity well dried up long ago. I will help her in anyway possible...I will be there as I have always been. I will do everything that is expected of me plus some...but don't demand pity. I am not in a giving mood...and pity is for the weak.  Face up to your disease with honor and pride. Own it...make it yours. Do not try and pass it off to others so they can share the load...  Just shut up and deal. Ok..simple!  I am sure tomorrow will be an interesting day as my mom will be up...and I will hear the same line "just be patient with her"...well I am being that...really patient...with the meds that I am on...it is nearly impossible to be patient because the steroids make me into a raving lunatic...but I have been handling her with kid gloves. I have been as careful as I possibly can be so as not to offend her. Aparently I need to work on it...because me just being quiet and out of the way is wrong...as usual.  I just need a break. She wonders why I don't want her to come to the hospital when I am in...because when she does it is all about her being there...and god forbid anyone ask her how she is doing...because you know she is a cancer victim...not a survivor...a victim.  Walk one day in my shoes there GM...you would gladly go back to your own pair...because at least you have lived a life...life before cancer...I have never had that chance. I have always had CF...and I always will. CF will kill me...and probably more likely to kill me than cancer will get her.   I love her...I really do...but she is just irritating the hell out of me...and there is nothing that I can do right...so it makes it worse.  Also I did warn her...I told her that the meds make me nuts...please be considerate enough to understand that incesant questioning and crawling up my ass about a letter on the table puts me that much closer to snapping.  Boy I love my "zero to rage in four hours" pills...also known as prednisone.  Goodnight all.

      Ummm what was that previous post? I sure as hell don't know. I was punchy this morning...but I don't think I was that bad off....oh dear baby jesus fetus....  I wanna say this...I love C-Span...I mean it really is a national treasure that unfortunately most people don't know about...or really know what it is. Find it on your cable dial...and watch it sometime. You will find that it really is the only "free" speech out there...it is unscripted...no news anchors...instead you get a feed from the House or the Senate...or you get a taping of a national book club meeting...no topic to dull for them to cover...their motto should be "More information than we know what to do with"...or..."Need a nap...don't watch us...cause we're interesting".  Ok well its not like that, but the channels cover so much.  Tonight I watched on C-Span1 a debate that was held on Oct. 25, 2003 at Regent University...the topic "Constitutional Judicial Activism".  The panelists ranged from well qualified to downright insipid. Here was the lineup.   Nadine Strossen - ALCU President Barry Lynn - Americans United for the Seperation of Church & State. Executive Director. Alan Dershowitz - Havard Law Proffessor Jay Sekulow - American Center for Law & Justice Chief Counsil David Limbaugh - Writer, pundit, retard Ann Coulter - Writer (HA!), pundit (Double HA!), whore, retard, skeletor, slut, bitch, cuntrag, oh what else...uneducated talking head.  Ok...so now that we have introduced out cast of characters (some woman from CourtTV was the moderator...no it wasn't that other cunt that is on Larry King Live all the time...she is a bitch of another caliber) let us get down to brass tax here.  Basically the debate was over whether or not the Supreme Court has been meddling in politics and taking political stances and not necesarilly legal views. Well the answer to this is really loaded...and it all depends on which side of the fence you sit on with a particular issue.   Take for instance abortion. The constitution (and I have to give the conservatives a little credit on this one) says nothing about it. It doesn't protect nor deny it...it just never mentions it...probably because it was before it really was an issue.  The argument on the side of the conservative now (it has changed so many times from murder, to morally wrong, to plain out religious hatred) is that the Judges should never have ruled on Roe v Wade in the first place because the court (which I happen to agree with) is only supposed to rule or even hear constitutional arguments...in other words it is only there for the constitution and nothing else. I agree with that.  However in the case of Roe v. Wade it was a constitutional issue as it was framed in a lawsuit because it specifically challenged a state law that limited private choice and freedom. To me that is simple. The court did need to weigh in on the issue.   By the way...if you want to know. I am PRO CHOICE!!!! It is in line with my beliefs very easily...and here is why. We all have the choice to do good or bad. I personally wouldn't have an abortion if I was a female...but I am not so I don't have to make the choice...but that does not mean that I should be able to impose my morals or views on someone as long as their activity is not directly harming my person or property. I can think that it is disgusting and horrible...but that doesn't mean that I can puch that view on someone else. I would just hope that they would see it as that. In my eyes...do whatever you want just don't impose it on me.  I took a few notes of this debate...it really was sad to see that the people in that place were actually applauding the retards on the right. I call them that because they are indeed morally and socially retarded. It would seem that they would love to live under a system that really doesn't give them even the choice of what they want for dinner...because to argue against the seperation of church and state (which they all were arguing that they should be combined!!!!) is really to argue for a system that has been proven time and time again to fail. So to argue this point...or from this side is indeed retarded. Like sticking your hand back into the fire five minutes after you stuck it in before and got burned.  David Limbaugh...who the fuck is he? I dunno...but I will say this. He is about as smart as horseshit in your refrigerator. He actually argued that the congress should limit the Supreme Court under Article 3 of the constitution. I looked and I sure couldn't find any limiting factors there. Actually it affirms that the court is pretty much above the fray of political shit that floats in our bowl of democracy.  He argues that (what in reality has been a mostly conservative president appointed panel) the court is very liberal. They are out of hand and need to be replaced.  I dunno...but I think this guy needs to have some sense beaten into him.  Jay Sekulow. He is a piece of work I tell ya. Imagine what a failed televangilist looks like. The hair, plastic skin look, tanned, with a bad almost pimp suit on. Umm yeah. That is this dude. He stated that President Bush is "the comander and chief of the constitution". What? I literally shook my head at that. I really don't know what that means. It was probably one of the dumbest things I have heard...almost like "if it hadn't have been for my horse I wouldn't have made it through college that year." A famous Louis Black joke...about anuerisms and how they are caused...  This guy is a walking anuerism. I can't think of one thing intelligent coming out of this dude. Really he just didn't make sense. He would say something one way and then turn it around and completely disprove his prior statement only a few minutes later.   Ann Coulter is the argument for abortion...ow my chest got a little pain on that one...I guess I do have some sort of soul...and I ripped a little of it out for that one.   I have seen her on CNN, Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, now C-Span...she is a living, breathing, barely intelligible, cave woman. What she argues for...the positions that she takes would literally take women back to being nothing more that walking wombs...they would have no rights...hell under her ideals she wouldn't even exist. I can not honestly understand how she can be such a walking talking conflict...  Not only does she flat out lie...Read Al Frankens book and he actually has the good ones on her...but she is also not that intelligent. Now...I know I call a lot of people stupid...not always because I think they are genuinely stupid...but becasue they act that way. I think she is the real deal. I am sure that my intelligence would be sucked out if I were ever to be in the near presence of this woman. She really needs to get back to what she must do well and that is suck...there is no way that she could get published unless she was blowing people...really she has no platform...she has no intelligible ideas...I mean the woman is just useless. The only thing that the Republicans need her for is a pretty face (and hell she looks like skeletor...even more so than Maria Shriver....Ahhhnolds wife). She is the Atypical Republican woman...or at least what they would love to have all over the place. Someone who really isn't informed or intelligent and will seed to the man whenever the man needs to take "charge"...she is a Barbie...nice and pretty to play with...but you put Barbie away whenever you need to actually take care of business.  I hope she reads this...or this gets on to her. I think you are quite possibly the most useless person on the face of this earth...hell at least even our current president is good at something...he is good at making war on everything and everyone. You on the other hand probably are good at consuming air. I don't know. I would spit on your shoes. After that I would simply ignore you...because for me to give you anymore acknowledgment of a person would be a waste of time and energy. I don't have time for stupid people.   Alan Dershowitz...he is an interesting bird...I don't actually agree with his positions on Israel...but hey we can dissagree on some things yet be united on others...  He put it very well and this argument can hold up to any litmus test of history. Try and prove it wrong.   Religion thrives only when the government keeps its hands out of it. Religion is endangered only in places where a state sponsored religion is promoted.   The final most damning one...the one that really is good.   If you need to ask the government for help in your religion (monetary or promotional) then you don't have faith in your own religion.  It states that if your religion is so whacko and out there then probably you are wrong (well at least according to market economics...which ironically is what most Republicans ascribe too...their religion is to whacky so people don't go and give to the church...hahaha...ironic)  Again I don't always agree with him. But when he is right...he is really right.  Barry Lynn is a preacher. He sees the need for church and state to be seperate. Again because once you get government involved in religion in any way...then you will be promoting a state religion. He goes as far as I do and says that "under god" should be struck from the pledge..."in god we trust" from our money...the only place where he does not promote the stripping of references to "god" is from the supreme court...and not because he thinks it should be there...but because the court has already ruled on it...saying basically that in the introduction for the justices and the ceremony that goes along with it are basically untouchable.   I agree...it was and has always been a part of the ceremony...blah blah blah...god save the country, blah blah blah...it really is a holdover from the British "god save the queen"....  I have the strong belief that he holds a similar view as I do on abortion. You cannot be as seemingly enlightened as he is without having come to a similar conclusion on abortion that I have. I feel I am somewhat enlightened on things...that is why I have that view.  Being a preacher gives him street cred...and he calls for Christians to defend the constitution because if they/we don't then sooner or later our religion will be banned...it just happens that way. History shows us that...our nation was born out of that.  Nadine Strossen is the President of The ACLU...while I am not always in agreement with them...they really aren't politically scewed...they only want to fight for the constitution...which makes for some strange bedfellows.   She brought up a few myths...one was that Christians here are oppresed...she makes the point that in reality you could never be elected as president without being a christian...just wouldn't happen and may never happen.   The other is that in reality some of the most devout christians...the really good godly ones...are actually for the seperation of church and state. The believe that religion is private and should have no mettling in it from the government...  Hell the ACLU has even argued a case for Jerry Fallwell...and are currently on a case in VA for a city councelman that was giving out fliers in his campaign that essentially argued for the merging of Church and State...something about the election laws there prevent that...but the ACLU has stepped in on his behalf because they view his right to free speech and free religion are paramount over what bad he might be saying.  Overall the Liberals...or the liberal side of the panel really made its case. Not just because I am liberal or want them to win. They made it because they fired everything back at the other side...and to an open minded person made them look like alarmists.  The conservatives were just plain pitiful. They play the fear card all the time. They attempt to frame this entire issue as a moral issue.   I am tired of the right wingers out there arguing for church and state to be together and faith based initiatives...when you get into that you know that your government is no longer working for the people...all of them. Instead it has become a quasi-taliban like government that places religious ideals over all else...  Now would that be bad if the people who were in power were actually following what the "good" book says? I dunno...but I know that if they actually lived up to the ideals described in the Bible...we would really see something quite different from what we see today.  These aren't hard concepts at all people. Really they aren't.

      I get off the Anti-Biotics tomorrow...only because I have been on them for five weeks now...and frankly we are crossing into kidney/liver damage territory if I keep on them any longer.  It will be good to be off them for a bit...cause my body is just completely wrecked. I am so tired and completely wrecked emotionally and physically.  I am going to enjoy my body righting itself...well I won't but at least I can try and get back to normal for a bit.  I go in this next week and hopefully things will be well...but I doubt it because I really do feel like shit most of the time.  Today I had work...I worked about 8 hours...and I feel totally wiped out. It feels like someone has been beating on me with a bat...all over.  I have this nasty rash on my back...it is itchy and has been putting out pustules and crap for the past two weeks. They look like blackheads of zits...but they aren't...it is a reaction to the high levels of drugs in my body...most of the itchy bumps dont have anything in them...but are red and irritated...it is certainly weird...the nurse caught it today and she thinks it is an alergic reaction to something (probably the IV Azactam...as it is a derrivative of a pennicylin)...so we will see if it clears a little after a while.  I dunno folks...I am just worn out.  Well I am going to get a few more things done and then head to bed...  Oh yeah HAPPY THANKSGIVING...remember to be thankful for even the most inate things. I sure am...for me I am thankful for those few days that I wake up and actually feel half way decent.

      Well I have found out so far that the generic benadryl is better than the name brand...strange huh...I guess it has less fillers in it that my body would need to process.  So I am gald I got them instead of splurging on full Benadryl....the brand name add some strange stuff that is different from generic.  So I will stick with that...oh yeah I am getting the video recoded for Unaswered Questions and there is a new DVD that I wanna get a hold of because it promises to be a good watch.  Man I am so disapointed in what we have become. I love America...I think that we have the potential to be what we once were...thought well of and somewhat respected across the globe...as it stands now we arent...and we need that back.

      Well today I did finally get some sleep...well yesterday.  It wasn't good sleep. I hate that.  Tonight I am going to say it loud and clear and fully support Howard Dean. I have been a supporter of his for a little bit now, however after watching the DeanTV and some of the talks and "propoganda" (I call it that because propoganda really is information...and not always a bed thing)...  The First one that I tackled watching was a 23 minute Speech in front of the AAPI Town Hall Meeting. He nailed everything. Really he did. He hit on all the weak spots and then went on to tackle the morals of those spots. He speech is rough, his message is clear to those who are even moderately informed...and his remarks on Race Issues were absolutely spot on (no doubt because of his earlier speeches that were right...but wrongly worded). He is tackling all these things head on.   At the end he finally said what I needed to hear for me...really it was the words that he said that I have been wanting any candidate to come out and say. Basically he said "I can't do it for you...politicians promise many things and in reality deliver nothing...I can only effect a little change on my own...but with all of us we can make the changes."  For too long all politicians have said was "vote for me and I will make things better"...and all to often people have fallen for it (most likely because we have placed false belief in them with the hopes that maybe, just maybe they will pay lip service to the causes that they preach.  He sad he can't do that. That takes balls..big brass balls.   He hasn't hid his past in shame. He was a teacher for some time...he is a MD and could choose to go back to that (and probably make obscene amounts of money because if he brings his ethics of campaigning into a Practice then he would most certainly make a great living).   He is calling for us to return to the high moral purpose so that we can once again have the hope that we are the best...and that we can be fair to the rest of our world citizens.  If you haven't seen the clips or films...go and watch...you will be converted.  He is a scappy northeasterner most well known for their aggresive attitudes and straight forward speak...  It is time to take it to the streets and change things.  It is time to fight fire with fire...fire back at them on the morality issues. The Republicans weakness as of late has been Moral Virtues and Iraq as well as the economy.  He is gruff and many times doesn't get the "politically correct" answers...  Just go watch...because it really is the right words and the right message...  He has it...he has the best balances. We need Dr. Howard Dean.  Go get involved...you will not regret it.   Do it now! Please

      Oh god damnit...mother fucking son of a bitch ass shit stab motherfucker....damnit!!!!  I had a large post that I had already written when I get a message to go here...and lo and behold I lost my post....shit!!!!  Ok...lets try this again...only this time it is worse. Ok..ok...here we go.  I feel like shit. My heart hurts really badly. It hurts on the left side of my chest right on top of where my heart is at. It feels like a stabbing pain each time I breath in and out. It hurts like a motherfucker.  In between each and every breath my lower back hurts like someone is hitting me there with a fucking baseball bat.   So between breathing, heart pain, back pain, and a really big fucking headache I am not a very happy camper.  Oh yeah and I have gone into another bout with Insomnia...for the past few nights I haven't slept hardly at all...plus the medication isn't working to make me sleep. When I do get to sleep I wake up from something going into a spasm...usually a lung.  All this shit is happening right when I should be doing much better. The doctors don't know, the X-Rays don't show anything, the bloodwork shows I am a little out of whack, and obviously the CAT Scan I had wasn't to off otherwise someone would have called me.  On top of it Jesse is here and we need to be concentrating on this project we have going. I have a stack of paper over here that I have to scan in and run through OCR so that I won't have to retype everything.  I will finally get to see the plan as I get it re-entered into the computer and hopefully get a sense of what is going on. I am really excited about it...but obviously I can't show it which I am afraid is making Jesse nervous. I really wanna do this and I am hoping that I physically can hold out and get things together.  So today will be spent doing a lot of office type work.  I also got to look at the problem on his system...he wasn't able to log on using the Ethernet port in the system...but it worked fine when I plugged it in here...no problems. However between his house in Hershey and here Evercrack died on him. It just won't start. I dunno what is going on with that...I haven't ever played Evercrack nor do I want to...I think it just needs to be re-installed and things should be fine.  I am hoping that I can get over all this soon because I need to be healthy for more than a few days at a time. I hate this part of it...but honestly I cannot complain to much because in the grand scheme of things I am not all that bad off. Really I am just frustrated that I have gone from where I was to here in such a short time. I want it to stop...I want to feel better. I don't want to be this way.  I am also very lonely. There are people around me. I have made a great new friend in Danielle and I really enjoy talking to her. I have a great family all things considered. Yet I am still alone. Maybe Danielle has felt the same way.  The suffering that goes on is very personal. It is something that even though I know others are, and have gone through it; I still feel alone.  I have tried turning to religion and never once has it made that go away. I tried other things (wink wink) and it didn't help...in the end it only hurt and now makes me long for those things (because I may have been alone, my body may have been failing, but it didn't matter cause mentally I felt well). I don't know how to help the feeling out. I don't know that there is anything that can remedy it. I feel only a close connection to something for short pieces of time...like that first millisecond that I pet my dog or give him a hug...or the short thrill when I see a porn clip, or the laughter that I get out of Aqua Teen Hunger Force...but it is all fleeting and the happiness that comes with those things doesn't last long...it lasts but mere moments and then is gone.  I don't think there is anything for that. I don't think there is a cure for that...and really I don't know that even if I was healthy that it would be any different. I would like to think so...but I don't think that for sure.  Well this post is getting long...and sitting here has really put a strain on my back...and the pain in my chest is getting worse. There is something wrong and I don't know how to fix it...so in all likelyhood I will remain in bad pain.   Not to mention that the Medicare "reform" bill will probably pass and become law...so that means I will not have insurance again soon. Just wait...people watch what happens. So many people will be hurt by this...many seniors and many more sick people will go untreated. The system will fail. People will die...and the rich will get richer.  If I could make it all right by killing people...if I could be all powerful for even a week...all I would need is a week...things would just be done.  One of the first things I would do is just open peoples eyes...and guess what. I bet I wouldn't need to do much more. Because if people were to actually see and experience the wrongs...then they would in all likelyhood make things right. I would also bannish all of the rich and selfish people to a small island that they could not escape...let them try and survive without all the things that they have now. It would be required that they live in the dirtiest conditions that they have wrought upon us...live without micron filters in the Lexus Autos to help filter out the polution that they have pumped into our atmosphere.   The rich selfish people would simply be banned. What would be required of all people is compassion and understanding. If they were to walk a mile in our shoes they would see how unfair it all really is.   I am just so angry....so sick...and I really wish that things would just be right.  In a perfect world there would be an all knowing and all powerfull god...but we don't live in that illusion or fantasy...at least not the people that are suffering at the hands of others.  Just fight people...fight while you can. If you don't fight pretty soon you won't be able to live. By Live I mean literally...the people that have our country in a strangle hold aren't in some far flung corner of the world...they are in power here...they are the real evil. The only difference between them and Bin Laden and Hussein is that they were obviously evil...these guys wrap themselves in a "cloak of christ" and pass themselves off as good people...when clearly if you strip away the god robe you would see that they are the same evil people...and I do mean evil. Evil in the real sense of the world...if there is a hell...they probably hail from it.  Only the ungodly need to prove to each other that they are godly. A godly person doesn't need prove it to people...they just know.  So the next time you see someone on TV talking about god, or espousing their godly purpose...remember only those that need to prove, brag.

      Well today was pretty much boring...it was semi busy which made the day go by pretty fast.  I am so tired out...it was just a long tedious day. I am glad that I don't have to work tomorrow because if I had I would certainly harm inocent bystanders...  Now much to report...outside of the fact that I am tired.  I have tried out the new keyboard and mouse in gaming...and it works well. It will take a bit of time to get things down again...but I know I can do it :-)  Goodnight all...tomorrow Jesse is coming out from Hershey and we have lots of stuff to go over...yipee! We have a lot of work to do :-)...at least it is work.  The closer we get to having things together the better it looks and the more excited I get about it all...yes!  Alright...now bedtime for me.

      Oh yeah and I have found the IndyMedia in the burg...I may be joining to help out...lord only knows they need more people to get the word out...  Also the ACLU is looking for people as well...I might also zip something off to them...  What will be nice is that these jobs are mainly done behind desks and paper pushing for a good cause...leaving a mojority of my time to devote to other things.   PGH Indy Media Center

      Well...today I met a hottie. Her name is Jen. I'm sure she likes to bang...she is maybe a hair taller than I am...she has nice tits and ass...I wanna bang her. Is there anything wrong with that.  I think I should change the name of this blog to "psychotics am i" because I am so schizo about my topics...no coherance...no direction...just plain out ramblin from my head...  yup  today was one of those days that if my brain could have come oozing out of my nose...it probably would have.  Balu...the Indian that runs one of the stands in our little group has been having problems with the people that run the stand next to his. Basically when you have a kiosk you are only allowed to accost people that are within two feet of your stand...so you don't step on retailers feet, or other kiosks...  Well the Israeli's have consistantly day in and day out ignored that...I have seen them running after people to stop them and have them come look at their products....nothing wrong with that in my mind...I wouldn't do it but hey more power to ya if you do...but the problem is really poaching...  People will stop in front of Balu's stand and look and decide...hell its bamboo...tranquil...it can take a few minutes to sink in. The Israeli's don't give Balu anytime to react and are all over people in front of his cart...looking at his stuff...well lets say they are like flies on shit.  Balu has repeatedly asked them nicely to leave people alone when they are obviously in front of his cart and looking...and repeatedly they have ignored it...well the Jews that work there are great and they are only doing the bidding of their boss...plus they work on straight commission...almost indentured servitude...only on Jews. (strange how history repeats itself...)  Well Balu finally got fed up and got a hold of the guy who actually runs that cart...and before you could say Jihad he was down there yelling at Balu.  Balu...picture your average 28-35 Indian male from a lower caste...hard worker, intelligent, and really nice guy. He wouldn't say shit if he had a mouthfull...he probably thank Sheva or something...  Back to it...this little Jew was up in his face screeming bloody murder (I'm sure he called Balu an anti-semite) about this and that and how Balu's stuff was crap...blaa blaa blaa blaa blaa...now Balu never once raised his voice...he is a good Hindu (I think he is Hindu) and maintained his calm.  Well the thing just kept going and going...I was starting to get a little pissed for Balu...because obviously how do you stop an attack when you are a passivist in nature...you can't. I am not really a passivist...I am more of passive aggressive...I let things slide to a point...then I attack.  Well after the verbal tiff was over Balu turned around and I have never seen such controlled rage in a man before. I could tell that he wanted to beat the little Jew to death...but he maintained his cool.  Once the Jews were slightly out of earshot I looked at him and said bluntly..."That is why they are hated the world over"...and they are. It isn't because of religion or whatever differences Jewish people bring up about faith and this and that...the simple fact is that I have yet to meet a Jewish person that is polite.  Polite.  Polite...the key word. Yes you are trying to run a business...but when you shit on your employees (who are Jewish as well) and you shit on the community around you...and you shit on people outside your faith as the Jewish people tend to do...at some point people say enough is enough...it isn't about hating the Jew...it is about hating the attitude.   I am glad that I kept my mouth out of it...and I am glad that I haven't been asked my opinion...because this is what I would say. Harsh coming...  "You don't want my opinion...because the last time my people had an idea we killed over 8 million of you." Yes I said it.   Look I really did say it...its right there.  Now this comes from humor first and foremost...but it also comes from a total space of frustration with a people that has been whining and bitching throughout their history no matter how good or bad it was...they have always whined and put others down and treated others with less respect than a dog.  I am not saying that I hate Jews...I am saying that I hate when they live up to the stereotype...the Israeli's that I work with are certainly nice people...but several of them have the whining gene that must be ingrained into them all...they are really nice...but they still whine and moan...and bitch.  Am I wrong? I would love to be wrong. Really I would. I feel that I am not.   The world doesn't have it out for the Jewish people...the world has it out for their attitude and culture. They do not treat anyone with the slightest bit of respect and constantly dehride people that aren't of the Jewish faith...and then they internalize it and put each other down...  Basically they are an unhappy people. They all need to take massive amounts of Prozac and just let it go...if the Jewish people as a whole continue down the path (a path they have travelled before I might add) that they are on...we will see another holocost...and this time it may be a complete whiping out of their people.  History repeats itself...always. The only way to keep that from happening is to learn from history and change the course before it is to late.  So to you Jews out there...start praticing what you preach...and spread it out...because if you don't you could very well find yourselves in the Warsaw Ghetto...or a death camp...and this time around most of the world will remember the havoc you have wrought across the globe.  Now back to that Jen girl....she made me all tingly...very tingly indeed...I could have fun with that. I hope I get to see her again ;-) Nekkid!  Goodnight...I have work in the morning :-)

      All day today my mind was consumed with thoughts of my impending decision. I keep waffling back and forth.   Of coarse I want to live longer, everybody does, but I don't want to continue living under the gun or on a time table...I have already done that for all my life and frankly it is old now.  Again I haven't made any real decisions...of coarse when I do I will post them.  Tomorrow I should hopefully be back to spunky old self with a lot of anger over something political.  The only thing that I will mention today will actually be nice about the administration and a hope that they will do something.  It is about NASA...it really is a national asset and Americans have just kind of taken it for granted. There is currently word circling round Washington that a call for returning to the Moon and setting up a base is in order and that the Administration will look at the options once a plan is submitted to them.  I know politcally and strategically why they want to do it...because the Chinese have committed to a ten year plan to get to the moon and set up a base...we are mulling it over because that can't happen of course.  Well I would hope that the president would call for us to go back and set up shop...it is about damn time. However I would suggest that he do something slightly different.  I make the call that we combine our resources with Russia, China, Japan, and the EU and make Mars the target and no later than 2015.  We can do it...together we can get there. The technology gained from that trip or rather preparing for it would be a boon for the world.  Peace

      Before I went to bed last night I was finally able to find the PanjabI MC CD "Beware" and was able to get it downloaded last night. It is so hard to find anything other than the same old drull in music stores nowadays. I mean seriously I go to a music store and I see rows and rows of pure shit but to actually come across something halfway decent or even original.  I guess I heard the MC Panjabi track "Mundian to Back Ka" back a few months ago and I thought damn that is cool. I downloaded it in one of my late night fits looking for something new. I listened to it and was enchanted because of the Knight Rider theme and interesting lyrics (which I don't understand as it is one of the Indian Languages...I think Hindi..I have a True Indian friend and I will ask him what dialect it is). Then I saw the video...wow beautiful women. The people in the video were different and colourful. Again not the same old drull that is forced upon us here in the states. We live in a homogonized world where everything is edited and pasturized for our listening pleasure. We never see any colour outside of black and white...which is sad.  Well after a long quest for the full CD I finally found it and pirated it. Yes I pirated it...but try finding it in a local store! It is imposible even though he won coveted awards for the CD and best dance track in Europe! On MTV no less!!!!! The CD is absolutely amazing! While I don't understand the lyrics because I don't speak the language the music translates into any language. The beats are just there. He is able to blend together the best of western style beats (dance mostly, house flavoured) and Eastern sounds like the sitar, some sort of flute (pan perhaps), and the beautiful vocals the accompany Indian music (things that I can't even imagine making my voice do).  As you listen to the CD you yearn to know what is being sung, and you yearn to see that part of the world.  While I never advocate piracy of any sort...you have gotta get this Album...it really is different and opens up different types and styles of music without being so far that western ears can't handle it. It gives you a taste without the bitter taste of Curry. Give this album a shot. You won't be dissapointed.  To give you a taste here is the video  Panjabi MC "Mundian to Bach Ke" Video

      Today was pretty long...the nurse came out early today to gather some blood. She had to draw from my port and stick me in an arm because this was a full workup...or rather a workup to see if my port is infected.  I have basically spent the day trying not to think about everything. I have been fairly successful at that...until I come upstairs to write in my blog.  Funny thing ain't it.  I have not made any decisions yet...but I do think I will go ahead with the evaluation and get that process started. So if I decide to go ahead with it then I will already be started...if I decide not too...then really nothing is lost but maybe a week.  Tariq Ali...a name that you all should become familiar with. He is one of the most intelligent voices out there that has critism for the US and its policies...but he holds no illusions. One quote that he gave tonight was pretty good "the though was consumerism and fornication...and I hope that is what we all are doing...but it isn't enough" Brilliant....saying that hey its ok to be that way but at the same time saying that a person really needs more than that to get by.  His voice is one that I have come to trust because I hear nothing behind it sinister. He speaks well and just seems to hang it all out there and lets people decide.  Go get a hold of some of his material and judge for yourselves.  Peace

      Well I went to the doctor today and it was an interesting visit to say the least.  They simply can't figure out why I am not responding to the drugs, they don't know what the rash is, they can't pinpoint why my lungs, heart, and back hurt...basically they are at a loss overall. I hate complaigning to them because it makes me sound like I am whining all the time...and sometimes I think I am crazy because they keep on coming up empty handed.  The jist of it is...if I continue to have fevers over the next few days, and things just don't get better I will be spending a lot of time in the hospital until they figure out what in the hell is wrong.  Also I got the news today that I need to actually think about transplant. It comes down to they know something indeed is going on in me and since they can't find it they are going under the assumption that it is tearing me up. My lung functions have no come back at all...I have remained pretty low overall...and now my oxygen saturation is finally dropping...that means my lungs have finally sustained to much damage and they are just going to continue breaking down.  I knew this was coming and in reality I have been thinking a lot about it. It is hard to have to think about it because I just don't know what to do.  Dr. Pelewski laid it out for me...he told me that we should go ahead and start the paperwork and evaluation process now considering that we haven't gotten the bugs. I will have to go in for a full batery of tests that will last a week or so depending. I am sure there will be psych evals and all.  He gave me some numbers to chew on. One is depending on my blood type I could wait up to three years before organs become available...it is all the luck of the draw. Also that while there are many people living past five years now the general rule is that 50% don't make it longer than 5 years after their transplants. Usually because of infection or rejection.  A lot to ponder.   What this means for me now is that I have to literally put my life on hold until I know what I am going to do. Really it means that I have to stop everything in its tracks...because it is only going to get harder from this point out and I will need all my energy just to fight this war.  I am releaved and saddened at the same time. I guess I am in the home stretch now...and I just have to do what is best for me...and try and make my dent on the world now...because I am almost out of time.  I hate all of this. I hate that I have to face it. I hate that anyone has to face it.   So I guess I am off to ponder...

      Today as you can see by my first post below started out pretty late. Below is about the time I got up today. When I got up I felt like hell...I mean I really felt like hell. I sat around for a bit feeling like shit and wondering why...finally I realized that I was a little warm. So I broke out the trusty thermometer...lo and behold I was running a temp of 103! I kept an eye on it throughout the day and it wavered a little...but right now it is at around 102F. I wondered why I felt bad and had a raging headache all day...could it have been because I was cooking a few braincells...hmmm.  I got a message back from Indymedia Center here in Pittsburgh. I guess I need to get together a little resume' of things I have done and what I can do.   It is really hard to type right now because my fingers actually hurt...they started bleeding...yes bleeding the other day and haven't really stopped. I think my pinky has an infection in it...it is swollen and feels like it has needles in it...the other pinky is also swollen...but I don't rely on it as much to type.  So tonight I will be brief...as you can see from the posts below things are coming together quite nicely for our side...the peoples side. Like I have said before we need to include the mainstream...woo them and bring them into the fold. They are the ones with money and influence...they are the ones...the only ones that can effect change on the scale that we want. We must not alienate them...we must court them and show them we mean no harm...that we mean to help and bring about a just and fair society that will benefit all people of the planet.

      Score one for the good guys! Diebold has backed off of its DMCA prosecution against people posting internal emails about flaws in its voting software!!!  Guess which plucky little presidential candidate jumped on the bandwagon to help in the fight. None other than Dennis Kucinich!  Go little D!   Cnet Writeup   I call for all the other Democratic Nominees to also come out against Diebold and help expose the looming problem that many in the computer world have known about. We have been saying for some time that this is a problem. Finally it is getting a little attention. Mainstream media has dropped the ball on this one, but the people have not.

      Ok...I let my anger somewhat slide over the past few days over Bush's visit to Iraq. Now that I have calmed down I have finally come to place where I think that I can talk a little about it.  How do I feel about it?   First I am glad that he did visit Iraq and the troops that he sent there to probably be shot up or killed. He should go. He should be faced with the decision that he and his politico's came too well before even 9/11. I wanted him to go...perhaps stick around for a bombing or something...but it was right that he go.  Do I agree that he should have gone?  No...actually I think it was foolish and obviously a political play. It will be plastered all over his upcoming campaign, it will be used as ammo...it will be used as a tool to "show" that he cares.  His visit to Iraq was in all fairness not really a visit to Iraq...it was a visit to a US military base...where the security could be assured and the possibility that he might actually face an angry public non-existant.  As many international news agencies have bluntly put...this was the opening for his campaign.   I only wish that he would have taken a helicopter ride around Bahgdad...to really get the feel of the situation. Well he is after all a pilot and supposedly is trained in how to survive...you know all that loyal service to the Texas Air National Guard. Or he could have taken a drive around the city in the unprotected HUMVEES that our troops trek round in. Of course this was not to be because after all he is the most powerful man in the world...  Thinking of it he is...yet he cannot go anywhere without facing the angry mod. What differentiats this mob from others is that it truly is a cross section of the people...these aren't hippies, these aren't revolutionaries, these aren't perhaps some of our seedier members of society...these are college students, homemakers, servicemen, veterans, politicians, people like you and I. The people that are against this are the people who are hurt by it the most...and that is everyone outside of the select few at the upper eschelons of power.   We are rapidly approaching critical mass here in the States. Our economy is so badly damaged that we have around 9 million unemployed (around 6 percent officially unemployed...not including those who have just stopped looking for work and not recieving benefits). We have upwards of 40 million people uninsured. No longer are the poorest amongst us without...it is now eating into the suburbanites lifestyle. People across the nation are reeling at what is going on. Quietly sucking their thumbs, rocking back and forth, hoping that next week things will be better. Some are hoping that the economy has a quick rebound, but most know that it won't happen. These are the educated amongst us that are starting to see things slip away. They see that even if they are employed that their take home pay...what they see each month is less and less.   Where will this lead us in the future? I haven't a clue...but I do know that if things don't improve people generally tend to get a little restless. Social norms change, people look to other solutions, people start to stray from the idea that capitalism is the best system.   Capitalism and Democracy don't mix. They never have because capitalism requires a willing public to go along with making a mere few very rich while delegating the rest to a life of survival from paycheck to paycheck. I know this because of my neighbors. I see them with a mortgage, car notes, monthly bills, and if they were to loose one paycheck the entire system would fall to its knees. I know this because while we have the richest people in the world living here we also have the highest level of bankruptcies in the world. I know this because when you can walk from one house in a suburban neighborhood where food is plenty to just three houses down there is a family that scraped together enough money to purchase a turkey for Thanksgiving.   In Ohio 2 million of the 11 million citizens have to go to food pantries so they can eat. In Ohio! Where 1 in 6 lost their jobs over the last three years (mostly manufacturing jobs which pay well). In some places college tuition is up 25% over the past couple of years...what does this all mean?  It means simply that the capitalist idea does not work well...and especially here it doesn't work well. We see it in policy. We see it in the new rules where Corporations no longer have to tell the community when a chemical that could harm the community has been spilled...not because of National Security (I don't think PPG here in Springdale makes much outside of house paint...or dyes). We see it in the policies of our nation to curb free speech...not by banning it but by making it not profitable to the person making the speech. Where we can essentially curb free speech through threats of forclosure or causing a person to loose their job.  Now that Mr. and Mrs John Doe on Cherry Hill Dr. see that all they have planned, saved, and worked hard for can go because some Corporation decides that it would be a few pennies cheaper to outsource Mr. Doe's job to a foreign nation...not just because it is cheaper but because then the company doesn't have to have environmental plans.  as Mr. Doe sees this...sees all the problems that he faces he will start to look outward...not inward because he knows that he has done everything "right" to be a success...he went to school, got married, had 2.3 kids and a dog, bought a house, a new car, and the big screen TV...he did all the right things but he can't put food on his table for his children...and not to mention that he can't even imagine being able to afford sending little Billy and Sue to college...even though he started a fund for that.  When Mr. Doe sees this and realizes why...that is when things will change. Because there isn't just a few Mr. Does' out there. There are millions of them...from every background, every ethnicity. Once they all come together something will have to happen. Not because someone planted it in his ear...but because he knows it is right...he will take action and things will change.  Often people refer to all these problems as numbers. That is all people see...numbers. They are easy to swallow, easy to digest, easy to forget. Putting a human face on these numbers is the priority...or rather should be the priority of us who want to effect change.  That will be our weapon. We may need guns to forcibly change things...we may need other things. However the most important thing that we could ever have...weapon wise is 40 million Mr. and Mrs. John Does'. We musn't forget them, we need to include them. We need to bring them into the fold.  We can't scare them with and overload them with all this information that is indeed needed for them to survive...but instead we need to introduce them to new thoughts. We need to show them that we really don't mean them any harm. Right now we are the left wing conspiracy nuts. They can't identify with us because we want so many different things...our voice has become muffled by a frayed front. When we unify, when we pacify, when we pull it all together and slap a happy face on ourselves and become very serious and business like in how we deal with things...then we will have those 40 million strong middle americans who want for nothing more than to live comfortably without having to worry about health care or where their next meal is. These people are mainsteam for a reason. Not because they don't believe what we say...but they can't identify with what we say. However they are coming. They are our great saviour.   So reach out to the conservatives...you may find in the end that you hold many things in common. We must not comprimise, but we must not intimidate them in following our lead. Show them that what we want is the best for all and identify with them on a personal level...and they will gladly follow. That is how the right won their stunning victories. They scared the people over to there side by speaking half truths and outrite lies. We cannot do that because they are already disallusioned. Face them with facts and numbers...then show them that they are what we are fighting for...not just for our crazy ideas but for their welfare.  Once we do that we will win everytime...regardless of who is in power. So continue to be as left or right as you want...it doesn't matter...however instead of threatening the other side to move with us we must invite them.  Once we offer a better deal they will take it. They will take it because it is best for themselves and family and they are smart enough to realize that.  It is simple in concept hard in practice because knowing how strongly I feel about it...I am sure there are others out there that are a lot better at this than I am. We can do it if we pull together and speak as one...then once we have made it the topic then we can get through better law, better ideals, and in the end a better healthier planet.

      I just noticed on my page there is a little banner add. I have known that there was one there...mainly because this is a free site that allows me to blog...I sometimes knew that it was advertising for Google or other places...  Today I noticed when I brought up my page that it had ads for David Limbaughs book "Persecution"...I am almost mad because I would never ever promote a book like his...that right wing nazi. He is one of the bad people in the world and should die.  In smaller print you see Jim Hightowers link...in really really small print...and it is just a link...not really a tag line or anything.  Also a link for political discussion in an open forum...I really haven't followed the link so I wouldn't know about it.  I wonder if my blog has garnered the attention of anyone yet. I know the Government has little web crawlers plodding through the internet all the time to kinda keep an index of things...I wonder if it has made it to my corner of the web yet...It will it is only a matter of time...

      Wow do I feel like shit. I mean I really feel like shit. I didn't sleep well last night yet I still had to get up early to come to work. If Denise didn't have to depend on me today I would have called in sick...because I am seriously feeling like shit.  Did I mention that I feel like shit? Yeah shit...the stuff that you poop out each day...  The rash is worse today...there seems to be no end to the hell that I go through on a daily basis. I have pretty much given up hope that I could have a normal day at this point.   I really wish they could pin this infection down and get rid of it quickly because all the meds are doing more damage than the infection itself.   I hate bitching and moaning about things I really do...but right now that is about all the energy I can muster...because bitching is soooo easy.  I get to visit the doctor on Wenesday so maybe he will have a new plan of attack...who knows? I don't.  What I think I need is a solid week of sleep....like no waking up to eat or pee...just sleep. My bateries are run down and my nerves are frayed.  Well I am off to look for some political stuff...cause you know that gets me fired up...maybe it will wake me up a bit so that I am not sitting here almost falling asleep.  Baaahhh  Oh yeah and did I tell you that I feel like shit!!!

      Today was just a long day...that is all I can really say positive about it.  I am still sick...stuff in my lungs is getting thicker and nastier in colour. My body is a mess and their ain't much more they can do. I see the doc on Wednesday so we will see if he has anything...anything up his sleeve.   I am breaking out in a rash...I dunno what it is from. My back looks like I have really bad achne and it is spreading to my face...but it isn't achne or zits...it is just a rash...with little blisters popping up. It all is painful and kinda gross...so when I see the doc on Wednesday I will ask for something...maybe a referral to a Dermatologist to see if there is anything that can be done...my skin just feels like it is breaking down. I hope they can figure that out because it is not something I really need right now for another part to go bad.  So here is the summary. I still have a lung infection, my kidneys and liver hurt, my gut is constantly upset, I am constantly on the verge of being out of breath, my fingers (cuticles) are peeling back, migraines, CFRD (CF Related Diabetes) is working a number on me, and I am tired...  Outside of that...well my world is peachy.  I ask for no sympathy or pity, all I ask is that if you pray or meditate, please devote a little time thinking nicely of me.   This week promises to be hectic...I am sure because I have a lot to get done...and just seems that I don't have all the energy to get it all done with...  Love out to the world. Mike

      Today really was a wasted day. I slept until 4:30PM...then I really just zoned out...now I am getting ready for bed.  Tomorrow will be busy I am sure. I hope it will be busy because I really don't want to just sit around and do nothing.  Oh well...maybe something tomorrow will be interesting.  Oh...I saw Bill Moyers speech from Madison WI...it was a forum on media reform. His speech was dead on. He is the host of PBS's Now! With Bill Moyer. He is one of the few out there on a national level that has called to task all of what Bush and others have done in government to kill free speach and ultimately Democracy.  It wasn't all Bush bashing...he mentions democrats in with it as well...but more along the lines of the democrats have failed yet again to stand up to Bush's policy...  One line...a quote of his really got me and drove home the point "virtue is not inherited, even if your father was the president".  That drives it home. Bush Sr...while not the greatest President we ever had...definitely no friend to the liberal or people wanting to save the earth was at least someone you could look at and know that maybe he wasn't outright lying to you. Also he actually served his country...no so with Dubya...  I am still a Registered Republican...I still believe in many Republican platforms...but I have found myself at odds with that because of the overwhelming things I don't agree with them on. I would say I am a liberal republican...the only Republican that I can even remotely identify with is Sen. John McCain of Arizona...and I feel that the people Arizona should be proud of him. He is the last of the middle or liberal Republicans left. He is still what I would call the moral fiber holding the Republicans together.   I hope for his sake that he moves to become an independant...I am sure it will be much harder for him to be elected...but if the People of Arizona were to look he really has been very good for the State...and the Nation. Only fools would vote in a replacement at this point.   I find that I most identify with Kucinich on many many issues...but I approach it from a slightly different angle...like bringing back "public" utilities...I don't come from the aspect that it would be good...which it would...but I come from a cost perspective. Energy companies and producers get the largest tax breaks.   TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) was a public utillitie that sold electricity to people of the South...The TVA is credited with electrifying the south. Their kilowatt/hour charges were a little on the high side...but not really beaten out to badly with other provite power companies...  When TVA went private to be sure the rates dropped...probably by half....however no one seems to have taken into account for the massive tax breaks and incentives that were given to TVA by the Federal and State Governments...  Break it down like this.   TVA Public = 13 cents/kilowatt hour close to the cost to produce each watt TVA Private = 6 cents/kilowatt hour actual loss on each kilowatt sold...but with tax breaks and incentives then they break even and make money.  TVA Private actual cost = 6 cents from consumer + 8 or 9 cents from government tax breaks (which the people pay for by paying taxes) = 15 or 16 cents/kilowatt hour  It costs more to the consumer for power now...however it now costs less for big businesses to run using that electricity...because they are probably paying 4 or 5 cents/kilowatt hour...because they buy in bulk...the electricity actually still costs 12 cents to produce...who picks up the difference...not the businesses...but the taxpayers ultimately subsidize tons of industries just through direct subsities and tax breaks to Power companies....  not to mention corporate taxes have gone down steadily...so you see only the end consumer gets screwed on the deal. We are subsidizing people who are making money hand over fist...  Now the numbers I have given are only relative examples...they don't actually jive with current rates...but the concept is there....and that is why I chose to use numbers...numbers people can understand...not just words.  If you were to take away the tax breaks and incentives then you would quickly find out that all Electricity Providers in the nation would fail if they didn't raise their rates...because as it stands now the actual selling of the energy is not enough to cover the costs of producing it...  Why move them back public? Well under public systems the prices may be higher...but in the end are lower because Public means only that they have to provide power...and if something is going wrong at a plant they can pull it offline without fear of loosing profit...they just do it to make sure nothing happens...plus it is just plain cheaper to do things...  I hate the fact that no one has really looked into it to get all the numbers right. That may be something I do and zip off to the networks...because if people knew that they would cry for public systems to be re-established...oh yeah and the power shortages in California would have never happened because plants would be constantly updated instead of trying to run them to death and not fix anything...  I hope we can all come to the conclusion at some point that privatization is not always a good choice...privatization really only works on small scale things...not on large scale social needs or programs...never has, never will.

      Yesterday our ruler GW Bush declared that those surrender monkey nations would get none of the booty from Iraq saying that they could not participate in primary bids for contracts in Iraq. So I guess that means that Halliburton, Carlisle Group, and Bectel will get all the good no bid contracts (to be fair Carlisle Group is more of an investment group).  What wasn't said is that companies from those countries would be allowed to get secondary sub-contracts that spring forth from primary contracts...a good example is Seimens and Erricson are the actual companies supplying hardware for the new cellular network. So Bush misleads yet again.  Now what is so funny about this all is that he also appointed James Baker as a special envoy to go to these very countries to ask them to forgive the debts against Iraq....again that is a little misleading because in international courts...or rather law. When the US invaded and took over we actually took on all responsibilities of the government there from providing water to paying off debts...so in reality when we invaded we took on the 120-130 billion worth of debt that Saddam had racked up...and legally we are obligated to pay it.  Wooohooo! Now our national debt is really going to sore!  Now actually I agree with the president on this one...really by all rights it is the US taxpayers footing the bill right or wrong...so the money should stick to our companies...or be given to the Iraqi's (preferably) and let them contract out the work. However I don't that the latest "fuck you world" statement out of the White House is going to help us one bit in the longrun.  Whoever wins the White House is going to have to be making a lot of phone calls appologizing for our rogue government and what it is doing now.  Another great thing has happened. A week ago the EPA and White House were calling for a market based solution to Mercury Emissions that would allow plants to buy and sell pollution credits for Mercury. It is estimated that it would reduce the mercury emissions by about 70 percent over the next fifteen years. The prior mandate was that they clean up their acts and the mercury emissions would be dropped by 90 percent in the next four years. At that time they were arguing that mercury poisoning was a little overblown and such.  This week the EPA issued a warning for children and pregnant women to have them eat less tuna because of elevated mercury levels in the tuna...that could lead to mercury poisoning in people, especially those two groups.  Does anyone else see the irony here?  I think the country has gone mad...from all the mercury in the food...that could be the only explanation!  Peace..don't believe the lies.

      Not much to say today as I am tired from work...there was this christian lady that stopped today to talk to Denise...but before she got to talk to Denise this woman was trying to convert Hamza (I think that is her name) the Indian lady...I am pretty sure they are Hindu's  The woman left her with a flyer...and there was a word that Hamza didn't recognize...Satan. So I told Hamza what it meant. She then asked me about the christians and we talked for a few minutes and I gave her a quick lesson in christianity. Hamza said the greatest thing back to me "what is the big deal we all worship the same god you just call him by a different name".  Right on...even a Hindu gets it! But christians, muslims, and jews just don't...and really those religions are cousins of each other.  As I have come to my conclusion about it all and I told Hamza that you don't have to live a godly life...just a moral life and you will A-OK.  So stop the hate, forgive each other.  Peace

      Cloud10/Highradiation is holding a raffle for a Sony TRV900 3CCD.  If you would like a shot at is the tickets are 20 bucks each..not a bad deal to get in on a swanky camera. It is used as he was using it for his business and needs to upgrade his camera setup...and the new setup will run about 4 grand.  I personally is am going to enter twice...maybe more because it would be sweet to get a camera like that. So far the pool is somewhat low for the raffle so the odds are good.  If anyone is interested here is the   Link!   Go get you a ticket peeps.  Mike

      Well I watched the new Battlestar Galactica mini-series on Monday and Tuesday and I must say that I was thouroghly impressed and overjoyed at the treatment SciFi gave it.  The classic BSG was only 24 episodes for a total of 24 hours of program. The original became somewhat of a cult classic mostly because of the characters and technology they used which was good for the day. The largest complaint that I had with the original was it left a lot of things unexplained leaving gaping holes in the story line.  The new BSG mini-series tackled most of those holes in a new way. It explained the Cylons and went on to explain that the Cylons and Humans got into a bloody war and then there was an armistace. They built a far flung station for the Cylons and Humans to meet yearly to keep the peace. For 40 years the humans sent someone and for 40 years the Cylons sent no one.  That is how the series starts out with an ambassador from the humans at the station and he is startled when the opposing door opens and in march two Cylon centurions followed by a blond woman...who is a Cylon. The space station is destroyed and the war is on.  The series ends with a major showdown in which the Galactica protects the fleet as they jump with their Faster Than Light drives out of the hotzone and th Galactica following suit before they themselves are destroyed. It left open the door for a weekly series which I would bet good money that they will do...after all the put Tremors on...  For hardcore fans they may be mad at the results as it really changed the story and really only kept character names and only basic elements of the original. However this remake will bring a new generation into the BSG galaxy which is a good thing.  Overall I loved it all and even for me a fan of the original I came to grips with the new look and feel as well as story because it was well done.  I went to the doctor today and I don't have to go in yet. My numbers are getting a little better but I still feel like crap. So right now we are in a wait and see holding patern to see what shakes out over the next few weeks. I go back next week to see what is up and see if I have continued to improve.  Well I am out for the evening...Peace!

      I see that I have a loyal readership of around five people and I would like to increase that number...because I want to be popular damnit!  Gore endorsed Dean today officially...and he did it right 'round the corner from Bill's office in Harlem. Clark revealed today that he had been in touch with the former president indicating Bill and Hilary would be endorsing him.  The problem is that no one can deny the Clintons became the undisputed leaders in the DNC when in 92 they energized the party...however now they are both the problem. They have continued to move the party more centrist in their views and have resisted change...such as bringing Dean in to the inner sanctom or at least to recognize that he is the new face of the party and brings with him the opportunity to effect change not only in the DNC but the nation.  I am sure the powers that be in the DNC are running scared...as well they should be because they have single handedly taken the party from power and moved them to the outside.  Over all this flap the DNC is close to breaking and is having an internal war over what to do next. That is their biggest problem and that Dean isn't an insider and has so far refused to become one of them because that may alienate his core...not because he moved mainstream but means that he would become exactly one of the people he is targeting.  Dean has made mistakes but I stated this on Brian's blog in his comments that I would rather see a flawed man in office that would begrudginly reconize mistakes and appologise (sp) Bush on the other hand has been become Republicans golden calf in which he can do no wrong and is as close to god as ditka fans portray him as god...and that is their greatest weekness...refusing to admit their wrongs. So this is where the Dems have a great shot...showing that the White house says one thing and then does another.  Kerry got in trouble for saying fuck..."I didn't realize he (bush) would fuck up iraq so badly." He said this in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine...the white house responded that they would hope he would retract that saying that cursing is not polite...  Well I got news for you kids...we should be screaming obsenities...it is far past the point of being polite and time to use real language.   I think it a lot of hubbub over nothing and really that is common language and really swearing is just fucking words...it isn't a sniper rifle aimed at them...curse words are just normal so why try and not use more colourful language. These words are used by most everyone and really only offends a small portion of the population because they to use that word.  The Daily Show with John Stewart got Bush good over this showing him at a rally with Cheney saying some swear word to him without realizing the mike was still hot...the hipocracy is just mind boggling....  Well I am going to see the doc tomorrow and I expect I will be going in soon. Perhaps tomorrow...and who knows how long I will stay.  Until next time kids.  Mike

      I want to send a quick thank you out to Pam. Thank you for your kind words...and I still think about you a lot and hope all is well over in your neck of the woods.  The love that has been shown over the past few days by my friends and family has really touched me deeply. I am greatful for all the experiences that I have had and the journey that has brought me to this point in my life.  I have but a few regrets in my life and really none of them are that huge. Mostly it is regrets on how I treated some people or what I have said to them...but I regret none of my actions.  Some of you have been through thick and thin with me and I want to express my deepest gratitude towards those who have been there. I love you all and I am thankful that I have people like ya'll in my life.  I still haven't made any decisions on what I am going to do yet. Partly because I am very torn between what I believe and what I know is logical. So I will break it down for ya'll here and I would appreciate any opinions that you have. Everything that I am going to write comes from my view and is what I would hope be a critical look at my views and my feelings.  There is a large part of me that does not want to go through a transplant procedure and it comes from several different places.   I will start with the easiest of the two arguments as I see it. Part of it has to do with just numbers.  Depending on blood type (I have never known my blood type but my mom is B and my dad is O I think) and tissue type I could end up waiting for up to three years (less or more depending on really someone else dieing that is compatible). That part scares me because really for all of my life I have been living under a time allotment. When I was much younger basically the guidance was that I would live for 16 years (as most CF patients at the time lived to about 16). As time has passed the treatment for the disease has gotten better thus increasing average lifespans for CF patients like myself to the mid 20's and early 30's without much illness. So I have been pretty dead on overall with the average.  Of course there are people who live longer (there are several that are alive now in their 40's and 50's) and there are some who die very quickly (die by the age of 10 or less). It all has come down to what your particular Genotype is. There are several hundred genotypes of CF. With the least affected people (with a very mild genetic anomaly) that live for a very long time, and those with very severe genetic anomalies that don't live long at all. This has led to new treatments and courses of action depending on your genotype. Well right now the CF foundation and the doctors are forming real treatment for the different genotypes. Why they haven't done this until now is beyond me but they are now seeing that they can more effectively target treatment based on what type of CF you have. Knowing the genotype in the future will give doctors a better gauge of how long people will live and what treatments are most effective.  The other part of the numbers side is that only 50% of transplantees live past five years. Some live longer, some die shortly after the transplant. Again they are starting into studies with genotypes to figure out who will do best and what treatment course would be needed for the different types. Also the rejection drugs get better each year so the percentages will most definitely change over time. There are now transplantees that are 10 and 12 years out with no signs of illness.  The transplant itself does not cure you. It merely replaces the defective part with a normal functioning part. Whatever part you replace no longer has CF. So you get your lungs and heart replaced and they are normal but the rest of the body still has CF. So you could die of other complications from CF such as your intestines breaking down completely or liver or kidneys. It is all a crap shoot. I think that in the future we will see more and more CF patients coming in for kidney and liver transplants because of the treatment of the disease. We use very heavy anti-biotics routinely and those anti-biotics kill of both organs when used at the dosages and frequency that we have to use them.  From a numbers aspect it is about even. So I cannot base my decision on that alone. If they could tell me that I was 80% likely to be around for more than five years than it would be easier because that is more of a guarantee than a warning and I would definitely go ahead with a transplant.  The second reason and perhaps the more difficult of the two has to do with how I have lived my life thusfar and what I have to offer down the road.  I cannot predict with any certainty that I will go on to do great things. Really no one can so that becomes somewhat of a moot point but it is something that I take into consideration. More from a tools and what I have already done aspect.  There is no doubt to those who know me that I have always lived in the now and done many things that others would consider endangering my life.   I have done lots of drugs. I love drugs. I really do. I have done so many that the list is longer than the ones I haven't done (and those that I haven't done I would love to try). The drug use that I have participated in was always recreational and never ruled my life (as many can tell you that have known me). I was always the one pushing the limits and going well past the point of common sense. An eigth was good but a quarter is better, and half an ounce is even better. I rarely bowed out because of health problems (and when I did it was just because I knew I needed to heal). Not once did any of the drugs rule my life...partly because I not a hugely addictive person. Its not to say that I didn't like them or I couldn't become addicted...but as many of my friends know I was always cheap. I never wanted to spend money on things alone...I would often pool in with people...or if I bought something I almost always shared with my friends (and strangers).  I pissed away a college education. I can explain why but it isn't a good explanation. I always held the belief that I would be dead by now (by age 25 in my mind) so I never threw myself into education full force. I did enough to eek by and then it turned into "well fuck it I won't be here much longer". This reasoning actually has led me almost always into trouble. Whether trouble with the law, family, or health.  Its not to say that I didn't learn anything. Actually I learned a lot and I consider myself an educated person (ableit without a degree). Really I don't have but maybe 20 core credits to get done. I have around 110 completed...but most are non-specific. Partly because I just wanted as much as possible but also as diverse as possible. I took a GIS class (geogralhic infomation studies/systems)...not because I needed it or it would count for anything. I took it because I liked the teacher and I though it would be interesting and it was. I loved that class. The computer knowledge that I have gained over the years paid off in spades in that class...not only for myself but for other students (like being able to look up census data and formating it for presentation on the computer).  I never took college seriously and that is why I was in for such a long time. I would love to finish it just to say I finished it, but it honestly doesn't bug me that much that I don't have a degree. I take my grandmothers position on it...you go to college not for a degree but to learn how to learn. I accomplished that goal. I accomplished the development of my mind to think of things critically and on what steps I need to take to accomplish any task that is presented to me. I take pride in that because I know many people who went to college (some finished, some didn't) that really never developed that skill. I have friends who just can't problem solve and when something comes up they panic and make poor decisions or no decisions prefering to let others make them or do the work.  This ties into my view or feelings on transplant. I have lived a good life overall. Sure it hasn't been roses, but overall I made great friends, had a few good times, and expanded my knowledge, as well as lived in relative comfort. So there is not much lacking in my life (except maybe hot monkey sex).  If I were 12 or 16 then I would go ahead with it because I hadn't lived life up to that point. However I am 26 and I have done more things than most accomplish in a lifetime (normal one that is). I have traveled (not as much as I would like), I have lived (not as comfortable as I would have liked), and done many things (not all that I wanted but close). So continuing on would only diminish what I have done...because it may be downhill from here. What will I do if the transplant succeeds? Where will I go? How will I live?  Which brings me to a rant...I cannot see why anyone in their 50's or 60's would expect someone to give a kidney. You have lived your life folks...exit stage left gracefully. Accept the fact that you are older and worn out...so be thankful for the time you had on this Earth.  So that is what is going into the thought process. Again I haven't ruled anything in or out. I just am mulling over what I want to do.   Well I love you all and I hope to get to see some of you before things get bad...as they will and I want people to remember me (whatever the outcome) as I was...a fun person that loves to have a good time...even if it isn't the best thing for my health.  Peace!

      Today was pretty eventfull...I took my sister out to where my mom works at Fed-Ex the Pittsburgh Ground Headquarters...she was going to sit with her and spend some time. While I was out in the Robinson Towne Centre (they actually use those spellings which are olde english spellings...but nonetheless good spellings) I got some of my gift shoping done. I still have more to do but overall I am nearly done...and so far I have only spent about a hundred bucks total. Did I ever mention I am a tight bastard? Well I am...I have saved a little money but I really don't want to spend it so I am not going too.  The anti-biotics I am on are seriously taking a toll...the one med smells like cat piss and I have to infuse that...eeesh! My urine has turned a lovely shade of canary yellow...almost orange and it smells horrible...I know way to much info.  I just back upstairs because my poor poor Rufus is sick and has been for a few days. Yesterday GM woke up to a pile of gew that my dog had shit out on the floor. Now Rufus has never before shit in the house...he peed one time but never this. All of today he has been puking and just a little bit ago had those runny bloody stool thing. Good thing my sister the Vet. is here...she thinks he has something seriously wrong. I think that whatever it is...if it is a bug he got it from this little toy poodle my sister brought with her here to get a home for. Now mind you that the two of them didn't play or really get near each other so much...but still he could have got something...but most likely not there.  My sister thinks that he is bleeding in his gut...and if that is indeed what the problem is then we may have to put him down...and I don't want to do that at all...because I do love my dog a lot...I just hope it is some bug that we can kill easily and get him back up and running.  This sucks that my dog is really sick. We are taking him to the vet that my sister did an externship with...partly because she can keep and eye on him and they will treat us right down there...so I am thankful to have that otherwise the bill would be huge!  Ok...now where was I. Oh yeah the Seatle Washington WTO protests from 1999. I have seen several documentaries that have been put together by Seatle IndyMedia...they were informing but disturbing.  The WTO is short is where government heads of state and corporations from all over the world get togethe and basically discuss where things are to be done...how to get the people to go along with it....and of coarse make the US Companies the only ones who would really profit from this...well not the companies so much but rather the CEO's and board members for those companies...as a matter of fact this is where deals are struck for getting another "garment mill" (sweat shop) from some far flung place in the world...think upper third world, and all middle world nations. So the business man from Gap goes in and negotiates a deal with a Phillipino contracter to make a pair of jeans for 4 US dollars...the worked of those factories rarely recieve more than a few dollars a day in wages while the boss's make all the money. Gap then turns around and sell the same jeans for 30 dollars...that is a hell of a markup I tell you.   The WTO is designed obstensively to promote free/fair (I added fair) trade between nations. As it stands now we take advantage of smaller nations, plunder, loot, and pollute them then leave when someone else offers a better per unit cost.  In 1999 The WTO was meeting in Seatle WA was nearly shut down and because of the protests (people flew in from Korea and many other nations to protest). The shut it down. With this civil unrest many of the third world leaders pretty much walked away and said (even brutal dictators) we can't force this down our people's throats and have them like it at all...  During the protests and marches there were up to 50 Thousand people...and of coarse you have the dumb "anti-everything" people who go around causing havoc and breaking windows at a Starbucks (in Seatle you dumb fucks...Starbucks home!) and several other places. The vast majority were peacefull and did nothing but Civil Disobediance excersizes. Again such a minority (maybe 20-50 kids max out of 50 thousand protesters) that the rally and march was by all intents peaceful.  After they stopped the first day of real negotiations (many delegates had to make their way through the protestors (where many of the third world leaders say the unrest and changed position on the WTO.).  After that day the mayor made a 25 block zone in the city that there could be no protests, no signs, no buttons, stickers, or anything that would talk against the WTO...that is when things started going wrong. The police repeatedly fired their tear gas (even though they annouced that they weren't deploying Pepper Spray of Tear Gas) cannisters into the crowd almost alway deliberatly at people. Now those things come out pretty fast so getting one in the gut or chest would knock a good size person down...then the cannister explodes on targer and out pours gas...now getting hit by one of these cannisters is dangerous no doubt...and they could be used in a manor that would kill people (thank god the police no longer know how to shoot and properly handle a firearm.  The third day by mayoral decree no gas masks were allowed to be sold to protesters, a protester with one on can be arrested. So they basically said you haven't a fightin chance here, give up, and go home. But the video footage of the protest was very informative.  80% of Police department here in the states have a paramilitary (swat) team. Their overall sucess rate for all of them is in the fifty percent region. Sure I believe we need SWAT teams but to be used very sparringly and only when they are needed.  The banning of getting gas masks pushes a little to far.  Big labor unions have been becoming more buddy buddy and it is about time. As one put it "we are fighting the same fight, we may not agree with them on everything (as they don't us) the basic concept is there and once all the little groups get put together they will be unbeatable.  The steelworkers came up for the Seatle protest and marched the first day...and in trying to get more people to walk from the union many of them said "what the fuck good will that do?). Once they saw their colleagues being gassed and kids being kicked around those holdouts came out in force and again locked the downtown core up again.  A similar thing happened this year The WTO protesters shut it down (it was in Miami I think).  For us the good guys to win we need to embrace the unions and once elected push some of their agendas because they are not politicaly tilted...but facts. We don't have to agree on everything but we need to make the first steps to start on the road...so that is good news for us all (and for a little history on me...for a long time I didn't like Unions. Mainly because of the Teamsters because they were and are crooked as hell (although they are straightening out). Once we join our forces and talents we can effect change.  Well I have about three pages more to write about this but I won't...so!  Peace! (oh yeah and happy holidays...for me I will be glad to get my shopping done).

      Ok one last thing unless something really interesting pops up.  Dean has released his new domestic plan calling it "A New Social Contract for America's Working Families". I will provide a link to the entire speech/plan.  Reading it is like a dream come true and in the correct wording so that no real American can look at it and say "hey that isn't good".  He proposes health care for all based off of the insurance government officials get right now...a nationalised health care. Only one other candidate has proposed what in our country is a radical idea (even though all industrialised nations have national health care save us).  Having thought about this a lot in the past year or so I realize that it will be difficult to get people to buy into it and companies and insurers will most certainly denounce it as socialism or communist...and maybe it is socialism...but we already live in a quasi-socialist state already.  Dean would repeal the Bush Tax cuts (oh dear raising taxes...but in reality it isn't a raise in taxes for most people as they didn't make enough for the Tax cuts to help them anymore than maybe a couple hundred a year...which the average middle class cuts amounted to around 300 a year...that is not much...and not really a stimulus for the economy because for many this money went to pay bills down...so most of it wasn't spent on products.  To make it work the Tax Cuts would have to be repealed...and companies would have to pay into the system what they were previously paying into private insurers...instead that money goes to the government for health care (some might call it a tax but in reality it is shifting funds that go to private insurers to a federal agency that we all benefit from). People would also pay in as well but their contribution may only be a hundred or two per month far below the average of 680 a month for private health care that is flakey at best.  The money can be raised and used properly...but only with our, The American people, lobbying and really making a stand from it.  In this document or speech Dean again stresses that almost all politicians say they will do this or that for the public when they rarely carry out what they say...and Dean says basically I can get to the white house but I can't effect change without continuing support from the public.  He just said he can't promise anything but will instead inlist our voice in the debate for such large projects...and that is the right thing to say and do.   Dean promise and plan.

      Today I spent a few hours at the hospital getting my first dose of a anti-biotic I have never had...they needed to monitor me and see if it would kill me...it didn't.  Really nothing much happened...I informed my sister of what is going on around the globe in our name...and she was kinda surprised.  Basically I gave her the simplified version of why we went to Iraq and Afghanistan seeing that the major media has never really taken on what is really the motive behind it all...and they probably never will.  Again nothing much happened so that is all I can write about...oh one thing I can go see Daniel because we are both negative for the new nasty little bug...but to be sure we have to keep three foot between us...which is good news. I am going to try for early this next week to see her.  The new meds are already taking their toll...so I don't know what is going to happen for work. Really I think that I am almost spent there because now I have new meds and they are harder on my system overall. I will call my boss tomorrow and inform her and tell her that I can work...but I can't be there for a long time...plus I have to avoid the public as much as possible because of the Flu...even if I wanted to get a flu shot I can't because I am already on a razor edge with my health and the shot would most certainly shove me right off the cliff.  LOTR: The Return of the King...rocked...go see it you won't be dissapointed for sure. The complete series (the three films) will most definitely go into many people's top 25 movies of all time...Peter Jackson did a superd job on them...even if he doesn't end up getting best picture or Director...the film is literaly...all three films are literally some of the best films of all time. Everything was done with great detail and was dead on...he stayed as close to the book as possible without having the films run four or five hours each. These films are long films...and LOTR: Return of the King is very long...but you do not notice it at all because you watch it and yearn for the next scene to see how things play out. If I would have been alone I would have cried like a baby because it was just so moving and so well performed...so go see it.   Peter Jackson...you are most definitely one of the best directors ever and the masterpiece that you have created with this series will stand the test of time...people fifty or a hundred years from now will look back and watch the movies and they will hold up due to your hard work...and the hard work of the talented people you surrounded yourself with from the actors down to the grips and special effects people. There is no other series of movies that is better...kudos!  Peace out

      Ok so I did want to post something else tonight.  A lot of speculatio has been floating around on what to do with Saddam. Should we execute him, should we turn him over the Internation War Court, or should we let the Iraqi's decide?  This is one area where I stray from the liberal view...sure the Death Sentence doesn't really prevent crime as the criminal is to caught up in the moment to comprehend the consequences...and many crimes happen in the heat of passion or for simple retaliation. I belive in the Death penalty nonetheless if the trials were fair and the verdict returned without the specter of any kind of impropriaty by the prosecuter...however I am not for killing of "slow" (retards) no matter how bad the crime...and I disagree with courts mandating a juvenile stand trial as an adult (my logic is...they can't join the army, buy a pack of smokes, or go to the local bar...so they are still children).  So what would I do with Saddam? Well I wouldn't kill him that is for sure as he would become a martyr....and that would be bad, very bad.   Also I want to make the disclaimer that I also do not believe in torture of any kind...but I will be flexable on this one in this case.  I submit that Saddam be put through the worst of torture however we keep him alive to we can continue to do that for a long while...then we execute him. Let him feel the pain and terror he inflicted on the people of Iraq...and I also submit that he be tried by the Iranians as well as he committed horible terror on those people.  I hate that I have to think like that...but ya' know sometimes you just gotta get midevil on some people...people that are obviously guilty and they deserve the worst punishment possible.  Again swooping in to talk about/for Dean. The Dems keep on attacking him and have great what would seem like armour peircing ammo...it really isn't.   Dean never said we would be better off with Saddam in power...he did say and is correct that we should have never gone in the first place. The evidence at best was sketchy, at worst it was all forged and manipulated.  He was pleased with the capture but felt that we should have never gone in to get him. I guess stupidity goes a long way in this world because they are going against Dean with the lame less than lethal weapons they have in their arsenal.  So to the rest of the Dems...fight Bush, not each other...there is way to much riding on this election.

      Ok so todays Doctors appointment confirmed my worst fears...I am most definitely very ill indeed. My lung functions dropped almost 20% across the board...oh yeah talk about breathin'!  He wanted to really bring me in but he has no room at the inn...the hospital is full and what they would do I can do at home...so he didn't press to get me in...also the holidays and he wanted me to be with family and save my patience...  They are starting me on an old school anti-biotic...something that my doctor hasn't prescribed in many years...at one point it was the most popular drug out there...then because the drug companies weren't making money off of it they stopped producing it...which when that happens the FDA drops its certification of the drug so it becomes no longer safe for humans (even though it was used for years)...currently the only place making it is a company in Mexico and its use in the US is limited to Vets...they use it on horses and other animals...so I am going to be taking a drug that the FDA no longer sees as safe...yay!  The only bad side effect (and it is so remote that it really isn't even a problem or worry) is that it can kill your bone marrow or rather shut it off so it doesn't work.  I am very weary of it all folks. Very.....

      Well today has just been a shitty day. First of all I woke up and was sick as a friggin dog. I mean I got out of bed and started hacking and couldn't stop for nearly an hour. Blood and phlegm was coming out and there is still more down there sitting waiting to come up and cause problems.  I get to go to the docs tomorrow for a scheduled appointment...I think I will end up in the hospital because I can't breath...I am so behind and feel so starved for oxygen that it has resulted in a pounding headache and just a general level of discomfort.  The crowing of the Republicans is now becomming deafening...and the Democratic candidate Kerry, Lieberman, and Gephart have all decided to go after Dean.  Has Dean been hurt by this? Nope...the train keeps on rollin' on. Why? Because Dean was against the war....he was against it because it was unprovoked. Some would say "well Saddam was in violation of many Security Council Resolution from the UN...someone had to do it". Ok...it that is your argument then why haven't we done something in Israel? Why haven't we ridden in on our white horses to stop the bloodshed in Monrovia or The Congo?   Why? Because Iraq has vast oil reserves. Yeah I know it is a cliche' and every liberal has said that...but it is the truth...or at least the closest thing anyone can come up with since there aren't WMDs (even if there are...them being as hidden as they would have to be would mean that they wouldn't be that threatening to us now would they...because they would have to go diggin' for them just to use them)...Democracy...HAHAHAHA!!!! The Iraqi council submitted a plan to implement voting by next summer...it was rejected because "there isn't a good census reference point"....well they had a census done not all that long ago so they have pretty good numbers to work with...  Everytime the Administration or some Right Wing Nutbar Hawk says it is about something new not but a few days later is that dispelled and a new reason is formulated.  What really gets me is that there are people who think we are safer!!! What planet are they living on? Not this one for sure!  Ok now what the military and law enforcement agencies around the world should be doing is surgical, precision targeting of terrorists and cells...not invading sovereign nations in the middle east where we will happen to piss off a lot more Arabs and push them to be terrorists because of our actions.  Someone made a good point that we won't know how these policies will play out ten years or more from now...well we kind of do in all fairness. The war on terrorism will become like the war on drugs...something we can never win because there will always be demand (or with terrorism wrongs that need to be righted in some people eyes). We will spend billions upon billions compared to their relatively small resource pool....yet they will continue to win just like the drug lords. All the while we will be racking up debt and that is what will break us...not attacks or civilians dieing...but a crushing debt.  Many people feel safer...buy I don't...not because I don't like Bush...or that in all honesty once he gets his teeth into something he is like a pitbull...but in the end he is easily distracted and his policies are fracturing at the seems...  Another thing that I saw today was that people think the economy is getting better. Well according to some economic indicators it may well be getting better...but all of those economic indicators only indicate how those in power or wealth are doing...not your average Joe taxpayer.  Sure the DOW is up...but let me remind people the DOW is like pretend money when you make it...it is only real money when you loose it. The DOW is like going to the races and placing a bet on how companies (or horses) did in the past hoping they will do well or better in the future.  How are these companies getting their stocks higher? Well for one they have been streamlining operations for three years now, laying people off, and reducing back inventory. Worker productivity is still rising...but can't continue because people break. Right now it looks like one person is going the job of three...and in many cases it is that simple. So in order to add a job to this economy an employer has to actually create the work for three persons to justify hiring someone to do those jobs. However it doesn't mean they will hire more people...actually they will shove that extra work onto it employees and the work will get done and it will appear that worker productivity will go up...it is a visous cycle that will not get any better anytime soon.  People blame our woes on outsourcing. I don't think that is so much the case. Sure we have lost many jobs to that...but we must not forget that companies aren't beholding to the employees...but rather the stockholders and anything that can be done to reduce costs will be taken so that profits will rise. I can't fault that logic at all. It is a pain in the ass and hurts us...but it is a fact of life...we can't compete on some of the industries and only remained at the top as long as we did because of shear luck.  I will save "illegal imigrants" for later...and I will counter Lou Dobbs on this one...because he is for the most part wrong.  Well that is all for the evening I am pooped and sick...so I am going to get some rest.  Peace

      Sis is finally here...and I am going to bed cause I feel like shit...  Not much happened today outside of the nonstop coverage of our great "victory". Grep Proops who was on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn tonight put it bluntly "how perfectly timed to have him seeing that Halliburton was on the cover yesterday and now we catch Saddam...how conveniant." My thoughts exactly.  It was a great day for the world...but it would have been better had he been captured by a truly international force. This was an invasion...the same kind as that of Poland by Germany in the beginning of WW2. That was later tried in court as an unprovoked attack and they were found guilty.  I wonder since we are a society of law (ha! what BS!)...I wonder if our leaders would submit themselves to the Hague courts for a similar trial. I doubt it...cause after all god called on us to do this...or at least that is what Bush heard in his head.  The war was unjustified...but even from trajedy we can find some good...and the only good is that Saddam won't be returning to power ever. That is a plus...but not something worth going to war over for sure.  Peace

      Well the past 24 hours has been a real rollercoaster of a ride.  We caught Saddam Hussein. Rather the 4 ID (Fourth Infantry Division out of Fort Hood Texas) caught him...and they caught him without so much as a shot being fired.  When I first got up this morning my mom asked if I had heard...well no I hadn't so I guess I woke up to a pleasant surprise.  Yes it was a pleasant surprise. I have been against this from the very beginning, but at the same time I was really rooting for the troops. I have a great deal of admiration and respect for our armed services. They tirelessly protect us and in general the military is very honorable (and would be more so if it didn't have the civilian leadership that it currently has).  Back when Uday and Qusay were killed I was a little miffed about that. Not that they were killed mind you, but they could have been taken alive and why the military didn't is beyond me. So for them to catch Saddam without any shooting was really a great task and they should be praised because they didn't have itchy trigger fingers (as most do now because of the daily onslaught of carnage there).  At first I thought it might be a double...but then they said DNA samples prove it is him (not being one to trust the government I am still a little hinky....but I will take this one at face value).  It is a little upsetting because the timing is perfect for Bush and crew...what better way to shore up your support and approval ratings with his capture (leaving me with a what if question...like did they put off actually capturing him until Bush needed a boost?).  That is why I am a little miffed because he will crow about it and tout it as a victory brought on by his policy.  Some have said that Dean is the loser in this...but I find that contradictory because Dean wasn't for Saddam...he was against a war that had little merrit and has turned out to be a bloody mess.  All of this amounts to a hill of beans really when you start to analyze what is actually happening on the ground there.  First is the fact that there are a great many resistors (freedom fighters if you will) that hated Saddam and for far better reasons than we did. This capture will only insure that if the resistors gain control they won't be overthrown and killed by Saddam and his cronies. Now they have something to really fight for...their country without the spector of Saddam. So attacks by this group probably will not be lessened, but perhaps increased.  Second are the insurgents. These are basically right wing Muslim nuts that are there to kill Americans. These people come from all over the region. They are fundamentalists and they had no love for Saddam (outside of the fact that he would send money to Palistinian families whos sons or daughters committed a suicide bombing against Israel). Actually Saddam hated those folks and killed many of them whenever he got the chance (he did more to fight the "war on terror" in that respect). His capture doesn't affect these people...it may perhaps embolden them to do more.  Third is the Saddam Fadayeen (sp). These were the Saddam supporters. They were hard core killers in the regime and continue to be now as they fight the Americans. Now this group could go two ways as I see it. They could lay down there arms and stop the violence (as I hope they will), but they could also step up attacks in the hope they can get their leader back in power. So really this group is truly unknown...I can't tell what they will do at all because there are two ways to go.  Now I wish that it would be as simple as catching him and the attacks stop alltogether...but we all know that isn't going to happen. The public is behind its troops and we hope for the best and that they will come home safely. Again they all deserve a round of beer on the public's tab as they are performing the best they can in the situation considering that they have really limited support from the Civilian leadership in the Pentagon. They need more troops but Rumsfeld simply won't have any talk of that.  Again it is marvelous we caught him alive...but we all know the war is still going on and we will see more American (and Allied forces) death before it is all over.  So to our troops...that's the way boys and we hope to see you home soon...preferrably in one piece.  Peace (and we love you armed forces...you keep us safe and you make us proud).

      I bought Noam Chomsky's "Hegemony Or Survival, America's Quest For Global Domination"...of the chapter I have read it is a great book. It reads exactly as he speaks...very deliberately and cautiously to bring you to a level of anger yet not have you boil over.  I think I will like the book.   I am sick. I had to leave work early today...I couldn't breath. I would walk maybe ten foot and start coughing and hacking and was totally out of breath. I hate that. I sounded like I had the flu or TB...people were giving me a wide berth.  When I got home I hit the pipe trying to catch up...but it has been slow to recover. Another really strange thing is that my feet and hands are numb...I barely can feel them. I am calling the doctor tomorrow and will probably be going in tomorrow evening.  So I am just worn out. I am going to stop writing now because I can barely string together three words without passing out. I am tired and ill...so!!  Goodnight :-)

      Lately I have been hearing more and more from Noam Chomsky. Many consider him the premier intellectual of our time. I happen to agree. I don't agree with all his thinking partly because I guess I am still young and stupid (nieve'), however he speaks the truth and frankly if you are a flag wavin' American with the matching lapel pin what he says may frighten you or drive you into denial.  I am by no means anywhere near the level of understanding of Chomsky but I am getting there. I would really love to see him speak. I have caught a few of his speeches on FSTV and I must say that outside of being monotone he is a wonderful speaker. The way he presents things is not in an alarmest way, or angry...but rather he just presents the information and allows you to choose to believe or not. I think his main goal is to get people thinking. He certainly makes me think. Again he just presents the information pretty much without emotion (I think and get the feeling that he deliberately leaves out passion and emotion so that those feelings will not cloud the mind of the listener. To cloud the mind of someone is easy. It is all in intonation and passion).  Years ago Chomsky recieved much flak for supporting the right to free speech of a man who has the theory that the Halocost never happened (which we all know isn't true...it did indeed happen). He wrote a short bit that was put on the flap of the book that basically said that people should be free to speak, and that unless that is protected then debate doesn't happen, ideas are stiffled, and solutions may be missed. He never said he agreed with the man or his ideas but regardless fought for his right to speak.  Now the gentleman he wrote this for was a Frenchman (ahhh those evil Frenchy bastards!) and he was sued by many different organizations for his book and ideas. I am sure that I would find the book and the ideas invalid but I still recognize that he should have the right to say it regardless of how tasteless it may be.  From that point on Chomsky (who is Jewish I believe) was seen as an anti-semite when indeed he isn't. This kind of blackballed him and set him on the sidelines for TV and as an expert (even though he is the predominant expert on these things). Even under these circumstances he has still been a voice in the wilderness for many who are dissalussioned.  The reason he doesn't get on TV all that often in the mainstream is because he carefully words his responces and instead of simplifying things down to a soundbite he actually answers questions in great detail. We all know that the press loves to keep things dumbed down and as simple as possible because god forbid that people actually stop to think and ponder things. It just doesn't jive with making simple answers...instead he answers things and simple questions he may answer with an eight minute responce to answer the question and then qualifies it with evidence or stories that he has put together.  If you ever want to read something and learn go get some Chomsky...he has written many books that deconstruct what we see and hear daily. I know I will be looking for some of his material tomorrow at the book store.  Here is a GNN  interview  with him. It is a good read and gives you an introduction to him and his thoughts. Again you may not agree with it all but it will get you to thinking.  That is something that I have been finding of great value to myself. Reading as many sources as possible and coming up with my own ideas...and those ideals are pulled from as far right as the  Heritage Foundation  and  NRA  to the left leaning  GNN  and  The Nation  as well as  Commondreams.   Another great source of daily info that I get in my email is this   The Daily Mislead (Misleader)  and   Bushgreenwatch.   All these are good reads...and yes it is strange that I would have the NRA and The Heritage Foundation. These groups are far right leaning (and by the way I am an NRA member...because that for all their wackiness I believe that we should have the right to bear arms...regardless of what they may be...even howitzers.). Also to know your enemy is good so reading some of the rights ideas from Heritage Foundation gives the average Joe the opportunity to look into what they are preaching...crazy as it may be.  I suggest people read and form their own opinions. It is the only way for people to become truly informed.  Peace

      Well I am well into downloading Black Adder...a britcom that was absolutely hilarious...it starred Rowin Atkinson also known as Mr. Bean. Adder was his first big gig and he wrote and starred in it...a good comedy.  I have Season 1 and most of Season 2...I am working on Season 3 now. I am getting them for my mom...she loves Black Adder.  Well I am going to read my news and then hit bed because tomorrow I am meeting with dad at lonestar steak house and then I have to be at work by 2...so tomorrow will be a long day.  Peace

      Just got back from the extended family's place. Damn I didn't know I had that many relatives...good thing too because of the high chance for genetic matches for body parts...well not perfect but better than the public at large.  All this was on my moms side...I met third/fourth cousins and all sorts of people...very strange.  Tomorrow before work my sister and I are meeting dad for lunch at Lonestar. It will be good to see him.  Well I may update later...who knows.  Peace to you and yours.

      Well colour me suprised. I got a bunch of neat things for Christmas. I got a new pair of jeans and a pair of Sponge Bob housepants. My mom got me the Alien Quadrilogy (all four movies, two versions of each, and 50+ hours of additional footage) and my grandmother got me a portable DVD player with a 7" widescreen so that when I go to the hospital I can at least have something to watch. Mom also got me an office chair...very comfy.  Of course I got the obligatory money...some from GM, Grandpa, and my dad sent us something (but it hasn't gotten here yet).  All in all it has been a good holiday...and so far not to much stress. We just have tonight to go and if we make it through that all will be well.  Hope everyone had a good holiday.  Peace

      Merry Christmas to everyone out there...it feels like just yesterday I was a little kid enjoying Christmas with my family in relative peace. Not this year...har har har.  As I get older I find myself becoming ever more cynical to this holiday and I guess it is because I live in the real world compared to most people. I am not belittling their world, but it is this sacharin coated fruit cake of life that people have gotten used to. I don't know if that made sense...well it really didn't to me but lets run with it.  I really hate the holidays and it wasn't because I didn't get the G.I. Joe aircraft carrier when I was a kid. I hate them because of what they have come to symbolize.  The holidays have basically been hijacked by one of two groups...the capitalists and the Christians...both equally evil in my book. Both groups attempt to monopolize this one time wonderful holiday and it is sad.  From my years of learning (yes I have learned some things) I know that Jesus wasn't born in December. From the shows that have been on lately it is doubtfull he was even born in Bethlehem. The Bible goes a long way to explain why he would have been born there but in reality the system at the time wasn't so backwards that people had to travel to their birthplaces to be counted. The Romans were nothing if they weren't ruthlessly efficient. So having all these people all of a sudden moving about to get to their birthplaces would have been a logistical nightmare...and again the Romans were efficient.  Another tidbit...people were named (especially in the Mid-East) something like Tobias of Galilee or Pud of someplace. They went by their names and birthplaces...Jesus was known as Jesus of Nazareen (sp) making it likely that he was born there and not Bethlehem. The Bible moves his birthplace basically because earlier in the Bible it states that the son of god would be born in Bethlehem. It is all really interesting history because if you strip religion from it you find that the Bible has many holes in its stories and frankly doesn't add up. That points to the fact that facts and events were changed to fit a concept that the early church had.  Capitalism has hijacked the holiday as well demanding that we shower each other with gifts. Who doesn't like gifts? I sure love them...but must we save it all for one or two days of the year (Christmas and Birthdays)? The answer of coarse is no. We can give to each other anytime we please but for the sake of relatively new tradition we save it all for those days.  The holidays to me are a time where you get together with friends and family and just enjoy each other. Unfortunately because of all the stress of giving gifts and what Christianity places on people we often loose site of that and just end up treating each other like shit.  The above was all I could come up with as I don't have the energy to really talk all that much about it.  We went to the Cirino's tonight and had a nice meal and enjoyed each others company. It is nice to have friends like that. I consider them my extended family as they do me.  I am tired already and today offers to be just plain crazy...but I hold out hope for some sanity in it all. We will see.  Just a quick note to the person who responded in my comments section below. I never have wished anything bad on anyone nor would I...in fact I have very few people that I flat out hate and Brandon surprisingly isn't one of them. I feel indifferent towards him not really caring one way or the other. I do wish him the best in his life...because he will need it. I do of coarse think that the punishment should have been more equitable but I can't change that nor would I have made stories up to get him in any jam. That isn't my style, never has been, never will be...even for the people I dislike or flat out hate. Why? Because I know that it will come back to bite me in the ass...plus I don't have the energy to let things bother me all that much.  I also wanted to quickly respond to one other thing. Brandon may have a great job where "he makes more in a day that I see in two weeks". Good...again I hope it is true because when he wants to be he can be very talented and driven (something he wouldn't regonize in myself...or any of his enemies) and with the right breaks may become someone of importance in the future. It is probably true that he will make more than I do partly because of a degree but mostly because outside of minor ailments he can work. I couldn't hold any job of merrit not because I am stupid or undeducated...but because I am often in the hospital...so working is difficult when you can't be at your job. So if it true great if it isn't I hope that it does become true because lord only knows that he is an unhappy individual (similar to myself in many regards).  Side note...I have written a lot for my book. I don't know how it will end or how it will play...but it will certainly be interesting to finish it. I even have a working title...so it looks like I can make it fly at some point. The hardest part of writing is that things flood in all at once and it is sometimes hard to get it all down, but I am working on that. I currently have two seperate things I am writing, one is on me, the other is fiction. So we will see.  Anyways people. Merry Christmas and I hope your holiday is a happy one. Don't forget to sign your organ donor cards because god forbid something happen, if it did then you can spread the greatest gift of all. The gift of life. Look for the link and get your card made up and ready.  Peace

      Today has been an extremely suck ass day as I spent most of it sick on the couch on the verge of puking. The meds are really working a number on me now.  My cough has turned from a dry unproductive one to this TB sounding death rattle...and I am weezing a lot. If you were to listen I am sure you would hear my lungs gurgling with shit in there. It really sucks ass.  What really sucks is that I still have to wrap presents and on Christmas day instead of it being calm it will be absolute madness. We have dinner here, then at grandpa's, then Cirino's, then cousin Max's (gandmothers cousin), then we have to try and catch dad...but I think that will be on Friday...which I have to work.  This holiday really blows because not only is it shitloads of driving...but I am also supremely ill and the only one who can get everyone anywhere....as Michelle simply doesn't know the area so I am her driver everywhere.  I will be glad when all this shit is over and I can go to the hospital to heal...my body is in desperate need of that.  I am afraid I won't make it through the next few days and by the end of it all I will be flat on my back, barely breathing with a headache.  Oh yeah...christmas time is fun...time to rejoice....time to pay homage to the great gods of capitalism.

      Well today was a long fucking day. My sis and I went out to finish some shopping. I hate that...the malls were madhouses and the people were nuts.  Driving could have been easily summed up as bumper cars...lots of little accidents and many idiots out driving.  I am still pissed.

      Well fuck me. I found out what Brandon got today...same thing that I got. 6 months home detention and five years probation.   Article   Now I am a bit miffed about that...you see he was far more involved in it all than I was and frankly I am pissed that I got as hard a sentence as I did seeing that I was just transportation for this whole mess.  I didn't get one single thing out of this meanwhile he recieved cash, tons of hardware....hell he probably still has the SCSI hard drives he scammed.  I was expecting him to actually see jail...and while I would never wish it on anyone I am pissed that he got the same sentence I did...I mean come on.  Oh well my home detention is over now and I am pretty much free again...its not like I can really do anything anyway...I am too sick now.  I guess that is what I am most pissed about...that the past six months that I have been on home detention has really been the last of my good health left and I have slid into the downward spiral all CF patients get into at some point. I would like to have had some more good times but seeing that I was on home detention I couldn't.  In the grand scheme of things I know that Brandon didn't learn his lesson at all. I am sure that he is all pissed that he got caught and that he has to be punished for it all. He will blame others, namely me, for him getting any time at all.   I would state here and now that I would have testified against him without reservation. It is just a shame that instead of the prosecutors actually doling out punishment in a fair and equitable way they just slapped him on the wrist.  The only thing that I wonder about is the fines and restitution he has to pay...because I have been paying on it all this time...which it hasn't been much but I still have paid on it. I doubt he will if he even was sentenced to pay.  I still wonder if I am to pay a third of the 96 grand that he profited from or do I pay all 96 grand. Basically that is what the prosecution said he stole and I transported with John as the guy who found drop points. I think that it is meant to be split three ways...but I don't know. However even on that I am pissed because everything that I got I handed over. Brandon didn't...plus he actually profited from it by selling Sound Blaster cards, RAM, modems, and I think video cards at one point. He got all that stuff in this deal and then sold it to people on Mack 3. So he made money...plus he ebayed some things off.  I am just miffed because he was the hub here and yet he got the same punishment I did as being the transportation.  Oh well at least I know what I did was wrong and won't be doing that again. I just wish that the punishment was more equitable.

      Ok I officially hate Christmas...actually it took me longer this year to get to the point of hating it...so I have done well.  I hate it because of the all the fake people who pretend that it has some great religious meaning when in fact the "birth of christ" probably didn't happen in December at all...instead Rome worked a census in October and November for tax purposes. Mary and Joseph travelled to Bethlehem for the census. So unless they got really lost (which hell Moses wandered around in the desert fourty years...can you imagine all the whining of the women for him to pull it over and get directions...and these women were Jewish so the whining must have been on the level of "oh my god I want to stab my ears because the pain would be a welcome relief to all this bitching") and missed the census then "jesus" was born in October or November.  Also these semi-religous retards almost always are the ones who are the most evil towards others in the Christmas holiday...so go figure.  The second reason is if they are going to celebrate it as "the birth of christ" then they need to stop the crass comercialism that goes along with this time of year...or leave religion out of it and just have it be a day that we all give gifts to each other.  At my little so called job as you folks may well know I work with Indians (India) and Jews from Israel so neither group really celebrates the holiday as most Americans do. Balu, the guy who runs the stand next to us (from India), is always asking questions about the holiday. Now I guess he wants to understand it from a Christian perspective and frankly I am not really good at explaining it in normal people terms because for years I have been against the holiday season. Also I am not a fanatic christian so I really can't speak with authority on the subject outside of my own beliefs.  I am a horrible consumer. Companies hate people like me. I don't shop and buy...I don't consume unless I need too. I know what I want so I get it when I need it (or can afford it) and the christmas holiday is the worst time of year for me because I don't shop.  This year though I did get gifts...I hate that but I know I should so I did...got most everything I needed too however I have a few odds and ends to pick up. Overall I will have spent maybe 150 total. Not bad for getting gifts for 12 or so friends and family.  I had to resist the urge to get things for myself...it was hard but I managed it well.  I wanna say something about healthcare...and actually it is from Ted Kennedy and a speech he gave after the Medicare thing happened. Here is the qoute as closely as I can recall. "Since the sixties the republicans have been trying to destroy medicare and privatize it. Well if privatization works then why do we need health care from the government in the first place?"  Right on the money there...why if privatization works so well that we have 40+ million without health care? The fact is you can't privatize this because it goes against what a profit driven company needs to be doing...any company.  A private insurer has to make a profit for its investors, and this means that they need to pay out as little as possible for health care. To do that they deny claims, they deny clients, the deny anything or anyone that costs them money.  As a person with CF I have run into this time and time again at jobs where sure I can get the insurance but I have to wait for up to five years to be covered on CF (and the can still deny it to you) and I am paying...and many insurers exclude pre-existing conditions...so in the private system I cannot be covered. That doesn't work does it?  It is the same for millions out there as well...so sure there may be many that don't have insurance because of no job...but the number is growing in the population that would have health care problems that are considered pre-existing.   So what is the answer? Nationalized health care. Period. All current moneys that companies kick into insurance bennefits for their employees plus their portion or copay per month goes into a nation pot. That pot would also include Medicaid/Medicare moneys that are allocated in the budgets. Only a minor adjustment would need to be made in the budget which would include probably more money from the Gov...but hey thats what we pay taxes for right?  While like every other American I hate taxes...partly because we don't see the money at work. However is I was guaranteed health care, better roads, and schools I would gladly pay up to fifty percent of my wages in taxes knowing that I will see some of that money at some point in forms of service to me.  Kucinich has an interesting view on it all...very similar to mine, and much better thought out really.  While on politics I must say that it would appear that the DNC is shitting big bricks over Dean. I firmly believe the DNC does not want to run any viable candidate clearing the road for Hilary in the 08' election...as it stands the opposition is weak (although growing grass roots style, offering a peace treaty the other candidates).  The only person I fear they might even run hard would be Wes Clark...and frankly he isn't that impressive. He would have a harder time winning because he really isn't all that eloqent in his speeches. Plus this is the candidate that Gillespi (DNC National Director), and the Clintons want.  Dean is the outsider in this whole thing. No one really nows what will happen frankly.  Good news though Dean is on his way and looks as if he will get the nod from Iowa and New Hampshire soon enough.  The DNC has to figure out what they will do...should they throw the money at Dean and give him a fighting chance. Also they need to imbrace this new Democrat. He balanced budjets in Vermont and 97 percent have health care as of now. The man is no fool.  On one side you have Gillespie, Bill, and Hillary Clinton. and these are but one piece of the pie. On the other side is Dean and Gore...both with much clout...so I thing it will be intersting snough.  If the DNC rejects Dean they will have made a huge mess even worse.  For running mates I can up with some names for it all. McCain...sure he is a republican but is old school and knows the system.  The other lark I could say would be Kucinich...in doing this it would get someone semi-honest in governent. By doing we would see green canidates make a good showing.  Either pick would be ballsy. McCain probably wouldn't take the job...but it would be great if he did (after all McCain recieved many honors in Vietnam don't know which ones off the top of my head...but they are there).  With McCain you will catch those Repubicans that are swing voters...and Dean needs them.  For Kucinich...while he many not bring big money he will stand by his policeics. His nomination would bring out the geens that would vote for Nader as even Nader recognizes the little guy and supportomg any of his environment causes and fly  Kucinch is a tad scary from time to tme...he can scowl with the best of the. I have no doubt he will always be more green (newer party for the environment.  Either way he chooses it will be wise because he is a smart/tough cookie. Kucinich gets the green vote back into the fray, and McCain is beloved by the people here. So to me either pick he may be great. He has the attention of the liberal mess up there.  McCain would help in bringing a moderate view to the state deparment. He has the chops to do it...so we should persue a change in foriegn policy.  Whomever gets the job, will be woried.  So that combined efforts can get us back to normal.  Rember Bush 1, Dems don't like a long term stay.  Vote for the Democrats at all costs just to get that madman out of controk here.  Peace

      Lemme say this was a long day. A very long day. A busy day.  My dog got sick so my sister (who will graduate in May from Vet school) took him to the office that she did her externship with here...he got something they don't know for sure what it is but all the treatments are the same...so he will be ok.  My meds are all finally in and they just kick my ass. I have never been so worn thin. I will be glad when the holidays are over...because I hate them. People are just so mean to each other. Plus I don't like Christmas.  Well I have to get up on the morning so goodnight all.

      Well over at Brassmask's site we have been having a spirited debate on whether or not we supported Saddam and Al-Queda and Bin-Laden...which we have supported all of the above. It can be proven and frankly anyone who would deny that we helped them out would have to be foolish.  It has been interesting because there is someone over there that has basically said it is all liberal lies that we supported them. I really don't know how someone could make that claim seeing that the government has even said it supported them both and made a mistake.  Some people I guess just have a really short memory.  Something that I posted over there and I have not posted here yet...I believe is this.  We have a real problem developing over in Pakistan. President Musarif (don't know the exact spelling) took the country in a coup in 1999. He did it very wisely because Pakistan had by then become a nuclear nation. He waited until they had them developed and then took over. Imediately the nation was put on our terrorist state list but we didn't really do anything to stop it all because they were a nuclear state.  We did filter much money through Pakistan and their ISSA (similar to our CIA) to the mujahideen in Afghanistan and the Taliban. We did this even after we placed them on our lists. We continued to put money through there because it was seen as an asset to us.  At the same time we were in direct negotiations with the Taliban government in Afghanistan to try and get a pipeline through the nation that would eventually lead down to a power station in India owned by Enron. This pipeline was turned down by the Taliban not all that earlier than 9/11/01.   However we still pumped in millions a year in aid to help them destroy poppy fields that supplied opium. We did this as part of our war on drugs. The money of coarse was used for other things but we will never know for sure where all of it went.   Well during all of this the Taliban and Al-Queda were relatively neutral towards Pakistan and Musarif...they didn't like them but didn't mind them...they just sort of left each other alone and it was a good arrangement.   After 9/11/01 Musarif aligned himself with the US and that basically knocked him off the fence for Bin-Laden and crew. He is now seen as a threat and they will do whatever they can to take him out. In fact he has had many attempts made on his life over the past few weeks. All attempts believed to be being made by Radical Islamic groups.  Now this is a problem because sooner or later he will be killed and the country will swing very violently over to a Islamic Fundamentalist government. This government will be in step with Bin-Laden and since Pakistan is a nuclear state Bin-Laden will at long last have access to nuclear weapons.  Now with our current precarious position in the middle east we really are not in any shape to take on this new emerging threat as well as continue our operations in Iraq and elsewhere. Our military is extremely overstretched and we would have to re-instate a draft to make up the numbers we need to fight this new fight.  Also we have a long standing tradition of not actually attacking nations that could possibly pose a threat to us as Pakistan may be actually able to with its nuclear arsenal. So we have that dimension to it all.  Now once Bin-Laden has nuclear weapons he will strike at three targets and you can quote me on it. These three targets will be Riyadh, Moscow, and Washington DC.  Riyadh because Bin-Laden holds that Saudi royals responsible for allowing the infadels to remain in the holy land. He is royally pissed off about that and has been stepping up efforts in Saudi Arabia to overturn the government and move it towards fundamentalism. They are already close to getting their way as the Saudi Royals have at best a precarious hold on power. So we can safely assume that is one of his prime targets. If he gets them the whole of the middle east will essentially fall into Muslim Fundamentalism.  Moscow he will attack because it is a relatively soft target and frankly Bin-Laden has even much more deeply rooted hatred of them than even the US. It will be revenge there. Plus the Chechans need the help and they are brothers in arms with the Muslims.  Washington DC is obvious. If he were detonate a nuke here we would surely fall into great disarray. We may not fall...but guaranteed our way of life will be over for a long long time and we will have serious problems for a lot of time.  Now the Bush administration will say that we can detect these weapons coming in, or hell any administration would say they could stop it. Well the plane fact is we can't detect nuclear weapons coming into the nation whether by cargo plane, ship, container, really anyway. The reason is because when you take the material and make it suitable for a weapon you essentially make it very stable (you don't want it being jossled and just blowing up) so it is really stable, which when stable like that it doesn't give off much free radiation. Also the weapons are also somewhat shielded for the protection of the people that have to handle them.  You can't detect them because they don't give off much radiation and as such attempting to detect them is pretty much impossible.   So if they were to get their hands on nukes there is no way we can actually protect against them getting here unless we lock down tight and frankly that is not in the same interest of freedom.   So we have some choices to make. Mark my words it is going to be hard over the next few years not withstanding whomever as president. All we can hope for is that we will not have a reactionary president that will make things worse and instead have one that will keep his head and make good sound decisions.  When the attack happens how will we respond. Under Bush we would declare nuclear war most definitely. We cannot do that because of the protections that are built into the Russian and our system of nuclear arsenals. We launch one off they launch one, basically locking us into a nuclear war that may not be able to be stopped. It is left over MAD (mutually assured destruction) protections built into the system. We may not intend to target Russian targets but their systems are not designed well enough to determine that for sure and they might launch on the fear that they are being attacked.  Regardless if we do attack the middle east with Nuclear Weapons and Russia does not repond we will still be screwing ourselves hardcore because like it or not we need the oil from the region for a time before we can transform into a hyrdrogen economy.   All of this is speculation of coarse...but I feel it is the most likely scenario that we are looking at and however you look at it it just looks bad for everyday americans and the common people of the world.   I hope I am wrong but I fear I am not.  May we all come out ok in the end...may we elect someone other than Bush so hopefully we won't retaliate with nuclear weapons making the situation worse for us all.

      I have watched four DVDs over the past 12 hours or so. Van Wilder, Dude Where's My Car, Planet of The Apes (the Tim Burton Remake), and right now I am watching The New Guy.  This little DVD player has been a godsent. I have been watching so many movies it is rediculous. I have watched almost all of my movies that I have. I have also gotten a few more and watched them as well.  My mom also got me a subscription to the Wal-Mart mail rental service for four months I am just waiting for the package of stuff to come in so I can start getting movies.  I think I will also subscribe to another movie club like I have in the past. Just so I can get some more movies at decent prices. It will be good to get into that again because I did that once and got a lot of movies that way.  Well I have a list to do for Jesse so we can build his new system. So peace out for now.

      Yesterday I actually had written out this big ass post but it was lost to the internet info monster...the post didn't take. It was about lies that the administration has told and then I was going to document them one by one.  You know what I am not going to do that because if you read the blog here I am sure that you are already aware enough to do your own research and see the lies for yourself. I am always willing to help research if there is something particular that you are interested in...but I am going to give ya'll enough credit to do your own research.  I have however gotten to thinking about something I said. It goes back to something that I have wanted to do for some time now but never gotten the balls to do it.   When all this crap started happening I wanted to start a website and basically do what I do here a lot. I wanted to bitch about the administration. I may still do that site or spin out the idea because it is universal and works for any administration really and can be used as a forum for change.  However the other night I stumbled across an idea. You all read it. So I started to look into it today to see what I would need to do to make it fly. Well I have found out some information and really it will be a little work but I can do it. Especially seeing that I have wireless internet access from anywhere now...and pretty soon the new rooms here at the hospital will have fast internet access so that will also facilitate the idea.  I have some things to do but I can make it all happen. It will take a few dollars to get things rolling but I have credit cards and I will have some income here soon. Hopefully I will have an anouncment here soon about it all. It is something I think can fly...it will take some time and a lot of work...well a little work each day...but it might help out.  Well I am going to look into some more things and try and get in contact with some people.  I will be calling on ya'll when it all gets started...I promise it won't be anything hard or time consuming. It will require only about ten minutes and no more per day.   Peace

      Ok Happy NEW YEAR! Enough of that joy crap.   My mom just left for the evening. We had a really good talk about journalists and how shitty they have become in general.   Look at all the national journalist leaders. Tom Brokaw, Ted Koppell, and the others that are lower than the "heads" but certainly should be competant journalists. Maybe Charlie Rose is decent and we know that (or at least I think) Bill Moyer is probably one of the few left out there with balls.  However the vast majority of the "journalists" on TV are not even worthless, worthlessness denotes that they lack value and for them...these people on TV they don't lack worth...actually they are very valuable to the cause of mis-information. Their job has now become that of mis-informers and has great value when it comes to keeping the masses out of the loop on what is real.   Many people on the outside and in indy-media have a real problem with the "Joe Millionaire" shows, or the other reality TV shows...I think they suck and shouldn't be on TV but I understand that you have to entertain people from time to time and frankly if the News Departments are doing their jobs then let the people have their schlock TV.  However TV News isn't doing its job...not even nearly. They do even worse than not do their job they mis-inform people.   On mis-information I can pull one thing right from the headlines is the "drop in jobless claims". Personally I find this offensive. Why? Because it is mis-information. Its not a lie so much...because lieing would be unethical but mis-information is ok. They report that unemployement is down to 5.4 or so percent. That isn't correct it is actually closer to 9.4 or so percent.  Read Between the Lines and read where long term claims have actually grown.  What the reports neglect to tell is that many have stopped looking for work and are no longer counted by the system, and some go so far as to say "employers may be thinking happier thoughts as less people are being laid off". Well if they are thinking rosier than I would hope someone would tell that to the people still loosing their decent paying jobs.  In addition Congress and the White House (both Republican Controlled) failed to renew unemployement benefits before they let out for the holidays. So literally millions of people were to loose their benefits around the 21st of December.  One source ...good luck on finding other newer sources of info for it. Now this isn't the first time the Republicans have balked at extending the benefits the let them lapse last year at this time only to renew them around the 15th to 20th of January after initial economic bright spots turned out to not translate into real jobs. It happened in May as well. It is a trend. I am sure that the benefits will be demanded and eventually won, but the point is that in our nation...the best country in the world according to our leaders this kind of thing should never be a problem. Especially when it is known that the economy is truely having problems like it is now and has been for a little over three years now.  So we know they don't really tell us the whole story. Now what about not doing their job.  Well the big guys haven't been asking real questions for a long time of any of our "leaders". I mean right now there is so much to ask yet no one seems to be asking the questions. Why? The common reason that some people would say is that if they asked the questions then they would be not invited back or denied entrance to the press briefings again.   My question or comment back to them is why don't you all drill the person at the front with the same question over and over and over again until you are all banned or they answer the question. Hey...novell idea huh? One reported did it at Centcom during the Iraq war and was pushed out of the briefings by the command...and instead of the reporters and news people sticking up for each other they let it slide like a bunch of spineless wimps. In reality they should have all stuck together and just left the place because they weren't getting real info anyway.   That is what we talked about. I took a bigger picture than what we actually talked about...we talked about a story a little closer to home about why things happened they way they did and why reporters haven't followed in any real way what happened. You would think they would at least make a phone call to someone involved in the case to get a comment...but no.  Anyway...regardless of how or who it applies too...I think that reporters have simply done a shitty job...and it is now being taught in schools and universities. I mean tell me one halfway decent University newspaper that is actually doing its job...or a faculty that will stand up to administration pressures should they come down on a report that may be unfriendly. Now I know all of them will say "oh yeah sure we would" but when has it actually happened in recent times. If it has great...but I bet it hasn't happened all that often. So students aren't really being taught to do what is right and that is fight for the truth.   I worked at a school paper back at my community college...and while I would love to say that if I had ever gotten a really juicy story I would have been backed up...I know that I wouldn't have been in reality. Partly because of the reality of the world. My teachers had families that partly depended on their income from that job. So to choose me over their family is dumb and I would expect them to choose family over me or my story but I would find a way to get it printed. So I understand why but I think it should be different.   So I would hope that people out there would bombard these guys up on the air with questions. Maybe just one question a day. All the same question, one a day.  Thanks for spending some time reading tonight. I want to wish everyone a happy new year and I hope that better things await us come next year. We have had a loosing streak that is about to break one way or the other I can feel it.  Goodnight. May your night be wonderful and safe.

      I noticed that I has spelled something wrong over in my description. The word One...jeesh.  Well I changed the description anyway...cause that is what this blog is becoming...an Indymedia spokespiece...or at least I would like it to be.  I have to learn how to spell...maybe I should get HOP...what's HOP...well that is Hooked On Phonics new brand or branding name...just saw the commercial for the first time early this morning.  Well I signed up for a bunch of newsletters from some more places so I will be getting maybe 10 or 15 newsletters a day...that should give me plenty to write about as I get into them.  I am going to rework my links over there to reflect more catagories...as I now have political really absorbing what would be activism and newsletters catagories when I really only have a couple of truly political links...I may give links to the candidates over there...as I truly believe in being informed so I may give them all links (although many of the sites are Ra-Ra sites like Bush's and Lieberman's as well)...but in fairness I need to give links to all...although I have not made a final decision on that...give me your feedback on that to let me know what you think  nevertheless there will be a shakeup over in that area to make it a little easier to get around in...  Peace  and oh yeah...Happy New Year.

      Blogger is still screwed up I can't get to my own page right now...maybe the rest of the world can. I can obviously post but I can't pull my page up. They had a DNS problem but have it fixed now and should have everything restored soon.  GM was here and brought me my drugs that I needed and the visit went well and at least I wasn't stressed by it all. I like not being stressed....I wish that I could enjoy that all the time.  Well I am off to surf a little more. Something of note...I got all my bills paid freakin' early this month...credit card, phone, and car all paid early...my account is nearly empty (although I have a Christmas Check at the house for 250...) but my monthly check should be credited by the 4th or sooner...plus I have a last paycheck and taxes that are being returned to me...hahaha...so I have a few bucks coming my way.  Oh yeah I also have to get over to the SS office to get that code fixed on my account because I am paying for Medicare when in reality there is a program here in PA to pay the premium for me...I have been paying it for over a year now and since it is going up I think I should get that fixed...once I have that fixed I will get back the premiums that I have paid over the past year...that will be about 650 back to me.  Basically I will be able to be out of debt (with the exception of a car note) in a matter of a month and still have plenty of money (which I could be out of debt this month if I so choose...but I am "rebuilding" my credit by leaving small balances and paying them each month).  I will post again later...after my mom stops or I eat...and perhaps after I visit with Danielle...I need to get down the hall to visit.  Peace

      Well Blogger or Blogspot was acting a little goofy here for a while but now seems to be fixed.  Some interesting stuff over at Common Dreams. It seems that Perle and Frum have written a book on "how to win the war on terror". Oh yeah they have it all figured out. Just about as well as Perle had the war on Iraq figured out.   It calls for some radical stuff like taking out Syria and Iran as well as blockading North Korea and preparing for war against North Korea.  Now even though Powell is not always on the right side of the issues he is still the only one in the cabinet that at least understands things aren't as simple as attacking this and that. He realizes from time to time that you have to different things. He has been the only one who has pretty much stood in the war of an all out war by the Bush administration on the rest of the world. He has again stepped into the breech and is protecting all of us again.  Perle and Frum have written this book and sent it out into the public sphere just as Powell is at his weakest, remember he just had surgery for prostate cancer a few days ago. This is a tactic to force the administration to act.  I have a feeling that this coming year that we are facing is going to be very rough and perhaps we may see some real violence.  If you look around the world (even to our neighbors to the north Canada) no one else is really this frightened and on edge as we are. We have been whipped into a frenzy and many who are misinformed are really scared. So who knows.  Something I wanted to mention last night but just ran out of steam for was this new requirement by the US Homeland Defense thing that air carriers from foreign countries now have to have armed air marshals on any aircraft coming into the states. Now if they don't comply they will not be allowed to enter our airspace.   Ok I kind of understand the rational on this one but I have to again disagree with it all. We are saying to the rest of the world "hey you fuckers can't get airport security right, and since we are the best at it (ha ha) comply with our mandate or fuck off". Well that is my interpretation of what they have said. It is a little crude but it gets the point across.  Some places are already doing this and it will not be hard to do, but some places are barely even able to put fuel in planes so the costs will be prohibitave as well as take some time to come up with air marshall programs (which during that time we would provide our own to help out).   I find this all very offensive because we are again forcing something on the world based on poor information at best and especially seeing that not one of the hijackers started on a plane from overseas....they started from Boston so international air marshall wouldn't have done squat.  Also of issue is that British pilots are objecting because they think it is a bad idea for anyone to be armed in a pressurized tube flying miles above the earth. Bullets and planes don't mix well. They just don't think it is a good idea.  Another thing that I am cheesed off about is that we are saying that we are better than everyone else at security. Oh yeah that works! We are the masters of air security. Shit we couldn't secure a bag of dog shit shot from a catapult. Well maybe not that bad...but close. The Europeans have been doing security better and longer than us and have a pretty decent record as of late. So to tell them what to do should be insulting to them.  Another thing that is being placed out there is new Bio-metrics systems that record pictures and finger prints and compiles data-bases of all these things and allows us to see who can fly and who can't...well a good idea if it applied to everyone (and even then you have to consider privacy issues)...but it only applies to certain countries and it so happens that all of the nations that the hijackers started from (France and other european cities) then they would not have had to go through the system at all. So it wouldn't have even caught them. As it is being implemented it is only meant to record and catalog people of the mid-east. For me it seems that it is the best way of figuring out how to number everyone in the mideast...or at least get a start.  There is so much happening before the new year even gets started. Jeesh...I can feel it will be busy.

      Ok I have a lot of things that I want to tackle tonight so bear with me as while I am in the hospital I have nothing much else to do.  The first thing that I want to discuss and give my opinion on is this new law (well it is a law that has been on the books and been available for use since 1967. It is only for Ohio but I can imagine other states will be watching to see how it works out.   News Story   Well in Ohio some judges are going to start using this. If you didn't read the article it is a special license plate for people convicted of DUI. Now this special tag is different from all the other tags in that it is yellow with red lettering.   Now from a completely common sense view I see that "hey this might be good and might cut down on accidents or DUI's"...but then I get into my civil libertarian mode and I can see that there is a real problem with this rational.  Ok lemme just state a few things. Most DUI drivers probably have done it more than once and really don't see much of a problem with it all. Even when caught these people continue to do it inspite of the law.   Now I can honestly say that I have done it a few times but out of those few times there was only once that I was truly a menace and should not have done it...and looking back I would not have done it. Actually happened recently when I was living in Indiana and my roommates and I were at a house party and I was the only one that was barely standing at the end of the evening. Fortunately we only had to go a few blocks and it was very late at night and I have always been a good driver...so we made it without incident. I will say I will never do that again because when I got back to the apartment I got out of the car and screamed "I was way to drunk for that!!! I will never ever do that again"...then I profusely thanked the gods above because I really should not have done that.  Ok with that little story out of the way I will go back to this law. It gives the judge the power to convict DUI people to have this special license plate. Again not wholely unreasonable...but when you consider that if you are someone with one of those tags on you will attract attention not just from your fellow motorists (which hey it is supposed to warn them that you have DUI's in your past) but it tips off police agencies.  Ok so what it tips off the police? Well think of it this way. Police when they pull you over and want to search your vehicle they have to have probable cause to carry out the search. With this tag not only would the vehicle garner additional attention from law enforcement but also set up automatic probable cause for police to just search your vehicle.   Alarmest am I? Yes on this definitely.  I think that in reality you could make a good constitutional case against this law using privacy rights and 5th ammendment rights. One is privacy and if you have this tag you stick out like a sore thumb and people know your private problems...but the worse violation is against the Fifth Amemdment. Basically it says that you have the right to refuse to incriminate yourself and cannot be compelled to. This tag could be seen (from my eyes) that you have just tossed that sucker out the window. Having the tag on the back automatically prejudices any officer who pulls you over to go through a whole batery of tests (sobriety mainly) and then the officer would want to search your vehicle which because of your tag they have probable cause so you can't stop them.  Here is the perfect storm example of this. John Doe got a DUI conviction and still has his license but has the new plates. John Doe also runs drugs from Cincinnatti to Columbus. You are cruising along and not breaking any apparent laws. You aren't speeding nor driving irratically but you get pulled over regardless because of your tag. Now they run the tests and find nothing but continue to search the car "because you never know"...and even if you were to say "don't search my car" they can say not only from that statement but also because of the tag that they have probable cause to do it. Of course they tear the car apart and find the twenty pounds of pot.  That is the scenaro I see. To me that is a great problem.  Another thing is more dissendence in the Rank and File Israeli armed services.   More troop refuse party lines.   Basically these guys are the uber elite fighters (more secretive than SEALS, Green Berrets, SAS...and likely better trained) of the Israeli Defense Force. The IDF has had some problems as just recently 27 pilots have decided against flying these assasination mission which are illegal under international law. So this uber force has said no we aren't going to continue to kill palestinians and deprive them of basic rights.  This is not only a blow to the extreme right wingers in Israel but also here. America has to come to grips with how we are going to deal with our child over there.   Now it is not anti-semetic to talk critically of Israel's issues as long as you acknowledge their right to a state. While I have different feelings on that (mostly because they are essentially setting up a racist gov. that doesn't want anyone outside of their ethnic background to be a part of...that is a whole 'nother can of worms) I do recognize they are indeed a state and are soveriegn. They have the right to exist is as plainly as I can put it.  However to blindly support Israel is just plane dumb. It is like saying to your kid "its ok you killed you cousin, and we won't mind if it happens again". What has been going on over there has been a systematic attempt from both side to wipe each other off the planet. That is the key...both sides.  You cannot deny that the Palestinians have done some horrible things that are simply barbaric, the same goes for the Israeli's as they have done horrible things to their brothers.  So why do we as Americans blindly support Israel and all its policies when clearly the support for those policies is surely waining in their own nation? I can't give you an answer outside of that we here in the states are afraid to question it for fear of having the Anti-Defimation League crawl all over anyone who talks out of turn. They did it recently to Dean on the mere suggestion that we may want to take a more even handed approach to Israel/Palestine.  Today on my way down to the hospital I stopped to get a pepsi and some three musketeer bars at sheetz in our little burb. Low and behold I saw a H2 there. If I had been in better shape I would have confronted the owner and asked him how he felt about the 400+ lives that have been lost so he can run his vehicle. I also wanted to ask him if he was compensating for a small penis. What is sickening is all the commercials on tv for them lately. I think what is happening is that people are getting in there and looking at them and then they are told of the Tax Credit for those vehicles if they register them under a business. If a person buys a big SUV over a certain weight there is a tax credit that you can get if you register it under your business or phoney business (its not hard to "start" a business). You can actually recieve the total cost of an H2 back in one year as a tax credit...basically the Government pays you to buy the vehicle.  That really pissed me off. I tried to get my camera out so I could get a picture of me flipping the H2 off and the owner as well. I believe this guy lives in Springdale and I may track him down and tell him what I think of his hummer and maybe insult the size of his obviously small dick.  Oh I have more don't you worry...I have a lot to say about the Mad Cow thing and many other issues and I will get to them over the next few days...you just wait. I guess I have been waiting for the right time to get to it all...  Peace...and if you see people driving a H2 get a picture of you flipping them off and lemme know and I will give you a site that you can have it posted on. A site dedicated to the hatred of the H2 and its complete lack of anything remotely needed.

      Ok so I am headed to the hospital in a bit. I am just waiting for clothes to be dry, get a quck shower, then out the door.  I also cleaned up my room a bit. Had a run in with my grandmother in that I just needed for her to open the doors so I could take trash out and she started to say "I'll get it"...well the bags were leaking and I asked her again and she snippily did it with some parting words...then when I came back in and saw the drips out of the bag she was bitching about that...ok if you had just opened the door then there wouldn't be this big mess.  I have learned over the years that I am never right when it comes to how I deal or don't deal with her. No matter what I do or say it will be wrong so I really don't care anymore. I know that even if I do it the way she wants I will still get yelled at. So I have just gotten to the point of just not being around or just ignoring her when she gets moody...because again no matter what I say or do I am wrong..ahh well such is life.  I will update from the hospital. I will have my laptop and phone and my little DVD player...so at least I will have something to keep me busy.

      I just watched "Freedom Downtime" a documentary about Kevin Mitnick. It was a good watch well worth putting food of to watch it.  Get a copy and watch it...definitely interesting and with my own dealings in the Federal Criminal System it gave me something to reference my own experience which was considerably "more friendly".  As I see it now true hackers, those who are in a quest for knowledge not for power, are the true freedom fighters left in this nation. Those that have stood up to Diebold are true patriots.  If I was more skilled (which I guess I could become in a matter of time) I would fight the fight seeing that I really don't care about laws all that much. I see the law as something that has be perverted into something to protect the rich against the poor, not about justice.  I guess what we need now is a true orginazation that would fight for us and help protect us...and I feel the time is coming when it will be a reality because of the many abuses of the government towards our rights.  How cool would it be to gain some sort of control of the vast military systems and deny those in power from using them to fight unjust wars, take away freedoms, and ultimately stop the people in power from endangering us all.  When that day comes there will be great rejoicing.

      Hey I also have thought of something for ya'll to do. Visit FSTV (link on side Free Speech TV) and look for videos. They have many Chomsky video's. Also Google for him and you find a derth of info and many links to speeches and recordings oh Chomsky.  While Al Franken and Michael Moore are great writers that incorporate humor and a tongue in cheek attack against the right. However while Franken's book is well researched...again he is no Chomsky.  Chomsky says many of the same things but in a more mature way which is what is needed considering that the Republicans come of better in interviews because of the way they carry themselves (the only thing that bothers me with them is the trail of slime that accompanies slugs as they move across a surface).  Moore and Franken are very educated (perhaps not formally I really don't know) their information has been carefully pieced together and made to be bulletproof on their facts (where as Anne Coulter and Rush are ill informed on most issues and frankly I would call attention to that and perhaps between their two brains there is maybe the IQ of 120 which shows how low they are in my book...plus Rush has that pill problem).  Chomsky is an academic and is very believable in his message. If any news orginazation were to actually pit Chomsky against either Coulter or Rush he would win hands down because he is just simply smarter than both of them combined. He would be the guy that would look at and say "holy shit...this dude is smart" and it is proven time and time again with his books and intimate knowledge of whats going on as he must read a lot to catch the lies.

      I spent a little time reading Chomsky's book...the more I read the more I see what I already know...not from being spoon fed the info but from me drawing my own independant conclusions. Chomsky certainly has the ideas better polished that I did but I had the basics already.  I suggest for anyone who wants to read something just for information and expanse of knowledge then go get Chomsky's book. It will be a worthy purchase for the 23 bucks it commands.  The next books on my list to get are Jim Hightower's book and Molly Ivan's book.  I am watching Alien Resurection Special Edition on my little DVD player...the screen is very good on it and extremely clear. The only fault that I can find is that maybe the hardware is just barely adequate as sometimes you see jaggies (anti-aliasing) and just a little rough...but really it is certainly acceptable...they got me an Initial 7 inch model that includes a battery pack, home adapter, car adapter, and remote. A great little package.  Well I am going to watch it and then get some sleep. Peace...oh yeah tomorrow I call the doc so I will know what is going on soon. I know I will be headed to the hospital seeing that I can barely walk 20 foot before I get winding and start hacking...so I surely will be headed in.

      I was sitting downstairs and I thought of something disturbing and it will be my little prediction.  Haily Barbour (I think that is the spelling...really I don't care) the former RNC leader was recently elected governor of Mississippi. Really I can't figure out why but here are my predictions for his stint in office.  Mississippi has by far the worst health care in the US...I can vouch for it firsthand. Mainly because social programs such as Medicaid and Child Heath Care have long wanted for more money in the state to provide even basic health care. The system down there is by far very regressive and has needed help.   With the recent budget crisis in almost all states Mississippi was again bound for greatness in its lack of health care.   So the first of my predictions is that we will see the almost entire erosion of all social programs there. While they have never been anything to brag about, MS has provided at least some benefits. I think that we will see bad things in MS that will be a harbinger model for the rest of the nation.  MS was number one in one area and that was tort lawsuits. Almost any lawyer worth his salt knew that if you wanted to sue for big bucks against Corporate America then you held your suit there. MS was the first state to sue bog tobacco and the state won  billions that were to go, oddly enough, towards health care. MS has had a extemely effective Attorney General and he was even featured in a movie called "The Insider" starring Russell Crowe and Al Pachino.  My second prediction is that under Barbour we will see the death of tort...we will see massive tort reform that will allow the rolling back of at least a decade of work on everything from tobacco and chemical plants. The goal for the Republicans has been to severely limit tort lawsuits because their contributors have long suffered crippling settlements. The reform will be the model for the rest of the nation and as a result we will see sweeping changes that will allow corporations to effectively be imune to lawsuits that might have an impact that would result in positive change to business as usual.  No one until this point has really seemed to grasp this...or at least that I have heard about. So if we see people and media picking up on the idea remember that you read it hear first.  So there you have it. My predictions.  On the health front I am pretty sick...today I spent a lot of time asleep...and really that felt good but it didn't help.  Today I went to a record store here in town and found a unique gem. This store has just about everything you could want or dream for. On the second floor they have around 35,000 used CD's and what I would guess would be around that number in vinyl. They also have an extensive collection of used video tapes. On the first floor is the new selections but the majority is not the popular schlock you would find at any record store (they have it too), but you will find many groups from the outside. DVD's are also on the first floor.  I got four CDs and two DVDs for 51 dollars. Can't beat it.  Well goodnight folks. Peace.

      Walter Cronkite is on Wolf Blitzer right now and he really does a good job for an old coot.  Asked if the media has done a good job of covering the war he replied we have done satisfactory job after it started but we missed the lead up and didn't cover the debate in the Senate for giving the blanked authority to the president to wage war against Iraq.   He basically said they failed the people and they should be doing more now to make up for that.  Right on Walter...there is a reason that he has been voted the most trusted man out there...because he has been straight shooting since 1950 and was the first to say the war in Vietnam was a stalemate. Which he called correctly long before anyone realized it.  When asked if Iraq reminded him of Vietnam he said it does and it is striking the similarities of how the wars were underestimated and poorly prepared for.  I would be honored to meet that man. He is the last of his kind and today pound for pound is the best reporter or journalist in the world even well after he has retired.  Again it would be an honor to meet and talk to him because he is a national treasure and we should be recording as much of the man as we can...we will never be able to replace him.

      Harken plans to endorse Dean...the official statement should be forthcoming.   Another endorsement, another hit by the media...CNN is now riding even harder saying he can't be elected.  Dean is to be on Inside Politics in about an hour so we will see what happens.  Don't doubt Dean...

      Last night I tried to make a post about someone whom I have great respect for and that was Noam Chomsky.  There are many video and audio clips of his speeches over at  Freespeech.org .  I would highly suggest that you head over and take advantage of the stuff they have up. A good primer for listening and getting into his style would have to be this video  "Chomsky: The World After Iraq Invasion (Realmedia Video)" .  This is a newer speech of his and very telling. It really is a culmination of many years of work and he is optimistic in this particular speech saying that there are things we can do to correct the coarse of action...in many of his other speeches he tends to shy away from making suggestions on what to do and generally lets the listener, viewer, or reader decide what course to take...but this speech he did give a few more suggestions of actions to take so it seems that he has finally gotten to his critical mass point and now feels compelled to really say something outside of just outlining the problems.  Again it is a great primer for the current Chomsky...be warned as he says he is not a charasmatic speaker...you think Gore is a bore...than this guy may lull you into sleep if you don't listen to what he is saying...but if you do listen and actively process the message it really causes great amounts of thoughts to start bouncing around in your bean.   Health Update Extra! Extra!  Well if you have been reading even semi regularly you have seen far more daily posts than in the past...particularly over the past week or so. The last few days the post have come even more frequently and they tend to be a little longer.  Well if you have noticed that then know that it is still because I am stuck in the hospital and this has become my "lifeline" to the outside world. People want to know what state of aggitation I am in...just read. The angrier the posts the worse I fell....just a little guide to the levels.  Yesterday was a really really shitty day. My kindey functions started going up the day before so they took me off of Tobramycin thinking that may be the cause of high kindey readings and dropped my dose of Collistan because that may have also been the culprit. Well to deal with that they just generally flush you with a lot of saline and liquid and usually your body gets straight...  Over about a 24 hour period they pumped about 3 liters into me, normally when you get that fluid it is because you are leaking somewhere along the line and you need the fluids to raise blood pressures and boost fluid amount to you can have a pressure. Well I am not really leaking from any spot so most of the liquid retained and started to bloat me...I'm not talking about you know womans time of month bloat...I am talking probably 20 pounds of liquid in 24 hours. Normally kideys and liver and bladder step up getting out the fluid (plus I have had the runs...eww gross I know) but I haven't expelled nearly enough fluids to keep balance...so now I sit here with probably 20 or so pounds of fluid on me...thirsty life a bugger, I am bloated and having a harder time of breathing because of the fluid.  I imagine that this is what kidney failure patients feel like often (I know my grandpa feels much worse than this daily and has because he has been in full blown kidney failure for a while now...when he gets dialisys they regularly remove 15-25 pounds of toxins and water from his system).  Now I sit here and I am really thirsty but taking in the fluid is hard because it has nowhere to go...and I haven't peed nearly enough to evacuate the fluid....so something is up doc and it isn't pleasant.  Surprisingly I am ok with it all because there is now way that any doctor could have caught this earlier and Dr. Weinberg came in and apologized for this snafu and that while he was off this weekend he would make sure to check up on me through Dr. Yee (one of his talented associates).   The biggest problems that are presenting themselves right now is that I am breathing much harder and more shallowly than normal (result of liquid) and while last night before bed my pulse oxygen level was 97-98% on room air and a heart rate of around 100bpm my sats dropped in maybe five hours of rest to 90-91%, heart rate of 120-130, and ever more shalow laboured breath. So somthing is up.   If I were really sick and kind of out of it than I wouldn't feel so bad I guess or at least not care that I feel so bad...but I am not that ill...I am just so uncomfortable almost like the plum girl in Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory once she started blowing up. I am still getting bigger and the fluids are just coming off....it is really shitty. Plus with all this liquid I have a hard time standing up and getting moving because my joints are packed with fluid...you can see it because you can "jiggle it, just a lil bit, woah!"  So I am just not feeling well and it sucks balls.  Well it is time for my morning beating...hopefully they can knock loose some of the shit.  Peace  Oh joy now I have a nosebleed...christ on a cross....

      I posted at some vanity blog today...something I rarely do because I find it a waste of time trying to educate people that have no desire to learn anything of importance...but it was on the matter of the MTv Show "Rich Girls". I feel bad for them because of their basic lack of knowledge on anything. They don't look happy, they look like they are stuck...they look like cannon fodder.  I tried to give a few words...I am sure it will sail far above their collective IQ of 90 over there...but one thing I have learned in the years...just because someone is stupid doesn't mean that they can't learn or become informed.  So I dropped a little nugget off and challenged them to come in for some education h0n3z style...straight laced and eager to let you come to your own conclusion.  Learning can be fun if you make it fun. Thinking is fun when you let it be. Intelligence is the gift of the ages that seperates us from most other species...that gift is whimsical thought and desire.   Rich Girls Fluff blog...normally I wouldn't but I felt compelled to leave them with something.   Peace...and I still have more reading and possibly posting to do yet...but first off to get a sandwich from the cafeteria...I am slightly hungry...oh and have I got a shitty day to tell ya'll bout....  Blah!

      I am watching Colin Powell's press thing today.  I must say that the journalists that are there seem to have a little more teeth with him than they have shown with Scott McLellan, Rumsfeld, and other political idoits in the Administration.  Why is that...perhaps because Powell actually attempts to answer questions...sure there is doublespeak and dancing as anybody who looks to be in some sort of conflict with the leaders over basic policy stances as I think Powell has with the hawkish nature. Powell is a hawk to be sure, but he is a more cautious hawk than the rest. I think it is because he has been shot at he realizes that even the highest flying hawk can be shot out of the sky with the right mix of powder and bullets.  One question that was really good and I just had to laugh at his responce was when a reporter asked him how he felt about the just released Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report on how he has been perhaps to hawkish about foriegn policy and how they trumped up the weapons claimed to have been held by Iraq. She then said how Perle and Flum have in their latest book called him soft on policy and that he is the weak link in the administration over how to deal with terrorists. Powell just got this look on his face and said "I don't do book reviews."  He then took the next question but quickly put that answer on hold and said "seriously I don't do book reviews. If I am soft on these things there is only one person that I have to answer to over there and the president doesn't seem to bothered by my actions." That is to the best of my recolection. Not the exact words but a very close paraphrase.  All I could do was laugh because he at once showed that he was indeed the better man, as well as in my view bellitled them because in part they have never been in the military and have no clue as to how to handle things correctly. That is what I read out of it...the only thing that would have made it better for me is if he would have chuckled and said that they were as worthless as tits on a boar. That would have been perfect...unfortunately he still has to have a little tact.  Now I am not a huge fan anymore of Powell because I believe that he could have stopped or at least spoken out more loudly pointing out the shortcomings of the administrations case for war. I understand why he didn't...frankly if he would have he would have had his pretty good name and record absolutely smeared by these people who have no real integrity. Sometimes it takes you sitting in an uncomfortable position for long periods of time before something good will come from it. Powell looks like he has been sitting waiting for the right moment and I believe that the moment is close at hand...especially with this whole CIA leak thing in the White House...I think that may be what Powell is waiting for to really let loose and call these people on their statements and lies.  I hope that is what he is doing. Because I feel deeply that Powell is essentially a good man at heart and in the end he will be vindicated...but he could only do it through taking all this shit first.  I just hope in the coming months he proves to be the man that I think he is...even with his flaws without him having been there to really stand in the breech I feel that we would actually be a lot worse for wear without him and what has seemed to be his very good sense of limits and balance that he has ever so expertly infuenced policy just enough from making this a blowout against us.  Just my views...

      Ok I have decided that I need to stop reading at around midnight because if I don't I get all fired up and have a hard time getting to sleep because of all the stuff that bounces around in my head.  So many things I read last night had me nearly up on my bed jumping around screaming yelling "yeah you go you go...damn more people need to read that, or the ever dreaded hip grind into the face of the right"...it was almost if I had that false profit Pat Robertson in here so that I could dress him down with the most intelligent and hard hitting bible study that I could muster and all he would be able to do is fall to his knees and pray for forgiveness for his sins.  You see I am not a religious person. I believe in something but it certainly falls outside of what would considered main stream religion. I believe in a higher power but I refuse to name it/he/she/they because I simply do not know what or who it is that is our higher power. I also give my higher power the ability to be autonomous and really be like any good benevolant leader should be, objective and willing to stay out of the fray considering that when he seemed to meddle in the past affairs of this planet and its people it has always been at great detrement and large loss of life. I give this power the credit to think that it is capable of not only great passion for its children but also even greater wisdom to truly learn from the mistakes it has obviously made in the past.  All of the current religions tend to dumb down their god. Make it some inflexable being that is not capable of rational thought or coherant ideas. I find that heresy considering that all of the religious texts seem to back up my theory of this really truly great being or beings.  Now I fully admit that I don't know what we are dealing with because I have not met or directly spoken to this being. I cannot possibly fathom what it wants out of us whether it be good little subserviant doobies or instead real thinking animals that test and probe the limits of our understanding left and right.   There just isn't simply any text that I know of that gives us direction, instead all the religious zealots have been able to say (whether Islamic, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, all the religions) is have faith and trust us when we say jump, you jump. For me I find that insulting that my higher power doesn't have the trust in me to possibly come to some conclusion on what or how that power is...and if it just wanted us to believe whole heartedly in the descriptions given by the religious leaders of the world than it would have been hard wired into our heads long ago and we would never have debate on religion...it would just be right and we would all be doing it. However that power thats up there (as I am sure something is) instead gave us minds that are powerful enough to not only master tool building, metal working, and advanced science reasoning but the ability for truly creative thought. So that would lead me to believe that in its infinite wisdom they gave us the ultimate power to shape and form outcomes.  I also believe that at some points it/they/he/she did intervene albiet with not a mighty calvary of winged beasties but instead through men that have dotted our history that if you look a little outside the "written gospels" on them you will see that they really were different thinking from all the "religious heads" of the day and truly sought to teach things that other considered heresy. Many of these men and women met with rather nasty endings after they challenged one to many of the rules that the "men of god" laid down.   Breaking News From Iraq  A Blackhawk Helicopter went down early today and now nine have been confirmed by CNN. This in addition to the one fallen soldier from the Mortar Attack on a logistics base outside of Bahgdad. Around 34 soldiers were injured in that attack.  This is horrible that we have lost more soldiers. This also unfortunately prooves Dean's possition that our forces are indeed no safer even with Saddam Hussein captured and on ice.   As a person that wants to see our current administration removed from power I would much rather they be removed without having to have the daily bloodshed of people that I can identify with because many of them are of a similar age to myself and many of them really do believe in why they are there (even though I think they are mislead on it all... but I am of the firm belief that many more are coming to the conclusion that they have been indeed used for corporate profit taking considering that they are short of supplies, they know their institution is paying way more than market value for fuel, and many of them plod around in Flak Vests that offer not much more than minimal margin of safet if not making them less safe with the reduced mobiliity and the very design of the material to stop more blunt trama and not necesarily designed to stop bullets). If truth were to be told and I was healthy I would join the military...not because I want to kill me some people, but because I believe that the military needs thinking people not killer robots. I would protest openly in the military against this invasion and now occupation, but it would not stop me from doing my duty to my nation. The thing is you can be honorable and disagree with the policy but still have the moral high ground by truly defending your nation by treating the people that we are occupying fairly and humanely. Being nice to people is far better than kicking them around and belittling them, taking away the basict dignity that seems to be lacking in many areas.  So we need to make it a point to hire "softer" troops that are a little more tolerant of others. We don't need pansies in the military but we certainly need an injection of humanity.  So my heart goes out to the fallen men of the military on this day...I would love to hear from men and women in the military and know their opinion for myself. I hope we can get an administration in place this year that actually cares for you and if it is decided that you all have to stay then the least that we can do is make sure you are well equiped and protected as much as possible so that your chances of coming home are heightened and the exposure to danger relieved as soon as possible.  Good luck and godspeed to you all. Remember that even though many of us do not agree with you being there you can rest asured that you will not come home as a national disgrace. The disgrace belongs solely to those in power and they will be the ones to face the heat...not you.  Take pride in our troops.

      What I have decidedly avoided saying not because I fear the flak but because I lacked the ability to even apply simple rational thought without irrationally knee jerking to the conclusion that I needed to go around and just slap some sense into everybody that I could get my hands on.  I am not a genious...I am of rather normal intelligence, maybe slightly smarter than your average bear in search of a picnic basket...but I do take pride in the fact that I spend part of my day just thinking...taking a break from mind dulling activities such as watching TV or movies (even though I spend considerable time in front of the boob toob and the wholely addictive internet)...I just sit and ponder while I doodle or stare at the wall of ceiling.  This plucky Seatle native (they do tend to be snobs and that has been the largest reason people tend to recoil from the liberal ideal...because liberals do sometimes or almost always when they come from the northwest come off as snobs...and your average Chris B in MS just takes offense at snobs even though he believes that everyone should have health care and that people should have food)...so I am glad someone has said it...I just wish it weren't so true that it was ugly.

      Stop the presses...stop em quick. The little firebrand Arianna Huffington has spoken...ok so its no big deal...we all just like her accent (well at least I do).   Arianna Huffington telling the establishment Democrats the frightening truth.   Wow...another person that some know of has gotten behind Dean...and for all the right reasons and put it clearly in their intent of support without resorting to lighthearted "hehehe he's great" rhetoric...instead choosing to make the point through direct language and straight thought.

      All this hoopla over labor?  Got off the phone with mom about it all and she was a little blown away at how I wrote about it. In the middle of talking to her the respiritory dude came in and was larguing with me on what the labor department has done and that it would never happen and they have been trying to do that for years.  My response was "well of coarse employers have been trying to do it for years, but until now there hasn't been an administration of body of pro-corporate interests that have actually filled enough of the government to actually change policy and effect real world change...so up till now it has been rhetoric, and for all we know people will get wise to it and stop it dead, but based on how mislead and how cowed people really are then the changes will go through and be implemented quietly and with little cause for alarm over a five or ten year term. People won't see the change because it will be so slow and with us being so used to fast change when something like that grows slowly we largely ignore it and accept the new reality because it didn't come all at once and there was no "a-ha" moment to it all."   The ice age didn't end overnight most likely, but as the ice packs retreated life flourished in places that it couldn't before and most certainly the life that pervaded into what was once hostile land had no collective memory of how bad it was but a few years or decades earlier. The same goes with advanced life forms...the evolve and adapt just as the simpler forms of life do making small incremental changes over time to accomodate new realities (as long as they are largely non-toxic to life as a whole)...so in that is what these new labor policies rely upon...the inability of the human animal being able to track small changes or changes in norms over long periods of time. Time has proven this to be the way things go.   A natural example would be of the oil crisis in the 70's. Fuel costs sored at once and people cried foul...as the crisis let up the costs went down but not down to their previous lows if weighted against inflation (a normal thing in a capitalist system) and slowly over time they have creeped back up to what if properly weighted against the current dollar would likely prove to be the same per-gallon average as seen during the oil crisis...but because it incrementally went from 50 to 60 cents then maybe a bump to 80 cents a gallon then a slight easing...now we are all pretty used to paying 1.40-1.80 for fuel...but if the price had jumped up there in the early nineties and remained people would have demanded some sort of explanation...but the prices didn't go up dramatically (until this last Iraq war and prices are still high from it all). It is just in our human nature and our biologic inability to track very fine movements over any period of time. It was not the way we were bread.  So here is a link to the new policy that is currently working its way into law that got me all fired up at the dude (I feel almost bad because I went right on the attack and flat out told him he was wrong...and he may not be the brightest bulb on the tree as having seen with dealings with him in the past)...I came off strong and aggressive and he was like "woah! your a radical"...my flat responce was this (and it is because I still am) I am a registered rupublican and I have mainly voted republican in the past, but I no longer take the even moderate republican view now because it has shifted way past center into whacky right field with no eminant return to sanity to be seen for as long as the eye can cast its gaze. Which yes I am still a registered republican (I try to think of myself as a liberal McCain supporter...may not agree with him on all things but I find myself agreeing with him more often than not because of his seemingly no BS aproach to it all)...   Commondreams.org writeup on new proposed laws and enforcement for the labor department.   Fact Sheet #23: Overtime Pay Requirements of the FLSA.   Minimum Wage from the horses mouth.   That site is hard to get through but it has all of the pertinant information on new proposals....if someone stumbles across the link before I do with the new recomendations then please send it my way and I will get it up...and you will get the credit for finding it. Hell I'll send you a dollar if you find it.  This is important stuff people...very important indeed seeing that it will happen but it will happen at glacial speeds so that no one notices or protests before the change has already happened.  Peace

      Ok so I didn't tackle the whole slavery thing I thought I would...but I will add it as an afterthought...under the system that Shrub has proposed would basically allow US businesses to take advantage of this cheap labor for up to three years then cast them back no better than they were...to me that kind of equates to slavery because the worker benefits minimumly while the business reaps maximum reward from the sweat of their brow.  So ok it isn't the best argument that it will bring back slavery...but hey its all I could come up with this fast...so I am not the best truthsayer...but I do sometimes get it right ;-)

      Well today Shrub anounced his new sweeping illegal alien program. Unfortunately it won't catch any of those pesky et's but it will manage to create an underclass here in the US one that can only be matched by our past in a system much like slavery.  Ok now hold on folks...that's a lot of rhetoric there and I promise I will try and back up what I say...while the numbers on this subject are hard to get a hold of because really there is no central position on it...you are either anti-imigrant or pro-imigrant and that really leaves the vast majority of us out of the debate forcing us to one side or the other when really I believe if people looked at it as I do then you would see a pretty sensible approach to all of this.  First I actually have to commend Shrub on this because the last president to take this hot button issue on headlong was Reagan...and he got it wrong just as Shrub is getting it wrong again...but it does take some moxy to step up to the plate and for that he gets maybe a half a golf clap out of me.  Here is what I think people overlook a lot in this debate. Currently illegal aliens are filling positions that US citizens would not and will not work for the money that is being offered to do those jobs. Notice the inclusion of money in that sentence...because money is rarely used in its proper context in this debate. People who say "illegals take away good jobs from Americans" actually they aren't taking good jobs, often these jobs are cooks, dish washers, yard boys, field workers....and the catch is that they are being paid less than minimum wage in many cases. So yes in a sense they are taking jobs, but these aren't the jobs that Americans would work for the wages offered so businesses do what businesses do and hire the next best thing, a warm body and don't even bother to think "maybe if we raised the pay we could find an American citizen to work the job"...but we also have to face the fact that most Americans are snobs and would turn down 7 or 8 dollars an hour to flip burgers while a foreign worker would be perfectly happy to make 3 dollars an hour to do the same job...they see a more to work than perhaps pay.  So what do I suggest we do about the "massive illegal alien workers" situation.  Well I suggest we give out all the worker visas we can possibly print. Hand them over with no regard to where or who the people getting them are (I don't mean just hand them out willy nilly but nonetheless hand many many out). Then in addition to handing them out we extend the labour laws to cover these workers and indeed tax them on their earnings and tax their employers just like a California business is taxed on a legal citizen and in the process raise the minimum wage or move towards a living wage system.  Now while that may not attract more US workers into these less than best jobs we can at least guarantee that if we are to employ foriegners it won't be at the expense of lower paid immigrant workers. Also if we document these people and tax them then we are adding revenue streams to our own system that essentially nullifies any fears of us loosing money in social programs to help out the sick that will surely happen amongst them. Most of these workers come over here now (illegally) and work for months or years rarely actually hitting the health system (mainly because they fear if they do go into the health system they will be deported...which is almost always the case under our current system)...so when they do hit the system it is usually because they are very sick...and we all know that preventative medicine is always cheaper but the current system makes that impossible.  So we are generating taxes off of these people that essentially zero's their impact on our social services plus we fill jobs that Americans classically won't work.   Now the big catch is that we have to force businesses to pay these higher wages and if they don't then they need to be fined or shut down if they do not comply with fair labor practices. That is the hard sell because right now they have no real incentive to pay these workers more because they can always find more (usually for less as time goes on) and the fines that they may incur for employing these illegals really ads up to less than a slap on the wrist and certainly not even close to what it would actually cost to hire a legal alien or American to do the job...so the cost benefit ratio (big business term there) is actually in favor of hiring illegals and occasionally having to pay fines for employing them because the fines will most assuredly be less than the cost to employ a legal or American citizen. It is as simple as that.  You change that to where it is vastly more costly to employ illegals at these low wages and make it truly a hassle then you will see real wages rise for these immigrants (who in the end only want the same thing as us and that is happiness and prosperity and enough to feed their families) as well as we may see an incentive for American citizens to go back to what they think are the low class jobs. They can't be low class if the guy next to you (who is foreign) is making the same money that you are...you are the same in the eyes of the IRS so that is fair.  Now how do you deal with the inevitable beauracracy that this will add. Well first we make these work permits just that...work permits they are not an entitlement to SS (and as such would be exempted from SS taxes, but not federal wage and state wage taxes...and you would still pay maybe an insurance tax for medicaid as many of these immigrants would probably need state insurance because as many of us already know private insurance does not work at all...it has failed). These temporary permits would allow the free travel of the holder of the permit and his/her immediate family (spouse and children only not extended relatives). These relative would be allowed to stay in country for maybe 4-6 months out of the year and must return to their native country for the rest of the time. The actual  documented worker must be here for 8 months minimum and at a maximum of three years (similar to Shrubs proposal)...after that time is up they would be allowed to re-apply just like getting a drivers license and if the person has been a good doobie (not broken any major laws...we can let em slide on drinking and minor offenses but not major felonies just as a play to keep law and order intact) we let them automatically renew. That process can go on forever and it will benefit us...we will have the labor but we won't carry the SS burden unless they choose to go through the process and are selected for citizenship then at that time they are a citizen and they pay their fair share.  This is a sensible idea...the idea of deporting all these illegals does us a double diservice...first it means that we have to spend billions upon billions on border defense and as we have seen for all these years and all the money we have spent we have not made a dent in even making illegal immigration slow, and we also deprive ourselves of willing laborers (in the process we may inspire a few workers of our own to realize that flipping burgers is just that...its not a life statement...Emeril essentially flips burgers but no one thinks of him as some wetback...because he takes pride in his work).  Also to consider is that borders are arbitrary lines drawn on a map and have never actually once represented what or how a particular population may actually use or travel land in a natural way. Politicians draw lines and then expect indigenous people to adhere to those lines when just a few years before they could travel openly with maybe paying a small tribute to a local chieftan or through exchange of labor or ideals amongst people.  So instead of knee jerking it like the Republicans do and saying "ship em all out" or instead of sugar coating it like the Dems do...we need to make it an honest debate. The Republicans make money through the tough anti-immigration laws...all of the law enforcement supply agencies are overwhelmingly Republican backers...it makes sense that the Republicans would want to promote anti-immigrant policies so they could keep their corporate sponsors happy. The Dems aren't much better because they never come straight with the truth...they sugar coat it.  Here is a first for me...and you may see more of it from me in the future...finally Labor has got the right track on this one. Finally they have gotten their collective heads out of their asses and realize that regardless of whether or not a laborer is in a union that the union still has a responsibility to the workers and should fight for all workers...because if all workers are promoted and paid fairly then the entire tide rises instead of splitting people up, forcing people into anti-union zealots because of past union misdeeds. Fight for them all win them all...fight for the few you will surely die on the vine.  So here's from me to the Labor Unions...while I may have disagreed with many of your practices (mainly because of lack of flexability with employers to work towards equitable solutions...but lately we know that businesses are making much more now than before so I have reversed my previous opinions and now mostly support Unions as long as they continue to keep their heads) I now know that you have landed on the right side of the fence and I am glad to finally be proud to say that while I may not always agree with you if I ever do come to a place that is a union shop I will join and if there is a great inequity in business practices and management practices towards workers than I will be the first on the bus to help unionize.  So you see people can change...I have over the past few year (as once I was staunchly anti-union because of their past practices) because now I am Pro-Union even with the problems...at least they are there banging the drums and fighting for worker rights.  The same must be done for workers around the world and the current illegals as our unions attempt to do for our own. We all work together and we all rise...if we neglect certain peoples than it only hurts the many...and weakens us all.  Peace...and open your minds.  I wonder what Mr. Chomsky would think of this line of thought? Hmmmm....

      Well last night I read a little more and today I spoke with one person already about our current situation and like me he was really alarmed...not scared about terrorism mind you, scared of what is being made of it all and how many freedoms he has seen lost like when he drove his brother to Pittsburgh Airport and his SUV was searched, not with probably cause or because of any real scare, but because the Department of Homeland Defense or Security is just hell bent on violating as many of our civil rights as possible.  So for me if I have to go out to the airport and pick people up I will refuse the search...hell let them ticket me or detain me but they do not have the authority to unlawfully search my car. It is one of my rights to unlawful search and seizure and if they have a problem with it then we can take it to court...I think that all Americans should start this move towards that ideal period.  Face it folks on one hand we play down how "dumb" the terrorists are that they would even try to smuggle a car bomb nice and close to an airport recieving area (not the terminal itself moind you, but ticket counters and baggage claim areas). Thinking that they would be dumb enough to try it is really stupid, they know the security is tighter and while they may attempt to probe they would not seriously attempt an attack like that. On the other hand we give common thugs (the Taliban and Al-Queda could be classified as nothing more than street thugs not all that much unlike the early years of the Itallian Mafia) this elevated sense of power over us by saying that they are so bright that they are outsmarting us left and right. Now they are either really bright or really dumb folks, can't be both ways. However by making them out to be a real true threat we give them far more credit than they deserve and more attention than is due for them.  If we treat them like criminals and move this "war on terrorism" back to a police and intelligence/investigative mode we would certainly see far more progress than sending our troops in to occupy nations that don't want us, and we could save ourselves billions of dollars and maybe perhaps return some of the freedoms that we have so willingly given up in the name of fighting terror.  If we don't do this then they have won. They will have with one bold, yet trajic event will have changed our system and our nation for the worse and they have won if they get that much out of us.  Freedom isn't free, freedom lives through the shed blood of our country men/women and to ask me or any other true patriot to give up rights just because we did loose people is wholely Un-American. We lay our lives at the alter of freedom and from time to time we loose people to the alter of freedom, but through those trajedies, through those losses we should always choose to come out stronger in our will and desire to respectfully defend our freedom...and by respectfully I mean leave the system alone and tweak it to help in defense but never at the expense of liberty.  Fight the police and Homeland Security Defensive military, don't allow them to search you. If you have nothing to hide they have no grounds to search you. It is one of your most basic rights guaranteed under our Civil Rights declaration.

      There were some good reads on  CommonDreams.org . Some stuff that is much needed right now to help liberals who may feel a little blue at what is going on out there especially seeing that the Republicans have seemingly got the better of us on the whole Bush/Hitler gaffe which I hold was a plant to do exactly that...give the right some cheap ammunition to fire off randomly hoping to hit and wound a few foes...for some it has worked I am sure because people are geniunely not that well informed on the behind the scenes actions that the RNC regularly takes to discredit others while propping itself up on the very thing they use to tear down their competitors (like horrible advertising campaigns like that of the Max Cleland campaign in GA where they morphed him into Osama...even though the man had lost three limbs in Vietnam.)  Another place to head to is  Truthout.org . Head there for some hard hitting straight shooting towards the Republicans...while they say they are able to attack both sides they really are much better at getting under the skin of the Republicans (because after all they are morally bankrupt and slimey creatures through years of inbreeding). They have a great op-ed on Bush/Hitler that brings the brutal truth and in another op-ed singlehandedly gave me hope that those of us who are true moderates have a lot to look forward to because of exactly what GW Shrub has pledged and delivered on. He brought unity...most definitely...but to the left, a unity that has not ever been seen before on the left side of the fence. The entire left while still having very different opinions on what should be done all have one common goal and that is to get GW out of office.  So there is hope and I believe we will all be free of the evil that has embraced our nation even though the big thing will be for corporations to try and stop it...they still can't stop a true vote...and if we make it fair and demand accountability then guess what...we will win.  Chins up...and keep the faith.

      There are new polls out showing that Dean trails Bush by about 15-20 points and say that this will be a blowout for the President.  I would like to offer up an opinion on this. Dean is currently running against 10 candidates. All the Democrats and Bush himself. So he has a lot of different points that he has to cover. Really I am sure Dean is a little tired because he really is having to fight away in what has become one of the worst primaries ever with all these guys not talking about issues instead trying to sling mud and only have made a Democratic President more difficult to get to.  I figure once it is a head to head fight with true national exposure we will see the numbers indeed tighten up.  I like how Dean has said that we have to move campaigns away from God, Guns, and Gays and instead should be dealing with issues like education, health care, social responsibilities, and other things that are way more important. Unfortunately the Democrats have been weak in the three G's as far as most people say. In reality I believe that democrats are pretty even on those issues with Republicans but the Republicans have been more willing to wear they're faith on their sleave like a swastika. Unfortunately people have consistantly fallen for that argument and as a result have in reality been lead away from some of the most basic tennants of Christianity. Free Market economics and capitalism don't actually jive with Christian tennants but unfortunately few christians realize that.  So...  We will have to wait for them to go head to head for real issues to surface.  My mom just left and I wish that I could record the things I say and the conversations I get into because I have all of this pent up frustration about things.  My main thrust of thinking right now is the whole system that we live in and work with is downright wrong. We have people that want to farm and enjoy that throughout the world but they are not aloud to farm, we have people that are healers yet they are not offered the opportunity to do that. We have more than enough talented people to do all of the things that need to be done to live in a comfortable world for all and not have even a need for an economic system or currency outside of basic work and labor.   I often think to how nice it would be if we all did what we had talent for. Some would be computer geniouses, some artists, some doctors, ditch diggers, and lawn mowers...but there are plenty of people that are happy with even something so simple yet they are pushed into working long hard hours for money which is really just a few cents worth of material. We have people that are miserable because they don't have enough to buy their kids food, or have access to even basic health care or clean water.  The whole system that we are working under and that is being pushed by those in power is not even remotely natural. Humans (pre-historic ones and even middle aged humans) lived in a co-operative structure that allowed people to contribute what they could and everyone had food, water, shelter, and they lived what we would consider simple but happy lives. The system that we toil under now doesn't even remotely take into consideration that health, happiness, and prosperity don't exactly revolve around the dollar, yet day in and day out it is beaten into our heads that we have to have more money to be happy, and more stuff to be truly prosperous.  Now mind you I love toys and things. I love my car, and there are cars that if I could afford them I would buy...I love to have gizmos and such and if I could afford more I would certainly love to have them, but it does not mean that I am incomplete without them.  I wish that we could live in a world that we would truly seek happiness not through material wealth but instead find it enough to be in the company of nice people, or at our jobs doing whatever they might be but really enjoying them.  We could still have a reasonable version of what we have today. We would still have cars and planes and skilled people to do particular tasks, but instead of forcing people into positions that aren't where they may be best suited we move more towards the natural things that bring us happiness. There are people out there that love to work on cars, fix planes, dig ditches...they may not really enjoy it now because they are having to base their lives off of it, but if they didn't have to worry about making x number of dollars a month just to keep a roof over their head we would see a outpouring of kindness and happiness that would truly make the system we are toiling under look absolutely barbaric.  It won't happen overnight and may never happen at all, but I just wonder where it went. When we were children we did things that were fun and during those early years you can see the primitive nature come back out in us all as we do things for joy (some of us who grew up on farms made it a game of picking beans, those of us in more urban dwellings maybe put our play time towards computers, yet we enjoyed what we were doing). At what point do we as a society start to reprogram that most basic of all instincts, the instinct to be happy or content. That would be interesting to study.  Maybe many people have it wrong and those adults who act childish may have it more correct then us serious adults. Those adults live for fun (although in todays day and age probably at the expense of others around them) but they have a more organic view of life that includes playtime.  I know some will probably think "what is this kid smoking" well right now it is recombined hamster ovaries in my Alpha-Dornase (Pulmozyne a DNA med for CF patients)...but I think that we may need to think about some of these things.  I wish sometimes that I could tame the beast in my head because it really does run at what feels like a million miles a second and it can be at times quite tiring. I can say that in the past my attempts to numb that were fruitless because once I became un-numb things just moved faster and more fluidly and I had a harder time keeping up because of essentially the backlog.  I just feel that perhaps a whole series of thought has been seriously overlooked here in our nation and perhaps most of the first world over. I won't say that I would leave and live in a jungle, because I love modern things like air-conditioning, computers, the internet, and DVDs...but I think that in first world people's have gotten caught up in it all and have ignored for the most part what may be the most rewarding thing on the earth and that is simple time to think, time to contemplate, time to just spend around friends and family. Instead we pack as much diversion into a day as we can jst so we can avoid those most basic things.  I am not saying that some farmer Zapatista in rural Mexico spends his whole day working his land and thinking about astrophysics...but in a way he may be more able to come to more unique conclusions than the guy who has to drag himself day after day to his lab just so he make his payment on his chevy and house.   If this makes any sense to anyone please let me know...because having been the way I have been in the last few months (fairly sick) I have been re-aligning my thoughts and many new things that I though would never come to me have. I now espouse ideals that not all that long ago I would have looked down on, but now I after having spent a little time thinking about some of those things they make sense now.  I would just wish that people not get sick and have to think about this stuff under these circumstances but it would be nice for people to take maybe 20 minutes a day and think outside the box, read something that they make think is whacko, and concentrate on not thinking about the status quo. If we could all make that little concession I bet the world would be a better place twenty minutes at a time.  Well to all my fellow thinkers out there...I am glad if you have read this far and I hope that perhaps you too will come to think a little like I do (I don't want you to be little parrots marching around repeating the chant....instead I want only to inspire you to put some time into thinking and not having something spoon fed to you). I would love to be adored for my views and seen as the missionary of hope...but that is pride. Instead all I ask is that you take that twenty minutes a day a do something you might not do with it...go look at clover, watch the sky (you'd be surprised how quickly you can loose track of time and thought when you watch a blue sky...often coming to some rather organic and natural thoughts that if you hadn't watched the sky you would never have thought the thoughts). It is just about centering yourself a little each day...and as you do that I am fairly certain more people would see the insanity in it all maybe strive for better things.  I wonder what Noam thinks of that?

      I got my some of my newsletters today and some of them are pretty alarming.  The first comes from bushgreenwatch.org and it has to do with changes on how sewage treatment plants would be allowed to dump raw sewage if they have just minor overages caused by even modest rain.  We had about 2 inches of rain over the past few days but that hasn't been enough to really overstress the system but under the new regulations the sewage plants would be able to dump the sewage without treatment. Now they can already do this dumping under severe conditions of flood or when the system is truly in danger from flooding and would cause a greater public health threat then just dumping the sewage...while that is far from a good thing at least there is some protection ensuring that they can't dump willy-nilly. The new changes would allow for them to dump untreated sewage without having to wait for things to get bad. So it drizzles and then they dump.  Here is the action alert target link.  New EPA rules changes.   It is a perma link.  I also recieved some stuff from Jim Hightower the populast dude. I'll let the articles do the talking for me as my fingers are tired.   To many secrets, so many that there is a problem with things looking like coverups, even the Republicans find this strange as well.    Koppel is an ass and Kucinich points it out. Since when has Koppel held that much sway...and we all know not to fuck with Kucinich because he looks like he would knaw your arm off if it was in his way.    Gotta love privatization of everything....including our water. Not their water, our water. Time to speak out.   Thats all from Jim Hightower..but there is another tidbit that is starting to creep into the mainstream media and it has to do with Cheney, the French, Shell Oil, and bribery.   Will Cheney be indicted?    This is interesting because Cheney has no legal protections from overseas prosecution. He can be prosecuted and found guilty and even jailed under international extradition treaties. However this all plays out will be an interesting test of what has been long standing practice in international law adherance (although we rarely adhere to the laws)...but it will make for interesting debate as to whether or not the current regime will actually co-operate and move towards international laws and norms. I doubt it...but it would be nice to see one of our leaders essentially held hostage here in the states because if he were to travel to other nations that adhere to the laws would be bound to take Cheney into custody...how will that play. It will be interesting for sure.  I would love to see GW tried under War Crimes tribunals and be subject to arrest if he steps foot in a nation that adheres to the international laws...that would be an interesting incident.

      Well I had two posts hosed today by blogger...that sucks balls. Both were on the same thing...I tried to rewrite what I had written even more simply but it just didn't work out at all.  Now I know when I finally put together my analysys of Hilter up for people to see many will initially find it offensive that I would give that horrible man even some recognition for what he accomplished and how he single handedly remade the 20th century through his brutal wars and war crimes.  Being as such I think that if we go back and attempt to critically analyze what was happening over there and the dynamics of the situation we may find ourselves no in this day and age in a similar boat. While I would never say Bush is as bad as Hitler but I must concede that Bush is pretty close on many of his ideals.  I will have to do some research and make head to head comparisons...and I bet many will be stunned at just how closely played our game is now to how it was played then. If people were to see some of the frightening similarities to Nazi Germany and todays USA as well as the Former Soviet Union and the Stazzi Police in East Germany it may make people think differently about the whole thing.   The key will be to remove the emotional attachment to that war and the pride we rightfully won by soundly defeating our foes. In that though is where we started to steer wrong (although the invasions of the Phillipine's, Haiti, and Cuba we also early warning signs for people and our intensions.  I guess one of the things that I will have to stress as Chomsky has so well done, although in tough langauge for even more advandced readers (I consider myself a decent reader and can comprehand many things better that you average guy....yet I have some difficulty in reading and translating it into language that is easy to understand and then pass it off to people in more of a primer form.)  Now this will take time as I am only into the third chapter of Chomsky and already I feel a little overwhelmed by some of it all.   To fix our problems we must face our past and in my humble opinion we need to get our fingers out of everyones pies. The stem of hatred towards us has been through supporting very terrible men over the years and that has always come back to bite us in the ass. We should be worried.  We can make it work but first we need to bury some of our "We're Number One Pride" we have and get back to basics. We need to immediately cut all military funding to foriegn nations immediately. Especially when it comes to Turkey, Pakistan, Columbia (which now receives huge amounts only outdone by this last mention for money), and Isreal.  If we were to withdraw all military aid tensions would sure rise for a short time in those areas but the ancient tribal wars of civil wars would be solved finally. If we did that we will piss some off but it would seem that as our weapons dry up in those country people will be less likely to attribute all the crap to the USA because at least they won't be staring down the barrel of a US made M-16. That I am sure would make a world of difference.  Any aid that we must give (and yes I feel we have the moral responsibility to help the world out as much as possible) should be in the form of food and medical aid. Something that we are surprisingly good at when we out our minds to it.  We can help bring hunger under control and with what is considered drop in the bucket money for other things like making sure people have basic health care (not first world mind you right off the bat, but at least them up on vaccinations and help prevent the spread of AIDS. Also we could for a small amount of money make sure that every person should have access to clean water.  These humanitarian things would help our image elsewhere.   I also propose that while we are helping the world we help ourselves and bring our derelict equipment up to par and our roads rebuilt. These would be massive pupblic works projects that would gaurantee labor here in the states for a long time to come.  We need to cut the Military Budget...and this is something that I get into a fight with my mom and dad who insist that there are baddies all over the place and the army is our last line of defense. I know that right now we could rid ourselves of nuclear weapons and chemical weapons and still have enough conventional weapons to destroy us all.   Also my rationing is this. We know very well how to build these weapons. If we were to come under sustained attack there is nothing to say that we can't literally slap together nuclear weapons should we need them to defend ourselves. Although we would likely never have to use them.  There is a lot to talk about and I haven't gotten to Hitler. Believe me...it may anger some of you on how I think of him. I think he was evil but at the same time psychopaths can be extremely intelligent people as I have no doubt he was...maybe not a genious in the grand sense of the word...but I also give Bush some of the traits because he has similar command over what is going on often to the detrement of the country.  So once I get my post on that together I will make it available.  Oh yeah I will be moving this into a pay format cause I can get good solid deals that won't cost an arm and a leg. So now I just jave to secure a domain name and a hosting package...which could be done for around 70 a year with 2GB month transfer, and oodles of storage as well as unlimited POP3 Email boxes. That will be parlaid into what I want to do as well.  Please if you people could take just a bit of time and send me email addies for press people, reporters, TV talking heads, edititorian page moderators. I need them all so that I can make a database with them all and effectively start my plan.  Also I would like to see "question of the day questions" soon so that I can get people voting on them.  Well love to you all.   urlLink Journalists and news anchors here     urlLink Your help here     All your help will be greatly appreciated...and you may become part of the grass roots movement that will take the country back.

      Damnit I lost another post but this time due to my fat fingers hitting the wrong combination of keys. So I will repeat even more quickly what I tried to say.  The ad that has people in a tizzy seems a little off to me. The ads that Moveon.org has chosen to be finalists are all excellent and very well done but some lack perhaps the shine of proffessionalism...although again they are great and very slick in their own right.  This Bush/Hitler ad though takes it to a slightly higher production level and looks a little more pollished than the others...had it not had the message that it did and was going on technical merrit it would certainly be one of the better ads submitted because of its production value.  Now I am not saying that the RNC planted the ad, however if it came out down the road that it was a plant it would not surprise me. That kind of tactic is well withing the realms of possibility for the RNC as they have nothing better than that. The lie and manipulate and the only hopes for them to retain control requires them to deligitimise their opposition and this ad certainly helps tarnish Moveon.org's sheen up to this point.  Moveon.org should activily persue the producer of the video and if indeed it was a plant then they need to raise holy hell over it all. If it was a genuine ad from someone they need to know that as well and perhaps have the author defend his position or offer his view. Moveon.org just needs to do it to help wipe the oil off so that they don't get bogged down and labled as another "bunch of crackpots". The only way that I can see that they can do it is to out the author and then react appropriately.  Now I read an interesting article over at Commondreams.org on the DLC and the DNC showing the internal power struggle at the national level DNC.  It is a good read and you should all give it a few minutes of your time.  Interesting article that is worth the read to gain an insider view.   So today has been a whirlwind for everyone. It is just good that debate is pushing forward and we are all starting to see some honest discussion come out of it.  Also I saw Nader on Crossfire and he really stuck it to Novak shoving shit right back at his fat ass. I don't think Novak knew what to do...which was just nice because he didn't let Novak run him over and indeed challenged him to debate or discussion. As usual Novak backed down once Nader got started.  Nader basically came out and said while he supports most closely Kucinich but ceeded that he would support any of the Dems to come out on top and fight for them because the goal is simply to get George W. Bush out of office regardless of who it is that replaces him even if it is a wishy washy Dem unlike Kucinich of Dean.  So it was interesting to see.  Well I am going to rest my head for a bit...I will probably write a little later.  Peace

      Unfortunately the ad I just saw says that it was sponsored by Moveon.org but I don't believe that at all. Almost all of these ads which were independantly produced has a "sponsored by" so that it would be broadcast ready.  The ad was dead on and didn't tell any lies. All it did was compare what happened then under a leader and what is happening now under ours. Not an unfair comparison, but it will be hard to deal with and will cost a little political capital...but all will be well in time because we would be able to prove what the ad says.

      Well I have seen all the ads that are up for the grand prize and really they are all good as I have said.  There is currently a big hoopla about two ads so far that have been submitted that compares Bush to Hitler. The republicans are all up in arms and the media is in a tizzy as well.  Now I would hate to have to think that we have to compare any one of our leaders to someone who was so obviously evil like Hitler (and I have no doubt he was an evil man), but I do happen to think that Bush is skirting right on the line along with Hitler. While Bush has yet to open gas chambers or locking people off in ghettos here (yet Gauntanimo Bay is pretty close to a warsaw ghetto situation), he has certainly infringed on our rights and helped put us into a position of not being that safe.  Again it gives the republicans ammo because they can say look at how unreasonable the liberals are...blah blah blah all the while they have been attacking the liberals calling them essentially commie pinkos for wanting to have health coverage or a decent educational system. It really is a pain in the ass when you have to fight with both hands tied behind your back while they take pot shots at you and no one calls them on it.  So do I support the ads? Well I haven't seen them and I will see them tonight so I will be able to see. Do I support the idea of the ads...sure as shit I do because they have accused us of much worse so it goes to show they can dish it out but not take it. It will hurt somewhat but again as I have said in the past while the liberals and the elite educated have attempted to remain above the fray and be honorable (or at least try to appear to be) all the while you have the republicans down in the real world meddling and making things a real mess for the rest of us. So I think it is time to step off the stump and get into the mud and expect it to be ugly...we have to fight them on their turf because the people that have been voting for them all these years has been only subjected to that so when you have a softer approach the republicans have a great line in "look how soft they are". We have to be harder than them, we have to be harsher than them, we have to fight their fight and win it against them...we are smarter and shrewder...so it is time to take the fight to them and hit them where it hurts.  They are going to play the ads on Wolf-Blitzer and his tag line was that republican leaders are upset about the comparison, but remember when they had Dean and Bin-Laden in the same ad....I guess that is ok, but comparing who is undeniably not good for the country with one of the worlds worst leaders...nope you can't do that.  I have something to say about Hitler that I will voice at some point soon.  Oh here we go.  Well they weren't that bad...it is just a bunch of hoopla yet again. I have the other to watch. The Republicans can dish it out but can't take it when it comes to deeply political and personal attacks.  The Republicans can attack Max Cleland who lost three limbs in Vietnam calling him un-patriotic. They can attack one of their own John McCain saying that he fathered a child out of wedlock (which is a flat lie...he adopted an Asian child with his wife)...so they can dish it out but can't stand it when the fight is brought to them because that is their tactic and when it is used against them they have to become creative to retaliate...and republicans aren't that creative.  So just remember what they are all about. The are chickens and can't really stand in a fight as shown by how many of them or their children actually have served in active duty military roles...yeah. Try to find them in the Republican party and you won't find any...

      Today I recieved an email from Moveon.org and their campaign Bushin30seconds.org.  Well the finalists that they have chosen are really the bomb. The several clips that they have chosen are all the cream of the crop and several of them are really hard hitting and get to the point of the whole campaign easily and with great impact.

      Well I was extremely thrilled today to get a email responce from Mr. Noam Chomsky on an email I had sent to him voicing my concerns over Pakistan.  It was short and to the point and while it held little information from him it is still nice to think that he took a look at my argument if even only for a minute or two. I would never pretend to even be on his level politically or with the vast amount of information that I know he has amased over the years.  I really don't have much to say tonight outside of I caught literally the tail end of the Democratic Debate where they were all giving their 45 second spiels. I hate that any candidate be mandated to limiting his/her time to get a sound bite. That is the downfall of our democracy and our system. We have become to dependant on sound bites and tid-bits of information. People have seemed to loose the ability to have an attention span for anything more than five minutes or so...even when it is of such national  urgency.  I will say it now and I will continue to say it in the future. I personally believe that all "politicians" are worthless because of their very design. The problem is that under our system or the way we have been brought up to think is that we need these guys to run things for us. So seeing that we are trapped at the moment with the flawed system the best we can do is just try and figure out who will be the least threatening to us and the rest of the world.  Now I have made my choice of whom I support...and you can clearly see it in my links. I support Dean. I don't blindly support him and there are many things that I see differently from him on...but in the grand scheme of things he holds the best balance of things for me personally at this point in time.  If I were to have my way I would vote Kucinich and I may do that in the primaries not because I want to sabotage Dean...but because I believe in my vote and would at least want it to count for something at some point. I suspect Dean will get the nod and it looks to be that way so using my vote for Kucinich wouldn't be a waste as he unfortunately stands no chance even in the Primaries (which pound for pound his ideas and policy statements are better than any of the other candidates combined...as well as his record for action. For years he was critisized for taking the stands he did as mayor of Cleveland or wherever but it has come round to hey he did the right thing even in the face of the corporate monster.)  I wish more people could see these men stripped of their ambitions and see them for what they really are. All of them are pretty equal in their drive to control (Kucinich at least seems to want to use the power for good, Dean to not do any more harm) things.   Maybe one day once our system falls into disarray (as it is rapidly doing) we can move back towards a more organic form of government and something that will actually serve the public and be in its interest. However I fear that we will have to wait a while for that to happen (and really I have no clue what kind of government that would be because I have not studied it at all...but I am sure it would be more fudal perhaps more anarchistic with less top heavy structure as it is now).  Well again I was thrilled to get a short Email from Mr. Chomsky and I look forward to finishing his book...and again as I have said my impressions on Mr. Chomsky is that he doesn't seem to tell you how to think...but to just think and come up with your own conclusions...and in todays academic world that is almost like heresy...thinking isn't allowed when it comes to social consiousness.  So go be good little doobies and think for yourselves. Read, amass knowledge, decide, and act for yourselves. As long as you allow yourself to be lead you will always be last and the least of the leaders concerns.

      I need a flavor from my readers. I need for you all to help me gather Email addresses of as many news outlets that you can find. ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, CNN, CNNHN. I am looking for specific email addresses for on air talent as well as behind the scenes people.   This is the first step in what I want to do and if you could find it in your hearts to help me compile lists of emails addresses it would greatly be of help.  I will be giving out gifts to the top ten or so contributors. I have not decided what that will be yet but I am willing to take ideas on what I should give away for you hard work. It could be gift cards, or something else (remember I am still pretty broke so the gifts will have to be reasonable...maybe something like 20 dollar main prize and then steps down from there.)  The hosting package that I am looking at will also include unlimited POP3 email addresses which could also be up for grabs for top contributors.  I think I have found a host that will give me decent bandwidth and space for around 8 bucks a month. It will be an interesting thing to get started.  you can send the emails here   urlLink Send Email Addies here   Just take a little time and help me out. This is the first step that I can figure out on how to get on my journey.  I will also be calling for volunteers at some point to help me with some of the site coding as I am not the bomb diggity in that yet....so I will need to inlist outside help.  As I get replies that are serious I will outlie my ideals even further to those people. The idea is to get co-operation on an unprecedented level to get out media back. It may not work at first but the idea that I have can and will gain steam as well ratched up pressure.  Please help out if you can. Right now I need no money, just time and research time. Later I will need help maintaining for which anyone who helps on that end would be rewarded off of any profit we may make or attention we gather. My whole idea is to make this about the people, not myself, or my ideals, but the people and their ideas.  So help is greatly appreciated....and I do welcome all comers no matter what your party affiliation because ultimately the ideal will extend to confront both sides of the isle and with dogged determination we can at least hold them accountable.  Peace...and don't forget to send me those email addresses (CNN, CBS, FOX, ABC, NBC bigwigs...all of them).  Mike

      Well Nasa has made it with their little probe to Mars...after some of their more devestating catastrophies it is about time that the boys out there get some good news.  Congrats guys and I hope that we are able to find some interesting things.  Love to all of you...you rocket scientists.

      I had said that I was going to write about Bush and his call for the moon and Mars.  I have been struggling with what to do or think about this all. I am really torn in that I personally think we should already be well on the road towards those goals and should have never abandoned our space program as we did back in the mid eighties. Yes we abandoned it. After Challenger we pretty much just let it go and have never really made any attempt to get back in the "race".   Once we lost Werner Von Braun and his true vision we lost our way. Von Braun was undoubtedly the father of our space program in its current form (along with Goddard to a lesser degree). Braun had planned to have us on Mars already with semi-permanent moon bases as the launching pad for the cosmos. Many would say that he was a horrible man that helped enable Hitler to strike terror into the Brits and also helped allow for the killing of the Jews. Werner was never that political. He was first and foremost a scientist hell bent on one thing. Building rockets to go to the moon.  At the end of WW2 we were lucky enough for him to know which side to join (ours and not the Soviets...he dissapeared and sought out our forces for surrender). We got him and brought him initially to Alabama (the reason was because Alabama at the time suprisingly is reminicent of Germany without the extreme cold weather. So he was there and started to work. Initially he was working on a modified version of his V2 to deliver weapons for the military. Again he still wanted to go to the moon...but alas he was still stuck with developing weapons.  Soon Kennedy issued his challenge to the US and the World. Von Braun now had a mission. Get a man to the moon and back.  Well we all know how it ended...we got there.  Now we lost the initiative in the late seventies because space was expensive and the Rusians had given up on the moon and were working on space stations and such. So we put modest effort into a space station. We also designed and built the Space Shuttle (or STS).  The Space Shuttle was at first thought of that it would "make money". They would be able to turn shuttles around every couple of weeks and they would carry payloads to space for the military and others...essentially they would rent out their cargo capacity and pay for the program. Well that never worked really well..  We have now had two of them go down. One was because of gross negligence on the part of NASA bean counters, the other was a fluke that had been foreseen but nothing done about it.  NASA has an anual budget of around 15-20 billion...and this is practically nothing in the budget...the numbers have been pretty consistant over the years...while not technically the budget hasn't been cut all these years, but as a percentage or value the budget has shrunk.  Bush has proposed we head back to the moon and soon, then head off to Mars. What he didn't do is actually figure out how much it would cost or how he would pay for it. He asked for modest increases in funding (a billion over several years with massive fund redirection within NASA itself).  Now one thing we should have learned coming out of the eighties is that you can not have a stingy budget on time or money. When you do that you get accidents and you actually see costs rise.  The perverse thing about it all is for the relatively low amount of money we have put into the space program since its inception we have seen (I heard the figure somewhere...if I can find it I will post it) over 20 trillion dollars of economic activity from the small investment. It has been simply the best investment that the government has ever made.  We do need to go. We need to be back on the moon. We need to go to Mars...we need to do it because we are human and we have the urge to explore. It is in us.  The administration wants to make this into an evil thing though...they want to do it unilaterally so they can militarize. That is wrong.  I would propose that instead of competing against the Chinese or any other nation we need to involve them for the same goal. We need all of the world on this because it will truely be a huge task. The moon is easy. In flight times it is insugnificant. Mars is a tad different.   We need the Russians because they have the long term space exposure experience. With them and the drive of the Chinese, Japanese Space Agency, European Space Agency...all the rest we could get there easier and with less risk overall. If we involve all the people of the planet in this goal than we can make the world better.  Bush doesn't want that...co-operation means that we have to loose...we have to loose our "need" to be number one. We can do it...but it will take time.  I wish that this idea wasn't so politicized because really going to the moon and mars would be great, and be good for the world...unfortunately it likely isn't going happen under the current administration.  I could ramble on about this for a long long time...we need to do it...not because we need to be number one...but because we need to make a move back towards that pioneering spirit and the drive to get things done right.  I dunno...we could just do so much better.

      I am getting sicker I think...that sucks balls.  My mouth is now pretty much raw and my chest hurts a lot now...and now my throat is sore and the glands are swollen.  I have Jesse's computer to build...I just have to figure out when he can get out here to do that because I need to get back to my house so I can get all the tools and extra bits that I will need to make his system run.  So maybe tomorrow I can escape for the few hours that I will need to get what I need...it would take me maybe two or three hours to get together what all I would need...it is just getting there and really going at it hard for a few hours and then get back here and relax for a bit...that would also give me the oportunity to get the right discs I need to rebuild this laptop...I wanna move it to Window XP Pro Corp...ya know cause it is better than XP Home.  I just need to get the bits together and get it all running...probably the only thing that I won't be able to do here at the hospital is do the updates to the operating systems...just because they are large downloads and so far my ethernet port here in the room is not yet active...  I will have to bring my box down just to get software off of it...but then I can send it home after I get Jesse up and running because I know I have all the software on my main box...so I can get somethings updated...and others won't...  Baaaa....well it is time for me to get more drugs...benadryl and percocet...oh yeah....get to shudder for a while then maybe sleep...  Peace...this next few days is gonna get hectic...real fast like.

      The corruption just stinks...we all know it is happening because we can just feel it in our guts.   Ashcroft not only looses to a dead man but had to cheat and still lost!   We all know we need health care...just another call for it based off of accounting... We can save the system only by going one payer.   In the darkest of places even light shines in. Workers are rising slowly but surely and will soon be able to fix the mess. What is funny is that Labor unions and other unions have finally figured out that their struggle is not only in the factories where they are based but also around the globe with others that do the same job. You protect all your sector workers and the collective boat risis, you protect but your factory it can be isolated and cut off thereby making yourself the greatest obsticle to making it work. It has taken the unions way to long to figure it out...but hey better late than never.  Nafta Ten Years on.   A good commentary on kitchen politics...very well written and to the point on everything.  Kitchen-Table State of the Union.   We all know that they will never get to the leaker or Joe Wilson's wife.  Here is why.   We should all be mad...we should all be screaming bloody murder...we should all be out in the streets with signs and then into the voting booth to get this absolutely horrible regime out of the White House.  Dean has been slipping in Iowa...or so it would seem. I would like to know the method of testing. Is he truly loosing votes or is each poll a little larger net casting than the old with more people giving voice to their opinion. If it is more people signing up and voicing their opinions than his numbers aren't shrinking but still growing however not at the same pace as the others.  I was watching on CNN interviews with Caucus goers and they were surprisingly engaged. More so than most Americans and it made me wonder...what if we all had caucus style elections then maybe it would engage people, not just politicians, but people in the process. Really this contest is a form of debate amongst people...not politicians. This is great news because people are taking back the process.  Regardless of who you support be engaged at the "grass roots" level. We also need to rename "grass roots" because it is outmoded and doesn't give credit to those who are truly involved...I am grass roots by definition, but it doesn't mean I am out with a sign and buttons (although if I were healthy enough I would be)...maybe we should call this group "The People".   When it comes down to it we have to interact with each other...I interact with you all through this blog...some interact in person...some just put a sticker on their car...maybe we need to have several classes of "The People"...not classes like you are = x classes...but instead classes or specialists on things. For me I would be a speechgiver, someone else would be the bumper sticker sticker, someone else with another job. We all know that campaigns are already broken down that way...but call of the people in that office "grass roots" when they really aren't. They are the people.  Call them what they are...exhault them for their work...recognize that every cog in the wheel is important from the guy that goes on the news for his candidate down to the 15 year old in the office licking stamps (hey I did that...and got a healthy liking for stamp glue...hehehehe).   Well I am going to read some more...the day is still shitty...but after I got that post out of the way below...I have felt a little better...  Peace

      Today is shit. Really it is.  I feel like hell...my mouth has nearly gone completely raw and I have these little blister type things in there...skin is peeling...and overall everything tastes like metal. It is really annoying and now my glands are getting swollen and my throat is getting a tad sore.  I also talked with my grandmother and she isn't well right now. She has been going through a lot of shit lately. She has had this pain in her side and cancer markers have continued to rise. I know she is really worried.   What makes me upset is that they haven't really done more...they have needed to stop with the CATs and MRIs and Bone Density Scans and just went in and get a damn sample of it so they know for sure what it is...but what worries me is it isn't where they thought it was...it is in her tailbone not her ribs like where they have been concentrating. So it has gone almost ignored completely until now.  I don't know what it is...but I know this I can't loose her right now. I really can't. I love her dearly and I am so worried about this. I have gained great strength in knowing she was there...always has been and always would be.   I rely on her for so much that no one could ever know. I can make money, I can make my way, I can do all that...what I cannot do is see her in pain again or have to see her go through all that again. I don't know if I have the strength to do it...I will of coarse do what it takes in the end...I just don't want to have to...  With all that has gone on lately in and around all of my families lives...we are just in a big mess. My grandfather is sick and will die soon (we think, hope, and pray...no that isn't mean it is merciful), my grandmother is fighting whatever this is and has been dicked around since March of last year to figure out what is wrong. My mom has pnuemonia I am sure...she was in here hacking and coughing. She sounds worse than I do....no matter what anyone tells her she is right and she won't take the time to go to a doctor and just get something for it. It is something that could be fixed in a matter of days...but by delaying it she has not only put her health in risk but mine and my grandmothers. (my grandmother has the same cough that my mom has now...she got whatever it was from mom and my cough has changed from a sharp cough to a gurgle just like my moms....so she has helped us all get sicker...yet doesn't seem to get it even though it has been pointed out...she just acts repugnant about it all...if you are reading this...just go to the damn doctors and get the meds that you need...I don't want to have to tell you not to come because you are making me worse or GM worse...it is simple, you are stubborn...and through that stubborness throughout your life you have always done this and always made things worse by not even doing anything about it).  I am done with that...she knows what she needs to do...will she do it. No she won't because after all she knows better than a doctor.  My shit has gotten worse and I don't know what is going on...I know but I don't. My mouth is raw (as I said), my kidneys are screwed up again (they hurt), my hips and knees are all buggered up (they hurt)...it is all just a mess and my cough has changed from a sharp hacking cough to a more gurgling slick cough...There is stuff there but I can't get to it...plus I just feel like shit.  I hate to complaign...I really do...but it is all I can muster right now.  Peace  And send good thoughts towards my grandmother. She needs them.

      Well my mom and grandmother got me a new laptop...a really nice one. It is a Toshiba Satellite M35-S359  Intel Pentium M 1.4Ghz 512 MB RAM 60GB HD Nvidia FX GO5200 32MB RAM Cenrino wireless setup as well.  This damn thing screams along pretty fast I must say...the keyboard is a little bigger...well a lot bigger and I am having to get used to it. Strange....  Also the screen is crispy clear...very nice...no ghosting at all (my old Tohiba suffered horribly from ghosting)....the only thing that I could gripe about is the keyboard flexes a little much...so I will just have to re-learn typing...but damn I am impressed.  I am going to return the Portable DVD player I got for christmas to put that money towards this..because this has a DVD player (as well as CD-RW on it) so I don't need the extra DVD player.  I am just thrilled....giddy as a little school girl...look at me oh so pretty as I prance round in my catholic school girl outfit....weee weee!  Ok...well I am tired and I do actually need some sleep...and I have a lot to read before I get to sleep....  Oh yeah the connections here in the room aren't active yet...so I am on my Cell Phone which is still kewl as hell...this thing has all the connections Ethernet, Modem, Cell Phone, 802.11B...just missing Bluetooth (but I have no use for it)...it is just damn fine :-)  Thanks mom and GM...love ya'll lots.

      Well today I had a trajedy occur. I had asked for a heat blanket and when they finally got it to me and they were hooking it up water sprayed out of the damn thing and soaked my laptop. Killed it deader than an upsidedown armadillo...now don't that just suck.  So I am without computer...and really I can't do much about it right now...I think I am going to look for a new laptop...something that isn't uber but instead spartan with enough oomph to get by....  I have a couple of that I am looking at...or rather I have kept my eye on...so maybe one of those will do. I could bring my big computer down...but that is a hassle and frankly if that were to get broken I would really be ass out.  So...updates over the next few days will suck...even if I update simply because I am using a semi-public lab and I don't want to broadcast everything out there....especially over a network that I am not completely confident of...when I get another computer and get hooked up to the network here at Shadyside Hospital (we move tomorrow to the redone floor and I should end up getting a suite with internet access) I will have to see what it is...and how private it will be...it it ain't private enough than I still have my SprintPCS Vision service...and I am a little more confident in the security of that than a UPMC network...  Well I have some shopping to do...peace ya'll.

      Just saw this on CNN and it is so touching. If we could all aspire to be half as good as this man seemed to be then we would be so better off.  I plan to try and do something on this front...because it is the right thing to do.   SSSSH   That concludes the good deed work today.

      Just got back from my PFT's (Pulmonary Function Tests) and they still suck. They have not improved at all.  An interesting thing did happen though right before I went down...I started coughing up blood. Woohoooo! So something is mad in there.  I just want to feel somewhat better....and I don't I just feel like I am standing still sliding backwards.  I have figured out how to fight back against the Neo-Conservative movement by taking a look at it.   You have to give them one thing...they are very well orchestrated, organized, and compartmentalized. Each person has a specific function. You have the politicos, the mud slingers, the misinformers...each person has a function and they do that function only. You can see it all over Washington right now. While they sometimes infight they mainly stick on message.  So to combat that we need to be as organized and make sure that we have a person at every forum they are at. Each person we send will become an expert on the person and that persons area in the Neo-Con movement. In other words shock troops. Are people would have to be aggresive and on point all the time. Everytime Perle shows up on a show we have Mr. X there to combat them on air backed with facts.   They say one thing but are doing something different...then we show it on paper or in graphics. Now the problem is that we will be chasing them all the time so we will have to at some point go on the attack and change the debate to our positions.  It will take many resources and we will have to give chase but at this point it is what we can do. We just need to systematically take them on as they did us years ago. As we get stronger we can then change the debate and make the changes that we all need.  Ponder....

      Kim Alfano...the new RNC cheerleader...Coulter has been sidelined it seems. I have seen Kim on a lot lately. I guess maybe finally people have realized that Coulter is just some idiot that got a law degree and then styled herself as a person of the people all the while wearing Cartier and Prada...she can't speak for more that three seconds without a lie coming out of her mouth...not to mention her whole age thing...she doesn't even know how old she is...or at least officially she doesn't know.  Now I will throw Kim a bone here cause she is new and really inexperienced...so here is my advice dear. Start talking crazy...oh wait you've got that already...hell go do some guest spots on Rush and maybe Hannity.   She is fresh faced and so far hasn't really made an ass out of herself to much except that she doesn't know the truth and still does lie...but I don't think she has had time to wrestle with that nasty little voice in her head that has to be telling her that she is lieing...lets hope we can save just one from the evil clutches of the Republicans.  Well I am off to surf and look at notebooks....I think I have decided on something...it won't be uber box...but smaller and more portable for guerilla work on the road...just needs to be reasonably fast but long on battery life and small in size.  I am leaning towards a Sony sub-notebook....a little more expensive but more useful and stylish...it would be good because then I can have it with me all the time. I would like to get something at around 3-4 pounds ready weight...so I will be cutting myself out of bigger laptops and higher power graphics...but if it is small and with a 12 or 13 inch screen I won't want to game all that much on it anyway. Just as long as the graphics are reasonably snappy.  Peace...off to see if I can find something to fit the bill.

      Well today they have a bunch of little twinkies running around pretending to be nurses...it is almost funny.  Well today I go down for a flow loop to see how my lungs are doing. I know that they haven't come back because I can feel it. So we will see what happens a little later.  I am just now tired and weary...but hey...I will be getting out sooner or later.  I will be back on later I am sure.  Moveon.org anounced the winner for the bushin30seconds.org award. Without further ado  The winners .  The real war begins now...and Bush is all out of ammo. Go ahead pull Osama out of a hidey hole...it still doesn't make us safer...and if it does are you going to repeal all the laws that you have placed on us that strips us of our rights...I doubt it. I think that even if we find the "boogy man" our rights will be clamped down even tighter than before.  In the end we will win. They are but a few...we are the masses.

      You know its bad when the Swedes are after ya.  I think this is a great idea and I hope they can find a way to send money to help us get Bush out of office.   Democracy Aid 04'   We unfortunately need a little lesson in how things are run...and again I hope they can find a way to get the money here so we can fight Bush.  The writing is on the wall...now all we have to do is read it!  I think you'll like the Idea B. It really is original and very well thought out. They make no recomendation on who to vote for...only a recomondation of who not to vote for.  They have a link to some law on it all at  Findlaw .  Not only do they make safe cars...but they want to make the world safe...they are just such a great people...

      I got a nice short message from an old friend today. I won't mention her name right now just simply because I want things to move forward and all be well.  Thank you for you kind words and always know that I have never held any ill will towards you or anyone around you. I hope that things are going well over at your place...and I hope your family is well.  I am doing ok myself...things are rough but I always know that I will land right side up cause they just can't keep me down.  Well I will leave it at that...and just know that I do really care for you and I am sorry for all the crap that passed between us all...I had never intended for things to get so bad or out of hand...and I just hope that you can forgive me for any harsh words that I have pointed at you.  Peace :-)

      I thought I lost that post below because of this piece of shit laptop....I am so tempted to just hop onto that one site and order a laptop and then just face the music for me putting 1600 on a credit card...  But because I am now "responsible" I won't...but it is soooo tempting. If I were working more regularly than I wouldn't hesitate...but I am not...so I will wait.  Oh well I will let this little thing crawl along until it truely dies. Then I will get something newer that will work.  blah...

      I am now in ICU because of my alergic reaction like it is something new. I have had an alergic reaction since the first day I have been on the cefepime...it is in the same family og Zosyn abd Miripenam...all pennicillian family members...so I am just alergic to them.  Just pump me full of benadryl and steroids and all will be well...I am pretty good at screaming when something is wrong...so just lemme be and lemme be drugged.  I missed the O'Niel interview on 60 min. tonight...I really wanted to see it just to see what he was going to say...oh well I am sure I can find it somewhere on the net.  Well they don't know I am connected using my Cell Phone...hehehe I am a sneaky bastard...and they don't need to know.   I have to get over and rebut something I read on another forum and make my mark....actually it will be pretty easy to do seeing the argument the guy made was just retarded. I have a new place to play...and a new place to try and spread the love.  I have said it before and I will say it over and over and over again. I don't want to make up your mind for you...I don't want to be your "guru" or leader...instead I want you to learn to think for yourself...regardless of where it takes you even if it is polar opposite to what I think or feel.  I just want to make sure that people get to their conclusions through serious thought and through good fact based sources. Don't just recite jingles or tow the party line. Fifteen second sound bites are no longer acceptable in these times. If you choose to go with these little sound bites or choose to over simplify a problem then you should be relegated to obscurity.  People like Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson, Karl Rove, Sean Hannity, Anne Coulter, and all those people on that side really aren't all that smart when it comes down to it. Sure they have been successful in spreading their lies and puffing out their chests and making "the liberals fear them"...but in reality we don't fear them, at least I don't...and it is because I know to my bones that these people are not moral people. If they were moral people then they would not attack in the manor they do. They rarely even attempt to debate on issues because all they know is the overly simplified explanation of most issues that have been spoon fed to them by whomever was their "guru" during their formative years. They rarely can stand without each other and you will rarely see them entering into the fray unless they have backup.  They have a shark pack mentality and as soon as they smell blood they attack. I call them sharks instead of wolves because sharks lack spine...they are really a rather fragile animal once you get past their tough skin (a good example can be seen in Rush and how he is now the "target" or the liberal law enforcement and courts for his illegal actions...I have something to say on that later) they really are nothing but a bunch of mixed up diseased parts that in reality would simply die off if they didn't have the tough skin.  We don't need to be afraid of them...instead we need to dismiss them. Their views are not valid, their ideas are not original (because they all keep clucking around the chicken pen repeating the same things over and over), and they are just morally bankrupt.  We as people...not liberals or conservatives need to rise up against these people and just tell them to head back to the looney farm with their ideas.  One of these days I will outline how and why I think the way I do about our system and then show that even communism isn't valid in the end because it was taken back to the rich.  I want people to be prosperous, I want for us all to live in some form or mode of modernality that allows people to really be free...however as long as we have radicals on only one side of the fence (and that is the conservative side in my view) then we will never be able to break the shackles that bind us to this horrible fate that awaits. We have to make a consious effort to figure out why things are happening and then remedy them. To oversimplify now only condems people to continue to repeat the mistakes of the past.  Challenge them on their own turf and I bet you they will crumble and fall off into the sea. Once that happens we can then move on.

      Sorry no real posts today...I feel like shit.  This one bothers me...and it makes me frightened...   Does this mean I loose too? I hope not...and I thank the taxpayer for keeping me alive.   Bush has got to go...if he isn't deposed we all loose...and we will all suffer. Believe me health care is of the utmost importance. We as a nation cannot afford to ignore and not have national health care now. If we ignore it and continue gleafully down the path we are on we will assure ourselves our own extinction. This is not alarmest of fear mongering...our health care system is in such a state of shambles that we cannot even get enough flu-vaccine and children die.   With how the virii and the bacteria are mutating ever faster in the face of our drugs...and the fact that many people are breeding these little super bugs and not getting adequate care or sub-standard care and only half runs of suitable anti-biotics that don't kill but ultimately strengthen the little buggers. Those little buggers propogate and soon all we have are very stubborn bugs and no drugs to treat them. Now all bugs will become resistant to anti-biotics over a long enough timeline.   We only shorten that timeline by not having adequate care for those who are sick.  We can only beat them or have a shot at beating them if we go national and have a concentrated effort towards genetic drugs, therapy, and modified anti-biotics...maybe even creating our own super-bio killer bug that kills all the bad ones yet allows people to be safe.  That is the only way we can even attempt to survive. We must do this now before we all die.  Down with Bush, up with Dean or Kucinich...up with anyone who is at least a good man.

      Well I have my laptop all tuned out and it is hella fast. I got most of that done last night. There are just some niggling things that I wonder about.  Such as...  Centrino technology. With this new processor the Pentium M it has an uber cache on it. 1MB of L3 cache along with the smaller L1 and L2 cache. Now they have for this on the restore disk a more aggressive setting for L3...I wonder what the registry entry is? What does it do. They also have an .inf file for the Pentium M that you install and from what I can tell it does indeed seem to speed things up, but what is it doing.  Also there are a other niggling bits here and there but overall it is performing well above what I would expect. I have a pretty fast computer at home and it runs really well and fast. Going from that to my old laptop was like torture. The old laptop was a 366Mhz Celeron with 192MB RAM. So it was a huge step back (well at least since I really upgraded my systems...when I had my Gateway it was a 333Mhz Celeron as well...then it wasn't really a speed difference)...but going from P4 to Celeron was like someone had just kicked me in the groin. Now going from my P4 to this Pentium M I must say that I don't see much of a difference even though the actual clock difference is around 1Ghz from 1.4 on this laptop to 2.4 on my desktop (its overclocked). My laptop has 512MB RAM (yeah hella sweet) and it runs fast but not much slower than the 1GB of faster RAM in my desktop (which is also dual channel unlike the single channel on the laptop). I have a decent Video card in the desktop...good middle of the road nVidia gear...and on the laptop I have an FX5200GO with only 32MB RAM...it isn't balls out fast and probably will lag greatly on Half Life 2...but in SOF2: Double Helix it runs well and I don't see many frames skipped or mis-rendered..it runs really well.  So what does this mean...have laptops finally come up to the point that we really don't need desktop boxes anymore? I am going to venture and say for most people yes...laptops are finally at the nexus where you can get a decent laptop that is perfectly respectable and able to do most of the tasks that a full size computer can do. Sure they have a slight price premium...usually around 200-300 for comporable setups...and sure you can always get the latest and greatest bleeding edge graphics and sound for your desktop...but that is changing in laptops. Right now you have good video in many of the higher dollar machines. You can get a Radeon 9600Pro 128MB for laptops on the high end...not balls out blazing like the latest greatest 9800XT 256MB...but the 9600PRO chip for mobiles is damn fast and really remember that for everything most people do that card will be perfectly capable for several years at least until the next Windows OS (Longhorn) comes out. Also there has been a push to make things in laptops truly upgradeable...we now have some platforms that you can swap in and out a nVidia FX5700GO 128MB to a ATI 9600Pro 128MB with little fuss.  So things are changing...and I believe that I will probably be investing more and more into laptops and mobile systems simply because they have finally hit the point where even though desktops will always have the latest and greatest and fastest...but the laptop is just behind them giving the option of being able to carry a world class computer with you without having to tote a big heavy box, monitor, and the rest...when carrying a laptop is a relatively simple affair...one case, one power brick (if you plan to charge or use your laptop more than a few hours), a mouse if you must (I carry one because integrated pointers anymore are great but I love the mouse), and then other things that you may want...all in less than 20 pounds.  So I will probably be swinging that way...maybe getting several notebooks each for specific missions. Maybe someday a Sony ultra portable (those small 3.5 pound babies with small 10-12" screens and a Centrino 1Ghz) and then an uber P4-3.20Ghz 17" Ati 9600Pro 128MB, 2*60GB 7200RPM Raid 0 HDs, 1GB of PC4000 RAM, DVD+-RW/CR-RW and a host of other goodies...then get a Tablet PC.  Each for its own use...each different for specific tasks...a lot of money and only a dream...but certainly would still weigh less that one uber-box...and infinitely more portable...so that is my new mandate...no more desktops...only laptops or portables for this guy.  I may actually write something of value later tonight...the past couple of days have been rough and I haven't felt all that good. All my meds have been readjusted upwards. Now I am on more of everything and I am having to cope with it all. However at least they have upped my pain meds as well because that is the hardest thing...and now at least I am not having as much pain as I have had over the past few days (it came with higher doses of steroids)...so as I get to feeling better I am sure I will write more...

      I am watching the 6th Day and I must say it is an interesting movie. Visually the graphics are a little cheesy but I love those heli-planes things...the concept is sound...it would just need a lot of work to get it to that point. We could do it.  Today I got a good two hour nap and I feel a little better overall. I just wish I could get some good sleep so far though...it ain't happening.   I got my wireless router and got it all set up...now I am waiting on my port to be activated. I even set up the security on it. Once I read a little about it the thing was easy to setup. It has some pretty amazing features on it. I am impressed. Now I just need to get the rebates printed out and sent off so I can get my money back on it. Basically I got it for 39 bucks...and it has a four port router on it as well...that is k-rad...and the box itself is attractive. I may have to get some more wireless equipment at some point.  Also Intel is introducing Centrino 802.11G now...so I will probably upgrade my wireless setup to that...they will offer the mini-pci card plugins and you will be able to replace it and still have full Centrino certification. It will upgrade it from 11mbps to 52mbps wireless. Plus it is backwards compatible.  I am going to get a candy bar...and did I mention I love this laptop...I mean it is really k-rad..and even with me having to access through my cell phone...it is still damn fast!  Baaa

      Well JPL lost control of the plucky little Mars Rover...they describe the problem as that the craft has gone into "safe mode"...so I guess even Microsoft can screw up a glorified remote control atv. I can just see it...there is this mutli-million dollar machine sitting out there probably with a little LCD screen glowing a glorius blue with a cryptic message of numbers, periods, letters, and the message if this is the first time you are seeing this screen....  The Rover has BSOD'd....that is so funny! Well I dunno if it did or not...but I guess you could compare its safe mode with that of Windows...hehehehe..and we all know that safe mode is preceeded by a BSOD.  Oh boy...I am sure those rocket scientists will be able to get it back up and running.

      This movie or documentary or whatever it is about Noam Chomsky and his book Manufacturing Consent is really damn good. It really goes a long way to explain what is going on...especially now in the media.  It is a long thing to watch...but it is great and tells a great story. It is something that people should burn a few brain cells and think on...he really is a great mind and what is great is that he offers them for free...he gives them to you freely. All he asks in return is you think about it...and that is all I want for people to do when I post my thoughts or ideas...just think about them. You don't have to agree with them and can even be combative with your view...I support that because I support free speech and I support your right to be whatever or whomever you want as long as you afford me the same right.  All this is in jeapordy right now because the Republicans are trying to clamp down on free speech and dissent of anything the president or the cabinet espouses. If you dissent you are un-patriotic...calling people those names isn't appropriate because how do you defend against that? You can't just say "well I am not a Nazi"...the damage is already done. The person who the charge has been levied against simply cannot dispute a charge like that.  Watch the movie. You will see.

      Bush in Arizona I think and is stumping for the Patriot Act...it is so transparent it isn't even worth ranting about.  He is of course in front of a friendly audience (mainly military)...but what I don't understand is why those guys are clapping because it is their asses that are being put on the line and all the while the Administration is cutting funding for pay, housing, health care...all for the military.  I just don't get it...I really don't...the military should be the most upset about all this policy and crap...but they seem to like dieing without cause and going to war under tha false pretense of WMD's and now Liberty.  I just don't get it.

      I want to clear something up real quicklike...what I was saying in this previous post is that we changed the debate and we forced the rest of the candidates to take on our issues...we also forced the President to do the same...as we watched in the SOTU speech last night he has had to put his grand plans on hold so he can come back and fight the issues that we are pushing, not what Rove, Rummy, RNC, DNC, and DLC were trying to push on us. Instead we made them all step back and have to deal with the issues as we see them.  For that our movement is defined even more so tha Dean himself. We are behind him of coarse but as he likes to put it without our support he and the issues are dead and we seed our authority as voters to special interests. We have taken it back and made it ours once again.

      Thank you Michael Moore...we Dean supporters needed to hear that from someone outside of our camp.  While you support Clark and we support Dean we just needed some validation that what we are doing is resonating within the community at large. I wasn't so much shocked that we lost Iowa as I was dissapointed that we didn't carry a larger percentage overall.  While it was a loss there were some bright spots and Michael Moore points them out quite well. We didn't loose at all we actually won...all of us won big. We proved that we could bring out the vote through our new tactics of online activism and through our Drive. While we didn't carry the caucus we got the vote out and we nearly doubled the turnout from four years ago. That is an accomplishment because we came in and shocked the party back to life.  All of the Issues that Dean has brought to the front have become the issues. We are no longer tap dancing around things and we have finally started to get "god, guns, and gays" out of the debate...or at least we are trying. The real needs are being debated such as education (which would have been pushed to the back burner yet again if it hadn't been for some brave people to stand up and say "no child left behind" has failed), health care.  Why do we know they are on the table...because Bush put them back on the table last night. By doing that whomever the democratic candidate is that runs will now have the onus to point out the Presidents failure to even fund his pet projects instead choosing to give out huge subsidies to his health care buddies.  So Dean supporters we need not dispair because regardless of how the chips fall, our message has been sent out and received loud and clear. We want change and we will make it change period. No more of the same. No more mediocrity. We have already taken back the process...now we just need to take back the country.  Thank you Mr. Moore for giving credit where credit is due.    Michael Moore's Encouragement to Deniacs.

      SOTU Day plus one.  All the media seems to be able to come up with is that Teddy scowled and Bush threw daggers.  The Republicans are now saying it was inappropriate for the Democrats (especially Kennedy) should not have been so openly disapproving of the President how Kennedy seems to be challenging the President.  Now this is when I really have to start to get very very angry. Disapproval and dissent is part of our Democracy. Calling into question any policy by any politician on any side is never hate speech, it is never questioning someone?s patriotism, it is never inappropriate to have open public debate on any policy that faces our nation.   If you are one of the pundants or people who have said or say "well he commands respect because he is the president and he shouldn't have been doing that, it was disrespectful"...you need to shut up and stop that.   Yes shut up and stop that. If you attempt to curb debate on an issue because you think it is hateful to question your position than you are no better than a hardliner Communist or a hard line Nazi. They both curbed public discourse, called their opponents un-patriotic, everything that the Republicans are saying about Democrats lately.   There has been a lot of fuss about some people comparing Bush to Hitler and many groups have come out and said that is anti-Semitic, wrong, and hateful. I am sorry I don't agree with any of those arguments especially considering that the Republicans have been using the same tactic against Democrats for years calling them Socialists and Communists...saying that the Democratic way is the way towards destruction and away from freedom.  It is ok when the Republicans engage in that tactic but it isn't ok when Democrats even say "hey that isn't right!?  What do I have to base this on...how do I come this way. Well I read and watch TV and I see what they do.  They compared Max Cleland of GA, a veteran of Vietnam who lost three limbs (he is a democrat), to Osama in a commercial because Sen. Cleland openly questioned the Presidents policy on the "War on Terrorism" pondering whether or not a different approach could achieve the same goals and whatnot. He also questioned tax cuts and other Bush policy. So the Republican Party put together a commercial that had Cleland and Osama in the same frames (albeit only for a second or two...but enough for even a slow brain to register) and said that because Cleland wasn't supporting the President and his policies then Cleland might as well have been for the terrorists.  This didn't raise the ire of the press or the Republicans because it was in their interest...the Dems didn't make enough of a stink of it. It was just passed over and left behind. The campaign was successful and Cleland lost his seat and a Republican was installed.  In the New York Post just recently one of their columnists wrote a piece on Dean and his supporters comparing their flannel shirts to Nazi Brown shirts. The republicans didn't make a stink about it then...nor did any of the Pro-Jewish groups out there (like the Anti-Defamation League) make a peep.  But when you suggest that some of the Bush tactics are similar to how the Nazi party took utter control (not even directly comparing Bush to Hitler) of Germany in the 30's. Well that can't happen. Fox news jumps all over it, the anti-defamation league comes out in droves and says that you can't say something so insensitive, CNN who is not all that right leaning even makes a fuss out of it...then there is something wrong.  You can actually trace or compare some of Bush's policies and laws passed under and by Bush very aptly and evenly to laws that were passed under the Nazi party.  Some of the first things to go under the Nazi party and the Communists were basically the right of dissent. Our right to speak out against our leaders without fear of being called un-patriotic or the fear of being jailed (we are not at the point of jailing dissenters here yet...but under some of the laws that have been passed it is legally possible for the president to jail a dissenter without so much as a trial by going to the extreme with the laws...again it hasn't happened that we know of yet...but it is possible.).  The laws include the Patriot Act, the Security Enhancement Act of 2002, and the soon to be introduced (although it probably will die) Patriot 2. Under the extremes of these laws you can be detained without cause, without access to an attorney, access to a judge, placed in isolation, your family will not be notified that you have been arrested (you disappear), called an Enemy Combatant (which the president declares...no court or jury...but the president has lone discretion a huge violation of the tenants that not one man can imprison another without a jury or consensus of people...making GW a pseudo-dictator), then after being declared an Enemy combatant you can have your citizenship revoked (regardless if you are a natural born citizen or immigrant), and ultimately with the Security Enhancement Act you can be brought before a secret court (again without a lawyer) and found guilty and then sentenced to death...all this and you have no legal recourse at all.  Now that is the extreme of how the laws can be used. Has it happened? No. Is it likely happening...probably not? Is it possible and could it be hidden...yes yes and yes...it may never be applied in such a manor but that doesn't really matter because the law is there and it can be used.  Those laws are similar to how the Communists purged dissenters; how the Nazi's took control of the government...not that the policies or aims are that same...it is the tactics that are the same.  If some Bush monkey saw this they would accuse me of comparing Bush to Hitler or to the Nazi's, or to Stalin...sure we don't have death camps burping out the gasses of the burned corpses in their furnaces out onto the landscape.  So to those who say it is wrong to question, to take to task something you don't agree with, to openly dissent...then you need to read a history book because you are committing a crime. You are repeating history...a history that many better men than yourselves gave their life for.  One thing that we can say...and it is pretty clear is that the United States in collusion with Israel is committing mass crimes against Muslims. I am not on the Muslim side...they have some crazies over there...but we also have our own. By us declaring war on Terrorism we are actually declaring a holy war on Muslims...perhaps a Jihad against them.  I have heard over and over again that it is the Muslims doing the suicide bombings and killing each other as well as our troops or Israeli citizens.  I think if we were to step back and ask this simple question....why are they doing it, what drives them to want to kill themselves to kill us. There is a reason because it is not in human nature to willingly without great cause put us in harms way like that. Something has to be happening so bad in their world that drives them to do that. What is it and can we help stop it?  Instead we have stated that they are "evil" and go off and kill them wholesale. We are committing crimes against humanity. We have to be held accountable sooner or later.  We just need to withdrawal from the world as a military power because we have not used it responsibly and instead abused the power for far too long.  By withdrawing from the world stage militarily and instead engaging them through diplomatic means and just accepting that we will not always get what we want is the only way forward. Right now our military is the primary diplomatic arm or hand that we are presenting to the world. That isn't a safe or wise way to get things done.  There is a lot to do. There is a lot we can do. There is a lot that we must change. We won't be weakened by pulling our military back to a true defensive posture, we won't be seen as weak if we negotiate with other nations, instead we will be seen as strong and confident able to stand on merit and not on military might.  When you have to use the military to push your foreign policy then your policy or diplomacy has failed. Once it has failed then we have failed, and when we have failed then the nation falters.  We can no longer afford to fail on the international diplomacy field. We can only start to win again if we make a move back to diplomacy and international co-operation. We cannot survive without it.

      By the way I love moveon.org and their commercial. I actually gave 20 bucks to help run it. That is the first political contribution I have ever given in cash...I have volunteered before...but now I have given money.  Go see it if you haven't already...it really is powerful and true.

      I am downloading a video of Noam Chomsky called "Manufacturing Consent". I don't know how he would feel about that seeing that I will essentially be getting the work for free and I would be glad to send him money for the video...  That is my major dilema anymore with downloading things off the internet. I don't want to buy music from Record Stores or record clubs...not because I don't want to see the musician paid...but because I don't want to see the record company paid...simple as that.  So when I have to have a CD...I will try and download it and send a check to the artist or musician directly if possible, or I go up to my local record store where they sell used CDs.  So there it is...I would love to send Mr. Chomsky money for his work and I may well just do that.

      Well he finished.  I'm scared...we are in trouble. When will the Democrats challenge him...when will they openly "boo!" him. Why aren't we doing that?  The president's path that he has laid out is one of destruction. Partiot renewal, the call for making his tax cuts permanent, calling for a possible constitutional ban on gay marriage...all of this is wrong.  Never seeking a permision slip to defend America...um well we can't go it alone. Rome, France, Germany, England, the Greeks, Egytpians, and numerous other states or world powers have tried to go it alone with little or no co-operation have always failed and fallen into ruin.  Bush just laid out...the path to ruin. We go forward on anyone of his plans and guess what...we will fail.

      It is telling when you look at your president and you only see the empty face of evil staring back at you. His eyes filled with hate, his brow furrowed with lies, his mouth moving telling me why. He tells nothing but lies.  Soon he will be gone...one way or another...he will be gone.

      Tonight is the state of the union speech. It will be interesting to hear what whoppers he tells tonight. I am sure there will be some great points to work with.  One thing that I have heard that he wants to do and I actually agree with is removing the down payment requirements on FHA financing for houses. It is about time...the down payments have always been the most difficult thing for many to get together. While FHA financing has always had a low down payment percentage it has always still been difficult and the main obstacle for people trying to buy a home. So that I agree with and maybe at some point soon if I ever get well enough I may even be able to afford a house of my own.   However the rest of what has been hinted at is just plain bad. Bush wants to extend health care out to more people but it will most likely be another weakening of Medicare and Medicaid with huge handouts to the drug and insurance companies.  We all have to keep our eyes and ears open and listen for those buzzwords...because the speech will be packed with them.   It is going to be interesting and I am sure I will have something to say about it all. We shall see.  I just hope Dean doesn't stumble anymore...because he really is a better candidate than the rest (except Kucinich) and would at least be able to take it to Bush and hold him accountable for what he has done.

      Well I had to think about Dean's performance last night when he was giving his speech after he came in third. After having thought about it I have to say I was a taken by surprise. I know he is angry, I just didn't know he was mad.   I understand exactly where he was coming from...and frankly I have made the same noises and expressed the same frustration many times over. Until now being angry was the right thing but now he needs to shift from sheer madness to a little bit softer approach. He can still be mad, indignant, and pugnacious, but he can no longer run on just anger (because we see Edwards and Kerry moving forward because of their "nice guy" persona). It just needs some tweaking and he will be in good shape.  The performance was just over the edge last night. I understand the grunt and the "wraaarrr!" feeling because I do the same thing when frustrated and angry (its a better responce than just punching a random wall or person).  It was just over the top and I feel that he may have to pay a little on that for a while...but I am sure of my candidate. I still support him...and in the end I feel that he will come out on top.  The rest of the field (except Kucinich) are just DINO's...they haven't stood up to the Republicans and have been in colusion with them...  We need our country back.

      We have the State of The Union Coming up tonight...that will be fun to watch what the Boy King will call for...I can only imagine.  Permanent Tax Cuts, War is Good, We Are Safe, 9/11, 9/11, Patriot, Saddam a bad man, "Naaaahhh guunnnaaa do itttt", "its baad, itsss badddd", and probably the inevitable outlining of the new "Axis of Evil" that will include Iran, Zimbabwe, and France..cause you know them Frenchies are giving the starving children so anthrax tampons to lob at the Iranians who will then retaliate against Bush's butt buddy Sharon (that crazy little fat jew...really look at him...he is as wide as he is tall...reminds me of Violet in Willy Wonka...and yes he is a jew...not meant to be derogatory in this sense...although he is also that way as well). Then we be releasin a rocket...from out da pocket...oh yeah heh ho heh ho!  This is all nuts...its all upside. All we can see is GW moonin' us as he pockets the wealth of the nation. If we don't vote someone else in...then we damn well deserve it (well we don't and those of us who don't vote for him should be allowed to make our own little better nation). I just wish more people could see through all the Bullshit on both sides of the fence...  I would characterize what we have now as this. The Republican Side that is nothing but death and destruction...it is then seperated by a middle ground that is lush and lively, and then another fence with the Democrats on the other side...and guess what it looks the same...but it has been painted green. The middle ground is where most on either sides of the fences want to get too...it is beautiful and peaceful and healthy, but unfortunately these fences are much more secure than any other fence in time...as it has held us all collectively back...and kept us from that dream.  Both sides have fences...and neither fence is a good choice...but at least right now the Dems side of the fence won't kill you in a few years...it will take many years to bleed you dry...the republicans shoot on site just like they would like to do on the US/Mexico border.  Bahh...bed time.

      Kerry got the nod of the Iowa Caucus...big deal.   I will say now that regardless of who gets the nod (unless it is Lieberman) I will vote for them. I just think that it is kind of odd that the majority of people in Iowa are against the war in Iraq yet the essentially said they were for a man who voted for the war.  At least they didn't go with Gephardt...he was co-sponsor of the Iraq War Legislation Bill...so at least they were somewhat awake.  What is surprising is that Kucinich would have his voters caucus for Edwards in the end if Kucinich didn't look like he would get any delegates.   Edwards placed second...and I can't figure out why. He is affiable and he is nice...he is Clinton Lite...reminds me of him. Clinton was great in his period...he is no longer relevant to the party and anyone who would willingly follow him down his meandering pathway of life is just plain foolish.  The Democrats need to take back their party from the DLC...and Edwards is a high ranking member of the DLC.  Kerry talkin about special interests is also kind of funny.  Dean has the only "clean" money so far (and it is pretty much assured that later the money may get a little dirtier but at least the seed was planted with small donations and not 2000 a plate dinners).  The only reservation that I would have with Dean v Bush is this very plain thing. Dean is much smarter than Bush. The powers that be have been grooming Bush lately to be this kind of lovable frat boy oaf that people kinda feel bad for when he is picked on (although they should just go all out and give him some foam headgear and some novacaine so he drools on command0...and when Dean would "debate" Bush, Dean would look like a meanie to our poor little boy king. That is the only thing that may be worrisome...because Dean would literally run Bush over on a debate of anything. Dean thinks fast and talks fast...and when he shoots from the hip he at least has the right target in site (unlike Bush who fires off half cocked like the pre-mature ejaculator that he must be).  When it comes down to it...Bush has got to go...no matter how it is done...whether it be through us voting him out, kicking him out, or just plain getting rid of him...I say we throw our best pretzels at the problem...because apparently that snack food has it out for him.  Ok Kerry...enough...you won. There...Heinz money will only go so far...and you did vote for the war. You and the others from Washington (except Kucinich) all cowed to Bush and the Republicans on every major issue. You voted for his policies, you supported his resolutions, you helped put the country on the fast track to hell...the only clean ones out of the bunch are Dean and Kucinich.  People are blind.

      Well I got the laptop all fixed up and ready to rumble...well as ready as I am ready for it too...now I just need to head out and warchalk and find me some places to connect up to wirelessly.   I have changed the look a little around on it so it resembles something that I like...the laptop is sleek so I made the interface a little slicker as well.  I am downloading Real Player so that I can watch my show in a bit Democracy Now!  Lately I have slacked off on my postings around the internet at all the normal haunts...and I have a pretty good reason. I am not feeling to well at all.   Today the doc came in and told me I would be here for a while and not to look forward to heading anywhere until they figure out what is actually wrong...which they don't know at all. They have me on all the right stuff but I am not getting any better I am getting worse for some reason.  On top of everything else I got a nice sinus infection...it took a couple of days to hit me...I know where I got it from. It sucks ass...  Hopefully over the next few days I will be back to fighting shape...I am probably going to spend a lot of time sleeping over the next couple of days which will be nice :-)  If there is anything that really catches my eye as always I will report. They have a couple of really good reads over at  CommonDreams.  Go give em a look...you might learn something.  It seems that my comments have gone away again...who know I will try and get that fixed soon.  Peace.

      Ok...so I got Jesse off yesterday...luck bro...that box is mad fast.  I also got my laptop re-installed with XP Pro...and it is crispy sweet now...I am just waiting on my wireless router/hub.  I will be looking forward to that.  Got some bad news from the doctor today. There is no end in sight for me. He is completely baffled as to why I am not responding but instead getting worse. So he will keep me until he figures it all out.  I imagine that I will be here a month soon....who knows but this is a hell of a stay.  Well I am very very tired and extremely overspent on my energies...so I am going to take a nap.  Peace

      Oh yeah I feel like shit...also got all of Jesse's box put together overnight here...now I just need software to load onto it...got the wrong stuff here...so I will have to have my mom bring the right stuff...  I also need a couple of cables that I don't have here...but I have them at home....  It should only take me a few hours to get all the software installed and I will be able to let the little bird fly away...far far away.  The parts we got are primo and they all appear to be working...I just need to get the software fixed so it will actually do something other than sit there like a lump of silicon and plastic.  Once I get his boxes done I will sleep for a while and then I will work on my systems. I am going to install XP Corporate Pro on this laptop (it has XP Home installed)...and my main box can stand a refresh...so I will do it as well. It will give me something to do over the next few days...keep me pre-occupied.  I ordered a wireless router/hub yesterday so that I could use this laptop wirelessly here and at home. I will need to get GM a wireless card...but that won't be expensive...I dunno exactly what I will do yet...but I am looking forward to having this thing wireless...especially when they get my port turned on in here...cause then I can walk around and compute...w00t! Oh yeah and I got that wireless and 4 port hub/router for 29 bucks...oh yeah gotta love rebates :-)  Oh yeah...try and catch on CNN Presents on Muslim Radicalism and that whole story. It was very well done. A lady from Singapore (where the real war on Islam is...) said that the rhetoric from both sides is from the pulpit...Bush is a fundamentalist just as Osama is...which if you were to take just the words of the speeches they each give and compared them without face or voice...they are the same. Both preaching radical views of the world and casting people as good or evil.  It is really interesting.  I just hope this year we will change and get back on track. There is to much at stake now...and we can't afford to be wrong (we can afford to loose, but not wrong).  23 people so far dead...but that is a low number.

      Well another day another mass bombing in the middle east.  When will we say "enough is enough...get our troops out of there"?  I understand that if we leave now it will fall into chaos and many more people will die and we would possibly have to face an even uglier government there than what was in Saddam's government.  I just don't even know people...it is just so bad and so many people here are absolutely oblivious to how bad things are getting over there...all we hear is "ra ra...the economy is going good, the war on terrorism is going well, we are winning in Iraq"...when in reality there is nothing of the sort.  The economy is in the shitter...sure the stock market is rising and corporate profits are rising...because they have been firing people and forcing their workers into longer harder hours...that is how productivity goes up.  The stock market isn't real money...remember that folks...you are basically saying when you buy stock...I bet this company will be around in a few years and making money...nothing more. It isn't real. The stock that you own entitles you to nothing (even less than what a dollar bill is worth) if the company goes belly up its not like if you have 50,000 shares and you trade it in for a colour copier from the office...its not real.  Of coarse stocks are rising...because taxes on corporations is low and over the past few years companies have fired people left and right and have been able to drive their current employees into doing more work...again not real...  Terrorism...ok if you haven't figured it out by now...than go ahead and get some duct tape and tape yourself up and suffocate...do us all a favor. We are still in yellow...or orange...whatever...but we aren't any safer now than a few years back (and any monkey with some maps and a few numbers could make the point that we are less safe).  Iraq...again...if you think things are going well then I got a bridge to sell you along with some nice real-estate out in this little swamp. It is all a mess and we know it...but we are going to go on and pretend (as we did in Vietnam) that we can make it better...we all know how that turned out.  We are in the middle of a crisis right now. We have cast ourselves as the "good guys" and those who aren't with us as the "evildoers"...problem is there are a hell of a lot more of them than us...and if majority rules (as we like to say with our democracy) then we are not the good guys.  We just don't know...and frankly I am getting confused at who is who...because I can see it from both sides...and neither is right or wrong.  What it all ends up coming down to is who's imaginary friend is bigger than the others.  I think we need to grow up a little and realize that even if we have an imaginary friend...I don't think it wants us going around killing each other over it...so harvey...I let you go...hop through the forrest.

      Here is something for all you folks out there that like to think. Read it...good points and certainly illegal. Hmmmm...   Not just illegal but unconstitutional...    Commondreams.org  is a great wearhouse of information. They basically have people all over read what is being printed in the news media and then they compile it into one big news edition. Things do get reported but usually it is under-reported or put so far back in a paper that no one really sees the stories and they rarely get airplay or discussion.  I read it everyday just to keep up. It is like having many different newspapers at my disposal at anyone time. They sometimes ask for money and I have considered giving a few bucks over because the service is so worth it.   Anyways...make it a daily read and I bet you will become informed very quickly of how little you actually hear and know...and then think of all the news that we still don't get even through these non-mainstream sources...it is very similar to a method that Chomsky uses to gather data...it is out there...but in tidbits and such. He and his coleagues swap folders of clippings back and forth and then weave together the news as it really is.  Good way to learn...you have to learn to learn.

      Well there have been some shakeups over in Dean country...  Joe Trippi has left the campaign...I just hope this doesn't hurt to much. He is credited with the movement but not the poll numbers. He most certainly organized the overall movement but so far from what I have seen that doesn't always translate into votes in the vote box.   It is sad to see him go...but maybe we can refocus and move forward.  The only thing that I have a little bit of a problem with is that the campaign may be having money problems. Now we all pretty much understand that running a campaign is expensive but my question is 40million already spent? I dunno...but that is a lot of money to go so fast.  Well I donated regardless...and I think he is the best man for the job.

      Well I gave to Dean today. I really feel like he is the best candidate out there. I was only able to give 25 bucks...but it is better than nothing at all.  I would be updating more frequently like in the beginning but with all the drugs they have me on right now I am barely able to read the screen and corolate what is being typed to what my fingers are doing...it is very strange and very frustrating.  Looks like Shrub and his little patches of weeds are about to have to ride through a Briar patch with this whole David Kay "there were no WMD's before we went in"...Now let me get this straight Bush is calling for more time to let the inspectors do their job and find them all...but when it was the UN he wanted to get them ouit of there as fast as possible so he could ride to battle.  Time is ok for us but not for the UN? Whathefuck!  Oh yeah and the 9/11 commission has now said it will need a couple of extra months to complete its work as the original deadline is in May...they need until July or something like that. The Republican "leadership" in the house, senate, and white house have all said that they won't get more time.  The claim is that they have had enough time and we should prepare to move on...well tell it to Mr. Shrub when almost everyone of his major speeches includes references to 9/11 and the "Evil Doers".  The whole "they have had plenty of time" thing is really moot because the Administration has drug its feet in coming forward with any documentation about 9/11. Basically the Administration is at least hiding something...what it is we don't know...but they are hiding something...and because they drug their feet they ran out the shot clock leaving the people without answers.  We just all need to step back and take a good look at the situation...once you do if you are not enraged at the sheer volume of lies and well just plain lies.  They are lieing to us...they have been and are continuing too.  It is time for us to rise up and take it all back...this is horrible. If I could make sweeping changes right this minute I would make such sweeping changes and so many people would be hanging from the Gallows...we need to hold our "leaders" accountable and string them up.  It all makes me sick.

I am glad the first primarey is done...but you know Joe will continue...he just needs to step down. This is all rediculous.  You have Kerry, Dean, and maybe Clark/Edwards...  Well it is getting close...and unfortunately none of them up there in the bottom of the pack is realizing that they would be better served if they quite and support another candidate...but some of them (Joe) are dillusional...and to say Kerry is the comeback kid is misleading...  Also it will be 200,000 plus that showed up...that is a tribute to Dean....got huge numbers...and he is sitting pretty....  Here's Howard...

      Today I got a little sleep finally and they have bumped up my meds so I am mostly numb. My blood sugar is way out of whack...my lungs hurt (and are bleeding right now cause I can taste it in my breath)...and I am just worn down. Hopefully I will have full internet access tomorrow.  My mom brought the speakers I got out of the deal for building Jesse's computer. They are the Logitech Z-680 set and they are jizzmistical. I have it all set up on one cart with the laptop and then the speakers and the sub setting on the railing under the cart. The whole set is just primo. I got a few pics of it...and I will get them posted soon.  I also got it tweeked out so it is running smooth. The only things that I really want to get it an SB Extagy and maybe a pocket pc...I found a great one for 199 with a little camera built in running on Pocket PC 2003...it would be an interesting toy...but I don't need anything like that right now...although the Extagy would come in handy.  So we will see what the techno gods have in store for me.  looking out my window I see a beautiful site...snow everywhere. I love it...  With the big speakers, fast laptop, and all the other things I have around here...I am almost like at home here.  Tomorrow I may have something important to say...who knows...but right now I have no fight in me...  Peace

      Watchin Seabiscuit with my nurse Ammie...she had to step out for a minute but will be back...getting used to this whole hospital family thing...it is nice to be in a place that is like home where the people treat you well and understand that you don't always feel good and can let when you get a little mean just roll of their backs...  That is always the thing that I get the most worried about is that I am mean or snippy...I worry with it in my daily life because I want to be as good as I can. I don't like to treat people like shit...I just don't. I try to be as nice as possible because hey you never know when you will need that person that you are treating like shit.   I don't like being in the hospital as far as it is a hospital...but I am getting a little used to it because it is nice that I don't have to go get things. Everything is just brought to me...and that is K-Rad...  Well I have some reading to do and I am going to watch 2Fast 2Furious...its a suck ass movie...but I have only seen it once...so I need to watch it again.  Peace out homeskillets...  Oh yeah I might have to back off my utter disgust and hatred of Barbera Streisand...she is evil...mecha-streisand...only because she is a Dean supporter...so in her black heart there is something that resembles life...so I no longer hate her outright (I don't know why I hate her...it is just this knee jerk irrational feeling I have towards her...she just makes me wanna toss my cookies...but I can swallow the hate to be on the same side...and if you all only knew how hard it is to just even think about her for me...then you would get it)...

      Well lemme start out by saying that I love this laptop...it is very jizz.  Today however has been a pretty shitty day over all. First I woke up to my mouth getting sores and stuff making it hurt like a son of a bitch. Really it is a pain in the mouth. However I figured out what drug is causing it and it is Cipro...one of the many possible side effects are mouth sores which I have an abundance of.  Well the power just went out here at the hospital...very strange indeed...glad I am on a lapop and can limp through it...also glad that my entire setup is a laptop and can survive without wall juice.   I may post later..who knows....

      Ok so the network access that the hospital was supposed to provide isn't really network access after all. It is an extra phone line for Dial-Up access to the outside.  Now don't get me wrong...wow, gee, um thanks for the extra phone line, really I need an extra one. I already have one to the oustide world and it costs 7 bucks a day regardless if I use it or not...I don't and haven't had a dial-up account in over 2 years now and wouldn't consider even bothering to pick up a small account for even 10 bucks a month just to have access at the hospital for a land line instead of wireless line to SprintPCS.  Again it isn't what they gave out that was the problem it was how they came to the decision and how long it took them to make the decision that cheeses me off. It took them all this time to figure it out what they were going to offer and then come in and bodly anounce it like they had just created fire.  Why they didn't give us just a port into the system is because of security. Ok...security. I understand that...security is security and this is a hospital...they want to make sure that their system is secure. However without any passwords how do you get it? Before the move they had computer labs open to people...really anyone who wandered in. To get onto their archaic network system to get records or x-rays and such you have to navigate through a program that looks like it was made by a four year old and have the proper access codes and passwords...and it doesn't even work most of the time. You could still go to the internet or use their pipes out to the internet...it was filtered of coarse but it wasn't filtered totaly out.  Now I know I am making a mountain out of a molehill but when you are told that you are going to have network access you would think that you indeed would have network access. So...  What I am going to do is there is a Starbucks across the street...I need to find out their range....if it is enough I may try and get some access through them...but I still have Cell Phone Access so I can use that...but hey I wanted network access.  I also have a wireless router here and I may bridge the connection so that if Danielle has wifi on her Sony laptop...which I think she has...because Sony has always been ahead of the pack on connectivity features...if she has WiFi then she is more than welcome to share the 115Kbps connection I have...and when she heads online I'll have her dial-up also bridged and if both setups are on than we will have combined about 178Kbps or so....it won't be the fastest in the world but we can make it work I am sure.  If I can get a good connection to Starbucks (which we have one close by...and maybe I can get their wireless network) then I will definitely share the connection.  I am also half contemplating hacking the network and putting my access point out there and just going online...who knows...  I am just pissed off about it all because they could make guest accounts that limit us to just internet access and not access to other network resources, they could do it the right way in the first place and have real security in place...there are so many things they could do and make it all work easily for us and them...but instead of actually doing something about it they just said it can't be done and moved on.  Oh well...my kung fu is strong.

      Ok just because I am nice doesn't mean I actually like you...I don't think this respiratory guy gets it. He is new and slow...and I helped train him yesterday and was showing him some tricks and stuff to make it easier.  Well he is back again today and I tell you just won't shut up, won't leave...I was sitting here eating and he watched me for ten minutes until I told him that I was eating and wasn't ready for a treatment...he went away for a few minutes then came back and stared at me some more doing that "retard lick lips thing"...and mouth breathing...oh hes back and wandering around...well I went to close my laptop when he came over...I think he gets the message...if I need him then I will call for him...you don't need to hear what is going on in my lungs...it hasn't changed from about five minutes ago dipshit.  Sometimes I worry for humanity....actually I worry a lot about humans...I think we are already extinct and we just haven't realized it yet. The planet will be rid of us soon...and it will be better for it.  I just wish we could outlaw stupid people...that would make the world a better place. Ban them, oulaw the breeding of mentally inferior kids (im not talking retards here...I am taking those kids who walk into walls and are too dumb or lazy to just go to the damn bathroom before squeezing out a fat turd in their underoos and that kid happens to be 30 years old...)  I guess I am just in a fould mood today.

      Ok...so the big Half Time shocker was apparently that Justine Timberlake expose Janet Jackson's tittie...ok no biggie...it wasn't a close up shot...but it looks like she might have some nice titties and it looked pierced...  Fuck the FCC....fuck fuck fuck the FCC and those republican prudes...hehehehe...betcha ol GW Shrub has seen a few of his servants titties in his days around...hell he probably had a black wet nurse.  Although no self respecting black woman would ever nurse him or any of his racist evil clan...you know they ran with the Nazi's back in the day...Shrub's grandaddy had his bank taken away from him by the Government because it was doing business (and a good one too) with Nazi Germany and making money off of slave labour in some of the death camps...  Well at least that is what history has told us.

      This week has been probably one of the more bizarre weeks in a while.  Lets see if we can hit the major points.  David Kay the chief US weapons inspector quit his job and has said that we were all wrong in our assumptions on Weapons of Mass Destruction. At the beginning he was convinced that Iraq had massive stockpiles and now he sais there aren't any at all.  Cheney still believes in them being there. Bush has thought maybe they weren't there but we still have to give the US weapons inspectors more time (didn't he argue against that when it was the UN?) before we would know the truth.  Cheney may still yet be prosecuted in France in a bribery charge against his company Halliburton. Cheney also has had a good hunting trip with Supreme Court Justice Scalia, who if you recall is hearing the case brought by some groups (Sierra Club for one) to open up who came to the Secret Energy Meetings that Cheney had. Scalia has refused to recuse himself from the case almost assuring whatever the outcome (especially if the court keeps the meetings information closed to the groups) look fishy.  Bush appointed Pickering...the supposed racist Judge from MS (which he isn't...but nonetheless shouldn't be appointed any higher because he holds views that are for me to far to the right). He backdoor appointed him and now the Dems have to figure out what to do.  The Democratic ticket is all screwed up.  Dean has had some shakeups in his camp. First Trippi is gone...Trippi the main man behind the orginization of the Internet portion of the Dean Machine. Obviously in the Iowa Caucus we lost pretty badly overall, Gephardt dropped out then because he just wasn't getting the vote. Dean then had his scream...which anybody who has actually enhabited the what many of us refer to as "the real world" (not MTv Style...and condolences to the MTv family over the loss of Bennam or whatever her name is who was one of the creators and producers of "The Real World" series on MTv she died from a a cancer that she has suffered with for many years). You see out in the "real world" there are these things called emotions and even the most rational of us suffer from them.  He was venting his anger, passion, revving up the troops, getting attention, and yes howling...so what? Who cares? At least he is literate unlike Bush and hasn't nearly been taken out by a pretzel eating mishap.  Dean went on and lost NH...he came in second to Kerry. He showed very well and really he didn't loose share to Kerry instead Kerry just picked up people that came into the voting process and was able to turn out his base at the poles.  Now Dean looks like he will come in Second or Third in the upcoming Tuesday primaries.  Now he had arounr 40 some odd million...or raised that much. Now he is down to 5 million or thereabouts. Most of his staff will have to give up a few weeks pay and he has had to pull all ads from TV for the time being to conserve funds.   My only question outside of who he replaced Trippi with is how did they blow through that money so fast? That is probably the biggest shocker right there...The only thing is that he was running ads much earlier than competitors and running ads in states that aren't even close to primary. I understand why he did...really it is marketing 101...but unfortunately marketing 202 is where they teach you how to spend wisely and better target your ads.  He is still raising money...so that is good. Dean still has pull with his core...but his core is tiring because we have spent much time (or at least I have spent a great deal explaining the good and bad...trying to be balanced instead of "ra-ra-ra" about him and all) explaining what is going on and trying to put a good spin on things.  It is no secret that the media has it out for Dean. They bash at every opportunity and it is almost sickening to watch Crossfire and watch the left come out to attack him. They have replayed that damn clip to death and never give up the chance to take a cheap shot at him.  Kerry has moved into the head slot for campaigning...but if you look behind the scenes you see nothing. Kerry has less Deligates devoted to the primary than Dean (Dean has something like 113 Kerry 98 or so...Dean is still on top). His policy chest is empty...he took Deans talking points and shamelessly plagarized them and makes himself out to be anti-special interest even though he has recieved the most money out of all the people running in special interest money for senators over the past 15 years...so that is baseless...he can be bought.  Kerry looks good...he looks electable. Well he isn't as electable and I will try and tell you why. Look at his voting record over this past three years and pick a random republican senator. Guess what they voted almost the same down the board. So there is no difference between him and the republicans at large.  The only reason Kerry is 1 right now is simply because he is a better politician right now. He has been able to ride a wave but soon that wave will crash.  Dean has a problem there too. Roy Neel...the new co-ordinator was a lobbyist. He was Gore's manager as well. However Dean is an outsider and frankly it is bold enough to work...but it is so far out there that it may crash and burn.  If this all works the system may well just be changed...and we may well get our government back...I can say one thing though is that even if Dean doesn't win (oh please we need a moderate in the white house not another cowboy) the system will have to change to accomodate us. They may be able to placate us for a while...but eventually we will win.   This particular election cycle is pretty unique because of all the outside Dynamics coming into play this time around. We have all been forced to look at what is going on. While many people see it one way as being great...about 98% of the rest of the world looks at it and sees a mess. So I think just shear dynamics is going to change things.  Ok now this post was rambling and not very well written...and frankly I am ashamed of it...but I had about an hour of a clear head.  I am on  50mg of Benadryl every four hours. 40mg Oxyconton every 12 hours 500mg (5/250*2) Percocet every four hours. (10mg effective oxycodone) 2mg Dilaudid every five hours.  So I am pretty doped up almost all the time. I love drugs...but damn...  The dilaudid isn't the best out there...although it is powerfull...for me it lasts around 2 hours and then the pain is back. The percocets last longer on me...and oxycontin doesn't matter much...it just is longer lasting...you don't get dopey fast off of it....  Well it is late and I need to have them bring me some percocets for these hips and knees....they do hurt...not to mention that my chest hurts from almost constant coughing. That sucks....  Well whenever I get a clear head I will write again I am sure...  Peace....

      It has been a few days...and I am starting to jonez for my laptop...eesh I wish it was finished already.  I did finally get my new toy...got it at a steal...you can't beat getting a top of the line (of yesterday...or rather a year old design) Pocket PC 2002 for around a 100 bucks. The thing has a 400Mhz processor, 4" screen, both a SD and CF slot...I just ordered a 256MB memory card for the SD and an 802.11B card for the CF slot...not to mention I also have a 128MB and two 16MB cards for the CF slot...this little thing is damn fine. It also has a unique capability in that you can get a patch type cable and plug USB devices directly into it...so it is concievable to plug my cell phone in using the USB cable, whipping up a quick set of drivers for PPC2002 and then surf the net from my handheld.  I had been planning on getting one for a while...and since this was such a deal I didn't want to pass it by...really I couldn't. Hell its even a Toshiba (made by Audiovox)...  Anyways...as soon as I get my laptop back I will be online to give all the details of what has happened for the past few days.  Peace

Without laptop I have no phone...and that sucks ass as well...my phone charges off the laptop...and my home charger that I brought with me was destroyed in one of the moves about...  Well I will have a better update at some point....damn laptops and their funky keyboards...also this was a floor model PC...so it was banged on pretty good....

      Sorry Jess that I didn't call...Today was a huge setback day...and I mean huge!  I had gotten home from running GM to Monroeville so that we could get a rain check filled on 100 blank DVD+R's (got all the discounts! So the hundred only cost with tax 42 bucks and some change!)...We ate and then I dropped her off here at the house...Took a few digital pics for her and went to have them delivered and to get a replacement wireless card for GM's computer (because the other one wasn't working properly)...Well I then just putzed around for a while because it was a nice day.  I ended up at my local pharmacy to pick up some benadryl and then something happened. I started coughing in the pharmacy...No biggie I walked a half a block and I was out of breath...I got outside and couldn't stop and I was bringing shit up so I spit it out...  Well what I spit out was not phlegm or mucus...It was pure blood. I kept coughing up blood and more blood...It wasn't like mucus and blood...This was all straight blood...and it would stop.  I got to my car and spent almost five minutes coughing up a lot of blood...I coughed up maybe a cup or cup and a half of blood. There is blood on my steering wheel, on my door...on some CDs...all over the friggin place. I was finally able to get a little handle on it and headed home...I live only four blocks from the pharmacy...I had to stop four times to cough up and spit out several mouthful of blood...It really scared me...What scared me most was I could feel where the burst had occurred...and I could here it gurgling as it was filling that bit of space with blood. It was the most scary thing that I have gone through so far....and it terrified me...  The end result is that I am now short of breath...A tad weak...and scared that this is gonna happen again tonight while I sleep...Because I didn't do anything to trigger the lungs like that and make them bleed.  Well that was my day...oh yeah and my grandmothers computer is fighting me...up, down, left, and right...it just doesn't want to go wireless...so I put an ethernet card in it...moved the modem and router/access point down here to the first floor and I will install the wireless card in my box...I am sure it will behave.  While I was exchanging the bad USB Wireless 802.11b adapter that I had previously tried I was able to get 802.11g gear for the same price (and they are internal cards...I got two at I think 39 bucks a piece...that is if I send the rebate in for 20 bucks on each). I also ordered up 2 Logitech Webcam NX's and they will be 19.99 after I send in the rebates, and the crown jewel was that I got an 802.11g Router Access point for 59 bucks (again with a rebate)...I was able to get a balls out fast wireless system for not a lot of dough...and what is nice is that 802.11g is backwards compatible with 802.11b so my Centrino setup will still be good and my 802.11b card for my Pocket PC is also still good!  Got great deals...then got slammed with a bleeding lung...damn you sweet irony!  Peace

      Oh yeah...I am glad that the Mayor of San Francisco has ordered his city to allow Gay Marriage. It is very brave of him and I commend him on it.  To take the point that he made for it...Let me repeat it. At one point interracial marriages were prohibited all across the country. Now most people don't make a big fuss over it. So to take the step and allowing gays to marry is great and a bold step forward.  Kudos out to the mayor...

      Well I would have given a lot of updates today had I not been in all sorts of pain.  I got a prescription for Oxycontin but my doc wrote it for a non-existant dosage so the pharmisist had to get a different prescription for a proper dosage...and that took until earlier today.   So once I got the meds I was ok...I had to take one additional pill over what I should have taken just to get the levels back up. Now I am on a regular schedule of 40mg every eight hours. Not to shabby.  I am of coarse dissapointed that Howard Dean has essentially dropped out...but after the race he has run and all the crap that he alone has had to go through with the media and several of the other candidates (with the exception of Edwards, Braun, and Kucinich)...I am still a Dean supporter and will carry on with the ideas...but now I will be throwing my vote towards Edwards. At first I had a little trouble with him...I got a gut feeling and I still have it about him...but I cannot support a candidate (Kerry) who has blatently stolen others platforms...Kerry stole Dean's and now he is trying to steal Edwards.  I call for all Democrats to realize that Kerry is a political oportunist and will jump on any bandwagon whenever it is politically expediant or favorable. Kerry has yet to come out with an original idea. You will see as this grinds on the Kerry is indeed very much like Bush.  However if he does get the nomination I will vote for him. I just hate being put into the position of having to choose the less of two evils.  Well that is all...hopefully I will be able to get those updates for you...and I am sure much will be devoted to politics.  Peace

      Well I finally got my laptop back today...and I got out of the hospital. I at home now writing this on the laptop in my living room...gotta love wireless internet.  Well I have a lot to update people about what has happened over the past two weeks or so since I have been offline.  I will do that in time...so just bear with me.  That is all for now. I am doing a treatment right now and have several to go...then I go upstairs to set up my main box and get it up and running again.  So much to do...so little energy.  Peace

      Well the good news is that I get my laptop back on Wednesday....yay! It turns out I was right about what was wrong...and you doubt me...come on people.  The got the new keyboard in today and got it installed and all should be well. They actually should have sent it out today and if they did and got it out today there is the remote possibility that it will be here tomorrow but it will definetly be in by Wednesday. Also on Wednesday I have the parts that I need for my pocket PC to go wireless that day as well....so it will just be a big ole love fest of hardware and goodies. What is nice is that I got a SD memory card that I can use in both my Pocket PC and my Laptop (it has a SD slot built in)...it is just neat all this technology.  Well a lot has happened over the time that I haven't had real unfettered access to the internet and as soon as I get the laptop back I will most definitely making a rather large update as there is a lot to tell.   There are good things and bad things...but at least there are things.  We have a new CF patient up here on the floor she has come over from Childrens she is a little frightened. I may go visit her tomorrow and see how she is doing seeing that I am the old man on the floor now. There are CF patients left that are sicker than I am...but I am fast rising to the top of the list of the sick ones. I am also now officially the longest inpatient right now here at Shadyside seeing that Danielle is no longer over here....she is now over at Presby...she got her transplant finally...I will tell all about that when I have more time to update properly.  I also have a lot to say about the current political climate and what seems to be almost a given now...the Kerry nomination. I have a lot to say about that....and boy oh boy it will be good to get it off my chest.  Well there isn't much else I want to write about right now...so I will leave it at that...  Remember hopefully by Wednesday you will see a much larger update and a lot of information. I will probably do multiple posts that day as I get one thing tackled after the other.  I also have a lot to do online that day as well...like pay credit card bills and such...plus download to outrageous stuff for my Pocket PC.  Peace...and until then have a happy time......

      Oh yeah and I just took 20mg of Oxycontin...so that should help out soon...  All these pain killers? Yes...all those pain killers...being couped up and sedentary makes things hurt that you never thought you had...plus it helps get rid of the pain of coughing (when you are coughing day in and day out things get sore real fast).  So I wish I didn't need all of it...but at the same time I am thankful that I have it.  Peace

      Well earlier I went downstairs to get some food from the cafeteria and I thought that I wouldn't need any oxygen...well was I wrong or what...by the time I got back up here to my room I my fingers were turning blue and I was definitely feeling like I needed oxygen.  I guess that will be my reality for a while. I am going to have to have O2 on me...that sucks ass.  My energy reserves are so tapped you have no clue out there.  I got to talk to Danielle today and it was so good. She sounded great. Her mouth was going a mile a minute and she never got winded...she is having some minor problems but nothing that is extremely serious. It was just very good to hear from her...plus she has offered to answer the myriad of questions that I have about transplant. Sure I can read the books and I can watch videos, hell even the docs can answer some things...but it isn't first hand experience and the questions that I have can only be answered by someone who has been through it. So I am very greaful that she has offered to answer questions.  Well it is extremely early in the morning and I just had a dose of Benadryl and Dilaudid...so I am fading fast folks...

      Well I know that I should be updating this blog more often but to be honest I just haven't had the energy. I spent most of yesterday in a hazy half sleep state and just not feeling well.   Today so far I have seen two docs...both Indian...now mind you I don't mind foreigners...but I mind when they are trying to tell me something and they have a bare grasp of our language. Plus I don't like dealing with doctors outside of my own because chances are they don't know how to treat CF patients and end up screwing things up.  Well I am already worn out and I think I will take another nap.  Peace

      Well I am back in the hospital again. This time it is because I have had two episodes of coughing up plain good ole blood. There wasn't any type of mucus or gunk...just straight dark dark red (probably from an artery...oh joy) and my oxygen level on room air are down to between 80-85% when I normally run around 95-96% and that is what I was at when I left the hospital last week.  When they first got the pulse ox monitor on me I was all the way down to the high 60s range...so to same I'm sick would ve an understatement.  We will see how this all plaus our...so updates will probably be updating a little more frequent. So hang in there folks...he blog will slowly come back to life.  Peace

      so I haven't been to sleep yet but I have something to say about our favorite serial lier...Ann Coulter (that neo-nazi, neo-con whore wannabe).  You have heard me talk about Max Cleland before. He was a Senator from Georgia and he lost his campaign to a Republican partly because of a massive smear campaign that the Republicans are well known for. They ran an add with him and then pictures of Osama and Hussein. They called him "un-patriotic" for voting against several of Bush's bills that are now proving to be quite troublesome...mainly Iraq, the war on terrorism...  Well Mr. Cleland lost both legs and an arm in Veitnam...now the story goes is that he was being sent out into the field to fix some radio equipment and when he got off his chopper he noticed a grenade on the ground. He thought that it had fallen off of his kit (as had happened many times before...they had a problem falling off of kit) so he reached down to pick it up and it exploded. He lost both legs and an arm. This all happened at Kei San...the worst battle that we fought in Veitnam...many young men died in the battle and Max recieved several high commidations for his work...the incident happened as the battle was winding down and he was flown to a hilltop to establish a radio tower so that the guys in the rear could better communicate with forward positions (although the guys in the rear were being shelled and had a great battle themselves). Needless to say he was in a combat zone....or hot zone.  He came back and became rather succesful despite his obvious disability.  Our beloved whore...wait I mean Ann...well she makes the case that this all happened not in a battle or combat zone but in a relatively safe place and while he was drinking with his buds. She basically said the whole "war hero" thing was a hoax and that he had lost his limbs out of drunken stupidity.  Well the facts tell quite a different story...the military even responded and his commanding officers responded as well.  Here is a link to a better telling of the  story.   I find it absolutely dispicable what this woman has done and I would love to challenge her to a debate and go on TV with her to just humiliate her. I would have no problems whatsoever calling her a lieing whore who doesn't have the foggiest of idea of what is really going on in the world.  It makes me mad that she would question his patriotism...and it all came about because of the recent Democratic push for Bush's national guard records. Yeah those...where the major questions still lay unanswered.  It is about time that liberals and centrists stand up and collectively tell her she is no longer welcome here. She needs to go live on an island somewhere along with all the other conservative hate mongers out there...let them destroy themselves....because I am tired of them raping our nation.  To Ann...you need to get a clue, you need to stop lieing, you need to leave...you are no longer welcome. Anytime you question someones patriotism by attacking them for an accident where a man or woman gave their all in service to the American population you have then become what you hate most. It is time for you to exit stage left and for us to never hear from you again.

      Well today I got some new antenna's for the wireless setup and now all is peachy. It looks like it will be ok now.  My grandpa is in the hospital...he has been having problems with his cental lines that they do his dialysis through. Over the past few days his one decomissioned line started to leak...well today he almost bled out from it. At some point the surgeons that he has seen put a patch on the artery in his arm and that patch blew today and it was spurting blood all over the place...part of the problem is that he has been picking at the wound for months and it has been infected for a long time.  He went into surgery tonight and got that fixed and they had to take veins from his foot to save the arm. When they got the vein out they noticed that it was completely lined with cholesterol and plaque deposits...now normally you only see that close to the heart and in the groin...but this was all the way down at his hand...so he is really in bad shape.  For me today it wasn't so bad...I got out a little bit and it was non-stressful.  Right now I am about to play with my DVD burner and try and copy a movie...one that I already own.  Now that the network is all fixed I will definitely be updating more often and I will get some of the hospital backlog up.  Peace

      Yet another crap day...but at least I got my grandmothers computer up and purring like a kitten.  The wireless setup is really flaky and I don't know why. I have tried so many different things. Every once in a while the AP just craps out and all the cards go looking for a network. The only thing that is good at switching like that is the damn pocket pc setup I have...and it works great!  It won't matter much longer because I have a Netgear 802.11g router/ap on its way and that should clear uo the problem right there.  Tomorrow I have to go to Radio Shack to pick up some raw cat five cable to make a longer one so that I can keep GM's computer hard wired and have the AP at a central location in the house. While I am there I am going to look for better antenna equipment for both the AP and the Reciever cards...they both have dinky 5 cent jobs...that will help out on the signal issues.   Right now my PDA is showing  an almost flawless conection to the AP...while the card that is in my box is showing only about a quarter of the PDA's signal. Not only to mention I have been getting a great "link quality"...so I think I have a bit to do before the system is really fixed up.  Well kids its time for me to try and sleep...ttyl.  BTW: I will get pics of my new laptop and desktop and PDA when I get all settled back in...because I am sure a few of you are wondering what kind of stuff this techno weeny is using...so stay tuned.

      Well Bush has unleashed his first round of re-election ads and so far they are going over worse than a fart in church...actually I would imagine Satan could walk into a Catholic Church and molest some alter boys and people would be less offended at that than Bush's ads.  I have seen them and frankly I am offended not because of the images but because Bush said that he and Cheney would not use 9/11 as a political chess piece. Of course no one believed him at the time but we all hoped that they wouldn't.   Bush is having to use 9/11 because really he has nothing else to run on. The economy is shit, the so called security that was supposed to be provided by the war on terror has turned out to have made us less secure, and to top it all of the Bush administration has nearly demolished our Civil Rights through various laws.  We haven't even gotten to his Tax cuts for the middle class (I didn't know the middle class started at several hundred thousand a year and up).   This administration is the worst in the history of the US. They have almost single handedly destroyed what America is.  Today Martha Stewart was found guilty on all charges. While I agree that she was guilty as hell, I have to say that she is the big white elephant in the system to keep our attention off of Ken Lay and all those people in Enron and even WorldCom (although Bernie Ebers has been charged), Global Crossing...she was a diversion. It disgusts me that a big deal was made out of her crime which in the grand scheme was minor. She profitted all of 60 grand and since the government has decided to go after her the government has actually cost investors millions through prosecution of her...causing greater damage overall than if they had just fined her and suspended something or other.  Today was also the day that John Ashcroft was admitted for severe pain to a hospital. He has something called Pancreatic Gall Stones or something. Painful and not pleasant for sure. I would never wish pain or illness on anyone (unlike Pat Roberts who called for his flock of sheep to pray that some of the Supreme Court Justices to get sick and die)...however maybe after he gets well he will see that his policies and the things he has done have been bad for the Union and maybe he will reverse his stance on some things...however I doubt he will change his tune. I wish him well and a speedy recovery so that the nation can bash his brains in during this election season and send him back to podunk USA where he lost a senators seat to a dead man.  That is all for now....Peace

      Sorry for the lack of updates lately...I just don't feel like posting all that much. I am not well and really I have spent almost this entire stay in the hospital asleep.  I went to meet the surgeon today and it was good that I got that out of the way. It was about time. I don't know how I feel about it all really. I don't want to be in pain and really I don't want to feel like shit. I am basically scared about getting sick and getting to the point where I have to carry oxygen with me and all that crap...as I have to now.  I had to take O2 with me because I am not getting enough from my lungs out of the air...I really don't want to go through this all. I am afraid and I am worried. I can't really talk to my family about it because I don't know how. I don't want to talk to a therapist because I have done that before and it never helped. I don't want medication to feel mentally better because it comes with a lot of side-effects. I just don't know. As for friends...yeah like I have many that I can talk to about this.   Sure I will probably get some email here and they will all be like "dude you can talk to me about anything"...well it isn't that easy and no I can't. There is no way you can understand what I am feeling and what I am going through. Really you can't help and I am not mad about it or do I want to not be friends...it just isn't something that I can talk with them about.  I just don't want to be sick and I certainly don't want to go through all of this.  I guess it is that time that I just have to buckle down and deal...and I hope I can.  Another thing that is bothering me is that I have not had sex in over three years now. So? You say....well it isn't so much the sex or the intimate contact that I miss...it is that piece of the puzzle that you feel needed or wanted if only for a few minutes or hours...that is what I miss. I miss just being loved by someone other than my family and I don't mean "cutesy I love you, I love you", I mean it for real. To feel that connection again would be great. That is probably the biggest fear that I have...I will go through all of this alone and if I make it out the other side what will be there waiting...at this point nothing. On the other side of all of this is nothing...not a family, not a girlfriend or lover...just me.   I wish that I could go out and play the field now...but even if I could I am horrible at it...sure I can be funny and witty...but I need an audience for that to work...one on one sometimes it doesn't relate.  I would just like to know what is in store so I could make a more informed decision for myself instead of walking blindly into the great unkown. If I knew what was up...then I could make a decision and be content with it. Since I don't know or have a clue, making a decision is hard and I am not happy with it because I don't know.  Peace

      I just saw a commercial for Viagra that uses Queen's "We Are The Champions"...now we all know that Freddy Mercury loved a good stiff cock from time to time...but I would think he would have a problem with his song being used in that commercial.  Have they no shame.  heheheheh...stiff cock.

      As we get closer to finalizing Kerry as the Democratic nominee for President, the more I feel like the American Public has lost control of our own government and that we are no longer needed except to rubber stamp things.  I was thinking last night and I came to some interesting ideas and conclusions.  Under this administration we have seen the budget for education slip...While it has grown it has not grown at the pace that is needed to just keep at baseline. With the "No Child Left Behind" act we are seeing that in essence the Federal Government wants to get out of the Education Business because after all if your school or district is failing then you first get put on a probation of sorts then if (which reduces Federal Funding...When it should increase to fix the problems) your district or school continues to not meet the standard then you will loose all Federal Funding.  That is a classic case of breaking an already broken system. If you cut funding to a struggling school then obviously it won't have the resources to better itself and will continue to fail.  Now what happens...Well your child is left without many alternatives...While I won't say that public schools will go the way of the Dodo but I will say that the public schools will produce even less educated people that it already does.  It won't be a problem if you can afford to send your kids to private schools...and if you think that "well they will make vouchers available"...Don't count on an educating voucher to cover the entire cost of a private school...You the parent will have to make up the difference. So basically the lower classes here in America will be denied a decent education.  Also if by some miracle little Sue or Johnny make it through primary education college will be a much more difficult beast to conquer. We have seen at State Schools a rise in Tuition average about 25% over the last three years (at least here in Western PA college tuition has gone up by about 25% over the last 3 years) and it is becoming more and more difficult for even an average family to send their kids to school. Don't even get me started on those young adults who are paying their own way....They now have to go into even more debt than before.   The reason that College Tuition is going up...Well lack of funding from the Feds...But mostly because states are struggling to pay their bills. The economy is so rough right now that states simply have to cut budgets and pass the cost on to students and their parents.  Yes the economy is improving according to the numbers...But those numbers don't tell you that the people benefiting from the slowly growing economy are the wealthy people. I saw recently that the average extremely wealthy person pays about 17% of their income to the government in taxes...While the middle class and the lower classes pay on average of 24% of their income to the government.  The people that are the engine of the economy and the main payers of taxes haven't yet seen real growth or pay increases.  Now if you take all of this into account and then look at what happens because your lower classes of people are less educated or completely un-educated you start to see some really bad things come to pass.  We all know that as long as we have a Federal Government we will always have the Military and Security forces and they will always receive the lions share of the federal budget.  What we don't see is that for many of the positions in both areas you need a college degree or high level of education. Take an Air Force Pilot...They won't talk to you if you don't have a college degree...  Now look at who typically goes into the military (even as pilots because you would think higher classes would sign up for that...But I argue differently)...The people who drive the military are in general lower class citizens...You won't find many rich kids in the military.  So what happens when these lower class people no longer have access to decent education...Well our military is going to suffer...Perhaps that is why the Air Force and other branches of the military are pouring money into  UAV's and such...If your plane doesn't need a pilot only a minder...Then hey who gives a rats ass if the recruits are well educated. The same goes for other technical aspects in the military...They are slowly becoming automated and need only for human minders to just keep an eye on things.  What is a real mind blower for you...Well it blew my mind. The people who are in the military...mostly from lower classes, they are also the ones who are paying for wars.   Enlisted men and women are essentially paying for the privilege to get you ass shot up in some foreign land...Isn't that a bite.  I would also argue that we no longer have a middle class. We have the upper classes which includes several layers...Those who never have to worry about money again, and then those who could loose it all in a blink of an eye but generally don't because they are "well leveraged".  The you have the lower classes which can then be broken down into several layers. There are the poor, those who are under or near the poverty line. You have the working poor, those who have a job or two but can't really make ends meet but manage month to month. Then you have what would be the formerly middle classes down here.   The middle class of the poor are those that have decent jobs, maybe college educated, and generally living beyond their means but they make it.  However any bump in the road may derail these people.  The upper middle class are those that are so close to being upper class they can nearly taste it...But they will most likely never make it. These people are college educated, have great jobs, and live lavishly, but again they don't have the money to just go on vacation out of the blue or spend a buttload of money on a purse shopping spree. These people are well off but as time moves on higher prices and taxes will slowly push these people to the brink and they will then have even less disposable income than they did before.  The key to rating classes for me is Disposable Income. This is the excess income after you have paid your bills and put money away for college tuition and retirement. The money that you can afford to blow on frivolous activities. The richer you are the more money you have to blow. To me that is pretty simple, and the most reliable way to figure out who is rich and who isn't.  So this whole post is about how the majority of the public is being screwed and on top of it all we are paying to screw ourselves.   I hope that something gives soon because I am damn tired of looking like a war monger in foreign lands, I am tired of being feared to the point where people will go out of their ways to kill us in the hopes keeping us away. I am tired of the overall good people here in America paying for others to suffer and put us in danger.  Peace

      I feel like shit. It is early in the morning and I just had all my drugs...but before I got them I puked my guts out. So hard that my nose bled a little. What really sucks is that I haven't eaten all that much in the past few days because everything has just tasted off to me. Since I came back to the hospital I haven't really had one good full meal. Like I say...nothing tastes right.  I muscled down some food tonight but a little later it decided that it was going to come back up for a visit.  I don't enjoy being sick like this. All of my energy is gone and while nothing is majorly off...something is still not ticking over correctly so you know I just have to feel like shit.  All I know is that when I went to get food the other night from the cafeteria I didn't take an O2 tank with me and by the time I staggered back up here I was almost at the point of passing out.  I just hope that I can get to a point where things are all semi-stable...because I don't like this feeling at all...even doped up it isn't pleasant...while I love all the drugs they are useless in the quest to make me feel level...only good health can do that.

      Oh yeah and I think I will be doing a little work on the blog here to spruce it up and rid it of some links. I am also going to seriously look into getting my own domain name and private host.  I feel once I get the majority of this illness out of the way I will be freed to persue what I want which is simple really.  I want a nice trendy (but not yuppie) loft apartment (preferably I would like to buy a building with a loft and either apartment units or a downstairs that can be a storefront or business). I will have it nicely furnished with lots of electronics and computers everywhere controlling all sorts of things. I would also set up a small hosting service of my own so that I can subsidize having my own fat internet pipe into the place...and on that I can do what I kinda have been floating in my head.  I want one of those floor beds...you know IKEA bed where it is low to the floor in a big king or queen size and a big down blanket. I want the apartment to be an open floor plan so that you can see everything in the place with the exception of two bedrooms and the bathroom (which will be the bomb) and the rest is just living space with a nice kitchen and living area...and the entertainment center will be a center all right. All around a Plasma or LCD TV screen (depending on if LCDs come down as they have been...oh and has to be 40+ inches)...THX certified surround, and a media computer that controls it all with HDTV, gaming, and lots of goodies that will be tied into my apartments network (both wireless and wired). There is the living and kitchen on the one side and the other side will be a home office with another kick ass computer with dual LCDs and uber specs for work...and a nice desk...I have that kinda picked out already because the one I want is glass topped and just look beautiful.  The bedroom will have a media center as well and a medium size LCD or Plasma screen and computer that is powerful enough...and for sleeping I could play mp3 with a kewl visualization on the Plasma or LCD...plus the sound system in there will be small but powerfull and clear. The bed and open closet design (and little storage things so it looks like I am anal).  The second bedroom will be a little more basic...a bed, dresser, and few other things...but it will be comfortable.  The kitchen will have a big ass fridge with a glass door so that I can see what is in it at anytime...kinda like a deli cooler. An island with the stove and oven and microwave...hanging above it is the pot rack (stainless steel all around)...just a tight looking kitchen.  The floors would be wooden...with possibly radiant heat built in (saw it on this old house and it looked neat as hell and keeps things warm and is efficient)...there will be area and throw rugs...but the floor has to be wooden...I have always loved a good wooden floor.  The place will be for both living and entertaining...not huge in space...but big enough that I can have people over and we won't be stepping over each other during a party (hence the big ass entertainment center that is  THX plus it will have speakers wired around the house...and there will be a place for wanna be DJs to jack in and spin if they please)...  I want these things because I could live there easily and comfortably for a long time. Plus if I get my ass going I could run a business or have rental units that will pay for the building itself. That would be the key to it all. The building must be able to sustain itself financially either through renting apartments or business space or by me running a business out of it.  The goal is set so that I have something to aim for. Once I have something along those lines and my life is moving towards the achievment of that goal...then I will be ready for a relationship with some hot super model...hehehe  And if not...all those LCDs and computers can put on porn throughout the house....  Oh yeah and I want the computers to be tied together and voice activated and for them to have a voice...like wakeup alarms...and I can say "set temp 70 degrees" and the system sets the thermostat, or I can say "tv history channel" and the tv I am addressing will turn onto the history channel.  Kinda like HAL without the homicidal tendencies.

      I wanted to give a quick update to the story that I posted yesterday early in the AM. Well the death toll in Madrid is now up to 190 (and expected to rise) and over 1400 injured.  It was three seperate attacks on three trains in three stations using a total of 10 bombs. At least that is what is known right now.  At first the Spaniards insisted that it was ETA, a freedom fighter group for a small bit of land in the Northern part of Spain right along the border with France.  Of coarse we chimed in and said it was Al-Queda. Some convieniant evidence shows up and it looks like it.  Nobody really knows who did it yet and we all need not jump to conclusions until we know more.  It was a trajedy and generally the people of the US send our best and we hope that you will not give in and your government will not turn counterproductive and revoke many of your rights unlike our own.  Well I am still in the hospital. I talked to the doc today (well technically yesterday) and he is going to try and get me out of the hospital. We are both a little leary because of the infection and we have not been able to isolate it. If he springs me I am afraid that I will bounce back into the hospital in a short time.  Whatever the decision is I will be happy and make the most of it because that is all I can do...and believe me I am living one day at a time.  Peace

      I have been thinking more and more about this whole morality thing that the nation is going through. How so many people were shocked by Janet's Nipple, and how the sex on the tele has just gotten out of control (the only time I would consider it out of control is if you go tumbling off of it while in the act...that is wild sex)...but regardless the entire nation...or rather many people in the nation have gone completely nuts and started making mountains out of molehills.  What it comes down to is that the Far-Right fundamentalists of the christian coalition and other radical groups have decided that the nation is filled with heathens and we all need saving.  For a person like me it scare me to think that these wacko's are now censoring what I can see on TV...not just the old standards and practices kind of censorship but rather the fuvor of censoring even minor things.   The first strike has already been done. We can't really do much about it right now...it can be fixed but it will take time. That first strike was the consolidation of the media giants. There are now but 7 major media giants and they literally control what we see on Tv and the Theatre...and even what we hear on the radio (with Clear-Channel or Infinity being the two companies who own the majority of radio stations).  With this consolidation it becomes very easy to control the message that is being spread. Simple and easy. If you own all the media you can tell the people whatever you want and the public have no other place to get news. The interesting thing is that most people will take what they are being told as the truth because it is coming from repsected sources. Hey its NBC...they tell the truth most of the time.  You see...easy.  Then you start with your second wave. This is the morality police. They come swooping in and start the argument that children are seeing to much on the TV and that things are out of control and it is about time for some restraint to be shown by the media giants...ok no problem. That happens.  Then once you have started getting little things done here and there...you start to go for larger prey and the outright dropping or pushing out of shows or people who do not share your views.  No this predicates on the idea that the media giants have given buttloads of money to one party and that party has happened to deliver them the ability to become even larger...so they are allowed to grow and they only have to take orders every once in a while...and most of those orders are rather benign compared to boycots that would start if the radical right isn't listened too.  So they target people and shows and get them fined and eventually thrown off the air.  This could never happen right?  It is and has already happened. Howard Stern is the most famous example as he has been pulled from several Clear Channel radio stations (including my own Pittsburgh station...and I enjoyed catching a show now and then) and will soon loose his job because the FCC will be fining him and his station soon...and rather than stick up for him they will fire him (he works for an Infinity station).  They claim they are pulling his shows due to his crude humor and him stepping over the decency line. Well he has been doing this for years and years. He has not recieved many repremands in the past from the FCC. If anything his show has gotten a little more tame over the years. So the decency thing doesn't really wash.  What changed is that he started talking out about Bush. Stern was a former Bush supporter as he is a liberaltarian and they vote mainly republican and he voted for Bush. Well he has changed his mind and decided to talk out about how things have gone whacky and that we are loosing our country of moderate people to a group of right wing nutters that carry crosses on their mini-vans and SUVs. Stern finds that frightening (as I do) and now he is targeted for removal. To be sure he will be removed.  They also went after Bubba the Love Pump down in Florida...for similar reasons.  Now compare it to some of the right wing morons like Hannity, Coulter, Rush, and many others and if you listen to right wing radio talk shows you will here more foul language and disgusting things out of them...and they are doing it to be funny or point out fact...they do it with a mean spirit and with the intention of riling people up.  Those guys say horrible things...but because they pull the party line they are fined or dropped from the air...so it has nothing to do with language or decency...it is about politics and silencing political dissodent and dissodents.  May we see this trick and fend it off for our own sake...because before to long we are going to have to clear our thoughts even through a government agency lest we want to run afoul of someone or something.  peace....

      Well I forgot to mention that I had to get a blood transfusion on Tuesday. 2 Units total. It seems that I am leaking from somewhere because during my last visit I was also having similar problems, mainly that my blood count was low, iron levels low, and a high white cell count. Basically I was sick, had a few vitamin and mineral problems with the levels being low, and I was low on blood most of the time.  This time it was enough to have to get a transfusion. I felt better later in the evening and yesterday all day I felt ok...so far today I feel so-so but not great. Hopefully after I get a little sleep I may feel a little better...which is important because I have to go start my car and run it up and down the garage to keep it from having problems from sitting to long.  Also this morning there were a series of bombs that went off in Madrid, Spain. Many people are dead (62 and rising as of 5:15AM Eastern time). It is sad because right now because the world have basically become unstable. Around the world you here of at least one bombing per day and many deaths.  All of the bombings have something in common that should be noted. All of the groups that are setting of the bombs are groups that are seeking greater rights or the ability to set up a nation of their own. All of the bombings have targeted the popular or predominant parties of nations. Basically most of them are Freedom Fighters.  Let me stress that I do not think bombing inocent citizens is a valid tool for fighting a power that is opposed to you. The only place that it has worked has been in Ireland...and frankly all of the bombings that the IRA committed didn't do much except to get moderates to the table. In the end the IRA had to stop bombing places and killing civilians and then they were able to make progress towards independance and peace. Today still there are tensions over there and the peace can be called shakey at best.  So it bombing civilians doesn't really get you far...but it does strike fear into the public at large. Sometimes drastic measures are needed to get negotiations going, and for me I can understand suicide bombers and bombings in general. When a people or group have to get to that point of dispair I can understand why things that are normally off limits become fair game.  All of the conflicts that are happening now would not be happening if we still had two superpowers pointing missiles at each other (we still do but they are no longer "those commie bastards"). During the cold war all of the little tensions around the world were essentially supressed because people were always at threat of nuclear war and local spats were simply not worth the energy.   Now that the cold war is over all of these little groups that have come out may well have the right to set up their own nations and govern themselves, but as always through history, the bigger governments won't let the little guys go (partly because the big guys that won't let them breakaway usually are not letting them break off because the little guys in that land have natural resources that the big guy needs to exploit) because of arrogance and ignorance.  So we all need to buckle up because it is only going to get worse until the governments of the world realize that they cannot run roughshod over their people, and that some groups it is just better to let them have their land or new nation then fighting it out with them.  Anyways...time for a nap...peace ya'll

      There is one Bush ad that is playing that is really pretty damn funny if you consider the Presidents past business dealings.  The ad talks about Americans having a strong entrepreneurial spirit and how they need a President who understands that.  Now the funny thing is that over 50% of small businesses that are opened each year will likely be closed within five years.  Another funny thing is Bush saying he understands business. Um yeah...that would explain his many failed companies and the millions that people threw into them just disappearing. Oh yeah and much of that money came from Saudi Royalty and Bin-Laden family.  It is just funny.

      Gitmo.  Our interment camp. Where there is no law, where there are no rights, where you go if you are A: possible terrorists B: Possibly political dissidents C: Or just plane baddies.  Ok so the last two we don't know about...and it is probably just conjecture, but how do we know for sure? We don't. As an American who has read the Constitution and The Bill of Rights I find it absolutely criminal, and I find it even worse that normal everyday American citizens have not questioned it at all. These people in charge are breaking not only our own laws to due process and speedy trials, but they are breaking International Law as well as the Geneva Convention which all nations essentially play by (well at least the "Western" Nations...most "Eastern" Nations don't play it by the letter..they still do some pretty nasty stuff to POWs...however I am sure that we do similar things).  We need to stop it plain and simple. We need to release all of the "detainees" and take them home and find some way of paying restitution to them..whether it be millions of dollars or help their country with giving aid, whatever they want we need to give it to them.  I understand the fears of the Pentagon and White House, they think that if they release them that these men and children will re-join Al-Queda or the Talliban, if they were part of those organizations in the first place. The problem is we don't know for sure who these people are and what their true affiliated were. It is very possible that we picked up 50% of these "detainees" and they have no affiliation with either group, they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time with a long beard. Some of them are indeed part of those organizations and may well be a threat if they are let go.  Now here is the real problem. We have held these people for two years or more without rights and in isolation. The problem is they are probably pretty pissed off at America and Americans. We may very well release them and they will join up with the first group that comes along and says "lets go destroy the great satan". That is our real problem.   We have bred hatred in them. Before we came along and picked these poor people up they may have disliked America but many of them (at least the ones who weren't Al-Queda and just simple Afghan peasants) remember that we helped them rid their country of the Russians in the 80's. Again they had no love for us, but they certainly weren't going to out of their way to kill us. Now those people (with a minor minority who actually practice the love of Islam and decide to forgive us) are definitely candidates that may well go way out of the way to exact some vengeance on us.  We can not avoid it sadly. There is no way that we can make it better. We stepped in the pile of shit and we are going to smell like it for a long time. We certainly can not keep these people until they die natural, over the years people will certainly get a bug up their ass about the whole thing and find some way to free them. We can not just execute them, that would lead to true International Outrage and may well trigger foreign countries to execute prisoners that are US citizens for some sort of revenge.   The only option is to release them, try and make it right, and just watch our asses because they are going to be there ready to do something should we slip up for even a minute.  Many people forget however the even larger picture to this all. Sure it is bad that we are holding these people without cause, without charge, without any legal rights, but it is what could set a precedent for the rest of the world.  If we can do that to foreign nationals, then any other nation can do the same to us under the reasoning of the Bush administration (or rather rule of tyranny). Imagine you are over in lets say Egypt...not the best place for Americans, but a hell of a lot better than say Iraq or Iran. Say the Egyptians get a bug up their ass and they come and pick you up at one of the pyramids. Now mind you they don't call the embassy and tell them "hey we have John Q. Public and he is being charged with goat molestation"...no they just snatch you up and lock you away. You cannot get letters out or make a phone call. Not only that but they hold you indefinitely and in addition the people holding you are not familiar with the English language (hey do you think the average troop has even a passing bit of Arabic language...sure there are some that can speak it well for interrogation, but the average "grunt" knows only a few commands and not much else).   Hopefully in the above example you can see that it is a real problem. If you think that it won't happen because you are an "American" and if you were held special forces would swoop in and rescue you. That only happens in the movies, very rarely does it happen in real life. Besides the Government doesn't even know you have been detained. If we really did those kind of things then we would be making many missions into South American nations to rescue Americans...but they don't, unless you are politically connected or very wealthy.  Being an American at this point in history is not a particularly good thing in the rest of the world. We have no special rights in the rest of the world, and we are not special.  Hopefully we can unseat our current "leader" (ha...leader...he's leading us alright...leading us to destruction) and get someone into the White House that will be willing to approach this all very humbly and ready with a lot of "I'm Sorry" cards from American Greetings. Unfortunately the person running against Shrub is Berry (I mean Kerry) and they are not to much different...both went to Yale and were members of the Skull and Bones club. Kerry went to Vietnam and won some medals so we know he isn't a complete chickenshit where Bush went AWOL from a reserves position and the most danger faced was stubbing his toe on a bench or jamming a finger when flying an obsolete jet.  We can hope that things will change just enough so that Americans can at least start to hold our heads level...but it will take many years of groveling before we can hold them high.  Peace...and to foreign readers. I assure you that not all Americans a trolls or evil people. Many of us are disgusted at what is going on. Many of us are mobilizing to save our nation, and hopefully to save some lives around the world. We aren't all beer guzzling, wrestling watching, inbred, and married to our cousins uncles sister in law who is the mother of Billy's kid your best friend. We aren't all like that. Many of us want and will change our nation for the better...and you can help us by supporting the non-cretins amongst us and recognize that some of us are trying...it is just hard because we have to live it day in and day out...and sometimes we tire.  Peace...

      For an interesting video go check this out. It's about Bush and how he got where he is.   Good little video   It may take a few minutes for you to load and it is 56 minutes long...but certainly worth the time.

      Well the United States finally claim the number one spot in the world for at least one thing.    We have the highest level of STD's in all of the industrialized world. 1/3 of all Americans will get some sort of STD at some point during their lives. Of the 19 million or so new infections of various STD's almost half (49%) of those people are in the age bracket of 15-24.  You gotta love this country...maybe that will be a deterant to people wanting to come here. Maybe we can have a whole new slogan for the nation. "Come to America, get a free STD" or "STD's...an all-American tradition"...or maybe we should give some tips to people "Avoid the clap" (especially effective on resteraunt bills where is says "Tip"...waitresses love that...especially the ones that look like they have been ridden hard and put up wet...and those ladies are often found at truck stop food dives).  So we need to be proud of something.  Peace...

      Ok...we now know that Republicans want to rule the world and they will attempt it in any way possible..and that the media consolidation of late is a prime example of how they will do it. Through stifling any dissent against them or Premiere Bush...or Dictator Bush...whatever the hell he is because no matter what the supreme court says...he didn't actually win the election just like he never really finished his reserve duty.  The RNC has warned CBS stations not to air the Moveon.org commercials saying that they are illegally funded and break the rules of 527's (a new class of PACs). A 527 is allowed to collect as much money as they want from donors and they can publish ads that knock candidates but they cannot explicitly endorse any candidate.   Well if you have been watching TV lately you have probably seen a few moveon.org ads. They do a pretty effective and truthful job of attacking Shrub. Notice in the commercials they never once endorse a candidate, they just attack Bush. Well they are allowed to do that.  The RNC states that they can't do that. Well the election commission sees it otherwise and says that they can as they are following the rules.  So if you stand for stifling free speech, are for saying anyone who opposes your point of view, or anyone who may remotely disagree with you on any subject...than the Republican party is for you. All they want is world domination and all the money.  It is yet more proof that the Neo-Cons want to run everything and are willing to do anything to get their way. It lends greatly to the idea of shipping them all off along with anyone in Israel that identifies themselves with the Lakud party, or any person that is born out of Taliban or Al-Queda thinking, to a remote island and arm them to the teeth. Let them destroy each other...and once one party is left standing the rest of the civilized world take a joint action and bomb the island back into the sea to make sure that we can be rid of all this nonsense.  This makes me want to take what is left of my life and go start killing key people that are causing problems for America...and believe me there are both Republicans and Democrats on the list....no one in power would be safe.  Alas I am to sick to do it though...but a guy can dream can't he.

      Today, well more like yesterday Dean launched his "new" idea...so far I am underwhelmed, but hey it is just getting started.    Democracy for America, Dean's "new" idea.   What it looks like he wants to do, and really it is a good idea, is keep the grassroots movement that he and Trippi started and give it direction for not just the Presidential race, but all races from local to state to national. In addition he wants to try and get the disparate groups together and pool resources and unify them all into a single entity with many specialties.   I would imagine part of that would be getting people along the line that can go on to a News show or talk show to counter the Right's onslaught of pundants, experts, and policy wonks. Everyone would be under a unified banner while keeping their individual ideals and direction. Kind of like how our nation is set up. We have states that make their own laws and go about enforcing them and take action one way, but all of the States fall under the Republic of America or know as The U.S.A.  That so far as I can tell, and coming out of various Republican campaigns that I had worked in over the years, is the weakest part of the Liberal movement is lack of coherence and direction. You have a thousand groups pulling in different directions at once. It is not a wonder that the Liberal point of view has largely been lost in the din of the Republican machine. If they were to get together and pool resources the movement could go a lot farther and have more of an impact on policy.  Another thing that has been a big mark against liberals is that people think that is a dirty word...well many Americans at least. The Republicans have won a major coup by redefining the word and turning Liberals into these Ivy League pricks that all they want to do is raise taxes and then go out and spend the money on the National Endowment of the Arts so some starving no hack artist can carve a penis out of prison soap.  The reality is that Liberals are far from that...well ok maybe one or two want to do that, but almost all of them to a tee want to see the Government returning services for the massive amounts of money it collects each year. The majority of that money they currently collect go towards the Military, and hey when is the last time the Air Force gave you a call asking if you wanted to take the new F-22 Raptor out for a spin, or the Army drops by and lets you run the M1-A1 Abrams through its paces and fire off a few practice rounds. It doesn't happen.  Liberals want to see that needs are met for the neediest, and that our infrastructure doesn't fall into disrepair (which it already has).   What is funny is that some have been calling for National Single Payer Health Insurance. In other words health care for everyone or universal health care. Republicans have been saying "it will never work, it will cost to much, sounds a little bit like a communist idea". The Republicans also paint it that everyone is against it. Well that really isn't the case. Currently GM has billions of dollars of yearly outlay for health insurance for current and retired workers, they estimate that 1200 dollars from each vehicle they sell goes directly to health care. Other companies are seeing similar problems. As health insurance prices go up, the harder it is for a company to afford them. They have to raise the employee contribution portion, or lay off people, raise prices on the product or service they provide, or in some cases they move plants overseas or to Canada where either Health care isn't thought about (China, India...have health care but state sponsored and not really high tech) and to Canada where they have great health care and it doesn't cost the operator/owners of businesses a lot of money.   It doesn't help that the worlds largest company Wal-Mart doesn't really offer good health care, and most of its workers don't carry the company insurance unless they are management, most of the "associates" don't get the insurance. With that huge group not having insurance when they get sick and need to go to the hospital, then the entire system pays and prices have to go up to cover the uninsured.  The health care system is in a mess. So many of the larger companies are coming around to universal health care. 60% of Doctors are willing to take minor pay cuts if it lessons paperwork, and along with it there is some sort of malpractice lawsuit reform. I am not saying tort reform, but rather a new system that vettes out the bogus claims and allows the real ones to go on to court where the person can get a bijjilion dollars or whatever.  It is estimated that if we moved to single payer we would see a saving in administrative costs of almost 300 Billion (yes Billion) dollars and that would nearly cover all of the currently uninsured.  It is all a big mess that can be fixed...and with this grassroots idea it could be used as a lobbying tool, but also a public education tool that informs people of the misconceptions that have often been floated by the Republicans.  So that is where I think it will be headed...it is going to take some time to get rolling, but once a stone starts rolling downhill sooner or later that stone picks up speed and by the time it is at your doorstep it have enough force to blow right through your door.   Peace  Oh yeah and I am going to work on links and stuff when I feel well enough to code it out.

      Now I know these poll results are more than likely scewed...because we all know that the Presidential Race will be much closer than what this poll shows...but it is interesting nonetheless.  I wish that the site had a place where you could write in your vote...I would have given Dean a vote. Suprisingly even Nader scores higher than Bush....I could only wish and hope that this really was how things are going...but we live in the real world.   Here is the poll that I am talking about.   Maybe it will come true...we can only hope.  Again the poll is by no means really representative of what is going on (although more and more people are pissed off now towards Bush). The poll is being held by a liberal group so...take it with a grain of salt.  Finally a journalist has done his/her job and came prepared for an interview. Who was the interview with? None other than our pal Donald Rumsfeld or Rummy for short (because he must be swilling gallons of the stuff if he really believes what he says...you could only believe it all if you were high or drunk or of some sort of altered mental state). I don't know who the reporter is or news guy...but I would love to buy him a beer because he came prepared and actually called Rummy on one of his many lies and in doing so set ole' Rummy on the defense...when he is confronted with the truth he breaks down and starts backpeddling as fast as he can. Watch the video from the link below.   Classic Video that call Rummy on his lies...priceless!   Peace  Probably larger update later...

      As many of you who read my blog with any regularity know that I am not a fan of Shrub's Administration at all. Many of you know that I voted for him in 2000...and I regret that vote all the way. Every chance that I get on my blog I like to go after topics and issues that Shrub has screwed up or lies about.  Now don't take me as just a simple Bush hater. I hate him for sure, but my hatred is of equal opportunity. I really just hate overall politicians and the system overall. I think that it is no longer for the people at all and has been corrupted by money for not even "special interests" anymore...it is now just the government works for the corporations.  Unfortunately the average citizen is poorly informed of the past. Most people simply don't know history. So lemme give you a quick little American History lesson. Really I will only focus on the latter part of the 1800's and then this past century the 1900's.  In the late 1800's the nation saw the rise of Robber Barons. These men were "capitalists" of first class ratings...something that many current businessmen would love to emulate and move towards once again. These Robber Barons exploited labor, exploited the land all for the mighty dollar. There was very little regulation of business at that point in time and the Robber Barons spent vast amounts of money on politicians to keep it that way.  These "men" made their wealth on the backs of other real men and never gave back or rarely gave back.   The 1930's saw some change in the air. The depression was in full effect and the average citizen was suffering either working many hard long hours for almost nothing (with the fear that if they tried to stand up to their employers that they would be fired...and if you had a job you were lucky and did nothing to rock the boat). The wealthy continued to do well. As a matter of fact their wealth soared while the average American barely and rarely put food on their tables.  Some people that had both money and a conscious saw that it wasn't really right and with their political positions started to do something that had never happened before. The government started passing laws that limited what businesses could do to employees and started to give the employees sort of sharing in wealth. The government also embarked on a public works building spree. During this time we saw thousands of miles of roadways paved, the Hoover Dam...you get the idea.  Also Social Security was also passed during this revolutionary period.  Basically what was happening was that the government wasn't taking from the rich or redistributing wealth...instead it leveled the playing field as best as possible and with the leveling that allowed for ordinary Americans to move forward and earn more money.  These laws and regulations continued for years. New things happening all the time. The minimum wage laws, child labor laws, the EPA, and many other things came into being. These changes were happening all the way into the 70's. Nixon was the President that signed the EPA into law and existence.   Sure Democrats were usually at the center of the social programs and the ones who pushed hard...but if we look back we can see that many prominent Republicans actually proposed and passed many of the social programs.  In the eighties things really changed...do we need to say why.  The middle class is not an actual entity. It is not natural in a capitalist system. There are two levels period. You are either wealthy or poor...no in between. The side effect or symptom of many of the social programs and laws that were passed to protect workers and the environment actually produced the middle class. The middle class was a byproduct of these laws.  During the eighties the Reagan administration started to dismantle many of those laws...well no they would take a bolt out here and a nut there...and while the laws remained they were weakened. Same thing happened under Bush 1. Clinton reversed some of the trend but in many other ways helped it along.  This Bush...GW...he has really dismantled a lot of those laws and programs. Not quietly but with glee and in the open.  Now that many of these things have been taken apart guess what has happened.  The Middle Class has almost completely disappeared. The class will be extinct in a short time.  Which brings me to what I really wanted to talk about...and that is jobs.  Right now our economy is in full recovery...or so the administration line goes. Well we really aren't if you are on the street or in public. Hey the stock market has been doing well (up until this past week and this week), but as I have said many time...Wall-Street has nothing to do with the real world. Sure they can be an indicator of how weak or strong the economy is...but it is by no means a predictor of job or economic growth.   Sure we are seeing growth...but much of it is credit card economic growth. The government is spending money like it grows on a tree and that helps grow the economy because they are buying stuff. Sooner or later that has to end because they will run out of credit.  Some companies are doing great...but their bottom lines have improved through layoffs, increased productivity from remaining employees, and lastly (but growing quickly as a reason to worry) through outsourcing and offshoring (outsourcing is being used incorrectly most of the time...that means to part out work to a contractor...offshoring is the correct term...it means that jobs are actually going overseas or out of the country).  Jobs have not been created. Sure the unemployment numbers have been falling, they are falling because so many jobless people have used up assistance, and stopped looking for work altogether. This means that our workforce is actually shrinking...and that is bad news.  Last month there were 21 thousand new jobs. However none of them were created in the private sector. All the jobs were created by government at the state and local levels.  Really this all wraps around to that right now we are looking at an unprecedented time in our history. We once again are seeing the rise of the Robber Barons just like in the beginning of the 20th century. I just hope that we are not doomed to repeat history...Unfortunately the adage stays true and never fails. If you don't know where you have been you won't know where you are going...or something like that.  The parallels are frightening...only this time the stakes are higher with abilities of the armies of the world to destroy the world many times over...and on top of it all our Environment is so battle scared that whether or not the planet can support us if we don't do something to conserve what is left is up in the air.   I hope we can fix things...but I hold little hope because the ordinary American has such a lack of knowledge about history...and this all isn't even ancient history...rather it is recent and you would think we could at least remember back 20, 30, 50 years.  Read up folks...then act to change.

      Well I am finally back home. You have no idea how different it is to go from a sleek little laptop or notebook back to a clunky desktop...even though my desktop is far from clunky.  The main thing is relearning typing. Of course the notebooks keyboard is smaller...and this is much bigger...but you wouldn't really notice unless you go from using a notebook exclusively back to a keyboard...I guess...maybe...I dunno...if you have ever had to make the adjustment you would know.  Well there isn't much to say outside of that I got a feeding tube placed. YAY! Well small case yay...it hurts like a bitch and will do so for a few more days I am sure...and all I have is really a pea shooter for elephant pain. Oxycontin is great for long term pain, Oxycodone is great for minor, dull, easily numbed pain, but this is elephant hurts like a bitch needs morphine or dilaudid pain killer level. It really hurts like a bitch. Not that those pain killers take away all the pain, but they take away the constant nag pain and leave only the sharp pains that accompany coughs and sudden movements. So right now I am in pretty bad pain.  Now that I am home I hope I can get a hold of people over the next few days depending on I am feeling. If I am in a shitload of pain then fuck it...I am going to be a hermit. If the pain is manageable then I will call people...because even breathing deep hurts like a bitch...  Well goodnight all...I am going to try and get a little sleep and another 1000 calories while I attempt to sleep....yippie!

      This update is going to be short as all I can muster is shortness right now.  My laptop is going to have to go back in to the shop because the DVD/CD-R/RW is on the fritz. It still burns CD, and sometimes it will read CD's, but it will not read DVD's. I have tried several and two were new DVD's...so we know it isn't the media.  This frustrates me because my last Toshiba was reliable up until the end when it started to not read CD's.  We are going to see what we can do because frankly if the laptop is going to have to keep going into the shop then I don't want the hassle. So we are going to see if we can just get a refund...this make two serious problems in three months and I don't want to risk anymore.  If we get it returned then I will go completely insane and get an E-Machines laptop. M6805 Model, Mobile Athlon 64 3000+ (1.8Ghz), 512MB RAM, 60GB Hard Drive, ATI 9600 with 64MB graphics, 15.4" screen, DVD/CD-R/RW. The package is 1500 or something close to that and a 100 dollar rebate.   I hope that they will take this piece of crap back so I can give something else a go. I just don't want to have fight with it anymore...and I foresee that I will be returning this thing back to the shop a lot...and if that is the case then it certainly not worth the time or energy.  Jeesh...everythings gotta fight.

      I haven't updated in a few days again...I am getting lazy about this whole blogger thing. I need to get my ass back on the ball and get back to my political speeches and general hate towards all sorts of things conservative and crap that is even remotely associated with the Neo-Con right and their hate filled group.  Ok so what new is happening in my little world...outside of getting a little better each day not much. I am trying to get myself up to full speed and then find something to do until I get a transplant...if I get a transplant.  My sister got a job offer...essentially a little over 50 thousand a year...that makes me feel like a complete and total loser...which I am. I am never going to be employable...it is as simple as that. No one or company will employ me for any length of time because I am not healthy...and to even think about insurance...hahahah forget about it.  Getting the transplant will change all that right? Nope...not in the least. First of all a transplant is not a cure, nor is it a permenant solution in all reality. A transplantee has a 50% chance of survival out to 5 years...odds haven't been given to me for after that time. So in reality...or bringing the elation back down to Earth and actually thinking critically about it, at best a transplant adds five years to your life, or life as such. You can figure that the first year even if things go swimingly well you will still spend most of it recovering and getting up to speed. The remaining years can be broken up into another two phases as I see it. The first phase is good health overall as far as the lungs are concerned and not many problems. The second phase is probably the last year or so of that time (or a persons life if you want to be real about it) you see your health decline and problems start popping up and you start to get sick and feel like shit. You then die.  Hey...I am just being real about it.   So what does this have to do with me and a job? I want to be productive in some way. Earn money so I can do things and get a Mini Cooper. I just want to be normal as possible. I know that I cannot be.  I have so much in my head and so much that I feel that I have to say...but I have no credentials, I have no voice, I am a mute in a world full of people with bullhorns. Maybe one day someone will see what I feel, but that day must come soon as I don't know what I am going to do. I haven't decided to definitely get the transplant, I haven't decided on anything so who knows.  I am tired...and Taken is on. I am going to lay down for a bit and watch that...and read Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men"...so far a pretty vicious book...in a way that makes me wanna go and take money directly from rich whitey.  Peace...

      Ok well it again has been a few days and that was because I went to the hospital and while I got my laptop back I didn't have the proper cable to sign on and update...although I wasn't really all that much in the mood to do much of anything seeing that my ass was broken. They put me on GoLytly (I am not sure of the spelling)...that stuff works and works well. They should have given that to me a while back because it has been the only thing that has worked repeatedly and regularly. Well my ass is working again and that is good. I only spent two days there this time.  I am hungry but I can't figure out what I want to eat and frankly I have little desire to cook anything.  Well I am going to stop my bitching and go to bed. Love to all...peace out.

      I haven't written to this thing in a few days because my ass is broken. Yes it is broken. I haven't been able to go to the bathroom since I left the hospital. That hurts and sucks...so now I have to try and get it fixed. Hopefully I won't have to go back in to get it fixed...hopefully it can be fixed with something from the drugstore...because I don't want to go back in for a broken ass.

      Well I am back in the hospital this evening...yay for me. Its ok because I am getting sick and I need to be here to get things well again...or at least keep things from getting to far out of hand. It will already be hard enough to get these bugs under control so might as well get started as early as possible before a deep infection gets itself entrenched in there.  Outside of that I am still damn tired and I am hoping that while here in the hospital I will get a little sleep which would be nice...especially if I can get a cocktail of things that will knock me out.  Well I am tired and I stink from my PEG (feeding) tube...it smells south of cheese.  Oh by the way folks if you get a chance go see Ladykillers...damn funny movie that ends very differently than what you may think. While many critics have panned it calling it schlock essentially. I beg to differ. It is a Cohen brothers film which by default is quirky comedy, it also inherits a great use of the English language (and coming out of Tom Hanks he just does it justice even with the weird accent...almost correct for the place in MS that he says he is from), but the comedy is intelligent and you have to think about some things.  Let me help a few of you out there with one thing from the movie. When Hanks is introducing all the cohorts to each other and he gets to the General and describes him as a tunnelling expert from French Indochina...that means Vietnam, rather seeing that he was a General and a tunnelling expert then he is North Veitnamese. I am sure that many people don't know that...especially if you were raised during that period as it is not really a thing that they teach you in school...and many college profs. don't tell you that either. It is just a little bit of Jeopardy Knowledge...but it is accurate.  Also one other thing. For those who are looking at the screen and wondering who Mr. Pancake is. He is the Psychiatrist from the Original "Law and Order"...he replaced Dr. Olivet somewhere around 96-97 I believe. Anyways that is who he is so you don't rack your brains to hard.  I am tired and worn out...so I will rest now.  Peace...

      Oh and I have been sneezing like sneezy dude...all the damn time. Plus I can't keep warm or cold either way. I end up uncomfortable so that sucks and that is why I can't get a good nights sleep...I get hot and sweat then I get cold and shiver...then it happens all over again.  I have tried all sorts of things including turning the heat up so I wouldn't need blankets...buff dat'...didn't work. Tried turning the heat down and cracking the windows to get it cool in there...nope...so I might need to get to the hospital to get some damn sleep.  Gaa!!!!  Peace again....

      Sorry for the lack of posts. I am sick yet again and my PEG (feeding tube) is infected. I went to the doc today and he thinks it is and put me on yet another anti-biotic.  I am coughing a lot more and shit...tomorrow morning one of the nurses from the clinic will be calling me and if I am not feeling the slightest better she will get Dr. P and see what he wants, which will be head to hospital. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars. Which I guess will be ok because they will be able to get me back on drugs that will knock my ass out for a bit so I can get some sleep. I haven't been sleeping hardly at all...and it sucks ass!  Oh and speaking of 200 dollars I went to the Social Security Office and got some things straightened out and the money that has been deducted from my monthly SSD money for Medicare A+B will be refunded to me...now the problem is for how long back...I have been paying it since Oct 2002. PA picks up the cost of that when you are in a position like myself, disabled and not doing well...and while they should have been paying all this time something and some people didn't do there jobs...of course. So now we have it straightened out. I will be looking at between 600-900 back from them if they go all the way back to Oct 2002...normally they wouldn't go far that back (the state) but because they screwed up in the first place they are at least going to review the case and it looks like I will get some sort of chunk of change back. I will know on May 25 what the news is and how much I guess....nonetheless is that they will be picking the cost up from now on.  Well I am headed to bed...I feel like shit and I think that I will end up in the hospital tomorrow.  Peace...

      Well my port is getting infected again. Whoopie!  Outside of that I am headed down to physical therapy to walk on a treadmill and work with weights. Does anyone know how much I dispise physical activity, I avoid it at all costs because I am pretty lazy when I am aloud.  Well I am going to finish this lunch and then go to therapy....

      I watched the Bush's little press conference and he yet again has confirmed that he is one dumb ape.  I find it hard to take seriously any person who says "terrists" and "my fello merricans". He seems to not be able to read very well because when he was reading his speech he had trouble sounding out some of the words.  The Q&A was a joke. It was so staged that Andrew Loyd Webber would have been proud. When he was asked questions about whether or not he felt that he was in some part responsible for letting our guard down, or simply to appologize he said "I think back to that day and it makes me sick". What did he have some bad crab cakes that day? The correct responce should have been of sorrow and looking for absolution because he and his staff have clearly to many now, fucked up.  Even more now then ever I feel that the people in power of this nation at that time knew exactly or knew well what was going to happen and to be able to get their way they let it happen.  Since then we have invaded a nation that had nothing to do with terrorists. A nation that happens to be sitting on massive amounts of oil. Now I people may say "yeah the oil thing" in the classic way thinking that it is for our nation. Actually we get very little of our current oil needs out of the middle east. However Europe's oil and natural gas suplies come from that area.   This is giong to be an economic card that we can use down the road to either hinder the European's economy or ability to make war. So what I see is that we just bought ourselves a little insurance because down the road the next major power will be coming out of Europe both economically and militarily. Imagine if the Europeans joined with Russia. All of a sudden you have a massive power that cannot be stopped. With our control over at least Europe's supply of oil and fuel we can dissuade them from challenging us. The Russians have their own oil fields...but we are making a play for that as well. Afghanistan, Kazakstan, and several other "stans" and those nations around the Ural Sea are sitting on the same oil that supplies the Russian oil fields. While we can't turn off the tap to them, we can certainly reduce the overall supplies available.  Of course at the same time that oil that we now kinda own is great collateral towards issuing bonds and such.  Bush was lieing on stage there as he was lieing back in 2003.  I feel for the people that don't understand the larger picture here. To get what the Neo-Cons want they had to have an initial attack against us. So when this came down the pipe instead of preventing it, or even feining that they were doing something, they let it happen and then had their reason for starting this war against others. The war on terror is not a valid war. War by definition is against a state actor and cannot be against a group or idea.  I feel for those parents of soldiers that are so misled and still support what is going on. If I were a parent today and a child of mine was faced with having to go into a war like this then I would have to say no and protest loudly because as I said....war can only be waged against a State (Nation), not ideas or a group.  For those who have lost loved ones in Iraq...I am sorry. I am sorry that I cast my vote this last time for Bush. I am sorry for the party that I used to belong to. I am sorry that your children are having to go over to Iraq in my stay for something that is absolutely wrong.  The problem with being there now is that if we pull out cold turkey then the place will fall into shambles and many will suffer and die, if we stay there we will loose many more people and our nation will once again be forced into a draft.   Yes folks a draft. It will be the only way that the military will be able to get enough warm bodies to put over there if the plan even to deploy 100,000 for the time being (we already have gotten the hint that we will need around 140-150 thousand at all times for a long time...and that doesn't give us a sure victory). Right now our military is really stretching thin. How can we tell this? Because we are calling up even National Guardsman because they already have deployed most of the reservists and all of the active duty. Now you have many soldiers over there being told they will have to stay longer than the anticipated year they were initially told.  Pretty soon they will run through all of the troops they can rotate through and then they will have to draft people. The draft boards just recently have been calling on local delegates to come in for training and other stuff. The official story is that the Draft Board people are at the end of their 20 year commitments and that new people are needed. That doesn't was though considering the draft was ended in the early to mid 70's then the newest of the board members would have been done in the ealry to mid 90's. Now we are remanning the Draft Boards. Sounds fishy, and considering that the Administration has been really good at lieing (not covering up though).  Another small note I would like to say. When one senior government employee comes out and says that the administration is doing this or that. You can say "well maybe they have sour grapes". The second employee, well he was fired so he has a bone to pick. Third person the same story about this and that. By about the dozen or more employees and some being very high up like Clarke and O'neill with no reason to lie (becuase their asses are on the line as well) then you have to start to think and believe that all of these people can't be making it up. The conclusion that a person has to come to is that the Administration really was doing all of the things they were accused of (especially when it was confirmed over and over again by different people) then they must have been doing it. When the White House then launches a smear campaign against the people speaking out, that should also be a hint that the White House has much to cover up. If Clarke and O'neill were really as bad as the administration says they were then why didn't they fire them earlier and why didn't they come right out when the person was gone and level the accusations against them before they spoke out. It is all too convieniant that after these people blow the whistle is when the smear starts and not when they left or before they started to talk. This is just rational people. I will take all of those supposed "sour grapes eatin" people's word over just a few like Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and Rumsfeld. We all know what those "men" have done, they have drug us into wars and taken away many of our freedoms, so I don't trust any of them. I trust the recently unemployed from the Bush white house.  Peace

      Ok so Ashcroft is a moron and a lier.  Notable Quotes: "Evil Chemistry" "Evil Biology"  Ben-Venista - "So you had no experience in dealing with Washington beauracracy"  Ashcroft on his private jetting about because of "threats". "I still fly on commercial airlines for personal business, as a matter of fact my wife just flew on a commercial carrier."  And the excuse as far as I could tell for not using commercial airlines all the time was because of his security detail carrying weapons and that poses problems on airliners.  He just needs to be bumped off so he can sit by his father...Satan. He is evil...very evil. Listen to him sing sometime and you will know that he is evil. He sings like a bad televangelist. Now that is evil.  Oh he wants more power for Patriot Act and finds no fault in holding people secretly and indefinitely.  EVIL I TELL YOU...I think even Satan would shove pinapples up his ass.

      Ok so I got my computer rebuilt in about 3 hours with all the basics. The only thing that is really left to do is install a few media players and codecs, and update Windows. The updating is a long process because while the Cell phone connection is faster than dial-up, it is still slow for big files.  I am hoping that maybe I can get up and running here soon and get moved on with my life. It is time. I don't know what I will do for money or a job as I don't have a degree (and frankly my health even if I get a transplant may still be an issue...the transplant doesn't cure you...it only "fixes" the problem).  I am hoping that when I get moved on I can live comfortably and with niceties...but nothing fancy. I just want to finally be free from everything and on my own as best as I can.  Realistically I know this can't and won't happen unless I go through with transplant. I was dead set against one for years, then I decided to go ahead, now I am just having doubts and fear and not feeling right about it all. I mean I have done stupid things and wasted my life up to this point and not accomplished much of anything...why do I deserve another shot at it all? Will I do it differently? I really can't answer that. I wish I could. I am just frightened and frankly I still have no one to talk too.  When I was in school still I went to the counseling center every week for a little over a year (well at least while I was there and it was open). I had a great counselor...but while it helped for a few hours or maybe a day afterwords I would crash right back down into my self loathing state. I don't want pity or anything like that...I may have sought it at one time but it never did any good. The problems always remained the same. I am self destructive in many ways...all of them attributable to the fact that I will die young if I don't get a transplant, and if I did I could only look forward to a few extra years realistically.  It really is a hard position to be in. My family seems to be pushing for the transplant and just assumes that I want to do it and will do it because I have gone through the procedures to get listed. I got listed simply because I would rather be listed and not accept, then not and all of sudden find myself in the position that only a transplant will save me and me not being on the list would basically be the death nell.   I don't know how to approach it all. This is new and there are no answers.   I feel really alone. I have people around me, my family supports me, and I have a few people that I consider my friends (but don't ever see them because of my poor ass health). There was a brief period where I didn't feel alone but the person that was in my life at the time felt alone with me because I couldn't open up (which I couldn't without looking like I was seeking pity). I have never felt that way again and frankly I won't. Simply because I don't have the energy or drive to even consider getting into another relationship unless I literally fell into one (in other words I don't even have to work at it outside of being nice...and that ain't happening anytime soon). So what to do, what to do.  I hate to post these words because it leaves me open...but I promised myself that I would never self censor unless it was for legal reasons...otherwise everything and everyone was fair game. It has gotten me into trouble with some friends and family because I have pretty much stuck with that.   That is what this blog is about. The complete lack of censorship, and just plain out stupidity on my part (because I have a lot of stupid thoughts and many people read them here). This blog is not my ultimate chronicle or anything, but it is a telling of my attitude from day to day and my political leanings because it all ties together for me. My life is thinking to much, writing jibberish, being outraged at the latest things coming out of D.C. (from all sides because most of our law maker I am sure are just plain retarded...or crooked as hell...or both). Hell it is all tied together...and for me I feel that it is my welfare that is at stake when those morons get a good idea. When they want to reform Medicare, that effects me. When they cut back on funding for health care funding to the states, well that effects me. The cut the budget for education. That effects me because students get dumbers, and sooner or later those students become workers and with most of them being dumb (even ones that get a college degree) by thinking that the American way is avoiding their duty...and the Christian way is not helping people (that one I will never get...where in the bible does it not say to help your fellow man...the Bible says over and over again to help them)...but damn when workers wages go down they pay less into the system that helps keep me alive.  When we go to war I get worried. Not because my ass will be on the imediate front...but because when we go to war things at home go to shit. With this war that our "leaders" have gotten us into could very well involve us all (and I believe that the essentially good...but stupid people of the USA will reap the whirlwind of how or leaders have abused and run our good names into the ground).   So everything that goes on I think about. I am selfish I guess...but it is because the welfare of society that it effects me. If society as a whole is doing well, people are working, kids are learning something outside of pigskins and sports stats, and we are at peace with our neighbors on this tiny planet then things will be good for me (and everyone else). If things are shitty...sooner or later that shit falls on us here.  My biggest fear is that we are already to late to fix things. We could start doing things correctly tomorrow but that won't guaruntee that things will be ok...it is still a role of the dice for that. Yet our "leaders" and many of my fellow Americans think that screwing up our planet (in any number of ways) is ok and that we still have time to fix it...let the technology mature a little and the cost come down and then we will implement things. Well fuck people...things don't get less complicated unless you are implementing them, prices don't fall if the products aren't ever offered (even novely in the case of the GM electric car).  Then we have the people that do want things to change sabotaging things as well. I have the solution to how to get "free" hydrogen without using nuclear reactors or stripping it from hydrocarbons (fossil fuels...which kinda defeats the purpose if you still need gases to fuel your hydrogen vehicle). The answer is simple...but it is scary because we have to become godlike. We have algea that goes around making the vast majority of our oxygen on this planet...we know how to tinker with the basics of genetics. I am sure with enough funding and trial and error we could come up with a bacteria or algea that instead of belching out oxygen it spews hydrogen. Hey the new bugs and stuff you create that don't work...well destroy them and then they can't slip into the wild. As for the bacteria or algea that does work you control it carefully because you don't want it taking over and making our atmosphere toxic (and we could even engineer a way to kill it directly without harming other algeas or bacteria). However we have those nuts who see any form of genetic engineering for any purpose as bad and they forget that man has been playing with genetics for thousands of years. Man has been for all of agricultural time been crosspollenating and creating new species or types of corn, wheat, and all sorts of plants. The have orange trees that spit out grapefruit as well. So we have been doing it for a long time now...only now we understand what we are doing and have better tools to work at the genetic level than ever before. Sure its scary...but we have to go down the road or someone else will.  That is the problem here in our nation. Once we were adventurers. Once we took chances. We made many mistakes and screwed up a lot as well as being the cause of most of the environmental problems. However now instead of being bold we are being timid and not facing issues. Instead of venturing out we are shuttering ourselves in just like any other fundamentalist society. We are slipping back into another dark ages because we are being told that progress is evil...and because we are so afraid they may be right we defer to their judgement when in reality those are the very people that have caused much of the untold death and suffering throughout the ages. Yet they accuse anyone who wants to move on and progress as people who want to destroy life.  Wake up people. Those are all the things I ponder daily...and for many of those reasons they are why I have doubts about a transplant...because if I can puss out without pussing out before all the shit hits the fan...I would rather do that then try to survive through what I feel are impending horribly dark and dangerous times.  The only way we can even think of avoiding those bad times is by changing things completely...and rebuilding almost from the ground up. I am also thinking about this whole capitalist system and think that it is a model that cannot work. Like Dr. Nash has pondered if we all are attempting to attain the same goal then all of us will loose. So we need to rethink what we are doing.  Do that...if nothing else think about these things. We won't suffer a loss of quality of life if we no longer "make" money but instead earn a living. Changing from fossil fuels to hydrogen and other power sources will not cost us as much as we think...it will cost less than having to invent some sort of technology to scrub the atmosphere or running it so far into the ground that only the rich survive because they can afford to rocket off this rock that they screwed up through poor leadership. All leaders are rich...all of the rich are leaders. It isn't a coincidence...it is the sad fact. Those few that are born leaders rise to be rich. Those rich that aren't leaders loose it all.  Just think...  Peace

      Well I did it today. I pissed my mom off. Over something stupid too.  I have been watching Band of Brothers on The History Channel and have been really enjoying it. The couple of nights that my mom has been here during the show she starts to knatter on about one thing or another...tonight it got to me.  She told some story tonight about a skit on MadTV...she thinks I didn't listen but I did...heard every word of it. It just wasn't funny and when she was telling me in the middle of the show I was less able to pay attention. The respiratory therapist was in here to beating on me so they were chatting back and forth making it very difficult for me to hear what was going on.  Tonight I just let her know...obviously it was the wrong way. I just said "I will just catch it later tonight"...she then just went off.  Now I know I am an ass sometimes and I haven't been in the best mood for a while now but I really didn't mean for her to take it that way. I meant it literally that I would just catch what I missed later on. No biggie.  It makes no difference what I say or do most of the time. I just have this knack at pissing my family off.  It will blow over sooner or later I just wish that things like this wouldn't happen...I guess I will just have to muzzle myself...but even then I will catch flack because of not talking enough...six one way, half dozen the other.  I know that I said it wrong and I know she overeacted...I just wish that wouldn't happen.  Ah well what can I do about it...not much she is already offended and she will take it out on me for a few days.

      Just dropping a line in on the blog so people won't think I'm dead. I just don't have the energy to do a lot of typing and thinking right now.  I have some things to say but I want to get this page updated before I do another taxing post. So I am going to work on the layout (or style) tomorrow and hopefully it will be up and running tomorrow as well.  I am still thinking about getting a private domain and hosting...I just haven't decided what I would do with it all.  Well until later...peace.

      I forgot to tell ya'll what I did the other day when I went out for trouble. Well I went to a movie.  I went to see Man on Fire with Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and Mark Anthony. I will say this now. Washington is a serious contender for another Oscar for this movie, and I would also go out on a limb and say that also filmography or whatever the catagory is that Black Hawk Down won in the film department. This film was not only brilliant...and it most certainly is not the same schlock that just keeps getting pumped out over and over again. I have been thinking about what to say about the movie and first I can say that Dakota Fanning is going to be around for a while because she not only held her own with Washington but also in some cases took the scene and made it hers. I could see a supporting Actress nomination but I doubt the Academy would have the balls.  Walken delivers probably the best monologue that I have heard in a long time. It start with a little banter back and forth between himself (an ex assasin for some sort of government agency) and a Mexican equivalent of an FBI agent. The Agent asks something to the effect of "what did she mean to him", Walken "she showed him how to live again". Walken "you see every man has his art something they are very good at. Creasy's art is death. He...is about to paint his masterpiece." Ok so while it is not the exact lines from the script or movie...it is damn close and frankly dead on. No one but Walken could have delivered that line...no one. Not one single other actor known could have made that line as stunning, chilling, fascinating, and riveting as he did is less than 30 seconds of speaking. If you were to hear that in real live you would shit yourself because the way he delivered it, the line was absolutely perfect, cold, and telling all in one.  So if you get a chance go see it. Warning that some parts are rought...but the rough parts are few and far between...and not shown in great lengthy detail.  One other memorable line that was really good.  Pita (Fanning) : "Creasy. What was the name of your first girlfriend?" Creasy (Washington) : "Nanya" Pita: "Nanya?" Creasy : "Nanya Business now get back to work"  One other note on Man on Fire...much of the music was done by none other than our good old northern boy Trent Reznor of NIN....The stuff he did for this is just mind boggling. As soon as you hear the first few measures you know it is him if you know his former work.  Go buy Underworld as well. Damn fine movie....and Kate just looks hot in Leather and with guns....she could turn me into a vampire anyday.   Grrrooowwwwwlll!  And yes there will be some changes soon. I am working on something here.  Peace

      My friend...B over at  Brassmask.com  and his wife just had their baby about a week and a few days ago.  I can remember when they had just met like it was just yesterday...and now they are a family.   That is the part of time that I do like when it passes when a great pair of people get together, make a life, and then create a life, and I know that they will raise their child with love and enlightenment.   With all the grumbling that I do about things passing me by and life moving every once in a while I get word of news of something wonderful and something that I can look at and just be happy about. This is one of those times.  This update is dedicated to Benjamin. My love out to you and your parents.  Peace

      Ok...it has been well ten days since I last updated and I am sorry.  The last few days that I was in the hospital they had to remove the port in my chest and go back to regular old arm IVs. Well the problem with that is that my arms don't really have good veins anymore due to all the prior IVs that I have had. Really I have maybe, I stress maybe four veins they can hit. The rest...shot. The veins they can hit are all in places that prevents me from using my hands...two on the wrists and two on the underside of the forearms. All of those locations are not ideally suited for typing or using mice...or really anything. Plus on top of it the veins are weak and when you put oh say benadryl into them...it burns the piss out of them. So to get my meds I have to dilute them down greatly and it takes forever and a day to get everything in...so it is incoveniant.   The reason they had to remove my port was because of a persistant fungal infection. I have had so many anti-biotics they have killed off all the good little bacteria on my skin that eat the fungus that we all have. So I got a fungal infection that stuck to the actual rubber in the port and it just wouldn't let go so they ripped it out.  Next time I go in (oh say in a week or two) I hope that my fungal infection will be under control to a point where they can go ahead and put another port in me...because when you need the anti-biotics and all the other things that I get when I am in, you really need to have a port. So hopefully I will get one put back in. If that doesn't happen then I will get a PICC line which is in the arm...it is uncomfortable but it can take a lot of abuse and a lot of meds and it doesn't burn. It is just a pain in the ass.  I did get out of the hospital...on Sunday to be exact. I can honestly say that I don't feel all that well but I don't feel to terrible. I just want a week, maybe two of good times and decent health, and maybe decent sleep. I can dream.  Well I talked to one of my old friends yesterday. She is getting married in September (or Septembre' if French...if I remember correctly). It came as a shocker to me...but hey everything is anymore. I have been left in the brokedown duck lane of lifes highway. I can't swim, I can't waddle, and I sure as hell can't fly...so I just have to watch everything and everyone go by. My sister is done with a Doctoral level degree, my "friends" are mostly done and gone, many on the road to the rest of their lives, while I just sit here sick and not able to move forward. I want to but I can't.  Well enough wallowing for right now...I am going to get cleaned up and do something today. It is a nice day and I am free, white, and over 21...so I can do what I want...well within reason and my credit limit. So off I go to see what kind of trouble I can get into without getting into trouble.  Maybe a movie or two, food...and soon I will be able to get my PA license and then nights out drinking till I'm blind will come...because hey with my liver functions anymore that would be oh say a beer or two...hehehehe...  Off I go...peace out peeps...  Oh and something that I wanted to say that struck me as oxymoronic.  A few weeks back we had the NRA national convention here in Pittsburgh. Vice President Dick was coming into town to speak to some of the attendees. The ironic part of it was that they had security out the ass and all of the attendees had to go through security checks and metal detectors. Now call me silly but this dinner and speaking engagement put on by the NRA was on gun rights and such (I must mention that I am a lifetime member...a gift from a family member and I happen to believe in the Second Ammendment...I believe that you can own a howitzer and as long as you never use it inapropriately and for a crime then go right ahead...but I do also believe that some form of double blind registration should be in place so that you can't locate a person through records but you can tie a person to a gun kinda thing for some measure of accountability). Back to what I was saying being a dinner and speech by the NRA it strikes me funny that they would have metal detectors for all of the "law abiding" people to catch guns. If their was no danger from even this group of normally avid Republican supporters why would they need all that security for the VP.  Very oxymoronic.  Peace.

      Well I pretty much have things straightened out with the laptops. It is taking a bit to become accustomed to the smaller keyboard.  I am also lucky because I got a G-Mail account today. 1GB of online storage. I can get huge emails!   Well I feel like hell because my kidneys hurt like a bitch. If they don't stop hurting soon I am will call the doctor and see what to do. I took some Ibuprofin and they don't hurt as much, but I can't take a lot of it because it can hurt your kidneys.   Well I am off for now.   Peace

      Well tomorrow I have to finish up the laptop game so it is ready for my sis when she comes. I got her a card and will have it on the laptop when she gets here.  Tomorrow I just have to get data off of it and then toss in the restore disk. After the restore disk runs I will then install a full version of Office 2003, Norton Systemworks 2004, Norton Anti-Virus Pro 2004, and Nero 6.3.1.6 (latest version and the version that is working with my DVD burner). Then I will tidy it up and get rid of some of the crap the restore disk will install and make it a little leaner then I will update it and get it ready to walk out the door.  The laptop that I got today is indeed slower but not by much in processing, however I know that I will definitely have to get a RAM upgrade as soon as I can afford it. The graphics subsystem grabs memory from RAM and I have it turned down to just grab 16MB. Once I get more RAM I will let the buffer increase to 64MB. The only problem is that I will have to by a single big stick instead of just adding RAM. The laptop has only one RAM slot and it is used by the RAM that is in it now. Outside of the limited RAM it runs fine. I am surprised at how much the Athlon XP-M fluctuates in speed. It runs from down at 400Mhz when not doing much all the way up too 1.66Ghz when really busy, and it fluctuates fast.  Well I am tired and I am having some sort of acid reflux thing that is making me want to puke...but I am holding it.  Peace

      I have been trying to figure out what I want to do for my sisters graduation. Well I figured it out. I am downgrading. I am going to give her my laptop which will keep her for several years. It is practically new and has plent of horsepower for all she needs to do.  I will get another laptop that suits my needs a little better. The Toshiba is just a little big for me to tote around. It weighs in at around 7 or 8 pounds with the power supply and for me to lug that in and out of the hospital is just getting to be a bit much. I found a good deal on a laptop for around 800 bucks. It is most certainly a downgrade from what I have now. The graphics subsystem is much less (S3 something to the Toshiba's Nvidia FX5200), the hard drive smaller by half (30gb to 60gb), and the processor less powerfull (Athlon XP-M 2000+ 1.67ghz to a Pentium M 1.4ghz...the Pentium M smokes everything in its class), but the big thing is that it weighs in at about 4.5 pounds with power supply. It is much smaller and will be easier to carry with me.  Why would I do it? Because frankly I don't need the power of the bigger system. It will be a good replacement for her giving enough perfomance and durability for a couple of years at least. If I could afford a better system then my own I would get it for her but I can't so I will give her the more powerful system. I have my home computer which is more than enough for gaming when I game (which isn't often anymore) and the smaller system while not suited for games would be enough for what I need and that is surfing the net, writing, and watching DVD's while at the hospital.  Well I am tired and I need some sleep...so I will update some tomorrow...I am going to call my mom and tell her what I am going to do and see what she thinks.  Peace.

      Well good news today...well kinda. I am indeed sick again but not sick enough to go in the hospital. Doc is putting me on some oral antibiotics Cipro and Zithromax. So we will see. I don't react well to Cipro, my mouth gets sores and very raw. It is a painful side effect. I will only be on a ten day course so hopefully I won't get a raw mouth.  I am on the Go list for a double lung transplant. I was talking with Brian online today from  Brassmask . He asked the very questions that I have about all of this hoopla.  The major questions that I have and if I got negative answers before a transplant may influence my decision are. 1. What happens when I fully reject the organs? Do I go back on the transplant list or is this a one shot deal? 2. Will they save some tissue for possible future growth of new perfect lungs once that technology is available?  I have one answer already. They will be saving some tissue for research by one of my docs, but will it be available for making a new set once the technology is available.  As for the other question...I really don't know the answer. The answers to the questions will influence my final decision. However if they call before I have the answers then I will go ahead with transplant and deal with all of that later (although I will ask for additional samples to be preserved).  Am I ready for this all? Not really. I am not fully emotionally ready but I know that if thrust into it I would be ok. It just is something that I have to do.  Well I am tired and I need some sleep.  Peace

      I forgot to mention in other posts that I got my b-day present early this year (as almost every year for the past 6). My mom got me tickets to one of the best comics out there and I can't wait.  I am going to see with my sister none other than George Carlin. He is probably the satirical comic out there. I cannot wait to see what he has ready for the masses in this tour.  My PocketPC was having screen then synching problems that I was able to fix when I opened the puppy up and found a loose cable and a little resistor that had come loose. Once I fixed those problems my PocketPC is all ready for a date. I am going to take it along and hopefully will be able to get a good recording of the show. If it works I will be so happy. If he has CD's there then I will buy a couple (would rather do that).  I am so happy...and even if I am in the hospital (which I probably will) I will drag the IV pole to the show...I ain't missin' it for nothing (short of transplant).  Peace

      So today I was thinkin...yet again about Stem Cell research and the future of medicine in this nation. As I thought more and more I started to get pissed off about what has happened to Stem Cell research and how severely limited it has become in this country as far as government funding is concerned.  One of the first big things that Shrub did when he got into office was to place a ban on harvesting new Stem Cell lines because of the misconception that all Stem Cells come from aborted fetuses. Because Bush is a pro-lifer (which should also mean that he wants to save lives but his other policies show otherwise such as pro death penaly and this horrible war in Iraq) he banned the harvesting of new lines because people are misinformed about the topic. Now I am not as informed as many out there but I do know that you can get Stem Cells from other sources outside of aborted fetuses (although they are the easiest to harvest these cells from).  Quick science lesson. Stem Cells are basically blank slate cells that can develop into any kind of tissue for living animals. Stem cells need only DNA to tell them what to turn into (I don't think the scientists yet know how they know to become lung tissue where the lungs are or kidneys where they are). The promise of these cells is that you can program them to turn into anything that you need grown. They hold very little information from the start...they do contain DNA from the parents of the Stem Cells but that can be extracted or overwritten.  As I said before Pro-Lifers wanted a ban on Stem Cell research altogether because the most common supply would come from aborted fetuses, however you can harvest some cells from the embilical cord right after birth.  The ban at this point only includes retrieving new lines if government grant money is used. These grants basically say that you have to use one of the already existing lines harvested pre-new harvest ban. At the time Shrub gave some number and said that is enough...in reality there are only about a dozen or so viable Stem Cell lines to do research on. So you can see the scope of research will be limited. Outside foundations such as the Hughes Foundation (Howard Hughes) are allowed to harvest new lines at will, but I fear that may come to an end as well.  A Hughes Foundation grantie has already grown new kidney cells from his research on these cells. Pretty soon they will be able to make filters for dialysis machines that use real himan kidneys cells and in doing so they could extend life expectancy on dialysis by years or more. The researcher hopes to soon be able to grow actualy kidneys for transplant within the next ten years. I believe he can do it.  This opens up a realm of possibilities because if he is succesful the research could then be expanded to heart tissue, lung tissue, any type of tissue needed. It also holds promise of being able to make blood at some point (stem cells could even be taught to be blood cells or marrow that creates blood cells).  Again the problem is an image problem nothing more.  We need to change that image and make it human so that John Q. Public can understand and here is how I propose we do it.  We go to old John there and ask him if little Bobby or little Suzy were dieing from some acute illness that effects the heart and their child has maybe at best a few months. Now they will also tell John that their child could be waiting years for a heart to become available but there is this new technology that can get the heart the child needs and put it in without fear of rejection. What do you think any sane or rational person would say? Of course they would want that procedure done.  In bringing it that way and leaving how it is accomplished out of the picture you remove the horrible image of aborted fetuses from their minds.   Now why do I think they need more lines than the few they have now since these cells are so versatile. I think that way because of the diversity of humanity. Lets say there are 7 billion people on the planet and maybe 20 million actual genetic trees (basically huge swaths of people in family tree like structures). In those 20 million or so trees there is great diversity. We only have a sampling of about a dozen of them now maybe not even that many. Down the road we may stumble into a situation where we really need to have that many lines just to get it right or get Stem Cells that develop tissue close enough to transplant without rejection into a patient. They may also find down the line that certain trees develop certain tissues better than others...like Stem Cells out of Arnold Swartzenegger's (sp) tree may be better at growing into muscle tissue and Stem Cell out of Einstein's (or Hawking's) would be better suited for nueral tissues. We don't know and we have already limited ourselves before we even got off the block.  We need the research, we need the additional lines, we need to be at the forefront of this field. If we chose to do that then we could guarantee new jobs and better health.  The possibilities are endless but we must first get over the negative image problem Stem Cell research has.  For the Pro-Lifers' it is better to save something or get something good out of trajedy.  All of this is self serving because for me the issue is clear. I need new lungs. Scientists one day in the future could take DNA from my lungs, fix the CF defect, then grow a new pair for me. This will happen in the next 10-15 years. It would be better to be on the edge of the wave for this or we will loose it to the world.  Think about it...then educate yourselves.  Peace

      I want to continue on the track that I started last night about our environment and the pending changes that are possible.  The biggest problem that scientists have is that they cannot give definite timeframes all they can do is estimate what will happen and when it will happen. The reason they can't say for sure is because this is all new to us. There is no recorded history of how fast or when a huge climate change will occur. They just know what causes it and that it happens.  There are several ways that our planet can be thrown into another ice age. We could have a meteor hit and have what would be essentially a nuclear winter where the sun is blocked out and the planet cools causing an ice age. We could have a nuclear war which would cause the death of probably 99% of the planets living things and then throw the planet into a nuclear winter and result in an ice age. The third way is how we are actually doing it...and frankly we don't know if its happened before or not.  We are pumping out hundreds of million of tons of pollution each year easily. This polution then hangs around causing a thickening of the atmosphere which helps trap heat and warms our planet beyond an optimal temperature. This warming cause the polar caps to melt. We are already seeing that happen greatly. The polar ice is retreating more and more each year basically giving us a warning that something is wrong. The ice caps are the place you go to find out the health of the planet because even the slightest shifts in planet chemistry or balance show up there glaringly. You don't go to New Jersey to get a gauge on how polluted the Earth is, you go to the ice caps.  You ask "how does global warming cause an ice age?". Well it is complicated yet very simple. In our oceans there are vast currents both shallow and deep. Sailors used to use them to get around and that is why for hundreds of years trade routes were pretty much the same because sailors were catching these currents. These currents actually serve more of a purpose than just getting boats around the ocean, they actually help keep the planets climate temperate and the oceans warm. As the polar ice caps melt they infiltrate these currents that are warmer than the surrounding ocean and cool them down. The effect of the cooling is that the currents first begin to shift and if the melting is extensive enough they could possibly stop alltogether. Now you can look at old sailing trade routes from hundreds of years ago. We have pretty good records from that period and they are fairly accurate. Now try and sail then and you will not have the same luck. The trade currents have shifted somewhat. Even if they have shifted a hundred foot you have to realize that a one hundred foot shift of a thing that has been happening for thousands of years is a major deal. To move billions of hectars of water one hundred foot requires huge energy being released. The engine for that energy is the melting ice caps. Not only do we shift currents the water level rises, and can rise drastically rather quickly. Look at Florence Italy. Sure it has always been the city of canals, and it has been sinking at a relatively constant rate for hundreds of years. Now it is sinking faster or so it would seem. Most likely the sinking is still at a constant rate but the water level is actually rising at an every increasing rate.  The currents that are in the sea are much like the jetstream above in the skies. As the jetstream dictates weather, the ocean currents effect the weather of the ocean. As it shifts around and weakens the sea cools. Seeing that 97 percent of the planet is water, what happens when all that water cools? It eventually freezes.  There is a movie coming out this summer called "The Day After Tomorrow". It will show what will happen in graphic detail. You may think it is just movie majic and movie hoopla but scientists have recently found that contrary to what was believed before that ice ages took many hundreds of years to happen and advance ice across land masses. The scientists have found that the changes from temperate climates to ice age climates took but a mear two to five years. In other words as far as geological terms a blink of an eye.  The scary part about all of this is that we are already seeing the changes happening now. El-Nino and La-Nina (I don't have the proper accents at hand) have become much stronger and severe making there presence known. How many people can think back oh say fifty years and honestly say they knew those terms. Now most people have at least heard of them and many can desribe what they are. Well to scientists who study climate and climate shift they are a warning. Hey look here something is wrong. All of a sudden these things actually become a problem. The past few years we have seen much harsher winters than what we have become used to over the past several decades. When global warming first starts sure things get a little warmer but soon the temps drop and become colder.  This year we have really seen the harshness of the new climate that we are facing. Right now in PA it is 50 degrees F. Normally or in the past the temps would be in the mid 70's or low 80's. The climate changes that we will see from now on will be more drastic and dramatic.   This all ties back to ocean health and currents. If the largest percentage of our planet is unhealthy then it is bound to effect the rest of the planet.  Another problem is that we don't know if we even change our ways today that it will make a difference at all. The damage may already be to extensive to avoid the catastophy that we are headed for. The only thing that we can say is that if we change things now we can curb some of the more catastrophic parts of what will happen.  The military was even worried about it enough to write a report on how we should tailor our forces and what conflicts of the future will look like. So it is real. It is not just hippies and tree huggers that think this way. Respected scientists are seeing it, the military is worried, and some companies are making preperations. So the administrations and Republican line that it is voodoo science is crap. The line of science that they buy into is voodoo. They believe that there is a big guy in the sky that will make things all better should we screw it up bad enough, but they don't even believe that we are screwing things up. Conservatives just think they are entitled to 25% of the worlds resources and a huge chunk of the worlds pollution output.  This all has to change. However it has to change from the top and the bottom at the same time. The top needs to lead and the bottom demand so the soft center will have to change and meet the challenge.  I'm spent.

      Tonight I starting thinking more and more as I was driving back from dropping off videos about what this country needs and what Americans need especially seeing that this coming election could very well hold the very future of our nation as we know it at stake...not to mention that the world hinges on what America does environmentally in the next decade (if we even have that much time).  If we stick with the way we have done things in the past and stick with the old ways then the Earth is destined to change. This change will kill a good portion of the population off. Now in reality...and if we keep doing things the way we are doing things then that won't really be a bad thing because if there are less resources then there has to be less population. It is a simple biological and ecological fact.  If we stick with Bush we die...simple as that. He will not change things. If we choose Kerry we still may die...simple as that. The same people that fund Bush fund Kerry. There is no difference, or at least as far as the money is concerned there is no difference.  What is different is the difference in possible environmental and ecological policies between the two. Bush as we know doens't give a flying fuck about the Environment. Most of the so called "good" environmental policies that will "help" are really just corporate give aways that enable companies to polute more while getting tax breaks. The "Clear Skies" Initiative, or so it is called, is really a cover that allows big polluters like coal fired power plants to pollute more. They accomplish this by creating a "credit" system. Each company that wants to pollute gets so many pollution credits (for various things like CO2 and Mercury). They use X number of each credit when they do what they do, like produce power. The problem is that these credits are transferable from company to company. What will happen (and it will even though they say they will have rules to prevent front companies to create bogus credits) is that big polluters will create front companies who's mission is to recieve the credits because they are going to make something, they then make the products but (albeit) efficiently (because remember it is cheaper now to build things to be efficient than inefficient and dirty) the extra pollution credits will then be either transfered or sold to the big polluters like coal power plants who don't really want to upgrade to clean technology. It is a system to replace the current clean air policies.   Hey what is wrong with this system? Well look at it. I could theoretically set up a fake company...or even a real one that produces something. Then I could apply to get the polluter credits. I use 5 of my 50 credits. I then sell the other 45 for millions a year to a polluter. I get free money. Not a bad gig. Now imagine this happening tens of thousands of times over and over again. Big polluters could then collect more than enough credits to not have to worry about how much pollution it pumps out. The main problem with this new system is that there is no total credit cap for the nation. It is not like they are going to say that there are only 1 million credits available per year. If there was a total cap that was lower than what we are producing now (which under old law each year we are supposed to pump out less toxic and harmfull emissions) than the system would work. However the system allows for unlimited polluting as long as you have the money to purchase other peoples pollution credits.  That is one of Bush's policies. So we know that he doesn't give a shit. He is only in it for big polluters who give him millions to run and make these new policies (which by the way don't have to pass through congress because it isn't law...just policy a big distinction). Whenever he either is voted out or gets through both terms (if Americans are stupid enough to vote him back in...hey I'm all American baby I can say we're stupid) he will get large endowments to his "library" which is funny because I am sure the longest book he has read was "Cat in the Hat". So...  Kerry will at least keep the status quo and not do more damage and would roll it back to the old way.  The big problem with Kerry is that he has no vision outside of "anything other than Bush" and frankly being a hoitie toitie he will loose against Bush unless he makes himself different and make a stand for a bigger picture, a big thing, something that will save us in both the real sense, but will save us economically by putting us on the forefront of a new world.  This is what I propose Kerry do. Kerry needs to pull a JFK...as he so often notes that his initials are. He needs to say this and make it his motto.   Hydrogen Powered Economy in ten years.  Then he needs to outline how we get there, and here is how we do it. We are already using genetics and engineering stuff, we put money into it and tell our universities to engineer us an algie that burps out hydrogen instead of oxygen or methane (hell we can even strip hydrogen from methane), but coming directly out as pure hydrogen from these genetically engineered critters. Now I know the "purists" and those who are against genetic engineering would get all up in arms over it all but tell them "come up with a better system and we'll use it". All the mistakes that don't work simply destroy them, the one that does work we keep it locked up so it doesn't spread to the oceans. That takes care of hydrogen. We can do it in ten years.  For hydrogen production we are going to need massive amounts of water. We either convert the massive oil pipelines we have running all over the nation or we build a new system, but we pipe water in out of the oceans. We then clean it and de-salinize it. Not only do you get the fuel for our fuel, but we could also have no shortage of potable water and irrigation water. The salt we take out we use as salt or we add it back to the sea in the correct amounts for the water that will drain back into the sea (seeing that there will be greater water runoff to the sea.  So in this vision we not only get off of oil but we innovate and create jobs at the same time.  If Kerry does that then guess what...he may have a chance. He has to think big...not just for the presidency but for the world. He needs it, we need it, and the world needs it.  I hope he has the balls. Only two people in this race had this vision or something similar and had the balls to fight for it. Kucinich which he is a great man and Dean, who while isn't really a huge environmentalist he is a doctor and is educated well enough to know that we have to do it...not because it would be environmental...but because we have to. To keep on living we have to change our ways.  Until next time...Peace

      Well my sister and I went to dinner with my mother and grandfather. Let me just put it this way. He is a two dimensional character not all that unlike Fred Flinstone. The difference is that he swears, is racist, smokes like a chimney, and is in the advanced stages of kidnay failure but still drinks like a fish and then heads out for a nice drive in his Town Car.  We went to this place that I hate because the food is overpriced and the service is shitty, and they have lounge singers. I have a fixed amount of energy for each day. I was worn out within minutes of being there.  One thing that happens is everytime I am driving with my mother and sister together I end up lost. Where this place is I don't know my way around. I got there fine with just my sister. When it was her and my mom with me driving shit just fucks up. My mother had said something about parts of the highway shutting down. I heard her say it during dinner but paid no mind because she said nothing when we stopped at a donut shop for some coffee for my sister. So I go to go back the way I came...on the highway. Well the way I need to go ends up being closed down. So I have to get onto the proper highway by going up an exit then planned on turning around. Well if I had turned around the traffic was detoured back to almost where we started. I ended up taking some bumwood road and it was a sheer guess as to where it lead...but we got to the detour route to get back on the highway. Now mind you this is my moms neck of the woods but she doesn't know North from South and got me turned the wrong way heading the opposite direction until I see a sign that told me we were headed the wrong way.  Now I love my mother...but she has a poor sense of direction. You could give her a map, a compass, and a GPS unit with NAV points programmed in and she would still go the wrong way. She thinks and acts like she knows, but she hasn't a clue. Fortunately this time I was doing the thinking and we didn't end up lost in some suburban hell like the last time she was "navigating". The last time the three of us ended up going thirty miles out of the way to get back home because she thought she knew where she was. I know better now and pay more attention to my compass and keen sense of direction (and photographic memory...if I drive it once it will always be in my head).  I have a lot of Indiana PAs area roads memorized. I can get from Indiana to Greensburg without using major highways, and from Greensburg to Latrobe using a highway for about three miles...the rest is back roads that a friend showed me.  I can navigate most of North Mississippi above Batesville without using major highways...I often thought that if ever in a car chase I could simply loose the cops because I was so familiar with all of the service, dirt, minor, and dinky roads in MS. I had it to the point where I could blast down them at speeds that would seem suicidal if you didn't know the roads and where you were going. I have tried for this area and I am getting better at it...but west of Pittsburgh is a mystery to me until Robinson Town Center...  So I am going to bed and I am going to sleep as much as possible.  Goodnight...I am working on more stuff to rant about...I am sure I will come up with something soon.

      I wanted to say something else about religious zealots and right wing nutters like Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell. They are all pretty strictly anti-homosexual and are pretty homophobic on top of it all. Now I ask Rush and I doubt he would answer, if he were stacked in a naked man pyramid and had pictures taken and then distributed do you think he would be embarrased? Well it may happen...and I hope it does. I hope they convict his fat ass and he ends up a prison bitch because he already is a little bitch...well a big fat little bitch.  The problem with the left is that it does have way to many pansies in it. For years it has been weak in down to earth, salt of the earth language speaking people. Well not only am I intelligent but I can say fuck with the best of them and wrap sentences and misinformation that they spew around and hang them with it all. In other words I filled with such rage towards these cowards who pick on little people that I would have no compunction about getting in their faces and confronting them with the facts and numbers (if someone would compile them for me) and tell them that they are fucking liars. Call them out. Not in a funny Al Franken way (which is amusing but to deal with pigs you have to get dirty and root around with them). I would not take the "moral and intellectual" high ground. Instead I would spew the same venom back at them only with the truth from the numbers...and I wouldn't stop at the right wing pieces of shit either. I would call out the left wing pussies who have for to long tried to appease and make nice with these vile humans that deserve prison treatment no better than what Saddam afforded to his prisoners.   Fuck principles and moral decensy. These people have stolen the political landscape and molded it for their own gain and political raping.  I love Amy Goodwin, I think that Al Franken is marvelous, but unfortunately these people cannot reach the masses. Not because they are to left wing or boring but because they speak a different language. It is the language of reasonable and intelligent people. They don't speak NASCAR dad speech. I understand them and frankly anyone who gave them an honest listen would be amazed that they can understand what these people are saying, but in the world of venom spewing vipers like Limbaugh and his ilk you have to do the same. Not to be like him, but to beat him at his own game. We can't make them play our game, and reasonably we shouldn't have to play their game, but face it people it is time we start and we get good at it. There is no reason why smart people can't beat these idiots at this. We can do it better. Once we have won then we change the tone. Then we shift the country left or at least more center.  I advocate an all out attack on these people. If we can't play their game or we can't break into it then we break the game. All of these morons use technology they don't understand. Technology that peace loving people invented. Technology that smart people know how to manipulate. If we can't get into the game we shut it down. We take it off the air. If we can't play then there can be no game.  We need to have a multi front war on these people and their ideas. We can beat them if we put our minds to it. We can beat them on their own turf, and if they won't let us play on their fields then we pave their fields over and take the game away. We invented it, we gave it to them, we can take it back.  Call it the biggest Indian Give in the history of the US. (no offense to native americans...in my world you would have you land and nation inside ours if you so chose).  So Peace...and if that doesn't work then all out war. They are rich and fat and out of shape...we are poor and hungry and lean...we know what it is to struggle and fight. One or two good black eyes and they will back down like the pansies they are!  Well fuck me swingin' (thank you Russell Crow for that saying) where did that come from?

      I may have gotten myself kicked off of the CF mailing list today that I suscribe to because I simply cannot be an optimist and I must put before people the simple fact that under the current administration it doesn't matter what disease you have they want you to die. That is the simplest explanation that I can come up with. Harsh? Yes, but not as harsh as what they are doing to so many people.  People with cancer, alzheimers, cf, and most of all the inherited and even other diseases are being denied the best research by the government because of a moral opposition to stem cell research and a fiscal allergy to spending money on actually helping people instead of killing people.  Again this is all self serving because I need for billions of dollars of public funds to be spent on stem cell and genetic research. I need that money so that I can live longer (even though I don't have much that I really want to do outside of DANCE!...no write if I ever get my shit together and actually write down where I collect my info...I just hate documenting stuff, not research, but documenting because I love reading but not writing out all that crap).  Well I made it through today and made out with a couple of cards, a balloon, pretzels, swedish fish, an ice cream cake (I don't eat cake but my sister loves cakes and ice cream...she got it for "me" but it was nice and it tasted good so I am thankful). My mom got me Carlin tickets for Saturday (I have already mentioned them) and my sister is going to get me Scary Movie 3 tomorrow (they were out of it today). So that was my B-Day...not bad and thankfully it was small and I didn't have to expend a lot of energy on excitement. Last year I had a big bash (along with my sisters b-day) and it was very taxing because I was sick, on meds, and just had my leash put on at that point (glad that is over!). I had to expend a lot of energy on being chipper and I didn't want for people to think I was ungreatful because I was...so I am glad that this year it was much less involved and only my family.  Quarter plus two, two more than I thought, five years to the median, waiting for lungs, and average wait of two years. I have about 40% of my lungs left at a burn rate of 20% this last year...and it increases as time goes on. I am in for a rough time but I can handle it whatever it is. Not because I am that good...but because I just don't ever do anything like I am supposed too...so I will trudge on and blow the bell.  Peace

      Well my doggie had his balls removed today finally. My sister took him down to the place where she did an externship in Cheswick and did the deed. He had one dropped and one in his abdomen. It was a hard surgery for Rufus because they have to cut him open and dig for the testicle. It is ok though he has pain meds. She also took Xrays of his hips to see how bad they are...and they are pretty bad. She figures about a year at most before something has to be done, but it could be as short as 6 months. So I will have him at most another year and that makes me sad cause I love my dog. We could replace the hips but it is a huge surgery and is a lot of pain for the dog and I cannot put him through it. I wouldn't want it I would rather be put down.  It sounds ruthless but I see it as humane. I may cry I may not but I know I will have done the right thing because it will relieve his suffering.  Well I am staying up with him because he is pretty gimpy and because of the invasiveness of this surgery (I couldn't imagine hip surgery) he is pretty gimpy and I just want to keep an eye on him cause he is my baby.  Well off to get him his pain med for the night.  Peace

      Well today I had a lung transplant support/informational meeting. It was really depressing for me to go to.  First off I am glad I took my notebook because the computer the docs had there to use wouldn't recognize the USB flash drive the speaker had...it was an older Dell model with Windows 98 on it so it would't run without the proper drivers. So the laptop came in handy.  The information I recieved was really a bummer. First out of the thousand or so patients that came in for evaluation for transplant only about 48% percent were accepted. I am through that phase.  There are a bunch of other numbers as well but it boils down to that only 13% of the original thousand make it through transplant.  CF patients have about a 48% transplant rate in all. If I had a different, less virilant lung disease I would have a much greater chance of making it through it all.   It is just a little depressing. I know that I have as good a chance as anyone but the numbers are daunting and frightening.  Well tonights discourse is about Social Security and the push by people on both sides of the isle, as well as many banker lobbiests', to privatize Social Security and its benefits.  Now the rational is that the private market can make more money for the retirees in the stock market or even the most conservative of money market accounts. Yes it is true that if a person were to take the equal amount of money that Social Security witholds from the paycheck and put into a money market or riskier stock fund that person may make more money than what the returns would be on just the straight payment to the SS system. However there are two problems to that whole way of looking at it.  First is that Social Security was never intended to be a retirees sole income but it has become a safety net for many many people. The deposits that many workers make into the system really have no value. Sure you can go look up potential benefits that you may get it really isn't there. You cannot reliably calculate annual percentage returns on Social Security because of how it works. If when you retire you have substantial savings or holdings of value your SS benefit will be less, the less you have the greater your benefit will be. It has very little to do with what you put into the system. However you are guaranteed to get out of the system more than what you put it. Who know the total "percentage return" you will see but it is nice to know that you will have something.  The second big problem even larger than the first is that if you invest money you had better be prepared to loose it. Investing is almost as risky as gambling. In a casino if you have a large bank roll and play blackjack you have about an equal chance of walking out with at least as much money as you walk in with. Playing the stock market is like taking 100 bucks and hitting the poker tables. Sure you may win a lot of money, but more than likely you will loose money. The stock market is for the rich. If you have tons of money you can diversify and hedge your bets (investments) and you will always be ahead. If you are a small player then you will probably break even in the end, but the risk is great that you could loose it all. Look at the stock market bubble the burst in 01'. How many people lost everything. Tons...if it weren't for SS for some of those people who did all the right things (saved, invested, and are frugal in retirement) lost their savings and now rely on SS just to buy food.  Now the bankers and investment firms would love to get a hold of the literally trillions of dollars worth of SS money. It would be trillions because they would have to transfer people who have been paying for years but aren't retired to these new accounts, plus all of the people currently paying in and new workers each year. For the government to privatize it all would cost the taxpayers trillions.  Now for the real reason why they want to privatize the whole Social Security system. Or at least this is what I see. All of the ultra rich have vast holdings. Much of it in the stock markets. This money is tied up, if they were to start selling off these vast holdings it would drive the stock prices down, hence driving what they can get out of the stocks down, thus leaving them less wealthy then they were before. Laws of supply and demand work here. Their very own motto and creed kicks in free market economics. If there is a huge supply and little demand the prices are low, if there is a large demand and small supply the prices remain stable or rise. Over the past years the stock market hasn't performed as well as many would like so some legitimately want to get out and save their money, but imagine what would happen if say Bill Gates said that he was going to sell all of his Microsoft shares off. The price of Microsoft shares would drop, not because the company is unsound or bad, but because the market will be flooded with openly available shares of Microsoft (think about it now as a bidding war...20 million shares available we'll say, 18 million owned, 2 million floating around, and someone outside of the 2 million wants to sell 1 million shares...price drops slightly).  Now what will all these people do with the money they would be able to take out of the stock market if public money (social security savings accounts as Shrub would say) became available. They would move to good ole' commodities. The rich are both smart and dumb. In the near future there will be famine and drought (we are seeing it now in its begining phase) and if you own commodities like wheat or corn not only does your wealth grow but you also own so much of this or that. With that you can go and get it physically to feed your family. You can eat wheat and corn, you can't eat stocks.  Another problem is that these "savings accounts" won't be insured so if someone screws up and your money vanishes (as it tends to do on wall street) you have no recourse. Since there will no longer be Social Security as we know it you don't get anything. It is a play to get the poor mans money and give it to the rich man. If they get this infusion of cash many wealthy people will cash out of the stock market and many others will simply steal the money as we have seen at Enron or Tyco, and many others.  The "experts" say that we need to do it now. The system is broken! It will crumble tomorrow. Well even they admit the system will be able to pay out until 2042 at current growth rates and that Social Security will remain solvent until then. With minor tweaks it will work until 207?. The main tweak is that people who make over 88 thousand a year pay more in SS tax. That is the big thing about SS right now a person who make 79,999 dollars a year pays the same as a person who make 4 million a year. So as you go lower on the pay scale the percentage of income paid to the system goes up, and the more you are paid the lower the percentage you pay into the system. Bill Gates pays that same amount of Social Security Tax as a person who make 88 thousand a year, yet he is paid far more money. The tweaks would extend the number upwards a little. What is unfair is that Bill Gates will be able to draw Social Security of some amount and will get something similar to my grandmother per month yet he hold vastly more in property and stocks than she does...but he will still get the same money. She has paid more of her wages in percentage over her lifetime than Bill has percentage wise. The Social Security system is really the poor helping the poor and the rich riding the poor for more cash as well. Social Security is run on the backs of the poor...but to privatize it would mean its demise and you will only be able to be able to afford Social Security because it will no longer be an entitlement. You will have to be able to afford to retire and afford to be part of the Social Security system if it changes.  So when politico's come before you and say "the social security system is broken! it costs to much, we need to raise the retirement age, and if we don't privatize it the system will fail". Just reply "BULLSHIT!" The Social Security Administration is the most efficient according to Jim Hightower with only 1 percent overhead. There is no investment house or bank that has lower overhead. So don't kill a system that works already...and will continue to work for some time.  Think...plan...act.  Fight the power, buck the trend, be smart and confuse the leaders, use their words and studies to make them look like the fools they are.  Peace

      I want to appologize to some people out there for not having kept in touch lately. It is not that I am being totaly anti-social it is because I just don't feel much like talking lately mainly because I am constantly bothered by a group of head people over this pending transplant. By the time I get done with dealing with them all I am all talked out and just ready to collapse.  That is also another point. I don't feel much like talking because I am worn out and I get short of breath when I talk to long (like more than 5 minutes...yes it is getting that bad). Unless I get fired up about something and then I can talk for a long time and after I finish I pass out for a few hours. I sleep constantly and I am still pretty tired all the time. People tell me to sleep less and I will have more energy. Well I tried that for a week (slept 8 hours a night) and by the end of the week I was sicker than when I started the week and I ended up having to catch up on more sleep...causing the vicious cycle to go round again.   I am not ignoring people...I am just not talking to anyone. Not because I am don't want too but because in many cases I can't.   Later this morning I have a "support group" for lung transplant people. I don't want to go but I need too so that I can meet more of the transplant team.  So until later...peace.  And by the way the best way to get me is not on AIM but email...I am on AIM only occasionally...rather around my computer when messages come in. Email I check five times a day religiously and that is the best way to get me. For some people I don't have your email addies so email me and I can get back at ya!  Night all

      This new interface is really K-Rad.  Well I said that I had more to write about and really it is more of a rant about health care and the military.  If you add for the past century in this nation alone you would probably come up with 100 trillion in todays dollars that have been spent on researching and aquiring weapons. We have literally figured out a thousand ways to Sunday to kill people. Now if you add up the money spent on health care in the public sector (remember all military research and spending is on public money ultimately...Boeing develops a new missile and sell it to the US all of the costs are passed on to the Gov.) anyway you add up all the public money spent on research and implementing these life saving ideas it would probably be less than a tenth of the money spent on the military. To me that is uterly insane.  We spend all this money on killing each other and we are right in the middle of a health care crisis. We have superbugs being made each day through the use (and overuse) or antibiotics. Instead of investing in new meds for healing our pharmicuticals are spending tens or hundreds of millions on penis pills. Don't get me wrong I love my dick...but when it comes down to it would I rather have a better antibiotic or stiffy...I'll take the antibiotic.   Sure money is being spent on good research but it is not enough. Public money has all but stopped to help develop drugs. All of the current life saving drugs were developed years ago on the public dime in Universities then turned over to private companies in the hopes that they would not only develop the current class of drugs but also future drugs at the same pace. Well the pace has fallen off. We have hundreds of new drugs a year however many of them are not life saving drugs more like life enhancing drugs.  Meanwhile the military needs more armor, needs more bullets. I am for a strong defensive military, but what have is not a defensive military. It is an offensive army. It can't defend anything, it can only attack. We have seen it in Iraq. The military was great at the war part and invasion because they have the tools to do that, but in the peace and defense of Iraq it has failed uterly. Canada has a defensive military. Sure they can attack but the majority of their military is defensive in nature. Our military is never in the country to defend. It is always elsewhere. We need a strong defensive military but not this monster we have now. A B2 Stealth bomber is not a defensive piece of hardware, it is for attacking nations secretly. Nuclear weapons may have had some defensive position at one time in a MAD (mutually assured destruction) scenario but we can't use them now. If we were invaded by Mexico its not like we can drop a few on Brownsville TX to stem the invasion. They are for attacking another nation. They serve no defensive purpose whatsoever. If you look and take into account the size and configuration of our military it is very easy to come to the conclusion that it is only for attacking and empire building...not defense. Department of Defense my ass...the old title would be much more appropriate The War Department. That is what it is simple. A Department of Defense would never keep a military as large and aggressive as what we have, a War Department would.  That brings me to my next point. We are failing at all the things people are saying we are doing. If we are bringing peace and democracy to other oppressed nations like Iraq as the Administration would have us believe then we are failing. If we are empire building as most of the rest of the world says we are doing then we are also failing because all of our "colonies" are in revolution already. They all want us out. Sure the Romans, British, French, Spannish, Germans all suffered from the same problems we now suffer in building our empire they at least had a few years of peace (more peace the further back you go in time...things happen faster now due to better communications).   So anyway we look at it we are failing on all fronts. So instead of wasting lives and money we might as well pull back and evaluate what is going on. The world will not fall into some evil hands if we leave it alone. Many would argue we are the evil hands because of what we do, how we do it, and then how we empose it on others. We have failed and we might as well face it.   Bring all of our troops from around the world home. De-activate 80% of the military and change its configuration to a defensive posture only. Concentrate on creating the technology to make our nation cleaner and better. Finally we need to spend money on figuring out and making people healthy. Healthy people are happy people.  That is what the rich have still not figured out after all these years. If you keep the people happy and healthy then they work harder and do not revolt. When will they figure that out. Who knows? But if they don't Americans will revolt and bring the nation back to where it is supposed to be.  Peace...  I have another one in me for another day...as always thanks for reading and if you have any suggestions email me and let me know.

      Wow...blogger has changed how you enter a post. I likes!  Well today I was surfin the channels and came across a Chomsky speech from somewhere. It was recent, I want to say in March or April. He said exactly what I have been saying for months now to my family and I may have mentioned...actually I know I have mentioned here.  While the reason for invading Iraq seems as simple as getting our hands on Iraqi oil for our use it is a tad more complicated...and I firmly believe in what I am going to write here.  The real reason I feel is because most of the middle eastern fossil fuel reserves actually go to Europe or rather the EU. There are three large players in the world right now and frankly they will probably be that way for some time. I am talking mostly economically but also militarily.   You have of coarse the US and North America (USA, Canada, Mexico) and together we are a large economic block and with the USA in this block we also happen to be the strongest militarily at this point. The second power is most of Asia or the Asian nations. China, North/South Korea, Japan, and then Sub-Asia (Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and many others). The third region is the EU. Both the EU and the Asian nations combined are much larger than we are and combined they are militarily stronger than North America (or as Michael Moore would put it "The Big One").  Asia is pretty much self contained. They have vast resources at their fingertips and they keep tight control over it all. They have huge populations that can afford armies of tens of millions. They also have something else we often forget. They have technology that is on par with our own because most of our technology is built there. We invent it (not so true anymore) and they build it. If they ever decided to exersize their power we would be helpless unless we wanted to destroy the world with Nukes. Also China owns huge chunks of our national debt. When our government issue bonds it is like a loan from someone (an investor) to the nation, at the end of the term the nation then has to repay the loan plus interest (however many people roll their bonds into new ones). The largest buyer lately has been China. They are able to do this because of the huge trade balance deficit we run with them. With the billions in difference that we see now that money goes into buying US bonds. So essentially China could call the debt tomorrow and we would probably not be able to pay it. Asia again has vast resources there. So they could isolate themselves and be fine because most of their materials they need are already there.  This leaves the EU, particularly France and Germany. They both have the largest economies in the EU. Brittian is third and not a full member of the EU (they still haven't gotten rid of their pound for the Euro). However the EU must import most of its energy resources and they come out of the mideast and have for some time. Whoever holds the mideast holds their economies and can crush them if they were inclined to do so.  Sure we need oil, but we still get most of it from here or South America (hell we even import from Canada!). Only some of it comes from the mid-east.  With our hands on the tap we can turn it off anytime we want. That is also why we are in most of the Caspian Sea nations to control the natural resources. Not so much to bring here but to keep others from reaching full economic and military power, or rather to become a threat to the US.  Chomsky of course put it better...but I am not as learned as he is, but these ideas truly have been bouncing around in my head after I saw a map somewhere of where we are in the world militarily. It so happends where we are all happens to coincide with where oil or gas or coal deposits are.  When I told my grandmother about Chomsky's speech she said "hey you have been going on and on about that for a long time". My reply was well at least I am not the only one who sees this trend or patern and if Chomsky sees it as well then I may not be to far off base as to the thinking I aspire to do.  She also suggest that I write something about it all and submit it. I told her its not that I don't enjoy to read but I hate to research because I research by grabbing bits of info here and there and cataloging them in my head then stringing them together how a Capitalist would and then put a twist on it. The sad part is my predictions have been pretty close so far as to what is happening. I would write for real if I could ever remember to keep pen and pad handy so that I can get quotes or write down sources and notes. Again I am lazy about that.  Within a day or so I will write what I think of our "defensive military" and health. I will also talk about our noble goals of Democracy and spreading the love...and how we have failed at every angle you can look at it (including emperialism).  Well Peace...my sis will be here tomorrow and I have to clean a room for her to sleep in.

      My sisters new laptop is nearly done and almost ready for her. It is finishing updating now downstairs close to the access point.  Goodnight...I'm spent and my kidneys hurt worse now. Alas doctors are in bed and I get to suffer for a few more days. If it doesn't straighten itself out in a few days (I have drank almost a full bottle of cranberry juice to flush them out of any toxins possibly built up) then I will get a hold of the docs...but not until after Carlin on the 11th. Tuesday baby!!!! Then Thursday I turn a quarter century plus two. Longer than I thought or planned for.  I'm out!

      I now have audio blogging as well...and I will say my voice sounds kind of girlie...I hate that. I always get on the phone "yes ma'am" and shit like that.  I would pay attention to it from time to time because I talk to myself a lot and now that I can record it for posterity sakes I will be recording a lot I figure...so tune in from time to time.   I tend to bounce "crazy" ideas off of my brain and see how it goes. It may interest you in how I think.  I would like to thank Blogger.com for all these great services. I not only get a free blog, but also the audio blogging now, and also I got my 1 gig gmail account because of being a longer standing blogger person.  Of you don't have a blog get one...really it is cathardic in many ways. Gmail may seem harmful because they scan email but really they do it robotically and no person reads it...and frankly I have nothing to hide so scan the email bitches!   My life is an open book...and I am sure that the audio blog portion will come in handy when I spend time in the hospital because it will be easier to do...  Remember! PEACE!  So much tonight...damn!

      Well today has been a long ass day. I spent most of it seeing my sister off, visiting, and then just spending time out of the house.   I got my license the other day so now I can go drinking which is a good thing. I went and got a couple bottles of whine and a bottle of Absolute Vodka...I have drank about half a bottle of red whine and half a bottle of white, now I will get a little vodka in me.  Tomorrow hopefully will be easy. I am going to try and catch up with some friends. I am definitely going out to a bar tomorrow night.  I figure what the hell...I need it. I need to get out and have a little fun. Might as well because who knows how long much longer good time I have left, might as well spend it having some fun.  Heard something interesting today. It seems the Justice Scalia's son was a lawyer for Bush when he sued to stop the vote recount in Florida so he should have recused himself. Also Justice Thomas's wife was a consultant for the Bush campaign that was gathering information for staff positions and appointments for Bush and his administration while the whole recount thing was going on, he should have recused himself as well. With those two justices recused the count would have been 4-3 in favor of letting the recount go on and that would have given Gore the victory.  It sickens me worse each day as I learn about new things that this administration has done and is looking to do. Each day I become a little more convinced that anyone willing to vote for Bush again has a serious mental disorder.  Peace

      Well I made it through today with no fever until a bit ago. It is mild and not bad.  I got my birth certificate and MS Department of Licensing and Public safety drivers record clearance so I was able to go get my PA drivers license...even with my wild hair! Something bit me on the nose the other day and the end of it is all scabbed up on one side and I was thinking "oh great I am gonna look like shit on my photo"...well the picture is a great one, one of the better photos I have ever had of myself anywhere. Usually license photos are horrible...but this one is good. I had my head slightly turned and you can't really see the huge chunk of nose missing. I am pleased with it, and now that I have a valid ID (I had a valid MS drivers license but I didn't physically have it...or have it for almost two years!) I went to the liqour store and got a couple of bottles of whine for tonights dinner with grandpa. I picked good bottles too!  So now I can go drink without a hassle!!! w00t!  Well I am going to watch Aqua Teen Hungerforce and then hit the sack..  peace

      Nothing to report today outside of that a shell was exploded over in Iraq that seems to have some sort of Nerve Gas in it. The gas was old and fairly weak it would seem as none of our soldiers has been reported to be having serious effects from it.  WMD's seem at the moment to have been found in Iraq, this must make Bush pleased. I feel however that in a good analysis of the toxin they will find that it is old and was likely to have been produced pre-1990 as the potency was very low.  I was hoping that no WMDs would be found but now that one has been discovered I hope that no more are detonated for the sake of our troops and for the sake of the civilians because if a truely potent WMD was detonated then there could be many casualties. That is the last thing our troops need to deal with on top of explosives. It will now be infinitely harder for our troops and much more hazardess because of this discovery. It will raise the "terror" factor with our troops because now they have to be worried about being gassed.  As I have stated previously on this blog and in real life I still feel that any weapons that may be uncovered will most likely be old weapons with little potency. I do not believe that they had active and productive programs. If they did then someone was selling it to them, and that someone will definitely lead back to us when it washes out.  If we find many weapons and evidence that a full fledged program was in effect that was producing weapons then I will eat crow and admit that they had it. However I want to make sure that we are safe and that the zeal to find weapons and programs will not overshadow reality.  Regardless of the outcome on WMDs the war was still not justified as there are no apparent ties to terrorism or orginizations that have targeted us. Again if we can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt then I will eat crow. I will however diffuse one possible piece of "proof" in the training camp that was known to be in Northern Iraq. We knew it was there for a long time and because of where it was located it fell under our protection in the no fly zones so Saddam could not have actually destroyed the camp...even if he had marched some military up there we would have bombed it. Also the fact remains that the military had requested several times to destroy it and three seperate times to kill Al-Zarqowi yet the approval was never given by the Bush Administration (which leads me to believe even more so than ever that he is a CIA asset or that they need a boogy man in Iraq).  Goodnight...and I send my thoughts out to our troops. I hope that we bring you home soon because you don't deserve to be over there fighting for economic and corporate interests that have little to do with national security. There are people here fighting to bring you home safely and soon.  Peace

      Ok todays update will be short and sweet. I hope.  My sis, mum, and I went to see Troy. Go see it. Not a bad epic. Pitt was very good in it and Peter O'toole was excellent and may see a nod for it. Pitt may also see a nod but it will be on the back of one scene between him and O'toole. It is a big movie and a long one, and a much better movie then Van Helsing (although I love Kate Bekinsale...I might bear a child for her...hehehe).  I caught my Insult-A-Day calender up today and read it for the days I missed which included my birthday and it is like a prophecy for me. It makes me even more determined to become one of those people who speak out and spread the truth as best I can.   Here was the insult.  "A toothache of a man." - Radio Host (and former Secretary of Agriculture in Texas? I think) Jim Hightower on George H.W. Bush  My calling may have come to me from an insult a day calender. Either it is destiny or pathetic. Either way I'm goin' big or goin' home.   Night all.

      Well I went to see Carlin and damn was it good. I took the PDA but it just wasn't having anything close to recording all of the set.  I just want to say that is really was worth all the walking up and down steps that I had to do. He had great new material and starts the show out with a bang.  I am pretty tired from it all and I am still processing much of it...but this tour has less political satire than I was expecting. Seeing that there is so much cannon fodder right now I would think that he would have a lot of political stuff going on. This isn't the case but he does put Bush down twice and the second time it is "he lays his big fat empty head on his little pillow". There is a story behind it but it really is pretty funny.  Just got this in...take it with a grain of salt as with everything on the interweb...but the AP picked up the story it seems.  Rummy may have authorized the torture after all with the presidents knowledge.   Well that hit me up pretty good.  It is sad when we as Americans think and act like we have the moral high ground yet we are the ones killing and torturing on a scale that far exceeds what the so called "animals" in Iraq are and have done to us. Falujah...I am sure we killed not only a few true targets that were shooting at our men, but we killed hundreds if not thousands of women and children. The argument that has been made is that they had the chance to turn in the insurgents or leave the city. Well first many weren't allowed to go because their husbands couldn't leave...and last time I checked it is still a male dominated society over there so women can't really travel without men. Ok so back to the horror of it all. Second did many of our founding people turn in Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and others? Nope...why? Because they were revolutionaries. They were the insurgents of their day. No matter what we do or how we do it we will be kicked out of Iraq. No nation or empire on the face of the planet has been able to hold the middle east. Every nation or empire that tried was driven out by the local peoples, including the local Jewish people. (A dirty little secret is that before Israel was a state the Jews and Arabs that inhabited Palestine lived in relative peace outside of the occasional squable over goats drinking from the wrong part of the stream or eating in the wrong field. Only after Israel became a state and started expelling the local Arabs or Palestinians is when all hell started to break loose. The other Arab nations didn't help matters much because they propugated the myth that Jewish settlers would wholesale slaughter palestinians and that they should run or kill every jew they saw. Well that led to more violence. Also since the time of Muhammed the keys to the church or temple or mosque in Jerusilem, a religious site for all middle eastern religions including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the keys were entrusted to a Muslim family that there sole purpose was to make sure that the site remained open to all faiths and that the site was clean and protected. Muhammed foresight actually protected the site from the invading armies of Europe during the crusades because they were burning villages that wouldn't convert to catholisism. So they burned jew and muslim alike. Both groups fought side by side albeit contentiously but fought the European crusaders. The family to my knowledge still has the keys and still is in charge...it may have changed after Israel took Gaza and the West Bank which includes Jerusilem. But it was the Muslims who protected and kept up the most sacred sights for Jews and Christians alike because Islam was and still has hope of being a religion of peace.)  Again we cannot win in Iraq. We have already lost. The thing that we must do now is find a way to retreat and let the most stable power come to power without looking like we placed him in power. Sistani may be the answer...let him "beat" the United States and feel his oats. That is fine. As long as he promises not to wholesale slaughter other factions and have some sort of representative government as part of our "surrender" or "cease fire" treaty. The only thing we can do is pull out strategically and hope that the region settles into some sort of stable peace.   So we must pull out...otherwise we risk the attitude that started breeding (and it is starting even earlier this time) like that of Vietnam were we supposedly can't loose or the region will fall apart and become this huge communist domino and more nations will fall after that. Well it fell yes...but not to many fell after it. Now the region is seeing modest but steady economic gains and the people aren't attempting to export anything but local goods. For the the communist system has helped move them out of tribal and clan like systems that even the French were unable to do. It may have been through ruthless re-education but that doesn't concern us and doesn't affect me at all. So why should we have been concerned.  Iraq is a strategic asset, but only if we can completely control it and we can't. If we continue and fight harder and harsher then it will galvenize the Arab nations against us. They hate us now, but soon they will despise us and when that happens you will see people from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Iran, and Iraq come together and fight us as they have always done with past invaders. It won't be radicals that will be fighting us...as the powers that be will say. It will be average people who just want us out. It is already happening in Iraq and soon it will spread. That is what the politicos should be worried that the domino effect will be cause by our continued presence instead of our leaving the region both militarily but also economically. When we leave the region will have some upheaval as power bases shift but it will settle out quickly. If we don't leave soon we will end up fighting every Arab nation and incurring tens of thousands of deaths on our side militarily and increase the risk for civilian deaths here at home in terrorism, not to mention the millions that we will kill in retribution.  We can save a lot of money and a lot of blood if we admit failure and pull out now. Pulling out is a great American tradition, only this time it is sure to work because we will remove the substance that is giving the enemy all of its gas to fuel the fires of hatred.  Peace

      Played again tonight...although so far a lot less eventfull.  I was mistaken in my thoughts the other night that I had banged most of the good looking women here in PA. I found a few tonight that matched well.  I have this problem...it is called "no game". I am a severely stricken person. When even the worst are spittin' there best I am still only at "shutes and ladders" (mispelled on purpose that time). I really have no game. I would imagine that it would be like a young Noam Chomsky (my hero) trying to pick up women. It just ain't happenin' outside of a classroom setting with me being the teacher (and then it might be a felony).   It takes a few sittings for me to warm up to people. I have just this impulse of that I hate people but I am amused by them and therefor need to be around them (plus when you drink alone you are an alcoholic...as I sip a glass of fine wine...really I am!).   I need a good looking woman with some brains to keep me even remotely interested. For me at this point it is hard to find (and chances are I won't find her in a bar).   I want a relationship but I don't. I can't, from my altruistic and rational side, see putting anyone through all the shit that will happen over the next months or years. On the other hand I would love to have someone to lean on from time to time when I am feeling blue (and of course the sex!).  I am watching Fight Club and Cloe is saying she wants to get laid for the last time...that is how I feel right about now.  I dunno what I want but I know I will probably not find it. I want closeness without the pain that goes with it. I want to be close to a woman for all the carnal reasons without the pain that will come with my passing. I know that I am going to die, sooner rather than later, but I still want someone there, yet I cannot bring myself to put anyone through that.  I am on this CF mailing list and many of them are in relationships and I cannot understand why for the life of me. I cannot understand why someone would want to put another completely unrelated person through the pain of this disgusting disease.  I need a "Marla" in my life...someone who doesn't give a fuck, a person who has realized the futility of it all, and yet has enough panache to live life (I used panache)...I know that person is out there...but I don't know if I will find her in time.  Peace

      I wanted to say oops...I didn't update last night...there is a reason, Goldschlager, beer, and loud music all played a role in causing me to pass the fuck out and at points see parts of my stomach and bowel expelled into a trash can (thank god for plastics!).  I will be paying for a bit but that is ok...I needed it.  I will update with something a little more interesting later today...after I get some sleep, clean my car (it is truly filthy!!!), and get some more alcohol in me because it is Memorial Day Weekend baby!!!  My deepest and greatest admiration and respect goes out to all of the men and women who have served this nation with honor and respect, and to all those who have died in the name of freedom on whatever battlefield. I salute you and I hope for a swift return home for the troops that are now deployed.  Peace

      So I was going to wait and let things settle in my head and then put them to words but I couldn't wait any longer.  Tonight my mother and I were talking over dinner and she said that I was rude in my defence of Arabs and intimated that I was mislead in my sympathies to their ways and way of life. She said that I was the same as Nick Berg who went there obstensively to bring new thought and that it would be my undoing as it was his.  I am not a Nick Berg. Actaully I feel that Arabs are barbarians much of the time and their capacity for barbaric actions is almost limitless. Many of their actions shock me and disgust me in many ways, but at the same time the actions that westerners and especially we Americans have done are just as shocking if not more so. Let me explain.  We go places to bring peace and unity and a new way of life under the banner of democracy. The problem is we rarely practice it here as it was meant to be practiced by our founders. Had they been able to foresee what we would do in the name of our way of life they would have most likely been opposed to it and probably would have written into our constitution and civil liberty documents specific measures to keep us from doing what is blatently obvious today.  We went to Iraq under the pretence that Iraqi WMD's were an iminant threat to the US as well as suposed ties between Saddam and true terrorists that target us. A WMD has been found and there are sure to be others as well, however it is likely that these weapons are old and not as big a threat as they once were (being less potent), and they were never a threat to the United States because of sheer distance. Saddam held malice towards us as most Arab states do but not because they just hate us for hates sake, they hate us because of actions we have taken or actions we have sponsored in the region.  The fact is that we have been medling in middle eastern politics for over fifty years with little success. We put into place horrible regimes that killed many people and we looked the other way as long as those regimes remained friendly to us, as soon as they turned on us all of a sudden they were a problem, but not before. Iraq, Iran both prime examples of shit we did to piss off the local populations.  The big difference between them and us is that they accept death and welcome it in many ways because the afterlife is sure to be better than the current one. Suicide is a time honored tradition for them (or so it would seem) and what they fight for is perfectly legitimate, their methods are not though.  I rail against the notion or idea that they just hate us and hate our way of life. Sure they see us as decadent, but so do our own fundamentalists here in this nation.  Islam is no different from Christianity or Judaism in that all three religions require conversion or death, but also all three religions have a loving god figure.  While many would love for this to be about religion (and for many on all sides it is) this is simply a war of failed policy on all sides.  The scary part is that we intiated the failed policies and we are still doing them today in other countries. The more we fail the harder it becomes on us.  We cannot underestimate how bad things are going to get, not from just Arabs, but also South Americans and much of the rest of the world. All of the worlds anger seems to be aimed at the United States. Not so much the people but the government that has done so many misdeeds in our name.  Every tax dollar that is used to buy weapons, support dictators, and send death overseas will be revisited on us in ways that will literally tear us apart.  To get out of this mess we have gotten ourselves into over the last century will not be easy, and we would be niave to think that even if we changed tomorrow that terrist acts would stop here. Instead we will see more of them and they would taper off over time. We can fix it but it does not stop the orphans that were made by US bombs, it does not ease the grief stricken mothers and fathers of lands that have been devistated by our policies. The thing we can hope for and change is that we no longer create more of these people.

      Well I did more damage to the body tonight. Went and sat in a smokey cellar and listened to deafeningly loud music while sipping some hooch. Oh was it good. I have enjoyed going out and having a bit of fun from time to time. Unfortunately this may have been the last night I can do it in a while unless whatever is brewing starts to behave again.  Not much happened today but I have to give a big "ups" to the Pope. I am not a big fan of Catholisism but I do actually admire this pope because he has remained pretty steady throughout his time as pope. I have to give it to him for admonishing Bush and this war. When the pope is against you...damn.  A good bit that is coming out of the Catholic church lately is that they seem to be cleaning house out in Boston and here in Pittsburgh they are seeking people who were molested so that they can remove priests and take the appropriate actions. While many (and a younger me) would call for excommunication I do not feel that would be appropriate simply because the church and the teachings bear out forgiveness in God's eye...but it does not mean that I approve or think it is right and that the church should do everything short of that including seeking legal reperations against these rogue priests. Again I do not think kindly of the "fondling" priests I feel that the church and people should forgive if they truly believe the teachings of Christ. Remember if you subscribe to the teachings these men will have to answer for what they have done.  That is all for tonight....  Oh by the way there were a couple of females there that were smokin'. Damn I wish I had game.  Peace

      Well tomorrow I will going to see my friend Danielle it is her birthday. I am very excited about this because I have been wondering how she is doing and it seems that she is doing well.  Another CIA dude quit today...although this resignation has been planned. I think that Tennet's was planned for a while because they need a fall guy and he makes a good one.  I feel kinda crappy because I have something big brewing in my lungs and I know it for sure. First all of the stuff coming out is green...and I mean green. The second is that I have hives a lot which means something is going out of balance somewhere. The third reason is because I am sleeping a lot lately. I mean a lot because again something is out of whack.  Well my grandmothers student the ever beautiful Cara. She is back for the summer and let me tell you that if I were a little younger and in better shape that I would go chasing her through the weeds so fast.  Peace.

       CIA Tenent resigns.   I am happy that it has happened but this is an obvious falling on the sword. It doesn't get shrub out of the crossfire.   The snake Chalabi said he was glad Tenent was gone and that Tenent was the source of the misleading information also that Tenent has it in for him. Well Chalabi...you sir are retarded. Many of us remember that you and your I.N.C. were the source for much of the faulty information and it doesn't change the fact that you are a thief.   It looks like these dudes are sitting in a barrel of gasoline and ole Bush is lighting a match.  hehehehehehe...  Peace

      Ok I finally found Howard Stern's site. I looked a while back and couldn't find it. Now I have.  Regardless of if you think he is a mysonganist pig you have to defend even his right to free speech. I will say however that I love to listen to him because he has no censor in his head...he is probably the most honest radio host on the air because he has no agenda outside of shock and he is able to say what many think. Unfortunately he is under attack from all fronts and really it is all for nothing. Plus he hates Bush (not bush)...I am glad that we have him and I readily support him.  He may say obscene things from time to time but it is not the states job to keep things clean...it is up to the parents.  Go Howard! Get this...he is a conservative on many fronts as I am. He is a constitutionalist as I see myself, yet has a progressive attitude towards many things.  Remember he is pretty well off in the end...Bush's tax cuts help him yet he sees something wrong with it although he still says he likes the tax cut.  Peace

      Well today the President was reported to be seeking outside council on the whole Valerie Plaime thing...the CIA agent that was exposed by someone in the administration. Bush could be called to testify and most likely he knows how did it. It was one of three people I am betting Cheney, Rove, or Bush himself.  We will see how that one shakes out. I must say CBS is really hitting the stride now. They also reported yesterday on the Enron tapes and again today more was revealed.   Hmmm what else. Oh yeah Bush denied having talk with Chalabi and said he didn't know him well although Chalabi sat behind his wife at this years State of The Union and was the handpicked leader at first for the CPA council. Like he thinks the rest of us are stupid.   It is just all very silly how they are trying to get out of all the shit they did. If it turns out that Chalabi was working for the Iranians as well and one of the higher ups spilled the intelligence bean on knowing how to decode Iranian intelligence than that may be high treason. Treason is punishable by death...so if these people are so pro-death penalty then Rove may have to see the gas chamber or see the needle...because we must remember that Rove is the nucleus of this warm little moist chewy administration and everything that happens inside the White House Rove knows about and probably had a lot to do with moving pieces around the board.  I hope that we nail these people and break the neo-con back for good...or at least for now.  Peace

      Well things are falling apart in the Administration even faster now. While many have know what is going on and saying over and over again to seemingly deaf ears we may this time have caught them with their pants down.  We have to remember that these people aren't smatter than many of the people they rule. These are business people and business people are not intellectuals by trade. Engineers, scientists, historians, language professors are, but not business people.  Business people essentially are the ruling class they don't know how things work but they are supposed to know how to manage and sell things. This administration has been pretty good at selling to people here in America as many fell for the lies. Again though they are not bright people, but are smart enough to attempt to control the flow of information (which this administration has done well admitedly), sooner or later those in the lower tiers of power get their toes stepped on and that is when we have leaks and new information come out. That is what has happened here with this administration over and over again.  The administration has consistently tried to marginalize even Republican darlings like O'Neile. He is not a good guy, he never claimed to be one, but he does realize that you can't just lie like they do and get away with it forever. Generals who have four stars have come out against many of the policies, not because they don't want or like war, but because the administration stepped on their toes. The administration attempted to manage the government without much knowledge of what it does or how it does it. When you try to manage without having enough knowledge of how to work a system you find bad managers at all levels that have been appointed, and the people they piss off won't stand by forever and watch their hard work go to waste regardless of what it is from great big bombs that go boom, to a frog specialist at the EPA who is fighting a company that wants to dump waste in an area that will kill all the frogs (I know of now direct case...it is just a point).  Sure the administration brought in some smart people (very few mind you) but they didn't listen to them and when those people weren't listened to they left and now they are talking about what they advised. Remember these are people they picked so if you choose to believe in the administration then you have to believe their appointees.  Instead of listening to these people they have instead chosen to block the flow of information in every way they can and when something does get out they attack it (all of the radical right) and say it is "sour grapes" or make it out like the person has a political agenda. Sure some do but most again were appointees that Bush and Cheney tapped for these jobs.  The information being leaked out in general is done by good honest hard working Americans within the government because what they see as wrong they believe the people have at least the right to know. Many have given up careers and put themselves into the fire for this and instead of praising them many Americans simply choose to ignore them just on the administrations word.  I have no doubt that much is politisized in these days, but it always has been from Kennedy to Bush 2. Another thing to remember is that these people who are in charge are the same group out of the Reagan administration who helped fun the Iran/Contra deals, killed tens of thousands or more in Central America by supporting dictators as bad or worse than Hussein, and indeed supported Hussein himself even know he was a menace. These men are liars of the worst kind because their lies get innocent people killed en-masse. Not only have we lost 800 troops of our own there is little doubt that about 10,000 Iraqi's have been also killed. These men lie to kill, kill to lie, and then hand the bill to the taxpayer and then say "we are doing great" all the while the Nation is falling apart because of budget shortfalls.  I have resisted the idea to Impeach Bush because while we know he lied about many things the lies can be manipulated to a point where it was misinformation. If this latest bit about Enron and the tapes leads to the administration then I say it is time we start the impeachment process because of their deeds and high crimes. Treason it is not but it is certainly worse than Whitewater or even Watergate.  Peace

      Today CBS reported on some Enron tapes that show that there was market manipulation in California.   Linky link...   These tapes have been in the custody of the Department of Justice and were witheld from the public by both the Administration and the Department of Justice. I wonder who would such a thing. Maybe Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft and other oil men?  Well it also is going to get Arnold in trouble as well because it was reported a while ago and I put here last year that Arnold had made a deal with Enron reps to settle the lawsuits that California had launched to recover about 6-10 billion dollars from Enron because of price gouging. Arnold agreed that once he took office the lawsuits would be settled and prosecution would stop for a settlement of just mere millions. In exchange he got great support from the energy lobby and recieved money as well.  In 2000 Enron gave millions to Bush/Cheney/Republicans for the election all the while fleecing the California consumer. In return they got a President that witheld federal oversight into the market manipulations and also held the line and would not impose price caps of energy. In this climate Enron was able to do what it did.  The roosters are coming home and it looks like they are shitting on Bush's desk this time.  Ahh the sweet irony of being right :-)  Peace

      Well I went to see my dad off and then to see "The Day After Tomorrow". I will say that it is indeed a pretty damn good movie. We will see however a trotting out of "scientists" that will say the science is hokey. Well taken as a whole it may seem a little hokey until you break it down like I did.  First the shelf of ice that breaks off. There is currently a very large chunk of Antarctica that has broken off or is in the process of breaking off and will soon be the largest iceburg that has been recorded in modern times. It is huge. Once that much ice melts into the ocean it is sure to cause a slight cooling because it will drift and melt. Once it melts the ocean will cool maybe a degree or so and also change the salinity of the ocean. Again these changes will be slight in human terms.  The ocean currents that I have spoken of before do indeed exist and we do have the knowledge of if you shift these currents you will cool the ocean and thus the planet also cooling the air temps.  Here is the big if question. Scientists don't know how much ocean cooling or salinity shift will cause these currents to shift or stop all together. But we do know something will happen but not the extent.  We know that changing paterns in the air flows and masses change our weather paterns. We know it because we can now see it pretty clearly. If the jetstream is changed drastically (or even slightly for all we know) we will see many problems. Tornadoes in Hollywood, blizzards in New Delhi. We just don't know. But we do know that the Gulfstream (ocean current) is linked with the Jetstream somehow.  Also we know for fact that melting ice raises water levels and we have seen the ocean slightly rise (and it is rising at ever increasing rates) over the past years.   Ok so now comes the hokey science. Or the part that can be passed of as hokey but hopefully I can convince a few people that it is probable. The Ice Age that starts in hours, days, or even a few months.  We know it is possible. It has happened in the past. We have wooly mamouths that were frozen in place with food in their mouths and stomachs as if they were eating and then flash frozen. It is possible and it has already happened. It happened about ten thousand (10,000) years ago. A blink of a geological eye. This is where the movie kind of makes up some science...well sort of.  The make the case that the shifting and eventual stopping of the Gulfstream effects the Jetstream while the water level is rising. As the Jetstream changes huge storms start to form similar to hurricanes only they form over the northern land masses toward the north pole. I think that the storms would be effected by the season in some way as to where they will form but that is my opinion. If the northern hemisphere is in fall winter and the southern is spring summer then the storms form north and vice versa.   These huge storms reach the troposphere where the air is very very cold. Those storms happen now but they are small and the air that is sucked down as it is in a hurricane is warmed as it reaches the surface by water and air because it is over the water. Over land there is only air to warm it. A small storm would cause cooling of a few degrees. A large storm over land would suck down to much air at a time and allow it to not warm in the surrounding air. It would be a -150F blast of air to the ground. That would flash freeze almost anything and anyone.  We know hurricanes do this and that is how they form and get strength along with warm water. Warm water, cold air and you get hurricanes. Well over land we don't know for sure and that is where the movie really speculates.  However seeing that it has happened before it is plausible that it will happen again and we will be the cause of it. It was cause before by a buildup of greenhouse gasses that took tens of thousands of years to do naturally through volcanoes and other things. This time we have volcanoes and the rampant burning of fossil fuels that only adds to the problem.  Now we can dismiss it all as hokey science but it will only be hokey till it happens. I believe it will happen.  As was made evident over and over again in the movie there is no timetable we can follow because we didn't really record it the last time it happened. This time we will.  You can slowly warm a frog in a bucket of water until he boils without him jumping out. When you toss a frog into boiling water he will try to jump out.  I believe the water is already boiling but because we are all so used to these slight changes we will only see that the water is boiling around us when things actually freeze.  Go watch the movie...it is impressive and entertaining all at once...and the science if you dig into it a bit isn't far off at all.  Peace.

      Finally I will be able to add some pics easily to my blog. Thanks Kates! Anyways I have some pics on my laptop and camera that I wan't to put up...also a couple on my phone. I have pics of my sis (who I am so proud of now that she is a practicing vetrinarian) and my family. Now I can post them easily. Only a few more things and my blog will be put together to my liking (mainly adding some links and a full profile of myself).  Well I am going to get some sleep. I have to get up in a bit to call my dad and possibly meet with him before he flies home, plus I wanna go to a movie.  Peace.

      So I ended up in the hospital at 4:30 yesterday (Sunday) morning because I had an ongoing allergic reaction to something. I woke up Sunday and my lip was very swollen due to some allergy. I had taken about 150 mg of benadryl throughout the day and it just continued on to hives then swelling in my neck and throat to the point I lost my voice for three hours or so.  It turns out to be some freak thing that I have had happen in the past but in the past I was able to stave it off with benadryl, it was a little different this time because it didn't respond. They gave me 125 mg of solumedrol and IV zantac. It brought the itching down but the hives were still there. It is all pretty much done I am still a bit itchy but at least the hive are gone for now.  Outside of that not much is going on. I am going to try and see "The Day After Tomorrow" later today (I almost said tomorrow). I am also going to look for a little film called "Saved" or something like that. It is a film about a Christian School that Falwell was just on CNN blasting even though he admitted he hadn't seen the movie.  As much as I can remember about my times in Christian schools I always found they were filled with horrid children and teachers. We went because my parents had just moved to the area and heard the public school were bad. Well the christian schools were worse because they tended to collect those who had been thrown out of public schools and those who's parents were rich sent their spoiled children to school. You had the worst of both socio-economic classes...and that always ends bad if you are in the middle of it all.  I wanna say a little about the evil that is Jerry Fallwell. He is an evil horrid man that if there is a "god" I would hope that "god" will send him straight to hell because of what he preaches. He plainly preaches hate. There is nothing christian about his views outside of him framing himself as a christian. He is a neo-nazi'ish bastard of the evangelical movement. He has capitalized on the fears of what I feel are mostly good people. I do not agree with most evangelicals because they teach what is essentially no different from what the Taliban or right wing of any religion teaches. Convert or die and go to hell. The difference basically for the evangelicals is that they are mostly here (with the exception of those in Africa and they do what I am about to describe) and don't have the opportunity at killing people who don't.  In Africa, the Middle East, and many parts of second and third world nations religious radicals or extremists do go around beheading and raping villages. We constantly talk about how the radical religious extremists, and many times comentators don't even bother to differentiate them form normal muslims. We talk about how horrible they are and how truely disgusting the acts that the extremists do when they burn some people or behead a person. It is no different from what happens in many other nations with and equal ratio of christian to muslim atrocities. With extremists in both camps constantly going back and forth killing literally thousands of people.  Extremists always go to the most extreme that a population will tolerate, that is what makes them extremists. If the extremists could get away with killing people here we would see a lot more often. We would see more Tim McVeys, we would see more serial killers. We would also see more religious extremists killing people off. It happens elsewhere, the only reason it doesn't happen here is because it is not acceptable. Many of us are just run of the mill people that do not acsribe to the extremists of any religion or political view and when we see those people we tend to wince and turn our heads.   On that note I will say that we have seen a marked shift in politics and religion in this nation towards more radical conservatism (which actually means bigger government and more wars) and more fundamentalist religious views. In moving that direction we have seen a degredation of intelectualism. The religious right come out in droves to fight anyone who questions their ideals or puts to task any of their teachings on history whether ancient or recent. That has been largely seen as acceptable and many mainstream christians have fallen prey to those extremists because it is framed as attacks of christianity and their ideals. When all that is asked is whether or not the historical accounts are correct when they are posed by "christian leaders".   Mainstream christians, jews, and muslims need to drive these fundamentalists out of their ranks because those are the people that drive wedges between the moderates and always (always as in throughout history) drives those same moderates to war. It is always the moderates who suffer at the hands of extremists because by the time the moderates are driven into war it is because the extremists have come to power. The extremists are therefor through position protected from being one of those who have to fight. You can see it here right now. Ask any of the right wing hawks of the republican wing (or hawks of the democratic party) if they would be willing to fight or send their children as front line troops. The universally known answer is no. Instead they send pretty much moderate americans to go fight for their extremist views.  All I ask is that we move back towards education and to hold that educating and intellectualism isn't a bad thing. We see week in and week out what football or baseball and basketball teams do at tournaments and in games yet we hear only once a year about some great students who have nothing to do with sports. We have university sports programs that have many of their students attending on partial or full scholarships, yet an english department may have only one or two students who get scholarships if lucky. As long as we reward the lack of intellectualism we will continue to see the nation move to the right. The greatest period of enlightenment in this nation of recent times came during the 60's. Not that we had a lot of great things but we had artists, thinkers, scholars who came out of this period and thrived during it as well. We saw some of the greatest laws passed during this period and many programs that have been overall good for the republic. Yet many people look back on it and think "those damn hippies". Well out of those hippies we had many of the greatest artists and thinkers of recent history. It all came to us via a educational culture that had influence at the time. Many kids were forced into college because of Vietnam and out of that we ended up getting excellent engineers and technology that has changed the world. While it is true we have more college students as percentage now than then the difference is that at that point in time students were encouraged to be students and thinkers and were not looked down on for being such. Now you go to college and you are looked down on in class by others if you attempt to be good at what you are doing. When you do well you are then expected to help others cheat by those who are poor students by them sitting next to you and copying (I have had that happen many times...I get a 90 or better on a test and everyone around me would get the same score!).  We just need to promote thinking again...unfortunately we need to see it from the top and right now the top is a C average student and someone who proclaims proudly that he doesn't read often. If you don't read you don't know...do they draw cartoons like they did for Reagan (they actually did do cartoons for him so he could learn about a weapon system as claimed by Dr. Helen Cladicut who was the only no-nuke advocate to meet with him and she summed him up as being of low IQ...she is a doc so I believe her...she is a pediatrician).  We need educated people who are willing to stand up and be educated and then spread the idea that the fundamentalists are anti-intellectual and therefor should be dismissed as uneducated.

      I wanted to write something else and it took me until now to remember...how pleasant.  My mom and I get into what I would call heated debates or talks over Bush, Reagan, the Republican neo-cons, and the radical right, not to mention religions.  She has often expressed her dismay that I am so disallusioned and so negative against my country. In some sense I am negative against our nation...but not so much the people or the physical land, but our government.  I do talk negatively against it and I talk negatively against many of my fellow Americans who are not educated as to what is going on, and I really dispise the people who don't know and don't care because those are likely the people helping to make matters worse for the rest of us.  I have railed against many of the actions that we have undertaken especially since 1980. As I become more informed about things the more I am enraged that people allowed it to happen. That adults of this nation supported these actions either directly through voting for the leaders or through inaction by not caring at all.  My basic ideal, what I think we get right in all the wrong things that happen are the few acts of blind kindness that do actually happen. The recent mudslides and floods in Haiti where our military flew fresh water and supplies to the people, when we sent tons and tons of aid to Iran after the devastating earthquake last year. Those are acts of blind kindness. I don't consider foreign aid as acts of kindness because it always has some sort of caveat attached. When we send that kind of aid it usually is required that the aid money be spent here to get the goods to ship over there. Why can't those government spend the aid inside their own nation or in a closer nation on goods that are produced locally. That kind of aid actually would drive economies in those aid nations and help them out of the situation and build allies without restrictions. The fact is that you can get wheat cheaper in other nations where it is needed than you can if you buy it from us.   I see a real disconnect between the rhetoric and the actions of this nation over and over again despite the fact that most of the people here really do mean well. We spend 400 billion on our military to fight against imaginary foes. Our military is simply designed to go toe to toe with other militaries, not against nationless drifters.   I often think what would happen if we dropped bread or supplies instead of bombs. We bomb places back into the stoneage then we bring aid and expect the locals to say "our hero!" when we come rolling in. In reality we usually bombed them out of their sustinance living and thus making them reliant on our aid.  I look at all humans as whicked, horrible beings. I hate all of my fellow humans. The reason is because any human has the ability to become a Saddam or Uday, but they also have the capacity to become the Dhali Laama. The problem I have with our government is that we support the creation of the horrible people instead of supporting the development of the good people. The development of bad people is easy because we do it everyday, it is much more difficult to create or grow good people because it means that we have to set aside personal differences and motives. We have to set aside our drive to have more than others, instead it means that we have to work with people and be willing to share the pie with the other 5.7 billion people on this planet.  So change the world. It really is that simple. We just need to give up our primitive drive to have more stuff than the rest of the world. It should be quality over quantity.  Peace

      Well the hair is now purplish..I had a lot of blue left and only a little purple so I mixed the two and the resulting color looks a lot more purple than anything. I have to wait about 30 minutes then I can wash it out and see the results.   This is probably my favorite thing to do...I love changing my hair color to many shades just for the hell of it all.  I am going to try posting pics again and hopefully it will all work out...if it does I will post the purple hair and the toenail of power.  Peace

      The service I use for posting pictures is acting up. Well rather the software that is used with it is having some problems. I really want to put up that huge toenail for all the world to see. "Behold the power of the toenail!"  I am still working on my Reagan rant...millions dead, tripling the defecit, economic policies that still haunt us today, AIDs "they deserved it" epidemic, and the law that required troops to pay for meals when in the hospital because no one in that administration could add or do basic accounting (law was signed in 1981...yeah republicans love the service men and women...see deficits), and just so many other things.  People have been saying a lot that Reagan will be judged as a good president by the future. I hope that the future likes facts better than our current society who instead loves believing that we are great. History would hopefully be well read enough to say that he was a horrible president who presided over many wrongs. History will judge alright, but only if we have a future to judge from.  The biggest thing that offends me is that the right wants to put him on the ten dollar bill and they want to build a monument to him on the National Mall, and they want his face on Rushmore. If they get any of it through, especially the Ten spot I will not use them. I will use only fives and explain to people why I don't have tens. Because Reagan was horrible.  We can find fault in almost all of our leaders throughout time, but Reagan is recent and he ultimately was the person responsible for the terrorism hoopla that we are living with now. The root, the seed, stems from his administration and the people who ran it, and the same men run the government now. So it looks like the people will be the ones screwed for years and years. Not only did those people get richer at the expense of the rest of the nation and the world, but they also managed to help create the radical muslim movement that haunts us today. What a crack bunch of fuckers.  Peace

      I didn't get the pics of the huge nail up yet but I will.  I wish I had something in me to write. I am going to work up a Reagan piece here soon. It won't be nice because he was a horrible leader with horrible ideas. He was a simple man with below average IQ according to Dr. Caldicot. So I am sure it will be easy together a hell of a piece on him.  Peace

      I finally was able to dig out this nagging ingrown portion of a toenail. I am so happy! My foot feels sleak and sexy, much more aerodynamic and lighter. It has taken three months to get to it!   Bwahahahahahaha! Behold the ingrown toenail!  I will have pics up of it later :-)  Peace

      I want to stress how much I love to hear Chomsky on topics. Everytime I hear him it is like music to my ears because of how knowledgeable he is on so much.  I would like to ask that people forward me any and all links that they come across for speeches he has made. I would love video, but just audio would be ok as well. I will probably start another page that has just Noam Chomsky links. So help me out here folks. I am going to start getting it ready here soon because he really is great to listen to his musings on what is going on.  If you can get a copy of the Video/Movie/Documentary of "Manufacturing Consent" I would say do it. If you can find it I would be willing to send out a few copies to people as long as they agree to send out copies of it as well. So if you are interested then let me know and I will send out a few.  Peace  Essentially I want to create a Chomsky media library. I have the disk space, the DVD burner, and plenty of DVD's and CD's so I can get stuff together. I think it would be great inspiration to those who want to learn about ourselves and what we can do to change things.

       Cities react to Patriot Act.   I have been watching a series on Free Speech TV called "Water The Drop of Life". It is a good series and I would recommend it for some educational watching.  I thought I had a Doctors appointment later today but I don't it isn't until the 16th. I hope I make it that long but the good news is that if I stay out the extra week I will definitely showing the signs of the infection I know I have so they won't argue over a hospital stay. It sounds nutter for me to stay out the extra week but it is really for the best because then I can get a new port and all and just get the drugs I need instead of dicking around with oral meds.  Reagan has been dead since Saturday and the media blitz of his "excellent presidency" is really wearing. I will be glad when it is over.  Peace  Off to surf the news.

      I don't know what all to write because not much has happened.  Well a few things happened. I am refinancing my car for a hell of a lot less per month. It will only cost me 150.90 a month for it now. I can actually pay it off in about a year and a half. Once I do that I am going to save for a bit then I will probably trade it in and get a newer vehicle that is either 1. more fun for the fuel economy or 2. much more fuel efficient.  If I could find a true sports car for around 10-15 thousand (like a Vette 00-01 model) I would get it. Otherwise I will look into a smaller sportier car that is more efficient. I want something sporty and efficient if I can't get a Vette. Probably will get a small two door...unless I find a hell of a deal on a hybrid.  Well I think that will be all.  Peace  PS Is anyone else tired of Reagan shit? I am.

      I don't know what all to write tonight I am pretty much at a loss. I went back and read through a few of my old posts and all I can see are the errors. Spelling and others.  This whole Reagan thing is out of hand. He was loved and loathed. He was good and bad. He was alive and is now dead. I will not attack the man because he is dead but I will attack the policies and the ideas because they were wrong in many cases.  So with that I will be heading to bed or something...  Peace  Oh yeah...I will dig up a few more pictures to put up and I will get with the audio blogging :-)

      I wanted to drop a quick note before I head to bed. I went to Danielle's birthday/transplant party and she really looks great. She is having troubles and things aren't perfect by any means, mostly other things CF related that are getting to her, but it looks like the lungs are ok so far and that is the best anyone could hope for at all. I sat there and talked with her and Joel (Joe...J something), and we talked and talked and talked. It was nice to sit with people who are in the same sinking boat. Joe (l) is in the best shape right now out of the three of us, Danielle and I tie for second/third, she has new lungs that work but guts that aren't real well and my lungs are heading down the shitter and my guts still work ok...pain she certainly has far more than I do...so I have nothing to complaign about at all...although my pain is getting past the 6000mg of daily aspirin, tylonol level (yes I take that much). 2000mg two to three times a day depending on pain. It would be easier to take pain meds but really I haven't the energy to fight for them at this point. Plus I figure I will doped up soon enough.  Well I will leave it at that...I am just glad that I had a great time...and I got to hang out with people my own age, and I met some really nice people (and a few odd ducks as well).  Peace  Oh yeah Ronald Reagan died today. While I mourn his passing as I do any person, and it is a day of sorrow for our nation. We all must remember that his proposals and his budgets (with help from congress) ran up huge deficits, was responsible for at least several million dead from military actions he supported around the world, presided over the spread of AIDs and said "they deserve it", and managed to run many cities into the slums through decreasing federal tax dollars (it all went to "Star Wars"...loved the film hated the policy). Again it is a day of sorrow, but also a day to not forget all of the man...the good and bad. Rest in Peace Gipper.

      Right now as I sit here contemplating my navel and watching "Duplex". So far it is pretty funny.  I to Danielle the other evening and we just had a merry old chat. It was nice. I am getting more of my story written and so far it looks like comic gold.  There is so much that I have to get out onto paper and maybe just maybe I will get them all down on paper or on the computer. It will be interesting and fun.  Peace

      They changed out my big ole feeding tube for a button. It hurt like a mother fucker getting the tube out. The dude just grabbed a hold of and yanked it out, as a result now the incision is bleeding. This was the same fucktard that said my feeding tube wasn't infected or having any problems. It just fucking hurt...and if hurts still.  I am going to try and get a nap.  Peace

      Ok so I hate PICC lines. They hurt like a bitch going in and they are inconvenient as well as a pain in the ass because it limits mobility.  I just hope we can get everything straightened out quickly with meds and all because I need benadryl and if I am going to be couped up I will need something for my damn hips (I take 3000mg of Tylonol three times a day for it).  Well we will see.  I just hate all this mess. Now the numbing is coming off the PICC line insertion point (right now it is only a half hour old) and it is hurting a lot!  Peace

      Well as you can see below I finally got my picture service to work properly and you now have the TOENAIL OF POWER!!!!  I also got all the kinks worked out of my SprintPCS connection and got some software to work for my phone finally.  Later today I have a doctors appointment and as of right now I think there is a good infection in there. Last time I thought that I was wrong...but hey this time it feels a bit different and most definitely there is something growing like a little weed in there.  I talked today with the counselor for the transplant center. She asked a bunch of questions and is sending out a packet for me to get started with. When she asked how I deal with stress I was seriously tempted to say "I run puppies over with a lawnmower" but thought better of it. No I would never do that.   What kind of question is that? Really can someone tell me? There are two types of people, those who get stressed and those who don't. If you get stressed you fall into one of two catagories. You either cope and deal or you don't.  First I rarely get stressed about things. I have found it is a waste of time and energy to stress about things that are ultimately out of my control so why worry. When I do get stressed I just tend to shrug most things off to fellow human stupidity.   Fuck it...ya know. Just don't let shit get to you. You either have control or you don't and if you do then do the best you can and be happy with that. Look you can't be right all the time, you can't be perfect, and you sure as hell can't please everyone, so fuck it. Do your own thing to the best of your ability and enjoy it. Do what you love, love what you do. It is a simple philosophy.  When things get really bad I go for a drive...because I have at least partial control over what is going on.  Well that is it for the evening. Enjoy the toenail...I sure did. The little fucker was in my damn toe for months and months.  Peace

      Went to see saved today. The best way that I can put it is if you are a good christian, in other words not a fundamentalist then you would get it, if you weren't then you would be offended. Culken was great in it.  Not much else to report. We did have a hell of a storm that knocked power out to the theatre but it was soon restored.  Peace

      Up late yet again. All of my parts hurt, my brain aches, and my mind is numb.  Looks as if we are going to have a gully washer here so it will be nice. Maybe the bird shit will get washed off my car.  I am writing again. I think I have box office gold on my hands...really grade A classic box office gold. It came to me when my mom and I were walking to the movie theatre from the chinese place we ate the other night. These young girls passed us by and it was like a pack of small dogs yipping at each other and they were no further than five foot in front of us when I said out loud "I really fear for our future"...it spun out from there.  I will leave people with this tidbit...it will be one part that will be a takeoff of the WWJD bracelets, only it will be "What Would Jessica Do?"...as in Jessica Simpson.  Really it will be box office gold.  Peace

      Went to see Riddic...or however it spelled. Decent movie, story choppy, slow middle, awesome fight scenes, Diesel good action star, leaves room for sequels or prequels. However go see it at a matinee price, certainly not worth 8 or 9 bucks to see.  Also watched for the first time "The Last Samurai"...definitely an excellent movie. See it if you haven't. Very well done, great performances, and show the beauty in other cultures. Visually stunning movie and an excellent story. Worth the rental for most, a must buy for some.  Peace

      Bush left the country today for Ireland and then Turkey. Last night I saw an interview that he had with an Irish reporter for Irish TV. She was a tough questioner, probably giving Bush his first real questions that he had no script to answer.  At one point Bush said that most of Europe was behind the US and the war in Iraq. She looked at him as if he had just run over kittens with a lawnmower. The truth is that overwhelmingly Europeans were against us and this war. Even in the nations that supported us like Spain, Italy, and England, the majority of the people in those nations were against the war. Although their "representative" governments failed in listening to their people and took their orders from Crawford TX.  The interview offended me in that our President, elected, appointed, whatever you want to call him it doesn't change the fact that he was rude to this woman. I wish that someone would have just slapped him across the mouth because of his behavior.  I mentioned that last night but I forgot to add in the crap with Cheney. He told Sen. Lehey to "go fuck yourself" on the senate floor. There are rules in the Senate and profanity is prohibited. What was kind of funny was a Republican backed morality bill that effectively quadrupled fines for indecent things played or said on the radio or tv. The same day Cheney is telling his opponents to fuck off.  Now normally that wouldn't bother me all that much. Actually I wish our politicians cursed more and yelled more often at each other. It would certainly liven things up a bit.  As I said normally it wouldn't get me upset but this did. A few months back Kerry was interviewed for Rolling Stone and said something to the effect of "I didn't think he'd fuck it up this badly" in reference to his vote to authorize Bush to declare war. When it was printed immediately the right wing whackos came out all over and the chief of staff for the White House called for Kerry to immediately apologize for using that kind of language yet when Cheney says it on the Senate Floor in public (and probably broadcast on C-Span which would qualify him for the new fines they enacted..I should look for it on C-Span and then submit a complaint to the FCC and have him fined...that would be a bite).   Again I have no problem with foul language but if you are going to expect one side to live up to a certain standard then they should do just the same. If you criticize one side then do the same for the other side.  What I have noticed is that republicans have become the party of "do what we say but not as we do". Just like almost all right wing religious nut preachers and christians.  I don't have much hope for our nation for the next four or five years frankly. If we re-elect king moron then we will surely be dragged into more conflicts, loose almost all funding for domestic programs (education, healthcare, EPA) and see military spending increase greatly. Taxes will continue to drop on the ultra wealthy and corporations while the tax burden is shifted to the middle and low class.   If we elect the corpse we will still be in trouble because he proposes tax cuts for companies (although some rollbacks on the taxes on the rich). He will probably drag us into more war and other nasty things. Whatever happens it will be doubtful that he would be re-elected because so many drastic things will have to happen while he is president that no one would vote again for him.  2008 and we see some glimmer of hope if our nation is still intact. We may see Dean run again..and if he does he should tell people exactly the truth. If they had nominated him in 04' he would have had things fixed up by now or at least on the road to recovery.  I just hope that regardless over the next few years that our fellow humans have patience with us until the people can take back our country.  Just give us time people...we will get things back on the right track sooner or later.  Peace

      Tomorrow is Ed's wedding and I am going to escape on the down low for a few hours to attend it. I am looking forward to it...at the very least I will be able to have a couple of beers and say cheers to the couple.  On the health front there is not to much to report outside of my PFT's are going the wrong way. When you come in and do all the treatment and have all the IV antibiotics you can possibly stand the whole idea to the torture is that your lung functions may improve. Not me...no sir. Instead I come in, get tortured (and like it mostly), and loose lung function percentages. I went from an FEV1 or 39% a month and a half ago to 28% roughly two weeks ago, and then just yesterday my FEV1 was down to 23%. Overall capacity dropped from high 50%'s to the low 40%'s yesterday. I hate that this is happening but there isn't much I can do about it but hold on for the ride and hope for a new pair of lungs.  I saw an interview of Bush by an Irish reporter for his trip over there today. He is pretty much hated all over Europe equally. He was saying that the majority of Europeans were in agreement with his war in Iraq. I don't know where he got that idea but almost all of Europe was against it with the exception of the governments of England, Italy, and Spain. However even those nations who's governments support the war the people of those nations are overwhelmingly against the war. She was a good reporter because when Bush would tell a lie (which was pretty much as soon as he opened his mouth) she would try and tell him otherwise. When he said that most of Europe was with him she tried to point out that the majority of Europeans were against the war he would interrupt her and tell her she was wrong. It was absolutely baffling because he almost looked like he believed what he was saying. I mean I know he has admitted with pride (he was proud of this?!?) that he doesn't read. I never could understand what he doesn't read. Was it the newspaper, or books, or reports from the intelligentsia apparatus? What exactly does he not read? I have a feeling that he doesn't read anything except maybe his speeches. How do I know he reads his speeches, because he often mispronounces words and in most of the cases of him screwing up words I doubt he actually knows what they mean.  I have no respect for this President. He is not worthy of any respect and if I were a soldier I would not salute him or any of his administration. In all likelihood I would be attempting to find a legal way for the military to remove him from office and allow elections sooner. I would also be looking for a way to root out the Neo-Cons because their ideas and visions are truly dangerous for not only the people of the US but also the rest of the people on this planet.  I cannot respect any group that elevates people who are uneducated, illiterate twits to their top ranks so they can manipulate that person. I cannot respect any group of people who say one thing, mean another, and enact something totally different. The people wear christianity as a badge yet have very little knowledge of how or what a christian is supposed to live. Hell many christians don't even know how they are supposed to live, but they all know they must live in fear.  The people on the right are in fear all the time. They are in fear about loosing their jobs, in fear of a god of vengeance that is taught every Sunday and Wednesday. These people are scared of people in the far flung corners of the planet not because there is a genuine threat but rather an irrational reaction because their leaders (the right wingers), and indeed the moderates leaders as well. The far radical right operates on and out of fear as well. The fear that they will be caught, they fear loss of power, they fear poverty, they fear people wising up. That is why the people on the right are often the most combative people around. They are constantly trying to defend against imaginary enemies while at the same time trying to bring more people into the ranks of the right.  The right is afraid. Afraid of what I don't know, but they are afraid. It is not just fear here in the good ole USA, if you look around the world and pinpoint all of the radical or fundamentalist right groups or religions, they are all afraid. Afraid of something that is not real. The way they have been able to gain power is by brokering in that fear. As long as we allow ourselves to be afraid then the right will always run things and keep us in fear and at war with each other while they sit back, watch the show, and make money off of our deaths and our fears.  Stop being afraid. There is nothing out there to be afraid of. Don't even be afraid of death, it is yet another stage of life. There is no need for fear anymore.  Peace

      Did I mention that I look like shit. I am having a breakout on my face...I hate being 27 and still having problems with zits and stuff. It is part and parcel of the meds that I am on for CF. I wish that it would all clear up for good because I hate having these breakouts.   Maybe I will get lucky and it will stop...but I doubt it.  I just want it to clear up. I am self conscious about my weight (I want to weigh more than I do), my back because is is curved and I wish that when I sat up straight it would be straight to, I wish that my teeth were white...they are yellow and spotty because of the meds I am on...and I wish my skin would clear up. I have had only a few points in my life where it was clear...and again it is the meds that cause all the problems.  Outside of those few things I am pretty confident of myself. I like the way I look and there is nothing I would drastically change, but the few things I wish were different would make me feel all that much better about myself if they were fixed.  Peace

      I am so happy. Danielle stopped by today and brought me a cinnamon and sugar bagel and a cup of chai tea.  She looks good but she feels like shit. Her blood tests were all out of whack and she stopped by today because she was on her way to an appointment to have her lungs looked at. I hope that it all goes well and that she starts to perk up more soon because what is the point of getting new parts if you can't go out, have fun, and enjoy them.  Something that has been floating around on this CF gimp board that I subscribe to (actually a mailing list) and it has to do with how people perceive CF patients based on looks. To look at most CF patients we look pretty normal on the outside, we may be thin in many cases, but mostly you can't tell. Now I have a gimp pass so that I can park closer. It has helped me many a time when I haven't felt all that good and allowed me to get out and be self sufficient when going to the store. I don't have to rely on someone else to help me from my car.  Here is the problem with it all. People look at me and often confront me about having the gimp tag and using it. It doesn't help that I drive a big white Oldsmobile Aurora (Oldsmobile's are usually old people cars...or had that reputation). People look at me and assume that I am relatively healthy just from looks but I am not.   I don't know how to put it and sometimes it is really frustrating to deal with people that don't know. When I am confronted about it there are times that I just want to go off and make them feel through my words how shitty things are. Sometimes I wish that I had this power that I could look at them and muster all the pain that I have gone through and the shortness of breath then touch that person and have them experience it if only for a few seconds. After they crumble to the ground crying I could then ask them if they now have any questions.  I hate being sick, I hate knowing myself so well, I hate wanting to be so involved yet sidelined because of my health.  Not to much sooner and I will be able to move forward...I can hardly wait because there is a lot out there left for me to do.  Peace

      I am sitting here watching "The Simple Life 2" and it is so damn funny. I mean those two are just boobs...well they have boobs but I mean they are boobs in the "fool" category.  I think I am going to enjoy watching it this season.  Don't have much else to talk about right at the moment. If something comes up I will write.  Peace

      Early this morning I was watching CNN and on the Early Morning show, not American Morning, but the show before it the man on there derided Michael Moore and his movie and called it propaganda and said it was filled with lies. His cohost looked at him as if he had just farted and called him on it. I wish I could remember the whole exchange but it was just absolutely uncalled for. I cannot believe that an anchorman would say something like that on air. That show in the morning is not an opinion show it is a news show where they report the news. It is fine if he has his opinion and its good that he does but that particular show and that particular time were not the appropriate time to be voicing it, especially in saying that the film lies. Did he see it? If he hasn't then he is relying on either uninformed speculation or has only read the talking points of Hannity or Rush.  From the previews that I have seen and the articles I have read this particular movie is not the typical Michael Moore movie like Roger & Me or Bowling for Columbine. Both movies contained fact but twisted and distorted pieces of video to make points that could not have been made without manipulating the situation. For this movie the articles by the people who have seen it basically say that even if it is much propaganda that it still raises good questions and asks things that haven't been asked by mainstream media at all.  Again I am mad about how the anchorman handled it this morning and I am going to try and get his name and then send it off to the films crack team that have been put together to counter all the little right wingnut attacks. So we will see. It was wrong and not appropriate and the guy should apologize to the viewers and state that while he believes his ideas but he should have reserved them for an opinion show or other forum, not the news.  Peace

      Things are finally getting all straightened out. My guts still hurt a bit but much less as time goes on.  I was able to get the meds increased. I now can get oxycodone every four hours, and the oxycontin was increased to 20mg every 12 hours. Also the Benadryl has been increased to 50mg every fours hours. That takes care of most of the med problems.  As for the hole in my stomach hopefully it will be healed up soon. I think they may scope me to see if it is healed, fortunately they knock you out for that...  Talked with the Third World Assasin aka The doctor who fucked up and he tried to explain and weasel his way out of responsibility. I told him that he screwed up and when he didn't listen to me when I said it wasn't placed correctly that at that point the prudent thing that should have been done was get a CT to see if the tube was placed correctly. Since he didn't do that he neglected the complaint and let it go. From there on it was a series of failures from that point on that were not the fault of the staff. All of the errors stemmed from his poor decision and his lack of interest in making sure everything was ok.  He continued to try and get out of it all and I finally just told him that it was unacceptable what he did and ultimately it was his responsibility. He then told me that he was going to check on me tomorrow (later today) and I said that I preffered not to see him and that I would rather see one of the other doctors from that practice. I then thanked him for taking the time to come down and dismissed him.  If he had come down and made a point of appologizing on Saturday and being the guy who did the follow up care and attempted to fix the problem I probably would let this all slide. Instead he avoided me until today (Tuesday...I'm still on Tuesday) and only came after he got a call from patient advocate department to get records and paperwork from him. He rushed down after that to try and cover his ass...but it is to late.  I am going to sue him...not for money so much. Of coarse I want something for the pain abd additional time down, not to mention because he nearly killed me. I do want for him to pay the difference of bills for me having to go down to the CCU (ICU) and pick up those extra costs and reimburse Medicare because it could have been avoided with a simple CT scan.  I am not asking for much, but I do want it to stick in his mind that in the future he should listen to his patients. I know my body and when I say something is wrong I am usually right.  Well things are coming along...I don't know how much longer at this point but I know it may be a bit more time.  Until later...  Peace

      So here is what happened. I came into the hospital because I dropped my FEV1 from 39% to 28% in about four weeks. It is time for a tune up and hopefully roll back a little of the damage, and if nothing else get the infection under control.  Back in March I had a PEG tube placed and I thought while I am here I might as well have the cap thingy put in instead of having that huge ass tube that I could lasso my dog with.  I should have known better when I saw the GI guy looking at the packaging and the directions on the Button package. It got me a little worried but I just thought this guy surely has done this and this may be just a tad different from ones he has done before. Well I still dont know if he had done others but from my experience I am pretty sure he had little experience.  First he told me this is gonna hurt a little bit but it will be okhe then grabs hold of the G tube and yanks the damn thing out. Of coarse it hurt like a mofo and I was crying by then but I still had a bit to go. We had to get the button in yet.  Still studying the packaging he decides to go ahead. He takes the button and pushes it into my stomach and then inflated the retaining balloon. Well immediately I could tell that something wasnt right at all. I told him that I didnt think it was in properly but he dismissed it and said it was fine. Well throughout the day on Friday I was having some pretty hellacious pain in my guts. I kept telling everyone but was pretty much ignored.  Meanwhile I am trying to not have to take shitloads of narcotics because the last thing I want stamped on my chart is med seeker that is the death bell for people in true pain. You have to walk a tightrope getting enough to take the edge off but not so much that the docs just think you like getting high.  Well Friday night rolls on and the pain was worse and worse. The kept giving me Dilauded and that was helping but in the end I didnt know how much I had. They started the tube feeding and within a few minutes I was screaming bloody murder. The came down and by that time I had unhooked myself from the feeding equipment. They soon came down to see what I was screaming about and I was still in pain and writhing around apparently. So the shot me up with more Dilauded. Now I was on schedule of 2mg every four hours which was keeping most of the pain at bay. However apparently I had way more than that over the course of just a few hours. All of the feeding fluid was going into my body cavity instead of my stomach.  Next thing I know I am coming around in ICU.  I found out later from one of my friends who is a nurse here on my floor that I had coded and they had to bring in the crash cart and all. The didnt need to shock me but my O2 sats were down to 23%...frankly I should have been dead. My friend the nurse came in that morning and noticed all the bustle around my room so she came to investigate. When she got in here I apparently waved at her and said something but for the life of me I dont remember.  All of this was a cascade of bad events that ended up in me coding.  The problem that I have is what if anything am I going to do about it. If the doctor had listened to me in the first place this chain of events would have never occurred. I dont know what I want to about it and I am looking for some advice. Pretty much I am forgiving dude and few things bother me with the exception of negligence, laziness, or just plain ignorance, as well as not knowing your job.  The even worse part is my doctor has pulled the dilauded out of my schedule. Which really sucks. I could understand if I was a heroin junky that scored a bad bag, but this was not my fault in the least. The OD was cause by a cascade of eventsand now I get to pay for them both in pain and in the battle it will be to get the meds back on the list of things I need.  Again I dont know what I should do because I was just getting to the point where I knew if I needed meds to control pain I could get them without sounding like a drug seeker. Now that is shot to hell because now I have a history of OD.  So what do you folks suggestI want to cut the GI guys heart out with a spoonwhy a spoon? Because it will hurt more.  Peace

      Where have I been that I haven't updated my blog in a day and a half. Well let me tell you. I have been in ICU...yup ICU, now let me explain how I got here as best as I can piece it together.  It started when Dr. Aziz came to replace my PEG tube (feeding tube) with a Button (much smaller device that is less intrusive and easier to live with). Well when Aziz yanked out the tube it hurt like a bitch and I was starting to think that something went wrong. I should have known when he was looking at the directions on the box on how to insert the damn thing that he probably wasn't qualified to do it. Well he jammed the new one in there and I knew it wasn't in my stomach and I said something, plus it was really hurting like a bitch. I told him it didn't feel right and he dismissed it and said it was fine.  Later that evening I was getting ready for bed and they came to hook me up for tube feeding. We probably got only a few CC's in but I don't really know for sure because I was pretty out of it all. I started screaming because it hurt really really bad. Now we get to the point where I have very little recollection of what happened.  The must have given me more Dilauded because of the pain...or at least one of the residents did. I remember puking all over the place, then the next thing I know I am coming to in the ICU with a re-breather oxygen mask on.  So basically I think I od'd without any direct action from me to make it happen. Go figure.  Yesterday I went and had to get a CT scan to see where the tube was and they had to put some contrast in it, the gave me something down there for pain and it worked somewhat well because I didn't scream out in pain as I had earlier when my nurse was just trying to push a little air into it to see if she could hear it in my stomach (I about jumped off the bed when she did that). They got the contrast in and it turns out I was right. It was just dangling in my gut and anything that was put through it went into my body cavity and not the stomach like it was supposed to.  Later another GI doc came up and removed it...it hurt but at least it was out.  Now everything is hurting worse than before and it hurst to breath even because of the gut pain. I think there is something in there that shouldn't be. The kicker is though that Dr. Weinburg doesn't want me to have anymore IV pain meds because I od'd. Even though I had no control over it, and it wasn't like I scored some bad heroin, they OD'd me and now I have to pay the price in pain for it.  He has me on Oxycodone and Oxycontin, the codone is for "breakout" pain, the contin is longer lasting. Problem is that neither is actually enough to numb the pain. I would need a lot more of it more frequently to get the same relief as a small dose of just about any IV pain med.  Again let me stess I am in pain because someone fucked up and they won't give me pain meds that work because someone else fucked up. I had been fighting for a long time to get any kind of pain med and then just like that, something that I did not do, I get the relief taken away.  They are going to do another CT scan to see if something else is damaged. I have this feeling that something else is broken down there. This kind of pain isn't just normal belly pain, this is "something is broke you dumb fuck" kinda pain. Even if they don't find anything it won't matter, they aren't going to get me on the right pain meds anyway.  I had been trying to keep myself from looking like a pain med seeker so I have been very judicious about asking for meds even though I am in a lot of pain, now it is going to be even worse because now I have an OD on my charts. Again someone else fucks up and I pay.  Fuckin a, fuckin a...

      Damnit...dropped that last post I wrote.  Well I won't repeat it because I am to lazy to type it out again.  The jist of it was that I am going to start getting together a lot of Health Care info and I am going to find out how much state health care bennefits have been cut and where they have been cut. In the past four days I have heard of three seperate states that are cutting their health care programs for chidlren and disabled adults. Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas are all cutting programs either completely or so deeply that they might as well cut the programs altogether. That is in addition to the Federal Government or rather the Bush Administration has removed all CHIPs funding in the 05 budget that is now being shoved through the congress.  I am going to compile all the changes in the coverage and then I am going to figure out the costs of a national program, put together proposals for enactment, and shop them out to politicians.    In the process I will also be looking at other nations and how they implement their national health care systems. I think with a close look at how other nations do it we can then build an awesome health care system that serves all who need it here in the states.  It means that I will have to learn a lot and then I will have to help explain it all to people.  It will be my job I imagine and then pimp it out to people. It is going to be interesting.  Peace  If you run across articles or online blurbs about public health care cuts in your area or state please send it on to me I would be very greatful for the help.   michael.honse@gmail.com  Send it all there.

      I have been pondering over the last day of what I am going to do and how am I going to do it.  I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do with my time. I have a lot of research to do over the next month or so. I need to compile a database of health care for the world. I want to know how much each nation spends on health care per capita and then I need to compare systems.  It is a lot to do and I know that it will take me some time to get it all together but once I get it together I will be able to approach the topic of healthcare for our nation from a more educated standpoint.  I would appreciate any articles that people run across about health care cuts to state programs. Please email them to me at michael.honse@gmail.com that would help me out. I would love to see online articles, newspaper bits, anything that talks about cutting bennefits to the needy. I need to know all of this so that I can see how much damage is being done by all the cuts.  I am not out of the hospital just yet. I am still fighting all of this crap in my lungs and a fight it is.   Maybe I can get myself healthy and then make getting health care for us all my job. I have been needing to find my nitch and I know that it has always been there for me. I am going to be the best I can at that and I will also become a pundant. I will spare no mercy on those who do not agree. I will be the best. I will be the voice of all of us. I watch those people on TV and they talk about shit that really doesn't matter to the majority of the population. I think there is a better way to do it all. I will find it and I will make the system come to me somehow...I don't know why or how but I know that something is going to happen. Maybe it will be my calling.  Peace

      I didn't get out yet. My PFT's are no higher or lower than when I came in so I get to stay a bit longer.  Yesterday I was interviewed by a sociologist from a little college in Carlisle PA called Dickinson. It was my honor to talk to Dan and Maggie for their project. I am not sure what all they were looking for. I know they were wanting to know how people live with CF, not medically but outside of that. What our lives are like, how does it involve our personal relationships with other people, romantic relationships, etc...  I enjoyed talking with them because as I have said before my life is pretty much an open book for those who want to read it. That is part of why I have this blog. I try to keep it as open as I possibly can so that when people read it they can see that I am a person that has much conflict of policy and idealism. There are many things that I believe in such as the death penalty. It appeals to my primal gotta-get-even center of my brain. I often find myself thinking about certain people or criminals that they are great candidates for the death penalty. However I know that the death penalty does not deter crime, it accomplishes nothing in the grand scheme of things so why bother. It also is a sign of how barbaric a society is. If you are still wanting or craving this basic act of revenge it only helps to show that maybe you aren't up to speed with social ideals.  These are the conflicts I face. I love guns and I think that any person who is not a violent person should be aloud to own whatever they want. A howitzer, fine just don't blow anyone or anyone's property up. I think you should be able to own an arsenal but I do believe in some forms of gun control. I believe that it can be helpful but I also know that most criminals don't get their guns from legal dealers. They may go through a straw purchase (having a friend or relative get the weapon for someone who can't), they can purchase it from a private owner, or just steal a gun. So gun control ultimately only really tracks those who purchase weapons legally. Again though I don't think that it is a bad idea to have some sort of controls on weapons.  That is what this blog is for, that is what my life is like. I love politics, I love conflict, I love learning and then teaching.   I beg of the people that read my blog to give input because how am I to know what others think. That is why I have the comments section. Please send me input and let me know how I am doing.  I am going to go ahead and announce here that this blog may suffer a slowdown of posts possibly over the next quarter or more time. Basically there have been a lot of bad things happening in health care and cuts to state budgets that are threatening to start taking away health care that is needed for many people including myself. What it comes down to is that I have to do something and become active somehow.   The past couple of days I have read several news articles announcing cuts to heath and welfare programs in combination with me pirating (which I don't do often because I don't have a problem with ripping off big media, but I feel bad for taking money away from directors and actors) and downloading "Fahrenheit 9/11" by Michael Moore. I knew all of the things he stated in the movie, the sheer theft of tax payers money, the welfare for corporations that is always forthcoming, yet for example CHiPs (Child Health Insurance Program is what I think it stands for and covers children with no health care for both poor and many middle class kids that have severe illnesses or lack of basic care) is being completely cut out of the Bush Administrations budget proposal for 05'. That money would not be provided to the states which in turn find their CHIPS programs. The states will have to do one of two things. They could gut or eliminate the CHIPs program for their state or the state could cut funding from other health related programs to try and make up the shortfall from lack of Federal Dollars. It also places the state into the uncomfortable position to have to increase taxes or run large deficits. In the states where you have Republican control it is even worse. In those states they first cut programs relentlessly, they then cut taxes where they can, third they run deficit spending as high as possible. The reason is because they want to bankrupt the governments so they can privatized as much of the services as possible.  It is a very dangerous thing they are doing. They essentially want to take as much money from the taxpayers as possible and transfer that money into private companies for services because they believe that private companies can do things more efficiently than the government can. They use the argument that government wastes a lot of money of projects for example the 400 dollar hammer or other outrageous prices for things we can pick up at Wal-Mart or your local hardware store for a few bucks. However they never tell you that it was a private contractor that charged them 400 bucks for a hammer, or where other gross overcharging occurs. Every instance can be traced back to a private contractor overcharging the government so what do you think will happen when private companies take over even more of the duties of the government.   They want to stop social spending altogether so that money can flow into other areas where companies can justify taking more than they could than if the money is supposed to be going to the needy or ill.  I have come to a place where I have to stand up and fight for what I know is right. I can not stand on the sidelines and watch these people destroy my nation, take away programs that many good people depend on. I can not allow that to happen.   Over the next few months I will be gathering data and reports and try to put together a movement if you please to try and fight this. That is why posts here may drop from time to time. I am limited in what I can do because of my health, I am limited in my resources, but I do have a computer, access to the internet from anywhere, and a mind so I am going to fight. I will keep people updated on what is going on.  Mind you what I plant to do. What I hope to do is put together a platform of sound health care plans and options that will be farmed to all politicians. Whomever decides that they like our position then we will support that politician or candidate. If they are in office and claim to be in support of our platform and do nothing to promote it then we will confront them. I want to be the pitt bull of medical care reform for a single payer public health care system. I want to be a pain in the politicians ass.  So hopefully we can get this going. My only cry to people is that they have the same view as me on health care and I will not care what their political leanings they have as long as they will help me fight for real substantive change.  Peace

      I did a bad thing and downloaded "Fahrenheit 9/11" by Michael Moore. The copy that I downloaded was unfortunately not a complete or finished copy.   It was the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie stirred such deep emotions that all I could do was cry while I watched it. To watch a movie about things I have been reading about, to see the pieces put together in front of my eyes, to see it visualized and put together. This movie isn't the worst I have ever seen...the content is the worst subject to cover because it is true.  My mother has told me over and over again that the way I talk is anti-American and she feels that I hate America. I love my country, I love the idea of my nation, I love many of my fellow countrymen and women, but I detest my government and all of the leaders within in. I detest the fact that many of my fellow Americans cannot look past the end of their nose and see that the real war, the real battle is not between us and some little shit nation on the other side of the world, it is not with some man in a cave, our war is with other human beings. We bomb these people back past the stone age most of the time. It is a war that is not even valid or remotely real in the sense of that these people are a threat to me or any of my fellow countrymen and women. The real war, the real battle is between the vast majority of people on the bottom end of the economic scale and those very few who hold power and riches.   We are in a war and we the people are loosing. There is no difference between my family and an average Iraqi, Indian, Iranian, Israeli, French, British, or Mexican family. We all struggle for the same thing, our families strive for the same thing, we strive to have food on the table, happiness in our homes, and the hope that our families will be healthy. We are all the same in that respect, we all strive for basically the same thing. We all have a common enemy and it is the upper crust of our societies, the powerful in our societies. Not all rich people are bad, not all powerful people are rich, and not all powerful people are bad, but the vast majority are. People with money and or power will do anything to keep and gather more of it and the prime way to do it is to lead us against each other. Powerful people only remain powerful when they are allowed to pit us against each other and in the process it makes wealthy men who have absolutely no compassion for anything or anyone outside of themselves.  I don't know how I can explain it any better but to say that all people are the same. If you want to go and avenge the beheading of Nick Berg or any of those poor people who have been brutally killed...if you feel that we should go and kill those barbarians and behead them then you are no better than those people, you are no better than the people that want to drive the masses against each other. You are a barbarian just like the rich and powerful.  Crime of all sorts and kinds comes out of a need for control, power, and wealth or some combination of the three. A rapist is someone who wants control and to dominate someone else, a crook is someone who wants control and to gain wealth. All crime is based in those three basic things. All crime comes out of it corporate, personal, or national. Our nation is nothing but an international criminal in its search and war to gain control, power, and wealth. It is that simple. If we spent as much time and energy as well as resources that we do on trying to gain those things we could solve almost any problem from world hunger to split ends on your hair. There is no problem that cannot be solved that if we put our minds to it in an equal and equitable fashion then we could really start to heal ourselves and our planet.  The movie was not a typical Moore film at all. He only pulled his schtick in small portions of the film. Fortunately Moore allowed facts to tell the story and only a couple of times did I find where people might find things confusing because of how he sequenced things. Otherwise he put together a horribly wonderful film. I am saddened that a film like this has the facts to support it. It is sad that the story is indeed true. I hope that more people see the film and it sparks them to go do there own research. We should never take one persons word on faith as the absolute truth because that is how we enable powerful people the ability to turn us against ourselves.   The even sadder thing is that Bush may be defeated in November but in reality little will change. Kerry won't stop the war or calling for wars. He will be in power and it will corrupt him. We would be better off with Kerry but not by much. The simple fact is that our government no longer serves the interest of the people it only serves the interests of the rich and powerful. I think it is getting close to revolution time, for the people to rise and speak as one around the globe that we are no longer going to kill each other for the powerful and wealthy people's amusement or benefit. If Bush has a grudge against Hussein let them fight it out man to man.   That movie has made me mad and made me want to change things...I cannot stand by and let these things happen. To see the brutality of our weapons ripping apart children and women, people burned by napalm, for what? For what? Because someone needs more money or power. This war does not benefit me or the average soldier. No more personal freedom will be seen by the average Iraqi person all they continue to see is oppression and fear that they had under Saddam...and to say that at least we aren't killing them by the thousands and we aren't torturing them then I beg to differ. We drop bombs on them daily and whether we like it or not those bombs kill more innocent people than "terrorists", and we have seen the pictures of torture. We haven't seen all of those pics so I can't and most of you can't say "at least we didn't cut of limbs or fingers" because we don't and probably won't know all the facts and details of the torture that is worse than we saw in those pictures.  All of mankind is created equal in that we all have the capacity to be Hitlers, Hussein, Stalin, Napoleon, Bush, Reagan, or any other number of equally despicable dictators, rulers, or criminals. It is every one of us. We also have the ability to be Mother Teresa, Gandhi, or other humanitarians. The goal should be for all of us to try and foster the growth of good people.  First we must wake up to the cold plain truth of it all. Second we need to acknowledge those problems. Third we need inspire and lift up good deeds to the level of attention and adulation that we give sports stars and business people. Fourth we need to forgive those people that have kept us at war for their benefit and profit. Fifth we must make sure that we do not allow ourselves be ruled by fear and the same forces that control us now. We must resist that urge to follow blindly and resist following on sheer faith alone. Doing it that way has allowed humans to continue to be bad people.  Go see the movie and I am pretty sure you many of you will cry as I did.  Peace

      This is a continuation of the incident I had during my first couple of days in the hospital. I had all those problems on the 19th where Dr. Aziz had removed my PEG tube so that he could put in a button instead. His missed getting the button into the stomach so when I had a feeding that night the fluid went directly into my abdominal cavity cause great pain. My belly was distended and was limiting my ability to breath and then because of the pain my nurse was able to get my normal 2mg of dilauded upped to 4mg to catch the pain. Well they didnt know what all was wrong and didnt realize my belly was distended and once the dilauded was on board it naturally slowed my breathing down.  Long story short I coded and we traced it back to the button not being properly placed that led to the chain of events that caused the code.  Today I had my PEG tube replaced and went in for the procedure and all went well there, they kept me a little longer in recovery just to keep an eye on me with all the meds they had in me for twilight sedation and pain meds. Just to make sure. Once I was pretty much aware (which they hit me with a reversal very quickly after the procedure was finished) they brought me up to my room and immediately I needed some pain medication because the stuff they gave me down there was wearing off.  Well I already have prescribed meds 5mg oxycodone every four hours as needed and 20mg oxycontin every 12 hours. The added meds that were approved was another 5mg of oxycodone every four hours. I knew it was low but I wasnt going to fuss until I knew for sure that 10mg wouldnt work. Took the 10mg oxycodone and no dice, the final bits of the bigger meds wore off from downstairs and the oxycodone wasnt cutting it. I requested that we see if we can get something stronger just to take the edge off, not to rid me completely of the pain just get the edge off.  My nurse called my docs service and the doc on call said I could have 15mg of oxycodone once and then back to 10mg every four hours. She brought it in and I took it because at that point I was crying even though I knew it wouldnt work. I explained to my nurse what had happened at the beginning of my stay and said that it wasnt supposed to be a problem in getting IV pain meds when needed for bad pain. The doc had seen that I had the OD which wasnt an OD but rather a bunch of crap that just dominoed out of control.  So my mom called the service and then talked to the doc on call and he was telling her he cant give me more because of my OD a bit back and oxycodone was all he was going to give meshe crawled all up his ass and he ended up calling my regular doc. He called in 1mg of dilauded every three hours as needed and I am now finding out if that is all the pain meds I get or if I still have the oxycodone every four hours plus oxycontin twice a day.  The problem was that I should have been able to get IV meds but was unable to because of my chart and record (mind you my first PEG tube I was ordered 1mg dilauded every four hours and vicoden 7/500 every two as needed). I had talked with my doc because I was afraid that this exact thing would happen and it did.  Before I wasnt to worried about what all happened and would have accepted an apology from Dr. Aziz for his fuck up, he never did and instead tried to weasel his way out of it saying things like He couldnt tell or it happens every 1 in 100 and other crap, I replied well when it doesnt feel right or you arent confident that it is placed correctly what do you do? He said we get a CT scan. Well he didnt that day because I was the last task of the day for him so he blew out at the end of his shift even with me saying it wasnt right.  After that exchange I wanted for him to pay the difference to the insurance company as well as Medicare for the additional costs of his screw up like ICU costs, extra CT scans and suchnothing for me but reimbursement for the extra costs.  Now that I have had this problem with getting meds because of his fuckup and me in pain and having to track down my doc to get something that would work and knowing that this will happen again in the future now I want blood.  What would you folks do? I have already had my family look for a malpractice lawyer and as luck would have it we know one and his daughter studied voice under my grandmother. I feel bad in one way because I dont want to bring a frivolous lawsuit and the system needs reformed so huge settlements for silly ass things would never flyI am torn on what to do.  What would you do? What would you ask for? It wasnt about money for me in the beginning, but now having dealt with what I feared no more than a week later and knowing that if it happened this time it wont change anytime soon and if my doc is out of town then other docs who arent in the loop to what happened then I will be in pain until I get a hold of my normal doc. What would you ask for? What would you demand? Am I overreacting to this all? Please let me know what you would do  ________________________________________________________________________  That was a letter I wrote to my CF group and it pretty much sums up my suck ass day.  Peace

      WEll today I am going to be getting another PEG tube put in...oh joy!  It is better that I have one because this whole eating thing is just not working. I will also try weight gain formulas instead of that crap they give you. First the aftertaste in the morning is just bleech...and secondly if I am going to be filling my stomach and not eating during the day I might as well put something in there that has more calories than what that crap they give you.  The good thing about surgery is you go in, they give you the drugs, then you wake up later on with everything done. Another good thing is that they will be giving me better pain meds, or rather stronger ones. Maybe I can get the Dilaudid back because that shit works miracles. Oxycodone products (Vicodan, oxycodone, Oxycontin, and others) work when you get enough in me...but they don't work well at the doses they give me which are too low considering my high tolerance to pain meds.  Well that is all for this update...I will probably update while I am still drugged when I get back so the post may be interesting...  Peace

      We turned Iraq back over to the Iraqis yesterday and it looks like there is going to be much more bloodshed over the next year or so.  CNN has a story about what people on the streets over there thought about it all. The wanted us to go...blaa blaa blaa. They are leary of the new "governors" and government that is in place. Then they got to a newspaper publisher and he is running a headline today which was pretty interesting and I hadn't thought of it all this way. The headline goes something like this "America keeps its promise" and goes on to tell what happened.  I am glad that we did hand soverienty back over to them, but what we handed them is a bit of legal mumbo jumbo that really sais that if they (Iraqi government) want to change parts of the laws Bremer and his crack team of corporate leaders and lawyers they have to come up with big votes and the way the structure is set up it may be impossible in practice to do.  The prime minister Ayad Allawi was a loyal Ba'athist leader until he left the nation a while back. He has little experience and I believe he comes out of the same school of thought as Hussein. Allawi is a brutish thug that thinks he has great ideas, not unlike Hussein. If some people are correct in their assesments we may have just installed the next Hussein.  I hope that things calm down for a couple of simple reasons. 1st I want for our troops to get home as quickly and safely as possible. I just wish we were leaving now and let the nation drag itself into a civil war and then deal with the regime that comes out of it. 2nd I want it to end soon because the Iraqi people have been brutalized for the past 35 years and we have only continued the pratice. I fear that we may not know how to deal with them and their culture differences, but it is clear that we are bumbling about making things harder. 3rd That whatever Iraqi state that emerges will be a secular state and reject fundamentalist religions.  That is my wish list. I don't want Bush to get the credit at all. I want for there to be a debate of what we did and how badly we damaged our relationships with other nations around the world.  I will say something positive about what has happened and what is going on. We were wrong to do what we did but we have done a few good things. They now have a less limited TV channel and mor papers have cropped up spurring free speech. We have been attempting to get schools open and hospital equipet (why that one is so hard is beyond me...they could do it and fully stock drugs for hospital in mere months if the money is invested). There are things that are getting better, but it is going to continue to be hard and we will continue bleeding. I just hope we can get a pressure dressing on it soon or we may loose it all and be dead in the water.  Personal stuff. I am still in the hospital. My PFT (lung function test) was bad a few days ago (worse than what they admitted me for), the second one I had on Sunday was back to where I was when I was brought in. Overall no real improvement. So Dr. Weinburg wants to keep me a bit longer.  My pre-albunim levels (protien measurement) was 18.9 when I came in. 20 is normal so I was not to terribly low. The last set of blood they got yesterday moring shows that my levels have dropped to 8-9 which is not good. The best reason for this happening is the whole ICU adventure. First I am a skinny little dude, I have few resources to go digging into when things go bad. Well after the ICU visit I was on a clear liquid diet then was bumped to dark liquid diet (grits and other stuff like that). I finally got back on a regular menu and my appetite is pretty much shot. I will put something in my mouth and chew and chew and chew and then try to swallow. The top portion of the swallowing mechanism (back of mouth) works somewhat ok. It is the middle bits that are causing problem. I have to fight to get basically mush into my stomach. It is something physical because I am having trouble with getting even pills down (considering I could take 10-15 at a time) has me worried. I need for those parts to work.  The nutritionist (which she is nice here and helps out as much as she can) stopped by and told me about my albunin levels and said to me that she thinks I need the tube badly to get my minerals in order. I know it doesn't help me gain weight. Doctor Weinburg also agreed and first we are going to look and see if a fungus is causing problems with swallowing and if that is the case then we will treat that and then swallowing may come back on its own. However they are also going to evaluate me to have another PEG tube in. I think that I won't escape not having to get one. They suck bacause they just hang all balls out. I am going to ask if I can go directly to the button. My stomach hole is almost healed totally and they may be able to cut back through and save the one hole and just get it into my stomach. We will see...I would use it more often (every day and night) if it was easier and less intrusive to me, and less balls out hanging of hoses and such.  With the lungs not perking up he is going to run a coarse of Solumdrol (a steriod) to get them working maybe a bit better. It should also stimulate hunger. I am glad I didn't leave today because no more than an hour after Weinburg leaving I had a treatment and went for CPT (chest physical therapy -aka- a beating). I didn't just but barely get comfortable and then after two lite taps I knew something popped. I didn't even bother to cough as it just slid out of my mouth. I had the moron PFT dude here and once it started I asked him to get me a contianer to cough in or anything that will hold sloopy  bloody gew. It took him almost five mintuse to find the bucket I asked for and just grabbed the whole thin and brought it over. Now in this bucket is assorted goodies you might need incliding a spit cup. So she's handing me the entire bucket with all the shit and I just reached in grabed the kindey like bowl to cough into it. I then just gave him a dirty look. I don't like him because he is just a poor respiratory therapist and probably the worst here in this hospital.  After Weinburg got back he lookes at it and mumbled "guess I am glad I didn't let him go". This will give him a chance to figure out what is up. so...  Well it is very early in the morn and I want to get some sleep.  Peace out

      Nevermind about Wednesday...we already transferred sovereignty of Iraq back to them. It changes nothing, we still will be occupying, we still be making most of the choices, we will still be the "security" for them, and if they ask us to leave we will laugh at them and tell them to get back to pretending that they are running things.  We know that the right-wing nutters will all be out on the talk shows and news shows talking about how smooth it went and how they now have control. Bush will once again be the "hero". It will look like we caught Hussein in the polls. Bush will receive a bump in the poles but once people realize that there will be continued violence against Iraqis, our troops will still be in the crossfire and many more will die (unfortunately), the beheading will continue. Nothing will change and we will still pretty much be in control...the difference is they have a home grown "hero" that has done a great job in the past working for the CIA.  Oh something that I don't know if I had mentioned before is the situation with the detainees from Afghanistan, and prisoners from Iraq. The Red Cross and several other groups have come out and said that first they should have more access to these folks, but more importantly they need to charge them with a crime, release them, or break international law.  The administration line is that Afghan detainees do not fall under the Geneva Convention because the Taliban never signed onto the treaty, and that Al-Qaida forces are not under them either because they are "enemy combatants" that have practically no rights for anything. Legally they may have a case in some weird way but they painted themselves into a corner on these folks legally. First when a case was brought by a lawyer who could not gain access to his client there as well as take sworn testimony from others. The military and justice department claimed that because they could not be questioned because of their status and that the supreme court has no jurisdiction over them because they are not in the country. Then they claimed that Gitmo was part of sovereign US territory so certain laws applied. Basically the Administration tried to play both sides...so it is confusing.  As for Iraqi prisoners the administration considers the top guys from the Hussein regime as prisoners of war. Well the good ole' Geneva Convention says that once the war is over and all prisoners captured during the war, the winning party or the ones who have custody of the prisoners have to bring charges on these people if they did anything within 90 days or they have to set them loose, or they can break the rules of the treaty which is what they have done.  Hussein has fallen into a limbo situation. He has been in custody for over 90 days, the war is over, and he hasn't been charged or released so keeping him in custody is against international treaties and law. It is claimed that we will not turn him over the  Iraqi courts until we can guarantee that he will get a fair trial (hah! yeah right!) so we still have him. The US government will not turn him over to the international court because during the trial they will be able to indict other big wigs who helped him get weapons or facilitated war crimes (gassing of Kurds and Iranians). So who would that be...hmm Donald Rumsfeld could be charged with crimes against humanity, the late Reagan could have been charged, and many many others high in the government that was in place during the 80's (Papa Bush would also be charged). So world court is a no no...so we have to turn him over the new government there or we have to deal with him.  Oh things are just so fucked up...and if we could actually get Hussein a fair trial it could take down the all mighty neo-cons.  Oh and on another note. Hussein, Bin-Laden, Scott Peterson, Kobe Bryant...in our court system, in our law, they are all innocent until proven guilty by a court of law. Sure we know Hussein was a bad dude and killed many of his own people...and yes he is guilty as hell, but he still deserves a fair trial. The same with Bin-Laden...we pretty much know he did it and planned it but under our system he is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. I hate all those people who attack people like me or Michael Moore when we state this point of fact. It doesn't mean that I think they didn't do it, but to serve justice, to be a true democracy, and to follow the law that has been practiced for many many years we must insure they get a fair trial. It is the American way...if you are out there saying why bother with a trial for these dudes just hang em high...well I hope that you are never caught up in some false charges over killing a little retarded girl. The evidence may point to you but in reality someone else did it, but if you go with the "screw it he's guilty" ideology then the system might go away and you won't get a trial. So as repugnant as it seems these men are still due there basic rights.  Peace

      I may be going home a little later today if I am lucky but I am thinking that there is something brewing, while not fully out the bugs are certainly partying up in my lungs.  After I coded last Friday evening I went on O2 and have been on it since. Without the O2 my sats drop to between 82-89% on room air. I require some O2 to get back into the norm. Right now I am on 2 litres of O2 and my sats hover around 90-94%, on more oxygen the better they get. The room air sat was at rest to, and that scares me. I me going on O2 no.  Right now I am watching "Enemy at the Gates"...an excellent movie.  Well I am going to try and sleep.  Peace

      Wednesday is the day that we turn "power" back over to the Iraqi puppet regime. The violence is getting worse by the day, more Iraqis are dying each day, US troops are in the crossfire, the resistors are getting bolder, and all the while the administation line is that things are better.  Inflation supposedly hasn't risen but for those of us who aren't wealthy inflation is a bitch. Inflation is based off of a rise in price of durable goods (car, dishwashers, I don't know about housing but I think it is counted as well) in addition to other goods and services like food, gas, and a whole host of other things.  Milk in some places is over 4 gallon, gas is hovering right around the 2 dollar mark (although we still pay less than most of the world for gas), foodstuffs have gone up because it costs more to get food to market, housing costs are up, energy costs are up...all of these things are up yet inflation is still low. The problem is that wages haven't risen to keep pace with these basic goods. Sure a washing machine cost the same as last year, but you can't eat a washing machine.  Inflation has happened only to the poor...or rather it is the poor that are suffering the most. The pay check that has remained the same for the past year or more isn't making it now when the basics command a higher price.  It is all just a mess. So what the economy gained 100,000 jobs in a month. Chances are that job is lower paying for many of the workers getting jobs now then their last job paid. So not only is Joe making less in dollar amount per pay cycle, but that money is also worth less than just a year ago.  The nation is groaning under its debt. Trillions in federal debt, tens of trillions in private debt and Bush says things are getting better. Well Mr Bush it may be getting better for you and your circle of men, but for the rest of us it isn't...  Things are going to break soon. I just hope it breaks for better and we come out with something better because we certainly cannot keep doing it the way we are doing.  Peace

      I got an email today from the person who runs the CysticL mailing list. He wants me to stay on topic and stop saying other shit. I sent out a reply to a reply of a reply...basically I floated a porn movie idea...it wasn't dirty or descriptive, it was funny. He also wants me to tone down the political discussions that I often have/do/start.   I kinda told him that I would tone down the off topic stuff (basically not spin things out as far as I do...my brain will spin things to the n-th degree and I often write it down or say it out loud...my little censor dude gave up a long time ago and said fuck it...let him make an ass out of himself) but I told him that he could pretty much shove it up his ass for other things. I will hold political discussions about health care and what our government does because it does directly effect CF patients.   Also my kidneys feel a bit better...so I am not as gimpy as I was.  Off to read some news and other stuff.  Peace

      Today I have been pretty miserable. I hope that the rest of this day goes better.  I am rehydrating myself because I think that I am very dehydrated. That is probably why my parts hurt (kidneys), and might be interfering with me just being able to breath well.  Well I am going to get some rest after I get my next shot of dilauded.  Goodnight.

      One of the nurses here at the hospital brought me a couple of old issues of Time. Many of the things, and people involved, are the same cast of characters now.  The issue is from December 13, 1971. In the reader comment section of Time some people posed or nominated a couple of characters that are now on the front lines.  "Sir: My nomination for Man of the Year: John Kerry. His eloquent, haunting protest against the war may well mark a turning point in our country's 'long day's journey into the night.'"  By: Jero Magon of Miami Beach  "Sir: For Man of the Year: the uncaped crusader, Ralph Nader."  By: Mrs. M.E. Valentine of Dearing, Kans.  It is interesting to note that the players that were around then are still around 33 years later. I find that sad because it means that politics and the whole machine is definitely not geared to bring in new ideas and leadership.  Health Matters.  I went down for a CT earlier today to find out what in the hell is going on that has been drawing down my O2 sats. I had to get another IV because they can't put the contrast right into the PICC line because of where it dumps out at. The contrast, had it gone through the PICC line and dumped out where the PICC line ends, could have caused a serious embolism.   The CT scan showed that there aren't any huge mucus plugs or blood clots, but it does show some sort of diffusion in there that could be a new virus that we haven't seen in me yet.   My kidneys started hurting earlier today, not just uncomfortable hurt, rather please stab me in the heart with a rusty spoon, salt, and lemon drops for sterilization.   The biggest problem is that my O2 sats are dropping more each day and that is the scary part.  So maybe if we can figure out what that stuff is on the scan and treat it, suck it out, or yell at it, then I think things will get better.  Peace

      Ok I am going to bitch a little. I am having a lot of problems breathing and my sats keep on dropping.  With 8 litres of oxygen I am at 91%, at night worse I guess because in the morning the past few mornings my oxygen has been bumped up another litre or two.  Right now I can barely breath it feels like so I am going to relax some more and just remain calm.  Peace from the purple boy.

      Instead of sneakily changing my previous post I need to report that the news about the Bush documents didn't hit the light of day until 6:47 AM. I reported that it hit the world at around 6:30. That was the last time that I had looked at the clock before I laid back and relaxed (I also got benadryl and dilauded at that time so time moves funky on those drugs).  So there is the correction. I don't want people to say "YOU LIED!!!"...I just got the times mixed up by about 17 minutes.  Peace

      If I had felt a little better when I first heard this early this morning around 6:30 AM I would have posted it immediately. What would posses me to want to post something that early considering I had been asleep (I was woken up for Benadryl, Dilauded, and Fortaz) and would have slipped back into the warm embrace of unconsciousness.  There was a very short bit of blurb or press release from the White House. It seems that three months of El-Presidente' Bushs' military record had been destroyed. The real shocking part is that it was the months of service records that would show where he had been when missing and why; possibly, he was decertified for flight. I am sure that is was this big ole' mistake and all of the records from that three month period for his Texas Air National Guard unit were destroyed...so if you wanted to oh say, find someone else's record it would be impossible. The New York Times is the one who is reporting this mess. It seems that there was an effort to preserve microfitch films of payroll records and they were destroyed.  I don't know how you screw that kind of restoration and preservation up. They have been practicing for many years in keeping them fresh and usable. It is just mighty damn convenient.  I just wanted to get that up. I heard it first on CNN and they were reporting on a NY Times report.  Some linx...how clever of me linx/links (wink wink)   NY Times links may require registration   Reuters report at NY Times.     The same article different place on NY Times.     Campaign 2004 Coverage on NY Times.    You may have to register to get the articles...but registration is free.  Regardless of whether it was truly an accident or it was a deliberate destruction of files there is something else that comes into play. When the records were finally pried from the White House some time back at the beginning of the year they claimed that those were all the files and they had done thorough research trying to find the paperwork. They released all of it with some of it blacked out for privacy reasons (which I understand, but it looks like he is hiding something he is still entitled to some privacy) they made a very big deal of the fact that they were releasing all of the files and that they missed nothing. Remember they released them late on a Friday evening and didn't let the press remove them from the office so they had to scour through them late in the evening and were not allowed to take them out to thoroughly vet them. So they lied again on this...while it may have taken them by surprise, it really should not have if they had truly looked under every rock, looked through all the records and such. So it was a lie of omission.  Peace

      There is so much coming to head today. We have terrorist alerts at such a strange time. Even given the benefit of the doubt and they may be planning a large attack, the timing is just way to damn convenient.  Stories of Pakistani security forces being given deadlines to catch or kill the top leaders like Bin-Laden and others.   However the congress, specifically the Senate is locked up with legislation about a gay marriage constitutional ban, and other worthless pieces of legislation instead of bringing up the bill that funds our intelligence machine and money that is needed to make preparations for a possible terrorist attack.  Of coarse the Republicans say that the Democrats are holding things up because they refuse to vote on the other bills, the Dems blame the Republicans because of bumping up the legislation for funding they would rather have things go in sequence and before that bill comes other much less important bills that will probably not be passed anyway.  I have an idea...dump all non-essential bills. Get to security bills, get to bills that send money to police and firefighters. Who cares about a fruit marrying a fruit. If you are more concerned about gay marriage and think that it should take precedence over anti-terrorism legislation and funding...then go for it. You know what you deserve to die.   Fucking retards.

      I have been looking over the past few days of posts and I have noticed something. Actually I noticed it earlier this morning when I was being given my morning doses of IV meds. Let me explain.  Over the past few days I have been breathing a little faster and shallower. I haven't thought to much about it until this morning when the pieces just fell into place.  This morning I had ripped my oxygen off at some point during the night and when my early morning IV treatment which this morning included benadryl, dilaudid, fortaz, and then added this morning was a blood draw. When the nurse first woke me up I guess I was kinda going along with it all then all of a sudden I was aware but blank and I asked what I was supposed to be doing when she handed me the blood collection stuff. She looked at me strangely and then she said she was going to get the other meds. It came to me but it took a good minute for me to realize what I was supposed to do. Once it clicked in my head I drew out the waste blood and then got the blood sample they needed and just sat there pretty much dead headed. It was a strange and uncomfortable feeling. I put the oxygen back on and pretty soon I started to get back in the game and started processing things more completely.   When I am not on oxygen I go goofy. My lungs have finally gotten to the point where I think I may need to have oxygen all the time. I was completely disoriented and it only got better once my O2 levels came up. When I mentioned what happened to my nurse that is taking care of me now he said that the night shift nurse had said something about me being disoriented when I didn't have the O2 on. So it was like a revelation out of the blue.  Damn that sucks because I really don't want to have to drag around an O2 tank and shit. I was hoping that I could stave off carrying around an O2 tank altogether and just get to transplant or whatever was going to happen. I guess I will learn to deal with it as I have to with other things but I really didn't want to have to. Side effects of low oxygen is that my fingers peel. The skin up to the nail starts peeling back and that has really kicked in the past few days.  Shit.  I also wanted to do an early post because of some things I have seen over the past few hours. Particularly concerning the Kerry - Edwards campaign already. I saw their first speech together and it was almost like night and day. Kerry is a shitty speech giver. He is able to say a lot without making a point. He can tap dance around an issue, give a twenty minute speech, and all you asked is "how was your day". When Edwards got up it was lightning had hit the crowd. While the applauded and cheered Kerry, the might as well have built an altar and sacrificed some virgins for Edwards because he was just that much better. He picked up where he left off during the primaries and just kicked ass.  Now I will give Kerry a little bit of a bone. He has started to get better at giving rousing speeches and I believe that one on one with Bush he will definitely look smarter, sound smarter, but I fear that he may do to much tap dancing. I fear that his intelligence may work against him. I understand what he says, many people do, but we all just want to yell at him "GET TO THE FRIGGIN' POINT". There is nothing wrong with the way I feel or many others. Our hopes are on the line here. Many of us feel that the very future of humanity may be on the line. I feel personally that if we choose Bush we choose war. We will be at war for some period of time and it will cost us the good will of the world and in the end we will be defeated. If we choose Kerry I cannot say for sure that there will not be war, but I do have the feeling that Kerry won't go marching off on premature or pre-emptive wars. Will Kerry stop the bloodshed in Iraq or will he remove us from that mess. I doubt it. I would hope that he would listen to the will of smarter people and just get us the hell out of there, but I doubt he will. We do need to find a way to help them, maybe we leave and just send food and equipment, let them fight out a new government. I dunno the answer because it has now become infinitely worse.  Back to the campaign. Edwards is a help. He is able to identify with normal people. I don't care that he is worth something in the neighborhood of 30 million, and that Kerry through his wife Teresa is worth between 500 million to a billion bucks. I don't care about that. What I care about is what they are going to do to help me, or rather are they going to make my life harder or easier. Harder is me worrying that I may loose my health insurance, easier is me not having to worry about that. I don't expect gold to rain down and the economy to miraculously open up and honey to flow freely. We just need for it not to have bad fiscal policy that is driving our nation into ever deeper depths increasing the likelihood of our nation foundering and put into a position where it will be ripe for the armies of "privatizers" to come in and destroy what so many people have given their lives for over our history.  This campaign is a turning point, I am not so naive to think that if we elect Kerry - Edwards all will be magically better, rather if we vote them in then we at least will have a few more years on this our experiment.   So forget about Kerry being dull (he talks all the right things that are emotional...but rarely does emotion seep through the tough veneer), forget that he blusters on for interminable periods of time, but in the end he is the better choice and the best hope that we can keep on rockin' in the free world.  Peace  One last thing. This is an article that I stumbled across that says what I have tried to say about Michael Moore's  "Fahrenheit 9/11" . Give it a read as it really is dead on.

      Woo...I thought that they had monkeyed around with Blogger some more. I am glad they didn't because I am used to this format.  I cleaned the room pretty nicely because there was just odds and ends hanging around. So I got it cleaned up and the room looks nice...a side note is that I got a bit hungry and I have been biting the heads off of sour patch kids (you see when you bite their heads off you need to make little screaming noises so that people with think you are eating babies....mmm babies. I want my baby back baby back baby back ribs...chilis baby back ribs....git in my belly!  Ok enough of that. I have this bumper sticker that I can fill in. It has a "I" then a heart, and then you fill in the rest with whatever you want. I was going to go with WHORES! But lets face it...I don't want a whore (unless she is a dirty dirty girl like Christina).  I got two compliments today. One was from a family friend. I had wrote her a letter about what all happened since I had gotten into the hospital. I really don't remember much of the letter because I scribbled it down so soon. Apparently what I wrote was a very detailed description and she liked it. This lady is a retired librarian so she knows good from bad. She showed the letter to her daughter (or daughter in law) who teaches an English class and she raved over it. My friend called to tell me that she loved the letter and to ask me if I would allow for her daughter (in law?) to use it in her English class to drive home the descriptions. Hey so something I have done is going to live on and be taught with.  Also I had a newcomer to my blog site last night. She is a nurse from the hospital here. Normally I do not invite people from the hospital because I am weird and if it got out how weird my care might get whacky...naa but there are some things that are part of my sordid past. Some things of coarse I would change, but overall I am proud of the work I have done. This nurse complimented me on the content and told me to continue to be true to me. Woah!  I have things to work out...and right now I am dead ass tired. I am about to get a booster or benadryl and then dilauded.  I will be back tomorrow....till then  Peace

      I am currently doing a complete backup of my Toshiba Pocket PC GenioE 550. It is about time just so I have it all if for example it does something goofy and I have to restore the system.  My friend Kate stopped by last night (7/5 and early 7/6) and we chatted for a bit. She is pretty damn cool and easy to talk with because she has shit to say.  Today a friend of the family just popped into town. Carol Lee is a great person and I love her dearly. She is the lady that has offered to give me a place to say, a car, and all sorts of things to just make me happy and help her out. She certainly is a great person and would bend over backwards if there was anything she could ever do for me. I feel really lucky because in reality I have a great set of people around me in my family and they are very supportive.  She gave me a great compliment today and it is actually something that I have been thinking about it so getting the compliment made me feel like I wasn't just wasting time. She said that she thinks that I should go back to school and get a political science degree with a history minor (anyone who has read this blog would understand that I would easily pass these courses without much effort). Then with that teach and write books. She knows my teaching style and I will toot my horn a little...I can do a good job at teaching and you will walk out with the heavier duty words because I will use simple language and attach the more difficult terms to it all and associate it so that people get what it means. I am like Edwards and what they are saying where he can break down complex directives and speech and break it down to what people can understand. I do that well.  I do want to write and I am practicing and trying to work out some of my bad habits. I will then have to pick a topic and run with it. Like I have said I have ideas in the works for things I want to do and from that I can teach and become active. I want to be on the national show and challenge these dufuses about ideas they supposedly know all about what middle America wants.  Well I am going to get myself ready for another shot of benadryl and dilauded then I need to get some food from the cafeteria and then hit the sack.  Thank you all for sticking with my blog and know that you will see the changes as they happen. Hopefully you will all become somewhat active with me....and if you all give input into my work you will all be credited.   Peace...  Oh yeah and I have a few more blogs to add and some other stuff. I am also going to be working to make this place a place where I will feel no shame about letting the nursing and hospital staff read....so I will have to not forget and slip and say I would chase her in the weeds kinda thing.  Night all.

      I am going to drop a quick note that this mailing list that I am on for CF patients is just a lot of fun.  Many people on there are prudes and seem to get their knickers in a knot over really silly stuff. However most of the people are really nice and can take a joke well, and it does have some great things going for it because they are all there only for support and questions from each other. It is a good place to get things out, but it also a good place to have fun.  TTYL  Peace

      Well obviously those posts I wrote did go through but I wasn't able to tell that they had actually made it to the blog.  I am watching "Fahrenheit 9/11" again just so I can stay enraged on this; our Nations Birthday, travesty of what is going on in the world.  Our Nation is now 228 years old. We are still a young nation in looking at others around the world. Our democratic republic has been the most ambitious attempt at creating a society that allows great personal freedoms to go after any goal one could ever imagine. The great part is that even with all of our national faults people have proven time and time again that any man or woman can lift themselves from one socio-economic class to another. The promise of this nation is that it offers the opportunity to go as far as you want. Our nation is great and nearly alone in this idea or practice. The promise that our nation can be a beacon to the rest of the world of personal freedom and political progressiveness. The sad part of all this is that our nation is faultering in these ideals.   Our nation is in grave danger from a very determined group of individuals that preach the virtues of our system yet continuously subvert them through money, political clout, and downright theft in many cases.   Some of us know who I am talking about some of you don't. I will give you a clue as to whom these people are although I cannot tell you outright to continue my thought or spread the word because that actually subverts the very idea of our own nation. The enemies of our nation are the very people who wear their patriotism and religion on their sleeves. They are the people who tell you to listen and follow blindly without questioning what we are doing or where we are going, much less what it will cost in lives, dollars, and above all else our own personal freedoms. You have seen these people on TV lieing about current world events, although many people don't see the lies or recognize them, but if you don't believe them then we can look at these same people who say "You are with us, or you are with them, the terrorists." Those are the people who are the true threat to our nation. It crosses party lines, there is no specific race behind it all. This is a large group of people from all sorts of walks of life.  I also speak of Pastors, Ministors, Rabbis, Emans, and all religious leaders that have that same mentality. You are with them or you are with the damned. All of these people are the same. One group may be running our nation, the others running our moral lives. All of them are the same, they are all terrorists of the worst kind. They are the terrorists of thought, the terrorists that take away our freedoms, the terrorists are those people that seek to keep us in fear all the time regardless of what is going on around us.  9/11 changed things for us for sure. The biggest thing that it changed was our blindness to the rest of the world. We lost 3000+ lives, we launched two wars that have had tens of thousands of civilian dead, we have lost around 900 of our finest in military actions. However probably the most devistating loss to us has been the loss of the illusion. Finally with the blinders off we now see what the rest of the world has lived with for many years. Our nation has been lucky on the terrorism front, we have remained relatively untouched considering the role we have played in causing terror around the world.   The loss of the blinders, the opening of our eyes to even a cleansed, sanitized, and largely censored view of the rest of the world has cost us our national sanity.  Sanity? Yes. Sanity. Since we were not attacked but rather the target of a terrorist strike or event whatever you want to call it we have lost our minds. We had people on TV selling parachutes for people in skyscrapers to use in case of fire or terrorist attack to use as a means of escape. There has been a marked increase in sales of so called "safe rooms"...hell we were told that we could survive a biologic or chemical weapon attack if we simply sealed off a room in our house with duct tape and plastic. I wonder just how many people actually fell for that. I wonder how many people honestly felt that with some plastic sheets and duct tap they could avoid anthrax, or worse. How many people really fell for that. The simple fact is if you sealed yourself into a room with plastic and duct tape when an attack was happening it probably wouldn't stop the little baddies getting through that minimal barrier, but if you did manage to seal yourself up well enough you would run out of air to breath.   We lost our sanity and we have willingly given into fear. When we started to fear we gave up willingly many rights that our men and women of the military have fought for. What our forefathers struggled for, and what we continue to preach that we have. It is ashame that at the very time we are supposedly bringing "democracy and freedom" to other nations, offering up our military for that ideal in other nations, at the same time many of the very rights we fight for are being taken away here at home. They aren't fighting to take them away, we are handing them our rights.  It is time to stop the madness. It is time to stand up and say that we are more affraid of loosing our rights than being the victim of a terrorist attack. It is time that we actually honor those who died in the name of our freedom on that trajic day in 2001. We must honor them by taking back what we have lost.   So on this 4th of July 2004 I mourn for my nation. I mourn for the men and women who have died for my nation, a nation that has been hijacked by fundamentalists no better than those who occupy caves in Afghanistan, or the deserts of Iraq, or those who are here, now plotting their next strike. I mourn that we have become largely a nation of scared people who no longer rely on themselves for their truth but rely on those who have lied to them over and over again.  On this day I also see that our nation is on the verge of rebirth. I see all of the various groups and interests coming around, heading directly for each other in a crash that will shake the world. Out of this crash I feel that our nation will be better for it. I feel that on the other side we will be that beacon to others. At no other time in our history have we seen such forces at work, while many have said that before I truly feel that we are in a time of change.   So on this, the 228th birthday of our nation, I see that she is coming to a rebirth.   Long live the United States of America and her promise to be the best that humans can be.   Let us focus our attention and energies of shaking the tree of freedom and loosening the bonds of fear.   I don't know about all of you, but I am ready to have my nation back.  Celebrate that our nation is indeed a great experiment and we are currently adding many ingredients and pretty soon we will have something new.  Peace...love your fellow man. Love those around you who dispise you. If you live that way and pratice this every day and you will be better than all those out there who would drive us around in fear.

      Lets try this post again.  I am going to compile a database of each state's Public Health Care plans and systems. In that database I am going to look at the number of people it serves from year to year, the amount of money spent year to year, and the budget year to year. Basically what I am going to do is see how much the systems have been cut.  I will need some help in getting the numbers together but mainly I will need to have people help me collect and compile news articles on state health care budget cuts.  The whole idea is to find out how fast the system is shrinking and then find out through calculations how much it would cost to insure the uninsured. Ultimately I want to see how much it would cost to have a national single payer health care system.  Now here is one of the things that I think should stay the same. I think that hospital groups like UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center), or other University hospitals, and all hospitals (except VA facilities and those need to be upgraded and fully funded immediately) will remain under their current control structures. In other words the Government doesn't appropriate them, instead they will bill one entity for all medical bills. You can, and should, keep records of procedures and costs per patient but the hospital won't nesecarily won't bill individually. The hospital will submit a monthly bill to the insurance system and it pays it out to the hospital. Auditing will be done every so many years.  Adding new technology to a hospital will be a cyclical thing. A new type of scanner is on the market that is usefull then the hospitals buy them just like they always do and then pass the bills on to the insurer as part of what would be a yearly upgrade budget for hospitals. There will be of coarse funds that will allow for hospitals to expand and renovate when needed but again because the hospitals are run privately or as they are now the billing only goes to one place. They still have to come up with money for new wings or equipment. There will be some money available each year from the Government but the rest will come from fund raisng drives or through submitting grants. Also they could by the equipment and expense it over a period of time.  The idea is to allow hospitals to run as they do now but instead of having to bill up to 250 different plans just bill one place. Overhead goes down radically and the waste of beaurocracy is almost gone immediately.  Well that is all tonight....maybe this one will post afterall.  Peace

      Hmmm..they have changed the input section yet again. It is pleasing to the eye and it looks like they have added a few things. &nbsp; Anyways Steven Hawkings has solved his own paradox or so he says. He will be presenting it soon. Basically from what I understand he said that everything that goes into a black hole get gobbled up and just goes "poof" and all the information of the matter that went in there is lost. It is complex quantum physics stuff that I certainly have little grasp on. I just know something isn't right about the whole "poof" its gone. He now thinks that black holes essentially leak information over time so it destroys his "poof" idea. Here is a  Newscientist.com writeup on it.  &nbsp; I think that theoretically any black hole can gobble up all of the matter in this universe over an infinite period of time. When it finishes gobbling up the universe or matter here that matter isn't just lost it goes "bang" into a new universe and we have the big bang all over again. Now the limiter is time because it becomes meaningless. So there can be billions of black holes in this universe and they are all creating new universes elsewhere on another plane. Because time is the limiting factor or rather not a factor you essentially have this continual big bang happening over and over again as a new black hole forms. So once one forms a new universe is started because time doesn't matter. That is what I think. That is the only way I can wrap my mind around it because I always thought you cannot destroy matter, you can move it, you can change it from one form to another, but you cannot outright destroy or create it so it has to come from or go somewhere.  &nbsp; Wow my head hurts after that one.&nbsp;I love the theoretical stuff. I wish that I was smarter so that I could do that.  &nbsp; Well if Hawkings comes out and says this in his speech then guess what I got it down first. I have thought this over and over again.  &nbsp; Anyways...I am going to surf a bit more then probably sleep. &nbsp; Peace

      They finally got me back to a normal room and I can't tell you how much better it is. The rooms are about the same size but they are better configured and plus I have a mini-fridge here in the room so I can get to keep extra food and drinks with me.  I had another little lung bleed again this morning. It happens, I am not going to get to upset with it all. As long as it stops like it did then it isn't a big deal.   I don't know what else to say this morning except that I am mad because they have on Golfing on TNT instead of my normal morning TV schedule. 10AM ER, 11AM ER, 12PM Judging Amy, 1PM Law and Order. It is all just screwed up so I have to float and I am actually watching ESPN and on right now is the trade of Shaq to the Miami Heat. It is actually the most interesting thing on right now. Plus I like Shaq. I like how he lives, I like that he says that he is no role model so put him up as one, yet he lives a pretty decent and private life. I just see a good man who wants to get paid for his play and he plays well. I just hope that he can continue to be a good role model because even though he says he doesn't to be, it seems almost out of question that he would get caught up in any kind of a scandal. He has kept his lifestyle on the downlow and if he has diddled outside of his marriage is seems that he does it right. I doubt that he does that completely though after seeing him in various shows with his wife and those kids he has. You can just tell that he is love with them and would never do something to jeapordize that and I have a great deal of respect for that.  I also like the fact that he credits his parents for where he is and that his drill seargent dad kept him inline. I believe that is why he is the way he is. If he were to screw up it would disapoint his parents and I think that he holds them in high regard.  Well I am going to surf around for a bit. Dr. Weinberg said that he thinks that these ports in here are supposed to be setup for Ethernet. If they are then I will need to get wireless router so that I can get all my stuff working. I love my internet on the phone but if I can get uber speed through the ethernet port then I am all for it. That will make things easier for me down the road. As I get sicker (which is going to happen I have realized that) I know that I will be spending more time here. So I might as well have all the right stuff on hand so that I can play and have some fun. There are things that I want to do.  I am looking to build a better SFF box (small form factor). The new stuff that is getting ready to come out is driving costs down. I just want to get a system that has everything built in and allows for the possibility of RAID drive in the future because I would love to get two WD Raptor 10,000RPM 74GB SATA drives and RAID them together and have my third drive be just a big ole SATA drive (I have 120GB right now and I love that drive). Also I have a decent processor and good RAM and an excellent vid card. I can also get a full fledged double layer DVD+-R/RW burner for about 90 bucks. If I can put this new system together for a few hundred bucks that means I can pass down a system to my mom then my grandmother and I would get her old box so I could set up a storage server and get to my Terabyte of storage that I want to get too. I think I can do it.   Well of to read this review of a new SFF and see if it fits. I will go to a better one after a year or two (I think I want to go to a Dual Opteron SFF that is coming out, but only if it has PCI Express for the new cards, enough room for a RAID drive, I can live with the extra storage out on the network...so I have a lot of plans).  Off to read...  Will update later.  Peace

      I have been reading around a bit and I was right many people have started writing about the whole idea of postponing or canceling the election on Nov.2 and how bad an idea it is.  Unfortunately my brief rant pales in comparison. My was a little more anger filled and fact light, but I did get the way it would happen right. President Bush is the only one who can declare a State of Emergency, once he does that FEMA becomes the default government which basically cancels out all of the rest of it.  FEMA runs the nation and ultimately at the head of FEMA is the president. They literally take over everything including your own car and property. Everything falls under them and then they declare martial law to basically enforce it all. This swing essentially is for six months if the President chooses so and the congress can not take up the State of Emergency issue for at least 6 months.  Now in this article that I am going to give the link to gives all the solid code and law behind it showing that it is indeed a real problem that I would expect Bush and crew would seriously consider doing to remain in power. The reason that he could and would is because he has seriously made 9/11 into a political weapon.   Basically if there is a threat, a real one (and I happen to believe that there is the good possibility that something may happen) and the Administration didn't do anything they would be knocked for it. Also if the Democrats raise to much of a stink and essentially make it politically impossible for him to do it and an attack did happen the Democratic Party would literally crumble because they will be portrayed as having let it happen which the Republicans would say "we could have stopped this if the president had the power" kind of argument. However if it is allowed to happen because we are in fear then the terrorists have won and we might as well stop being us. Plus all of the worst things that have been happening under this administration will come on full bore and you just know that is dangerous for all of us.  Well I will not longer bore you with my paltry words. I know turn you over to  William Rivers Pitt and "Only Cowards Cancel Elections".   Very well written and how if puts it is poetic.

      This was a letter that I sent to my CysticL support group and I thought I would post it on my blog for tonight.  --------------------------------------------------------That is an absolutely astute observation that doesn't just apply to our little group but that should apply to our day to day routine.  I think that there has been a large attack on intellectualism in this country and around the world...but especially here in the United States and I have been able to see it in just my short life.   What does this nation hold up as that standard bearers of "wealth" or good living. They hold up sports hero's, models, actors, and all sorts of people that aren't always the brightest bulbs on the trees.  We see every night on our evening local new the scores for all the local football, basketball, baseball (not even always girls mostly just guys) scores and who did better. You have MVP's and others. You may see once a year the spelling bee national conference, and then maybe one or two local stories of those kids who do exceptionally well in their class.   It continues on to college in a big way. How many dollars does the university give to have English or History full scholarships. Now look over at the sport department and you will see that many if not all students there have some sort of scholarship and many of those scholarships are full tuition scholarships.   Now many people say that sports programs bring in lucrative contracts to the universities that infuse millions into them. The problem is the money almost always goes without fail to the sports programs for stadiums and many other things. All of the endorsement deals put shoes on their feet, uniforms on their backs, and helmets on their heads. The TV deals go to support scholarships and great TV studios (that rarely if you have AV tracks at your university get to use those facilities and often find themselves using older equipment). So all of the money that the University derives from the sports program goes right back into it and then the University still has a budget for them that grows each year, meanwhile they cut science funding, or they decided to put off a computer lab upgrade for a year.   During all of this the students tuitions are going up. Now how does this fall into the placating and dumbing down of kids. Well used to we would get our education at schools and university level but now you can't expect to get it unless you fight for it.  We hold these people up as hero's, we hold up the all mighty dollar as the absolute measurement of success and happiness. Unfortunately that puts most of the world at a disadvantage. There is simply not enough for us all to be multi millionaires.   In doing that...or rather in figuring that out both political parties have joined together or rather an entire class, the rich, have loosely banded together to keep the rest of us placated and hungry enough to work hard for the possibility to move up, but only let a few people through so you keep the illusion that everyone will do well.  I watch it all the time. When you look at trying to engage in debate with a person outside of your socioeconomic class you are automatically called a class warrior, and your argument may have nothing to go with class outside of that there is a definite class system right or wrong.   You want to debate what is good for our nation, you not a patriot if you don't tow the President (dictators) line. Without question, yet our forefathers were great fans of debate. They would make it a sport almost. A speech that would be given back in that day would be several hours long and it would engage the audience at hand. People would fire questions at the candidates and then the candidates would actually answer the questions directly. An interesting thing.  Politics is verbal war. Many people have forgotten that politics is the practice of democracy, and politicians and the powerful people behind the scenes don't like for ordinary stiffs to be involved.  So well. I tell people be irreverent towards power. The powerful only derive power if you give it to them. I don't say be reckless. I don't say become an anarchist, but I do say become educated on something you like or an aspect of life you love because you can be an activist for anything. For CF'ers the best place to be an activist may actually be in health care and politics. We know what is going on and we have to deal with the system so might as well become good at it.  Whatever you do enjoy it...and it also means that you have to learn how to debate. Learn to play devils advocate on issues you might deplore. The reason is because you will be able to argue a better case against your foes.  I did that for a while on abortion rights. I am pro-choice in my legal standing and pro-life in my personal standing. It is not a weak position. I can comfortably tell people that I think it is horrible and they are destroying some sort of life, but I would not presume to attach my morals or ethics to anyone much less force them on someone. The law should be to allow safe reasonable abortions that follow good sound medical (not right wing partial birth and ugly term that doesnt even apply terms) terms and procedures. So let people choose. Do whatever you have to in helping clear your own conscience if it bothers you. Go down to health services and just engage, not nastily (remember you always catch more flies with honey) and talk to some of them. You may save a few, but chances are none. Remember that if you are the religious type then you should know that those people will have to answer for their own decisions, not you.  If you are pro-life, take the pro-choice side a couple of times and be open to it. Really research it and see that some of these people fighting for that right are fighting for some basic women's rights of having choice over there own bodies. It is hard but anyone with reasonable intelligence can do it. That is how I became pro-choice...and I also became that way while I was in my really religious phase because I kept on reading that god gives choices to all his creatures and we can choose to go his way or another way, but either way he loves ya.  Anyways...I tell people to question things and be ready to argue. It helps out. Drag your families into these discussions. I was always taught to listen twice as much as you talk (makes you look smart in front of strangers, but also you have two ear and one mouth so you should listen twice as much as you talk) but when at home keep on engaging people. If they won't, just keep on and keep on.  Well that is all I am going to get some sleep...  Peace -------------------------------------------------------------  Hope ya'll like it.  Tonight I started on the BYPAP machine. It is this device that kinda breaths for you...no tube and not invasive. It is a big ass mask that just has positive pressure on it and blows in when you inhale and draws air out when you exhale. I had it on last night and it brought me back quick like...so tonightI am giving it s shot again to see if tomorrow is even better.  Gnight'

      Well here is my "oh shit oh shit" update for the day.  Last night I coded...again.  I am not to sure of the events as usual but I remember flushing my IV because it was done and getting a head rush, I think I pushed for help, and I think I remember calling out for help...I think.  Last night Lori was looking after me and I know she was right in there helping me out...I'm sorry Lori I didn't mean to do that...I dunno what happened. Maybe I can get clued in.  I woke up kinda down here in the unit...again. They were taking a blood gas and I remember telling the guy it would be easier to get it out of my left side. They tried to get it a couple more times...anyway I have six holes that would be blood gas sticks.  It is all very odd. We will get to the bottoms of it sooner or later.  Peace  And no I am not dead yet...

      There was something else that I wanted to comment on but I just forgot about it.  Bush has turned down the NAACP for the fourth year to come and speak at their national convention.  He stated the reason he has turned down the invitation is because of "what those people have said about me"...umm so he is not going to give a speech because some of the NAACP top officials have been critical about the administrations handling of affirmative action legislation.  It is just a stupid thing. Bush is nothing but a racist pig. Every time they have to change Air Force one out and get one of the older birds to fly because of mechanical problems (seems to be a lot of "mechanical problems" throughout this administration) on the main Boeing 747 that jets him around the report is always "the president was not in any kind of danger"...all I do is snap my fingers, nod, and say well damn. It would be fitting if he went to Iraq on one of his secret fly ins and for the bird to be downed by RPG fire...I would cheer all day long. Bush is a piece of shit and we will be better off without him.  The more it goes on and the more often I have to see him, Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, Ridge, or any of that bunch of Nazis make me more and more angry and hoping and wishing that something will happen to knock all of them off at once...cut the entire head off of the republican party (don't forget Tom "show me the money" DeLay...he needs to be picked off as well).  Pieces of shit!  Peace

      I feel a bit better today and at least I didn't wake up completely short of breath, I hope it lasts through the day.  There has been more coverage of the possibility of election postponement. I hope I run across some op-ed pieces on it. As I do I will link them for you all.  Peace

      I have more links about this whole delaying the vote thing.    Commondreams.org Coverage     Truthout.org Coverage     MSNBC.com Coverage    Now these links are all based off of the same Newsweek Story and Reuters coverage. In each of the articles you will find links to those various sources as well.  It is all very scary. As I got the info up, many others were getting their info up. Most people simply got the story and reprinted it, so far I have yet to run across any opinions outside of my own. I had a link to the story but I also shared my thoughts about it all and my fears.  I am sure that over the next couple of days we will see more opinion pieces about it, but so far I am one of the first people to get an opinion up.  Health matters:  Today has been a shitty shitty day. All day I have been cycling between not so bad periods where I could breath easily to stretches where I couldn't catch my breath at all. There was not rhym or reason to it all and that tends to be very frustrating. It is also painful as well. The pain that you experience is very different from other pain. I really don't know how to explain it. Maybe if you were to take a deep breath and then swim from one side of a large pool to the other underwater without coming up for a breath and then turning around and getting half way back. When you come up and you at first are huffing for air, well take that first two huffs and puffs and extend that out for ten or twenty minutes. You have all the same muscle pain because you entire body can't get the carbon dioxide out so it is sitting in there giving you horrible pain. Well it is something like that. Oh yeah don't forget the headache that comes with it. It sears through you and it hurts horribly.  When it gets that bad there isn't much I can do but keep breathing. It hurts horribly but you do it. I have found that if I get a shot of pain meds and benadryl it calms me down real fast and I stop hyperventilating. That is probably the worst part of it is the hyperventilating.  I just hope we can figure out why it is happening so maybe we can keep it from happening more.  Well I am tired and I do need some sleep.  Peace

      Hi kids...and welcome to the new Fascist States of America, where a constitution and bill of rights watched over our land to keep us safe from the tyranny of evil men. These beacons of civilization held on high as if they were the documents of some radical religion, guarded zealously with the blood of millions of people from our own nation and protected from the blood of the tens of millions who dare challenge this most basic document set.  I despair that today may have been the warning shot, an alert, to the new norms in our once proud nation.  Today it has been found out that the Bush Administration has started to look at if a terrorist event were to happen before the November Election (or maybe even if it happens after the election up to the installment of the President on Jan. 20, 2005) whether or not it would be legal to declare a state of emergency and post pone the election for a set period of time or whether they could suspend the election for an unknown period of time.   There is precedence of this happening and it was relatively recent too. In World War 2 President Roosevelt was retained as President because he was already up to speed on the issues and the war and to replace him would be difficult at best, so they kept him for a third term until he died and Truman took over. The idea is that Roosevelt could have remained president as long as the war was on simply because of the logistical problems of getting a new guy up to speed.  That is the precedent. Today we have already had our "leader" say that this war will be a long one and a very dangerous struggle and that shifting courses mid-stream could be devastating for the nation so we should vote him in (that is his thinking at least).   You could say that well why wasn't it done in the Vietnam era, and there is a simple answer to that, the Vietnamese posed zero threat to the USA, they could not pull of any type of attack he on the homefront. If the Soviets had invaded then surely elections would have been postponed.  Some people will argue, and it is a valid argument (if your an idiot), that Bush would be doing it for the best of the nation and a vote would be held swiftly. The action would be a terrorist strike here, perhaps NYC or Washington, maybe LA, Bush would declare a state of emergency and martial law. All of the government would switch into a protective or secure mode which means the government becomes airtight and we cannot elect in new officials, actually it could give Bush even greater power to appoint more of his people to positions of national importance. Since the action happened during the "War on Terror" it would enforce the idea that our nation is in a state of war and give him the imperative to keep us from voting. Under a state of emergency and martial law all civil rights are removed and you have to listen to the government or you can be jailed or killed.  What about the courts. Well that beloved Supreme Court of ours is already leaning right and we have several judges that are on the verge of retirement. If the state of emergency was still in effect at that point Bush could and would install whomever he wanted to the vacated seat/s thereby tipping the court over to radical right. Also if the people were to bring suit to try and get voting reinstated the courts are nearly powerless to do anything. So if you managed to get a case heard it wouldn't likely go far.  This is scary. I talked about this over a year ago as it was something that I was frightened he would do. Scary scary scary stuff.  So welcome to the new Fascists States of America.  Ummm :-/  Linky Links    CNN's Coverage    Remember they are asking the Justice department, the very same group of crack lawyers who said torture is legal! and the Geneva convention was "Quaint". Somebody help us.

      Today has been another crap day but I have gotten a few more things in order. My grandmosther wants me to get antourh place. Partly because I am after all 27 and I should be out of the house by now. So I guess I will have to start thinking about that.  As for the Averatec I think that I am laying the groundwork for one and possibly another. One ultra-portable (my current system), another micro system with MS XP Tablet Edition (a kick ass spec'ed convertable Tablet PC...having one of those would just be fun). The third is the desktop replacement system. It has 3.0Ghz P4 HT Enabled, ATi 9600 64MB RAM, 512MB RAM, 60-80GB of HD Space, DVD+-R/RW/CD-R/RW combo drive. It seems that Averatec has decided to enter each of the mainstream markets, ultra-portable with the 3200 Series that I have (AMD XP-M 2000+, 256MB RAM, 40GB HD, S3 Omnichrome Graphics, DVD/CD-R/RW, 802.11G, and much more for a grand), the afformentioned 6100 Series for Desktop Replacement, and now the 3500 Series for TabletPC's based on a AMD XP-M 2200+, 512MB RAM, 80GB HD, DVD/CD-R/RW drive, 802.11G, and other goodies...  They seem to want to offer products for any occassion.  Well I am tired and tired and tired...so g'night.  Peace

      I must update...I must update...I must update. Hey I am reminding myself to update...and soon!!!  So here it goes.  I found out what the specs&nbsp;are in&nbsp;the New Averatec C3500 TabletPC Model.  AMD Athlon XP-M 2200+ (1.7Ghz) 512MB RAM up to 1GB 60-80 GB HD DVD/CD-R/RW drive Full keyboard (covertable style) 12.1 Inch Screen 4 USB 2.0 Ports 802.11G Microsoft Windows Tablet PC Edition Up to 4 and 1/2 hours on a charge.  Very decent specs...and it will start at $1350...so a kick ass deal! With the one I have and if it is any indication that these little units are good (and so far this one is kick ass) then I think Averatec just helped make TabletPC a viable alternative for students finally. If a product would have been available when I first headed off to class for that price I would have jumped all over it.  I am going to jump on this one as soon as I can because it is just kick ass. Averatec is also looking into doing a Centrino Laptop with high end graphics (NVidia 5700U Mobile or ATi 9700 Mobile both with 128MB RAM, a mid range Dothan Processor, all crammed into a small laptop like I have...or in a more traditional 15.4" setup. They need to do a compact with HDTV setings 16*9.&nbsp; That way there will be no wasted pixels for playing movies on these little machines.)  I will say something about the performance of this little beast. It runs warm...you can tell. It isn't super hot but could burn you if you are not careful. The battery life that I see is generally a little better than what is usually reviewed. I get around 3.5 hours of medium use with a Cell Phone attached drawing power for internet service. The keyboard is fairly responsive although a little cramped. I like the click feel for them indeed. It has an annoying clunk that comes from the HD from time to time...it is the thermocoupling fluid that is re-adjusting...or whatever it is called.  Well I passed out for a about half an hour and it is getting close to the next set of drugs...so I am going to zoink out some more.  Love to all...and hopefully&nbsp;a handy addition to my Laptop stable...and then after tablet from Averatec...possibly a gamer from Averated Desktop P4 @ 3.0 HT Enabled, 512MB RAM, 15.4" screen, 60-80GB HD, DVD-+R/RW/CD+RW, ATi 9600 64MB RAM, and some other bits...unless they get the Dothan System out....at and at that price point with higher graphics Ati 9700 128MB or Nvidia 5700U 128MB....if I knew for sure they were going to do that then I would go save for that and get it when it hits because it will be a hot portable, gaming ready. and just overall goodness.  Peace  Let me drop this old RAVER saying on ya'll.  P.L.U.R. (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect)...if we all showed it and praticed it daily the world would be a better place...a lot more polite at the very least.  Blaaaaa

      Today I had the most horrific experience that I think a person can have...well maybe not the worst but it damn well ranks up there.  &nbsp;  I went down to the GI lab today to have my PEG tube placed a little further down in the GI tract...well out of the stomach and into my intestines. Now to do this they have to scope you and look down there to guide things. Now to do this generally they put you into Twilight sleep which is not fully out but not awake, and certainly not aware.  &nbsp;  Well I already had a bad experience with the one asshole, now I have another bad experience. This is the doc (dick) that came to look at my tube over the weekend. It has been leaking since I got the damn thing...or rather stomach contents have been leaking out from the incision where all the mess goes into the belly.  &nbsp;  Well we decided to put the tube a little deeper out of the stomach into the intestines to do two things. First to get the food from the tube into the intestines hopefully bypassing the "full" stomach trigger so I can eat and tube at the same time so that I can get full nourishment. Second I can tube feed for a few days to let the incision heal up properly and hopefully keep the food in my stomach from dribbling out around the incision.  &nbsp;  Well to do all this they have to twilight and tube you...well we got part of it right.  &nbsp;  I got down there with this asshole who worked on me today and he knew that I was nervous and I told him to make sure that I was pretty much out and all would go well. I also had told him I have higher tolerances to most narcotics and other drugs...which I do.  &nbsp;  Well I was wheeled into the little procedure room and he started to give me the sedative. Starts with 100 of Fentinol...well it comes in these carpi-jet tube things that you have to crack and setup...well if you do it right all the med makes it into the IV...if you do it like he does it 50% of it ends up on the patient and the other makes it into the IV...so for 100 units he only got in maybe 50 at best...so I was underdrugged. He was in a hurry and not paying attention.  &nbsp;  At some point I wake up during all of this...now it might have been when he yanked my old tube out and I started screaming bloody murder...because it hurt. I remember them tubing me...and I couldn't breath and had a coughing fit plus a panic attack...the manhandled me...or rather he did...it was just a big fucking mess and I remember balling because it hurt so bad. When I came a little more too in the recovery area I was already sobbing because it hurt so bad so I woke up or came too crying. I don't cry from pain often...but when I do it is because something really hurts.  &nbsp;  While I was down there I was wiped out and when one of the nurses came over to me I said to her "did what I think happened really happen to me?", she told me "if you ever come back down here make sure you only have Weinberg or Dubner, never the other two." I had two other nurses down there tell me the same thing. Basically I woke up in the middle of the procedure and instead of stopping or getting the situation under control before continuing he just plowed ahead and basically beat me up.  &nbsp;  When I got back to my room my mom was here and she asked me what happened because I was bruised and beaten looking. I was beaten up pretty bad. I recovered quickly and I am sore and swollen but I am not to much worse for wear except that I cannot believe that is the second doctor from this service that I have had that have caused me harm. There is no reason for all of this. The only thing that can be on this one was that I was the last patient (which I was) and he was in a hurry...plus he had someone observing. So he might have been showing off and in a rush. Hey...slow down and do it right.  &nbsp;  So when I see my Doc tomorrow I am going to bring it up because I don't want others to go through that.  &nbsp;  I try not to complaign to much about things because I don't want to be a whiney bitch about things. Unfortunately this time I am going to have to be a whiney bitch.  &nbsp;  Well I have some drugs coming to me now so I am going to do them...veg. and hopefully enter tomorrow with the hopes that it will be better.  &nbsp;  Peace

      I am sitting here watching "Secret Window". One of the respiratory care people brought it in for me to see. That is probably the biggest saving grace of all this mess is that the people here make me feel as part of their extended family and help as much as they can. They constantly offer to bring me food or movies, always asking if there is anything they can run and get for me. It makes me feel good that at least I am doing something right somewhere.  &nbsp;  Of coarse I rarely take them up on the offers because I don't want to put them out, although I know that it wouldn't be a bother for them at really. The thing that I do take people up on is the movie thing. If people have a DVD that I haven't seen and they offer I always take them up on it because I love watching movies. I will say that there is one disadvantage to this laptop and the smaller screen size. It is harder to watch a movie and do other things on it at the same time. It can be done and I am doing it now but it is cramped. The other thing that I really need to do is to get this thing upgraded to 512MB of RAM. The 256 works well but the graphics subsystem does pull from the main memory of the unit. So right now with 256MB of RAM installed I pull 16MB for the Graphics system and that leaves me with 240MB of RAM available for program use. It is an odd number and some programs that I would love to use have to have at least 256MB. The biggest problem with being short of RAM is that the hard disk spins more and the computer just has to work harder. So 512MB of RAM is in the near future. I also have to save for the Averatec Tablet PC...that looks like it will be a good system. I still have yet to find out the specs for sure on it but for 1300 bucks you cannot go wrong at all. Pretty soon I may be sitting here writing my blog entries and watching a DVD on this machine. If I do get the Tablet PC then I will not upgrade this one...I will instead make sure the Tablet PC is maxed out with RAM as it would be more usefull there.  &nbsp;  Oh so much to see and do...plus I would love to build a new desktop just to build one.  &nbsp;  I would use the majority of the components that I already have like the high end P4 running over 3Ghz, 1024MB DDR500 RAM, 120GB SATA HD, 60GB PATA HD, good video card, DVD Burners (I have two...w00t! but I want to move to a Dual Layer DVD+-R/RW and I can do that for 90 bucks), WiFi 802.11G card. I would roll all those into a newer system maybe based off of the Aria case and a Micro-ATX motherboard. I would love to add a HDTV tuner card from ATi, a much better sound card (perhaps a high end SoundBlaster Audigy2).  &nbsp;  I would love to add 2*74GB Western Digital Raptor 10,000RPM in a RAID0 Array and that would be hella fast, plus the 120GB SATA as a backup drive for videos and music. I do have my eye on a system from Shuttle, it is a new one that has the new P4 packaging, new chipset, and it will accommodate 3HD's, one optical drive, PCI Express graphics and a HDTV card. However that would mean I would have to get the two HD's, new Proc. (at a slower speed than what I have now because to get where I am now in Proc under the new packaging would be expensive, plus I would have to get an ATi X800 video card for the PCIe...that is major moola...that is why I am leaning towards the Aria case, and a Micro-ATX motherboard, and just add bits as I need them. Down the road I could use the case and upgrade to a board with the newer features and such.)  &nbsp;  That is all off in dream land of what I want to do...if I did all that&nbsp;I would love to save and get a big LCD flat panel (like around 30inches HDTV) so I could compute and work on it but it would be good for TV here in the hospital and watching movies...not to mention kick ass gaming. I would love to do all that because once I get through all this shit I could use it in an apartment and have a hell of a setup.  &nbsp;  I have so much I want to do...and I need to get moola to get there. Its just a lot of dreaming right now. However I will get somehow, somehow the Tablet PC...that would just be cool as hell...also Averatec offers a good mainstream PC 15.4 widescreen, P4 3.0Ghz (Hyperthreading enabled), 512MB RAM, 60GB HD, DVD+-R/RW drive, ATi 9600 Mobility 64MB RAM...Basically a good solid portable gaming machine. That one costs about 1300 as well. So if I could I would get two new laptops, the gaming edition and the TabletPC one...if I did that I would ignore altogether the desktop system with maybe a tansplant of cases to something a little more roomy with a better MOBO room for my DVD Burners, lots of HDs...and have it on a network so that I can use it as storage and brawn setup or something...I dunno I am rambling...really really rambling.  &nbsp;  This is a shit post I am sorry. I am bored...so much I want to do but not the energy or seemingly at the moment the mental acuity to do anything...  &nbsp;  BLAH!!!

      Today has been just a crap day and that is all I want to say about it. &nbsp; I hope I can have some nice days where I feel good and have the energy to feel good. &nbsp; That is all...I sat there for a few minutes to see if anything would come to me and low and behold not a damn thing did. &nbsp; Shit.... &nbsp;
